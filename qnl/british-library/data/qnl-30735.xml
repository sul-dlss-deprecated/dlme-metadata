But neither would the action be connned to Russia and Great Britain. Prance and Germany would unquestionably appear upon the scene. The disastrous contagion of Kiao-chow would be reproduced; and the Persian Gulf—for 100 years, so far as political predominance is concerned, a British lake—would become a second Gulf of Pechih, to he quarrelled over and parcelled out by the greed of rival Powers. Ihis is no fanciful picture of the imagination. It is an indisputable deduction from the circumstances of the case. 19. Finally, let me contemplate the effect that would be produced by the concession of a Persian railway and a Persian port to Russia upon the general problem of Indian defence. A glance at the map 'will show that India would then be surrounded in a ring fence by Russia and her ally. Following this line from West to East I have already shown the position at which Russia aims as threatening the entire western borders of Baluchistan and Afghanistan from the Persian Gulf to Herat. Herat itself could be taken by the Russians in less than three weeks. From Herat to the Oxus the Afghan frontier is at the mercy of the Russian forces. The course of the Oxus from Charjui to the Pamirs is now under their control. They can cross it at any point at any time without our knowledge and without the possibility of interruption. W e are obliged even now to keep a close watch upon the northern passes of the Hindu Kush. East of the Pamirs, the Russians have already taken up a position in the Taghdumbash Pamir, which will presently make their frontier adjacent to our own on the Mustagh Range. The fall of Kashgar and Chinese Turkistan is absolutely certain and cannot very much longer be delayed. Tibet will still intervene between Russian territory and our own on the north ; but already rumours of a Russian Protectorate have been heard, and a mission from Lhasa has been received by the Tsar. On the extreme east of British territory in Burma, we encounter the rival ambitions and expanding influence of France, whose aspirations do not fall short of the complete absorption of the kingdom of Siam. It is far from improbable that within twenty, perhaps within twelve, years from the present time, the metaphor previously employed will have been justified, and the Indian Empire, along the complete length of its land frontiers, will be coterminous with the territories, and confronted with the ambitions, of Powers whose interests are on the whole inimical to its own. In such a case— and it is no idle dream of fancy, as the future will show—we shall not be able to move, to strike, to advance, in any part of the world where French or Russian interests are involved, because of the menace that will stand perpetually at our Indian doors. Of the strain upon Indian finances, I do not at present speak : but it would be altogether in excess of our means. In this ring fence there are at present three gaps : the still independent kingdom of Siam on the east, the portion of whose territories lying nearest to the Indian frontier has been guaranteed by a Convention between Great Britain and France; on the north the upland wilds of Tibet, as yet impervious to alien intrusion ; and on the west the dominions of the Shah. These are the sole remaining buffers that separate the Asiatic possessions of Great Britain from her European rivals. It rests with British statesmanship to retain all three intact. But it will sacrifice the most important of their number if it knowingly concedes to Russia that gratification of her ambition in Eastern Persia, the consequences of which to the British Empire it has been the object of this Minute to expose. October 28th, 1901. Curzon. Foreign Office Press—No. 1615—2-11-01—54,k a- Khorassan. D. No. 21-F. No. 19 A., dated Meshed, the 11th February 1899. From— Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Temple, Agent to the Governor-General of India and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for ^Rhorasan and Seistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to telegram dated 9 th February 1899, I have the honour to forward copies of Captain Sykes’ despatches addressed to Her Majesty s Secretary of State regarding Seistan. 2. In the despatch dated the 17th January 1899, he says that &lt;c the Gov ernor of Seistan and his entourage are at a loss as to the object of my appoint ment, as they say there is but little British trade and no British subjects (sic) in Seistan.” 3. As to this, I would observe that I have not heard that there are any Russian subjects or any Russian trade in Seistan, notwithstanding this the Russian Government proposed last summer to establish a Russian Consulate in Seistan. It is plain, therefore, that they appreciate the importance of the matter. 4. Captain Sykes goes on to say “ what with a Consulate General at Meshed and a staff of intelligent men at Robat, one of whom is frequently in Seistan, our interests do not at present require more than the occasional pre sence of a Bolitical Officer.” As to this I would beg to point out that the subordinates of Lieutenant Webb-Ware at Robat have no authority to go into Persian territory to look after the interests of traders who have passed into Persia from Baluchistan, although these subordinates may cross the border to obtain supplies, etc. The British Consulate General at Meshed is balanced by the Russian Consulate General at this place. At Turbat-i-Haidari between Meshed and Seistan, the Russians have two Russian officers, a doctor and ten cossacks; while at Karez, also south of Meshed, they have an officer, a doctor and ten cossacks and two assistants to the doctors. The Russian Government have besides employed Native Agents in Seistan since 1891, Rahim Khan Marvi and Haji Agha ; Saiyid Husain, Ali Naki Mirzuaff have at different times been appointed as Russian Agents; latterly the Russian Agents have been the Customs Sub-Con tractors, Mirza Muhammad Husain and Mirza Abdulla Makui. The business of the last two men being to collect customs in Seistan, they have special faci lities for supplying information to the Russian Consul-General, and also ham pering British traders, on the plea of recovering from them customs dues. To (1? Seistan was appointed) -W counterbalance these very significant Russian arrangements we have ^hitherto sent officers to travel occasionally through Seistan. A British Consul to counterbalance the appointment of a Russian Consul to that place, and not in cohsequence of the Russian arrangements detailed above. I cannot agree with Captain Sykes that our arrangements do not require more than the occasional visit of a Political Officer. If it is worth the while of Russian to employ so many persons on the pushing of Russian trade in the direction of Seistan, I would venture to urge that it is necessary for us to do at least as much, otherwise British trade and influence in Persia will both dwindle to a very low ebb. 5. Captain Sykes proceeds to say “ to make a fair comparison when appointed to Kirman I found perhaps 50 cases awaiting disposal * * . Upon reaching Seistan, on the other hand, I find sis British subjects he^^in 0, their way to Meshed.” J os ° With regard to this I would beg to point out that the Bandar Abbas route has long been open, while the Nushki-Seistan route has only lately been opened. A number of cases for disposal is hardly to be expected at first. Before cases can arise traders should be assured that the route is open and safe, and that they will not be either'robbed on the road or find that their 810 F. D.

With resnect to the proposal that Captain Sykes should retire to Kirman, ■ -its-.- is •; sssr r&amp;rxarwss already old and at such a distance, an effective enquiry is not practicable Tinder the circumstances, I wouldrecommendthat Captain Sykes should, after the commencement of the hot weather, remain in the lulls near Seistan or at Biriand • one of the customs sub-oontraetors Muza Abdul a khan resides at Biriand Captain Sykes should have a subordinate who could watch the pro- ceedin-s of Mirza Muhammad Husain, the other sub-contractor, at Nasratabad in Seistan Unless measures of the kind indicated are taken, I wouid beg to point out that it will not be possible to counterbalance Russian ascendency m Seistan and Southern Khorassan. In addition to the Russian officers at Turbati-Haidari and Karez, there are Persian sowars who are paid trom Persian revenues through Russian officers at the following places Kalagak • 5 Jam sowars. Chahar Shamba Robat . • 4 Hazam sowars. Karez • • 5 Ditto. Karat . • • 5 Ditto. Duzbad • • • 4 Kkaf. Barabad • • • • 5 Ditto. Salami . • • • 5 Ditto. Rushkar . • 5 Karai. Turbat-i-Haidari . • • 5 Ditto. Zarmehr • • • • 5 Ditto. Turshiz * &lt; 5 Ditto. Badrashkan. • • \ 5 58 Ditto. sowars. Although these sowars are Persians, still they would naturally regard those who personally pay them as their masters irrespective of the source from which the funds are derived. In addition to all this Russian strength in Persia there is the garrison at Ashkabad. The authority and weight which it gives to the re presentations of the Russian Consul-General can easily he imagined. Russian trade is carried by the rail to Ashkabad and on a carriageable road to Meshed. Against this strength and these facilities it is extremely difficult for British trade to struggle, and the departure of the Consul for Kirman would still further weaken the position as regards British traders.3 7. With regard to the Quetta-Seistan route Captain Svkes writes I am ready to state in mV humble opinion the Quetta route is hopeless y handicapped by its natural disadvantages. Caravans require large quan i ies of supplies which can be procured at short intervals on the route an ar Abbas where the camel-grazing is as a rule rich and abundant. Tv 1 ,5 °, hand, Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh in his report of his]ourney on the Meshed- Quetta route between 7th April and 28th July 1898, paragraph 48, says, a Native trader of this place (Sarbisha), who returned from Bandar Abbas wi i his caravan about a fortnight ago, states that all Seistan caravans w r en to Quetta instead of Bandar Abbas last winter, and that some of the kain caravans £ were also thinking of following their example.” The same writer in paiagrap 166 of his report says “ that the Indian traders have not formed an unfavour able view of the new trade route, and they intend to advise their firms to sen their ?oods by it in future.” With the aid of certain ameliorations, such as the proyision of barley and fodder stores and the sinking of wells, “ to enable mule caravans to traverse the road with ease, the Nushki-beistan route would become the best and most popular road between India and Persia, and would attrac a traffic of pilgrims, travellers, traders and merchandise, going from India to the Provinces of Seistan, Khorassan, Herat, Bokhara, and lurkistan, andz;iC£ Prom figures supplied by Mr. Webb-Ware it appears that between Apul 18 7 and April 1898 the imports into Baluchistan through Nushki amounted to Rs. 3,05,608 while the exports reached Rs. 2,84,321-8, total Rs. 5,89,929 o. The report does not show how much of this trade passed acioss the Peiso-Ba u chistan border, but the results quoted are encouraging. There are also certain disadvantages in the Bandar Abbas route. The Quetta route is a little longer than that via Bandar Abbas, but the latter route is aH through Persian terri tory, while the former lies for about half its length in Baluchistan, and is under British protection. The Bandar Abbas route takes longer to traverse than the Seistan-Quetta route, and goods on the former change hands m transit. Much of the success of the Quetta-Seistan route will depend on the Consul in Seistan being able to arrange for the protection of caravans from the rapacity of Customs Collectors, after they cross the frontier, as well as from the loss caused by obstructive measures on the part of Russia, such as the imposition o a nlao'ue cordon, which, on the plea of guarding against the w r holly imaginary approach of that disease, was in fact a blow aimed at the opening of the nevv trade route. It has also to be borne in mind that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Shaukat-ul-Mulk are at feud and it would probably not be very difficult to fan the flame and produce disturbances which would be inimical to trade by both routes.^r ^ w ith commercial considerations. The Political and Military aspects of the case appear to be of far greater importance, but since they have not been controverted in the letter under consideration, and as they are well known, I need not enlarge on them. In view of these considerations, the Quetta-Seistan route is of the greatest importance, and it appears to me that the interests of this route will not be furthered by pressing the rival claims of the Bandar Abbas route. Prom Captain Sykes’ despatches it appears that he intends to press the claims of the rival route. No. 1 Political, dated Seistan, the 11th January 1899. From—C aptain P. Moleswoeth Sykes, To— The Marquis of Salisbury, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. With reference to my journey from Kirman to Seistan, which was under taken with the object of establishing a Consulate in the latter district, I have the honour to make the following report In selecting a route my object was partly to show Mr. W. K. Wood, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, what was, in my opinion, the best direction for the Central Persia Telegraph line to follow while, at the same t time as x received instructions to meet the Political Officer in charge of the Ouetta-Seistan trade route at some point near the frontier, a direction was taken, by following which I was enabled to strike the above-mentioned artery of commerce, about which I was anxious to gain information.4 W Kirman was quitted on 19th October, a few clays after a courier had brought down instructions and our first stage was Mahun, where is the famous shrine of the Indian Dervish Shah Niamat-ullah. From this point the cara van route was quitted and we travelled to Te hran by a track not shown on the map, which proved to be more suitable for a telegraph line than the road followed by successive generations of travellers, the diflicult pass of Hanaka being avoided and the total mileage being less. At Bam we Were accorded a most friendly reception, the garrison and townpeople turning out to welcome our party, while during a two days’ halt supplies were laid in for the desert section that iay before us. One stage beyond Bam, we entered the district of Narmskir, which resembles many parts of the Punjab, both in its vegetation and temperature, there being a fall of nearly 5,000 feet from the second stage, south-east of Kirman to Ptigan, its chief village. Here we were on the western edge of the great desert, which stretches to the gates of Tehran to the north-west, while to the north its desolate expanse is almost as immense. I he most direct road to Seistan would have been followed by proceeding in a north-easterly direction from Azizabad, which lies midway between Bam and Bigan, this being a section of the great caravan route between Bandar Abbas and Sistan, which I hope, in a future despatch, to compare with its rival starting from Quetta. Ihere is no route shown on the map connecting Narmshir with Kwash. the capital of Sarhad, but as Mr. Wood had received instructions to examine the roads in this direction, inquiries were made, which elicited the fact that the desert could be crossed at this point. Thanks to the great courtesy invariably shown by the Kirman authorities a body of five men acquainted with the desert was ready to guide us, and after loading up a few camels with forage and water, we exchanged the thick tamarisk jungle of the Narmshir for the intense stillness of the desert. Owing to the severe drought, we suffered considerably from want of water while what was procurable could scarcely be termed wholesome. However 5 ue were better off than our horses and camels, who frequentlv had no w r ater for a period of thirty hours. Ihe track which we followed led past the northern edge of the Bazman T an ?on! V 0 C ‘- iet P, ea k rises to an elevation of more than 11,000 feet In Ib.M 1 enjoyed a superb view from its summit. o. , t] ; e Si f^ 1 da { af , ter leaving Bigan, we entered the monotonously uniform Smh Band or Black Bange which holds up Sarhad on the west, but it was not until we had crossed this mountain barrier that we enjoyed water that was ofTalad n ’ 0n the tGnth day We reached ^wash, the caphal Throughout these ten days we had not seen a solitary human being, while the signs of the drought were everywhere visible; many springs being dried ^’the camels ^ UP and afforded Httle 0r no nourishment At K ' yash where, in 1893, I had found a large garrison, the fort was noi )y i a W - lllle the Wack tents Lad been reduced to abou half the number that I had previously counted. Two of the Chiefs, whom I knew, were absent on visit to Sir Naoraz Kim and from all I could gather, the Kharan Sardar has great influence ?n Sarhad of the great volcL^ Kuhd-Stan.t r ° UDd ^ eaStern las1 A few feet from the summit our way was barred by an inaccessible cliff, so that we were not able to witness the working of the volcano, as I bad had done five years previously. At Ladis, which is a district consisting of some five small villages, to our amusement the Regi Chief, Muhammad Reza Khan, declined to visit us, on the grounds that he was a servant of the British Government and that I was a Russian “ Eelchi.” When matters had been explained, I found that the Sardar was supplying men for some of the posts on the Quetta-Seistan route, and, con sequently, felt bound to act in the manner described. He told me that, in July last, two Russian explorers and naturalist had travelled from Seistan to Bazman and had thence visited Bampur and Pahra. From the capital of Baluchistan they had marched to Kwash and thence to Ladis. This latter district was reached early in August, to judge by a letter shewn me and the explorers, who formed a very small party, finally returned to Sistan, where I hope to gain further information as to their move ments. Ihese details appeared to me to be of interest, as rumours of the pre sence of Russian Surveyors, both at Ladis and Bampur, had been reported during the summer. After spending Christmas day in this district, our party temporarily broke up, Mr. TV ood travelling due west to try and discover a less difficult route through the Sarhad Hills than the one we had followed while, as I was in hopes of hearing from Captain Webb-Ware, the Political Officer in charge of the trade route, I travelled north-north-east to Kacha Kuh, where I saw one of the series of posts that have been constructed along the road. Captain Webb-Ware wrote to inform me that, owing to the necessity of carrying all supplies from India, he would be nearly twenty days later at the frontier than he had expected, while he also informed me that an escort was on its way to join me. Upon receiving this information, I determined to halt a day at Kucha Kuh and sent on to Sistan for supplies, of which we stood urgently in need, only eight days’ rations having been procured at Ladis and that at famine rates. Upon the arrival of the escort, which fortunately occurred upon the fol lowing day, as my main object was to forestall the Russian Vice-Consul, the march was immediately resumed to Kuh-i-Malik Siah in cold weather: 22° of frost being registered one morning at 7 a.m. On the 2nd January we reached the new “Robat*’ which has been constructed on the confines of Persia and Afghanistan, and which much resem bles a peel tower, while the frowning hills and rugged water-courses form a suitable back ground. The actual point where the three boundaries meet is a comparatively low black hill, which was evidently selected as being the first elevated spot, that is seen by a traveller from the north and is situated some 12 miles to the north of Robat. Mr. Wood rejoined me at Hurmak, one stage further north, where we left the hills and entered the steppe of Seistan, the level character of which is particularly noticeable after being among hills for a considerable period. I have been much struck by the resemblance between the districts of Sarhad and Palestine, while a similar likeness exists between Seistan and Egypt. Just as, in the book of Genesis, the Nomad Shaikh Jacob is forced to seek corn in Egypt, so, to-day the Sarhaddi Chiefs, who perhaps occupy a similar position in the scale of civilization have seen their fountains and their wells dry up one by one, while their flocks daily diminished in number until, to save their familes from starvation, they have been forced to cross the desert stages which lay between them and Seistan, where, as in Egypt, the land depends upon a river and an annual inundation, which is rarely known to fail. The sight of the great lake, which is of sufficient extent to suggest the sea, in addition to the stretch of desert, tends to complete the parallel. In conclusion, the action of His Majesty’s Government, both in British and Persian Baluchistan during the past year, together with the news of the 810 F. D.6 crowning victory at Omdurman, lias raised our prestige to the highest point it has perhaps ever reached in .Baluchistan, while the fact that the Reki tribesmen of Ladis, who are employed at the various posts are regularly and generously paid, is also known far and wide; moreover, it offers an excellent object lesson as to British methods of procedure, and naturally, it increases the eagerness shown by Baluchis of all classes to obtain shelter under the aegis of the Pax-Britannica. As a second point, it is evident that Sir Naoroz Khan of Khuran has more influence in Persian Baluchistan than any Persian Sardar that I know of, my movements being regularly reported to him throughout the journey by various Chiefs, all of whom appeared to be anxious to court his favour. Finally, the drought has almost depopulated Sarhad and this factor tends to add to the general feeling of unrest prevailing throughout the country. No. 2 , dated Seistan, the 17th January 1^99. From—C aptain P. Molesworth Sykes, To—The Right Hon’bi/e Marquis op Salisbury, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Upon reaching the first village of inhabited Seistan, on 9th January, I sent my Persian Secretary, with the exequatur and other credentials to Nasratabad, the capital, while our party halted. Upon visiting Mir Masum Khan, who is a grandson of the famous Mir Alum Khan, Amir of Kain, such excellent arrangements were made that, not only the Governor’s servants came out to meet us, but the Governor himself headed them. Under the present circumstances, the result was most satisfactory by Persian etiquette ; this is the highest honour that can be paid, so that it pre cludes the representative of Russia from being received with higher distinc tion than myself. I had been joined by an escort of fourteen sowars on the frontier and upon receiving information of the success achieved by my Secretary Nasrulla Khan, to whom, in my opinion, the greatest credit is due, we marched across the level plain, attended by an official sent down to receive us, to the village of Chilling, where we halted for the night. Owing to the numerous irrigation channels, which, if deep, were generally innocent of bridges, our baggage suffered considerably : many camels falling into the waiter with their loads. Nothing broke the intense evenness of the plain, except the Kuh-i-Khaja, a low flat-topped hill that, in the British empire would assuredly be termed “ table mountain.” The second day, about six miles from the capital, a tent was erected while a halt was made, to allow of uniform being donned. The cavalcade, headed by two Turkomans, who had brought down a post and followed by the cavalry escort, arranged to the best advantage, was first met by four led horses, the servant in charge naively apologizing for their scanty number by saying that the Sartip himself had all his servants with him on horseback. Three miles from Nasratabad a body of a hundred horsemen, headed by Mir Masum Khan, rode forward and, after shaking hands and introducin''- Mr. Wood, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and the Native Officer, the united party proceeded to our camp where the garrison, one hundred and fifty strong and armed with antiquated fire-locks, was drawn up in line, a weird fanfare being sounded by the band. The Governor, after remaining for half an hour took his leave, and we were able to settle down in camp. The next day I returned the visit and rode to the west gate, after enter ing which, we turned to the right, skirted the collection of dilapidatedf- I mud hovels constituting the town, and passed through a second gateway into the fort. Dismounting at a narrow door, we traversed the shabbiest of courtyards with a dirty duck-pond in the centre and, entering the meanest of chambers, which was not even whitewashed, were greeted by the Sartip. Without his sun-glasses Mir Masum Khan appeared to be a young man of perhaps twenty-five. His father, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, is, I understand, the official ruler of Seistan and Tabas, but preferring the latter place, Mir Masum Khan is ef de facto ” Governor. What particularly struck me was the utter ignorance shown of even other parts of Persia, while I myself brought the first news of my own ap pointment, and it is unknown as yet that a Russian Yice-Cousul has also been appointed. I am informed that the Governor and his entourage are at a loss as to the object of my appointment. As they say, there is but little British trade and no British subjects in Seistan. Although it would be premature to give a final opinion on this subject, so fas as I can judge, what with a Consulate-General at Meshed and a stall of intelligent men at Robat, one of whom is frequently in Seistan, our interest do not at present require more than the occasional prresence of a Political Officer as during the summer all trade ceases and there would be little or nothing to do. To make a fair comparison, when appointed to Kirman, I found perhaps fifty cases awaiting disposal, while fresh ones were constantly occurring in Makran alone, forming no inconsiderable total. Upon reaching Seistan, on the other hand, I find six British Indian sub jects begging their way to Meshed and a solitary case of little importance. There is also no house in which a European could live, and during most of the summer, according to Dr. Bellew, the heat is excessive, while the whole district reeks with malaria. If the Russian Vice-Consul reaches Seistan this spring and attempts to remain, it would appear to be my duty not to move far away, so, given that contingency, I would venture to propose that I should spend the summer in the adjacent hills, while Birjand might be added to my district, if it be con sidered advisable to take advantage of my presence to influence the Kain district of which Birjand is the capital. Until quite recently, both districts were under the same ruler. Given, however, that the Russian Vice-Consul fails to put in an appear ance, I venture to think that it would be better for me to return to Kirman for the summer. The length of this latter journey would be considerably under four hundred miles, while arrangements could easily be made for a news- writer, by borrowing one of the Robat staff. This is not the time to fully compare the Quetta route with its rival from Bandar Abbas, but I am ready to state, that, in my humble opinion, the Quetta route is hopelessly handicapped by its natural disadvantages. Caravans require large quantities of supplies, which can be procured at short intervals on the route from Bandar Abbas, while the camel-grazing is, as a rule, rich and abundant. To take the Indian route, absolutely nothing is procurable west of Nushki. Add to this the route is very stony in parts and the elevation generally high, which results in strivelled up camel-grazing during the winter months. It may perhaps be considered that I am giving a premature opinion, but I have been carefully studying the question for some years and am perhaps the only official competent to compare both the natural and artificial ad vantages of the routes, o I understand that Captain Webb-Ware is bringing four months’ supplies from India, the significance of which fact requires no commentary. Of course, all this may be changed by means of bounties or by bringing areas under cultivation, which are now desert, but I venture to think that itV • ^ is to the interest of Government that the present state of the case should be known. I am returning to the southern edge of the oasis to-morrow, where I hope to confer with Captain Webb-T^are* Mr. Wood will thence return to Rigan and continue his journey, while I expect that Mr. Tate, of the Survey of India, will join me and take advantage of my presence for survey operations.\ Khornsan. D. Mo. iia-F. No. 23-A., dated Meshed, the 18th February 1899. From— -Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Temple, Agent to the Governor-General of ~ a • - - - - 7 n _ India, and Her Britannic Majesty^ Consul-General for Khorasan and Seistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 19-A., dated the 11th February 1S99, I have the honour to forward a copy of despatch (sent to me under flying seal) No. 3, dated 1st February 1899, from Captain Sykes, to the address of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Seistan. 2. Captain Sykes is of opinion that the effect of Captain Webb-Ware’s visit would “have been much enhanced had he been permitted to march with bis whole party to Nasratabad instead of coming to the outskirts of Seistan with only a few levies.” Captain Sykes further observes—“ The larger the parties are that visit Seistan and the more frequently they appear, the greater the political effect will be.” With reference to this, I would observe that the question was dealt with in paragraph 3 of your letter No. 3740-F., dated the 8 th November 1898, to the address of the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, in which it was said that “the party accompanying Lieutenant Webb-Ware is a large one, and that exaggerated reports both regarding its size and proceedings are sure to be made to the Russian authorities in Khorasan by their Agents in Seistan.” There is no doubt that in Persia, where correct information can only be obtained with great difficulty, unwelcome reports are apt to be presented in an inordi nately exaggerated form. 3. Captain Sykes says that he discussed with Captain Webb-Ware “the importance from the Indian point of view that Seistan and Kerman should be under the same Consul.” With reference to this, I would beg to point out that the view of Captain Sykes is contrary to the opinion of Colonel Yate who visited Seistan, and in his Report No. 10 (Camp), dated Camp Jalalabad (Seistan), the 11th March 1891, recommended a Consul for Kerman and Bandar Abbas and an Assistant to the Agent to the Governor*General for Kain and Seistan. Between Kirman and Seistan there is a great desert known as the Dasht-i-Lut, which more effectually separates Seistan from Kirman than the sea would. Nor is the view expressed by Captain Sykes that taken by the Native authori ties. Seistan is under the Governor-General for Khorasan, while Kirman is entirely separate. It appears to me that Captain Sykes’ arguments with respect to this point are very weak. There is no doubt a possibility that the raiding parties he refers to might escape from one district into another, but precisely the same argument is applicable to all districts wherever situated, and, as all districts must end somewhere, it would not be easy to find a more effective natural barrier than the Dasht-bLut. 4. Captain Sykes mentions two points which he says hear out his “opinion that only the occasional visit of aPolitical Officer is required.” This question was referred to in my letter No. 19-A., dated the 11th February 1899. With respect to Purdil Khan, Captain Sykes says, “if the authorities thought fit, he could he deprived of the villages at present in his charge.” With respect to this point, no information has reached me beyond that now given. Captain Sykes points out that there are sixty thousand cultivators whose wants appear to be extremely circumscribed. Even if, as Captain Sykes says, the Seistanis do not want candles or oil, it may be hoped that they have surplus produce to dispose of, and that there might he a sale amongst them of articles required for clothing which could he supplied by British traders. 5. In his last paragraph Captain Sykes says that the strategic value of Seistan will continue “as long as access to the Helmund he barred, or until2 European Engineers be employed to construct engineering works on its upper reaches.” It would appear that, even if access to the Helmund were not barred, the strategic importance of Seistan would remain. Lines of railway or roads, running east and west or north and south from Chahbar to Meshed, would in all probability pass through Seistan. i No. 3 Political, dated Seistan, the 1st February 1899 From— Captain P. Molesworth Sykes, To—The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In continuation of my previous despatch, I have the honour to report that Captain Webb-Ware, Political Assistant, Chagai, as well as Mr. G. P. Tate, of the Survey Department, reached Wurmal, the most southerly village in Seistan, on the same day as our party. After snending two days at Wurmal, Captain Webb-Ware, followed by Mr. W. K. Wood, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, marched back to the British frontier post of Kobat, while Mr. Tate and myself proceeded to the Kuh-i-Khoja, the position of which was fixed. On the following day Mr. Tate quitted me to fix other points, which he was successful in doing, so that the Native Surveyor attached to me will be able to produce the first correct map of Seistan and also survey in any direction in which I may subsequently be sent. The visit of Captain Webb-Ware has, I believe, produced a good political effect which would, however, have been much enhanced had he been permitted to march with his entire party to Nasratabad, instead of coming to the outskirts of inhabited Seistan with only a few levies. As I pointed out, the two posts of Kucha Kuh and Bug being on Persian soil, his entire party had already crossed the frontier, while, upon quitting Seistan, he intended to march down south to Mirjawa, which would entail bein'*- on the Persian side of the frontier close on a hundred miles. I w r ould venture to urge that what is needed is to show the proximity of India to Seistan, and, as the proverb runs, “ Pill the eyes of a Persian”: the larger the parties are that visit Seistan and the more frequently they appear, the greater the political effect will be. What I learned about the Quetta trade route fully confirms what I stated in my last despatch—that it cannot compete wuth the Bunder Abbas caravan road on even terms. If, however, it be decided that, for political reasons, the route must be opened up, and, in my humble opinion, our policy in Persia demands this, liberal measures, involving considerable expenditure, will in all probability be necessary in order to attract caravans to this route. Other points that were discussed included the importance, from the Indian point of view, that Seistan and Kerman should be under the same Consul, as the trade route not only passes for a considerable distance along or through both districts^ but, unless this arrangement be made, the Local Governors will evade responsibility, or at any rate raiding parties will escape unpunished by crossing from one district to another. Captain Webb-Ware also agreed with me as to the importance, from his point of view, of influencing Kain, the Governor of which is believed to be a fervent Russophil. Besides explaining to me various questions in connection with the trade route, Captain Webb-Ware was able to give me much valuable information about Seistan, which he had visited two years previously. I have also to thank Mr. G. P. Tate for information about both frontiers,‘ about which he is a great authority. I am at present slowly travelling across Seistan to the River Helmund while the district is somewhat disturbed by the fact that the Hishmut-ul-Mulk is stated to be marching in this direction to expel his brothers-in-law the Narni Chiefs, and perhaps to remain himself in Seistan.I do not propose to deal with this question at present, but there are two points which appear to me to bear out my opinion that only the occasional visit of a Political Officer is required under present circumstances. Chief of these is the fact that the whole of the land in Seistan is Government property, so that there are no hereditary chiefs of any great importance. Just now Purdil Khan possesses considerable influence, but, if the authorities thought fit, he could be deprived of the villages at present in his charge. This course is now being adopted with regard to the Narni Chiefs, who will thereby become practically destitute. As a second point, Seistan is inhabited by perhaps sixty thousand cultivators, scattered about in villages, all of whom are of a very low type. There is practically no local trade, not even candles or oil being procur able, because there is no demand. When I add that no vegetables whatever are grown, I think that I have outlined the scale of civilization attained by the Seistanis, who are, as may be supposed, fanatical. It is perhaps unwise to attempt to forecast what line will be adopted by our northern rival, but I think that, given the importance of Birjand, no Consular Officer will permanently live in Seistan, at any rate not under the present state of affairs. At the same time, the strategical value of Seistan is very great and will continue to be so as long as access to the Helmund be barred or until European Engineers be employed to construct irrigation works on its upper reaches.Balu.

In continuation of letter No. 23 A., dated 10 th February 1899, I have the honour to forward a copy of letter No. 4, dated 14th February 1899, from Captain Sykes to the address of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, sent under flying seal. 2 . In this letter Captain Sykes compares the respective advantages of trade routes into South-East Persia. Although the Seistan route has certain dis advantages, political and military considerations point to the necessity for maintaining it in as efficient a condition as possible. No. 4 (Political), dated Seistan, the 14th February 1899. From —Captain P. M. Sykes, To—Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In the following despatch, I propose to compare the Quetta-Seistan trade route with the one running from Bunder Abbas to Seistan. One enclosure. There is, indeed, a third route, namely, that from Gwadur via Jalk, which, for some distance, runs through British Baluchistan, as a reference to the attached sketch will show. This route, if rendered safe, might form an even better line of approach from the sea than the present route from Bunder Abbas, and I hope that I may, at some future date, be permitted both to take up the question and erect the boundary pillars along the frontier, but, at the present time, the Persian port absorbs the entire traffic. In describing one caravan route as being better than another in a country where camel transport alone is used, chief among the points to be considered, when the question of distance is disposed of, is the presence or absence of water with its quantity and quality, the abundance or scarcity of good camel grazino-, the existence along the route of villages where barley flour, or cotton seed for the camel and bread for its driver may be procured, the roughness and difficulties of the road, and, finally, whether the journey throughout lies in “ hot” or “ cold” country, to use the Persian expression. In addition to these points the security of the country to be traversed as well as the various imposts and dues, have to be carefully weighed before* arriving at a decision. I propose, in the first instance, to describe the Quetta-Seistan route, a por tion of which I have traversed, while for the long stretch from Quetta to the Persian frontier, thanks to the Assistant Political Officer at Chageh, I have been able to collect the following particulars, which are sufficient for the purpose. From Quotta to Robat, 497 miles. Using this route, the distance from Quetta From Robat to Sehkuha, 90 miles. t O the last British post at Bobat is W hundred and ninety-seven miles, according to the list of stages supplied to me and the distance on to Sehkuha, the first important village in Seistan, is ninety miles, the total thus aggregating five hundred and eighty-seven miles. From Qaetta to Seistnn, 587 miles. 1&lt; 5 As far as Nushki, a distance of ninety-six miles, the track descends from 5,500' at Quetta to 3,050' at Nushki, which, under the fostering influences of British rule, is rapidly developing into a small town. On this section ol the route the question of water and supplies presents no great diliiculty, but the road is hilly and the section is distinctly “ cold ” country. West of Nushki, however, there is no village or hamlet until the end of the iourney, or for nearly five hundred miles. As far as the 1 ersian frontier, which is crossed at the Kacha Kuh, some iour hundied and forty miles from Quetta, the route or rather this section of it runs through “ hot ” country, but between Kacha Kuh and Robat, the altitude is again high. The water-supply is small, and, in places, bad, although efforts are being made to remedy this, while the camel grazing is most indifferent. At Amir Chah, three hundred and fifty-nine miles from Quetta, many caravans, perhaps a majority, break off and follow a more direct route through Afghan territory, but it is to be feared that this state of affairs is only temporary, as the Amir is anxious to take advantage of the trade, so it is reported, and will impose the usual prohibitive dues. To continue, the hills are quitted at the Koh-i-Malik Siah, and the foot sore camels for the remainder of the journey can enjoy the soft ground, while the camel grazing is fair. Water is, however, of indifferent quality and scanty, and no supplies are procurable until cultivated Seistan be entered. As regards safety, there is not much danger from raids until the route approaches the district of Sarhad, known as “ the outlaws’ home,” the inhabi tants of which district, headed by the notorious Jend Khan, raid in every direction, and with such success that the road to Gwadur is closed, while all the neighbouring routes suffer considerably. In the matter of imposts, I under stand that Quetta is a free town, while the important step of abolishing all road taxes has been taken, but, as yet, arrangements have not been made by which re-exported goods can recover the dues paid at the port of entry. This is a question to which I have drawn the attention of the Political Assistant at Chageh. The usual 5 ^ is levied in Persia, and there have been attempts at extortion reported, but nothing of importance has been proved. Captain Webb Ware is endeavouring to remedy the ruinous effect of want of supplies by placing merchants at the more important posts, who will barter cloth for grain, which will, generally speaking, be brought from Afghan territory. Granted, however, that this experiment be a success, caravans can only purchase supplies at a high rate owing to the cost of transport, while the Amir, at any time, may lay an embargo on the export of grain. The success or failure of the route may be considered to depend upon supplies being Report on the development of the Quetta-Seistan obtainable at reasonable rates, and this trade route, 1897-98. j s rec0 gnized by Captain Webb Ware, who writes as follows (page 23, section 16) :— “ Ihe question of supply shops is a pressing one. Trade will naturally not patronise a route along which supplies are unobtainable, and on which the carriage of the necessaries of life absorbs a high percentage of the profits.” From Nushki to Seistan would take a caravan some forty days, so that the weight of forage alone would be 1201 b, allowing 31b per diem a minimum ration. hen it is considered that an average load is 3501b, it is evident that more than a third of the loads must consist of forage, so that little or no profit can be realized. I regret to say that, since my arrival in Seistan, everv merchant, V 0 trl(X * tlle .Quetta route, declines to use it again, alleging the searchy of supplies and grazing, with the consequent heavy mortality. Let us now turn to the route from Bunder Abbas, which I have partly travelled along and have crossed at several points. ^ ^ 23 Prom Bunder Abbas to Rigan is two hundred and fifty-four miles and Bunder At&gt;tm8 to Rban, 254 miles. thence to Sehkuha, two hundred and forty- itigan to Sehkuha, 242 miles. ^ wo m ii eSj total distance thus aggre gating four hundred and ninety-six miles, or some 16 % less than the British route, a very important consideration. To first take the question of water, the supply on this route is good as far as Rigan, but, thenceforward, it is even more scanty than on the Quetta road. As regards supplies, grazing and altitude, there is, however, no compari son, as there are small towns and villages studded along the road, as far as Rigan and beyond, while the village of Nasratabad breaks the desert section into two. The camel grazing generally is as good as that on the Quetta road is indifferent, while the route lies in “ hot ” country, except for three or four stages near Seistan. With respect to the latter point, it may be as well to explain that a route should be either “ hot” or “ cold” country, so that caravans can select the season of the year when the grazing is good. If, however, both “ hot” and “ cold” country have to be alternately passed through, the result is obvious. As a slight set off to these advantages, there is a toll of Is. 8 c?. per camel taken at Dalian Abbas Ali, some thirty miles south of Rigan, while raids from Bashakird are, by no means, a thing of the past. Elsewhere the route is fairly safe, as it is almost out of the reach of Jend Khan, to end whose depredations is my anxious desire. To compare the routes, that from Quetta is nearly a hundred miles longer, while in the question of supplies, grazing and altitude, the Bunder Abbas route is much preferable. As to the respective advantages of Quetta and Bunder Abbas, the former town is not only several hundred miles from the sea, but I understand that the freights of the Bolan railway are extremely high. In the above comparison I have only referred to the routes as running to Seistan, but the ultimate goal is Meshed or even beyond, Seistan itself, with its savage population, absorbing very little in the way of imports. The main Khorassan route avoids Seistan altogether, so that the advantage of distance is considerably greater when the whole length of the route to Meshed be considered. Although I think that it will be conceded that, as regards European goods, the Quetta route cannot, at present, compete with its rival, there appears to be a great opening for the Indian route in the export of tea and perhaps indigo. It is generally understood that a sea voyage causes tea to deteriorate, but, apart from that, the Kangra valley is as near Quetta as it is to the ports of Karachi or Bombay. In addition to this, there is no reason that a large local traffic should not spring up, especially as the Amir practically closes all the direct routes, but, as I have ventured to point out above, supplies must be procurable, the whole question hinging upon the fact that, for nearly five hundred miles, there is no village or hamlet along the road, which state of affairs must be altered. As far as the question of the Seistan Consulate is concerned, I would submit that, as the majority of caravans never enter Sustan, which is impas sable for many months and always risky, while they all pass through Ghaia territory, it is important that our influence should be established at Birjand, although I would not recommend that Seistan be neglected. I have mentioned in a previous despatch that Seistan looks to Birjand for both its garrison and the greater part of its officials, so that to leave its ruler in the toils of Russian intrigue would appear to be an inadvisable course, especially as all orientals are changeable to a degree.To turn to minor points, tlie arrangement begun by Captain Webb Ware has been completed by myself, and the post from Ilobatto Seistan, together with that section of the road, is now under the protection of Sardar Purdil Khan, the only influential Chief in Seistan. I may mention that he has already served the British Government, under his uncle Taj Muhammad, who was employed at Kandahar by the late Sir O. St. John. As Her Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan has arranged for a post to- join me to him, it would appear to be advisable to take advantage of this Khorassan-Quetta postal connection as a means of furthering trade, by allowing merchants at Meshed and elsewhere to use it. At the suggestion of the Political Assistant at Chageh, I have written to the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Meshed to propose that he should arrange with the branch of the Punjab Bank at Quetta, so that a mer chant or horse-dealer need not run the risk of carrying large sums on his person, but can be provided with a bill on Meshed or Quetta. In conclusion, I am afraid that it may be thought that I have not de scribed the prospects of the Quetta road in glowing terms, but it seemed to be better to give a comparison which, hy showing its actual position, might prove to those in whose hands its destinies lie, how necessary it is to provide the funds, by the careful expenditure of which Seistan may be brought nearer to India and British prestige be increased throughout Eastern and Southern Persia. It is, I would venture to urge, of paramount importance to take advantage of the proximity of our frontiers, and not to allow Russian trade and influence to he pushed to our very door, although, pending the day when the Helmand route will be open, it may not, perhaps, be advisable to attempt a more ambitious programme in what is, after all, one of the most sterile of the many deserts of Asia, 4 Port igc Office Prest—No, 423— 22-4-99 —64./ / , S / _ ' /’•?*. r -- L i ■ /, * C\) /if — 'S v No. 50-A., dated Camp Kuehan, the 22nd April 1899.

Since the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan was delimitated by the Commission headed by Sir Frederic Goldsmid in 1872, the River Helmund has changed its course to a considerable extent. I would^ therefore, S F—21-29—June. i2 FOEEIGN DEPAETMENT, — — 8 F 25 Direct correspondence between Afghanistan and Persia. propose in the present despatch to give some account of the water question, both because it is, I venture to hope, of interest, and also the question of the boundary is one which may again be referred to the arbitration of Her Majesty’s Government. The invasion of Seistan by Tamurlane or Timur “ the Lame,” who acquired his soubriquet as the result of an arrow wound in this province, is the one event which is indelibly impresssd on the native mind, and I consequently propose to commence my review from that period. &lt; A reference to Sketch 1 will show that the dam at Akva, at that time divided up the Helmund at a point now in Afghan territory, while it irrigated a district to the south of Seistan, which is now covered with ruins, whose presence has puzzled more than one traveller. The main stream, the Rud-i Nasru, ran north-west between the vast extent of ruins which are still known as Shehristan and Zahidun. Shah Rukh completed the barbarous massacre and destruction that was commenced by his sire and demolished the Band-i-Akva. Sketch II is drawn to indicate the course then taken by the Helmund * the Hauzdar district to south of Seistan was gradually left without water, and* the river, while maintaining the main Rud-i-Nasru as its principal branch, cut out a new channel encircling the three hills of Sehkuha, which were at that time uninhabited. This was the course followed by the Helmund until the second decade of this century, when the Hauzdar channel, the Sehkuha channel and the Rud-i- Nasru all dried up. The entire volume of water {vide Sketch III) then flowed in a northerly direction, cutting out a channel to the west of Nad-i-Ali, the original stream to the east of that hill fortress having also dried up. As what we now term Persian Seistan was left entirely without water, the Rud-i-Seistan was cut—a task of great difidculty—running to the north of* and parallel to the Sehkuha channel. Tins was the state of the river when Sir Frederic Goldsmid °-ave his arbitral decision, in which he made the Helmund the boundary from the Band-i-Seistan to where it discharged its waters into the &lt;i Hamun” or lake. Some eight years ago, however, the Helmund began to forsake the Nad- Sketch iv. }' Ali chaGn el&gt; breaking across what is ... known as Mian Kangi in various places until, some three years ago, a regular channel, known as the Rud-i Perian Tnd JeWabkd . 08 ylDS flourislli “8 of Jehanabod, Ibrahimabad.

In continuation of my letter No. 50 -A., dated the 22 nd April 1899 , I have the honour to forward a copy of letter No. 6 , dated 18 th April 1899 , from Captain P, M. Sykes to the address of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2 . Towards the close of his letter, Captain Sykes says that “ our Baluchis tan chiefs could never, if properly controlled, intrigue with a Russian Agent in Seistan.' As to this I cannot agree with Captain Sykes. I would point out that Sirdars, in all parts of the country, have constant disputes with their neigh bours, and that when these disputes are settled one party is almost always dis contented, and prone to appeal to any one who would be likely to espouse his cause. I think it would be extremely difficult to prevent this if there were a Rus sian Agent in Seistan. 3 . Captain Sykes observes : “ it rather strikes me that perhaps Russia has found out that there is no trade and has'therefore delayed sending a represen tative.' I doubt this view of the matter being correct. The Russian Consulate- General is, I believe, well informed in all particulars ; and they have means of creating trade through Armenians. These persons are to be found in most parts of Khorassan, where they engage in trade and purchase the products of the coun try and send them to Trans-Caspia where they are carried to their destination by the Trans-Caspian railway. I have also heard it stated that some of these Arme nians are helped with respect to the necessary funds by advances from the Government. Should the Russian Government decide on a railway through Khorassan from Trans-Caspia, I believe a Russian Consular officer would have his time fully occupied. No. 6 -Political, dated 18 th April 1899 . From—C aptain P. Molesworth Sykes, To—-The Right Honourable the Marquess of Salisbury, K. G. In the following despatch I propose to summarize my impressions of Seistan, as I am proceeding to Birjand, after a stay of three months in the district, during which I have travelled all over it, besides spending nearly a month at Nasratabad, the seat of Government. My first visit to this fortified village, for it does not deserve the appellation of town, was limited to four days, as I had to march back southwards to meet the Political Assistant, Chagai ; but I was able to see, in spite of the splendid recep tion accorded to us, that there was great ignorance not unmingled with suspicion, as to our objects. To combat this state of affairs, I asked the Governor to supply me with an official during my tour, who would, I knew, watch my actions most closely and report them, which was what I desired, and, 1 think that it is partly owing to this that all classes have finally become so remarkably friendly. After meeting Captain Webb Ware, I travelled north-west to the Kuh-i-Khoja and thence marched by short stages across Seistan to the Helmund, where the dam, a weak construction of tamarisk boughs, was inspected. Thence we returned to Nasratabad, thereby completing the tour of southern Seistan, which was surveyed at the same time.The Political Assistant, Chagai, had kindly procured a camp flagstaff for me and, upon returning to the capital, the flag was hoisted for the first time. Rather to my surprise, as I knew that most of the upper class had visited Meshed, there was much opposition shown by the Governor, while the attitude of the “ Mullahs ” was overtly menacing. Messages were so constantly sent, with absurd requests, that I declined to receive any further communication on the subject, except in writing and, for. two or three days, I anticipated trouble, but as I declined to move from my position, while the Governor was averse from committing himself on paper, the new status quo was accepted, while I finally received a most complete apology from the chief “ Mullah ” for his behaviour, which, he ingenuously, stated, had been solely dictated from fear of the consequences, had he not sided with the popular feeling. After remaining at Nasratabad, until this question, the happy solution of which put matters on a proper footing, and increased our prestige, was settled, I continued my tour round the north of Seistan. At two points I explored the lake on a raft constructed of bundles of reeds, which are tied together in a form similar to a bisected cigar, kor hours I was punted through high reeds, the haunt of countless wild fowl and a veritable El Dorado for naturalists, but open water was never reached, d he southern portion of the lake is quite different, the water there being perfectly open, while the rising off the water of immense numbers of swans, geese, and every other water-bird, produced a roar, for all the wmrld, like surf beating on rocks. We crossed the Rud-i-Perian, which is now, as I have explained in my last despatch, the main stream of the Helmund, at its mouth. We found three branches, averaging a hundred and fifty yards in width with several minor channels ; the river which was rising, was half-way up my saddle flaps, so that it was very anxious work with the camels, all of whom, assisted by several men got safely across, while nothing of importance got spoilt. The district of Mian Kangi, which we entered in this manner, is densely covered with tamarisk jungle, growing to a height of twenty feet, while there is a considerable amount of very slovenly cultivation carried on. The inhabitants are mostly of Baluchi origin, who have been encouraged to settle and protect the frontier, and it was pleasant to hear how unanimously Persian rule was favourably contrasted with that of the Afghan Governor, whose extortions have depopulated the district under his control, much to the benefit of Persian Seistan. More than one peasant narrated that no melons were grown on the Afghan side, as the soldiers would eat them without payment, while tea and sugar were smuggled across the frontier, all commerce having been strangled. There are some four hundred Afghan regulars stationed along the frontier, while at Farrah, the residence of the Governor General, there are said to be four thousand men, but this I doubt. The district of Mian Kangi was almost impassable, owing to the dense jun gle and the flooded channels, but, as the river was full, we w r ere obliged to march throughout its length as at one point only, does it run in a single branch; at Miluk we found a swift flowing river, where a month previously donkeys had been leisurely marched across. Our gear, to use the comprehensive naval term, was put on to rafts, and the horses all swam, although one or two were carried away and nearly drowned. Eight gourds were securely bound on to the back of each camel, and a swimmer with gourds pulled them in front, while a second man rode on their tails behind. In this manner, our twenty-five camels were towed across the seething torrent, quite passive and not making the slightest effort to swim. Upon returning to Nasratabad, we were greeted with the utmost good wall by the officials, w'ho showed the greatest readiness to meet my wishes in every way, as an instance of which I may mention that some soldiers who had insultedi 3 mKMtmmmmmmamrn two of my servants were immediately seized and a message was sent up that they would be flogged, either at my camp or in the town before my Secretary. As, however, the affray had not been at all serious, I decided to let the soldiers off, but the promptness shown, before I had made a complaint, was very grati fying. Throughout my tour, besides, to the best of my humble abilities, endeavour ing to establish British influence, I have been especially anxious to discover how our northern rival is regarded and, after a series of most careful enquiries, I am glad to say that I can now report a most satisfactory state of affairs. The Seistanis generally, and the Baluchis in particular, all look towards the east and south, while their local commerce is now mainly carried on with Quetta, their clarified butter and wool being exchanged for calico and occasionally a little tea and sugar, but their wants are few. The revival of the Seistan-Quetta route, the buildings erected along it and the other proofs of British activity have, no doubt, helped to increase our prestige, which the institution of a post, protected by Purdil Khan, the most influential local chief, cannot fail to favourably affect. Major Brazier Creagh, R.A.M.C., who was deputed to Seistan, in 1897 , on plague duty, was treated by the local authorities in a distinctly unfriendly manner and not altogether unnaturally, put this down to Russophil tendencies on their part. I am, however, convinced that it was only due to general suspicion, which he evidently failed to disarm, while his protracted stay, without any sign of the plague, only convinced the local authorities that he must have some other deep design. Again, the officials are quite twenty years behind other parts of Persia, and the Deputy Governor asked me quite seriously whether the British Govern ment ruled India or whether it had not been restored to the Indians ! Moreover the seat of the Wall is at Meshed, which is also the sacred city, so that their views are naturally influenced by these facts, while the garrison and all the officials come from Birjand or its district ; at the same time it is fully realized that Seistan is within the British zone of influence, and not the Russian. The so-called colossus of the north has, for some reason, maintained an authorized Agent in Seistan, but he has recently been dismissed and is now hostile to his former employers and anxious to be of use to us ; add to this, the subcon tractors of customs, both at Birjand and in Seistan, were also in Russian pay, but they have just been dismissed. As to the trade question, Seistan exports wheat to Birjand, whence Russian • goods are brought in exchange, but, upon the whole, the balance is, I think, in our favour ; however, the total volume is insignificant. No doubt Russia, by sending a clever and energetic Consul, supplied with plenty of funds, could create a party in Seistan and, more especially, at Nasrat- abad, but such a creation would be artificial and of no use to the Northern Power, except so far as it irritated us, or to use the phrase in vogue, created a pin-prick. Thanks to the barbarous policy of the Amir, there is no trade and conse quently, little if any, communication with Kandahar, while a glance at a large scale map will demonstrate that our Baluchi chiefs could never, if properly controlled, intrigue with a Russian Agent in Seistan, to any dangerous extent, so that Russia would, in my humble opinion, be wasting money, if an official were appointed for Seistan only. If, however, he were to receive his exequatur, both for Chain (Birjand) as well as for the delta province, he could perhaps be of greater value to Russia, but I hope to deal with that question later on. As a second point, I am profoundly impressed with the feeling that the new Quetta route cannot materially improve our commercial position in Eastern Persia, and I think that the comparison I have instituted with the Bundar Abbas road (Despatch No. 4 ) tends to bear out my views ; also I may mention that up to the date on which 1 left Se.stan, only one through caravan had passed each way.4 With the advent of Lord Curzon, a personal friend of the Amir, to ^ India, as Viceroy, is it useless to hope that His Highness may be induced to alter his suicidal policy and, once more, allow trade to find a passage across Afghanis- tan ? If His Highness be unwilling to freely open up his country, could it not be suggested that he need only guarantee the safety of two or three main arteries of commerce ? The cost of protection would be more than repaid by a transit duty and British goods would, once again, be freed from an up-hill and unequal struggle, in which they are steadily losing ground. Another point that I should like to touch upon is the fact that, although Seistan is capable of supporting perhaps a tenfold population, if the water were under proper control, 'that control cannot be established except in Afghan territory, as the Helmund only enters Persia at the delta, and a scientific dam would have to be constructed many miles upstream, possibly at the same point as the great dam of Akva or Avk, which was destroyed by the son of Tamerlane. This fact, I should venture to urge, is an important argument against any railway construction, until access to the upper reaches of the Helmund be feasible. One recommendation I have already submitted is that a smart Mahomedan, trained, if possible, at the Agent to the Governor-Generafs Office, Quetta, should be permanently established in Seistan, where he could keep the political author ities properly informed and also supervise the post, which I earnestly hope will also be made permanent, as it is a sure and safe method of increasing British prestige, of assisting trade and of linking up Meshed and India. In due course of time, I hope that a second Agent may be established at Birjand, to which town there is a Persian post from Meshed. In conclusion, I would again venture to repeat that, at present, there is little or no consular w r ork at Nasratabad, not a*single case of any importance having been brought before me and it rather strikes me that perhaps Russia has found out that there is no trade and has therefore delayed sending a representative. As matters now stand, if a suitable agent be established and the post be continued, an occasional visit from a Political Officer is all that is required, especi ally as I can now trust any small case that may occur to the good offices of the Deputy Governor. Seistan is, however, dependent upon Birjand both for its rulers and troops, so that I shall not consider that the subject is exhaustively dealt with, until I have carefully studied the question at the northern town.

In continuation of my letter No. 87 -A. of to-day’s date, I have the honour to forward a copy of Captain P. M. Sykes’ despatch No. 7 , dated 1 ith May 1899 , to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. No. 7 - Political dated Birjand, the nth May 1899 . From— Captain P. Molesworth Sykes, To—The Right Honourable the Marquess of Salisbury, K.G. I received instructions to proceed to Birjand, towards the end of March, but it was not until the second week in April that I was able to effect a start as transport was scarce and I had decided to carry a three months’ supply of forage and flour ; subsequent experience has shown the advantage of so doing, .as both wheat and barley are about four times as dear as in Seistan.5 The heat and flies increased daily towards the close of our stay, so that it was with considerable relief that we left Seistan behind. The direct road to Birjand runs across a portion of the lake that is usually dry until the end of March, but we were fortunate in crossing it two or three days before the spring floods, which were late, reached it ; failing this we should have had to march round the southern corner of the lake, thereby adding some sixty or seventy miles to our journey. At Baring we camped on the western edge of the lake, not far from a signal tower built by Nadir Shah, the conqueror of Delhi. Thence two more desert stages with a slight rise, brought us to the village of Zaimul-abad at the entrance to the hills. Three more stages—all of consi derable length—and we reached Duruh. where at an elevation of about 4,000 feet, we were once again in a tolerably cool climate. At this village I dismissed most of the camels, keeping sufficient to carry our loads and grain in two relays. This naturally necessitated a slow rate of progress, but I did not wish to enter Birjand before receiving precise instructions as to my position there, while the survey operations were much benefitted by the change. Upon returning to the Iran plateau, I have been much struck by the well* kept fields and numerous orchards, which contrast most favourably with the slovenly tillage in Seistan where, indeed, orchards practically do not exist. The reason is that, in Seistan, the Government owns the land, so that neither the headmen, who are frequently changed (their posts being bought and sold) nor the peasants, have any interest in making improvements. I think that, although there might be difficulties owing to the nature of the water-supply, the Persian Government would be well advised to gradually sell all the land, which the headmen and villagers, not to mention members of the ruling family, would be glad to purchase. If this course were adopted, the Persian treasury would receive substantial sums of money, while the proprietors would immediately set to work to improve their land and thereby raise Seistan to a level with other parts of Persia, as the improvements would include better accommodation, at any rate, for man, who, in Seistan inhabits a hovel worse than most Persian stables. From Duruh, instead of taking the direct road to Birjand via Sarbisha, I decided to march north along my postal route which is also of interest as being the Perso-Afghan frontier. At Tabas, which is the centre of a Sunni population, official instructions reached me to the effect that I was to be considered Consul of Kain, as I had requested, while the acting Consul General for Khorassan informed me that a Russian Consular Officer was on the point of starting for Birjand and Seistan. I consequently decided to march across the hills to the capital leaving half my loads and three of the sowars at Tabas. When a march distant from Birjand, following my usual practice, I sent my Persian Secretary ahead, to arrange for my reception. I had read in more than one report that the Governor of Kain or the Amir, as he is termed, was the reverse of friendly toward British officials ;at the same time, I felt that, if this were the case, the arrival of a Russian representative might be used as a means of demonstrating this feeling Accordingly, I impressed upon my Secretary that he must strike at the root of the matter and insist upon the Amir, besides giving me the usual reception paying the first call. The same evening I received the welcome information that everything had been arranged in a satisfactory manner the Amir finally agreeing to call first, and merely stipulating that his visit should be paid two days after my arrival and not at once. On the following day, I rode into Birjand, in full uniform, being met by a reception party, headed by Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, the younger brother qfthe Amir, who escorted us to a garden touching the town, which the. Governor had very kindly placed at our disposal and, after the customary tea drinking, we were left free to examine the garden-house, which consists of four or five rooms in two storeys. The garden is full of barberry bushes, the fruit of which makes a subacid preserve, much resembling red-currant jam. The morning subsequent to our arrival, the flag was run up, which brought down the Amir’s Vizier, to inquire as to the legality of our action, it being the first occasion on which any flag, except the Persian, had been hoisted in Kain territory. ' However, our explanations were readily accepted and I think that there will be no further question on this, to them, all-important subject. As agreed, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk called, upon the third day after our arrival, driving down with a large following from his garden, some two miles to the south. He is of medium height, about forty seven years of age, almost toothless, and wears spectacles: I understand, too, that he is addicted to opium smoking, which is terribly prevalent in this part of Persia. His manner was distinctly friendly, and he gave me an interesting account of Baluchi, Afghan and Turko man raids. The Soudan campaign and the Cape to Cairo line were fully discussed, the Amir being anxious to keep informed as to our victories, which have had an effect, even in Eastern Persia ; he considers us a distinctly aggessive power. Returning the visit, on the following day, we were saluted by a small guard- of-honour—the Amir preferring to keep the pay of the Birjand regiment, which exists mainly on paper—and ushered into a fair-sized garden-house, with a tawdry carpet and chandelier, while the view was quite spoiled by a ruined mud hovel in front. The Governor, wdio, as the result of opium smoking, is a very late riser, joined us in a few minutes, when he dilated on the scarcity of water in the Kain province. He next enquired about the plague, and appeared to be well up in the measures taken by the British Government, while he mentioned that the Russian Government had sent a doctor to Birjand in 1897 . I explained the position of the Quetta road and said that I had been amused at hearing that the small posts along it had been magnified into large forts. In this question the Amir show r ed considerable knowledge, while he has thoroughly grasped the iron policy of his neighbour, Abdur Rahman, the ruler of Afghanistan. As well as I can judge, so far, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk is anxious that I should form a favourable impression of him and, in every w T ay, he has been most cour teous. He is prematurely aged and has no children, so that his attitude may be that of contentment with his present position, coupled with the hope that neither Great Britain nor Russia will trouble Kain during his life time. He is shrewd and fairly well informed, having both visited Mecca and Tehran, while the readiness with which he has accepted the hoisting of the flag and also his agreeing to pay the first call tends to prove that he is, by no means, an Anglophobe. In conclusion, I think that I may claim to have been fortunate, both in prevent ing the possibility of higher honours being paid to a Russian Consul, by secur ing that I should receive the first call, and also in forestalling an official of that nation. To turn to the question of trade interests, so far, I do not see any reason to alter my opinion that merely an occasional visit by a Political Officer, with experi ence of Persia, is necessary, unless Russia founds a consular post in these dis tricts. # 6Although there is a considerable trade with Bundar Abbas, it is not in the hands of British subjects, while, as previously stated, there is but little through traffic along the Quetta route. At the same time, I am recommending the establishment of an Indian Post Office at Birjand, as well as in Seistan, with a competent newswriter for each dis trict, who would also be Post-master, at any rate, until the work became too heavy: at present, in my humble opinion, nothing further is needed in the way of a permanent establishment, but, I would venture to urge, that it is of importance that this modest scheme should be sanctioned and carried out without delay. G. C. Press, Simla—No, 359 F- D.— 1 57 99—'54* 71 No. 98-A., dated Mpshed, the 10th June 1899. From Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Tbmplb, A^ent to the Governor-General of India, and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Khorussan and Seistan, ^ 0 d he Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward my camp diary from Kachan to Meshed, via Bujnurd. If printed, I would beg that four copies may be forwarded. Diary of a March from Kachan to Bujnurd. 23rd Jpril Kuchan to Usuabad, 3 farsakhs, about 11 miles. Us u a bad is also called Yusalabad. Kurdi is the language of the common people, and the names of places are changed from the Persian. The night and early morning were cold. After leaving the town of Kuchan the road turns up the valley to the west. The valley is from 5 to 10 miles broad. Several villages lie on either hand. There is much cultivation, chiefly wheat. The road is an unmetalled track, but carriages of the kind in vogue in Ashkabad (Victorias) can be driven along it. The valley is well water eel, and many artificial water courses are crossed by the track. At a distance of about 9 miles, old Kuchan is reached, and about 2 miles further on lies Usuabad. It is a small village of about 50 huts watered by a spring and kanats. My guide was the same Nur Muhammad who had accompanied Colonel Yate. Old Kuchan was destroyed by three destructive earthquakes. One took place about 15 years ago. A second severe shock took place in 1893. On the 17th January 1895, an earthquake occurred, which completely destroyed the town. As exaggerated accounts of the amount of damage which had been done were rife, Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh was sent °to make enquiries on the spot. Great mortality took place in the baths and narrow bazars. The public buildings were either destroyed or damaged. The dome of the shrine of Sultan Husein of the family of the Imamzada of Meshed fell. The custom house and post office were both destroyed. The houses of the Shuja-ul-Dowlah, the Karguzar, the telegraph Sartip, the Beglar Begi, and several other minor officials all fell ; while the shops were alf in ruins. There had been over 1,100 shops in the town before the earthquake of 1893, a large proportion of which had been destroyed, and rebuilt only to be thrown down again. Prior to 1893 old Kuchan was said to have had about 4,000 houses, with a population of about 20,000 persons. After that earthquake the number was reduced to about 2,000 houses. A careful estimate made at the time on the spot showed that about 700 lives were probably lost in the earth quake. Common report (probably exaggerated) did then, and does now, place the figure at several thousands. Earthquakes are rife in this valley, Kuchan having been damaged or destroyed several times. So much so that the Persian Government had ordered the removal of the town to another site an order which was frustrated by interested persons. The house of the chief had been specially constructed of wood to resist shocks, but to no purpose. It fell with the rest. Great distress was caused by the people being rendered houseless in the depth of winter, the town becoming, to quote from the report made at the time, “ a mass of ruins. ” The earthquake was thus described :—“ A sound resembling the discharge of cannon is heard in the distance. After which the earth shakes for several minutes at a time The new town is built on a site at a hitherto safe distance. When I visited old Kuchan I found that the buildings and bazar described by Lord Curzon in “ Persia,” Volume I, had vanished, the damaged remnants of the shrine being the hightest building visible. All that remains of the more substantial buildings are masses of masonry lying about asthey had fallen, in wild disorder. No p-irt of the town walls is standing, but the site could easily be trace;l. The old town had two gates—the Meshed gate and the Shirwan gate. The doors of both I saw still lying on the ground. Since this crowning disaster some houses have sprung up, so built that they could not fall down. Barked trees from the neighbouring hills are placed so as to lean against one another and form a pent house, the bases being buried in the ground so that there are no walls to fall. The roof thus made is covered over with mud in order to give protection from the weather. The inhabitants live in these ex tremely confined tenements as best they can, but probably secure from the effects of earthquakes. An occasional shopkeeper here and there has built a shop with walls and the usual flat roof, in which to display his w'ares. By degrees old Kuchan has been deserted until at present about 200 families only now remain there. These persons mostly own lands and gardens and cannot atford to abandon them foi new Kuchan, where they would have no means of livelihood 5 occasional earthquake shocks are still felt in old Kuchan. There is a possibility that petroleum might be found if borings were made in the Kuchan valley. T/arthquakes both mild and severe have been frequent in the district, and there is plainly some cause of constant disturbance underground. In the course of conversation about earthquakes and petroleum, I was told that similar phenomena had been noticed in the neighbourhood of Baku, where so much oil has been lately discovered. Old Kuchan is surrounded with vineyards. The vines are cut down to the ground in the autumn, and the stumps covered over with earth to pre serve them from the cold of winter. When I saw them (April 23rd) they were being uncovered. Wine is made in the Kuchan district. The water supply is from the stream which flows down from the hills, past new Kuchan and eventually reaches the Caspian Sea ; also from kanats and from springs m the surrounding hills. Thanks to a plentiful water-supply in sprint the face of the whole valley is green with crops. I also noticed much cultivation which was dependent on rain. A little snow was visible on the neighbouring mountains. ' 0 ® April 24th, 1899 .—Usuabad or Tusafabad to Farij, about 10 miles. The morning was cloudy and warm. The highest mountain of the valley Shabjahan—was in view to the south. It had snow on it. I was told snow never entirely leaves it. This part of the valley is well cultivated and several villages were passed during the march. I was informed that the Shuia-ul- Dowlali had sold his rights in the villages to obtain money enough to enable him to defray the demands maae on him by the Government. Amongst the chief products are grain, and raisins. Armenian traders make advances to cultivators for the produce of the country to be exported to Asbkabad Trom tins village a track runs to Ashkabad, and another track runs to Saflabad in the opposite direction. Earij has about 100 bouses, a large karez of excellent water inns tinough it. there are vineyards in all directions. The 'rapes are grown in shallow trenches. The people, both cultivators and graziers, are Zafaranlu Kurds. The valley is about 12 miles broad. The couStrv is safe now and it has no fort, nor did X see any of the towers of refuse in the fie 1 ds so conspicuous in some parts of the country. There is plenty Sf lucerne £r, aK , and grazing for sheep. b c oa April Soth, 1899, To Davie, about 10 miles. The day was cloudy and cool. I did not pass contmuous cultivation and the road was in parts hilly and stony. The nephew of the chief of Kuchan, Mustafa Kuli Agha, sen a party out to welcome me headed by his son Zain-ul-A-ha Kaib of Ujmn There aw 6 Villases here on a stream of water from the lulls. The chief village has a large abandoned fort iu the centre Thirl is a large expanse of wheat cultivation, while the gardens contain quantities of vines grown chiefly for raisins. There is a large demand for them for the Russian market. '1 here are plenty of poplar trees, but not many apricot trees Almonds, gram, wool and cotton are exported to Russia. There is a mule 23 trnck from this village to Ashkabad which is reached ia three days. The whole valley is prosperous; cows, donkeys and ponies are to be met with at every village. On tl ie march I passed the village of Siah Dasht (about 40 families) containing the tomb of Sultan Kasim, said to be a descendant of Imam Keza. I also passed the village of Sih Gumbad containing about 50 families. In the afternoon Mustafa Kuli Agha with his two sons and a Saiyid, the brother-in-law of Mustafa Kuli, paid me a visit. Mustafa Kuli, a cousin of the Shuja-ul-Dowlah (chief of Kuchan), is head of three other villages besides Davin. April SGlh, 1890 .—To Shirwan, about 10 miles. The morning was bril liantly fine after a heavy storm on the previous day. I passed a large expanse of wheat cultivation, and got a fine view of Shirwan, our destination, from a rising ground over which the track passes called the Shntargardan. From this point there is a fine view of the Shahjahan mountain. On the way the following villages were passed : — Allahabad about ... ... ... ... BO families. Amirabad ... ... ... ... 30 „ Kishlak ... ... ... ... 50 „ Outside the town I w as met by the Knlantar of Shirwan with about 50 men. I entered by a fine gate. There is a large and high mud wall round the town not at present in a good state of repair. A considerable stream of water descends from the hills on the northern side, and on the banks is a line of villages and gardens of which Shirwan is one. I saw r the black tents of several Kurd encampments. Entering the gate follow'ed by a crow r d I rode through a bazar with about 100 shops. In the centre of the town is a hill apparently artificial, which was once the “ Ark ” (fortress), but is now ruined. I left the town by a second gate and proceeded to my camp, hard by on the bank of the nearly dry bed of the river about 50 yards wide. The w'ater of the stream is all used for irrigation. On both banks of the stream bed are vineyards and gardens. Each has a house, empty in spring, but wdien the fruit is ripening, the town becomes empty and the garden houses are filled, liaisins are chiefly grown for the Ashkabad market. A track runs along the course of the water and then branches to Ashkabad and the direction of Kizil Arvat. From this town the Russian sanitarium of Firuza is easily reached. The whole valley is prosperous. The city w r all is in a fair state of preservation, and could easily he repaired; hut, as the country is in a peaceful condition, it will probably he allowed to fall down. Haji Khan is Naib of Shirwan, and he pays the revenue to the Shuja-ul-Dowlah ; he has charge of other villages in ad dition near Shirwan. Be was away when I was there. Shirwan has about 2,000 houses and 100 shops. The principal articles of import are Russian piece-goods, sugar and kerosine oil. These come from Ashkabad via Kuchan. Indigo, tea, muslin, spices and drugs are brought from Meshed by Persian traders. There are five Armenian traders in Shirwan wdio deal in piece-goods, etc., exporting raisins and wheat to Ashkabad. Maegregor’s Gazetteer says that the town lies on the right bank of the stream, but I found it on the left hank. April 27th, 1839.—To Zuwaran, or Zuran, about 20 miles. There is a short road through the hills, but it was desirable to explore a longer road suitable for wheeled traffic. Leaving Shirwan, a small high backed bridge is passed, after which the track lies up a valley in the direction of the Shahjahan mountain. This valley w^as covered with cultivation. The villages of Tanas war, Meshed-i-Arghi and Rakzaman were passed. They contain about 50 families each. At Meshed-i-Arghi is the tomb of Sultan Muhammad Reza, said to he a descendant of Imam Reza.. Twelve families of Saiyids, descendants of the saint, live near the tomb. Leaving this point the track ascends a kotal.4 ruu *rr'f ^•'V.r.Ws cliifflv walnuts. Following the watercourse which runs^betweei^orchards'^on 'each sfde, a (Utile is entered on each hank of which »rent cliffs nearly pernerdicular, at the base' of which the stream winds. This is the list stagi in Kuchan territory. Zuaran has about 60 families, who, unaccustomed to strange rs, came out to observe us. April 28th, 1899.—To Chinaran, about 13 miles. The morning looked rainy and it was cold. Our path lay up and down a succession of hi Is entirely barren which form a fair line of demarcation between Kuchan and Bnpurd terdtory I could see large flocks and the black tents of the nomads in he distance' After some miles 1 reached a small village with a trickle of water, called Kizil Kalab (the red fort). Continuing over the barren hills the culti vation of the villa-e of Novdak was reached. This is a large village with an ample supply of water which irrigated many thousands of acres under wheat cultivation. The scenery on the way down to Chmaran was very attractive, the liuce rocks of the mountains coming down into the green wheat, the villa^of Chinaran had a fine supply of water from a spring which bursts out of the rock. It contains about tiOO houses. There is a great deal of wheat cultivation round it. Between Zuaran and Chinaran there are several tracks One of these, fit for wheeled traffic, passes by the village of Shurak, wi h about 60 families. Chinaran is in Bujnurd territory. The original village was on very high ground, but aficr the suppression of the Turkoman raids the inhabi. tants built houses lower down. T he inhabitants are Shadillu Kurds. Azizulla Be' Peshkhidmat of the Deputy Governor of Bujnurd, and Muhammad Reza Be”’ Kadkhudaof Chinaran, arrived from Bujnurd in the course of the day. They were sent hy Muhammad KuliKhan in charge of affairs at Bujnurd during fhp nVispnpfi of the chief, to accomnanv my camp. April 29th, 1899.—To Bujnurd, about 11 miles. The path lay along a well cultivated valley, the irrigation water running in channels along both sides, while a natural stream ran down the centre. This valley ended in a well culti vated plain surrounded by hills. The plain contained many orchards with the village of Ilusainabad (30 families) and a small fort called Gokkamar. Ike village of Kishlak, about 15 families, is close to Gokkamar. Thence the road runs up a sharp ascent to a dip called the Ak ICotal (the white pass).. The whole hill here is somewhat white. From the top of the pass there is an extended view. In the distance Bujnurd could be descried. I be road then led down the uncultivated hill slopes, and after several ascents and descents a point was reached where a reception party was ready to receive me, headed by Muhammad Kuli Khan, Deputy Governor of Bujnurd, Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, Postmaster, and Mirza Hadi Khan, Passport officer. Ihe party was accompanied hy a large number of sowars, a carriage, and 2 led horses. Proceeding, we soon reached an outlying village where the populace crowded out to see us, and then we came in sight of an extensive plain surrounded hy a great amphitheatre of hills in the centre of which lies Bujnurd. The town consists of the usual mass of mud huts. 'Ihe chief has built a large new house for himself with a pent house tiled roof, an unusual sight in this part of the world. The walls are a curious mixture of European and Persian styles, ornamented in parts with Persian tiles. Kext to this building, in a large garden, is a domed hath, and next this is a gateway of purely Persian architecture, covered over with ornamental Persian tiles. r lhe garden also contains a summer hou e with a domed roof. The chief was him self absent in the Goklan country, where he had gone to collect revenue, taking almost every available man with him. The wife of the chief, however, sent to say that she had got a building ready for me in a garden called Farahalza, hut as my tents were pitched 1 preferred to use them. In the evening I visited this building, passing first through a gateway with Persian tiling rather tawdry in appearance, thence the road lay through a garden; passing the town which is laid out in square form, a long avenue of poplars is reached terminatingin a garden containing a tank in which a fountain was playing. Up some steps is a summer house in the centre of which is a reservoir where a second fountain w r as playing. This place is admirably suited to the hot summer of Bujnurd. The water-supply is said to come from Giviwan, a village some farsakhs from Bujnurd to the south. Returning I rode through the town and the bazar. The latter had about 500 shops in it. There is no road for wheels from Bujnurd to Ashkabad, but the hills are in places easy, and I was told that it would not he difficult to make one. A quantity of rice is brought into Bujnurd from the Goklan country and Astrabad. Vines are plentiful every- where. The valley as a whole is very well watered from springs in the neigh bouring hills. T received visits from the Karguzar and the Deputy Governor. The Kar- guzar was formerly in a similar post at Resht. He said that every available horse had been taken by the chief to the Goklan country. 30/A, i8.9.9—Halt at Bujnurd. The Deputy Governor Muhammad Kuli Khan gave notice that he would receive me today in the afternoon at the chief’s house. On proceeding there I was taken first through a conservatory to an upper chamber well decorated with small mirror work let into the walls. Here tea was served and a small shy boy of the chief’s was introduced. I then passed through a garden plentifully watered, and by a domed building contain ing a tank for the heat of summer, into a garden, at end of which was the cheif’s “ Andarun ” into which I was invited. Here I was shown some spaci ous rooms, one of which was excellently decorated with a tiled dado, and very good mirror work, let into the walls. The ceiling was panelled with an effective glass centre. Colonel Yate recorded that the chief of Bnjnurd had told him that the Goklans were peaceful subjects and paid revenue. I found the chief absent with all the sowars he could raise to obtain revenue from them. Bujnurd is now an open town, there is no longer any necessity to fortify it, and although it is seldom visited, civilization is making its effects felt there A Russian lady had been there to endeavour to teach French to the ladies of the chief’s family, who, I was told, knew a few words The telegraph line was in working order when I was there. In the eve ning I paid a visit to the Karguzar. His home was in Uromia. He considered Bujnurd to be a little place with no work for him to do. Should a through line of communication be opened through Astrabad, Bujnurd may become an important place. It is one of the few places in Khorassan which has almost too much water; the houses in the town frequently falling owing to their foundation being sapped. Raisins are now grown in the valley for the Russian market. The people of the valley are chiefly Shadillu Kurds; Tajiks, Turks, and Zafaranlu refugees are also to he found. May 1st, 1899. —Bujnurd. Halt. With regard to certain disputes as to the water of the Atrak it was stated at Bujnurd that the Russians had destroyed certain irrigation bands which had been placed across the Atrak at Fish Kala, Mehna and Similsffian; and that they had prohibited the Persians from using the water of the river, notwithstanding that they were said to have sown seven hundred kharwars of wheat and barley seed. The Karguzar of Bujnurd said that the chief was informed by telegram from Tel:eran that an official would be deputed to settle the question. This seems to have been done, with the result that the band w as destroyed by the Persian Commissioner from Gumbadi Kabus, who is said to have proceeded to the spot with a Russian officer. There is a growing tendency on the Russian side of the boundary to consider all water &gt; flowing from Persian territory as Russian property, an encroachment against which the Persian Gcvernment is unable to protect its subj cts The appoint ment of a Russo-Persian Commission for the settlement of frontier disputes is looked upon by the people as advantageous to Russian interests and opposed to their own. May Jsf, 1899. —Halt at Bujnurd. SarJar Yar Muhammad Khan bad taken with him to the Goklan country his three grown up sons together with about 56 800 sowars Regarding the troubles between the chief and the Goklans I was informed that a personage called the “ Ishan ” (i.e., «aiyid or Mulla) had been deputed by the Goklans for the purpose of negotiations as to revenue, etc., with the Persian Government, After visiting the Governor-General at Meslied he re turned to Goklan countrv, where he met one of the officials of the chief, to whom he showed the Governor-Genenl’s orders. This official arrested the Ishan and sent him to the chief who flogged and imprisoned him. On this the Goklans appealed to the Governor-General, who obtained his release. He was directed to go to Meshed, but from Kuchan he returned to the Goklan country bv a circuitous route, where ho stirred up the Goklans against the chief. The Ishan is said to be a native of Balkh and to be a powerful Mulla and preacher. He is also reported to have lived for long in Russian territory. He has now been for some years in the Goklan country, where he has a considerable followino’ and much influence. According to the Kalantar of Shirwan the Ishan is°m Russian pay, and has at their instigation intrigued with the Goklans against the chief of Bujnurd. The Russians are also said to have promised to furnish the Goklans with arms and money. This information was obtained at Shirwan and confirmed at Bujnurd. At the latter place it was further stat ed that the Ishau before his departure to Meshed had secretly visited Ashka* bad, where he remained for 5 or 6 days. I was informed that the Sndr-i-Azam had telegraphed to the Governor-General of Khorassan to send the Ishan to Teheran. On my return to Meshed I was informed that besides the sowars the chief had taken with him to the Goklan territory, 100 sowars were sent to him at his request from Deragez, and 100 Timuri sowars were to proceed to his assistance, when a telegram was received by the Governor-General saying that the men were not wanted. The chief did not succeed in obtaining the revenue due to the Persian Government from the Goklans. May 1st, 1899. —Bujnurd. Several reports have been from time to time received regarding certain persons who were discontented with the chief of Bujnurd, and had in consequence gone to Ashkabad to complain from winch place they were induced to return. The malcontents are :— 1. Haji Sultan-uz-Zakirim, with 12 members of his family. 2. Asadulla Beg, once Deputy Governor of Bujnurd. 3. Abbas Beg, Mir Akhor. 4. Sons of Karbalai Kuli, Mir Akhor. 5.

Numbers 5, 7, 8 , 12, and 15, it is said, went to Teheran before proceeding to Ashkabad, and complained against the chief, but without result. These men are said to be of some influence in Bujnurd territory, and tbe cause of difference between them and the chief is said to be that these men were in service and were getting allowances from the chief, but the chief sus pected that they supported his late son Sulieman Khan (whom he strangled about 21 years ago) in his designs against him, and that the chief consequently turned them out from his service, confiscated their landed properties and ulti mately stopped their allowances. The malcontents tried to get the chief dis. missed, but without success, although the chief was made to pay presents to the Shah and the Governor-General of Khorassan on this account. 1 he Gover nor-General of Khorassan recently received orders from the Persian Govern ment to summon the chief to Meshed and enquire into the grievances of the malcontents. The chief, however, excused himself from coming. May 1st, 1899 .—Halt at Bujnurd. There are two Armenians and about six T™ 50 - Afghan traders in Bujnurd. The Armenians import piece-goods, sugar and kerosine oil from Shahrud, Sabzawar, and Ashkabad. The Afghans import tea and indigo from Meshed. The Armenians sometimes secretly export wheat to Ashkabad. Silk is manu factured into socks, purses and bedding ; the manufacture is not flourishing owing to the dearness of silk caused by destruction of the worms. May 2nd, 1899.—lo Firuza about 7 miles. Crossing over undulating ground we passed a succession of villages, surrounded by crops. The march was hot. Firuza village is a collection of about 150 mud huts on a hill, but the valiey is full of orchards and is as green as anything which could be found anywhere. Walnuts, apricots, pears, cherries, vines and sinjid trees grow everywhere. The vines climb some of the tallest poplars and hang about in ropes. Bujnurd is the most beautiful valley I have seen in Persia. On the way the following villages were passed :— Imamzada Sultan Abbas ... ... 60 families, f So called after J the Saint'# ... 50 j buried there.

Dagll * mountains. The villagers Of Firuza are Shahdillu Kurds, and pay revenue through the kadkhuda to the chief of Bujnurd. Supplies are plentiful here. The view from the valley of the great peaks of Akhir Kuh, Ala Dagh, Kuh Salik and Takht-i-Mirza is very fine. May 3rd, 1399 .—To Khush, about 22 miles. . The road after leav ing the gardens entered the fine defile of Darra-i-Dartum down which ran an ample stream. Cliffs of great height were passed on each side. This defile ended after about 3 miles in the open plain of Girwan; in the centre is a village built on a small hill sloping into the plain inevery direction. Altogether there are three hamlets bearing the name of Girwan or Girivvan. The three have a population of about 200 families The revenue is paid direct to the chief of Bujnurd. There was a plentiful sup ply of water from a spring, and the whole plain on which were several little hamlets was green in every direction. Thence the road or track led up a long steep ascent to a stony pass which went over the crest of the hill. This pass is known as the Kotal-bGiriwan or the Kotal-i-Siahkhana. The pass is passable for laden animals but not for wheeled traffic. Thence the track lay down a steep descent to Siahkhana where there are some springs. Thence the track passed through some bare rocky defiles where the springs lost themselves. Further on the defiles became more open and a fresh supply of water was met with, which ran down into the Isfarain plain. Notwith- standmg that it. was early in May the day was intensely hot. Further on the Isfarain plain was reached and the village of Charmaran was passed It has about 100 families. After which the village of Khush was reSd Ihis place consists of about 200 families with 4 shops including upper and lower Khush. Ihe water-supply comes from Ruin and is plentiful It has several gardens.

Insidl the S 89 the parallelogram was about 320 yards by about 150 yards. No building remained inside, but a deep dry well still exists. All the walls and towers were more or less ruined. Close to it is an enclosure of about half a square mile with the remains of many buildings. About the centre of this enclosure was once a bazar where a large number of curios and coins have been found— so much so that the right of search for them has been sold as a c on tract like everything else in Persia. Prom Bilkis I rode to Mianabad. This place is a mass of orchards and groves with a small walled village and citadel. The water-supply is very good, it flows down a river bed from the Shahjahan mountain and is led off in several irrigation channels, Kishtan and Mianabad together have at least 700 houses and about 20 shops. Supplies of all sorts are plentiful. Pive Armenians are occupied in trade at this place, importing sugar and kerosineoil from Ashkabad, and exporting thither cotton, dried fruit and raisins. These men have set up a cotton press at Mianabad. Prom Mianabad a track runs to Shirwan in the Kuchan valley. There are said to be about 100 villages in the Isfarain vallev, about 40 of which are under the chief of Bujnurd. The latter has a naib for revenue purposes at Mianabad. May 5th, 1899 .—To Ayas, about 11 miles. The road first lay through the gardens and orchards of Mianabad. I noticed several water mills. Emerging from the orchards the road crossed the plain at the base of the slopes of the Shahjahan mountain. I had seen the other side of this great mass during my march from Kuchan to Shirwan. The following villages were passed on the way : Mianabad • «« • • • ... 700 families. Kalata-i-Mulla Karim... • •• .. 70 Pastau • « . 60 » Izi • » • ... 60 )&gt; Karimabad • « • *%• ... 100 Abbasabad... • «* ,,, ... 100 Daulatabad ... 50 At the village of Pastan, Bujnurd territory ends, and at the village of Izi, I again entered Kuchan territory. 'Wheeled traffic could go anyw r here. Ayas has a water-supply from a kanat, but it only boasts about 10 families. There is less water at this part of the valley than there was at the point I entered it. It blew a severe gale at night. May 6th, 1899 .—To Bikrabad, about 13 miles. There was a cool breeze with some rain. The track passed for some miles over a plain either uncultivated or with only rain cultivation, passing the Shahjahan mountain. The range ia here called Kulingan. The first village met with was Nasrabad (about 20 families) of Baghairi Turks. Soon after this the Babasangar Ziarat came in sight in the hills to the north. To the south lay a range of hills called Ali Zaidah. To the south of this again is Jawain territory under the Governor of Sabzawar; forming the boundary of Kuchan territory. The next village reached was Dahanai Ujagt containing about 200 families of Baghairi Turks. There were many orchards. A plentiful supply of water irrigated extensive wheat fields on the lower grounds below the village. Shortly afterwards the ziarat of Saiyid Niamat Uila was reached with a small dome. There are several ruined forts about Bikrabad. The present Bikrabad has only a very few houses containing about 5 families. Prom this point a road for baggage animals runs through the hills to Kuchan. Prom Bikrabad the Baghairi valley commences, the villages of which pay revenue to the Governor of Bam who sends it to the Governor-General at Meshed. The „ Najd-ul-Saltanat, * the present Governor . Beg of js now Meshed _ Sinoe ^ was written the Najd^ubSaltanat has been appointed Wazir of Khorassan.j\l(ty 7th) 18 j 9 . To A-las, about 13 miles, lieavini, Bikrabad the road ran. almost immediately through the village of Karizdara, about 30 families of Baghairi Turks. There is a good water-supply here, and near the villao- e is a number of gardens and a great extent of cultivation. The villages of Dastgird Jahan (100 families), Ardin (60 families) and Char- mnst (10 families) of Bairhairi Turks can be seen. The track then runs across a valley and up the Bai lulls, which are crossed by the Mian Dasht Darah from the top of which the Juwain plain can be seen, to the south. Mirza Ismail Khan is the Sub-Governor of it under the Governor of Sabzawar. The path continues down these hills until Alas is reached. This little isolated hamlet contains only 8 families. 1 he morning was hot, afterwards there were thunderstorms, the men with the advance tents bad collected hailstones some of which were nearly the size of pigeons eggs. The mountain to the east of Alas is called Kul-i-Yarmunja. The Baghairi valley runs at its western extremity into the Juwain valley. May 8th, 1859.—To Dahanai Shirin, about 12 miles. The tract lay down to the Mangah plain along a dry watercourse. It then turned southwards. Ihe plam here was very hare. I passed the deserted village of Kala-i-Lutf- Ah Khan. After about G miles the village of Safiabad was reached, contain- mg about 4,00 families of Baghairi Turks, and about three shops. Between Alas and banabad there is no other cultivated place. Piece-goods, su^ar and kerosme oil are imported into Safiabad from Sabzawar about 24 miles “distant while cotton and wheat are exported via Shirwan, to which place a track runs through the hills. Safiabad is remarkable as having no trees, but there is much cultivation above and below it. Acts of oppression on the part of the fvajd-ud-Saltanat, Governor of Bam and Safiabad, are much complained of and some 50 men from Safiabad together with women from Bam had T heard gone to Meshed to complain against him. Bam is about 12 miles from Safiabad. Ihe ruin of Naoroz Tappa lies near Safiahad, and it is said that belore the reign of iNadir Shah it was a flourishing town. Dahan-i-Shirin lies about 3 miles from Safiabad close to the hills. This little village has onlv about 30 families of Baghairi Turks, but is divided into two hamlets, with a fort and gardens. The water-supply is good. There is the domed tomb of ohahzada Humza here, said to be a descendant of the Imam Beza. The morning was cool with heavy rain in the afternoon. 9lh May 1899.—To Maslikan about 12 miles. The road lay alon** an open plain slightly cultivated with rain water cultivation. Plou^hin” was going on. At a distance of about 5 miles the village of Dahan-i-Shur containing about 30 houses is passed. It has no trees. It has 40 families of Bayat Turks, i he _ water-supply is from a spring. Prom this place the Sar-i-Vilayat division of the Nishabur district commences. Thence the track runs southwards over a bare plain for about 7 miles to the village Mashkan. Ibis village has only one small garden. A road from Sabzawar to Kuclian passes through Mashkan. The former town is about 27 miles from Mashkan and the latter 36 miles. procurable ™ 11 ^ 10 ° famil!eS ° E Bayat TurI ' S ' Water from k anat.

To the east of the road from MashlJn ' Madan the following villages lie • Mashkan to Yancj Deh-i-nao Kbartu Garmab 10 20 20 15 60 families.I To the west of the road the following villages lie : Pahua ... ... ... ... 10 families. Nusk... ... ... ... ... 40 „ At a distance of about 4 miles from Mashkan is Marzan with 60 families of Bayat Turks, and a farsakh and a half further on is the fortified village of Ardelan, up to which place the track ascends the whole way. It is said that in former times Ardelan was a thickly populated place, but at present it contains only 20 families of Bayat Turks. At about half a mile further on is Haiabad, which has only 5 families. Close to Madan is Kalata-i-Hasan Ali which has 40 families. Here the Sara-i- Yilayat division of the Nishabur district ends. Near Madan I was met by the Manager of the Turquoise mines and the Naib and about 30 elders of the village of Madan, and at the camp a detach ment of Persian infantry was drawn up to receive me. In the afternoon I visited the Madan-i-Baishi in a hill overlooking Madan. Below it on the opposite side of the hill is the Abdul Bazak mine, and below it again lie the Dekud Bam and Chiragh Kush mines. 11th May 1899. —Madan. Halt. In the forenoon I visited the Madan-i- Abd-ul-Bazzaki. It lay about half a mile from the village and some 500 feet up the hill. The outside is a great cave in the rock which contains several galleries, all of which have separate names. In the afternoon Mirza Juwad Agha, the manager of Madan, Mirza Ali Naki Khan, Naib of the village of Madan, and Mirza Hasan Mustaufi paid me a visit. The Malik-ul-Tajjar of Meshed has farmed the Turquoise mines at an annual rent of 24,000 tumans for ten years. This sum includes the rent of salt mines, which are four in number, together with mill stone quarries and the village of Madan. The Malik-ul-Tajjar had the monopoly of Turquoise mines for about 12 years, but about 1891, the mines were taken from him and given to the Nusrat- ul-Mulk (the Timuri chief) and Haji Muhammad Hasan, an Afghan Banker, at an enhanced rent. But the Malik-ul-Tajjar outbid them and got the mines back again. It is this uncertainty of tenure which prevents the outlay of capital on the mines, and their improvement. The following mines are worked at present; 1. Karbalai Hasani. 2 . Baishi. 3. Mirza Ahmadi. 4. Karhalai Karimi. 5. Zaki. 6 . Thai. 7. Abdul-Bazzaki. These mines are named after the persons who worked them in former times. It is said that the best Turquoises are found in the Kalb-i-Karimi mine, but the Abdul-Razzaki also produces really good stones. Owing to no money be ing expended the mine fell in and was not worked for a long time. It is now being ■worked again. The Abdul Bazzaki mine is situated in a hill known as Kuh-i-Abu Ishaki, and near to it there are the following mines which, being filled up are not 1112 worked at present, and are considered parts of the Abdul-Eazzaki mine: 1. Rasliid-Kkani. 2 . Postini. 3. Kalantari 4. Ckilma Bandi. 5. Chihil Nafari. 6. Jehangiri. Besides the above there are other mines also which are filled up, and not worked at present. Their names are as follows : 1. Anjiri. 2 . Ardelani. 3. Ghar-i-Sabz. 4. Kamari. 5. Siah. The range of hills in which the above mines and those which are at pre sent worked are situated is known as Kuh-i-Madan. r A large sum. of money is required to clear out these mines. Hitherto contracts after being sold have been cancelled and given to higher bidders to ihe great; detrimea* of the mines. The Halik-ul-Tajjar ha? the necessary capital but will not expend it. ^ The work of mining is carried on by means of pickaxes, crowbars and blasting, the latter besides being aangerous to the labourers, spoils the turquoises in a great measure. The former tries to make as much money as ho can re- beini e injured amaS ° d ° Ue ^ The industr - v is consequently Formerly some of the mines were sub-rented to the villagers, who used to work for themselves independently of the contractor, selling the stones to deal- t . *ii contractor himself, but all the mines are at present worked by the 1 ?l 1 . k ' J Ul ' Ta ^ ar hl “ self &gt; and he has besides prohibited the sale of turquoises at Madan on penalty of severe punishment, which has caused a great rise in the value of turquoises. Still the labourers, when working in the mines steal turquoises hut cannot sell them openly at Madan, but when collected th? tur quoises are taken to Meshed, Sahzawar and Nishabur where they are sold. There are three gangs of labourers, numbering about 300 persons, who n ork m the mines day and night. The first gang works from 8 a. u. to z p m the second from 2 p. M. to 8 a. m„ and the third from 10 p. m., to 4 a m The mines are very dark and the work of mining is carried on by the light of'lamns m which country oil is used. b ^ A Aam P s The Malik-ul-Tajjar has the following establishment at the Madan: I. Mabashir, or manager of the mines. Mirza Jawad Agha. 2 . Naib, or the official in charge of the 2 hamlets of the Madan. Mirza Ali Naki Khan. 3. Mustaufi, or Accountant. —.-•.A **«&lt;• «■* U-CkA! • Zahits (watchmen) 20. Ihere is also a detachment of Persian Infantry posted at Madan A aThe turquoises are not cut or dressed at Madan, and therefore it is impos sible to value the daily or weekly outturn. It is said that about a hundred thousand tumans worth of turquoises were taken out of the mines last year. The expenditure incurred at the Madan is given as follows :— Rent of the Mines, tumans ... ... 24,000 Presents distributed to the ministers and other officials ... 6,000 Pay of the establishment and wages of the labourers ... 20,000 Total tumans ... ... ... 50,000 The balance of 50,000 tumnns includes wages of cutting and dressing stones ; charges for exporting turquoises to Europe, Russia and India and the profit of the Malik-ul-Tajjar. Only a very small number of turquoises is sold at Meshed by the Malik- ul-Tujjar, as he puts very high prices on them. Stones of superior quality are exported to Russia and other countries in Europe, and those of inferior quality are exported to India. The village of Madan has two hamlets, and the number of families living in them is estimated to be about four hundred. About three hundred persons Tvork in the turquoise mines. The natives of the Madan village are exempted from the payment of duty at the salt mines and mill stone quarries, provided they work these mines for themselves, but others are charged one kran per don key load of salt. Besides the rock mines there are mines in mounds of earth called Madan- i-Khaki. Stones of the most perfect colour and quality are found in these mines, which are far less productive as regards numbers of stones than those found in the rock mines. The Khaki mines are free from taxation. Very little cultivation is carried on at the village of Madan. The produce is insufficient for the consumption of the people. At a distance from Madan there is a lead mine in a hill, which was once worked. There are six kanatsof water at the village of Madan, supplies are procur able. The road the whole way from Mashkan to Madau is fit for wheeled traffic. 12 th May 1899 .—To Rushidabad, about 16 miles. The road ascends over several low hills until the crest is reached, whence a fine view is obtained. Below the crest are several salt mines. I inspected one. It w as a large excava tion containing rock salt. The miners were blasting it, and carrying the salt away on donkeys. Eurther on the village of Karkuchi is passed, which has only 20 families. This village has a spring of water and some rain wmter crops. Thence the road runs down the hills and then enters a narrow valley called Julou-i-Marus and immediately a stream known as the Marus which runs from the Biualud range is crossed. Near this stream to the east is a salt mine known as Kuh-i- Alidawalla and a little down the stream to the west is the village of Zung. The population of Zung is about 30 families. Eurther on a hamlet called Pur*i-Shikishta, containing 10 families is reached, and from this point the Nishabur valley commences. The first village that is reached in this valley is Hisar-i-Nao, which has GO families and further on Ibrahimabad is passed. Ibrahimabad has 40 families and is the property of the Naiyar-ul- Dowleh. Near this village a stream known as Kharas Earud which runs from the Binalud range, is crossed. Continuing on Rushidabad is reached.15 Near ITosainabnd a reception party, consisting of about 30 sowars, dressed as Persian Cossacks and headed by Sarhang SaadatKuli Khan, was met. From Hosainabad to Nishabur the following villages were passed :—* Aslikabad ... Shamsabad .. Nekab Sang-i-nao ...TOO families. ... 50 ,, ... 60 Nishabur lies on a flat plain; when approaching it from this direction no thing can he seen of the town from a distance as it is completely concealed by orchards and trees. At a distance of a mile and a half from the town the orchards and gardens of Nishabur commence. Emerging from this the high mud built wall of the town came in sight, this wall is now in excellent repair in striking contrast to the ruinous circumvallation described in books on the subject. Above the all hardly any buildings could he descried at all. I skirted the town passing by the Irak gate on the Teheran road and eventually arrived at the Robat on the Teheran road where my camp was pitched. In the afternoon I received a visit from the Muntasir-ul-Dowleh, Governor of Nishabur, a man of about 53, clean shaven and of pleasant address, and the Fath-us-Saltaneh, son of the Ivaiyir-ul-Dovvleh, late Governor of Nishabur, and a relative of the Shah’s. The son is a young man about 20 years old. They said that there is a considerable trade in grain, hut added that there wa s no road by which to export it to* Russia, as they did not wish to admit that it exported to Ashkabad. In the evening I walked to the Ark gate. The site of the former Ark (for which there is now no necessity) is occupied by a fine garden. . It had only been commenced six years previously but the soil and Avater being excellent it had grown up fast. A summer house has been built on the Avail whence a fine view of the country is obtainable. . . Uth Ma V 1899' Nishabur. Halt. At about 9-30 a. m. I returned the visits of the Muntasir-ul-Dowleh and the Fath-ul-Saltaneh. I was received in a building situated in the Ark garden where the Naiyir-ul-Dowleh was also present. In the afternoon the Naiyir-ul-Dowleh paid me a visit. Formerly the father of the present Naiyir-ul-Dowleh held the Government of Nishabur for a long time. Three years ago he died and the present Naivir- ul-Dowleh succeeded to his father’s title and the Government of Nishabur. *On his succession he commenced to oppress the people of Nishabur, who complained to the Shah and the Government Avas taken from the Naiyir-ul-Dowleh who was summoned to Teheranj where he was for about two years. During his stay at Teheran, the Government of Nishahur was held by the Bayan-us- Saltanch. Last year the Naiyir-ul-Dowleh was reinstated as Governor of Nishabur, hut he oppressed the people again, who complained to Teheran and ultimately he was dismissed and the Muntasir-ul-Dowleh, on the recommendation of the Rukn-ul-Dovvleh,was made Gevernor of Nishabur. Though the Muntasir-ul-Dowleh is Governor, still the Naiyir-ul-Dowleh exercises great authority in the town, and the district, and the former can do nothing against the will of the latter. % It is said that Armenians have been trading in Nishahur for the past 15 years, and that formerly they were three or four in number, hut gradually their number increased, and at present there are 15 Armenian traders at Nishabur. They refer their cases direct to the Governor who supports them in recovering their claims. Armenian traders import from Ashkabad, via Kuchan, piecet goods, kerosine oil, sugar, candles and other miscellaneous articles, and exportthere cotton, wheat, wool and skins. The principal article of export to Ashkahad is cotton, for which the Armenian traders pay advances to cultiva tors.^ If the advances are not repaid in cotton at the time of harvest the cultivators are compelled by the Governor either to repay the advances in cash with interest, or to give a fresh bond to supply cotton during the next season. The Naiyir-ul*Dowleh himself has a large landed property in the Nishabur district in which wheat and cotton is harvested, which he sells to the Armenians, and this is the reason that he takes the part of the Armenians against the people of Nishabur. It is said that the soil of the Nishabur district is well suited for cotton growing, which pays better than cereals and therefore the villagers are now taking to cotton growing in preference to wheat. For some years past cotton cultivation has largely increased in the Nishabur district. Besides the Armenians there are a few \ ezdi traders who import tea, indigo, spices, drugs from India via Bombay, Bandar Abbas, Yezd and Turbat-i-Haidari and export opium to China by the same route. Opium is also grown in large quantities in the Nishabur district. I inspected the caravan-sarai of Shah Abbas close to my camp. It was very strongly built. Visitors could stay there as long as they pleased rent free and it was consequently full. The present town wall has four gates called Ark’ Bagh, Irak and Meshed. I also visited the Imamzada and Muhammad Mahruk t\ icre is the grave of the poet Umar Khayum. This Imamzada is said to have been extremely old and to have been rebuilt in the time of Sultan Hussain about rfOO years ago. It lies m a garden about a mile from the present town. The Naiyir-ul-Dowleh told me that old Nishabur had once been there. Enterin' I oun myself at the entrance of a terraced garden, containing a tiled dome°at the end of a short vista. The tiling was being repaired by the Naiyir-ul-Dowleh with tiles brought from Meshed. The central arch has smaller arches on each side. M hen facing the facade the left arch contains a ruined tomb the grave of the famous Umar Khayum. ^ Iie Naiyir-ul-Dowleh said that there had been an engraved stone, but it had been removed. When returning the visits I received I entered a covered bazar. Ihe Naiyir-ul-Howleh is a pleasant man of about 60, slight, rather small ando pol,shed manners. He had accompanied the Shah on hfs journeys. He said the cultivation of Nishabur had been much on the increase of late years Sg withRussia ^ t ' 10ushttlle Amirof Afghanistan had a secret understand- ffa. f Daishai Mohumadabad Do.

They pay no revenue or sheep tax to the Persian Government and have been, they say, exempted from the time of Shah Abbas. There is a fine garden at this place with (for Persia) some handsome pine and other trees. There is a caravan-sarai, also a post house. Outside the garden is a shady spot occupied chiefly by pilgrims. Entrance to the garden is gained by an arched gate. There is a tank of excellent water inside. The garden is densely shaded. At the end of a short avenue is a domed mosque now under repairs. There is a black stone set in a wall of the dome bearing foot marks which are said to be of the Imam Reza. The stone is held sacred especially by Shias, who come for the pilgrimage in large numbers. Many stories are told about the stone, but they differ from each other. The walls were covered in parts with fine tiles. The tiles from the dome had gone, but much of the rest is in a fair state of repair. The Kadamgah fort is perched on an eminence overlooking the tomb and garden. The village lies partly inside and partly outside. There is a water- supply from the hill. Opposite this fort, on a hill, there is a fortress now ruined which in former times was the original site of the village of Kadamgah, but it is said that about 200 years ago, it was ransacked by the Uzbegs who seized a large number of Saiyid families and deported them to Bokhara where their descendants are still said to be found. The stream of water which runs from the Kuh-i-Darrud and the water of a kanat are both included in the endowment of the shrine at Kadamgah. The road from Nishabur to Kadamgah is fit for wheeled traffic. Supplies are procurable. 16th May 18^.—Kadamgah. Halt. I found Kadamgah very windy. 17th May 1899. —Kadamgah. Halt. 18th May 1899.—Fakhr-i-Baud, about 16 miles. At a distance of about 4'miles from Kadamgah I reached the village of Baghshan, which has 60 families and several gardens. It has water from a kanat as well as from a spring. At Baghshan is the tomb of Sultan Saiyid Habib, said to be a descendent of the Imam Reza. Further on is Mushan with 100 families, and aside from the road under the foot of a hill is Dizbad which is the last village on the Meshed side of the Nishabur district. At a little distance from Dizbad is Kala-i-Kuri with 20 families, and further on is Kalata-i-Shurabi which has only 2 familiesFakhr-i-Daud has 15 families and a carvan-sarai said to have been built by Shah Abbas the great. The position is very exposed and there is generally a tearing wind. 'Ihe sarai is strongly built. It is covered in with domes. Alcoves at the sides have a high dais for visitors. There is also a high dais in the centre, while the passage between is occupied by animals. Supplies are procurable. The water-supply is from a kanat. The mountain east of Fakhr-i- Daud is called Kuh-i-Kajkari. The road is fit for wheeled traffic. 19th May 1899 .—To Sharifabad, about 18 miles. The road leads over hills stony and bare with little to diversify the route. Kala-i-Safidar which has l5 families is passed. There is no other populated place on the road between Fakhr-i-Daud and Sharifabad. The mountain east of Safidar is called Kuh-i-Paiwand. There are two caravan-sarais at Sharifabad, one of which is very large and has winter and summer quarters. It was built by Isa Khan, Karai, and a kanat of water is also endowed by Isa Khan for its repairs, but the caravan-sarai is neglected and is in a bad state of repair. It is a very strong place. The other caravan-sarai was built by the late Amir Husain Khan, Shahab-ul-Mulk, father of the Asaf-ul-Dowleh, who was Gevernor-General of Khorassan before the Rukn-ul-Dowleh. The water- supply is from 2 kanats. Population numbers about 100 families. Supplies are procurable. 20 th May 1899—^0 Meshed, 22 miles. The road after leaving Sharifabad to Turuk passes up a sharp ascent, and at some places dangerous to wheeled traffic. This is the most difficult part of the road for carriages between Meshed and Teheran. Prom a considerable distance Turuk and Meshed could be descried on the plains. At Turuk is a fine stream of water divided into several irrigation channels, with a caravan-sarai. An attempt not very successful has been made to plant an avenue of trees. Thence a fair road descends into Meshed. H. M. TEMPLE, Lieut.-Colonel, Agent to the Governor General of India and Iler Britannic Majesty's Consul General for Khorassan and Seistan.1 / I B. F. Diary No. 107-F. No. 103, dated Meshed, the 24th June 1899. From— Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Temple, Agent to the Governor-General of India and Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan and Seistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 88 -A., dated the 31st May 1899, I have the honour to forward a copy of Despatch No. 8 , Political, dated the 1 st June 1899, from Captain Sykes to the address of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2. In the concluding paragraph of this despatch Captain Sykes says, “ I would venture to express my final opinion that, at present, if we can avoid having a Consul for Kain and Seistan (the post should, if founded, include Tun and Tabas, as being under the Governor of Seistan), it would be advisable to do so.” As plague has now broken out at Bushire, I venture to think that a medical officer would be preferable to a Consul in Seistan. So far the Russian Government have not appointed a Consul though it was rumoured they would do so. It may be that they will not appoint one if, as recommended by Captain Sykes, the post should not be maintained by us. If, however, this post is maintained the Russian Government would probably be obliged to appoint a Consul as a counterbalance. The plague which has appeared in the Persian Gulf may remain there for years. It is not unlikely that the Russian Government may endeavour to establish quarantine in Southern Khorassan to prevent plague from entering Russian territory. They do not desire quarantine on the northern border of Khorassan, because if they closed the boundary between Persia and Trans Caspia, they might have much difficulty in supplying their troops in Trans Caspia. Supplies for these troops are drawn from 'Northern Khorassan. If the Russians establish quarantine through their doctors in Southern Khorassan they will gain a preponderating advantage in Khorassan and Seistan. I would therefore beg to recommend that a medical officer should be sent in place of Captain Sykes and that this officer should be the Assistant of the Consul-General at Meshed. The political work which is now performed by Captain Sykes could be disposed of by this medical officer. 3. Should the post of Consul in Seistan be maintained, Captain Sykes is of opinion that “ if the Russian Consul be independent of Meshed, so ought his British colleague to be.” With regard to this, I would observe that there is no adequate reason in my opinion why an independent Consulate should be estab lished is Seistan. WTietherthe Russian Government will establish a Consulate in Seistan at all, and, if so, whether, it will be independent or not, remains to be seen. I would venture to hope that this Consulate-General may remain intact as it is, and would very strongly deprecate any change being made, such as the formation of an independent Consulate in the southern portion of it. As it is the Consulate-General comprises the same area as the Persian Governor- Generalship. The native Government has found that as a matter of experience it is convenient to place Khorassan and Seistan under one administration. 4. If it he decided to send the medical officer I have proposed instead of a consular officer to Seistan, it would, I think, be necessary to place tw'o subordinates under him for the establishment of plague observation posts. These subordinates might also be placed in charge of the postal arrangements between Birjand and the frontier of Baluchistan. No. 8 -Political, dated Birjand, the 1st June 1899. From— Captain P. Molesworth Sykes, To—The Right Honourable the Marquess of Salisbury, K. G. In continuation of my No. 7 of thellth May 1899, I now have much pleasure in being able to report a most satisfactory state of affairs.Early in May, the Acting Consul-General at Meshed informed me that M. de Stroeff, the Dragoman of the Eussian Consulate, was about to start for Birjand with presents to the value of fourteen hundred pounds for the Amir of Kain and his young brother, not the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and, as it was expected that Cossacks would accompany him, I was advised to leave Birjand before his arrival, in order to avoid friction between the escorts. The Amir was much perturbed at learning that valuable presents were be ing sent him in so ostentatious a manner, as he feared a trap. He considered that if “ the poor Russians,” to use his own expression, sent him such gifts, they must want something big in return. In fact his frame of mind at once suggested the well-known line—“ Tuneo Danaosbt dona ferentes”. In the meanwhile, I h had fully explained to the Amir’s Vizier the objects of my visit and apparently I had gained his confidence, as my advice on the subject was asked for. I pointed out that Great Britain was setting a limit to Eussian aggression in China, and hinted that, in all probability, this w r as the reason of their renewed activity in Eastern Persia. The Vizier told me that the Amir, at first, had intended not to receive the presents, as he keenly resented the obvious attempt to buy him, but that he had finally decided to accept them and show by his manner that they were unwelcome. As may be imagined, I quite agreed with this course of action. • I was, most fortunately, unable to engage transport until the Passion plays were terminated, no Persian being willing to start on a journey during this period ; and my advance camp actually started the same daythatM.de Stroeff arrived. As he had only a single Eussian Cossack with him and had altogether a party less than half the size of mine, his arrival produced but little effect, although, like myself, lie was meet by the Amir’s brother. In my last despatch, I laid great emphasis on the fact that the Amir had called first on me as, in the East, that question is of premier importance so I imagined that the same procedure would be adopted in the case of Russia’s representative, especially as I had heard that the Eussian Consul-General had particularly asked that this should be done. However, no such honour was shown to M. de Stroetf who, two days after bis arrival, called on the Amir to present the Emperor’s gifts. ' ’ .

This is not the case at any rate, as yet, but being a shrewd man, he sees that our policy is open, reasonable and natural, while he now profoundly mis trusts Russia. The net result is that he is cordial towards us, settling my few cases with commendable promptitude. To temporarily quit the subject, the trade of the district, as regards bulk is mainly with Russia, but although the roughest statistics are unobtain able, I think that, as regards value, fully one half of the trade comes from the south, so that Birjand is certainly not to be considered as being in the Russian zone of influence. From the political point of view, moreover, we must not lose sight of the fact that Kain is the first healthy distinct west of Quetta, so that, in case of a division of Persia , which can hardly be deemed to be outside the range of dis cussion, we must hold part, at any rate, of the province of Kain, both for the reason given above and in order not to uncover Farrah, which appears to be a most important stratigical point. In conclusion, I would venture to express my final opinion that, at present, if we can avoid having a Consul for Kain and Seistan (the post should, if founded, include Tun and Tabas, as being under the Governor of Seistan), it would be advisable to do so, as both our political and commercial interests can be suffi ciently well guarded by an occasional tour from Meshed, where there is both a Consul-General and a Consul, or from Kerman, while the news-writing post masters, whose appointment I consider essential, could keep the authorities informed of what was happening in Seistan and Kain. If, however, as appears to be the case, owing to Russian action, we are forced to establish a British Consulate, such a post should be founded on the same terms as the Russian one. By this I mean, that both the salary, appointments and the question of escort, should be considered in the light of what our rival did ; as a natural sequence, if the Russian Consul be independent of Meshed, so ought his British colleague to be, although, otherwise, the post, in my humble opinion, should be under Meshed and in some ways, it would be more advantageously filled by an officer of the Indian Political service, who would thereby connect Meshed and Quetta.W. ■ , ,No 141-A., dated Meshed, the 4th August 1899.

With reference to my letter to the Government of India No. 103, dated June 34th, 1899, I have the honour to forward a letter No. 6, dated 7th July, from Captain Sykes addressed to you, sent under flying seal to me, on the subject of the limits of his consular district, and to enclose at the same time a memorandum which I have drawn up as to the circumstances which led to the appointment of Cap tain Sykes to Seistan and Kain. 2. Captain Sykes requests that the province of Kain may be included in his consular district; observing that his political despatches of this year would prove the necessity for this. In paragraph 5 of the enclosed memorandum I have noticed the observations made by Captain Sykes on this subject. If a consular officer is to be retained permanently in the South of this Consulate General he cannot re main all the year round in Seistan. The climate forbids it. In view of this and of the expected establishment of a Russian Consulate in Seistan, and of other con siderations l was in the first place of opinion that Captain Sykes should proceed to the hills near Seistan or Birjand. This was done and while I was on tour in Northern Khorassan Captain Whyte, who was in charge of my office during my absence from head-quarters, referred to the Minister at Tehran the question * as •Telegram No. ifi, dated nth April 1899. ^ whether Captain S^-kes should be styled Telegram No. 14, dated 13th A P ni 1899. Consul for Kain, and receiving a reply in Letter No. 47-A., dated 15th Apni 1S99. ^ a ffi rma Hve he has been so styled ac cordingly. 3. Captain Sykes also recommends that the districts of Tun and Tabas should be included in his consulate ; because they are ruled by the Hashmat-ul- Mulk who is Governor of Seistan. With respect to this I would beg to explain that Seistan and Kain were formerly included in one Governorship, when the last Governor died, the Governorship was divided, Seistan falling to the share of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and Kain (Birjand) to the share of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Tun and Tabas w ? ere formely under the Government of Mirza Muhammad Bakir Khan (Imad-ul-Mulk). When he died in 1894 he left three sons, the eldesi of whom succeeded to his father’s title and the Governorship of Tabas. Sub sequently he was ousted and his younger brother succeeded him. He also was dismissed and the Hashmat-uNMulk (in addition to the Governorship of Seistan) obtained the Governorship of Tabas on the presentation of a large present to the Shah’s Government. After having been ousted twice by the eldest son, and once by the second son, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk vms reinstat ed last year in the Governorship of Tabas. According to MacGregor’s Gazet teer the Governorship was hereditary. It is no longer so as the Hashmat- ul-Mulk is not the next heir. Tun and Tabas are not connected with the Seistan District in any way, they are not even very near it, but the Hashmat-ul-Mulk probably out-bid others for the post. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has married the grand daughter of the late chief. Captain Sykes says that “Tun and Tabas are ruled by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Seistan, and as it appears that the arrangement owing to his intermarriage with the broken down ruling family is J| \ fipermanent, it would perhaps be advantageous that these districts should be placed under my charge.” Captain Sykes’ letter dismisses the case in a few words. I cannot agree with him in thinking that the arrangement is permanent. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk has ousted the heirs and been three times ousted himself since 1894. This does not seem to me to point to the permanency of the arrangement. On the contrary it seems to me that a change might take place at anytime. There is, however, another objection to the inclusion of Tabas and Tun in a Seistan and Kain con sulate, The labas district extends up to Amrani. Mowla 'Buksh’s report.* page • Dated 7 th April to 28th July 1898. Ji, shows that Amrani is exactly half way between Meshed and Birjand, Captain Sykes’ proposals contemplate the establishment of a Seistan consulate including Tabas in the first place, and the making it into an independent consulate after wards, to be included in Kirman, etc. A glance at the map will show that this plan would reduce this consulate-general by about a third, while the Kirman- t Persian Baluchistan. Baluchistanf charge would already seem to be very large. Under these circumstances I would altogether deprecate the acceptance of Captain Sykes’ proposals. Tabas a,.d I un should not, I think, therefore, be included in that consulate 4. In addition to this Captain Sykes’ Consular jurisdiction includes, to use his words, the whole of eastern and south-eastern Persia, ” i.e. } Kirman and ersian Baluchistan.. For Seistan he recommends that news-agents be appointed. Un my recommendations a Hospital Assistant has been appointed for Seistan, and a so one for Birjand. As these men can also look after the post, and write news letters, beistan and Kain are arranged for in this respect. 5. For Kirman Captain Sykes asks for a w r ell paid agent, as he has to rely on a protected merchant for news, while for Persian Baluchistan he has no agent at a , and British interests suffer there proportionately. I venture to think that Captain Sykes has already more than sufficient to employ him in Kirman and Persian Baluchistan without the addition of Kain and Seistan R v'k r S re ^ ds Seistan a ^d Kain Captain Sykes says that the position of the British Consul must to a certain extent depend on what line Russia adopts. should do the sameT eS her “ Consul IIlde P enden t Meshed perhaps we am quite unable to say what Russia will do as to the appointment of a SeisTan'if kTad’nnff 31 ’' n0t ^ reccommend e d an officer at all for beistan, if it had not been repeatedly rumoured that the Russian Gove-nment were about to establish a consulate there ; more than a year has now elapsed and the fentM n ^StioeffT n °u f P 0 ‘ nt ? d a ' officer ' The Russian Consul-General a consulate 5 'a a 3 ' 1 W ' th P resents &gt; bu t he was not to establish consulate If they had intended to establish a consulate there shnrtlv I HifeTnffi 0 thmk A lke y that , !: h ? presents would have been sent with the accre- ted officer, and the return of their officer after presenting the mfts points I think on! he Rus f atTMeshed. 31 !'on'tUoccasmn 6 asted^k^ ^ Rassian Consulaifcenerai dent.

The argument adduced by Captain Sykes is that the trade route passes through both districts rom _andar Abbas. This trade route runs to Meshed and beyond, and if Captain v y es argument is applicable, the whole of Eastern Persia from the Russian rentier to the Sea should be included in one Consulate-General. . 7 ' ^ or ,j e , r t0 wor ^ his.district Captain Sykes urges that it is essential a . e s ould have a well paid agent at Kirman.

Seistan however, is in this Consulate General, and it does not appear to me advisable to continue the present arrangement according to which Captain Sykes is under me as regards Seistan and independent of me with respect to everything else. With respect to Seistan he corresponds direct with the Secretary of State for Foreign Anairs.

From—P. Molesworth Sykes, To—Sir Mortimer Durand, K.C.S.I., etc. . In accordance with your instructions that I should limits of my consular district, I would venture to request thatohe t0 ‘4 Kain form a portion of it, as at the present time q ' 1 th province ofMy political despaches of this year will, I think, prove the necessity for this, so that I need not again refer to the question. I would, in the next place, beg to point out that the d ' st ' cl j s ar '^ Tabas are ruled by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Seistan and as it appears that the arrangement owing to his intermarriage w ' th a ^ e family is permanent, it would perhaps be advan a^eou should also be placed under my charge. At the same time, in order to work these districts which include the whole of eastern and south-eastern Persia, yt is essentia or • i j M asrata u a J agent at Kirman and also news-writing post masters at Birjand and NasraUbad (Seistan). The latter I have already applied for and they might, it would appear, be Hospital Assistants, with great advantage, as medical assistance is appreciated in Eastern Persia in a most extraordinary way, and a Hospital Assistant should experience no difficulty in gaining the most reliable information, whereas other agents would be treated with coldness or suspicions. At Kirman, a protected merchant keeps me informed of what goes on, and fortunately the Governor-General is well disposed ; but, at best the arrangement is but a poor makeshift, being all I can do in the total absence of funds. In Persian Baluchistan, I have no agent whatever, which is, I think, a great pity especially as our interests in that province are increasing year b\ year. In this connection, it is not unlikely that, had my suggestion been accepted the murder of Mr. Graves would not have taken place, as the Karwanis would have known that w r e had an agent at Bampur. The Indo-European Telegraph Department when I broached the subject, some two years ago, offered 'to contribute Rs. 50 per mensem towards this appointment, but at that date my proposal was not supported sufficiently for it to be sanctioned. Since my arrival at Birjand, some of the frontier chiefs have written to me through the thanadar at Robat Kuh-i-Malik-Siah, and it is of importance to noi.e both that the Quetta-Seistan route officials have dealings with the Chiefs in Persian Baluchistan, the road skirting their frontier for several stages, and also that, at Birjand, I am more in touch with this section of the frontier than at Kirman, although as regards other sections the converse holds good. In my political despatches I have suggested that the position of the British Consul must, to a certain extent, depend upon what line Russia adopts. It is hardly to be questioned that the Consulate-General at Meshed gains both in position and in usefulness by having a consular officer under its orders, who can be sent to any portion of the three southern districts of Khorassan, but at the same time, if Russia makes her Consul independent of Meshed, perhaps we should do the same, although, as the telegraph is first struck at that city, there does not appear to be any urgent necessity for adopting this course. In conclusion, I would venture to urge that, at any rate, so long as there is plague in Persia, a British Medical officer, if possible with a taste for botany or natural history, be attached to me as, apart from the immense value of his pro fessional work, by adopting such a course, Russia would have less reason for interference; while 1 should no longer be absolutely alone. Seconnly, the permanent establishment of the post is of the greatest impor tance ; and, finally, an escort and a surveyor are indespensible, if the fullest use is to be made of my appointment.

In despatch No. 2, dated 17th January 1899, Captain Sykes wrote that he was of opinion that “ our interests do not, at present, require more than the presence of a Political Officer, as during the summer all trade ceases and there would be little of nothing to do.” In his despatch No. 3, dated 1st February 1899, Captain Sykes argued that Kirman and Seistan should be placed under one Consul, but he at the same time said that “ only the occasional visit of a political officer is required under present circumstances.” With reference to Kirman and Seistan being placed ♦•No. a3-A., dated the 18th February 1899. under one Consul, I pointed out** that this . was opposed to the opinion of Colonel Yate, who asked for an Assistant to the Agent to the Governor-General for Kain and Seistan, that Kain and Seistan were separated by the desert from Kirman and were politically under the Governor General for Khorassan who had no authority in Kirman. Kain and Seistan are, moreover, not connected by the post with Kirman, whereas they are connected by a weekly post with Meshed, under existing arrangements. 5. With respect to the steps which Russia was expected to take, Captain tt No. 3, dated the 1st February 1899. Sykes pointed out ff ‘that given the , importance of Birjand no Consular Officer will permanently live in Seistan.” In despatch No. 4,}} Captain Sykes urged that Xt Dated 14th February 1899. 1 lt ^ influen Ce should , . . l L o • be establlshed m Birjand. I have mention- ed m a previous despatch that Seistan looks to Birjand for both its garrisonand the greater part of its officials so that to leave its ruler in the toils of Russian fntrigues would appear to be an inadmissible course especially as all orientals are changeable to a degree.” In despatch No. 6 • Captain Sykes observed that “ Russia would in my r . 0 humble opinion be wasting money if an • ,8th Apni ,859. official was appointed for Seistan only. If, however, he were to receive his exequator for Chain (Birjand) as well as for the . Seistan delta province f he could perhaps be of greater value to Russia.” In conclusion I would venture to repeat that at present there is little or no Consular work at Nasratabad, not a single case of any importance having been brought before me, and it rather strikes me that perhaps Russia has found out that there is no trade and has therefore delayed sending a representative. As matters now stand, if a suitable agent be established and the post be continued, an occasional visit from a Political Officer is all that is required, especially as I can now trust any small case that may occur to the good offices of the Deputy Governor. In despatch No. 7 { Captain Sykes said : “ I do not see any reason to alter _ . .. q my opinion that merely an occasional visit J Dated 31st May 1899. , J U • i /-me £ ‘ C D by a Political Officer of experience of Persia is necessary unless Russia found a Consular post in these districts.” 6 In the meantime M. de Stroeff, the Dragoman of the Russian Consulate General at Meshed, left for Birjand on a mission to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, on the 11th of May 1899, with presents to the extentofTumans 7,000 for the Shaukat-ul- 0 Mulk from the Russian Government. It eegram, ae 19 a y , 99. was anticipated § that the establishment of a Russian Consulate might be entrusted to him. It was also reported that a senior officer had been chosen for the post, and that he might reach Meshed about June 10th. Nothing further has, however, been heard of him up to date. M. de Stroeff stayed only a short time in Birjand and then returned to Meshed. In reporting on his Mission Captain Sykes wrote : “ I would venture to express mv final opinion that at present if we can avoid having a Consul for Kain and Seistan (the post should include Tun and Tabas as being under the Governor of Seistan) it would be advisable to do so, as both our position and commercial interests can be guarded by an occasional tour from Meshed where there is both a Consul and a Consul General.” Whether the Russian Government will establish a Consulate in Seistan or Kain it is impossible to say; but if they intend to do so, I do not understand why they did not send the presents for the Shaukat-ul-Mulk with the new Consul. Their having sent the gifts and withdrawn the officer who took them, points to the conclusion that a Russian Consulate will not be established thereat present. 7. Early in June plague broke out in Bushire. In consequence of this, pilgrims started from that place for Meshed, and information was received that Russian doctors had been sent to Shiraz and Kirman. In view of these occur rences and of the fact that Captain Sykes was opposed to the establishment of a Consulate in Seistan which might compel the Russians to establish one to counterbalance it, I urged || that a Medi cal Officer would be preferable to a Consu lar Officer both for the political work in Seistan and Kain and for medical duties ; I also recommended that he should have two subordinates under him for plague observation posts. One Hospital Assistant is with Captain Sykes now, and a second is on his way to Seistan ; with a Controlling Medical Officer in Birjand in summer and Seistan in winter plague observation posts could be easily established.

C. Press, Simla.—N . 549 F- D.—S 9-99-~45-From C. E. PITMAN, Esq., C.I.E., Director General of Telegraphs t To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, Public Works Department. Simla, the nth August i8gg. Sir, With reference to your letter No. 598-C. W. T., dated the 22nd of October 1898, I have the honour to report that Mr. H. A. Armstrong, Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs, Class VI, grade 2nd, was instructed to examine the country between Quetta and the Persian frontier and report on the possibility and cost of erecting a line of telegraph from Quetta to Ladis and Koh-i-Malik Siah. 2. Mr. Armstrong in company with Lieutenant Webb Ware left Quetta on the 20th November 1898 and returned on the 17th March 1899, and I now for ward 35 copies of his very useful and interesting report which, for the sake of convenience, is divided into the following sections :— (I) Quetta to Amir Chah ... (II) Amir Chah to Ladis (III) Amir Chah to Koh-i-Malik Siah (IV) Ladis to Koh-i-Malik Siah 359 Miles 85 116 7b A line of telegraph from Quetta to Koh-i-Malik Siah md Amir Chah and Ladis would be 520 miles long j while the length of a line taken to Ladis Amir Chah and Koh-i-Malik Siah would be 551 miles long; and that of a line to Koh-i-Malik Siah vid Amir Chah would be 475 miles. Section (/).—Quetta to Amir Chah 359 miles, country open, stony and sandy as a rule, sparse population and cultivation, water scarce and often bad, no supplies except near Nushki, heat intense in summer, several miles of sand-hills to be crossed. Trade very slight. Section (//).—Amir Chah to Ladis 85 miles, country pretty much the same as in section I. There is no recognized track. Heavy sand-hills are passed through for 7 miles, water very scarce and bad and not met with for 43 miles in one place. No supplies. Country a desert. Section {IIP ).—Amir Chah to Koh-i-Malik Siah 116 miles, country as above only worse, some 9 miles of sand-hills to be crossed some of which are from 40 to 200 feet high.■■ 2 Section (/f^.-Koh-i*Malik Slab to Ladis 76 miles, country though stony and barren is better as there are no sand-hills ; and water is more abundant. 3. From the description of the country it will be seen that it would be most difficult and costly to construct and maintain a line of telegraph along the above routes, and considerable detours would probably be necessary to avoid the sand hills, assuming that this could be done. The most serious obstacle is the sand, though the absence of water for long distances is almost as grave a difficulty. Mr. Armstrong recommends (para graph 7 of report) rubble foundations varying from 144 to 600 cubic feet according to the nature of the sand, but I am very doubtful if his proposals are practicable. 4. I also forward estimates of the cost of constructing a line from Quetta via Amir Chah to Ladis and from the latter place to Kohu-Malik Siah, miles 520, and of an alternative line from Quetta vid Amir Chah to Koh-i-Malik Siah and thence to Ladis 551 miles hereafter described as routes “ B ” and “A” respectively. These estimates which amount to Rs. 11,32,600 and Rs. 12,71,200, respectively, indicate what a costly scheme it is. 5. If it be decided not to extend the line from Ladis to Koh-i-Malik Siah or vice versa the cost of the line from Quetta to Amir Chah and thence to Ladis would amount to Rs. 9,29,700 only. Either line would not only be a very expensive one to construct, but the cost of maintenance would be very heavy as, on account of the great scarcity of water, food, labour and transport, special arrangements would be necessary. A staff of coolies and riding camels, which would have to be bought at a cost of Rs. 2,160, would have to be maintained and provision made for medical aid, and it is calculated that including interest, depreciation and ordinary line maintenance and interest, depreciation and main tenance on the cost of first fitting of offices, vi3. } Rs. 3,740, the annual charges for the two lines “ B ” and A, ” respectively, would amount to Rs. 1,02,130 and 1,15,77° to which should be added an annual charge of Rs. 28,680 on account of the line and office establishments that it would be necessary to maintain at the terminal and intermediate offices and stations on each route. Four offices includ ing quarters for servants and line establishment for observation and maintenance purposes would have to be built at Nushki, Dalbandin, Amir Chah and Ladis or Koh-i-Malik Siah at an aggregate cost of Rs. 71,000 and 7 rest houses for the line staff at a total cost of Rs. i,8oo so that the total capital outlay on the line and offices would amount to Rs. 12,11,30c and Rs. 13,49,900 respectively. 6. If in case of route B, however, the line is sanctioned only up to Ladis, then the annual charge for interest, depreciation and ordinary maintenance including the upkeep of permanent coolies and riding camels would amount to R s - 8L353 to which should be added an annual charge of Rs. 21,840 on account of line and office establishments. Three offices would have to be built at an aggregate cost of Rs. 48,000 and 6 rest houses at a total cost of Rs. 1,500. The total capital outlay on line and offices would amount to Rs. 9,83,965. 7. Traffic may be taken as practically nil. All trade is transit, and it is very doubtful if any appreciable telegraph revenue would be obtained from the Kafilahs. 8. I would invite special attention to paragraphs 7, 8, g and 12 of the3 2 report in which Mr. Armstrong deals with the difficulties to be encountered as regards sand, water-supplies and climate respectively. 9. Mr. Armstrong in the final (13th) paragraph of his report sums up strongly against the proposed route for various reasons, and I cannot but concur in his opinion. I would, however, remark that if the construction of such a line is considered an absolute necessity, it should be possible to construct and maintain it but only at an enormous cost. 10. As regards stores it would be necessary to obtain from England 10,000 B. C. Posts, i,6co miles of wire, 32,000 Insulators and 20,000 Brackets for which special prevision of funds would have to be made. n. The only justification for adopting such a difficult route would be the necessity for establishing a telegraph line for local requirements which, in my opinion, do not exist. There is no local trade and not likely to be any. 12. The route is flanked by Afghanistan aknost throughout its entire length, and in the event of the southern portion of that country becoming acces sible to us by treaty or conquest, the proposed line would become a veritable white elephant as the little trade now traversing Seistan would almost certainly be diverted to the old established route via Kandahar and Girishk. 13. As regards the routes traversed by Mr. W. King Wood, Assistant Superin tendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, (a copy of whose report I enclose) in the vicinity of the Persian frontier, he unhesitatingly condemns them as unsuitable stating he considers “ all three as inadvisable, difficult, expensive and unsuitable in every way, at the present time, for the construction, mainte nance and ultimate success of an international telegraph line.” 14. Mr. Wood favours a line from Ispahan or Kashan (about midway bet ween Ispahan and Teheran) via Yezd, Kerman, Bam, Regan and Pahra from which place to Karachi he advises a survey being made via Magas, Kuhak and Lus Beyla as he believes such a route would be found satisfactory. The route from Pahra to Gwadur via Serbaz which he traversed he does not recom mend as being difficult and the country unsettled. 15. In conclusion I would remark that after studying the reports of Messrs. Armstrong and Wood, I am of opinion an endeavour should be made to con struct the alternative line from Karachi running in a general North-West direction towards Ispahan or some suitable point between that place and Teheran, and that while I believe the construction and maintenance of a line of telegraph from Quetta to Kerman via Ladis within the bounds of possibility, the great cost of such a line would not justify its being undertaken. 16. I also forward six photographs of the country traversed and would remark, in conclusion, that the submission of the report has been delayed by the preparation of detailed estimates and of the drawings and photographs which form accompaniments. 17. The expenditure incurred in connection with Mr. Armstrong’s deputa tion to Ladis and Koh-i-Malik Siah amounts to Rs. 5,684-0-4 as detailed in the statement attached hereto, and instructions regarding the head of account under which the amount should be finally adjusted in the accounts for 1898-99 are requested. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, C. E. PITMAN, Director General of Telegraphs.CONFIDENTIAL.

A. Armstrong, Assistant Superin tendent of Telegraphs. 1. The following is a report on the possibility and cost of constructing a Telegraph line from Quetta to Ladis and Koh-i-Malik Siah. Ihe accompanying estimates of the cost are in 4 parts :— Part I. From Quetta to Amir Chah, 359 miles. Part II.—From Amir Chah to Ladis, 85 miles. Part III.—From Amir Chah to Koh-i-Malik Siah, 116 miles. Part IV.—From Koh-i-Malik Siah to Ladis, 76 miles. These estimates have been prepared in accordance with the directions con tained in letter No. 1587, dated the 28th October 1898, from the Director General of Telegraphs to the Superintendent, Sind and Baluchistan Division, and sup plemented afterwards by directions conveyed in telegrams of 88 words dated 34 th March 1899, and 57 words dated 1st April 1899, from the Superintendent, Sind and Baluchistan Division, to me. The total cost of the line for whatever route is selected on can be obtained by adding together the totals of cost in the different Parts I, II, III, IV plus the cost for buildings as estimated for in Statements I and II attached. 2. The proposed routes for the line are traced in red ink in the accompany ing maps, the westerly tracts verging on the Persian frontier 6hewn on these are sketchy, and should not be relied on for accuracy ; the country has recently been resurveyed, and fresh maps will no doubt be published at an early date. 30. In estimate Part I the line recommended will follow closely the trade route from Quetta to Koh-i-Malik Siah. Statement Estimate Part I. jjj attac j iec i ^\\\ g\ ve particulars of the various halt ing places, with the water and other supplies obtainable at them. This route from Quetta leads along the main road as far as Samanguli, 6^ miles ; from here a well defined track leads off to the left, and bends in a south westerly direction round the lower slopes of Chihiltan mountain; at the 16th mile is Girdi Talab or sometimes called Girdi Bagh, the first halting place; here there is an abundant supply of good water from an open karez ; Bhusa can be procured in small quantities from the few inhabitants who live in a small hamlet close by. from Girdi Talab the track ascends for about 6 miles through an open valley with low hills on either side, then descends gradually for 8 miles; at the 34th mile is Kanak village ; here the country opens out into a broad plain, u r ell cultivated, supplies are procurable from banias in the village, there is an excellent spring of water from a rock outside a small ancient tort. The inhabi tants of Kanak are mostly Raisanis, altogether about 3,000 in number. . From Kanak the track leads on in a south south-west direction over a cultivated plain, and at the 37th mile passes the small village Soru to the west; at the 39 ^ mile crosses the Shorarud river, about 80 yards in width, with high banks ; the water in this is usually about 2 feet deep, and slightly salt. At the 42nd mile the track enters the Khurd Barack Pass, and continues on for 2 or 3 miles through a small range of hills ; this pass presents no difficulties but is practicable for baggage animals only; from here the track continues on over more or less broken stony ground for 7 miles, and then leads through the Shared valley. At the 58th mile is the small village Kurdagap, consisting of a number of mud huts ; here ordinary supplies are obtainable in small quantities and water is plentiful and good in an open karez. From Kurdagap the track leads south-west for 2 miles to the foot of a range of hills, and ascends a small kotal, the highest point of which is not more than 200 feet above the -plain; it then descends with a gentle slope for 2 miles and continues on over undulating stony ground. At the 52nd mile, there are some small springs of water under the ieitbank of a nala whose width varies from 1004 a well close by, water in it is ! 2 feet from the surface and about 2 feet deep, was very dirty, but if cleaned out a few times would probably be good for drinking ; the track still continues in a south-west direction over the daman. At the 158th mile Padag camping ground is reached ; there is a levy thana post here situated a little to the north of a small hill called ‘ Padag post the water- supply here from 2 wells is good. From Padag the track continues south-west, and for the first time enters Padag to Yadgar, 24 miles. the region of sand-hills. The sand along . this route will be a serious difficultv for a Telegraph line, and would probably give trouble for construction as well as for efficient maintenance afterwards. At this particular place immediately west of Padag the line can with advantage be taken about 2 miles south of the track or trade route wffiere firm soil will be met wnth. A glance at the accompanying m ip, sheets Nos. 22-N. W. and 22-S. YV., will show roughly the suggested deviation ; the dotted lines in red represent the trade route. At 6 miles west of Padag the sand hills cease ; 6 to 13 miles the track is over a pat plain with surface of sand ; at the 13th mile a belt of sand-hills about ^ of a mile wide is crossed ; posts here ubll require medium foundations of stoned a description of stone foundations is referred to in paragraph 7 of this report • 13 to 23 miles over soft soil, mostly pat and sand ; 23 to 24 miles through sand hills, medium stone foundations for posts required here. At the 182nd mile from Quetta is Yadgar; there is a levy post here and the water-supply from 4 wells is good ; the camping ground is a pat plain, 2,000 yards long and r,5oo yards wide, surrounded by sand-hills varying in height from 30 to 200 feet high. From \adgar the track leads south-west ; first mile through sand; 2 to 6 Yadgar to Karodaic. miles over level pat with 3 narrow belts • vr 1 rm u 1. sanc ^ be crossed; at the 6th mile ts Nok Chah where 5 wells are sunk in a small pat plain surrounded by sand-hills; the water in these wells was 25 feet from the surface and ^uld probably befit for dunking if the wells were cleaned out. At the 7th mile a belt of heavy sand about J mile wide is crossed ; 8th mile over sand pat, 9 th to ,6th mdes the track is almost due west and over pat plain with belts of sand-hdls to be cessed at every mile. At 199 miles from Quetta is Karodak camping ground ; the supply of water here from one well is~fairlv good; a mud hut in which a chowkidar lives marks the place. ^ From Karodak the track leads almost due west, and for the first mile leads Karoda* to Daibandin. through low sand-hills ; 2 to 8 miles mostly , over pat with a few small belts of at intervals ; at the 8th mile the dry bed of the nala Lagap is crossed, width about so^KandyYgravdiy P ‘ nS banks on either side i 8 &gt; 4 miles over level plain, At the v 13th mile from Quetta, Dalbandin is reached ; there is a comparatively large levy Thana here but no v.llage of any sort ; the water-supply from a small open stream is plentiful and good. ^ ; From Dalbandin the track leads almost Dalbandin to Juzaki. due west; for first 5 miles over sandy gravelly plain, then along the base •, J 11 f • o M ran £ e l ow hills for 4 miles; at the 10th m,le crosses dry bed of r.ver Sorgrl, width .00 yards, banks about 20 feet hi‘h one.ther side; for the last 20 miles of this march the course is almost due weft and the track continues on over undulating stony ground. In Statement n attached to Estimate Part I, is given a list ot rivers met wuth and the c'ass of pos-s and wire estimated for crossing them ; 4 of these are between Dalbandin and Juzaki, ty., at 13th mile Sondur ; at 14th mile Kahni (in litis nala are 2 veils which contained some stale water and if cleaned out would probably give some fit for drinking) ; at the22nd mile Soran nala; at the 26th mile Dandand nala; all these n vers or nalas, as well as the remainder mentioned in Statement D were ’perfectly dry during the time of my tour in the country, some showed signs of waterflow’ the4 highest flood level being from 2 to 4 feet high ; local guides say, although they could not remember having seen floods, that occasionally a. waterflow does make its appearance, so it is as well for a telegraph wire to span them. At the 243rd mile from Quetta is Juzaki camping ground, a levy shelter hut marks the place ; here the water-supply is from a small spring and is not fit for drinking; it is brackish and purgative. From Juzaki the track continues on just a little north of due west, over t0 Mitui . undulating stony ground, broken up by nala beds. At 1st mile is Juzaki nala. At 2nd At 5th At 6th At 7th At 1 ath At 14th Ismaili „ Gatamul,, Sotak „ Meski „ Alungi „ Laki ,, there are 2 branches of this, as mentioned in Statement D; these join into each other about £ mile south of the camel track. At 18th mile is Peshi nala. At 19th At 21 st Gidampatki nala. Mirui On reaching Mirui nala the track turns north and leads up the nala bed for $ mile to Mirui camping ground ; at the 264th mile from Quetta there is a levy Thana post at Mirui, the water-supply from wells in the nala bed is good and plentiful. From Mirui the track continues west and ascends for 6 miles through a Miniito Chahsund.n. narrow valley with low hills on either side, ... 5011 stonv and hard ; at the 7th mile crosses a drv nala bed 300 yards wide with banks on either side about 8 feet high • at the 11th mile a similar dry nala bed is crossed ; 7 to n miles over a broad open plain soil stony mixed with sand in places ; at the 12th mile is the mountain Koh-i- Mahk Gat, which stands out by itself, rising abruptly out of the plain t0 u a k u 1 ° f , &gt; 2 °? feet approximately; its lower slopes are steep, over tthich the rock rises almost in perpendicular precipices; this mountain makes an excellent land mark, and can be seen for miles around ; the camel track passes about 200 &gt; arcs to the north of it, and continues on over an open plain with gra velly surface ; 17 to 21 miles the ground becomes undulating and uneven ; at the 20th mile a dry nala bed 450 yards wide is crossed, its west bank is 30 feet high, rhVm^ ab ° Ut 5 . feet ’ Wlth ^ g ra ^ ial slo P e * At Me 285th mile from Quettf is water fronfone'we^Hs'good^and p1ent^ful. hUt markS ^ P laCe - here -F? 1 ? ° f From Chahsundan the track turns north-west and leads over an open plain with Chahsundan to Butak. hard stony soil for i (5 miles ; this part of desert tothenorth by the Malik Naror'inVofhi'ik i L S .'; eltered fr ?. m ( the sand is Butak Camnincr fk \ ^ h 11S ' At the 3 ° lSt mile fr °m Quetta soil descending thrmwh a m i es through sand ; 9 to 12 miles over stony sou, aescending through a narrow valley with low hills on either side the s.opes of whtcn are covered with sand ; 12 to .5 miles through sand the place^Va'terhTreVs'pL^fu!'and ^ercolltesT'' 51 gr ° Und : 3 lev y h , ut mar y the north • it is of a filiM rln-^ • ^ • (oldtes ‘ ro,ri some rising ground towards ed^vit^h'e 'defecta of /oat:^ cld's'^ !°t gr ° Und ck ' Se ^ being saturat- purposes by digging a fresh well. ’ bUL be ter Can be cbtaint;d for Annkingft cS) 4 ► From Manzil the track leads almost south-west for two miles over sand-hillSi round the south-east spur of a low range of hills called Ahinak ; 2 to 3 miles over a sandy stony plain, studded with irregular mounds of sand, direction still south-west; 3 5 m iles over soft sand, direction west north-west; 5 to 11 miles sand becomes firmer; n to 16 miles, soil sand and some small stones ; 16 to 21 miles over sand with gravelly surface.

At the 359th mile from Quetta is Amir Chah camping ground. There is a levy thana post here and the supply of water from 3 wells is good. me cun* o^. The following notes regarding “ marking out ” may be of use Aiio.nm.nf ,nj 1 • . 17 „ t struction of the line is undertaken ; from Quetta there will be no difficulty in fixing on a suitable alignment as far as Kishingi, 84 miles; from Kishingi the course will be almost due west as far as Nushki; about 4 miles west of Kishingi the line will descend from the plateau on to the plain; it will be necessary to go carefully over the ground here with a view to getting an easy descent, and one that will be accessible to the line staff on maintenance patrol duty afterwards. From the top of Kishingi plateau, overlooking the plain west, a good view of the country over which the line will run is obtained. Mekh Mall, the small hill north of Shakkar Chah can be seen, so that a fixed direction as far as this can readily be followed. It might be well to keep to the south of the Kaisar river at Nushki, but this will depend a good deal on the site selected for the ^^ cer J t ^ rom the hills immediately to the east. From Shakkar Chah the line U1 follow closely the lower slopes of the hills to the south, and continue on through the Nimik Pass as far as Kuchakki. From Kuchakki the line can be taken over very good stiff soil, and within easy sight of the camel track by skirting the lower slopes of the Raskoh-Kohi bheik Hussein range of hills. Padag, the next halting place west of Kuchakki, is situated just north or a small isolated,h»ll called ‘ Padag Post’ ; this hill, about 200 feet high, can be seen about 7 miles distant, and makes a good land mark ; it would perhaps be advisable to keep the Telegraph line south of this, and continue it on for 5 or 6 miles in a south-west direction where firm soil is met with ; this will avoid crossing Uie belt of sand-hills immediately west of Padag. The next halting ground is \ adgar in the open plain, its prismatic compass bearings with the following hills are Mekh-i-Rustam ... ... ... ... 32* Chappir ... ... ... ... ... 388° Raskoh ... ... ... ... ... Il0 0 the course will be almost due west, and will continue on so beyond Dalbandin over a level plain, except where sand-hills are crossed ; the main object in mark ing out along here will be to avoid sand ; it will be impossible to do this al together ; from Dalbandin the course will be directed immediately to the south of a low range of hills, about 5 miles distant, and will continue on almost due west as far as Mirui ; between Dalbandin and Mirui are several dry nala beds to be crossed, vtde Statement D ; the general alignment here will depend on the sites selected for spans at these nalas. Prismatic compass bearings of Mirui from a hill close to the camping ground with the following hills are :— ... 3 2 4 ° ... 35 o° ... 283° Malik Naro Malik Teznan Malik Gat6 ♦ * ♦ * r v From Mirui the Koh-i-Malik Gat can readily be seen from any rising ground • the trade route passes about 200 yards to the north of this, so that the general direction can at once be determined on westwards. From Koh-i-Malik Gat the sand-hill Sor Reg, 6i miles away, can be seen by the aid of field glasses and from Sor Reg the Koh-i-Malik Gat can, on a clear day, be seen by the naked eve - hence there will be no difficulty in fixing the direction here ; the sand, however' west of Butak will give a lot of trouble, and the greatest care will be required in marking out between that and Amir Chah. It will be necessary to have local guides for each stage west of Butak • the camel track often gets lost in the sand and a stranger to the place without a guide would soon find himself in difficulties. The cournry along here is of the most desolate description ; no signs of life or habitation are to be seen excent at the levy shelter posts along the route. P 4a.

The population of Ladis, or Barziar as shewn on the map, consists of about 170 men and 300 women and children; these live in gidans or small little black tents grouped together in clusters over the plain, they are very primitive in their habits, and cultivate just sufficient for their actual requirements ; a small quantity of supplies in the shape of sheep and bhusa can be obtained here, camel grazing is very good, and fuel plenty. The dilapidated ruins of Ladis fort are situated about 1 mile down the right bank of the river. 4c. Between Amir Chah and Ladis a direct course could readily be struck, ... „ , .. . c. . n . but as mentioned above it is advisable to take the line near Duzgi and Mukakat to facilitate the supply of water. From a small rising hill to the west of Amir Chah most of the route can be viewed. The large volcano Koh*i-Taftan, 13,400 feet high, makes an excellent land mark; Ladis is about 25 miles to the N. N.-YV. of this. The following are prismatic compass bearings of Ladis, Mirjawa and Juzhak which may be useful in fixing an alignment:— Ladis to Koh-i-Taftan ... ... ... ... 200 ° Ladis to Miri (Koh-i-Sultan) ..

From Amir Chah the camel track or trade route continues almost due west, Estimate Part in. Amir Chah to Koh-i-Maiik for 5 nules over high sand-hills, varying in Slab, no miles. . height from 40 to 200 feet; next 5 miles over sandy plain with fine gravel on the surface; at the 10th mile a belt of sand hills is crossed; 10th to 19th mile over sandy gravelly plain; 10 to 21 miles over low sand-hills. At the 21st mile Zeh is reached; this is simply a halting place, nothino- to mark it except a belt of sand-hills. From Zeh the course continues west, for 1st mile over belt of heavy sand- Zeh to Bijar Chah. hllls ’ then over gravelly plain for 13 miles ; 13 to 17 miles over high sand-hills. At the 38th mile is Bijar Chah; a levy hut marks the place ; there is one well here, water 60 feet from the surface, brackish and unfit for drinking except by- camels. ^ J From Bijar Chah the track continues on for 3 miles over heavy sand-hills then on to a broad open plain, soil sand with surface of gravel. At the 61st mile from Amir Chah, a range of hills running N. YV.-S. E. is met with ; the track here enters a dry nala bed, and leads up for 4 miles to Saindak halting ground; a levy hut marks the place; a plentiful supply of water can be obtained here by diggino- pits in the nala bed. The course from here to Koh-i-Malik Siah recommended for the telegraph line does not follow the trade route; the latter for the greater part of remaining distance is through hilly countrv, as shewn by the dotted red line on the map, sheet No. 14-N. YV. ; also the track for about 25 miles enters Persian territory, and the camping grounds and levy posts of Said Langar and Bazar are beyond the Frontier, but this may not be any objection ; however it is much simpler to keep the telegraph line along the plain on the outskirts of the hills, where comparatively level ground is met with right up to Robat Killa; no great difficulty for water is anticipated along here; there is a good supply at Kirtaka,. also a small supply at Lashkariab ; water probably could also be obta ned by digging a well at the mouth of the Kacha nala, as further scuth at Said- Langar camping ground there is a plentiful flow in its bed.8 Koh-i-Malik Siah is the name of a mountain, on the top of which is fixed boundary pillar No. 186 where the 3 countries, Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Persia meet. Robat Killa is the name of the camping ground ; it is situated about 5 miles to the south of Koh-i-Malik Siah, just under the southern slope of Robat Koh; here there is a levy thana post; the supply of water from a spring is plentiful, but camel grazing and fuel are very scarce. a,- * j r. . o ...

I cannot say from any experience whether these foundations will be sufficient to make the line safe; 1 simply give the specification from my opinion, some idea of what the country is like will be got from a glance at the photographs accompanying this report. These were taken by G. P. Tate, Esq., of the Survey Department, to whose kindness I am indebted for allowing me to make use of them here. As regards maintenance of a Telegraph line through this sand, I think that there will be considerable trouble ; each post will act as a nucleus for drifting sand to accumulate against, and in the course of some years there is a probability of parts of the line becoming buried. It is difficult to describe to any one who has not actually experienced it what a sand storm in a desert really represents ; as a storm approaches the sand appears to be carried along like a huge wall, and obscures everything from view; travelling against it is altogether impossible and should an interruption to the line occur at such a time, restoration of communica tion would be greatly delayed. 8. It will be seen from paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 dealing with estimates 1, 2 W ter and 3, respectively, that there is a scarcity of water at places along the route. In Estimate Part I, no drinking water is met with between Kani nala and Mirui ,37 miles distant ; at the former place the water in two wells was stale and undrinkable, but if cleaned out would probably become potable ; between Manzil and Amir Chah, 43 miles, there is no water at all. In Estimate Part II, there is practically no drinking water between Amir Chah and Mirjawa about 75 miles ; that at Duzgi, Mukakaf, and Juzhak is brackish and without special treatment undrink able. In Estimate Part III, no drinking water between Amir Chah and Saindak, 65 miles; there is a small quantity at Bijar Chah, 38 miles from Amir Chah, but it is brackish and undrinkable; its supply also is scarce and not sufficient to water more than 50 camels in a day; I have estimated for 2 pairs of water tanks for each working party, made of galvanised iron, and capable of being carried when empty on camels; these will be necessary as reservoirs at camps where there is no supply of water; each pair will weigh empty about 3 maunds, and will hold about 240 gallons. In Statement C attached to Estimates Parts I, II and III will be found the calculation for transport; water will be carried in leather puckhals on camels. 9. In Statements B attached to Estimates I, II and III will be found calcu* SuppHe3&gt; lations for grain supplies. No supplies 0^ any sort are procurable between Nushki district, 96 miles from^ Quetta, and some villages in southern Seistan, about 100 miles north of Koh-i-Malik Siah; hence the necessity of estimating for the transport of grain for the working parties. I may mention that all the supplies and some forage for my party, during my recent tour of 4 months in the country, had to be brought on from Nushki and stored at levy posts along the route according to requirements. 10. The places recommended for Telegraph stations are Nushki, Dalbandin, Telegraph station,. Chah a t n f Ladis, Of Koh-i-Malik Siah. The type of bungalows recommended for each of these places will be seen from the accompanying sketch, and estimate, Statement I, attached. The accommodation consists of 3 rooms, one for the office, and two for signallers* quarters. Two signallers would not, I think, be actually necessary at each, but considering the absolute desolateness of the country it might be advisable not to leave one man altogether by himself. Over the office it is proposed to build some sort of defence parapet, with a pull up ladder from the inside; the country appears fairly quiet; indeed there are few peopleIO met with in it to cause disturbance, but still some provision for defence includ ing iron doors and windows, would be necessary. 1 Nnshki, 96 miles from Quetta, is a comparatively large village as mention^ m paragraph 3, with a levy thana post, and has a good supply of water. I n th ymimty there are slates, sand-stones, and ancient volcanic rocks suitable for mhuf building only. * luuoie Dalian Jin, 813 miles from Quetta, has a levy thana post, and a srnnJ supply or water, but no village near; in its vicinity are ancient volcanic rocks ana granites, very much jointed, and suitable for rubble masonry only Amir Chah. 359 miles from Quetta, has a levy thana post and a fair surmlv of water from three wells, no village near; in the vicinity are ancient volcanir rocks, and limestones, extremely jointed and suitable for rubble masonry only Koh-i-Malik Stall, or Robat Killa, 503 miles from Quetta, has a levy thana post, and a good supply of water, no village near; there is plenty of £rev ^ranihA in the vrcrnty whrch could be shaped in blocks; also nummuIitfc lL^stone could be quarned from the east base of Koh-i-Malik Siah in Afghan territorv his is magnificient material for building and can easily be shaped. ^ * , Th ®, 4 P' aces mentioned above are the most important along the trarf* route; the thanas are very roughly constructed, but offer the § most lt\ come shelter to travellers, the staff at each consists of one Thamadar !

To complete this route and make it fit for caravan traffic, out of the total length of 1,090 miles between Quetta and Meshed, only one comparatively short stretch of 314 miles in the centre requires working up. On our side the road is fairly good from Quetta to Amir Chah, 363 miles, and on the Persian side from Meshed to Neh, a further distance of 413 miles, a total of 776 out of the whole. Of the remaining 314 miles between Amir Chah and Neh, 161 miles are in Persian territory and 153 in British. 2. Taking the British section first, the stages are as follows :— Amir Chah. Miles.

No supplies are procurable, and efforts should be made to establish a village of Baluch settlers. This place is visited by all caravans whether from Neh, Seistan, Sarhad, or the Helmund, and all require supplies. 4. I may here mention that the caravans proceeding from Quetta to Seistan (and vice versa) strike off from the British route here, and make their way direct through Afghan territory along the southern shore of the Gaud-i-Zirreh and up the Shelag to Sehkoha. At present the Amir has no posts in these parts, and the caravans thus get across without interference. The saving in distance is great—no less than 107 miles ; the British route via Koh-i-Malik Siah to Sehkoha being 242 miles, and the direct cut only 135. The loss to us of the Seistan boundary line having been prolonged to Koh-i- Malik Siah is great. Sir Mortimer Durand, after the settlement of the Durand treaty, so fully recognized this that he telegraphed from Tehran, urging that the Amir should not be allowed to get outside the road up the Shelag and recom mending that the triangle up to Koh-i-Malik Siah should be obtained from the Amir in exchange for any concession given to him elsewhere. I hope, if opportunity offers, that this may still be done. 5. Zeh has no water. A well of sweet water is said to have existed here in former days; and if this could be traced and re-opened, all difficulty would cease So far the wells sunk have only produced salt water. 6. Darana Kuh has a well, but the water is salt. A fresh well is necessary • here also. 77. Saindak, Kirtaka and Kacha have all springs or wells of drinkable water Grass and firewood are also plentiful, and all that is required is the location of permanent Baluch settlements at each place to provide transport and supplies. The road between Kirtaka and Kacha requires opening out in the narrow parts. 8. Ziarat-i-Piran. There are ruins and signs of former cultivation here with good water and plenty of grass and firewood. The location of a Baluch settlement here does not seem a question of great difficulty, and cultivation should be encouraged. 9. I may mention that the road between Kacha and Ziarat-i-Piran passes through Persian territory at a place called Bug, 9 miles from Ziarat-i-Piran. The latter Ziarat too is exactly on the frontier. The Persians have no post on this frontier, and no objection is taken to caravans passing through, but how the boundary line came to be drawn through here, I do not know. It ought to have followed the tops of the hills just above ; but so far as I know, this part of the frontier was not visited by the Commissioners. Possibly some chance of rectifying this and of acquiring Bug may occur later on and should not be lost sight of. 10. Koh-i-Malik Siah has good water and plenty of grass and firewood. All that is wanted is a village to furnish camels for transport and supplies. This is the end of the British section of the road. There is a map of this route attached to Major Brazier-Creagh’s report on Seistan, 11. With regard to the remaining sections in Persian territory from Neh to Koh-i-Malik Siah the stages are as follows: — Neh. Miles.

Our efforts, of course, must be directed at first to make the route easy or camels ; but before long, as soon as arrangements can be made for the storage of ohusa and barley and the completion of wells at the different stages in ntis territory, we shall be able to open the route, I hope, to mule traffic. Once that is done, the route will soon become popular. / 4 I /1 August i 8 gg. q £ Y^TE n \ G. C. Press, Simla.— No. 52a F. D- 308-99. 38.Overland Postal Communication with Persia. In my Meshed Diary of the 12th November 1897 1 reported the projected opening of a Persian Post Office at Seistan. There is already a Persian Post Office at Birjand, 277 miles from Meshed and an extension of the line, another 27? miles to Seistan would enable us to come to an arrangement with Persian Government for a mutual exchange of Post Bags at the Frontier Post of Koh-i-Mal.k S.ah, just as the Russian and Persian Post Bags are interchanged at Gondan on the road between Meshed and Askabad in Trans-Caspian lerritory. 2. The opening of through postal communication between Seistan and Meshed would much facilitate our trade with both Seistan and Khorassan and besides that would give us an alternative postal route between Quetta and Meshed in case of disturbances in Afghanistan At present the Indian Post Bag for the Agent to the Governor-General at Meshed is carried by the Am , post through 'Kandahar and Herat. This route may be closed at any moment, and, considering that we spend a lakh and-a-half every year in maintaining the Meshed Agency, an alternative line of direct communication is of much im portance. o We already have a British postal line from Quetta to Koh-i-Malik Siah a distance of 516 miles, and a Persian postal line from Meshed to Birjand, \uth a regular service twice a week from Meshed to Tehran, a further distune nearly 600 miles. The linking up of this small break of 277 miles will therefore give us direct overland communication with Northern Persia instead of round via Bushire, an at no extra cost to ourselves. 4 I would suggest therefore the advisability of Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, being moved to arrange with the Persian Government for the opemng of a Persian Post Office in Seistan and the interchange of Post Bags at Koh-i-Malik Siah. 12th August iSqq. C. E. YATE.Ij, fr Overland Telegraphic Communication between India and Persia. I believe that the Persian Government contemplate extending their line of telegraph from Meshed to Birjand, a distance of 277 miles. The Tehran-Meshed telegraph line, nearly 600 miles in length, is already under British supervision and is kept in good order by the officials of the Indo- European Telegraph Department. The Government of India paying the Persian Government a subsidy of Rs. 20,000 a year to cover the cost of this, dhe line is practically therefore a British line, and can be relied upon to be kept in good order. If the Persian Government now extend this line to Birjand, all that will be necessary to complete through traffic will be to come to an arrangement with the Persian Government for the continuance of the line still further south to Seistan, and for its junction with a British line at the frontier post of Koh-i-Malik Siah, a further distance of 277 miles. 2. The route from Quetta via Nushki to Koh-i-Malik Siah, a distance of Nu hk . 516 miles, has already been surveyed by the Indian Telegraph Department with a view to the construction of a British line to that point, and the completion of the proposed Persian line from Meshed to Seistan will give us a through land wire to Europe, as an alternative in case of accident to the Persian Gulf cable. The saving too in the cost of telegrams between India and Meshed would be great, as only Indian and Persian Inland rates would be levied. 3. The proposed extension to Birjand and Seistan will be just as useful to the Persian Government as it will be to us, and I should think they will be ready to meet our wishes in the matter half way. 4. Of course in this, as in everything else in Persia with us, it will be a question of money. The Persian Government will never incur any outlay themselves. Their plan is to let the line out on contract. If we could get the contract on a promise to the Persian Government of a certain share of the revenues, after the initial cost of construction has been recovered, the concession would probably be agreed to without much difficulty. A concession of this sort wmuld cost a little money, but would be well worth it. 5. The Russians make the Persian Government keep up the Shahrud Astra- bad and Meshed-Sarakhs lines, which join on to theirs, without any subsidy ; but our proposal would bring in money, and ought, therefore, not to be objected to. 6. The total distance from Koh-i-Malik Siah to Meshed is only 554 miles and the possession of this line would add greatly to our power and influence in Eastern Persia. It would help to open up Seistan and Birjand to our trade and to facilitate through traffic with Meshed and Khorassan generally. 7. I would suggest, therefore, that negotiations should be opened with the Persian Government on the subject through Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 12th August i8gg % C. E. YATE. G. C.

M. Sykes to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Political No. 9. Near Kain, aist August 1899. To The Right Honourable the Marquess of Salisbury, K. G. My Lord, In the following despatch, I propose to give some account of the ruling family of Kain, which also governs Seistan, Tabbas and Tun, as I am now in a position to speak with certainty on two or three points, as to which I have hither to been without information. With regard to the history of the family, they know little or nothing abouj themselves except that they believe that they are members of the Arab tribe o* Khazai, which driven out of Bahrein, finally reached Kain from the shores of the Persian Gulf, the district of Bandan, its southern border, first falling under their influence. The province of Kain, until the middle of the present century, was practically independent, but yet occasionally paid tribute to Herat, the attitude of its chiefs being described to me by a Khan as that of “ looking two ways.” After the death of Yar Mohamed, the infamous yet able vizier of Herat, the Persian Government which had failed in its strenuous efforts to seize that city, had to be content with some of its outlying provinces, Kain being annexed with other districts to the north, the ruling family experiencing good treatment, be came attached to Persia and, at the time of the Goldsmid mission, we find that Mir Alum Khan had rendered his Government yeoman’s service by annexing the most valuable portion of Seistan. It must be remembered that the Amir of Kain was perhaps about on a par, as regards education, with a mediaeval border baron, so that his treatment of the mission is not surprising, as its true position and aims were never grasped by him ; otherwise, in my humble opinion, instead of showing himself openly hostile, he would have been anxious to court the British Commissioner, upon whose arbitral decision, the result of all his efforts depended. In any case although jealous of his dignity, he received Colonel MacGregor and other officers with courtesy, and remained a practically independent ruler of Kain and Seistan, until his death, in 1891. When this event occurred he had three sons and a daughter living, the former being by three separate wives which, as may be supposed, was not calcu lated to ensure a harmonious division of the property. His eldest son, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk who was absent in Seistan, was, it is understood, jockeyed out of his share of the hoarded cash, the whole of which was appropriated by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the present Amir of Kain ; in conse quence, the family, since that date has been split up into two hostile factions, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk being supported by his half brother, who is now perhaps 18, while the sister, who is married to a local Khan, is on the side of the head of the family. To take the Hashmat-ul-Mulk first, I have not, as yet, made his acquain tance, but he is universally considered to be of a higher type than his brother and, upon the whole, is more influential, his age is close on 50. IHis eldest son, Mir Masum, was Governor of Seistan, upon my arrival there, and some account of him may be of interest. Appointed at the age of perhaps is, the actual power has been mainly in the hands of his mother’s family whose head is Seyid Khan, of the Narin tribe of Baluchis. This was resented by the other chiefs, who repeatedly complained to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk whereupon the latter decided to send down another son Mohamed Reza Khan, in charge of his mother’s brother, Abdul VVahab Beg. The new Governor reached Seistan in January 1898 , and asked to have the fort handed over, but Mir Masum’s party had no idea of yielding and, conse quently, an illness was feigned as an excuse for delay, with the result that matters dragged on, in an indecisive fashion for two months, there being two rulers in Seistan. Mir Masum’s party, however, kept possession of the fort, while the Shaukat-ul-Mulk was only too delighted to intrigue with the officers of the re giment that is drawn from Kain, against his brother, so that the new comer’s party was distinctly the weakest. Abdul VVahab, to end the matter, tried to seize the fort, but, upon a conflict commencing, his own partisans forsook him, and he was obliged to surrender, w hen he swore that he would espouse Mir Masum’s cause, and it w r as finally agreed that he should proceed to Meshed and there win over the Governor- General. Net altogether unnaturally before this arrangement v^as carried out, Abdul VVahab became an object of mistrust and, at a full meeting, it was decided to murder him, the unfortunate man being shot in broad daylight by a slave of Mir Masum. Mortally w r ounded, he took refuge in the Deputy Governor’s house, where the assasin was only persuaded not to fire again, by the victim’s assurance that he would die within the hour.- 1 !

After these events, Mohamed Reza Khan w'as allowed to escape and so the curtain fell on the first act of this singularly cold blooded and premeditated murder. o h Tj 1 * 6 s position at Tabbas is so insecure, as he has ousted hereditary family that he was unable to proceed to Seistan in person, and in consequence, at the time of my arrival, some nine months after the murder, Mir Masum was nominally Governor, albiet Purdil Khan, Sarbandi, was in comDliance and 1 thelr’adherents !' 6 Hashmat - ul ' Mulk - en g a g ed expelling the Narin Baluchis Mir Masum delayed his departure, until the month of March when he re- !“'y P A r ° ce ft d ‘° L Tad bas.

S thy ’ .11 iXS' “■ “ ”'r “»'&gt;»l»Although less than 50 , as he is vicious and depraved and also subject to fits, he will, in all probability die shortly, and, being childless, will be succeeded by his half brother, Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, a bright gentlemanly youth, who is infinitely superior to his surroundings. The Amir received the Hospital Assistant, who has been attached to me, with great distinction, and was most anxious to keep him indefinitely : the latter tills me that he repeatedly asked about British rule in India and his impressions as to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s attitude, corroborate what I have already reported. In conclusion, I think that upon the whole, our position in Eastern Persia, so far as its rulers are concerned, is more satisfactory than that of Russia, as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk is, I feel sure, offended at not being noticed in the distri bution of Samavors by the Tsar, while he has always acted in a friendly manner towards British officials. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk, on the contrary, treated Captain Napier, some six years ago, with marked discourtesy, but yet, he w’ould, in my humble opinion, be equally rude to any Russian officer travelling in a similar position. Thanks, perhaps, to Russia’s ostentatious gifts, I am convinced that he mistrusts that power while, as I have already stated, he considers that our trade interests and the passage of British Indian caravans and traders, afford us a legilimate reason for appointing a political officer : at the same time, his supreme wish is to be left alone, so that his province may remain a backwater of igno rance and misgovernment. The latest information that I have received is to the effect that Mohamed Reza Khan is again to be sent to Seistan in the care of the murdered man’s brother, while the Hashmat-ul-Mulk is arranging to send a large party with him, to avoid a second tragedy; also a servant of the Governor-General is now there on a special mission, and was arranging for the return of the Baluchi exiled chiefs, until the Seistan headmen, by subscribing £2 apiece persuaded him to desist. It is, therefore, improbable that any change will be made in the status quo for some time to come, and it is to be hoped that Seistan, where I am arranging fora British Indian firm to commence business, will recover its former tranquillity. 1 3 G.

In this present despatch, I propose to give some account of my return One enclosure. journey to Seistan, as well as to note the state of affairs in that district, which I am shortly leaving for my head quarters at Kerman. In selecting the route, my main object was to finally ascertain which was Vide sketch. ^ ie artery or arteries of commerce from the coast, to efiect which, in the first place, I obliquely crossed every valley lying to the west, as far as Basiran, which is situated on the borders of the Great Desert: thence Neh was visited— the point of junction for both routes from the South—and, from this important centre, we travelled East, striking my former route at Bslndan, which is the &lt; f— last village passed on the road to Seistan. . After having formally installed Hospital Assistant Ghulam Jilani and having concluded the solitary pending cave, there was nothing to delay me at Birjand, except the usual difficulties of engaging transport on fair terms, but this chronic annoyance was finally surmounted and, on October 5 th, we marched to Bujd. As far as the second stage of Mud, the main route from Seistan to Birjand was tollowed, but, from this village, we marched across the range to the west into unexplored country. On our way, we visited the famous cave of Chinishk, w nek is of great lepute as a shrine and which had recently been visited by Mir Masum Khan, ex-Governor of Seistan, who hoped thereby to improve his failing eyesight, although, owing to his drunken habits, the ministrations of Ghulam Jiiani had been unsuccessful. Th f cave is entered by an almost perpendicular descent for perhaps thirty feet, after which it is necessary to crawl past a box, containing bones and skulk Ike crux consists of a small round hole, which I could barely draw myself through and the cave was then somewhat loftier and wider and, passing fivingrock Ske et ° n ’ We reaclled a tank som e eight feet square, hewn out of the A second descent was here necessary and we saw other skeletons, all in a good state of preservation and were informed that these galleries continued for many miles, which is, however, open to doubt. The return, owing to the slippery nature of the rocks was difficult although we were bare ooted, and, after successfully repassing the narrow hole the upper air was regained and Virgil's description of Avernus came into my mmd as, what with want ol air and much crawling and slippin 0, the experience was more curious than agreeable. The keeper ot the shrine had a legend to the effect that the skeletons were the mortal remains of pilgrims who °kearino- of the murder of the Emam Baza, when on their wa/to Melhed, dec “ed to spend the rest of their lives in this cave. uemueu toa &lt; N * * An important route was struck at Mukhteran, but it was not until the next range was crossed, that we found that we had, at length, hit off the main caravan route, which is shown in the sketch by a blue line. Upon enquiry, it appeared that the grazing in this valley is superior to that along the course of the other routes and that, on this account, it is always used. Our camels evidently appreciated this fact as, at night, nine of them, including my eight riding camels, were reported as missing. This having happened before, I was not anxious but, after despatching men in every direction, their tracks could not be distinguished. Sending the main camp on to Basiran, I stayed behind and, in the after noon, seven camels returned of their own accord, but not the other two, and I am afraid that they are lost, as they were finally tracked for miles into the Dasht-i- Lut. During our enforced halt of three days at Basiran, a visit was paid to the pre-Muhammadan mines of Kalazarri a “ Golden Fort. ,, A twelve mile ride brought us to a small square fort, built of unhewn stones and mortar, which had evidently been constructed to protect the smelt ing works, where heaps of slag and some modern huts, with the most primitive appliances, were inspected. The actual mines are situated some two miles to the south, at the foot of the last low black range, between Kain and the Great Desert. The system of mining was either to dig shafts, some seventy feet deep, con nected by galleries, or else to work by cuttings. The former were not accessible to our party, but the cuttings, which were also on a large scale, we examined at leisure. Specimens what I believe to be copper, cobalt and perhaps lead, w T ere procured, but there were no inscriptions or rock sculptures, which was a disappointment. I may mention that none of the Muhammadan travellers, who visited Neh, notice these mines, so that the galleries must be of great antiquity, nowadays, during the winter, bits of ore are collected and the copper extracted, but the output is insignificant and only pays, as labour that would otherwise be idle, is employed. After three days of ineffectual search, without any news, the journey was continued to the small township of Neh. There enquiries were made, which corroborated what I had previously Vide sketch. heard, so that I can now state with certainty, that there are two parallel roads running North from Narmishir, both of which meet at Neh and that these are the through caravan routes! As Neh is fully a hundred miles west of Seistan, this fact bears out what No. 4, Political, of 14th February 1899 . ^ Wr0 ^ e i n a previous despatch to the , . . effect that Seistan was remote from the main arteries of commerce and also that the Quetta route would be more than a hundred fciUs longer than the route from Bandar Abbas, if the entire distance to Meshed were measured. Taking these facts into consideration and as Bussia has neither trade noi subjects in Seistan (although some Russian goods are sold in Seistan by Biriand merchants) if she were aware of the. course of the trade routes, which is doubt ful, smely her Vice-Consul m Seistan, would be almost an ‘Agent provo t0 the GaSt ° f is a most intere sting fort, which has not been noticed by previous travellers: it is by far the best specimen of nre- ^ U an“Neh W ° ° £ ^ ^ that 1 baTe seen and was undoubtedly thedfc Sei.tfn on r 25tbioet n n h7 e '’’T a , gail ? in l &gt; ne *pl&lt;&gt;red country and finally reached four ‘ ho -“ d ^/ 3 The new Governor is Sarhang Muhammad Raza Khan, an elder son of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk by a concubine, but the actual work, as iDefore, is carried on by the Deputy Governor. Attended^ by the usual posse, both these officials rode out to meet us, while the garrison lined the road near our camp. I have much pleasure in reporting that we received a genuine welcome, which favourably contrasted with Birjand, where the intercourse was always official. Seistan at the present time, is as dry as it was water-logged when we left it in April • the Helmund flood was of smaller volume than usual, while none of the other rivers gave any help whatever, so that the lake is not, except for a small area to the \\ est, known as the &lt;e Sea of Sabr,’ , and wells are the order of the day. TJnlike most portions of Persia, owing to the utterly defective system of irrigation, there is no autumn crop, while the main canal has been choked by sand and a diversion is being excavated. Ilospital Assistant Abbas Ali appears to be a particularly good man for th© work of Agent, as he has already been twice to Seistan, in 1897 and again, in 1898, so that he knows and is known to everybody, while the unhealthy climate of Seistan makes medical attendance, a sure passport to good will. The district is not in a satisfactory state, as the Baluchi relations of the late Governor are trying, by raiding and stealing, to discredit the new ruler, but as their unpopularity is increased by each act of violence, the policy would appear to be short-sighted. In conclusion, I would beg to mention that but one small case was pend- ing in Seistan, while all fresh information fully confirms my views, already expressed on the subject of the Quetta road.

(No. 12 .) My Lord, Kerman, December 18, 1899. In the following despatch I have the honour to give an account of my journey from Seistan to Kerman, which is the last section of my somewhat lengthy and trying tour. As I found that I had to pay for my camels while in Seistan, my stay in the district was somewhat shorter than I had intended, but, at the same time, there was nothing whatever to detain me, and I was able to leave with the agreeable feeling that the agent whom I had installed was among friends. Just before 'starting into the desert I received instructions to send back the rest of my escort, a total of eight. This I did with some reluctance, as with recent information from Ispahan as to the escort of the Russian Consul at that city, and the position he had thereby, partly, at any rate, acquired, I regretted that I was not allowed to keep four sowars, more especially as, from the fact of this post being an unsalaried one, my private means are not sufficiently large to keep more than two or three mounted servants. The desert lying between Seistan and Narmeshir—a distance of approxi mately 200 miles—is divided into two almost equal sections by the village of Isfeh, with its modern name of Nasratabad. Historically the route is of interest as being, in all probability, the one followed by Kateros, who rejoined Alexander the Great in Jiruft or Rudbar. Some thirty years ago it was traversed by the Seistan Mission, but evidently little, if any, survey was made, as, in the official maps, their route is only shown dotted; however, on the present occasion, a survey from the new fixed points was carried right across the desert, in spite of the obvious difficulties, a piece of work reflecting much credit on the able surveyor attached to me. The first two stages lay among the ruins of ancient Seistan, teeming with legends of the matchless Rustam, after which a march of 37 miles brought us to Turshab, or “Ritter Water”. A day’s halt was necessitated by the exhaustion of the camels, and then two more long stages brought us to Nasratabad which is a true oasis in the desert. Lying at an elevation of 3,800 feet, this village, which was, it is said, founded by Isfundiar, possesses a large kanat of fair water and excellent camel grazing. At the present time there are some thirty families of cultivators, while I saw quite a dozen Baluch tents pitched close by. We had taken barley for the whole journey, but our supply of straw was replenished, and as that is the most bulky article of forage, we were glad to find an abundance of it. Other supplies were also procurable in fair quantities. From the point of view of trade, the existence of this oasis is of the greatest value, and I could not help wishing that the Nushki-Quetta road possessed a similar village, where wayworn caravans could rest for a few da vs. Beyond the commercial aspect, Nasratabad is of great strategical import ance as guarding the only pass through the hills to the south, audit is this fact that proves to my mind that Krateros came this way, there being no alternative route from the Helmund. 12 To continue, after a day’s halt, we rose up to the range on the south and, at 9 miles, passed through what is known as “ Nadir’s Gate A manuscript, containing a history of the Seljuks of Iverman, has, how ever, recently been printed, of which I am engaged in writing a precis in English ; in 'it a full account is given of this gateway, which was towered and secured by an iron door, in the eleventh century. The ruined towers are still extant, and the whole defile is of the greatest strength, as, for miles, single file must be maintained. One night we bivouacked, using water carried from Nasratabad for the horses, and the next morning found us at Gurg, or “The Wolf,” which is considered the most appalling part of the Dasht-i-Gut. M. Khanikoff, who had also visited the Kara Kum desert, emphatically declares that it yields the palm in sterility to the great Persian waste. Person ally, from what I saw of the former desert, when travelling to and from Samarkand, I could imagine nothing worse than the miles of moving sandhills, without any landmark. However, my four journeys across the Dasht-i-Lut, with the exception of the first, have all been accomplished without incident, which perhaps makes me under-estimate its terrors. To resume, the water was almost undrinkable, even for our horses and camels, while a bitter stream—not the Rud-i-Mahi as shown in the latest map— trickles away to the west and, even in November, the mosquitoes were trying, but we could not even faintly realise the horrors of the route in midsummer. At the time of our arrival, a band of nine robbers was at this stage, so we all had to march together and also afford protection to four caravans, who awaited our arrival. The fact is that, at Nasratabad, where a force of forty camelry is nominally maintained, none are paid and, consequently, not even four men could be pro vided as escort. I have, of course, made strong representations on this point to the Governor-General, as it is intolerable that a main trade route should be rendered unsafe in this way. Erom Gurg, two more stages, of great length, lay between us and Eahraj. On the way we saw the two columns, also built by the same Seljirk, Kaward, to guide travellers, and realised how easily the track is lost among the moving sandhills. Eahraj is a village with 200 houses, and formed a delightful prospect of green palms and mimosa, but as I heard that Captain Napier, of the Intelli gence Pranch, had already passed through Narmeshir, I pressed on as fast as possible, travelling by the same route as in 1898. Kerman was reached on the 2 nd December, where, after the usual official reception, a journey of sixteen months under canvas was brought to a successful termination. As I have, perhaps finally, quitted Eastern Persia, I beg to state my opin ion that, after considering the question in all its bearings for a year, 1 am profoundly impressed with the feeling^ that although but little commercial advantage may accrue, politically speaking, the four districts under my charge, form the glacis of India, and that to allow Russia a firm footin &lt;r thereon would vitally affect our interests. General Macgregor, although writing from a different point of view, speaks of Kain as 'a point d'appui against Afghanistan”. I read this since writing despatch No. 10, but I am glad to see that his great authority supports my The strategical side of this question is worked out at greater length in Captam Napier s “ Report on Southern Persia ”, in which my theory is embodied, and which will shortly be published. j &gt;I have Lad the great advantage of studying the Karun question on the spot, and would venture to express the opinion that, from the point of view of commerce, South-Western Persia offers an infinitely more attractive field, while, if in the future it be intended to control the Shat-el-Arab, its political importance is very great. On the other hand, I would urge that our vital interests lie on this side of Persia, and that, as a consequence, our efforts should be directed to maintaining British prestige in Eastern and South-Eastern Persia, as is now being done, and that, in case of Russian appointments, no money should be spared to insure the success of that policy, as 1 feel sure that, in case of a choice being inevitable, the Meshed establishment should be reduced rather than that Seistan and Kain should be neglected. I have, &amp;c:, (Signed) P. Molesworth Sykes.No. 1. Major Sykes to the Marquess of Salisbury .—{Received March 6 .) My'Lord, , . Kerman, January S, 1900. IN the following despatch I have the honour to give some account or tne curec Kerman-Quetta caravan trade that I am trying to establish. When I left Kerman at the end of 1898 for the British frontier I took specimens of the famous carpets which Captain Webb Ware, Political Assistant, Cnagai, forwarded for me to Quetta, where they were much admired, and, in consequence, was assured that there would he a considerable demand. During the year that I spen in Eastern Persia I engaged in constant correspondence on this subject, and, as the plague favoured my plan by the continuance of quarantine in the Persian Gulf and at the ports of India, upon my return to Kerman I determined to act. Agha Mahomed Hadi, a Persian merchant, who has been my unpaid agent, and the Parsi community rose to the occasion, and after a careful selection, to avoid any patterns not pleasing to European taste, one silk and some eighty woollen carpets were prepared. In addition to this a load of pistachios, some saffron, specimens of shawl and of silk were got ready, together with a few homespuns. . The Parsi Council wrote to the Council at Quetta, while all prices were marked m rupees. . . . As agreed upon, Captain Webb Ware sent two of his levies from Kuh-i-MaliK Siah, who reached me just before Christmas. As it was impossible to hire five camels at a reasonable rate, while it was politic to insure a handsome profit to this the first venture, I gave three Government camels, which I have asked Captain Webb Ware to purchase at their Kerman valuation, and two more were purchased. . The Governor-General was informed of what was being done, and is being held responsible, but as he has already acted upon my previous representations to pacificate this section of the desert, and as there are two armed levies, I do not anticipate trouble in this respect. Finally, as I was informed that my sole emolument, an office allowance, which had been withheld for more than eighteen months, was about to be paid in, I was able to give pecuniary aid to this the first caravan, that is valued at 500/. ^ A glance at the attached sketch* will show that from Kerman to Bam is seven stages, and thence to the frontier perhaps eight long desert marches. In any case the distance is not greater than to the port of Bunder Abbas. From Kuh-i-Malik Siah to Quetta is rather less than 500 miles, or thirty stages, so that from Kerman to Quetta is forty-five stages. A further reference to the map will show that there is a more direct route, which will in future be used, and as the saving will be considerable, it may be calculated that from Kerman to Quetta will be forty stages, the last six of which will lie along a made road with caravanserais. At Quetta there is no import duty, and at present there is no export duty on carpets by this route, so that, owing to these advantages, merchandize can be profitably sent, as return loads of indigo, which is grown in Sind, and tea can be sent, with the further advantage of avoiding sea transport, so deleterious to tea. I do not, my Lord, anticipate that this new route, crossing as it does an appalling desert, will materially affect the Bunder Abbas trade, but I consider that it will immensely help the Quetta route, and will tend to diminish frontier turbulence, while it will open up a new market both for Kerman and Quetta. It is, however, from the political point of view that I expect to derive the greatest benefit, as India will undoubtedly be brought much closer by a route striking our [1875/—2] * Not printed.frontier so close to Bam, while that propinquity will he impressed on the Persian Tn iTi ^ in conclusion, I have left no stone unturned to insure a handsome profit being realized, and if my anticipations he fulfilled large caravans will follow, and although the start be modest, it will, I am confident, lead to much greater things for the mutual benefit of our great Indian Empire and of the Kingdom of the bliah.

I reached Nasratabad, the capital of Seistan, on the 9th instant. The official reception accorded me left nothing to be desired. Indeed from the moment I crossed the frontier into Seistan up to the present nothing could have exceeded the courtesy and consideration with which I have been treated. Every one from the young Deputy Governor downwards has apparently striven to make my visit to Seistan a pleasant one. I am gratified to be able to record this as evidencing the steady growth of our influence in Seistan and South Khorassan. 3. Five days subsequent to my arrival, M. Muller, Russian Vice-Consul for Birjand and Seistan, reached Nasratabad. The reception M. Muller received was also good, but it contrasted unfavourably with the welcome given me. This gentleman’s bearing towards various subordinate Persian officials here has been made the subject of much adverse comment. 4. The Russian Vice-Consul’s staff and establishment consists of the follow- . ing members {a) Mirza Muhammad Ali of Meshed, pay Rs. 165 per mensem with Rs. 99 per mensem fixed travelling allowance. (b) Two Peshkhidmats, natives of Meshed, whose pay is said to be Rs. 33-2-0 each per mensem. (c) One private servant by name Sher Ali Khan, pay unknown. (d) Six Russian troopers (European) with pay ranging from Rs. 33-2-0 to Rs. 26-8-0 each per mensem. 5. My arrival in Seistan, five days before the Russian Vice-Consul, has had an excellent political effect and has gone far to minimize the importance which the Seistanis would have attached to M. Muller’s deputation. 6. In addition to the staff enumerated above, M. Muller informed Hospital Assistant, Abbas Ali, in the course of an interview the latter had rvith him that he expects his staff to be augmented, in the course of the next six or eight weeks by the addition of a Russian Medical Officer. 7. Sardar Purdil Khan informs me that the lands near Mian King! are under water. I am afraid that I will thus not be able to pay a visit to these^ands I was anxious to do so, as they have been the cause of much bad blood between the Afghans and inhabitants of Seistan. I trust, however, that before leaving Seistan I will have mastered the ins and outs of this somewhat intricate dispute Diary of the Political Assistant, Chagai, for the week ending 24 th February 1900. lyth to 24th. —Halt at Nasratabad. 3. M. A. Muller, the Russian Vice-Consul in Seistan, called on me on 17th and I returned his call the following day. • 13 . In the course of the interviews, I have had with this gentleman, I have gathered the following items of information :— M. Muller was summoned to St. Petersburg to receive instructions on the subject of his deputation to Seistan from the Russian Foreign Office. His orders compel him to remain in Seistan three years, and do not apparent ly admit of his passing the heat of the summer at Birjand or in the hills. 1 he Cossack escort, with which he is furnished, is composed of troopers from little Russia.* It appears that he establishmen^arld escorHs Considerably ^ss'ihan applied for a Turkman CSCOrt, but his as shown in paragraph 4 of my diary for the week request Was Overruled On the ground that ending 16th February 1900. r t 1 ' c * j. the presence of I urkman sowars in beistan was likely to offend the susceptibilities of the Seistanis. M. Muller has ordered two Indian papers.f He proposes asking permis sion for these papers being forwarded him through Quetta and Nushki. t The ' Pioneer ” and the ' Times of India I understand from him that the Russian authorities are pressing the Persians to open a post office in Seistan. M. Zaradin, the Russian Zoologist, who travelled down the Perso-Baluch frontier in 1898 , is an ^-officer of the Russian Army. M. Muller has an idea of making Sekoha his head-quarters, but I under stand that Sardar Purdil Khan is much opposed to this. The drift of his questions evince an anxiety to ascertain— (a) The size and constitution of the Koh-i-Malik-Siah post. (3) Whether there is a likelihood of a railway being built from Quetta to Seistan. (c) The number and names of various stages on the caravan route between Seistan and Nushki, (i) The size of Nushki and the nature of the supplies procurable there. Unless I am in error he has received instructions to report on these matters. G. C. Prcis, Simla.—No, 911 F.

C Webb-Ware, Political Assistant, Chageh. Yours of the 1st instant just received:—You ask me for an expression of opinion regarding the outlook in Seistan and what my views are as to the steps which can best be taken to modify it so far as it concerns Seistan and this Frontier. I see that the papers I have received this day say that one of the conditions, under which Russia advanced the recent loan to Persia, was that in exchange she obtains from Persia the right of free passage for her troops over Seistan. Assuming that this is correct, and I think it by no means unlikely, although I confess my sur prise that this condition has become public property, it can merely convey to any one, who has studied the question, one meaning, viz that Russia attaches extreme importance to the possession of the military right of passage through Seistan, in order that she may use that country, when it suits her ends to do so, as a basis for offensive action, moral or active, against Afghanistan, and so India. I need not tell you what would be the position of an Afghan force striving to repel an invasion of N. Afghanistan, if a Russian force advanced along the Helmund and penetrated to the vitals of their country. Well armed and good fighters although the Afghans undoubtedly are yet in this eventuality they could not hope to continue the struggle with any chance of ultimate success or, I fear, hope for succour from us. With the loss of Afghanistan naturally goes the larger portion of Southern Persia. The very knowledge that Russia possesses the right in Seistan, I note, appears to me, to convey with it a very real element of danger. The Amir is a particularly strong shrewd man, who up to the present has concluded that his and our interests are so closely allied that they can only be disassociated to his disadvantage, yet in every respect he is an Afghan. Knowing his character, as we do, it is not too much to suppose that seeing his country being slowly encircled by Russia, active preparations being made for its attack, Persia being slowly, but surely, engulfed, and no counter preparations or precautions being taken by us, he will think his interests necessitate a modification of his present bearing towards Russia. He would be more than human, and no Afghan, if he did not do so. Remember what I say of the Amir applies with equal, if not greater force to the Baluchs of Seistan, the Helmund Valley, and of the Sarhad, who are now heart and soul with us. Try and imagine for one moment the state of Baluchistan with a Russian post, of the Turbut-i-Haideri type stationed in Seistan : it would be insufferable. Why, every petty Baluch Chief who imagines that he has cause of grievance against his Political Agent or the Local Government, will fly, not to Kandahar, but to Seistan, to place him - self under the protection of the Russian Agent, and Baluchistan would be kept in a constant state of irritation. We all know how prone Baluch and Brohui alike, are to distort trivial incidents into matters closely concerning their very existence, and by way of protesting to go “ Yagi ” for a few weeks. Suppose we assume that the Amir differs in every essential particular from the ordinary Afghan, and that he is content to rely implicitly on the repeated assurances given him by successive Governments, what is to happen when he dies ? an event that is likely to occur any day. We are, I understand, pledged to support Habibullah Khan. The Russians, I gather from Mr. Muller, propose supporting Muhammad Umar’s candidature, and not Ishak Khan’s, and the result will be—well one thing is very certain—the Russians, who display so marked an aptitude for fishing in troubled waters, would find that the safety of their Central Asia Province imperatively demanded the presence of Russian troops in Afghanistan. To turn to the possible remedies, which can, in my opinion, be applied to the present situation there. I write with diffidence as the question is one of Imperial policy and interest, far beyond my petty scope. The remedies, or rather I should say the local remedies, I would apply, if the initiative rested with me, would be somewhat as follows:— Retaining our two Native Agents at Birjand and Nasratabad, who have both done excellent work, I would appoint a British Officer to Seistan permanently with adequate Staff, included among whom would necesarily be a Medical Officer, and I would give him instructions to inform the Baluch in general and Sardar Purdil Khan, the head of the Seistan Baluch, in particular that we are both ready and willing to support them against Russian aggression. I am fully aware that it is contrary to our traditional policy to support any individual Sardar or party across the frontier and that both the present situation in Teheran and the constitution of Persian Provincial administration render the difficulties of doing so very pronounced ; but if we do not do so, Purdil Khan, who is devoted to us, must either be driven into the arms of the Russians or fall, and with him goes to the wall our prestige on this frontier, now so marked. Refer to para 4 of my diary for the week ending 8th March 1900 and read it in connection with the following incidents. The evening I left Warmul, Sardar Purdil Khan rode over from Daulatabad to see me and bid me good-bye. He was very friendly but evinced much anxiety to learn what was to be our policy in regard to Seistan. Having a very vivid recollection of the rap over the knuckles Lord Elgin gave me, for recording the views I entertained regarding our policy towards S. Khorassan and Seistan, I naturally declined to commit myself in any way ; yet as Purdil Khan was going he suddenly turned to me and said, quite spontaneously: “Sahib, tell your Government that they can always rely on Sardar Purdil Khan.” In a previous letter I think I told you that on one occassion he offered me a thousand men. Purdil Khan is a fine fellow and like every Sardar of importance on this frontier he feels instinctively that a crisis in the history of Persia is approaching and wishes to see how the land lies. Again the Damani have just cut to pieces a man (Persian) who came down from Meshed and was suspected, apparently on good authority, of being a Russian Secret Service Agent. I see you think that the Russian Agent in Seistan will be withdrawn at an early date; dismiss this idea forthwith. Mr. Muller who has taken his house for one year, has instructions to remain in Seistan three years. It would be opposed to the aims with which the Russians are very rightly credited if they withdraw their Agent. The second step I would reccommend, is the one I have so persistently advocated viz the establishment of posts at Duzdap and Mirjawa. The A. G. G. recently wrote to me on the subject of the frontier between here and Koh-i-Malik Siah, but he confined himself almost entirely to the question of the ownership of the Kacha Koh LarKoh Hills as far as the limits of the Southern daman of this range. I do not think that the ownership of the strip is at issue, as we have been in quiet possession of this country ever since February 1897, and during this period no question has ever been raised by the Persians regarding its ownership nor has it ever been visited by any Persian Official. It is also my opinion that no question is likely to arise, from pure Persian sources, as to the ownership of Duzdap, at least the Persians have never evinced any intention to assert any claim to this place, although on my side I have always freely given out that Duzdap forms part of my district. To digress for a moment, you will be interested to hear that the Duzdap Mamasani are doin&lt;r very well. They have excavated five Karezes and propose adding to this number. I have just come in from arran^in 0, some of their disputes. . I expect to get about 200 maunds of Bhoosa, this year, off these lands, paying a &amp; purel V nominal price for it, I am insisting on this to emphasize the fact that they owe allegiance to us. As regards Mirjawa, the question is somewhat different, for, as you know, Sykes, last year, gave away the rif ? f ,T y sh 1 0w ’ However &gt; 50 lon g as I know that I have the A. G. G’s. moral support I can stand any number of official knocks, consequent on possible failure. I think I see my way to gain quiet possession of Miriawa with out involving Government. Anything in the form of intrigue is most distastful to me, but as regards Miriawa and Duzdap, I have absolutely no scruple whatever as my researches go to show that there exist three different frontiers viz that on the ground marked by pillars not shown on the map, that on a very sketchy map which differs in many essential particulars from that marked on the ground, themap itself being wholly unreliable, and lastly that i J the mutual agreement, based on the faulty map Irefer to, and quite inconsistent with the boundary marked on the ground. Ever since I came up here, in 1897 my one aim has been to bring Duzdap and Mirjawa under my control In the course of the last conversatioD I had with Mr. Muller, he told me that he understood that the frontier’ be tween Koh-t-Malik Siah and Jalk, had not been demarcated. I was quite taken aback by this remark and I wouldrecommend you to note it. I have little doubt that, as no European member of Holdich’s Commission moved north of Jalk, the Persians would not hesitate to repudiate Holdich’s frontier north of that place, should it suit their, or shall we now say, Russian ends to do so. You will remember that the Afghans try to maintain that the frontier between pilliars 156 and 157 has not been demarcated because McMabon, for reasons quite excusable, failed to march his camp through the heavy sandy hills between these pillars. I feel sure that the establishment of posts at Mirjawa and Duzdap will be found to be a wise measure in the early future. The third step I would take, would be to draw Seistan, Garmsel, Sarhad, and Persian Baluchistan in general, into closer political touch with Quetta (India) by stationing Native Agents at Bampur, Bum and Khwash—this is very important—and by improving the existing communications between Seistan and Quetta. This latter can be done by extending the telegraph system west, by improving the road, possibly by building a railway—this is natarally the best method— and in many other obvious ways. I have always, as you know, maintained that Russian designs on the Gulf can be very effectively checkmated by moves on this frontier.\ G. C. Press, Simla—No. 286 F.

I understand that the Russian doctor, referred to in paragraph 6 of my diary for the week ending 16th February 1900, is expected to^reach Sistan in the course of three weeks. As it is not unlikely that the Russian doctor may inaugurate his arrival in Sistan by initiating plague preventive measures, I would venture to suggest the expediency of appointing a British doctor to Sistan. 8. In the course of the first interview which the Russian Vice-Consul had with the Deputy Governor, he told the latter that Muhammad Ali Brothers, the Quetta firm of merchants, I have established in Sistan, were selling indiflerent goods at exorbitant prices and he recommended the Deputy Governor to warn his people to have no dealings with the firm ; he further is said to have intimated that a Russian firm of merchants intend shortly opening business in Sistan that he advised intending purchasers to defer making purchases till then. 9.

The larger number of the halting places, between Nushki and Killa Robat, have been supplied with iron watering troughs. 4. On the occasion of the hoisting of the Russian flag at Nasratabad by the Russian Vice-Consul, noted in paragraph 6 of my diary for the week ending 28th February, the following noteworthy incident occurred. After the flag had been run up, Sardar Purdil Khan stepped forward and addressed the Russian Consul in the following words :— “ I a m expressing the sentiments of the Persian officials of Seistan, who are present, when I inform you, that we resent the hoisting of the Russian’ flag in Seistan! We have allowed you to hoist the flag of your Government, because we have received instructions from the Governor of Khorasan to permit you to do so ; but we wish you to understand that the inhabitants of Seistan have no thing in common with the Russians, and we fail to understand why you have come here: your Government has no commercial interests in Seistan. If an European officer is to remain stationed in Seistan, vye prefer that he be an English officer, as the British Government have many things in common with us, and have, more over, always been our friends. The Baluch of this country are savage, untutored men, who have no respect for human life: you would therefore be well advised if you keep your flag flying as little as possible.” The covert threat, conveyed in the last sentence, was apparently not lost on Mr. Muller, as the following day he hauled down his flag, and up to the time, 1 left Seistan, he refrained from flying it again. I would venture to call attention to Sardar Purdil Khan’s speech, as it was quite spontaneous, and as far as my experience permits me to judge, Sardar Purdil Khan voiced the feelings of the inhabitants of Seistan. 5. Before leaving Seistan, I arranged the various details connected with that most important matter—Major Chenevix-Trench’s official reception at Nasratabad. Major Trench can rely on receiving an excellent reception, provided he comes armed with his “exequatur,” and provided also that the Rukun-ud-Daula of Khorasan be moved to forward an official notification to Seistan of the appoint ment of a British Consul. The latter has no doubt been arranged for through the Meshed Agency.Diary No 3 of Major-General Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majes- tv’s Consul for Seistan. left Rabat for Hormak, distance ... ... 18 miles. .reached Girdi Thana ji ... ... 3 ^ »&gt; 9 ,, Kundar ... ... 12 „ „ Warmal V ... ... 3 ° » j’ ,, Daulatabad halted » ... ... 8 „ reached Dandi... »&gt; ... ... 20 ,, Nusratabad »» ... ... ^ M 11 th 12th 13 th 14th 15th 16th In my last diary, I fully described the whole route from Quetta to Rabat where our boundary ends, and, 1 hope, showed that there were no real difficulties to be met on the road by travellers that could not be easily remedied, and w are in fact now being removed. From Rabat, the route which now has become a camel path turns north, keep, ing just within the border line made by General Goldsmid in 1872. There is nothing particular to mention about the road here, like the road through Beluchistan it is easy and level. From the between Rabat and Hormak which passes through the hilly range of the Koh-i- Malik Siah, glimpses of the real desert are seen lying to the north and east the real desert w ose terrors have given to the part of country over which the present route runs the bad name it has suffered from for so many years. At Hormak there are some good springs and a good camping ground. Leaving Hormak the road follows the stony bed of a river, which widens out as it approaches the desert to a delta as through joining the sea, the road leaving this delta for the first time now traverses real desert, but within a few ™ l!es &gt; tlie tamarisk shrubs begin to grow up. After 15 miles the desert sand has given place to soil, dry and uncultivated, covered with “ f-hora” certainly, but merely cryin^ out for water to become fertile. A few miles more and two domes are sren on the horizon of the flat country, the first marks the traveller meets of by gone buildings and soon whole mud villages in desolation and ruin stand out on the interminable flat country round. Girdi Thana is reached after a 32 miles march from Hormak. Here is the beginning of a Thana consisting of two or three demed rooms and a wall, the commencement of a good fortified serai, which I hope to see in a short time. All round Girdi Thana are desolate deserted ruined villages within an easy walk. I visited two or three. They are not buried cities in any sense. 1 hey are the ordinary villages seen in Seistan, and do not look as though they had been deserted for as much as a century. Streets walls and domes are all standing. In places the sand has been driven against the walls but the collapse of the domes or roofs has had most to say to the ruined appearance. Near these deserted villages it is easy to see the marks of the walls which enclosed gardens where now the land is dry and the tamarisk alone flourishes. Clear and distinct marks show the canals which originally watered this huge plain, bringing the water of the Helmund I was told that one main canal run- nincr' west towards Girdi Thana had 17 distributing canals on one side and 17 on the^other, which shows that the irrigation from the Helmund over this plain is not a matter of great antiquity but is quite possible now. The road after leaving Girdi Thana still continues across the unwatered soil and past more villages which have been left to crumble back into the thirsty soil. Many were the remarks among my followers that the land over which we rode was far bette. than any land recently watered by the Chenab Canal system.Kundar and Houzdar are both large deserted villages on tbe track. The latter place must have had about 1000 to 1500 houses. It was less ruined than others I had met. The moat was still distinct and the walls of 20 to 30 feet were still standing, even to the decoration on the top. I he entrance gate was not more tumbled down than many I have seen in the east, to inhabited towns. . Here I saw a wall of about 30 to 40 feet which had been the wall of the windmill of the place, and the position of grinding stones, could still be clearly distinguished. Many domed roofs were standing intact and the streets were still streets between walls. I climbed up to an upper story of one house or “ Bala khana ” which would still have been habitable and showed signs of mural decoration and plaster. I describe all this, as these towns, I understood, to be buried cities of great antiquity, whereas I find them mere villages or towns deserted because the water had been cut off from the lands round. Their great antiquity did not strike me and although the towers were con nected with legends of Rustam, the date of their desertion would be more interest- . . . . , ,,, L , ing to us than the dates of their early • I am since informed these villages have been i • * J deserted for 235 years. history After leaving these deserted towns the same land, the same surroundings suddenly show signs of life, fields as far as you could see of wheat were waving green and a deep water course showed that we were within Seistan proper and within the reach of the Helmund waters turned westward by the Seistan bund at Kuhak, the first place the Helmund in its course touches the existing Seistan border. The village of Warmal, the first village in Seistan, is exactly similar to the deserted ones we had past, the same domes and walls, the only deference being that it is populated and thriving. From Warmal to Nusratabad the road passes through fields of wheat, green in the ear when I passed ; some blocks cultivated, others allowed to lie fallow, with the stubble of past year’s crops still standing. Everywhere water dykes and canals and apparently such an abundance of water that ten times the amount used must run to waste and form the great Hamun or lakes which shut in Seistan during the summer on the north and west. Everywhere waste of land and water. Between Hormak and Warmal w r e had ridden 60 miles through country extending as far as you could see on either side, only wasting for water and water to which it had been accustomed. I have now described the road from Quetta to Seistan. I hope I have not done so too graphically for an official diary, and that this general description of the road and surrounding country may be an useful addition to the already excel lent detailed reports in existence. To turn to things political. At Rabat, I received a letter from Abbas Ali, the Hospital Assistant and Political Munshi here, that Amir Ali Akbar Khan Hashmat-ubMulk, had reached Nusratabad from Tabbas on the 28th March and further, that he had said, that he found himself in somewhat of a difficult position, for though desirous of receiving me as a consul, he had had no orders from the Wall of Meshed (Rukn-ud-Daulah) that I had been appointed Consul. Abbas Ali further said, that as the Russian Vice-consul was here, he feared he w T ould get into trouble if he received me or even allowed me into his country without orders. I sent a short reply to Abbas Ali merely stating my programme wffiich I requested him to show to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. At the same time I sent a polite letter to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk informing him of my dates and making no reference to any orders about my appointment. At Hormak, Abbas Ali again wrote to me that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk fearing he 2would ge* into trouble through the Russian Vice Consul, still maintained that un less I could produce some orders he could not admit me into his country. Abbas Ali also sent me a letter confidentially which the head Mujtahid had writ f en to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk urging him not to commit the folly of preventing my entry or of not receiving me. I still continued my march and flew my flag. At Wormal, Abbas Mi met me and brought the following message from the Hashmat'ul* Mulk viz., that if I would only send a copy of any orders I had it would be sufficient to cover him In my difficulty I concluded that though orders had not reached Seistan my appointment had been agreed to by the Persian Government and sol sent the Hashmat^ul Mulk what professed to be a copy of my orders and which was in reality a partial copy of telegrams received from the Foreign such as “ Viceroy has decided to send you as consul to Seistan. You will travel by Quetta accompained by an escort of native cavalry.” When this had been written and translated into Persian with the Viceroy's full titles, etc., Abbas Ali left Warmal and proceeded to Nusratabad to give the letter and to make arrangements for my reception. This method quite satisfied the fiashmat*ul-Mulk who at once ordered everything that was possible for my reception. . Munshi Ahmad Din went with Abbas Ali to Nusratabad, while I continued my march by slow stages. On the 16th I reached Nusratabad. Two miles or more from the town, the vSarhang Mohamad Raza Khan son of the Hashmat*ul-muik met me accompanied by Sardar Purdil Khan, Sarabandi, and about 30 to 40 mounted men. At the entrance to the fort about 300 to 400 Persian Sarbaz were drawn up, etc. I rode with my escort in full dress through the centre of the town within the fort with an outrider in front carrying a small Union Jack on a lance. Everywhere the people showed the greatest respect. After passing through the fort I arrived at my camp, which had been pitched on an excellent site, a far better site than any which had been previously allotted to either Captain Webb Ware or Major Brazier Creagh. Munshi Ahmad Din and Abbas Ali had worked wonders here, two triumphal arches in red had been erected and the whole camp laid out in paths with coloured flags on either side of the paths. A full sized Union Jack was hoisted on my arrival and the Sarhang and Sardar Purdil Khan and all the Kat Khudas who had been summoned for my reception had the usual tea, Kalian, etc. I mention these points, as by these marks of respect the Persian shows his feelings towards the country whose consul he honou-s. The eclat of the whole reception was a very marked contrast to that accorded to Mr. Muller the Russian Vice-Consul. 1 hear that neither the Sarhang nor Purdil Khan nor any mounted men went out to meet him and very few' people took any interest in his coming. I am also told that Purdil Khan informed the Russian Vice-Consul, at a visit of ceremony, that if he flew his flag, he must do it at his own risk, that the Mullas. of Seistan were against it, etc., and that if he did do so, he Purdil Khan could not be responsible in any way for the safety of his person. My flag, which on occasions is a full sized Indian Government one, has floated on a 30 feet flag staff from the moment of my arrival, and the small flag has been carried in front of me within the streets everywhere I have been and not a dissent has been even hinted at. The Russian only ventures to fly his on Sundays and has a very small one. In the evening I had a very good display of fire works at my camp. The Seistanis are adepts at the art of making them. The same evening I received a very large “ Mehmani ” from the Hashmat-ul- mulk two carpets, sheep, etc., this again was not done in the case of the Russian Vice Consul. On the 17th April, the day after my arrival, I paid a visit to the Amir Hashmat-ul-mulk in full uniform, with the escort in full dress, and was received with every attention etc., and the Hashmat-ul-mulk returned my visit on the day following . 34 This with an interchange of visits from the-Sarhang completes the reception and there is no doubt that the Hashmat-ul-mulk and the entire country look with pleasure on the arrival of the representative of the Indian Government, the more so, since they see the sinister influence of Russia in their midst. The Hashmat-ul-mulk is a man of about 50 years, suffers from rheumatism, has a pleasant manner and-looks intelligent. He has travelled somewhat and can talk of Tehran, Railways, etc. His son, the Sarhang, has been described betore, he is very friendly but not brilliant i*n appearance. Our conversations have at present been confined to generalities. Supplies have been easily obtained, the people themselves bringing every thing such as eggs, fish, milk, ete., and even partridges for sale. To day, 19th, I have paid my first visit to the Russian Vice Consul, Mr. Muller. There was some fencing as to who should pay the first visit, but he said as he had paid the first visit to Captain Webb Ware, who was the first arrival, he thought l should pay him the first visit, which I did. He was glad to see me, as he is not happy here and the loneliness seems to depress him, besides which, he is thoroughly eclipsed and only treated with regulation civility. If it were not for the paramount influence of the Russian Consul-General at Meshed over the Wali (Rukn-ud-Daulah) who is the Hashmat- ul-mulk’s superior and who uses the Vice-Consul as a spy on the Hashmat-ul- mulk, the Persians would show Mr. Muller no respect whatever. It is only through fear of what he may write to Meshed that they tolerate him. The Russian Vice-Cousul has hired or bought a house in Hussainabad just outside the Nusratabad fort and just in front of my camp. At first I thought he had an advantage, but now I am in hopes of turning my camping ground to a great use by securing the ground as a right and soon of building some mud domed shelters and so gradually establishing a good house on what is by far the best site and land anywhere round. I hear the Russian Vice-Consul wants to acquire land to start growing crops and that he has already sent for seeds, etc. I shall do all I can to prevent this. At the same time I hope to have a garden round any future building, on the site my camps is, large enough to grow anything. A garden round a house can be a very different acquisition to acres of land at a distance from one’s house 1 The Russian Vice-Consul’s house is so confined that he could not have a garden ! Building is very cheap here indeed, and for a few hundred rupees I could build some good domed rooms and am going to do 'my best to be allowed to. I shall start by housing the Hospital Assistant and then a small one for myself to save me from the heat, which even now is trying. The thermometer is about 100 every day in my tent. There are rumours that the Russians are attaching a European doctor to their consulate, and that he will bring his wife here. Mr. Muller has given large orders to Seth Sulaiman the Quetta shopkeeper here, to buy furniture, tents, etc., for himself, his cossaeks, etc. Later on, when the Political Mission of the Russian Vice-Consul is better known, I shall have much to say on the political situation in Seistan. Whereas in former reports the local politics of Seistan such as the rivalry between the two brothers Mir Abakbar Khan (Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk) and Ismail Khan the Shankat-ul-Mulk at Kain have occupied most attention; the future politics will be rather Russian intentions with reference to Seistan. From what 1 have seen of Mr. Muller, 1 thmk h,m very capable and he is probably very well supported through his Consul General at Meshed and his Minister at Tehran, which makes him powerful though not popular. It is for us, before it is too late, to put forward all our strength at the capital and at Meshed to thwart any coip which may Teh^n h y r , m , als . th ™ ugh ‘he Agency of them influence both at Te ran and Meshed,and. having done this, to be in a position, from the adjacency5 to ouLeWerthradvanUgL^TtrareT^' 3 ' ! nteres , t . s j' ^ P Ia ? e to secure occupy. 43 strategic position which Seistan is known to whose flank is°ev!m'rnore ( j &gt;U ^ ^ u° C ° Unt ° n the su PP ort Afghans* troops to spring up throughout ktoL\ralTleistan luelf^ lndia ’ W6re RUSS!an inch of innucnce'we' S ;irrf ^before me, i e., that there is no time to lose, every ed bv a British offir , lr ^ mus ^.^ e Seistan cannot wait long unrepresent- be pleasinL in manner'and K ^ mUSt be able t0 s P eak P ^. he must pleasing in manner and be provided with all the astuteness he can have. be well eauimllff ! 1 ^P^ es ® ntat ‘ ves ' n Persia in these times should, in my opinion, fi^rcLl^otdialn'dT ^ 0 C ° Py ^ Sty ' e Which forkatheJs o^them As Persia is a^rh^^ rom what I know of Persia, it is necessary, be so highly paid hut u° eS n0t ^ ollovv that the officer himself should generally ^PMs mUSt ^ aV6 mone y t0 spend on presents and largesse feast imposing and welUrrangeTeic . 3 ' 4 CamP be ’ n0t ma g nificent &gt; at for a 77 ^' n 6 able t 0 ^“PP'y.detailed estimates of what would be necessary tothe A^nt ?o ih P rT nenl!y ^ Pp0ln ^ dhere ' inthe “eanwlile, 1 am sending i . r ^ overnor General s office at Quetta hints and suggestions earnt from my own experience which should be a guide to equipment, etc., receded ^ b6 ap P ointed before detailed estimates have been The Bad-i-Sad-o-hist-roz has begun, and at present instead of being a des- comfort makes life possible.

Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan. . 22nd April. In my last diary I mentioned the reception which I received in usratabad fiom the officials and people. There is no doubt that the brilliance o this reception (for Seistan) the decoration of the camp the fla^s. etc., have had a great effect in this country. It was very well done, and I am indebted to Abbas All for having succeeded cleverly in advertising it beforehand. t u r^cption and entry has proved disconcerting to the Russian Vice-Consul. believe him to be quite annoyed that he had had such a mean one, and the fact that the Sarhang, the son of Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, ruler of Seistan, rode out vuth a large following so far to meet me has increased his displeaure. So far as such outward show goes, and in Persia such show counts for much there is no doubt I have scored a point, and a point which should bear fruit later in Meshed when I arrive there. . British influence and prestige has received a great impetus here owing to the flying of the flag, our trade, mainly represented by Seth Sulaiman, the Quetta Merchant, and the various visits of British officers. But owing to our having up to now no very definite policy of either aggression or of the preservation of the rights of Persians in this country, our position is one of mere onlookers. Friendly in spirit undoubtedly, but as real aiders in any time of difficulty 1 fear not. The Persians generally are fully alive to this, and w'ell they may be by the past attitude of the British Government towards them, with its lack of anything more than moral support against the constant demands of the northern power of Russia. What has been written in all books about Persia holds good in Seistan. The Persians like the English, but fear the Russian. The Persian in his present state bends to the fear, easier than he will to his natural inclination. Before the shadow of Russia fell on Seistan. and the Seistani knew no foreigner, he w T as in a mood to be intolerant to all foreigners, and this w r as his mood when Captain Brazier Creagh visited Seistan in 1897. This intolerance gave place to the division of feeling adopted by the rest of Persia, w'hen Seistan became the ground for rivalry between Russia and England. . That feeling of fear of Russia and inclination towards England is now the feeling in Seistan. All intolerance here has vanished. Whatever steps we chose to take to increase our influence here now would not meet with opposition from the Persians perse, but would be opposed either directly by the Russians or else by the Persians acting under the orders of their superiors at Meshed and Tehran at the dictation of Russia. This clearly defines the position in Seistan. From this it follows that, were we in a position to remove this fear from the Persian minds by any means, the Persian here, as elsewhere, would himself be as mailable in our hands and more so than he now is in the hands of the Russians. To show the present state of tolerance. I can live in comfort a peaceable life. I can buy everything I want. I am salaamed to by every man I meet. I can walk alone through any part of the town, and I am welcomed in the small shops! My servants can wander everywhere, and obtain anything they want, even though some are Christians and the rest of the Sunni Branch. Visits of ceremony are friendly, and as many as I like, even visits to the rulers in private, but all these privileges can be and are equally given to the Russian representative.The Persian here is wise, he abandons intolerance a position he sees he cannot hold against the force majeur, which both Russian and English combined would bring to bear against him and adopts strict neutrality as far as he can. I asked to be allowed to build a house for myself. I was met by a refusal, not from any spirit of unfriendliness, but with the open reason that seeing no orders had been received from the Persian Government that I was to come as a Consul permission to establish myself in a house could not be granted. Were it granted, the Amir explained, the Russian Consul would at once report him as acting contrary to custom, and at the dictation of the English. Bring me, he said, such orders as I have received about the Russian Consul and you shall build any house you please. To show the double side of his feelings he offered me his private garden as a camping ground where there were some trees, etc. So it comes that all we do to foster friendly relations does, no doubt, increase those feelings, but they are suppressed and do not show themselves by any partiality, or in any instance when the veto of the Russian power intervenes. Judged from Seistan, Russia by intrigue unscrupulously brings to grief any ruler or even subordinate who is not subject to this dictation of hers, and she backs up her intrigue by the force of arms menacing the long length of Persia’s northern border. Neither of these weapons can we employ. Our course is then to so fill up the cup of good will towards us that it may overflow and Persia may surprise the world by awaking from her charmed sleep. If we are ever to hope for this awakening we must give her a hundredfold more object lessons of our good will towards her than we have done. Let us by peaceful establishments of British Colonies set her an example. Let us accustom Persia to British officers surrounded by well ordered and regularly paid servants, not living with that lavish expenditure and outward show which is an evil of their own life. Let us supply her with all the means in our power with commodities sold by honest traders at honest prices, and let there be plenty of these. Let us encourage the Indian merchant to establish himself everywhere in Persia. Let us show that mere interchange of presents is no friendship, that Mudakhil and bribery are not healthy methods of profit and promotion, and we may yet hope to see the Persian rise superior to that fear of Russia which so numbs her life and thought. But if we are to give this policy, which I suggest, a fair trial, we must not delay, our policy must be continuous and our officers and traders must be numerous. I have already outstepped the limits of what an official diary should be with these suggestions, and I refrain from more than hinting that a bolder front to Russia would aid our scheme of spreading the influence of our lives over Persia. Seistan politics by themselves are not worthy of much attention at present, nor should they be able to upset in anyway schemes for regeneration of Persia or the establishment of our influence here as elsewhere in Persia, rather ami hopeful that Seistan, linked as I hope to see it still more to India, will be a Province where English example may have the most chance. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk Mi Akbar Khan is in Nusratabad and rules the country, his son Mohamad Reza Khan, late Deputy Governor and known as the Sarhang, occupies now a subordinate position, while MirMasum formerly Deputy Governor and known as the Sartip, is said to be returning herefrom iabbas, where he lately was deputy Governor. It is reported, I believe with truth, that the Province of Tabbas has been wrested from the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk and Amad-ul-Mulk appointed there. . There is no secret made in the bazaars here that the loss of Tabbas to the Amir has been caused by Russian intrigue, and I believe that this would only be in accordance with their policy of intrigue for the purpose of terrorizing the Amir 2i 3 Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and so retaining him in that state of fear so satisfactory to Russia. Of the Beluch Sardars who are settled and established in Seistan, Sardar Purdil Khan, whose friendly assurances, have been given to the various British officers visiting this country, still shows every sign of friendliness. Others I could mention who are the same. They, like their rulers, the Persians, have adopted the same tone of strict neutrality. These men are not imbued with that fear of Russia as much as the Governor is, but still they are from fear of the Amir himself frightened to show their natural partiality towards the English, for the Amir would consider any marked show of friendship on their part to us as either an intrigue against himself or else as being dangerous for his own interests. For, on the one hand, though he is himself very friendly with the English, his oriental nature would not allow him to think that English intrigue with them against him was not possible, and, on the other hand, he fears that the Russians m.ight bring him to trouble for allowing his Baluch Sardars, his subjects, to show any partiality towards either of the rival powers. Myself, I am not in doubt about the real friendly feelings of the Amir, nor am I in doubt about the same friendly feelings of the Beluch Sardars towards us, nor need the Amir think seriously that the English wish to alienate the Beluch Sardars from Persian rule. The attitude of the Russian Consul with regard to the Baluch Sardars is one of intrigue, he adopts the policy of trying to set one section of the Baluch Sardars against the others and so making additional weapons to terrorize the Amir Governor. The Mulla element is busy in petty intrigues, but, since intolerance is no longer possible, they have not their power to create much mischief. The Russian Consul is, therefore, at present occupied in shaping events in order to be able to be in a position to dictate to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and to deprive him of his country if he shows signs of resistance. His machinations are worked from Meshed, where everything is done to make the Rukn-ud-Daulah suspicious of the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk ; and for this purpose he has, as his Mirzabashi, a man whose father is said to be in the Rukn-ud- Daulah’s office as Sandukdar, a responsible position. He and his Mirzabashi, besides being intriguers are spies on the actions of the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and they are trying to work on the suspicions they have aroused in the mind of the Wall* at Meshed to prevent the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, from showing any partiality to the English here. Beyond this, the Russian Vice-Consul as an Agent for Russia, has som.e deeply hidden motive for exerting this influence, besides merely preventing us from en lightening the Persians and encouraging their friendship. This is harder to find out, but the following information may point to one motive. Sayad Abdul Kadir Barakzai, formerly Kardar at Herat, came into my camp and, through Shahzada Ahmad Mir Sadozai jamadar, to my escort, I obtained the following information from him. Although we have a news-writer at Herat, who has probably reported the same thing, I record what he told we. Abdul Kadir said that he had had to leave Herat in a hurry, leaving his family, as he heard the Amir wanted him at Kabul 1 He said that six months ago he had seen the Rus sian railway at Sheikh Junaid, that he had even seen it arrive at Chihl Dukhtaran on the actual border. That trains passed to that point on the line. He des cribed Sheikh Junaid as a small hill, “ tapa,” by which the railway passed ; that the tapa or hill had been made into a strong fort; that inside the hill excavations had been made, and a bazar, also roads, barracks and guns were all to be found inside. He draw the plan which was double storied. On the lower story, i.e., level with the plain outside, ran one broad road through the hill with a transverse road4 across ; on these roads were bazars and in the corner spaces were guns. The same roads were on the upper level and in place of bazars along th em were barracks. A centre shaft to the whole under ground constructions admitted light and air. Whether the railway went into the fort he could not say. On the railway works now in progress none but Russian subjects were being employed. All Afghan and Persian subjects had been dismissed. Gram and supplies were freely exported from Herat to the Russians at Child Dukhtaran. He had heard that there had been some disturbances on the border between thp Afghans and the Russians. I asked him what the Herat people thought of the near approach of the Russian railway ; he said that 9 months ago he was a member of a Majlis which sat at night at the instigation of one Said Eshan, a Russian emissary frorn Sheikh lunaid, and that at that meeting the direction and destination of the Russian- Herat railway was agreed upon, without dissent, and the following was^ the route agreed upon. From Chihl Dukhtaran to Doghi, Khaja Malal, Khaja Kasim, Guzerat and Herat. From there to Pahri, Karez Dasht, Andaru, Kihk Kah, Lash, to Nusratabad (Seistan). Betw r een Kilik Kah and Lash a tunnel would have to be made. The members of this Majlis were— Said Eshan Turcoman, Russian representative. Saad-ud-Din Khan Naib-ul-Hukumat, Herat. Faramurz Sipah Salar. Muhammad Akbar Khan, Barakzai Brigadier-General. Allahdad Khan, General (since dead) and himself (Sayad Abdul Kadii) He said the Russians had written to the Naib-ul-Hukumat about the same time requesting ( 1 ) that a railway to Herat should be allowed ; (2) permission to build a caravanserai; ( 3 ) that grain might be freely exported to their side of the border; ( 4 ) that Russian coinage should be allowed to circulate in Herat. The Naib*ul-Hukumat said he must refer these questions to Cabul, and the answer is unknown. The question of the currency was arranged in this way. Some years previously, Russian subjects (Jews from Bokhara, etc.) had settled in Herat with stories of oppression from the Russians. Under the direction of one Agha Ahmad Bakkal Meshedi these men, on pretence of being in extremes, petitioned to be allowed to exchange their Russian rouble notes and were allowed to, and so the circulation of Russian money in Herat was a fait accompli The strength of the Afghan troops in Herat is reported as follows 2 Regiments of cavalry, 600 each. Turk Sowars and Chahyar. 8 Battalions of infantry, 800 each. 2 Batteries of Horse Artillery. 90 Guns mounted. From these on detachment— 1 Cavalry detachment and 2 guns at Ghorian. f ' : ' 100 Khasadars at Kafir Kila and 400 Khasadars at Zulfikar. My informant’s news appeared to me to be true and interesting, so I have sent a friend of his to Herat to find out more; he may find out what a news-writer cannot.had reason to believe that the Russian Vice-Consul wanted the site on which my tent is pitched to build a consulate for himself. The Amir, whose friend ship increases with these private visits when I see him alone, again said it was difficult to allow me to build with no orders, but promised that under no circums tances should the ground on wffiich I had left my marks be given to the Russian Vice-Consul. He hinted that mud walls round tents and such tem porary structures could be erected which would not amount to a house, but would constitute a right of possession to any representative of the English who came here. I am now making arrangements to wall in my tents and collect bricks. As each post arrives from Birjand, I am in hopes of receiving some orders about my stay here, which has now nearly reached a month, and still more am I in continual hopes that the orders for my appointment may reach the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. If these arrive before I leave here, I should start building a house on site of my camp for a few hundred karans and so secure this site and land, surrounded as it is by irrigation channels, for the British representative, who I feel certain will be appointed here. The land, which is excellent soil, measures about 12 acres. 1 he Amir said in conversation that he had been deprived of Tabbas, owing, he said, to his being out-bidden by Amad-ul-Mulk. He maintained the neutral attitude by not hinting that it was through Russian intrigue, though I know he is known to think so. He said his son, the Sartip Mir Masum, late Governor of Tabbas, was coming here and was at Birjand. How long the Amir is going to stay here I cannot say, nor can I say whether, if he moves to Kain, he intends appointing the Sartip Mir Masum or the Sarhang Mohamad Raza Khan as Deputy Governor, the former would be the most popular. The Amir said that, if I wanted grain for Rabat, he could now sell me as much as I liked. I shall buy some and send it to Rabat. I have taken some trouble to cultivate frendly relations with the Amir at these private visits, where no one but ourselves are present, and I think with some success. We can, I think, feel assured about the friendly feelings towards us of the other notables and officials here, including the Beluch Sardars, and 1 have avoided making too much of them, fearing to rouse the suspicions of the Amir, and not wishing to allow myself to be a party to any local intrigue. I hope that, though I have not been here the whole month, I have carried out the orders required of me, and that any longer stay is of not much value, especially as the heat is very great. If I hear nothing from Colonel Temple the next post from Birjand, due on 3 rd May, I propose making arrangements to move there and make a stay of about 10 days, taking the Mission with me. Before leaving, I will send in a preliminary estimate with proposals for the establishment of a Vice-Consul here, and will do my best to secure my camp site for his house. I have just received news of an official representation made by the Russian Vice-Consul. He sent his Mirzabashi to the Serishtedar of the Amir Hashmat- ul-Mulk to make a formal complaint that until my arrival here he w r as treated with every respect, but that since my arrival he had been ignored and neglected, while every attention had been paid to me. As this representation is true, I hope.it may be considered a satisfactory result of my deputation. But I fear that if the Amur Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who is naturally inclined to be independent, departs in any way from his strict neutrality, he will incur the displeasure of the Russians and there will be work for the Meshed Consulate-General to prevent any evil falling on him. NuSRATABAD; | G. CHEKEVIX-TRENCH, Major, 7he April igoo. ) Her Britannic Majesty's Consul Seistan* 6 G. C. Press, Simla,—No. 326 F. D.— 4-6-1900.—31Diary of Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, No. 6, for the period 14 th to 25 th May 1900 . On the 14th May I left Nasratahad with the intention of making a tour of inspection towards the northern and eastern portion of Seistan. x y p was to move on to Birjand on the completion of my tour, where ia ^ ee:a ordered to go to for the summer by Colonel Temple, and since 1 had spen a full month in Seistan. At my first march out I received the orders of Government to remain in Seistan until relieved. I, therefore, carried out my plan of visiting the eastern border of Seistan and returned to Nasratabad on the 25th instant. My visit along this eastern border was to see for myself the actual course of the Helmand river to the Naizar, as I had heard that, owing to the river having changed its course about seven years ago, there existed some ambiguity about the clear definition of the border as laid down by Goldsmid. I also wished to follow the footsteps of Mr. Miller and gauge what influence he had acquired over the people of the border, a part of the country I had noticed he appeared to he turning his attention towards. The border country is known as the Mian Kangi district, so described because it lies between the old bed of the Helmand and the new course taken by that river. The land like all lands so situated was said to be most fertile, even more fertile than Seistan proper, and for this reason too I was anxious to see it for myself. In Major Brazier-Creagh’s report I found a map showing the present water- wavs of the Helmand and the Mian Kangi district. Though it is a rough map with few of the numerous villages entered in it, it forms an excellent ske c i by which I can explain the cause of the existing difference about. the Aighan- Seistan border. I attach a copy of the map with several additional villages entered, and I have shown the limit of the claims of either side. As I had no means of surveying the country, the position of the villages is only relative, though the whole area according to the scale given is approxi mately correct. It is at once apparent that, since the main waters of the Helmand now flow down the branches marked as Pariun and Dashak (especially the former), instead of by the more easterly bed, what a large a,rea of country becomes disputed territory, for the old bed can no longer be said to be the main course of the river, for it contains but little or no water north of Burj-i-As and Nad-i-Ali. The change in the main stream takes place at Milak, though there is nothing there to particularly account for nearly all the water being turned into the Pariun branch and almost entirely deserting its old bed. On enquiry I found that the change had been gradual and not sudden, and that the tendency of the river still was to desert the old bed and flow west ward. I now give the exact wording of the Goldsmid definition of the border, copied from his arbitral opinion, dated Tehran, 19th August 1872, so far as it concerns the eastern and northern borders of Seistan. “ The main bed of the Helmand, therefore, below Kohak should be the eastern boundary of Persian Seistan * * * * * * * * n ° rt k Seistan the southern limit of the Naizar should be the frontier towards Basil Juwain. Persia should not cross the Hamun (Naizar) in that direction. A line drawn from the Naizar to the Koh Siah (Black Mountain) near Bandan would clearly define her possessions”. It is easy from this clear definition to mark on the map what was the boundary meant, especially as there is now no question, both from existing2 evidence and from the general wording of Goldsmid’s arbitral opinion that the Helmand in 1872 flowed by what is now known as the old bed. I have marked in my map this boundary. I have taken Kurki as the place where the Helmand formerly became Hamun or ^Naizar 3 as this place was so described by the Persians to me. From there towards the Koh-i-Siah I have drawn my line. To turn now to what has happened since the river changed its course, and to the existing claims and rights of possession of the Seistanis and Afghans, both of whom base their claim on the wording of the arbitral opinion quoted. The Afghans claim that, since the river has changed its course, their boundary has followed it and now includes the Mian Kangi district, and I believe that they would, with their superior strength, have probably taken forcible possession of this part had not the rirer still flowed for a short distance along its old bed, and was not still a goodly stream to the immediate front of their commanding fort at Nad-i-Ali. The Persians, on the other hand, claim, as it is to their benefit, that the change of the course of the river does not affect the original decision, and that, as the old course is still traceable, it is, as before, their boundary, while they have accordingly continued their possession up to that old river bed. The Persians following this river bed, which towards the north is completely dry, have found that it does not any longer lead to Hamun or Naizar, for the water of the Helmand which made the Hamun having taken a more westerly course, the Hamun or Naizar has conformed and shifted too to the west. So the point from where Goldsmid drew his line for his northern border, viz.^ Kurki, is no longer the spot where the Helmand becomes Naizar. Here then is an opportunity for an extension of territory and an evasion of the arbitral opinion. As though still in search of a Naizar, the Persians have extended their line of frontier from the old bed as far as Takht-i-Shah, a piece of rising ground, stopping only there as being a respectful distance from Lash Juwain and Afghan cultivated soil. Having reached Takht-i-Shah with their claimed boundary, they tell you their northern boundary is from some point there (not exactly known) to Tapakaru, a convenient hill on the northern limit of the Hamun, and on from there to Siah Koh. Here then is a boundary dispute of some importance, for the land claimed is valuable and water is abundant. The Persian claim I am able to state rather more definitely than the Afghan claim, though I conclude the Afghan claim would start from Milak and extend to Gala Kulak, where the main water of the Helmand does actuallv become Hamun, and they would consider a line drawn from there to Siah Koh as being according to the arbitral opinion of Goldsmid. Anyhow the loss to the Afghans by the change of the course of the Helmand is considerable, for from Burj-i-As northwards they can get no water from the river, the Persians owning both actual banks. I say Burj-i-As and not Milak because, as before stated, some w^ater does still run by the old bed as far as that place. Having now explained the opposing claims of the Persians and Afghans over this portion of their boundary, I will narrate my tour and what I saw of actual possession in this Mian Kangi district, and what I noticed of Russian influence and fertility of the country. Russian Leaving Nasrambad X marched to Burj-i-Afghan. From there I took a light camp of one tent, and with my baggage on ponies I crossed the Itud-i- Dashak to Jalalabad, an old fort on a rising piece of ground and virtually an island, hrom Jalalabad I made my way across water swamps to the ed^-e of the river, really the mam water of the Helmand, but known as the Pariun FYom here I crossed in Tutins or reed boats to Margon. The passage of the river at tins season of the year when the river is so full is not easy The Stream runs with force and the river is not confined to banks, but flows throm-h3 high tamarisk jungle and may he nearly a mile of water. The Persians took the ponies and horses over. Sometimes swimming them and sometimes wading and splashing through the tamarisk trees. I took several photographs of the “ Tutins ” and horses crossing which I hope will be successful. All the baggage and ponies were safely landed at Margon, a small Baluch village of wattle and mud huts. From Margon I went to Palgai and on to Deh Agha Muhammad Khan, similar villages. In all these villages I was received in a more than friendly spirit. As it was very hot, I was dependent on their hospitality to allow me to occupy one of their huts during the day when these people all came and visited me. They were quite unaccustomed to seeing a Sahib. At Margon they had seen the Itussian Consul, but he had not come among them. With me they were quite free and gave me great accounts of the duck shooting in the winter. From Deh Agha Khan I rode out and back to Takht-i-Shalq and from there was able to understand the position of the rival claims to the Mian Kangi district which I have described. I found all the people well versed in these claims, and as they are easily understood I avoided being too inquisitive about the boundary. The people were vaguely interested in Russian and English rivalries, and asked if I met the Russian Consul in a friendly way, whether it was true the English were going to take Seistan. I had many opportunities of explaining the raison d'etre of my being in Seistan at all, and how the opening of the road to Quetta would benefit every one in Seistan. They were quite aware of the coming change to their country, and it seemed to he the ambition of most of them to visit Quetta one day. In Palgai and Deh Agha Muhammad, I found dyers who had been to Quetta to buy indigo and who were full of the benefits of the road. One man bought rupees from me as he was going to Quetta again he said. I found the people very pleasant, offering everything they had for sale at reasonable prices. Having seen enough of the frontier to understand the position, I avoided making my return journey to Milak by the actual Afghan frontier along the old bed of the river, and marched through the centre of the Mian Kangi district by Siadak to Deh Jehangir and to Milak. Here I was much struck by the extraordinary quantity of grain being at the time reaped and the general richness of the soil. I found that the Persians were busy in making new canals from the right bank of the Pariun or present bed of the Helmand, to water the lands which were now dry, and which were formerly watered from the left bank of the Helmand. The Nahr-i-Surhang and Sartip were two large canals in progress, the Nahr-i-Surhang extending right up to Takht-i-Shah, the least rightful property of the Persians. This part of the country would be a grand place for duck shooting and the people would be delighted to see any Sahib. I believe that it would be quite the fault of some one in the Sahib’s camp if civility and supplies were not forthcoming. At Burj-i-Mir Gul I found Mr. Miller had a newswriter, but I was nevertheless well received. At Milak I found a Baluch headman decidedly inclined to be uncivil. Ho said that the Russian Consul paid his Baluchis better than I did and gave them more presents, &amp;c. He also asked why if we paid the Amir of Afghanistan and he was our servant, we did not make use of his country to run our road through, and why our rupee did not weigh the same amount as the number of krans which were current exchange. A lecture on the institution of gold monometalism4 into India, in Persian, tried me rather high, and I doubt if he was the wiser though he said he was. These questions were probably the outcome of Mr. Miller’s conversations. At Milak I crossed the river. All the Tutins (reed boats) which had been made ready for the liussian Consul had been cut up. As I had, however, with me Saiyid Khan, one of the most influential Baluchis, I soon found more, and the episode w r as put down to ct Shaitani” on the part of Pasancl Khan, Baluchi, the Bussian Vice-Consul’s Baluch adherent. These small signs of Bussian influence mean very little and Mr. Miller, though he undoubtedly is doing his best to acquire more influence, has as yet been in no way successful. I do not, however, approve of his having any influence at all over Baluchis, and am determined to prevent it. I have written separately asking to be supplied with 5 Baluch sowars from Quetta who could go among the Baluchis here, speak their language and extol British rule. My letter also contains other suggestions for attracting and retaining these Baluch border men. I found the Persians through the whole Mian Kangi district very afraid of the Afghans, who they said constantly robbed their ponies and raided them. I am glad I avoided going too close to the border, or asking too many questions about the border, as I found my visit did raise some suspicion among the Afghans on the border and any contretemps would have been bad. On the whole my tour was, I hope, useful. I was able to make friends with several influential men, who have since been in here to see me and who will keep me informed of what is going on. I found Munshi Ahmad Din and Shahzada Ahmad Mir of the escort very useful in making friends with the people. The latter being a Sadozai Afghan is always useful when I have any dealings with Afghans. My remaining in Seistan wall have an excellent effect. I find on my return that great pressure is being brought to bear on the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk to pay the higher equivalent in cash for his grain dues to the Wall of Meshed. The extra pressure on the Amir is having the effect of making him screw the people more, and the local Chiefs ,are showing signs of objecting and of causing friction. The Amir shows still greater hostility to Mr. Miller to whom, as I have said, he attributes his troubles. The Amir has made all the workmen building additions to Mr. Miller’s house leave, and Mr. Miller who was dining with me last night complained of it and said he had so much difficulty in these matters. He looks with envy on my small building in course of erection and is astonished that I have no trouble at all. Mr. Miller has now reported the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to Meshed. The whole game is merely to get him ousted and a Bussian nominee in here. I am writing to Colonel Temple to ask him to try and get the Mustophi Khalik Khan, the emissary sent by the Wali from Meshed here, to screw the Amir, removed. I can easily supply stories to his discredit. If we could o-et him away, the Amir would be able to rule in peace again and continue doing what we want. ° I have just heard from Saiyid Khan, Baluchi, that he has completed a °ood thana with fortified towers at Girdi between this and Bobat, and that he has sunk wells at two places on the same section of the road where they were much wanted, and is building shelters near them similar to those on the Nushki- Bobat section. The Amir here knew we were building these places, but offered no opposition. With these the road wall be completed as regards shelter and thanas to Nasratabad. I will report more fully about them when all are completed.The Amir has given Seth Suleiman, the Quetta merchant here, leave to build a shop and house anywhere lie likes and will give the land free. Rumours reach me that the Russians having taken over the entire customs of Persia will have a customs house here. I also hear thai, tne English Government will take over the irrigation and revenues ot beistan. The second is, I am afraid, too good to he possible in Persia. Naseataead ; (Sd.) G. Chenevix-Trench, Major, The 25th May 1900. ) Her Majesty's Consul for Seistan. Foreign Office Press— No. 14.04—28-6*00—92.v Diary No 7 of Major G. Chenevix-Trencli f jyk!t -f 1 l^rajesty’s Consul for Seistan, for the period 26th May to 10th June 1900. My preceding diaries have taken the form of a narrative, rather than a journal of daily events in Seistan. This was purposely done, as, believing I was to be here only for one month, I was anxious to convey not alone the course of daily events, but also my first impressions of this country with an account of its poutics and its people in connection with its commercial and strategical value. As I have now been ordered to prolong my stay here until relieved, I have become, i understand, merely the first of a series of British officers, who will for the future represent British interests in the province of Seistan. The form therefore of my diary will be a detailed account of the actual daily events occurring here under dates given. In addition there will be under head ing “ General remarks a continuous report of the trend of events here, outside my own particular province. I he narrative of various subjects under general re marks will be continued in each diary so as to form a progress report of the poli tics and events of Seistan and even of Khorasan, in so far as they affect British influence both here and in the more interior portion of Persia. Diary of daily events. 26th May. —Mr. Miller, the Russian Vice-Consul, dined with me. 27 th May. —Sunday, 28th May. —Mr. Miller came over to my camp in the evening. The heat and loneliness of Seistan seemed to oppress him He has several small troubles, such as the desertion of his labourers employed on his house building which apparently weigh heavily on his mind. 2gth May .—I sent Mr. Miller a formal invitation to dinner on the 2nd June, the date I had fixed for celebrating the birthday of Her Majesty the Queen. J J 30 th Received my weekly post from Meshed. The post contained a copy of foreign Office telegram calling for a report on the alleged aggressions ot the Persians on their eastern border, bounded as it is by the course of the Helmund, which in this part marks the division of territory between Afghanistan ana i crsia* A full report with map of the country and border under dispute been sent with my diary No. 6 for period 15th May to 25th May. sent to the Consul-General at Meshed to that effect. had already A reply was The same post brought me a letter of introduction from Colonel Temnle for one Saiyad Hosain Khan, who was shortly going to visit Seistan in connec tion with collection of customs under the orders of Mr. Kastaigue (Belgian) Director of Customs for Khorasan. v ^ 3, st May. 'Paid an evening visit to Mr. Miller. He was pleased with the improvements and additions he had made to his house, which he said he had ac comphshed with so much obstruction and trouble. istjnne.—x paid a private visit to the Amir Hashmat-ul Mulk It was my first visit since my return on recall. He was as usual very friendly and cor- diah I explained to him that it was our custom to celebrate’the anniversary of the Queen s birthday with all the show and ceremony which circumstances admit, and said that, after receiving in the morning official visits from the Russian Vice-Consul and I concluded from him, I pronosed havino- o USblai ] sports.,, the evening followed by fireworks. S ^mkhana and I had heard before that, as this month was still a month of mourning for the murder of Imam Husain, fireworks and the galloping of horses was not approved of. A ;I found on sounding the Amir that this objection did not carry much weight with him, as he had already summoned all the Sardars of the country with their cavalry to attend the show. Out of deference, however, for public feeling I asked him to counter-order these Sardars, and arranged that the sports and fireworks should take place at the end of the period of mourning, when the rejoic ing could be more mutually shared by his people and mine. This concession was very gratifying to him, and the show, when it does take place, will be more brilliant and the better attended. Since this conversation I have received a message from the head Mujtahid saying that he would like to grace the show in company with the Amir and his son, the Sarhang, provided there were no beating of drums. 2nd June .—It had been arranged that, though the sports and fireworks were postponed, the official visits should take place at 7-30 A M. Therefore Mr. Miller, accompanied by six Cossacks and his Persian staff, rode over in full dress to present their congratulations. The cossacks on arrival formed a line with my Afghan sowars, and together we gave a royal salute to the big Union Jack which was flying for the occasion. Mr. Miller afterwards paid the usual visit of ceremony, and the cossacks were entertained with tea, etc. The sight of 16 (Jacob’s Horse) Pathans drawn up in line with Russian cossacks giving a royal salute has not probably frequently been seen. Later the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk arrived in state to present his congratula tions. Full uniform was w T orn by myself and the escort, the latter escorting the Amir back to the Ark or the Fort. In the evening Mr. Miller dined with me. He is a very well informed and pleasant companion, but openly despondent about being in Seistan, and has several times hinted that he does not know whether he can endure the life much longer, and even that the Consulate itself may be withdrawn. 3rd June .—As I was riding alone through the city, I came on Mr. Miller making a sort of royal procession followed by cossacks and mounted Farashes, etc., distributing copper coins to the beggars. As I ride through town so often, and every one salaams and knows me so well, I think Mr. Miller’s unusual outing was a form of counteraction, and he must have been much disconcerted when I joined the procession and received the salaams of the people while he distributed the copper coins. The weather was intensely hot, a scorching sun and no wind. 4th June .—Munshi Ahmad Din received a message from Mr. Miller’s Mirza asking that their Farashbashi should not be received with so much honour when he accompanied Mr. Miller on his visits to me. It is the custom in camp here to give tea and smoke to all such visitors. I gather Mr. Miller thinks the attractiveness of our camp a temptation to his followers. In the evening the sow r ars invited the cossacks to an evening meal. The singing and dancing kept up for some time afterwards was proof of very friendly feelings existing. 3th June .—Weather very oppressive and hot. 6th June. —Mr. Miller dined with me. I asked him what he knew about the rumours of the Russians having crossed the Afghan frontier towards Herat. He implied he knew nothing, but I gathered he did know something, as before* when the question had been discussed, he always jeered at the idea and said had been a bazaar rumour ever since he had been an official in the East. He did though remark that the country from Herat south, though generally sup posed to be so adapted for railway construction, was not officially reported to be so. yth June. During the night a windstorm blew with such force as to make sleep quite impossible. Some of the tents too suffered. The wind here is so continuous and strong that new tents brought with me already show signs of 23 shreding. This wind was said to be the Sad-o-bist roz wind, but I have been so frequently before told the same that I am becoming sceptical. The force and continuance of it, however, makes me think it is the renowned wind of 120 days. Tent life during this period is impossible, besides being very trying to the nerves. My small mud rooms are just finished, and I am able to shelter myself comfortably in them. The wind itself is cool and pleasant if properly regulated with badgirs. 8th June .—Post from Quetta arrived. Munshi Ahmad Din visited the Mos- tophi Khalik Khan referred to in my diary No. 6. An account of his conversa tion will be found under general remarks. General Remarks. Spread of British influence in Seistan. There is no doubt that the people of Seistan have now 7 become quite accus tomed to the presence of a British officer. I think w r e may dispel from our minds that the Seistanis are any longer suspicious of our actions in this country. T here is no doubt that my frequent conversations w'ith the people in their own language has done much to allay any feelings of this sort. The accessibility of myself and my camp to these people has had a good effect on them. Other circumstances have had their share in bringing about what I can only term the very friendly feelings of all classes of the people. I may mention the postpone ment of the gymkhana and fireworks mentioned above, the prompt payment for all supplies for the camp and most of all the daily payment to coolies employed in making bricks, and in building the mud huts for myself and followers, etc. The prestige of the British has been enhanced by the sustained efforts to improve the communication between India and Seistan by the announcement that my appointment is now a permanent one, that the British flag, camp and buildings have occupied the most imposing site near the capital, that a British flag on a high staff flies all and every day, that every one who works under the flag receives the reward of his labour, that in and round the camp improvements in some form are always being carried out, such as a riding school for the cavalry, a small race-course with jumps, roads, paths, etc. The frequent interchange of visits between myself and the Amir, and his marked attitude of friendliness, both before me and at his private Darbars, have given the people a confidence in all dealings from this camp. It is an interesting sight to see the engagement of the 20 odd coolies for building, and the rush there is to be first to arrive so as to get employment. A number of Seistanis petitioned me the other day that they should be employed before Hazaras who, they said, had no claims on me as they had. These workmen, earning some and some J of a karan, come from long distances and carry back to their homes praises of our dealings. The result is we want for nothing, and our payments are not above the market rates. I have bought 5 or 6 ponies here. They are very cheap, averaging about Rs. 60 each, and every evening some form of horse dealing goes on in the camp. All this coming and going is having a very good effect on the people, and the influence spreads to all the villages, w 7 here I find I am equally well received. When out of Nusratabad, I always have a small Union Jack carried on a lance on a light pole by one of my sowars, so that the flag may become known and be a symbol of friendliness and justice. Mr. Miller has not the same advantages. He has no trade, no frontier co-terminous, no town like Quetta, within reach of the ordinary Seistani. His house built in the middle of the town is as difficult of ingress as a fort.4 To pass a Persian guard, a cossack guard and through two doors does not induce a friendly intercourse with the people. His servants (a class on whom depends so much the reputation of the Sahib) are Persians from Meshed and not above Mudakhil. One of them created a great uproar round the Consulate by his intrigues with a woman in the town, and Mr. Miller told me he had been greatly annoyed by the event, besides having to pay hush-money. I he people and the Mullas remember that the last Russian had to leave owing to similar troubles with women. His cossacks too have offended public feelings by bathing daily in the canal in a state of nature. Mr. Miller is no horseman and seldom leaves his house, and is in conse quence less known to the people than I am. His method of obtaining influence over the people is to send his Mirza wdth a direct invitaiton to some one of influence, and this invitation is more often refused than otherwise. « The Amir too but seldom visits him, and plainly declares in Darbar that the Russian presence is not desirable here. There is sn idea abroad that I am a Con c ul-General from Meshed, and this rank has not been unnoticed by the people when making comparisons with the Russian. Mr. Miller, I think, is conscious of the minor part he plavs in Seistan, but rests all his hopes on ultimate success by the idea of the superior influence his countrymen have at Tehran and Meshed. The Eastern Persian Afghan border. —Nothing has taken place on this border relating to alleged aggressions of the Persians towards Afghan territory. Increased demand by the Persian Govern?nent on Seistan revenues .— This is a matter which grows in importance and materially affects the future of Seistan. In my diary No. 6 I mentioned the advent of Mostophi Khtlik Khan who had come here from Meshed for the express purpose of forcing the Amir to pay a higher revenue to the Persian Government. The Mostophi’s attitude towards me on his arrival was one of open opposi tion. His actions here were not calculated to improve the condition of Seistan so far as they affected our interests. He was, I knew, supported by the Russians, and I in consequence mistrusted him and would have been glad to have seen him removed. On my return on recall I found that, though he had refrained from visiting me, he had paid lengthy visits to Mr. Miller. At the same time through various channels I received overtures from him that he wished to be in favour with me. A visit was arranged. I arraigned him openly for having neglected me, and reminded him that as a Kizilbash refugee he had found an asylum at Lahore and had been in the confidence of Sir Lepel Griffin. The visit was a success, and whether as a result of that or not, or whether he sees now the paramount influence we have in Seistan, he has openly declared himself a friend. He is now prepared to show me the original letters from the Rukn-ud-Daulah and explain his mission. Munshi Ahmad Din paid him a visit, and the Mostophi showed by his con versation what his opinions were of our position here and mentioned how our camd, occupying a site capable of any extension, quite dominated every thing here. In explaining his mission he showed that he was in the confidence of the Rukn-ud- Daulah and had been sent to Seistan to make as heavy a demand in cash from the Amir as he could, and now at present he was negotiating on the point. He said that should the Amir seriously refuse to come to any agreement, which he did not believe he would, the RuLmud-Doulah would turn him out of Seistan,L d m ?5 t ^' c h u U , gh Se,stan was b y custom an hereditary right to the Mir Alum a iah was no l t P re P are( l t0 accept this view, and to dispossess teh Amir would be an easy task. The Mostophi added that the Rukn-ud-DouIah’s claims were excessive, while the amount agreed to by the Amir was unreasonably small. He said he hoped to effect a compromise, as personally he would be sorry to see the Amir dispossessed. 3 The question of enhancement of revenue tax or ' liarah ” on Seistan is a sword of Damocles over this country, and it will be well to see that the weapon does not tall into the hands of our rivals, and so enable them to remove a friendly Amir tor one bound more to their interests. NuSRATABAD ; Thj 4 th June 1900 . I G. CHENEVIX-TRENCH, Major, Her Majesty's Consul for Seistan, G. C. Press, Simla.—No, 554 F D,—16-7-1900.—31i Diary No. 8 of Major G. Chenevix Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan for period nth June to 25th June 1900. nth June .—I started the 12 riding camels, which I had bought for my depu tation, to Quetta. These camels were no longer of any use to me here, as Seistan itself is a country over which the camel travels with difficulty on account of the numerous water canals. The camels too suffer during the summer here from the swarms of mosquitoes. The Seistanis remove all their camels from the fiat coun try to surrounding hills and elsewhere during the spring and early summer and not a single camel can be hired. These camels, which I have sent back to Quetta, are Government property, and should arrive there in time to be of use to the officer who will relieve me and so save Government having to buy others. Called on the Mustophi, Khalik Khan, to return his visit to me. My visit was private and confidential. He assured me of his great intimacy with the Wali Rukn-ud-Doulah at Meshed and even the Shah, and said he was in their confidence and had before been used on missions to report on the state of various provinces. A full report of my conversation with him will be found under general remarks. In the evening the head Mujtahid, Haji Ismail, a man of great influence here, sent his servant to ask after my health. This overture from the head Mullah was significant as I have not since I have been here paid much attention to the Mullah element, but now that they begin to pay me respect I will encourage their advances. I said that on return from my tour I would be glad to come and visit him at whatever time was convenient. Received a visit from Nawab Hossain Bakhsh, who with a party numbering 56 had come from Multan and was going to Meshed. He had left his party of followers, women and children, at Hussainabad, 16 miles from here, and had come to see me alone. He is an Honorary Magistrate at Multan and since he. was accompanied by so large a number of people, I was interested to hear his opinion of the route and how he had fared. I think he put the road to rather a severe test. I found that he and nearly all the party had chosen this the hottest time of the year to travel, that none had ridden horses or camels. All had sat in kajawas on the camels, and as there were too many of the party to be accommodated by the small shelter huts, they had camped at each place in the sun, women and children alike. I.cannot say that the Nawab was enthusiastic on the comforts of the road. He said nearly ail the wells hao had water and even complained of unevenness of the road, which, he said, made travelling in kajawas dangerous ! He hoped, he said, the Government would make a smoother road and showed me a lon^ report he had written on the defects. r I w ? as glad to hear from him that he had found no trouble about supplies since he had entered Seistan ; he said he might as well be in India, that every one' helped him and were most friendly. As I was leaving in the evening for Daulatabad near Hussainabad on tour I said I would see him and his part) there. Left Nusratabad for Daulatabad. 13th June.—kl Daulatabad I paid a visit to Sardar Purdil Khan Sarbandi. This sardar plays a striking part in Seistan politics, his friendly feelings towards all sahibs has often been brought to notice. In conversation he spoke much of his admiration for Sir 0 . St. John, whom he met when he was with his uncle, Taj Muhammad, in Kandhar. .His expression of loyalty towards the English and of contempt for the “ Kajars ” is almost embarrassing as he emphasises his British inclination by enlarging in open Darbar on the disqualifications of Mr. Miller and expresses his resentment that the Russians are represented in Seistan at all.He gives you the idea of a disappointed man. He has no feelings of loyalty towards Persian rule and cannot become a British subject. He says it was his bad luck that we abandoned Kandhar, where he would have served us under Sir O. St. John. The conversations of both himself and those of his attendants who were formerly servants to Sir O. St. John about the events which occurred previous to the battle of Maiwand were interesting. In the evening I was surprised to receive a visit from the stationma-ter of Multan. He was one of the party of Nawab Hussain Bakhsh. He had travelled comfortably by the road he said and was astonished to find the Seistanis so well disposed towards his party. 14th June .—Left Daulatabad for Sekoha, the ancient captial of Seistan, now situated on the southern border which adjoins the unwatered tract lying between Seistan proper and Koh-i-Malik Slab. The town is semi-deserted and mud in decay. On my way I visited the Nawab’s party at Husainabad. A more unsuitable collection of people for such a journey I could not have imagined—old women, children and men of poor physique all from the heat of Multan and all' probably going to face a winter in Meshed. They seemed quite happy and well supplied with everything by the Persians. The reason which made them stay at Husainabad and not come into Nusratabad is that there is no accommodation here, and a caravanserai is much wanted ; second, Nusratabad is about 8 miles off the direct Meshed road in winter and more so in summer when there is water in the Naizar; and third, the road by Nusratabad crosses numbers of canals unbridged and deep over which the camels cannot carry a load without danger. When the trade by this route develops, it would be inconvenient if the traders avoided the capital and the Consul by 8 miles, and I am considering whether I cannot induce the Amir to bridge the canals to Nusratabad so that the caravaans may come in here at any rate during the winter. If I could accomplish this and get a caravanserai built somehow it would be a great convenience to the trader. iSthJune.— 'Leit Sikoha for Burj-i-Kohna. On my way I entered into conversation with the villagers en route. I found that the new customs regu lations which are to be enforced later were disturbing them a good deal. I am not yet in a position to say what these new regulations are, but I assured them that no taxes would be levied on them if they brought goods from India other than the 5 per cent, ad valorem agreed to by treaty. Of course they w T ere quite ignorant of usual customs dues and only argued that formerly there were no taxes into Seistan and that now they would be forgetting that Seistan formerly was not a place of egress. If the Seistan does not get to India to fetch his indigo, I hope it will only be a greater inducement to the Indian traders to carry their trade to Seistan. iCth June .—Left Burj-i-Kohna for Deh Khoja Ahmad. Khoja Ahmad is situated on the broad canal which leads the water of the Helmund from Kohak bund to Seistan. The canal is about 50 yards wide at that place. The day was very hot in camp. In the evening I rode six miles to see the Bund-i-Seistan. The account given of this bund in General Goldshmid’s narrative of Eastern Persia is very different to what it was when 1 saw it. They describe it in February as a bund which extended across the Helmund completely turns the entire water into the artificial channel of the canal. In June when I visited it the bund appeared to me to have very little effect at all on the course of the Helmund. I saw a mass of entwined tamarisk branches apparently on the level of the low banks and extending only as far as the waterof the Helmund. The bund so called looked more like a means of training a portion only of the water, as the water which flowed down the canal did not even touch the artificial bund, but was directed by sandbanks which had formed above the bund. The canal which now as then is about 50 yards wide appears not to affect the main stream of the Helmund which was flowing like a mighty river of 150 yards wide towards Milak and the north. I was afterwards told by Mir Abbas of Eskel, who is very conversant with everything in.Seistan, that the bund was no longer a necessity, and that the chan nel of the Seistan canal was now so deep that it would naturally draw off as much water as was wanted. In any case the great bund which creates the water-supply for all Seistan is very disappointing as a sight and does not raise the actual level of the water an inch. ijth June .—Left Khoja Ahmad for Eskel where I was glad to make the acquaintance of one of the most important men in Seistan. He, like all the leading men in Seistan, is very glad to be in favour with the British representative, and as the day was very hot and the wind scorching, I was glad to take refuge in his Mehman Khana. Mir Abbas is a man full of information and ready to enlighten you on any point about Seistan. He is a great collector of old coins and stones, which men bring him from the ruined cities near. He gave me some coins and showed me with great pride some large crystal heads, rings and seals which he carried with him. I told him they were crystals, but 1 found afterwards he was grievously disappointed as he fully believed he was in possession of enormous diamonds and am glad to say thought I was very ignorant. Mir Abbas has several good humoured fat sons. His younger brother, about 29 years old, a fine intelligent looking youth, was very anxious, he said, to be employed in Quetta; he said he could produce ten sowars and asked me whether I thought he would be accepted. Mir Abbas was in great distress about his daughter who he said, w’as posses sed by a devil. He asked whether my Shia Sayad Munshi I had with me would come and exorcise the devil, The Munshi was sent for and told me he hoped for good results from his visit. 18th June .—Returned to Nusratabad after an absence of six days. In the evening I was told that Mr. Miller had been much upset by having had a packet of letters stolen from his house. The letters were written by the Russian new’s-wnter in Mian Kangi on the border and w r ere destined for Meshed. The usual reports were made to me that Mr. Miller suspected us of the robbery of which, of course, we are innocent. igth June. —Mr. Miller dined. In the course of conversation he said he had sent an invitation to young Russian guardsmen to come and shoot in the winter in Seistan. I think the British subaltern is more likely to be here before the Russian guardsmen. 21 st June .—I received news that my postman between this and Birjand had cause of complaint against their treatment by the people. I wrote to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk and represented the facts and asked him to prevent such occurrences. 22nd June .—Birjand post arrived. Heard from Colonel Temple who said he had seen the Rukn-ud-Uaulah on the subject of the visit of the Mustophi Khalik Khan. He said as the matter was delicate and the course adopted by the Wali to extract revenue was that usually adopted in Persia ; he had not donet^ore than express a hope that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk would be leniently deilt with. I am glad that he took no stronger action under the altered attitude of the Mestophi towards me. Colonel Temple said that there were no grounds in Mushed for thinking the Russians had in any w’ay encouraged these demands, which I am glad to hear. I received by the same post a letter from Ghulam Jilani, the Hospital Assis tant, together with one frem the Sartip Mir Mansum Khan. The Sartip writes to say he hopes I will do for him what he has explained to Ghulam Jilani and which Ghulam Jilani has written in his letter. » The Sartip makes a formal request that I will use my influence with the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to bring about a complete reconciliation between him and the Sardars Said Khan and Jehan Khan with his father, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. This I think shows that the Sartip has great confidence in my influence over the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and is significant as showing the inclination of the Sartip and the two sardars who being in the pay and under the influence of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk might be supposed to have leanings towards Russia. Ghulam Jilani further reports that the sartip has received a letter from the Mustophi telling him he will support his (the Sartip’s) claim to Seistan against his father, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, I conclude in the event of the latter refusing to come to terms. As Ghulam Jilani is attending the Sartip for his eyes and is, he says, on very friendly terms, his report may be true. I shall send an answer to the Sartip assuring him of friendly feelings, but I shall not hold out a hope of any direct interference in what is after all the private affair of the Amir. There is every chance of the Sartip returning to Seistan, and I am confident that I shall make friends with him as 1 have been able to do with his father and his brorher. 23rd June .—Paid a visit to Haji Ismail Mujtahid. Although the Russian Vice-Consul had paid a formal visit on arrival here to the mullah, 1 have not paid any great deference to the mullahs of Seistan since I came, preferring rather that they should know more about me from the people before meeting me. My visit to the head Mujtahid was a great pleasure to me. I found him to be a very fine old man. He spoke clearly and with much power and intelligence. He asked whether w r e were going to have a railway here. I said the railway certainly had a knack of following in the wake of the sahib. He extolled the fertility of Seistan and said he know of a village now deserted and dry where several maunds of rose leaves were collected for otto of rose. He then proceeded to give me a lecture on his faith and expressed astonishment that the English people so fair in their dealings should not be followers of Prophet. He asked how many times I said my prayers every day and how it was that I could speak Persian so easily ; to what part of Persia I had been, etc. The visit was a success and I hope I have secured another important friend in Seistan. General Remarks. Spread of British influence in Seistan. The progress of British influence continues to be satisfactory. The conduct of the escort consisting of Pathans from the Bannudistrict has been good. They appear to get on well with the Persians who freely wander in their lines sellina them eggs, melons, etc. tS The rationing of the men and horses which at first was attended with a little difficulty now gives no troub e. The Seistani lands his bhusa and grain in camp and sells it at moderate rateu. I have never had a complaint since I have been here for non-payment of supplies. The price of everything has come down considerably since we came here, showing greater confidence in us ,4Though 1 have been building huts to shelter the party, which easily might have roused suspicions or excited the opposition of the ill-disposed, 1 have never heard it expressed that our action is anything but popular. That one of the buildings is a small mosque for the use of the Muhammadans in the camp has quite astounded the people and seems to be a comfirmation to them that we deal fairly. I hope I am not drawing too highly coloured a picture of our popularity here, but it is so openly expressed on the part of the people and we are so well looked after and provided for that I don’t think I am mistaken. Mr. Miller seems to have succumbed to the heat and to have taken up a position of, 1 hope, annihilation. He has not been popular lately as he himself has now taken to bathing in a state of nature with his cossaks. I often meet him. He is very pleasant and broadminded. He carries no political bias into social life. The Eastern Persian Afghan border. A rumour reaches me that the Afghans have cultivated on the Persian side of the Goldshmid border, on this side of the old bed of the Helmund river (please see map attached to Diary No. 6). They are reported to be making a canal from a village called Bahlol (not marked in the map referred to but close to Deh Dost Muhammad and on the old bed of the Helmund river on the Afghan side) towards Takht-i-Shah and to have been ordered by the Aimr to continue their work against all opposition. As the Nahir*i-Sarhang, which I saw under construction was also directed towards Takht*i-Shah from the Persian side, there is likely to be some friction between the Persian and Afghans if both coutinue their operations. The Sarhang Muhammad Raza Khan has himself gone to Mian Kangi district. When travelling in that part I promised several people that Abbas Ali, Hos pital Assistant, should visit the country and attend to sick cases which were brought to me. I have thought this a good opportunity to send him there, and he left here on the 21st June for a tour of ten days. He will report fully w’hat is going on. Increased demand by the Persian Government on Seistan revenues. In private and confidential conversation with Mustophi Khalik Khan I explained forcibly to him that whatever might be the claims of the Rukn-ud-Daulah against the Hashmat-ul-Mulk for revenue, it was to the interest of Persia and the Rukn-ud-Daulah himself that no change of Governor should take place in Seistan. I said that any change of Governor would create disturbance here and seeing that Seistan had now come under the eye of rival powers, it was wiser to have things as they were under hereditary rulers, than to start a succession of rulers here at each of whose appointment both Russia and England would have something to say, while the ukn-ud-Daulah himself would probably not find a newly appointed Governor any more amenable to paying enhanced revenue than the present man who would be sure to do all he could to meet the wishes of the Rukn-ud-Daulah to protect his hereditary rights. The Mustophi was agreeable to this reasoning and said that he was an old friend of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and he would do his best to come to some arrange ment. I impressed on him that the English were resolved on developing the Seistan trade route and advised him not to act contrary to their interests or to advise the Rukn-ud-Daulah to do so. The Mustophi asked me whether I could buy grain from him, as he said the Amir could only pay him in kind and the Rukn-ud-Daulah wanted cash. He offered to sell me 15,000 Indian maunds of grain, at 1 maund 14 seers (Indian weight) a rupee for barley and 27 Indian seers a rupee for wheat I said while I was quite willing to oblige him were I could, such an enormous quantity of grain would be as useless to me as it was to him, and that even if we wanted to fill up our godowns on the Nushki route, it would only be a few hundred maunds we 5should require. 1 took the Opportunity of explaining to him that the only remedy for realizing on this enormous surplus supply of grain in Seistan was to encourage traders who would buy and leave money in the country, thus facilitating in the future any increased demand for money which the Rukn ud-Daulah might make. The effect of this second conversation with the Mustophi has been to make him more inclined to make friends with me, and though I am not prepared to trust him very fatj I hope he may be of use. He has since sent several messages to ask after me and to arrange a meeting. Immediately after visiting the Mustophi I saw the Amir in private. I told him I had seen the former and had advised him to come to some understanding and gave the same advice to the Amir. The Amir was pleased that I had made friends with the Mustophi as he said it would help him, and said that the Mus- tophi‘s miisson was entirely dictated by the Russians. He laughingly added three of these emissaries came from Meshed; two have gone and the third will go too. He has lost much of his fear of the Russian Vice-Consul and openly derided him. Mustophi Khalik Khan on his return visit to me after clearing the room for private conversation again narrated to me his former connection with the Indian Government and led me to understand that he had had to be very wary in his report to Meshed about his having visited me and having become so intimate. He said he had explained to the Rukn-ud-Daulah that he had done no more than pay a return visit to me ! and that as I was a friend of Sardar Ayub Khan, he had been anxious to hear news of him, etc. He also said that his orders regarding the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk were very strong and were not for his good, but that now he hoped to arrange matters, add ing that he hoped I would see in this his desire to serve our interests. The Mus tophi is an Afghan and an adventurer, neither of which qualifications would make one trust him very far. I believe that he has acquired some influence over the Rukn-ud-Daulah and that he came down here knowing that by carrying out the Rukn-ud-Daulah’s wishes he was also acting not contrary to the interests of the Russians. Finding that the British influence in Seistan was so paramount, he allowed himself to be captured and is now anxious to ride in on the flowing tide. In any case untrustworthy though he may be it is possible he may serve our interests both here and at Meshed. I hear that the Amir has now received promises of support from Tehran and that he has adopted quite a dehant attitude towards the Rukn-ud-Daulah and his emissary, the Mustaphi, I am in hopes that the final result of the extra demand for revenue will be attended with no change of Government here, but will be settled quietly by the more usual plan of a little extra peshkash all round. Bazar rumours. Seth Sulaiman reports that Mr. Miller has acquired land on the Helmund to grow cotton. I can hardly believe that Seth Sularman rightly understood Mr. Miller and I have not received this news from any other source. It is an old rumour which I heard when I first came here. It is said that the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk has taken Rs. 6,000 from me for the site on which I have my camp. It is said a Russian merchant is coming here, but from what Mr. Miller tells me, it will be difficult to induce a Russian subject to come so far. Mr. Miller is said to have again reported the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk for showing him so little attention. There is no truth in the rumour that the Amir intends going to Tehran as reported in my Diary No. 5 for period 1st to 14th May 1900. 6or Mi ! 0 IT TnH r i e k CheS me ° f any s . us P icions being aroused regarding Sarhad with anyone. ^ 1 H neVef mentl0ned ‘he point or discussed that border mv nUrl'N^^f J, S n ° W 7 er l hotanda stron g hot wind blows every day.

The health of the camp is excellent and all are in good spirits. Dated Nusratbad; F/ie i$tk June I goo AD^ E. CHENEVIX-TRENCH, Major Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan. G. C. Bress, Simla.--No, 621 F. D.—27-7-X500—^1. 71 / / Diary No. 9 of Major G. Chenevix Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, for period from 24th June to 12th July 1900. June 24th, 1 goo. —Mr. Miller had breakfast. Mr. Miller is at heart an Anglophile and consequently though he did his best on arrival to establish some Russian influence, he is now a passive on-looker to English trade and interests in Seistan. June 25th .—Received a visit from some Katkhudas from Mian Kangi. It is now becoming the rule for Katkhudas who come from outlying parts of Seistan to make a call here when business brings them Nusratabad. June 26th .—Heard from the Hospital Assistant at Birjand that it was re ported that the Wali of Meshed w r ould send another emissary to bring about a revenue settlement between Mustophi Khalik Khan and the Amir. I have no confirmation of this rumour and do not believe it, as since the Mustophi has consulted me and has showm his intimation to take my advice, I believe the revenue question will be agreeably settled and the Amir’s position here will not be threatened, which event may be said will be entirely to our benefit. June 27th .—It was brought to my notice that Mr. Miller paid frequent visits to the Head Mujtahid here, and though he had had a difference with that Mulla’s son, Mulia Mehdi, had recently become reconciled to him. Mr. Miller has always aimed at cultivating the friendship of those who are at variance with the Amir. The Amir is quite independent of Mulla’s influence, and Mr Miller’s friends are incapable of altering the feelings of the Amir which are so pronouncedly in our favour. These very Mullaswhom Mr. Miller has handsomely rewarded have made and continue to make overtures to me, even plead to be favoured with more recognition and have stated that they made a mistake in throwing in their lot with the unpopular side. June 28th .—Mulla Muhammad Hosain visited Munshi Ahmad Din by night. His object was to state that Mulla Mehdi, the son of the Head Mujtahid, was in some trepidation because he saw that at the time I visited his father, I utterly ignored him, which, considering that he had met me previously, was unaccountable to him. He asked what he had done wrong that I should so slight him, and was profuse in his offers of service to ingratiate himself in my favour. As a matter of fact I was engrossed in conversation with the old Mulla and did not even recognise the son (Mulla Mehdi) who when 1 came had only condescended to meet me clandestinely five mvles out of Nusratabad. The Mulla has since been assiduous in trying to curry favour, but I have little to do with him in the first place because I do not trust him and, secondly, as I want for nothing I can ask him to do nothing. As the Mulla is considered the cleverest man in Seistan, his acts conspi cuously show the esteem in which we are held here and the importance attached to being in our good books. In the evening I had a small gymkhana. The sowars did some tent peg ging and there were tugs of war, etc. This small gathering was so friendly and so popular that I determined to repeat the trial at a later date. June 2gth .—From reports which came to me it appeared that Mr. Miller was making some spasmodic efforts to establish some friendliness with the peopK. Muhammad Rahim Khan is his go-between and was the former Russian news- writer here, and through him Mr. Miller endeavours to obtain interviews with the people. Muhammad Rahim Khan w f as reported to have taken a house in the town at some distance from the Vice-Consul’s house to catch unwilling visitors to the Russian side. The plan has proved futile, the attractions at my camp are to strong.2 Mr. Miller was said to ask any visitors that did come whether they were satisfied with the present Amir’s rule. The people are much too afraid of the Amir to answer in the negative, but the question combined with the character of Mr. Miller’s friends points to his desire to undermine rather than uphold the exist ing Government here That he should do so is perhaps natural, seeing how favourable the reigning party is to our side, but his role of an intriguer cannot at present be popular, or even profitable in Seistan. June 30th. —At the invitation of Mulla Mehdi, Munshi Ahmad Din went to see him. The Mulla expressed his desire to be of service to us in some form. Munshi Ahmad Din, while assuring him of our good will, answered that we were in no need of any particular service at present from him, that we had only come here to look after our traders, and were quite satisfied that those interests would be safeguarded, and that we were quite satisfied with our reception and position in Seistan. He expressed astonishment that we had been able to do so much and that we seemed to know everything. The Intizam-i-Diwan, a second emissary,from the Wali, came to call on me. He had formerly held aloof but apologized for his neglect. There is no importance to be attached to his visit to Seistan. His visit to me was natural as he saw that 1 was on friendly terms with every one. In the evening Munshi Ahmad Din visited the Mustophi Khalik Khan who expressed his pleasure at having made my acquaintance, and again said how grateful he had been for my advice regarding the revenue settlement of Seistan and how he had written to the VVali in my praise making use of my arguments to leave matters in Seistan as they were. July 1st. —Paid a private visit to the Amir. In conversation he said that the Mustophi and he had as yet come to no arrangement about the revenue. He made a joke of his usual answer to all demands for money, which was “ take grain, I have no money.” Now as it is quite impossible to realize on the enormous stocks of grain here and equally so to transport it with any profit, the answer finally closes any arguments for enhanced revenues and even for revenue in arrears. In my conversation with the Amir I pointed out that owing to the water channels of Seistan being unbridged, the caravans coming from Robat for Meshed avoided Nusratabad and passed eight miles off, a decided disadvantage for the trade of Nusratabad and a difficulty for the customs authorities, the traders and myself. I suggested that a road with bridges would be a benefit. The Amir at once said he would order bridges to be built to Nusratabad, which is tantamount to ordering a road. Since my interview I have had the satisfaction of hearing that instant orders were given and the road is in a fair way towards being accomplished. I had already aligned the road from the cultivated area of Seistan proper to Robat, and have built shelters, so now we have a completed road to Nusratabad from Quetta. What the Russian Consul thinks of this I do not know, but any how he is powerless to even obstruct as no one objects to canals being bridged in this country. This action of the Amir is, I think, a sure sign of his marked friendliness which I have often brought to notice. In the evening I saw Mr. Miller. He was friendly as usual but despondent and full of the want of support he received from his Government. He said “ they want me to encourage Russian trade and how can I ? wffiat Russian merchant would come to Seistan, a place worse than Siberia.” He said that since he had been here he had heard nothing from his Foreign Office or even from his Minister at Tehran. How, he said, would a Russian merchant compete against caravan loads of goods from India? He said he had asked two Arme nian merchants to come but had been met by a blank refusal. He only hoped, he said, it would not be his lot to stay here very long.' ' He had also, he said, been asked to obtain statistic of trade here, which wa s quite impossible in a country like Persia. He often comes over to me and enjoys our sports and likes having a meal and a talk. July Some Seistani traders came to get a letter to help them on the Nushki road. They said they were collecting 400 camels of Seistan produce to take to India. Seth Suleiman came to ask my advice as he said the Russian Vice-Consul had asked him to sell some Russian goods on commission which Mr. Miller would get from Moscow. When next I saw Mr. Miller I laughed at his proposal and said that it would not be trade unless the goods were able to hold their own, in which case Seth Suleiman would himself get Russian goods just as he does German or French. I pointed out that there was already one man who sold Russian cotton cloth. Mr. Miller was not aware of this man, who in fact does but little trade in that line here. Ihe question of making Seth Suleiman a Russian Agent dropped after that. I thought the method of getting a footing for Russian goods a clumsy one and a sure sign of the hopeless view Mr. Miller took of ever seeing any Russian trade here. July 3rd. —Mr. Miller came over in the evening and after speaking about Seth Suleiman and his Russian goods told me that a Russian Doctor would come here in the double capacity of doctor and chancellor; but that as there were arguments going on about his pay, it was not likely he would be here until next April! I repeated in the evening the gymkhana experiment. I had one tent pitched, in which Mr. Miller and I sat and witnessed donkey races for the Seistani boys, tent pegging, wrestling on horse back and tugs of war. There were several hundred Seistanis and most of the local minor officials who sat on carpets and were entertained by Munshi Ahmad Din. The Seistanis entered with great spirit into the fun. They learned to clap for applause and enjoyed the tent pegging very much. A team then pulled the sowars at a tug of war, and though they did not win, showed great pluck. There was immense excitement and every one was very pleased. Mr. Miller was forcibly struck, I think, at the crowd. I heard that Mr. Miller intended sending some Seistanis to buy goods in Askabad for sale here. The Seistanis are very much against the Russian form of encouraging trade by giving bounty or indulgences. They say it spoils the trade tor the majority. My informants said they knew sugar to sell in Askabad at 7 karans and in Meshed at 3, so that people bought up the sugar in Meshed for 3 karans and smuggled it back to Askabad to sell it at 7. I do not think that Mr. Miller will seriously think of taking this course. Mr. Miller has besides often told me that the Russian Government has given up pampering their traders by bounties and rewards, finding it demoralized the trader and resulted in no good. July 5M.—Mr. Miller dined and told me that the pay of the newly appoint ed Russian Consul-General in Bombay was ^ 1,500 a year, which he said was too small. He further said that all ranks in the Consulate service were paid according to their Consular grade and regardless of where they were serving. He said he drew the same pay here as if he was Vice-Consul at Barcelona, and that his Government had no idea of the expense of living in an out-of-the-way place like Seistan, where everything of civilisation had to be imported. July 6th .— Returned the visit of the Intizam-i-Diwan and paid a visit to the Sarbang Muhammad Raza Khan. July yth. —A caravan from Quetta arrived bringing indigo for Meshed. There was some difficuliy about the customs, but it was amicably arranged as the customs concession in Persia is now being newly brought into force in Seistan. I have added some remarks under head of general remarks on the subject.4 Seth Sulaiman presented a petition for an advance of Rs. 20,000 to start an extension of his business in Meshed. I hope his request will be agreed to. He has done good work here, and an experiment of carrying trade in the form of retail trade at Meshed would be very interesting, I believe also profitable. I have written a separate letter forwarding his petition. Munshi Ahmad Din with the Native officer rode to Eskel to pay a visit to Mir Abbas as we heard he had fallen from his horse, and also because I have been told he had been giving the Russian Vice-Consul some information. Munshi Ahmad Din found that there was no truth in his having fallen from his horse and heard from him that he had]refesed to have any dealings with the Russians, though he had been frequently asked to go and see Mr. Miller and had had a present given him. July 8th. —Sunday. In my last Diary I reported that Abbas Ali, Hospital Assistant, had left for a tour in the Mian Kangi District. He returned on the 8th July after having attended to large numbers of patients and having travelled along the Afghan frontier, reported on with map by me in my Diary No. 6 for period 15th May to 25th May 1900. In the evening I received a visit from Akram Khan trader and Warka, the two traders in Seistan who have always been supporters of the Russians and their news-writers. 1 cannot quite account for their visit except that they see there is now nothing to be gained from the Russians. They both offered me their services, while Akram Khan said he always had camels at my disposal. I said I had no service to ask of them, that every one was very friendly, and that we wanted for nothing. I hoped that if they traded to India they would be successful. Later the newly-appointed Customs Collector called on me. He said that the new Customs regulations under the Belgian concession had not yet been pro mulgated, and that he was awaiting the arrival of Mirza Hosain from Meshed, who was to regulate the levying of the dues. He said in the meanwhile he collected 5 per cent ad valorem from Indian traders, wdiich they paid here or else at Meshed, provided they gave security here. I asked him how he proposed valu ing the various articles which would come from India I showed him that to take the articles at any other value than that given in the invoice would be im possible, for he could not open every box, nor could he value each article at a local price if he did. He quite agreed and said he would do anything I suggest ed. So we agreed to refer the matter to his chief, and in the meanwhile he said he would arrange matters smoothly. When his chief comes I shall be able to come to some terms with him, and I hope the Customs duties will in no way obstruct trade. July gth. —In the evening the Sarhang with Sardar Purdil Khan paid me a visit. July' /oM.—Received a visit from Mustophi Khalik Khan, who was very open in his assurances of friendship. He afterwards had breakfast with Munshi Ahmad Din. General Remarks. Spread of British influence in Seistan. I think that from a persual of this diary there will be no doubt as to the genuine friendliness of every one towards the British representative in Seistan. The people, like the ruler of Seistan, see how closely their interests lie with those of India, and by scrupulous care in the conduct of every one in the camp, it has been quite impossible for any party to bring up anything against us. All supplies have been paid for at once by every one. Every one who comes to the camp has been treated with respect. Coolies working have been paid daily and aften be fore me. As the site of my camp or rather my buildings is the high road to everywhere, many people ride across our maidan and I have opportunities of talk ing to them, or of inviting them into my house. We have avoided ever paying more than what is fair and customary here, and our presents have been few. I have5 ■■ relied almost entirely on personal influence and my knowledge of Persian to make fiends with these people, nor have they been spoilt. Katkhudas and others of that rank who come to see me come with their offerings and sit on the ground. The camp has become a sort of rendezvous in the evenings, and it is quite a common sight to see 10 or :o horsemen riding into the camp or galloping their horses on the maidan, or having tea or kalian with the native officer or Munshi Ahmad Din. I am greatly indebted to both these men for the interest they have taken in securing the friendship of every one, and in their tact and good humour in enter taining them. As the native officer is a Sadozai Shahzada, those with Afghan proclivities are attracted to his entertainments. This intercourse with the people and officials keeps the camp alive and ac customs the Persian of Seistan to the English Sahib and his “ entourage.” T U j n ?. iary T men tioned that nearly all the party were now housed. The domed building! have erected without one piece of wood in them now form a collection of small houses, and the camp looks like a village. The cost of all the buddings has been a little over Rs. i,coo. The buildings, besides making hfe bearable to every one have had a great political value. Their erection hal tested the feelings of thejpeople. They have shown our strength to the Seistanis and are a sure sign that we mean to stay here. ’ For myself I have three rooms with a serving room. As they are well car- petted they give a good impression to visitors of the English mode of life and have added to my influence. All the buildings have been built so as to form use ful annexes to any good house which may be built afterwards. The site is capital, capable of any extension, in a good position, and on the best land. The cost of my small house has been less than a Swiss collage tent which would have been very hot to have lived and worked in. The boisterous wind of this place, too, would have torn it to pieces. The daily payment of the coolies for the buildings has been of great political value, while the local Persian official has always been attached by the work, and so through these means I have been able to make many acquaintances. The building of a mosque has been a great political move. All the local mullas are loud in its praises, and very few of them have not been 10 see it and have not praised me for the act of toleration as they call it. Munshi Ahmad Din and the native officers have taken charge of the mosque, and it has already received offers for embellishment from various sources. I find that every evening many people come from outside to say their prayers there, and to sit in the shade of it. In fact, it has become a sort of political meeting place for all sorts and kinds of people. The Musjid has brought many people to see me. I hope that though no sanction was given for buildings, my action will be approved of, not only because we have secured through this means a good site, but because we have increased by this small expenditure our prestige and our influence in Seistan, until I think we may safely say that its paramountcy, as far as the province of Seistan is concerned, is an accomplished fact. This is not in my opinion an optimistic view, nor do I attribute it to any particular good management on my part. It is the natural result of the opening of the mad and of the various visits of my predecessors here. The Eastern Persian-Afghan border .—For the present there is no sign of any quarrels along the border either from opposition boundary claims 'or over water rights which could assume any importance. Abbas Ali reports that a few grain stacks have been burnt, and that there have been some quarrels, but these have been among the Seistanis themselves. In one instance some Afghans have cultivated land which is considered Persian, but with the free intercourse that naturally exists on such a border, this encroachment is not taken seriously by the Persians. $Increased demand by the Persian Government on Setstan revenues. —As already stated, nothing definite has been settled. The emissaries from the Wall are still awaiting replies from Meshed, and owing to the influence I have acquired over Mustophi 'Khalik Khan, the affair will settle itself amicably in the end. During conversation with the Mustophi I have suggested to him that a caravan serai for the use of traders is a necessity here. I pointed out to him that to allow the Indian traders and perhaps Hindus to find quarters any where in the town might lead to trouble besides being inconvenient to the customs authorities. The arguments appeared to him to be reasonable, and he was in favour of the suggestion. He said he would mention it to the Wall and get permission for us to build anything we liked in that way, and would recommend that the Persian Government should build a caravan-sarai here. I do not put much faith in his promise to write for this sanction, but it is as well that the suggestion should be in the air so as not to come as a surprise when we do ask for a caravan-serai. Customs dues hi Sieslan .—The Customs duties may call for some remarks later on. As the concession for Persian customs has been given to the Belgians, arrangements have already been begun here to carry out the levying of them under their direction. As reported in my Diary No. 7 for 30th May, Colonel Temple sent me a letter of introduction from Mr. Castaique for one Sayad Hosain who would come to arrange matters. This official has not yet put in an appearance. He seems to have had trouble with the Birjand merchants which has delayed him. His servant is here and came to see me as stated in my diary. As far as l can understand, the concession allows the agreed 5 per cent, ad valorem duty on Russian and English goods from across the border, and also 1 in 27 on all internal traffic, exempting of course goods which have paid the 5 per cent, ad valorem. The next point was that goods coming from India would pay their duty at Seistan or provide local security. Local security is not easy to obtain for Indian merchants coming from India, and it will facilitate matters if they pay their 5 per cent duty in Seistan and so save themselves further annoyance. They can always bring a “ barat ” on Seth Suleiman for any money necessary. In Seistan the British Consul can, too, protect their interests. This latter course pleases the Persians better than giving security, as the Customs people always distrust any one who does not pay duty fearing he will smuggle his goods into Afghanistan. There remains the question of value. The Customs official here before mentioned argued that he had a right to 5 per cent, on the price realized by the mer chandize in Seistan not on its marked value in India or wherever it was bought. 1 pointed out to him the impossibilities first of inspecting every article that came and next of valuing it independent of its value entered in the invoice of the trader. I also said that if a trader brought a caravan of miscellaneous goods for Meshed and insisted on paying the dues here, it would be quite out of the question for him to levy customs according to the selling rates in Meshed. The local Customs official agreed to my reasoning and said he would obtain fresh orders on this point. In the meanwhile I apprehend no difficulty in arrang ing an agreement with him for duty on caravans coming before Sayad Hosain arrives. It is said that a Customs house will be built here and the Customs flag will fly over it and all merchandize will be bound to pass through the serai. It is not yet determined where this serai will be built. The matter presents some difficulty. If it is built between this and Rabat, it will of course catch the Indian trade easiest, but to put it some 30 or 40 miles away from the capital would be very convenient for traders wishing to refer to the Consul who must be at Nusra- tabad. If the Custom House is at Nusratabad, it is off the direct road between 6% | Rabat and Meshed, and the caravans will naturally try to evade it. As before stated, the Amir has agreed to bridge the channels on the road to Nusratabad, and at present I favour the Customs House being in Nusratabad where the Amir and the British Consul are. Later on I shall be in a better position to advise the Customs authorities and to report developments. Bazaar Rumours. 1 hear that the Shah intends visiting Meshed after his return from Europe. E. CHENEVIX TRENCH, Major, Nusratabad; Her Britannic Majesty's Consul The 12 th July igoo.J fQ* Seistan, ■■■■■ ^ 7 ) G. C. Press, SimIa.***No. 714 F. D.-s-iS-S'Iqoo,— 7/jM July .—I heard from Ghulam Jilani, the Hospital Assistant at Birjand, that Sartip Mir Maasum Khan had particularly requested that he Ghulam Jilan 1 should be allowed to come to Seistan with him in the event of the Sartip coming, as Ghulam Jilani was attending to his eyes and a continuation of the attendance was desirable. I also received a letter from the Sartip hoping I would allow Ghulam Jilani to accompany him. It could very easily be arranged to exchange the Hospital Assistants at Birjand and Seistan for a month or so and I would be glad to do so, first to please the Sartip and to bring him thus under my influence on his arrival here, second to make the personal acquaintance of Ghulam Jilani, third to have reports from Abbas Ali, Hospital Assistant here, from Birjand written from our standard here, fourth as in the event of the Sartip coming here the Amir Hashmatul Mulk, his father, will pay a visit to the Shaukatul Mulk. I would be glad to have Abbas Ali at Birjand to keep the Amir up to his pledges of friendship. I wrote to Ghulam Jilani saying that if the Sartip did come to Seistan, which I very much doubted his doing, I sanctioned his accompanying him, and said Abbas Ali should take his place at Birjand for a time. I wrote to Colonel Temple on the subject asking that my orders might be confirmed. 14th July. —Mqnshi Ahmad Din visited the Mustophi Abdul Khalik, who again repeated the usual opinions expressed here, which were that the English were near neighbours and had interests here while the Russians had none. Mus- tophi Khalik Khan is spoken of by Colonel Temple as a man with wide powers. It is therefore well that he understands the situation and is confirmed in his opinion that our interests here are paramount. 17th July .—Seth Suleiman who had been given sanction to build a shop asked whether he might build within the fort. The Amir said this was different to building outside but that he would consider the request and that probably there would be no objection. t8th July .—Seth Suleiman said he had come to an agreement with the Amir to build a shop in the fort, on the condition that he should not lay any claim to the land on which it was built. I concurred in this agreement. In the evening I received a visit from the Amir. I had intended visiting him myself and had sent to inform him of my intention. The message, however, was wrongly conveyed to him and he understood I wished to see him. The Amir therefore came at once. I apologized for the mistake which did not seem in any way to have put him out. igth July .—In the afternoon we had our weekly Gymkhana which has now become a weekly institution. I find that it is a very popular move having these weekly gatherings. They are, too, very good for the camp, as they create a weekly event. The sowars turn out in their best and are very keen in showing off their tent pegging and other accomplishments to the benefit of their horse manship and their horses. I have several tents pitched and flags flown and the small race course has quite an attractive and even gay appearance. The Russian Consul always attends with his party. The Seistanis come in numbers and have now learnt orderly behaviour and even discrimination in applause. Many Kat- khudas and officials attend and are provided with carpets, etc. Tea and Kalian are of course handed round. The Amir himself has not yet come to the gather ing nor do I quite expect him to at once. The gathering I give out is entirely one for our own amusement, no invitations are issued, though anyone is welcome. To invite the Amir and other big Sardars would make difficulties besides greatly adding to the at present modest expense of the entertainment as their army of retainers would all require to be entertained. 1The entertainment has the great merit of giving great amusement and interest to the entire camp for one day in the week and is of special value during the very hot and dull months. 22nd July. —Mr. Miller had breakfast. 26th July .—The usual Gymkhana, which was well attended. Khan Bahadur Mehdi Ali Khan, grandson of the late Nawab W alajah of Carnatic, visited me. He was a pilgrim travelling to Meshed and had come from Hyderabad, Deccan. He said he had no trouble on the journey, but both from his narrative and that of previous travellers I gather they expect far greater facilities for travelling along the Nushki road than they get. A pilgrimage in their eyes appears to be not an arduous journey, but a journey with the greatest amount of comfort possible and with the least trouble. I notice that a camel kajawa appears to be the most popular method adopted for the journey. The travellers I have seen here expect that at least a caravanserai shall be found at each place, with a bunia from whom they can buy all they want. Any thing short of that they consider a great hardship. 27lh Julv. —We played our first game of foot-ball much to the interest of the locals. I always try to keep the camp amused and interested and find games and sports have the best results. I am also desirous of making my camp a constant source of interest to the Seistanis. I arouse their curiosity by games and sports previously unknown to them and so attract them where they are well treated. These attractions act as advertisement to our name in this country. While riding several miles out of Nasratabad I was astonished to find a party of small boys having a private game of foot-ball with their hat. The round Persian cap was being balanced on a stone for the kickoff. Some cricket things, a lawn tennis net and some spears are on their way here. At present the Sowars tent peg with their sabres. 2gth July. —Mr. Miller had breakfast. General Remarks. Progress of British influence. I have nothing further to add to what I wrote in my last diary as far as local conditions allow. British influence is for all purposes the only influence here. he Russian Vice-Consul in no way obstructs or interferes, he adopts the role o being a mere onlooker and openly says he is too cut off here, with no possibility of any Russian trade or of any Russian influence. The conditions therefore are entmely in our favour and 1 only look and hope for a very rapid development of the trade by the INushki route. r There appears to me to be a demand in Persia for articles of Indiar manufacture, such as saddles, boots, stuffs, etc. Indian articles are better adapter to the eastern life of the Persian than the European articles. English saddle* are too expensive for them, but a Cawnpore saddle would, I think, be hailed with deught. French shoes and English boots have been sold here, but they arc uxuiy for the rich only. Cawnpore boots would, I think, meet with a Ireat demand. I have, therefore, addressed a letter to the Chamber of Commerce at Cawnpore, suggestmg that they should, on the part of Cawnpore firms, send a and S 1 e ;. st , an wuh b °ots, saddles and samples of other wares He should be able to establish agencies here at Birjand and elsewhere. •bp !

My mu,, houses have been the greatest relief and comfort to all.The entire camp is well. I have not had a case of fevw sinos I came. At present, with the exception of three cases of venereal, no sickness exists. 1 he horses too are all in excellent condition and all effective. There are in camp 32 . horses all standing out. With care and attention and by adopting some Persian methods for taking care of horses, the results of mosquitoes and the famous fly of Seistan are modified to the extent of nullifying their danger to the life of a horse or of even causing him to lose condition. Increased demand by the Persian Government on Seistan revenues. The matter still remains unsettled and is being arranged in the usual Persian way. I do not anticipate any vigorous action on the part of the higher authori ties, even if the total amount asked for is not forthcoming. Customs dues in Seistan. Nothing has as yet taken place towards establishing the new customs regu lations and no question has arisen during the interval since I last reported on the matter. Bazaar rumours. The report that the Shah intends visiting Meshed grows in strength. It was reported to me that the Russian Vice-Consul had written to say that English influence was greater here than anywhere else he had seen in Persia. As the Consul writes in Russian and has no clerk who can read that language the report is probably invented. It was reported that the Russians had acquired a right of way along the Perso-Afghan border for a railway, and that they would obtain a concession to take over the revenues of Seistan. These reports, though common property, are not believed. Mr. Miller has several times asked me whether I have received reports of plague at Kabul, which report was causing him some uneasiness. The report was evidently founded on the appearance of cholera at Kabul. Transport of corpses by the Seistan Mushki route for Meshed. I*have received a letter from Captain Webb Ware asking me what the local Government would say to corpses being brought to Meshed through Seistan from India. I have replied that I think the question had best not be put to the local Government just now and that if possible the Shias of India should be dissuaded from such action, at any rate until plague is over in India. My reasons being, that it would be a pity to launch such a topic during the dead season we are now having here. The local Government would probably raise no objection at all, but they would discuss the question and the Russian Consul would then be able to arouse violent opposition to the proceeding before the corpses arrived. As we have lulled him into inaction, I would deprecate his being given such an opening. If the corpses must come, let them come, and it will be time enough to mention the subject if questions are raised. The local Government is not a Government to seriously consult. In addition, I do not think that the transport of corpses along so undevelop ed a road w'ould be a good advertisement and for the present all ventures along this road should be regarded as advertising mediums. Dated Nusratabad ; ^ G. C. TRENCH, Major, The 31 st July igoo. ) Her Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seista'\ % G, C. Ptess, Simla.—No, 813 F. D.-vp-ipoo,—31. 31 t Diaries. D. No. 516 ’F. Diary No. 11 of Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, from 1st to 15th August 1900. 1st August —I had a conversation with Seth Suleiman upon the pos sibility of introducing Indian sugar to compete with the French loaf sugar now universally used in Seistan, and, I believe, generally in the Southern portions of Persia. 1 had great hopes that Indian sugar could compete in price, at least in Seistan. From figures given me by Seth S aeiman I find that Indian sugar can be landed in Seistan from the Rosa Sugarworks at Rs. 22-8 per Indian maund while the retail price of French sugar in Seistan is the same. In other words the Indian sugar^ could not be sold at a remunerative price in competition with French sugar. 1 he Indian sugar bears a much higher reputation for sweetness than any other sugar. Seth Suleiman is not prepared to venture in this line, though the Rosa Sugar- works are prepared to offer him a 10 per cent, commission, by no means a small profit in itself. He has written to the Rosa Sugarworks asking whether they wmuld be pre pared to allow a 15 per cent, commission on sales, in which case he w’ould order from them. I should like to see Indian sugar compete with French sugar, and if a railway in the future lands it at the Indian border at Robat, it will command the market in Seistan and Birjand. Beyond that it will probably not compete with Russian sugar which is sold at a very low rate in the Northern provinces of Persia. A criminal accused of robbery and murder was by the order of the Hash- mut-ul-Mulk blown from a gun in the presence of the people. The Russian Consulate subordinates remarked that the Amir showed very marked independence in carrying out this capital punishment without the sanction of his Government. Any signs of independence on the part of the Hashmut-ul-Mulk are not looked on with favour by them, who attribute his conduct to moral support from the English. Mr. Miller remarked to me in conversation that the Novoe Vryma news paper was always addressed to him from Petersburgh in English. They evident ly he said consider Seistan a British province ! 5th August. —Mr. Miller who always complains of the apathy and short comings of the Russian trader remarked that trade reports such as Captain White had written from Meshed, to the effect that Russian traders adapted their supply to demand did a great deal of harm to Russian trade. He said all such reports were eagerly read in Russia and the Russian merchant prone already to consider that his enterprize needed no development plumes himself on such remarks and is more apathetic than ever. As an ex ample of Russian apathy, he said he had ordered 200 bottles of sodawater and lemonade, at his own expense and for private consumption. The Russian trader in Ashkabad refused to comply with the order on the plea that the distance to Seistan was too great, and the trouble of packing and despatchino- was not worth taking for so small an order. 6th August .—I heard from Colonel Temple that he agreed to the temporary exchange of places between Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali, from Seistan to Birjand, and of Ghulam Jelani from Birjand to Seistan. Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali receives very much higher pay than Hospital Assistant Ghulam Jelani, besides an entertainment allowance of Rs. 50 a month. With these emoluments, he is more in a position to take his place as a sole representative than Hospital Assistant Ghulam Jelani is, who receives no entertainment allowance. Abbas Ali has great power in exercising his influence over the Persians, and with the fairfield he will have at Birjand he should be able to prepare the way there for the Consulate as he did here. Jth August .—Sher Syad, a Pishln horse dealer, arrived from Meshed on his way to Quetta. He had bought 7! horses. He makes a halt here of some days before proceeding. He informed me that he had paid an export duty on the horses of 13 krans a head, or about Rs. 4. As 1 believe that, under a very old agreement dating as far back as 1823, the Shah of Persia allowed all horses to be exported through the province of Pars, i.e., by the Persian Gulf ports, free of duty, it seems open to some question whether the Persian Government can charge export duty on horses leaving Persia by Seistan. I have addressed a letter to Colonel Temple on the subject, suggesting that if possible steps might be taken to remove this export tax on horses. 8th August .—Received a sudden visit from Sardar Purdil Khan, and the Mustophi to the Hashmut-ul*Mulk. They requested me to cancel the order sending Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali to Birjand, on the giounds that he was very popular here. I said I was sorry I could not alter arrangements already made, and promised that Abbas Ali should return to Seistan after a short time. Abbas Ali has recently married the daughter of Syad Abdul Kadir, a refugee from Herat referred to in my diary No. 4. The Syad was doing all he could to prevent the transfer of Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali, and I have no doubt pre vailed on Sardar Purdil Khan to make this request to me. He naturally, being a refugee, is glad to have his daughter married to a well-paid Government official with whom he can live. I am not altogether pleased with the marriage. I think that, at present, it is best that Government officials in Seistan and Birjand should have no local ties. 8th August .—Seth Suleiman signed a bond empowering him to build a shop within the post of Nasrahabad on condition that he should turn out if the ground was ever wanted by the Persian Government. I have no fears that such a step will be likely or even possible. Seth Suleiman has begun to build his shop immediately opposite the “ Ark ” or the part of the post occupied by the Amir. The establishment of a shop within the post is a great concession, and Seth Suleiman deserves credit for the way he has arranged matters. gth August.—7 \\q Customs official here visited me regarding the payment of customs dues on some medicines which had arrived from India for Abbas Ali, Hospital Assistant. 1 explained that the medicines were Consulate stores and there fore free. The Customs official who has not yet received any orders from the Belgian Syndicate for Persian customs, and who works according to his own rights agreed as he always does to my settlement of the affair. There is no trouble here with the Customs. In the evening was the usual Gymkhana which was largely attended. 10th August.— Khan, the Baluch Sardar, who has helped us so much since our arrived here, and whom Captain Webb Ware has specially recommended for an allowance, arranged with the Pishin horse dealers to supply camels erain and bhusa to accompany them to Dawandin. The arrangement of carrying grain and bhusa from here or the road, is found to be the cheapest and most f ° r . S'W'y.'ng forage to a large number of horses travelling by the Nushki road. The supplies along the road are limited. y I have established at Girdi Thana a bania from among the Baluchis who will supply gram and fodder for the new posts between this and Robat. ’ Girdi Thana is the largest post house on this new line which I have built There has been no oppos.t.on to the building of these domed rest houses. The Seistani official never ventures into those regions, known as the Seistan desert and doe, not care much what goes on there. The chain of rest houses and wells is not complete between Quetta and Nasrahabad. 3 0t Some of the sowars of my escort have been living in their tents since thev came though I have been able to build them one room as a shelter from the 2tents have now been blown to shreds though they were i s aped. I his will show the force of the incessant wind which blows here. • , . /2 ^ August. It was reported to me that a man was found murdered tv it in a tew miles at Nasrahabad. The man was unknown in the country, and the mur erers were of course not traced. Such an event in Seistan does not attract much attention. m ^! l 0 uS ^ ^ e ceived a letter from the Manager of the Imperial Bank at es ed, asking many ques'ions, on exchange, trade, and products of tseistan. this letter was a reply to a letter I sent to the Bank through Colonel Temple, -S-g ° n them to open a branch of their Bank here. From the reply I received t e Bank Manager did not appear enthusiastic on the prospects of Banking in beistan, though he admitted he knew nothing about the country. I have an swered his letters and combated many of his views, and he promised that all I had to say on the subject should be sent to Tehran for the consideration of the head of the Bank, Mr. Rubino. He appeared to think that 1 should be able to report a ready made banking business for the bank to step into, while prospective advan tages carried no weight. I have now urged the certainty of traffic on this road, and 1 shall continue to press the matter before the bank. Sooner or later they will have to establish a branch here, and it will be a great convenience to the traders, as Seistan must always be a place to exchange monies. I have suggested that the Bank should at least send some one to report on the banking possiblities of the country. I can do no more than point out the opportunity. Received a letter about cholera at Kabul from Colonel Temple. He said that that Persians meditated sending two doctors to Seistan to enforce quarantine regulations, and that the Russians intended having all goods disinfected at Tur- bat and Karez.. The advent of the Persian doctors can be awaited with com placency, and since Cholera is now decreasing in Kabul and there is no traffic between that place and this, it should not be hard to see that quarantine is not made an excuse for restricting trade between this and Meshed. Mr. Miller here, with whom I consulted on the cholera regulations, takes a sensible view of the whole thing. He says his Consul General is scared, and had written him alar mist reports, etc. Mr. Miller’s reply he said was, we were in no way affected here by the cholera at Kabul and were not as alarmed as they seemed to be in Meshed. He has shown no desire to suggest any measures here. At present therefore quarantine restriction may be disregarded. 14 th August .—A special deputation from Afghanistan by order of the Amir of Kabul arrived from Chawkansur ( a few miles over the Afghan border) consisting of a “ Sadbashi ” and eight regulars. Their mission was to ask for an explanation from the Hashmut-ul-Mulk, why several of his men, under one Dost Muhammad Khatkhuda, had crossed the Afghan frontier and had mur dered several Afghans. The Hashmut-ul-Mulk replied that the action was taken with his consent to avenge the murder of one of his subjects by Afghans and that he had ordered his men to move everything and kill everyone ^they could lay hands on. The “ Sadbashi ” with his men called on me and expressed as tonishment at the audacity of the Hashmut-ul-Mulk’s answer to the Amir Abdul Rahman. He also referred to the border dispute [vide my diary No. 6 ) and said the Afghans only claimed the Golashmid’s border. If the Sadbashi was correct in his statement there should not be much difficulty in settling the border claims. Were they to claim that their border shifted with the change in the course of the river, their dispute would involve larger interests, and might carry with it claims which Persia would feel it impossible to agree to. / 5 M Three cases of glanders appeared among the horses of my cavalry escort. One horse died and two I had shot. The lines have now been evacuated and all precautions taken. The disease is common in Persia but I hope the remaining horses may escape. It was unfortunate that at the time of the outbreak, nearly one-hundred horses on their way to Quetta were in my camp. They were of course at once turned out, and though none were infected, it would 3\ be well to Inspect them before they entered Quetta. I have reported the occur ence to the Agent to the Governor-General in Quetta. Progress of British influence m Seistan. Our position remains the same as reported in previous diaries, and is satis factory. Arnon^ minor methods of establishing British influence in Seistan, I would suggest that the new Vice-Consul be supplied with substantial scales and v eights, etc. At present I use a Salter’s scale to buy all the forage, etc., required, and although the Seistani is quite agreeable to this scale, and prefers our weights to his own, no Salter’s scale is as satisfactory to the uneducated mind as a balance scale. Besides a large scale I would suggest several small scales for household purchases. Seth Suleiman tells me that he uses Indian weights, and that they are preferred to the Persian weights, which are invariably stones. A few sets of small weights to give as presents, would be acceptable, and political. Increased demand by the Persian Government on Seistan revenues. This matter still remains unsettled. The Amir refuses to agree to the minimum sum demanded by the Persian Government as an equivalent to the grain portion of his annual payment. The Amir seems to be confident of his strength and refuses to alter his offer. Negotiations are therefore at a standstill. Customs dues in Seistan. There is nothing to complain of against the Customs authorities here, who are still without orders, under the new customs concession. Miscellaneous. The weather here is much cooler now, the thermometer going down rapidly, to. With the exception of the outbreak of glanders the health of the camp is satisfactory. Nasrahabad; The 20 th August igoo. G. CHENEVIX-TRENCH, Major, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan. . G, C. Press, Simla,- No. 906 F. D.— 85 - 9 . 1900 ,— 31.Diary No. 12 of Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty s Consul for Seistan, from 16th August to 31st August 1900. The precautions taken against the spread of glanders among the cavalry horses mentioned in my last diary proved sufficient to check the disease. No further cases have occurred and the horses have returned to their lines. i6th August .—The usual gymkhana took place. For the first t' me Surhang attended. He has always been anxious to do this, but has retrained as his father is said to have considered it would show too much attachment to the British cause. He used in this instance the occasion of making a return call as an opportunity to see the sports. ijth August.— Sartip Mir Mausum Khan arrived from Birjand. The people of the country are all pleased at his appearance on the scene. . He com mands universal loyalty except from Sardar Pardil Khan, and h.s immediate following, who hears the eventual return to power in Seistan of Sardar Syad Khan Naroi-Baluch, through the attachment to the latter s cause of the Saitip. The past history of Sardar Svad Khan has been fully narrated by me in a note forwarded with my No. 108 of 201'h August. Ihe Amir Ka hmut-ul-Mulk is said to be glad to have the Sartip back in Seistan, for he did not influenced bv the Shawkat-ul-Mulk, whom he consideis to be not too tnend'y to wards himself. The Amir hopes to arrange amicably the differences between Sardar Syad Khan and Sardar Purdil Khan, and then desires to have Seistan to be ruled by the Sartip, while he and the Surhang visit Birjand and possibly ien- ran, with a view to again being reinstated in 1 abas. 20th August .—Received a visit from Mustophi Khalik Khan, who talked about the revenue demand, and said he hoped the Amir would agree to the terms ordered from Tehran. 21st August .—The Rusian Vice-Consul has a Mirza from Meshed as an. attache. This man is most unpopalar here, and does a great deal of harm to the Russian cause. He affects an overbearing manner and demands obser\ances of etiquette, he is in no way entitled to. He paid a visit to the Amir and com plained openly that while the Russian Vice-Consul was treated with scant courtesy, messengers were sent far and wide for the Fnglish Consul when he represented that the water channels supplying his camp were running low. Mr. Miller a few days previously remarked to me that it was the duty of the Sartip to call on the Consuls first, and asked me what I thought. At the time I had not given the matter any consideration, and said so. I found out later that the orders of the Russian Government to their Consuls in Persia were that the Persian Sardars, not being ruling chiefs, should invariably call first on the Rus sian representative, an order no doubt easily enforced in Northern Persia. On enquiring into the etiquette of calling, I found that among equals it was custom ary for the first arrived to call on the later arrivals. And as I had when l came called on the Amir first and his son the Surhang, I called in the same manner on tne Sartip Mir Mausum Khan. My visit was a terrible blow to Mr. Miller for seeing that I am his senior, it quite stopped all chance of the Sartip making the first call on him, and as the Russian Consul could not go against the orders of his Government the matter had to be referred to Tehran. In the meanwhile no communication between Mr. Miller and the Sartip can exist. Mr. Miller in conversation with me later said that having to go by the orders of his Government had been a serious blow to his position here, for he could not expect any answer from his Government before two months and when he did receive orders, he was afraid his action would not be supported, and that he would be ordered to call, which would in the circumstances be a great loss of dignity.2 Mr Miller I believe hoped for great things on the arrival of the Sartip here. He had used all the Russian influence at Birjandto predispose the bartip towards the Russian cause. He counted too on the existing friction between the bartip and Sardar Purdil Khan, an avowed friend of the British, while he knew that sooner or later the Sartip would rule here, and on account of his Baluch blood exercise great control over all the Baluchis through Sardar Syad Khan, his uncle. The calling episode has, I hope, effectually knocked on the head all chances of biasing the Sartip in favour of the Russians and makes Mr. Millers position here more impossible than ever. There is not the least chance of the Amir inducing the Sartip to make the first call for independently of other reasons the Amir is said to have remarked that see ing that Mr. Miller made first calls on every Mustophi in Birjand and Seistan, he couldn’t understand there being any objection to his making the first call on the Sartip who was his son and heir. From my visit I was favourably impressed with the Sartip Mir Mausum Khan. He is a good looking young man of about 22 years of age, a slim figure, and with a quiet manner. He showed us nervousness at the official visit. His con versation was more direct than that of the ordinary Persian, and the Baluch inde pendence of character and dignity of manhood were clearly observable. I was sorry to see that he suffered much on account of his eyes. 2:»nd August. —Mr. Miller paid a visit of condolence on account of the death of the Duke of Coburg. 23rd August .—I received a return visit from the Sartip, he thanked me for having ordered Hospital Assistant Ghulam Jelani here from Birjand {vide D‘. T/ No. 11, August 6th), and counted the days which must elapse before his arrival. He said he had been almost blind before Ghulam Jelani attended him. and he had been very anxious to continue the cure. He attributes the weakness of his eye sight to the dust and perpetual wind of Seistan. 24th August .—Munshi Ahmed Din visited Mustophi Khalik Khan. The latter expressed hG willingness to be of any service tome in Meshed or elsewhere, he a so said that the Russian Vice-Consul had tried to induce him to arrange for the purchase of some land as an extension to the Russian Consulate here. 'I he Mustophi declined to help, as he said the Vice-Consul’s proposals were on such a large scale that it would be impossible to carry them out. 23th August .—I heard as a fact that the Amir .Hashmut-ul-Mufk holds a letter from Tehran stating that he need not accede to the demands of the Wali of Meshed for increased revenue if he considers them excessive, that his own terms will be considered sufficient. The letter has raiher disconcerted the emissaries from Meshed. 27th August .—Received a visit from the Amir Hashmut-ul-Mulk, who was very pleased with some photographs of Seistan which I showed him. 28th August .—Received a visit from the Intizam-i-Diwan, one of the Meshed emissaries. 29th —When paying a visit to Mr. Miller be took me -over the very extensive addition which he has made to what was already the best house here. He complained of being very cramped for room, but ht had nevertheless built two big blocks of buildings besides good stables. He said that they were intended for the doctor whom he expected later, and who might bring his wife with him. The remainder of the buildings were quarters for his cossacks, and a room and office for the establishment of his chancellery. He remarked that I w’as so much more fortunate than he was in having unlimited space, and added that his Government were foolish to pay a high rent for his house which was in a bau position, instead of purchasing out and out a good site such as the British Government had done. I said nothing, but it is curious he should have the idea we have bought our site. The Amir told methat it was impossible for him to sell me a site in Seistan, but that I was we * come to any site, or land I liked Had Mr. Miller acquired a site like I did, an spent the same amount of money on it, as he has done on his hired building, the Russian Consulate would have been a very imposing well situated building, and women have compared very favourably with our small mud huts erected as shelters against the sun. Once having spent the amount of money he has, it is not probable that he will be able to alter the position of his Consulate. 30 th August. —Mr. Miller visited Mustophi Khalik Khan, and for one hour tried to induce him to arrange a meeting between him and the Sartip, but the Mustophi said that was impossible. Mr. Miller in the evening lamented the unfortunate occurrence. He said to me you can understand how bad it is for me, and added that if he could have acted on his own discretion he would have called on the Sartip immediately after me. The Eastern Persian-Afghan Border. Colonel Temple sent me a copy of a telegram he had received from Tehran, stating that a “ manur ” or emissary was to be sent to enquire into the matter as the change of bed of the Helmund river caused apprehension but that the matter would rest until the return of the Shah. Affairs on the position show slight unrest but the condition is considered by the Amir and the Seistanis to be normal. The Hashmut-ul-Mulk s message to the Amir of Cabul, which is public property, is not conducive to harmony. At present however there is no cause for anxiety. NASRATABAD; G. CHENEVTX-TRENCH, Major, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan0 Dated Seistan, the 20 th August 1900 (Secret). From— Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to enclose a note I have written on Sardar Saiyid Khan, Naroi Baluch. As the role which this Sardar plays in Seistan may he the most important feature in local politics, I have written all that I can find out about his antecedents and his actions up to date. The Sardar is a refugee from both Afghanistan and Seistan. At present he appears to offer himself to the highest bidder. The question is whether in any circumstances the Government of India would be prepared to treat with him. As the leading Baluch Sardar of the Afghan-Baluch-Seistan border, he commands the Baluchis at present occupying the position of being just beyond the rule of the Government of India, outside the sphere of influence from Kabul, and averse to Persian rule, whose subjects, if these semi-inde pendent people can be called by that name, they nominally are. The Baluchis of this border are fine men, their clansmen extend south to the ill-defined portion of country, known as Sarhad, to the south of the Nushki route, and through them to that part of the country known as Persian Baluch istan. Their sympathies are entirely towards the Indian Government, and they look with contempt on the rule of the Persians. Should affairs in Afghanistan and Persia force the Indian Government towards the Helmand, it would be of importance to find these Baluchis ready to hand to be formed into levies, &amp;c. The attitude of their leading chief would influence them powerfully. Though not such an important Sardar as Saiyid Khan, Khan Jahan Khan, who has thrown in his lot with him, may still be considered as the next leading Sardar of the Baluchis, and my suggestions for treating with Sardar Saiyid Khan may be considered in a lesser way with reference to him. Although at present these Sardars with their hope of being allowed to return to Seistan, to live among their people, have not recently shown any desire to break the peace, they with their follow ing are the only internal (if I may use the word wuth reference to the Baluchis) element which might cause disorder in this country. These two Sardars have at various times hinted to British officers fprmerly in Seistan their desire to come under the protection of the Indian Government. On the other hand, I have reason to believe that overtures have been made to these Sardars on the part of the Russians v 7 hen they were in Meshed—overtures which were refused probably on the ground that, as long as there was hope from the Indian Government and a chance of returning to Seistan, they would not seek protection from Russia, so distant and unconnected with the Baluchis generally. Yet it may be within the political programme of the Russians to render some help to these Sardars, and so secure their influence, wdiile pleasing the Wali at Meshed, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk at Birjand, and the Sartip, or probable heir to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk in Seistan. This last ruler would be the only one who would be displeased to see the Sardars forced on his country, which would probably be the form which Russia’s help w r ould take. Por us to treat with these Sardars would be a delicate matter. The Russians could say nothing and do nothing, but the Persian Government at Meshed and the local Governor of Seistan might feel that the loss of influence over the border Baluchis was merely the thin end of the wedge, to eventually undermine the rights of the ruler of Seistan. On the other hand the Persian Government may from apathy and a desire to settle the question be only too agreeable to see the Sardars settled outside their country, and in this way remove what is now to them a troublesome question.2 Since I have heen here I have carefully avoided all action with regard to these Sardars that is not quite neutral. But now that we have in Seistan the Sartip Mir Mausum Khan openly at variance with his father over the treat ment of these Chiefs, intrigues will begin and the neutral position will become harder. Any serious intrigue in Seistan must play into the hands of our rivals and he to our detriment. It is for the Government of India to decide the policy towards these Chiefs, and whatever policy may he thought best, all the influence which has been acquired here shall he used to carry it through. A copy of this letter is being sent to Colonel Temple. Note on Sardar Saiyid Khan (Naroi), Baluch. Sardar Saiyid Khan is grandson of Alam Khan, Naroi, who as a Baluch Sardar held land in a part of Seistan now within Persian territory, but in his days under the sway of the Amir at Kabul. The following is the tree of the family of Alam Khan, Naroi, showing the near relations of Sardar Saiyid Khan :— Ala.m Khan, Naroi Baluch. Dost Muhammad Khan Sherif Khan I r 1 Darvesh Khan Saiyid Khan Muhammad All Khan Abbas Khan Alam Khan and Dost Muhammad Khan, his son, died in Seistan. At the time of the Goldsmid settlement, when that part of Seistan which belonged to Naroi tribe became an integral portion of Persia, Sherif Khan and Darvesh Khan, son of Dost Muhammad Khan, the living representatives of the tribe, left Seistan and offered their allegiance to Sher Ali, then Amir of Kabul. Sher Ali, who had always until the Goldsmid settlement regarded Seistan with its Baluch Sardars as within the claims of Afghanistan, treated these Naroi refugees with every respect, and giving them 80,000 krans, settled them in Kila Patch on the right hank of the Helmand, which was itself the newly recognised border between Seistan and Afghanistan. It was while these Naroi Sardars were in Kila Patch that they were able to give shelter and assistance to Amir Abdur Kahman, at that time a fugitive from Afghanistan. Crossing from Karan, Abdur Rahman reached Kila Patch in great distress, and was given money and horses by these Naroi Chiefs. This friendly act was not forgotten by Abdur Rahman when he became Amir. Sending for Sherif Khan and Darvesh Khan to Kabul, he bestowed on them “ khilats” and rewards, and sent them back again to Kila Patch, where they lived for several years. About the year 1894, Amir Ahdur Rahman again sent for Sherif Khan and Darvesh Khan to Kabul. During this visit to Kabul Sherif Khan died, and the Amir divided his property between his two sons, Saiyid Khan and Muhammad Ali Khan. Being suspicious of the conduct of Sardar Saiyid Khan on the Persian border, he ordered him to live in Bagistan (?) on some place in Northern Afghanistan. Saiyid Khan much objected to leaving Kila Patch, and on the pretence of settling his affairs in Kila Pateh went there before leaving for his place of banishment. At that time Sartip Mir Mausum Khan, son of the present Hashmat-ul- Mulk, was, though only a hoy, Deputy Governor of Seistan during the absence of his father at Tabas. The mother of Sartip Mir Mausum Khan is a sister3 of Sardar Saiyid Khan, and it is not to he wondered at that this border Chief tain connected as he was with Seistan should prefer again changing his alle giance from the Afghan Amir to that of his nephew ruling in Seistan, rather than being sent against his wishes to a distant part of Afghanistan by order of Amir Abdur Kahman. . collusion, therefore, with the Sartip Mir Mausum and his sister, Sardar Saiyid Khan crossed over from the Afghan side of the Helmand and was received with open arms by his sister and nephew. Many of the old hereditary villages of the Naroi tribe were conferred on him by the Sartip, and he with his sister exercised considerable control over the affairs of Seistan. When the news of the desertion of Sardar Saiyid Khan reached Kabul, the Amir Abdur Rahman sent for Darvesh Khan and Muhammad Ali Khan, and told them that, owing to the conduct of Sardar Saiyid Khan, they would have to leave the country. The two Sardars were transported to the Indian frontier at Peshawar, from where they eventually made their way through Quetta to Seistan. Darvesh Khan at the time of his expulsion from Afghanistan held a very high place in the estimation of the Amir, who had arranged to give him a daughter of the ruling family as a wife, and to make him a General in the Afghan army. On their arrival in Seistan the two Naroi Sardars presented themselves before the Sartip Mir Mausum Khan, and claimed the same privileges and honours as had been awarded to Sardar Saiyid Khan. This the Sartip refused to grant them, and they left for Tabas to press their claims before the Hashmat- ul-Mulk. At Tabas they were not well received, the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk refusing like the Sartip to recognise their claims to any lands in Seistan. Darvesh Khan and Muhammad Ali Khan, therefore, left for Tehran to lay their case before the Shah. The Shah granted them a firman and conferred on them certain lands in Seistan. On presenting this firman to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk at Tabas, he refused to recognise it in any way, and dismissed Darvesh Khan and Muhammad Ali. Darvesh Khan, the more leading spirit of the two Sardars, again started for Meshed, to report this independent action of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to the Wali there. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk, fearing perhaps the consequences of his action, and it is said at the instigation of Abdul Wahab, his Nazir, issued an order, in a fit of drunkenness, that Darvesh Khan should be waylaid on the way and murdered. Through the treachery of his servants, Darvesh Khan, who had only reached the first or second march from Tabas was induced to return, being assured that the Hashmat- ul-Mulk had relented and would now give him land and honour in Seistan. He returned only to meet his death at the hands of the assassins sent by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who were Khat Khuda Pakir, now Khat Khuda at Dodai, near Nasratabad, and Khat Khuda Ibrahim, since dead, together with some Serbaz. After this discreditable action, his arms and some jewels were brought to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk who was, it is said, greatly disturbed by the event, never realising what orders he had issued in his fits of drunkenness, but the death of this Naroi Sardar must always remain as a stain on the character of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. 'When the news of the murder of Darvesh Khan reached Seistan, Abbas Khan, son of Darvesh Khan, and Sardar Saiyid Khan, his cousin, at once left for Meshed in order to explain the whole circumstances to the Wali of that place. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk was sent for to Meshed to account for his actions, and was much threatened by the Persian authorities from Tehran. At one time an attempt was made on his life, and he had to seek refuge in the Persian “ bast ”. It was said that he would be removed from the rule of Seistan and Tabas, and otherwise punished. In the end Persian corruption prevailed over the sentiment of a punishment suitable to the crime, and on payment of heavy bribes all round, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk returned to rule over Tabas and Seistan.4 Later Tabas was removed from bis rule, but the reason was probably bis unwillingness to pay ratber than any punishment for the murder of Larvesh Khan. After the return of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk from Meshed, Sardar Saiyid Khan and Abbas Khan received from the Mali an order, granting them several villages in Seistan, in addition to those already granted to Sardar Saiyid Khan by the Sartip Mir Mausum, whereupon these two Sardars returned from Meshed to Seistan and occupied the villages. Some of these villages were in the former possession of the Sarbandis, a Persian tribe in Seistan, and on this account Sardar Purdil Khan representing the head of that division was greatly displeased at the prospect of the Baluch Narois becoming so powerful in Seistan, especially as they had been granted Sarbandi villages. Sardar Purdil Khan, therefore, with a large number of Khat Khudas interested in this alienation, left Seistan for Tabas, to lay their objections before the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The latter having recently escaped severe punishment in Meshed was not in a mood to ignore, as he had formerly, the orders of higher authorities at Meshed, and replied that he could not interfere with the orders of the Mali. Sardar Purdil Khan on receiving this answer determined to take action on his own account. Arriving in Seistan he went straight to Kila Nao, one of the villages recently taken possession of by the Naroi Sardars, and there informed Sardars Saiyid Khan and Abbas Khan * that they must either fight or leave the country. Saiyid Khan who had been joined by Khan Jahan Khan, whose daughter he had married, fortified themselves in a village called Khoja ‘Ahmed while Abbas Khan acted similarly in Kila Nao. The Sartip Mir Mausum Khan, whose sympathies were naturally on the side of Sardar Saiyid Khan, moved troops from the fort at Nasratabad to support him. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, however, hearing of this action, sent an order from Tabas that the Sartip was to withdraw his men and in no way to interfere. Both sides then prepared for the fight. Purdil Khan brought about 600 sowars and 100 foot to attack Abbas Khan in Kila Nao, who had as a defence to the village about 300 men. The fight ended in Sardar Purdil Khan gaining possession of the village, but fearing being himself besieged by Sardars Saiyid Khan and Jahan Khan, who had marched from Khoja Ahmed, he evacuated the village. On the arrival of Saiyid Khan (and ?) Jahan Khan, there was a consultation from both sides, and through the mediation of Khan Jahan Khan, it was agreed that Saiyid Khan and Abbas Khan should leave the country. They therefore crossed the Helmand and went to Kila Kang in Afghan territory. Later the Sartip Mir Mausum, who on assuming more power in Seistan had shown some oppression, was ousted from the rule of Seistan in favour of his brother, Muhammad Eeza Khan, Sarhang, under the orders of the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The story of the refusal at first of the Sartip to hand over the reins of Government to his brother, and the murder of Abdul Wahab, the instigator of the murder of Darvesh Khan, Naroi, and the connivance at the murder by the Sartip, are fully told by Khan Bahadur Maula Bux in his report (page 49). Abdul Wahab had been deputed by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to act as chief adviser to the Sarhang who was young and inexperienced at the time. It was he who carried on the negotiations during the period when the Sartip refused to evacuate the fort in favour of his brother, and his removal from the scene is not to be regretted after the part he played in the treacherous murder of Sardar Harvesh Khan. The Sartip, who was eventually induced to leave Seistan, took shelter with his uncle, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk at Birjand. His arrival there was the signal for Saiyid Khan and Khan Jahan and Abbas Khan to leave Kila Kan^ in Afghan territory and remove to Birjand, which they did. At Birjand they were well received by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, and it has been their object, with the help of the mother of the Sartip, and the Sartip to be allowed to return to Seistan and enjoy their rights over the lands granted to them by the Mali. bSardar Klian Jalian Khan, Sinjerani, has merely played the part of a partizan to Sardar Saiyid Khan, and refuses to return to Seistan without Sardar Saiyid Khan. Abbas Khan is at Birjand, and, being unconnected with the Sartip, has no desire to disturb the peace by returning to Seistan. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, having once got rid of Sardar Saiyid Khan, absolutely refuses to allow him to return, and the question has become one of some discord between him and the Sartip, who naturally is very anxious to see Sardar Saiyid Khan installed in Seistan, a place where he knows he will he appointed as Deputy Governor, should the Hashmat-ul-Mulk leave Seistan on a visit to Birjand or elsewhere. During the last three months there has been a discussion going on between the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Sartip at Birjand. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk ordered the Sartip to come to Seistan to act as Deputy Governor should he leave, while the Sartip has replied that he refuses to leave Birjand, unless the two Sardars, Khan Jahan and Saiyid Khan, are allowed to return. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk made no objection to the return of Sardar Khan Jahan Khan, but absolutely refused his sanction to the return of Sardar Saiyid Khan. The result of the struggle has been that the Sartip Mir Mausum has arrived in Seistan without the Sardars, and certain friction exists between him and his father. It is reported to me that the Sardars have left Birjand and come back again to the Afghan border, and will wait there until the Sartip is in sole power when they hope to move across. Another point in connection with Sardar Saiyid Khan and Jahan is that the recent emissaries from the Wali in Meshed to demand an increased revenue from the Hashmat-ul-Mulk have made the return of the Sardars, part of their mission to see carried out. The emissaries are still here. They have not as yet succeeded in extract ing the increased revenue from the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, nor have they been in any way able to get him to relent and allow the Sardars to return to Seistan. The 20th August 1900. ( ScL ) G ' Chenevix-Trbnch, Major, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consult Seistan. Foreign Office Presa—No. 1972—20.9-0Q—44.1 Meshed Confidential Diary No. 35 for week ending 30th August 1501. From Krasnovodsk I hear that six heavy guns have reached that place from Russia, and have been for the present detained there. I have received the following information from a traveller who has just returned from the direction of Panjdeh Much of it is known, but his description of the Kushk railway and the post at Shaikh Junaid may be of use. The present railway line between Merve and Shaikh Junaid passes by the following route. Starting from Merve the line follows the right bank of the river through Yulatan, Sultan Bund, Charvakh, Imambaba, Urush, Doshan, crossing the river at PuM-khishti, and going on to Shaikh Junaid. In the latter place the Russians have built a large fort, the circumference of which is about 20 miles. Ammunition and railway materials in large quantities have been stored inside the fort. There are underground fortifications. The walls of the fort are 10 to 12 yards thick. These w^alls are faced with masonry two yards thick, the inter vening space is filled with earth beaten hard. Shaikh Junaid is the terminus of the line and actually not a yard of railway extends be}ond, though all materials for the prolongation of the line are stored up in Shaikh Junaid. The bit of country lying between Pul-i-khishti and Takhta Bazaar was surveyed seven months ago wuth a view of connecting these two points by railway but through want of funds the project had been postponed. This line has been surveyed up to the Russo-Afghan frontier to a place called Killa Nao. Two projects, however, are said to engage the immediate attention of the Russian Government. 1. A railway line along the right bank of the Tajend river from Tajend to Sarakhs, vide my report in appendix to diary for week ending 16th August; 2nd, a line from Shaikh Junaid to Chahil Dukhteran, one of these lines it is said is to be prolonged to Seistan ! These projects were to be discussed during the visit of General Karopatkin to Sarakhs. * From Tajend in the direction of Sarakhs 4 or 5 miles of good road had been levelled. It was reported that either a macadamised road was going to be made or else a railway. My informant of the above news said that he Heard nothing about Russian canal schemes but much talk about railway projects. The Rais-ul-Tajar {vide my diary for week ending 28th June) together with the Mihmarbashi or head architect in Meshed, made a recent tour in the Caucasus. On their return journey to Askhabad they heard a great deal about projected Russian railway lines towards Persia. They saw railway materials all along the line collected in some quantities especially at the Arnao station near Askhabad. They saw everywhere signs of road construction towards the Persian frontier. From Arnao station to Kalta-Chenar the road had been completed They even report the construction of a road to Durbadam in the direction of Kuchan. At Durbadam they saw Russian engineers busy surveying and marking out roads with pegs. ^At Durbadam they report having seen Russian soldiers with the engineers - It was said that it had not yet been decided by the Russian engineers which line their road should follow to Kuchan. It was said, however, that the road w r ould emerge at Mulla Mahmud. It was said that Iksam-ul-Mulk, the Karguzar of Mahomedabad had tried to prevent the Russians from making this new route, but instructions had been sent to him from Tehran not to obstruct the Russians. It was reported that the Russians were making these surveys, and construct ing these roads, in virtue of an old concession which had been granted them some years previously, and that there was nothing new in the matter. Khusso Khan, Governor of Durbadam, had also received orders not to obstruct the Russians. An official at Bajgira, on the Perso-Russian frontier informed the architect that the Russians were in the habit of exercising their troops in the mountains near the Russian border. Every one said that the new works in the direction of Kuchan w r ere to be a railway which was to pass Meshed, go through Seistan, and reach Bunder Abbas. In connection with the above reports, the following is a copy of a telegram, sent by the Karguzar of Mahomedabad to Meshed * * * t “ It is now a month th^t the Russians have been engaged in surveying taking heights of mountains and making plans. Thet have pegged out from Darrahka, Darungar to Kaltechenar, and west of Darungar, where they reached and then divided into various parties and then worked east. Daragez to Kaleh Sang Zulagh to south of river Darungar route finished and busy on Sabz Darrah Datanar for some days and afterwards from Zhoo to Durbadam Kuchan where they came out, that he accompanied them. In a few days will reach Kuchan, and then w-ill return to Mahomedabad. M The Reis-ul-Tajar paid me a private visit, and informed me personally of the above new's. He said that while in the Caucasus he saw many Russian troops on the move and asked me whether from my Reuter’s telegrams there w ? as anything, to warrant this moving of troops. He asked me whether if the Russians made a raihvay to Meshed through Kuchan by the route which I have mentioned above, thev w r ould have the right to run it on the Persian portion of the Askhabad road, a portion for which he has the concession for 90. years. He impressed upon me the general activity and talk of coming events which was going on in Russia, and in the Caucasus and Transcaspia owing to the advance we had made towards Seistan. His view of the situation was that it was somewhat critical. He endeavoured to persuade me to pay a visit to Tehran, where he said the actual struggle for supremacy in Persia was actually now going on. He impressed on me as others have done how entirely the Sadr Azim had sold his country to the Russians, how the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tehran, a mere pupil of the Sadr Azim had also entirely gone over to the Russian side. When in the Caucasus he told me that he had met the Persian Minister on his way from Petersburgh, and had had long talks with him. The Persian Minister seemed to have received great attentions from the Czar, and the Rus sian Government, he said that the Russian concess : ons, such as the road from Resht to Tehran and the Russian Bank, had been of no benefit to the Russian Government. This the Reis-ul-Tajar said was untrue, and the Persian Minister knew it to be untrue when he said it. The Persian Minister abused me very much and said my actions in Persia had been very high handed, etc. The Minister said that at present the Russians had had no immediate con cessions granted them, but he predicted that very shortly they would obtain a concession to make a railway to Bunder Abbas The Reis-ul-Tajar s^id that the original 10 years’ agreement that no one should make railways in Persia, but the 2Ru ssian Government, being now nearly up the Russians he considered were poss bly busy planning some future, and similar arrangement or else they wished to show that they had made some beginning in railway construction prior to the expiration of the concession. He said he did not consider Russia could find money for any really big railway projects at present, nor did he believe Russia could find the money to meet the loan of 40,000,000 roubles which Persia was seeking to obtain. He was astonished to see the want of all progress in the Caucasus, and the inability of the Russians to develope the natural resources of their country. The rumours and reports about these Russian road and rail projects, I tele graphed to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, asking at the same time whether anything was known about them in Tehran, or whether it was true that, as the Russians stated, permission had been given to conduct water from the Persian side of frontier for the use of the stations on the Russian railway. The Governor here also received a telegram from Tehran asking on him to report what these rumours are. The Governor who is very friendly with us compared notes with my information and corroborated most of the reports, and said he would telegraph to Tehran and report the Russian movements on the frontier, asking us at the same time to keep him informed of what information we may receive. It is difficult to say what he will actually report. In any case we will do our best to turn the attentions of His Majesty the Shah to his northern neighbours advancing intentions, and distract his thoughts from our own politi cal position in Seistan. I have before reported that the Dragoman of the Russian Consulate Mr. Stroeff had been deputed to the district of Daragez. 1 have sent several men towards Daragez and towards Karez. Although there is a paid news-writer at Daragez, and I receive weekly letters from him, none of the above information has been received through him. Such is the apathetic state which news-writers reach if left too long alone in one place. I have frequently mentioned the prevailing apathy of Persia, and the effect it is liable to have on all I have now sent a full report to the Government of India on this subject proposing that fresh and specially selected men should be appointed to collect news at important places in Persia. My native officer with two sowars leaves here to-morrow for Karez. He will unostentatiously make a tour along the whole Perso-Russian frontier from Karez to Daragez. I received a letter from the Naib-ul-Hukumat at Herat, asking me to release Ghulam Khan, the camelman, who had been caught bringing rifles into Persia. He said the rifles were required for personal security. In reply I pointed out to the Naib-ul-Hukumat that the importation of arms into Persia was prohibited, that the Consul here and at Bunder Abbas would aid in every way the Customs Department to catch importers. I reminded him that 26 newly packed rifles were not rifles for personal pro tection, and 1 asked that notice should be given in Herat about the prohibition of rifles in Persia. The seizure of rifles will have had a good effect. Indirectly it will benefit the Seistan route, as the arms traffic by the Bunder Abbas route was an attrac tion of that route. Amir Abdur Rahman has sent a firman here to his agent ordering him to induce all Afghan refugees to return to their country. Bolan Khan, horse-dealer at Quetta, arrived here from Quetta by the Nushki route. He informed me, that he had been ordered to take to India some Persian mules, even as few as ten His orders were to take them out of the country 34 quietly, owing to the strict surveillance over all exports and imports by Belgian officers in the Customs Department, it was impossible to entertain the idea of his taking mules to India without.full authority from the Persian Government. Appli cation was therefore made to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran for leave to export mules. Mule export.from Persia is as far as I know prohibited. I made a present to the Naiur-ud-Dowlah, the Governor of Khorasan of an English saddle, and a gun. The Governor has been very friendly with us, and has in many uays safe guarded our interests. 1 In private conversations he assures me of the hold the Russians have crot in Persia through the Sadr-i-Azim, who is now completely in their hands. The Naiur-ud-DowIah is not in the least afraid of the Russian Consul-Genera 1 r ere ’ji - e l atter warned him at a private interview that if he continued to be so friendly with the English, he would be turned out of the Governorship. I have, on the other hand, told the Naiur-ud-Dowlah that he will have our support against intrigues. Mahomed Akram Khan, the caravanbashi, who came to Meshed with the Patna INawabs, gave them a great deal of trouble on the way, black mailing them at every turn. This man went to Quetta with a caravan belonging to Seth Sulei man, and gave a great deal of trouble. He spread bad reports about the route I beheve he was in the pay of Mr. Miller, and brought him information.

Mr. Foley from the Indian Tea Association and Mr. Ouseley from Dehra Dun are both here studying the prospects of introducing more Indian tea into Persia, and even forcing it by this route into Russia. They will send in full reports, but their opinion I may say is that with cer tain alterations, and certain arrangements the tea prospects are good. They con sider that all the tea planters in India should form themselves into a Trust, on the American principle, and command the tea supply for Persia. The Agents of the Trust should be at Quetta, and Persian dealers should eventually he forced to come there for their tea. They notice that at present the Persian will not give large orders direct on India, having no knowledge of the country, and no confidence; that tea must in the first place be brought to Persia and sold to the Persian that a peculiar tea known as white tipped tea is the tea which is most popular in Persia, this tea I am informed is very simple to make. This white tipped tea has not been made much in India, because the London market makes no demand for it, requiring only strong teas. The tea for Persia coming from Java. As regards the Russian market Mr. Foley informs me that it would be neces sary to go back to Chinese methods of hiring, and even Chinese leaf of tea to suit Russian tastes is to be produced. Mr. Ouseley who brings with him Indian tea grown from the Chinese plant sees no difficulty in again reverting to the Chinese method of Hiring for the Russian market, Mr. Foley considers that with the full flavoured teas of Assam so suitable for the London market, there would be some difficulty in removing what the Russians consider the harshness of the Indian tea. I have received the following information regarding duties, etc., from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Batoum, and His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Tehran.

I Have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India with reference to my telegrams Nos. 159, 161 and 165, dated 6 th, 7th and 9th July, respectively, a copy of a report submitted by me to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India for Khorasan and Seistan, on the subject of recent events which have taken place on the Seistan-Afghan frontier. No. 172 , dated Seistan, the 14 th July 1902 . From —Major R. A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain, To— Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. Whyte, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India for Khorasan and Seistan. In continuation of my telegrams to the Government of India, Nos. 159, 161 and 165, dated 6 th, 7th and 9th July 1902, copies of which have already been sent to you, I have the honour to submit the following report on recent events which have taken place on the Seistan-Afghan frontier. 2 . Colonel Chenevix-Trench’s diary, No. 6 , for the period ending 25th May 1900, with its accompanying map, very clearly demonstrates the rival claims to territory put forward by the Persians and Afghans, respectively. His statement of the situation in 1900 also accurately describes the condition of affairs existing at the present moment on the frontier. 3. It will be seen that near Milak, a village a little to the north of the Seistan Bund or Bund-i-Kuhak, is the point of bifurcation of the old and new bed of the Helmund river. The Goldsmid award fixed the boundary along the old bed as far as Kurki, where the river became the Naizar or reed swamp, and from thence in a north-west direction across the Naizar (then under water) to the Siah Koh. Since those days the Helmund has taken a more westerly course, the old Naizar has become dry and has shifted to the west, and the point where the Helmund water now penetrates the new Naizar is some 12 miles to the west at Gola Kulah. The Afghans maintain that the old bed has become obliterated, and that, with its obliteration, the Goldsmid award becomes null and void. They claim the new bed along the Bud-i-Pariun as far as the new Naizar. The Persians assert that the old bed can still be traced, and that, whatever geographical changes may have taken place in the locality, the Goldsmid award must still hold good. 4. I am not in a position to state what circumstances have given rise to the present deputation of an Afghan Boundary Commissioner for the redelimitation of the frontier, or whether the Persian Government were previously warned of the intention of the Afghan Government to send such a Commission to the Seistan border. It would seem, however, that as a result of Colonel Trench’s visit to the frontier in March 1901 {vide Colonel Trench’s diary for 15th March 1901) which was necessitated by the frequent disputes then taking place between Afghan and Persian subjects on the border, His Highness the Amir of Kabul asked the Indian Government for a copy of the map illustratino- General Goldsmid’s arbitral opinion. Armed with this map, an Afghan Boundary Commissioner from Herat Muhammad Musa (or Isa) Khan, appeared with a large escort and guns on the IrA2 frontier in the end of January last. He pitched his camp near Deh Dost Muhammad on disputed territory; hut eventually withdrew to 1 g an s i . 5. A reference to the Seistan diaries will show that between February and July of this year no less than 4 deputations were sent by ® s Governor of Chakansur, Fakir Muhammad Khan, Akhundzatla, to. int o rm the local Governor, the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk (now absent m Birjand), ot tiie arrival of the Boundary Commissioner from Herat, and inviting him to send the Persian representative to the frontier to discuss the redelimitation question. On the first occasion, the Seistan Governor replied somewhat tardily that, as no Persian representative had arrived yet, the matter might he postponed or a month or so. On the other occasions, the Akhundzada’s invitations were met either with no response at all, or with only evasive answers from the local Government. Both the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Karguzar of Seistan had also left Seistan in the meanwhile. Piqued by the discourteous treatment he was receiving, and interpreting it to mean an intentional evasion of the frontier question, the Akhundzada seems to have decided to cross the disputed frontier line into Persian territory to provoke the Seistan authorities to take some notice of his repeated requests, and thus to bring matters to a head. On 22nd June, he wrote to the Deputy Governor, asking for permission to visit him at his capital, and hinted that he would bring a large escort with him. He also let it be understood that, if the reply was unfavourable, he proposed pitching his camp at Deh Dost Muhammad forthwith. The Deputy Governor replied that he could not allow him to enter Persian territory with an armed force; but that, if he would come with a few unarmed men, he would be welcomed as a guest. The Akhundzada thereupon crossed the frontier with all his troops and pitched camp close to Deh Dost Muhammad. This was about the 29th June. 6 . Previous to this, however, during the five months mentioned above, the Afghans had made two attempts to provoke the Persian authorities to take action. During the first week in April it was reported that the Akhundzada had arrested, near Jellalabad in Persian territory, a Persian subject who was collecting grazing-tax. This report seems to have been exaggerated, and it would appear that the Akhundzada—claiming the new Helmund bed as his boundary—merely protested against the Persians collecting taxes at Jellalabad. On loth April, at a time when there was a great scarcity of water in the Helmund, reports reached me that the Afghans had partially destroyed the Seistan Bund at Kuhak, so as to allow of a good flow of water reaching a point lower down stream, called Chah Gul, where they had made a dam to conduct the water into Afghan territory. This dam had the effect of tempo rarily cutting off the Miankangi district from water, or at any rate of seriously reducing its supply. Sardar Purdil Khan, the Sarbandi Chief, was deputed to repair the Seistan Bund and to interview the Akhundzada. The affair is said to have been settled amicably and satisfactorily. Shortly afterwards a flood in the Helmund gave every one a plentiful supply of water. The harvest was in no w ay damaged by this incident. On the other hand, it is said to be the best that has been experienced for many years. 7. To return to the action of the Akhundzada. Hearing of the Afghan Governor’s intention to cross the frontier, M. Molitor, Director of Customs in Seistan, hurried out to Deh Dost Muhammad with a small force of the ¥amin-i- Nizam’s troops; but found the Akhundzada already there. He asked him to retire, pointing out that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persian territory was forbidden. It is said that the Akhund zada declined to discuss the question with M. Molitor, as being only a Customs official. M. Molitor then w'rote to the Governor to send out a force of cavalry to his assistance. ^ 8 . Meanwhile M. Miller, the Russian Consul, had written to the Deputy Governor (the letter was read by Dr. Ghulam Gelani, our Hospital Assistant who was attending the Governor’s Secretary, who allowed him to see it) to the3 effect that, as the Akhundzada was coming to Seistan to see the British Consul at the latter’s instigation, he desired to be informed what steps the local Government proposed taking to prevent a foreign Governor entering Persian territory. The Deputy Governor replied that the Akhundzada’s coming to Seistan was a mere rumour, and that his entry into Persian territory would be opposed. 9. W lien the troops M. Molitor had asked for reached Deh Dost Muhammad, M. Molitor returned to Seistan and immediately visited M. Miller and the Yamin-i-Nizam. The following day the Yamin had an interview with M. Miller, at the conclusion of which both he and the Russian Consul left the Russian Consulate together and visited M. Molitor. The three then proceeded to the city to see the Deputy Governor. (M. Molitor subsequently explained to me that this joint meeting at the house of the Deputy Governor was a pure coincidence.) At this interview M. Miller is said to have explained to the Governor that, according to M. Molitor’s reports, the Akhundzada had been allowed to enter Persian territory. He requested the Governor to order out all the local troops and to resist the invader by force. It is stated that M. Miller offered the assist ance of his own Cossacks. At the same time he demanded 30 men as a guard for the Russian Consulate, representing that Seistan was now in a state of insecurity. Orders were at once issued for 300 men from the border villages to con centrate under Sardar Purdil Khan on the frontier. Ammunition and gun powder were distributed to all the troops in the capital itself. On the conclusion of the interview, M. Molitor hurried back to Deh Dost Muhammad, where he met the Akhundzada, who again refused to discuss the the question with him, but stated his intention of collecting revenue from the village. 10 . The same evening (4th July) the Yamin-i-Nizam left Seistan with all his troops and two guns, and camped at Siadak {vide Colonel Trench’s map), about 2 J miles south of Deh Dost Muhammad. 11 . Leaving Sardar Purdil Khan and his troops at Deh Dost Muhammad, M. Molitor returned to Seistan. He paid me a visit, and explained to me that he had carefully avoided discussing the frontier question with the Akhundzada in its political aspect, and had posed as a Customs officer only. He said he had sent out a Persian flag which was flying in the village of Deh Dost Muham mad. He maintained that he had done his best to avert a conflict, but added that certain hostile influences were at work winch might tend to provoke disturbances on the frontier. He did not disguise the fact that he referred to M. Miller. On the 8 th July, M. Molitor completed his report on the action he had taken and asked the Deputy Governor to countersign it. This the Deputy Governor refused to do. 12. During M. Molitor’s absence on the frontier, the Russian Consul had written letters to the Deputy Governor and the Yamin-i-Nizam. He asked the former for an official explanation of his action in allowing an armed force belonging to a foreign power to enter Seistan. The Deputy Governor (as he subsequently complained to me) was much annoyed at this “ piece of interference ”, and in a short but polite reply told the Russian Consul that the matter only concerned the Persian Govern ment. The above was afterwards corroborated by M. Miller’s Mirza who told my Head Clerk. The second letter was addressed to the Yamin-i-Nizam in the same strain as above, and warned the Yamin to oppose the Akhundzada by force M. Miller had also been able—through Passand Khan, the Baluch in charge of his postal arrangements—to establish communication with one Atta Muham mad, Sinjerani Baluch, Katkhuda of Chahar Bujak, a man wffio has considerable influence with, and a personal friend of, the Akhundzada. My agent, who is also a personal friend of the Afghan Governor and is admitted to his Durbar, reported that Atta Muhammad received instructions from the Russian Consul, and at all the meetings incited the Akhundzada to make use of his superior guns and troops against the Persians. nt&gt;4 13. Thus everything pointed to the fact M. Miller was trying to gond both sides to a conflict. It was necessary, therefore, to counteract these intrigues and to avert a disturbance. The difficulty of the situation was aggravated by the animosity existing between the local authorities and the Yamin-i-Nizam. Instead of making common cause to circumvent a mutual enemy, the two factions acted inde pendently with the object of bringing some charge or excuse for report on the other. Purdil Khan refused to take orders or to consult with the Yamin-i- R izam. A further element of danger, and one which M. Miller was aware of, existed in the fact that Purdil Khan—himself an impetuous character—was in charge of a horde of undisciplined troops, who had been worked up, like the rest of Seistan, into the belief that their country was being invaded, and that nothing but an appeal to arms could save it. Under such conditions and with the two forces marshalled opposite each other—the one Sunni, the other Shiah it was possible that even the accidental discharge of a rifle might fan the popular excitement into a flame. The extreme seriousness with which the situation was regarded may be gathered from the fact that, before their departure for the- frontier, both M. Molitor and his Persian Interpreter left formal instructions- for the disposal of their private property and papers in the event of their not returning alive. 14. Meanwhile I had obtained two interviews with the Deputy Governor. I impressed on him the necessity of carrying out his negotiations with the Akhundzada with all international courtesy, and urged him to warn his representatives on the border on no account to resort to force of arms. I reminded him of Article VI of the Treaty of 1857, and pointed out that the only foreign Power which could intervene—should the necessity arise was Great Britain. As His Britannic Majesty’s representative here, I said I was prepared to do so if appealed to by both parties and on being authorised by my Gov ernment, but I expressed a hope that his own diplomatic skill would render such a course unnecessary. Thanking me, the Governor promised to write to the Yamin-i-Nizam and Sardar Purdil Khan on the subject. 15. Up to this time the Afghan and Persian representatives had not met, though verbal messages of a somewhat bellicose nature had passed between them. The Akhundzada also threatened to move his camp to Jellalabad on the east bank of the Rud-i-Dashak, a branch of the new bed of the Helmund. 16. At this juncture I wrote a letter to the Akhundzada, with whom, as already reported, 1 am on very friendly terms. With my letter I sent him a present of a Persian copy of the “ Life of Amir Abdur Rahman ”. I briefly expressed a hope that his negotiations with the Persian authorities would be carried out with all that diplomatic courtesy which was the characteristic of his country. I charged my agent, who, though an Afghan, is a British subject and a resident of Bannu, to warn him verbally that there were certain people in Seistan who, in order to benefit themselves, would welcome a disturbance on the Afghan frontier, and who were now engaged in trying to bring about that end. While discussing the contents of my letter, a letter from the Yamin-i- Nizam arrived—the first that the Akhundzada had received from him. My agent heard its contents, which were not of a courteous nature. The Yamin informed the Afghan Governor that he could not cross into Persian territory with impunity, and pointed out that the Persian Government had guns and “ Cossacks ” behind them. The Akhundzada summoned the Commandant of the troops and the Boun dary Commissioner to help him in framing a reply. My agent was also invited to attend. The two military members, it is said, recommended the despatch of an ultimatum calling on the Yamin to retire. After some discussion, during which my letter was again read, it was decided to send a temperate reply. The Akhundzada sent me a copy of this reply, written in his own handwriting, to assure me that he had followed my advice. A copy, with translation, is attached for your information. In it, it will be seen, the Akhundzada concludes hy inviting an interview, and asks the Yamin-i-Nizam to fix the rendezvous. Inreply to this, the Yamin invited the Akhundzada to meet him at his camp at Siadak, bringing with him only 15 men. 17. The interview took place on the 10th July at Siadak. It was decided (11 That as the maps in possession of the Persian and Afghan represent atives do not appear to agree, and that as no definite decision regarding the boundary can, therefore, he arrived at for the present, the matter should be referred for orders to Tehran and Kabul, respectively. (2) That pending the receipt of orders from their Governments, both parties should retire from the frontier. The Akhundzada, though he dismissed his troops, was at first inclined to remain at Deh Dost Muhammad with a small escort, there to await his orders. He is now said to have retired to his own residence at Kila-i-Kang, and the Yamin-i-Nizam and Sardar Purdil Khan have now returned with all their troops to Seistan. , . 18. Thus the frontier difficulty, which aggravated, there is little doubt, by the Russian Consul, at one time threatened to reach a crisis, has been—at least for the present—amicably settled. The opportune arrival of my letter to the Akhundzada was, perhaps, merely a coincidence; but it would seem to ha\ e influenced him in no small degree to adopt a temperate course. 19. I would now venture to bring to your notice the following points : (a) That although I was present in Seistan throughout this affair, and at the disposal of the local Government should they have needed my advice yet both M. Molitor and the Yamin-i-Nizam appear to have sought the Russian Consul’s opinion and assistance on every occasion before taking action. (b) That the Russian Consul, feigning concern for the safety of his Con- sulate in the event of frontier disturbances, aggravated the situ ation, and endeavoured to bring about a conflict between the Persian and Afghan representatives. (c) That with the object of lowering our prestige in the eyes of the Per sians, he represented that I had instigated the Akhundzada to enter Persian territory. (d) That the Local Government are themselves in. a great measure responsible for recent events on account of their persistent refusal to treat with the Afghan Governor. As regards (a), I venture to think that, if the local officials stood in need of advice—and their visits to the Russian Consul would seem to show that thev did—it was at the British, and not at the Russian Consulate, that they m iJht have sought it. Their latest action would seem. to suggest the fact tlmt even in Seistan, where British interests are admitted to be paramount and British trade predominant, an opinion prevails that it is to the Russian Government that Persia must look in an emergency. As regards ( 6 ), the Russian Consul’s action—if it was not an attempt to. develop a scheme with a more important or far-reaching object—was a distinct pflort to embroil matters in Seistan, and thus furnish an excuse for the despatch of either Cossacks to keep order, or a further supply of Persian troops to swamp Seistan and live at the expense of a Governor who is inclined to favour our oncosts • As regards (c), beyond the fact that the Akhundzada had asked me to lend him two tents in the event of his coming to visit the local Governor, and that the different Afghan deputations which arrived here were invariably the guests of the British Consulate—always a source of some irritation to M. Miller—I do not know what grounds the Russian Consul had for suggesting that I was responsible for the Akhundzada’s actions. As regards {d) as the Local Government were apparently without maps or Treaties they could not, perhaps, have adopted any other policy but that of procrastination. But it would seem strange that during a period of five months6 they were unable to procure these documents. It appears also from confidential information given me by M. Molitor that, as a result of their applications to Tehran or Meshed for the despatch of a Boundary Commissioner, an official (the Yamin-i-Nizam) has been sent who is not authorised to undertake the duty, nor is in possession of any maps or documents regarding the boundary. It is not actually known, hut it is, perhaps, pardonable fc&gt; assume that the map the Yamin showed to the Akhundzada was supplied to him by M. Miller. 20 . I will not venture to discuss the merits of the respective claims of the Persians and Afghans on the frontier. The question is one which, unless the Afghans accept the Goldsmid award, will develop into some importance. If the Afghan contention, that the obliteration of the old Helmund bed renders the Goldsmid award null and void, be considered as admissible, then I venture to think that it will be necessary to have the disputed portion of country resurveyed, with a view to deciding whether the old bed is traceable or not. If it be dismissed, it will, I think, then be necessary to retrace the old Helm and river bed, which now offers no very distinct natural landmark, and to demarcate the Goldsmid boundary with pillars on the ground. 21. Copies of this report are under despatch to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, and to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan. Translation of a letter from Akhundzada Fakir Muhammad Khan, Governor of Chakansur, to Yamin-i-Nizam, Officer in charge of the Seistan frontier. After compliments .—I am in receipt of your kind letter, and greatly rejoice to learn that you are in good health. You have written to say that I have made an encroachment on the Persian frontier, and that this is contrary to the principles of the laws of nations, and that, as excitement has been caused in Seistan, you fear lest a skirmish should take place which would be productive of annoyance between the two Muham madan Powers, and that you (Persians) are not of a cowardly spirit and have numerous excellent guns and rifles and brave soldiers. Dear Sir, leaving encroachments on Persian frontier aside, the devoted servants of the Khudadad (Afghan) Government have not even entered Persian territory yet, according to the official maps which were made in former times by capable servants of the two Muhammadan Governments in conjunction with the arbitrators of foreign Governments who came to Seistan. After the institu tion of enquiries, and the ascertainment of facts, the boundary line was distinctly shown in the maps. One map was given to the Persian Commis sioners, and the other was entrusted to the Afghan Commissioners. Of these maps you have one, whilst the other is in the possession of the servants of the Khudadad Government. Prom both these maps the boundary line is clear and apparent. By the grace of God, extremely friendly relations exist between the two high Islamic Powers, and enmity will never be thought of. It would be well if we interviewed each other, and if you kindly fixed a rendezvous. Telegram, No. 25 , dated the 1 st August 1902 . From—His Britannic Majesty^s Charge d J Affaires, Tehran, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please refer to correspondence regarding the Persian-Afghan boundary dispute. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh complains that Eakir Muhammad, Akhund zada, with an armed force, has occupied several Persian villages, and asks that orders may be sent to prevent such encroachments pending a settlement of boundary line. This telegram was sent to the Poreign Office, London, and repeated to the Poreign Secretary, India. Farjign Office Preas—No. 775—4-8.02—44.Seistan Mission Diary for the period ending the 28th April 1903. 23rd April 1903 .—Leaving the main camp at Khwaja Ahmad, I started with a small camp for the Seistan capital en route for Siah Koh. Captains Webb Ware and Ramsay and Messrs. Ward and Tate accompanied me. We crossed the Rod-i-Seistan hy boat at Burj-i-Sarband, and stayed the night at Jalai about 20 miles. It rained more or less all day, and, owing to flooded country, the going was bad. Jalai is only four miles from the city, but a short march to-morrow is desirable, as we have to make a ceremonial arrival at 10-30 A.M. 2 dth April .—We made a punctual start this morning, and proceeded in * I have complied strictly with the sanction given btate to the Capital. I WUS accompanied escort was increased on the road by the addition of Major Benn’s escort who met and joined us. About two miles from the city we were met by a large official “ istikbal ” consisting of the Governor’s two sons, Sartips Mir Masum Khan and Muham mad Raza Khan, Sardar Purdil Khan, some 150 sowars, and some led horses. These conducted us in ceremony round Hussainabad, past the Russian Con sulate and Nasratabad Fort to the British Consulate. Between Nasratabad and the British Consulate we rode through a double line of Persian infantry with their band. The British Consulate buildings were gorgeously decorated with flags. Major Benn received us at the Consulate, and entertained the reception party and ourselves with light refreshments after which the former took their leave. All our party have been accommodated in the British Consulate house and compound. During the morning the Hashmat-ul-Mulk sent over Mehmani and presents to the value of some 7 to 8,000 Krans, chiefly in the form of food- supplies. In the afternoon the Governor himself came and paid a formal visit. This visit appears to have been the cause of considerable discussion. The recognised Persian custom is that a big official is called on on arrival by all Persian officials, but not the Governor, who has to be called upon first. In the case of the Mission, the Governor had willingly agreed to pay the first visit, notwithstand ing efforts on the part of Mr. Miller to prevent it. He was to have come to call on me alone, but at the last moment, at the instigation apparently of Mr. Miller and against the Governor’s wish, the Karguzar and the Yamin-i-Nizam insisted on coming with him. The object was, as far as I can gather, to make the Governor at the last moment abandon his visit; but as he did not do so, the fact of the Karguzar and the Yamin-i-Nizam coming in his train only increased the importance of his visit, a result which was apparently not intended. The Hnshmat-ul-Mulk was very friendly. He is a pleasant mannered, old gentleman with a keen sense of humour. He gives one an impression of being more honest and straightforward than the Persian officials we have as yet met. Heavy rain fell in the afternoon and night. Nasj'atabadJ 25th April .—I returned the Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s visit this + I use the addresi Nasratabad as such appears morning, accompanied by Major Benn the custom with us. The Persians and Seistanis talk only of this place as the city (Shahr-i*SeisUn). Hussainabad, Nasratabad, and the old ruined Nasir- abad are merely small villages grouped closely together. Nasratabad differs from the others only in having a wall and moat round it. Just opposite to, and a few yards from, Nasratabad, while at the same time touching Hussainabad, is the British Consulate known as Trenchabad. and the officers and Native staff of the Mission. The Governor’s house, wdiich is inside the Nasratabad fort, was reached by narrow dirty lanes full of stagnant water, A more dilapidated and squalid set of mud hovels than the Governor’s palace I have never seen anywdiere. A. H. McMahon; Yesterday’s rain had brought down the building on one side of his courtyard,2 and the roof of the one on the other side in which we were received and enter tained by him was badly cracked and threatened at any moment to fall down also. The Governor received us hospitably, and we sat with him for some time. The Karguzar and the Yamin-i-Nizam had, it appears, tried to be present at our visit, but were met by the objection that the Governor had not enough chairs to accommodate them. Very heavy rain all the afternoon. A deputation of all the British subjects of Seistan visited me in the evening, and read an address followed by a lengthy poem by a local poet. In their address the traders asked for assistance in getting camel transport from Quetta to Seistan : a telegraph line and, if possible, a railway line to Seistan and abolition of the new Customs tariff. In number, the British subjects in Seistan make a goodly show. They seem well-to-do and afford, in appearance, a striking contrast to the Seistani residents. Mr. Miller, Dr. Miller, and Mons. Maurice came to dinner at the British Consulate, where we made their acquaintance for the first time. They all evinced great friendliness. Mr. Miller speaks English fluently, and is an enter taining man to talk to. He is well up in Indian affairs and closely studies the “ Pioneer”. Dr. Miller can only speak a smattering of English and Erench. Mons. Maurice only knows Erench. The evening was a very pleasant one. Nasratabad, 26th April .—In the evening I visited all the shops belonging to the British Indian traders, and which are situated in Nasratabad, Hussain- abad, and Trenchabad. These shops afford a pleasing contrast to the mean buildings around them, and are well built structures of the local dome- roofed pattern. It is very melancholy to think that the plucky efforts made to start Indian trade and the successful results attending those efforts are all now to be wiped out by the new Customs tariff. I visited the British Consulate Hospital, and had my first opportunity of going over the Consulate domain. The Consulate itself is a handsome and imposing building on a high plinth with a roof of many domes. It stands in a large enclosure surrounded by a high wall with an imposing entrance gate with domed guard house and treasury at either side. The old Consulate buildings, small mud huts without windows, are now used as out-houses. Major Benn is much to be con gratulated on the great improvements effected here by him, under most difficult circumstances. A handsome set of presents in return for his were sent by me to-day to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and his sons. I understand he was much pleased with them. Nasmtabad, 27th April .—My visit to the Seistan capital has given rise to considerable difficulties on the delicate subject of formalities in the shape of visits. The principal and important visit, i.e., by the Governor, has been duly made and returned. The general custom with regard to Europeans is for the new comer to call first on the residents. Under ordinary circumstances, I would have paid a formal call on Mr. Miller, but my doing so, after his attempted interference in the Governor’s first calling on me, would be used by him against the Governor. My position here, moreover, is not quite an ordinary one, which complicates the question still more. With the best intentions to do the right thino &gt; , I was unable to determine what the right thing was. Mr. Miller has so far made no sign of coming to call on me. A visit in Seistan implies first writing to inform the person to be called on of one’s wish to come, and then, after°a time has been mutually decided on, the call is made. After much deliberation I have decided not to make the first visit on Mr. Miller, but have deputed my Per sonal Assistant, Captain Bamsay, to call on him on his and my own behalf. Captain Bamsay accordingly paid visits to-day to Mr. and Dr. Miller, and also* called on Mons. Maurice and the Karguzar and Yamin-i-Nizam. The matter is a trivial one, but in a place like Seistan, where trivialities take precedence of important matters, one has to move circumspectly. I hardly expect to please every one, but the course adopted seems a fairly safe one between the Scylla of arrogant pretension and the Charybdis of gratuitous surrender.basratabad, 28th^ April .—I start this evening accompanied by Messrs. VV ard and Tate for Siah Koh. How we are going to get there remains to be seen. The present year is one of abnormal flood, and the Hamuns are extend ing their margins rapidly day by day, so that a route practicable one day may be impassable the next. We hope to cross the Hamun area to Baring, and then skirt the llamun to Siah Koh. The Persian Commissioners are not comin' with me. They have, as noted in. my diary entry of the 22nd April, a^ain returned to the old argument that their instructions do not include considera tion of the Seistan boundary line, which has been definitely settled years ago. They say they have telegraphed for instructions, but I hardly believe this. That their instructions are not quite as they state is proved by the manner in which they discussed the boundary line with me on the 18th instant and during our visit to Takht-i-Shah, &amp;c.. Their present objection to accompany me may be due to other causes, of which one is a disinclination to undergo hardships; another is the difficulty of getting transport, as the Governor so far seems to have given them none. The Yamin-i-Nizam has been very much with Mr. Miller during the last few days, and the latter has doubtless advised him in his present action. Report received to-day from Robat that the Mission post bag has been robbed somewhere on the other side of Robat. No particulars as yet forth coming, and no post bag received to-day.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a despatch which Major Douglas, Military Attache, has addressed to me, giving notes on his recent journey to Tehran through Seistan, Khorassan, and Trans-Caspia. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR, H. HARDINGE. Inclosure in No. 1. Major Douglas to Sir A. Hardinge. (No. 1 . Confidential.) Sir, Gulahek, June 4, 1903. I HAVE the honour to inclose some notes on the following subjects from informa tion collected during my journey from Seistan to Tehran :— 1 . The road from Seistan to Meshed. 2. The road from Meshed to Askabad. 3. Persian troops at Meshed. 4. The Trans-Caspian Railway. I also sent direct from Meshed to the Intelligence Branch in India a detailed description of my route from Seistan for incorporation in “ Routes in Persia.” During my stay in Askabad I called on the Governor, General Ussakovsky, whom 1 found extremely civil and pleasant; but my time there was so short that I had no opportunity of seeing anything of the troops, the majority of whom had already moved out of the town into their summer quarters. From my knowledge of Russian methods 1 had rather expected to find that their renewed demand for direct relations with Afghanistan had been accompanied by some sort of military display in Central Asia. So far, however, as I could ascertain from inquiries, there have been no unusual movements of troops during the present year, though there is little doubt that the fortified posts at Kushk, and other places on the Afghan frontier, are being steadily armed and strengthened, and made suitable for employment as bases in case of hostilities. In spite of rumours to the contrary that were current at Meshed, the recent dis turbances in that town do not appear to have called forth any noticeable military preparations in Askabad. . I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J. A. DOUGLAS, Major, Military Attache. - - Notes on the Route from Meshed to Seistan, via Turbat-i-Sheikh lam, Sangun, Ahingaran, and Duruh. [Note. —The route by which I travelled is almost the same as that traversed by Captain Smyth last year, the only difference being that I went direct from Gisha to Duruh, whereas he diverged here to Asparun, and that by avoiding the villages of Ahingaran and Bamrud I shortened the distance by a few miles. It must be remembered that this year was an exceptionally bad one as regards supplies, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that I could get grain for three animals and food for four men, so that in this respect I have seen the country at its worst. On the other hand, I left Seistan at the end of March, after an exceptionally wet and severe winter, and as regards the [2057 4] ’ b | Jo grazing*, &amp;c., the countrj was then probably at its best. I am considering the road chiefly with reference to its suitability for a force marching down from the north.] General Description of Country, Starting from Meshed, the road as far as Karat (108 miles) is over undulating country, covered with grass in the spring and well watered. The soil is either clay or sandy, and guns could be taken over all this with very little difficulty. There are no severe gradients, but the road would be heavy in parts after rain. From Karat the road rises to a low ‘‘kotal”; the ascent is gradual, the soil mostly soft, and carriages are sometimes taken over it; possibly a little work would be required to help guns or heavy transport carts over the top, but that is all. The descent to Sangun is easy. From Sangun to Ahingaran (77 miles) the track is over a plain the whole way. The soil is mostly sandy and firm, but in one place, between Bamrud and Ahingaran some rather heavy sand is crossed for about 4 miles; this could probably be turned. Otherwise there is nothing to delay wheeled transport. Beyond Ahingaran the Amrutak Pass is very difficult, and much work would be necessary before guns could be got over this part of the road. There is however another road which keeps outside the hills to the east, via Tajnud, and comes through them to Ahwaz, near Gazik (see “ Persian Route Book/’ section 3 , route 70, stao*e 5 ). rom inquiries, this road seems to be easy, keeping along the foot of the hills, but it is not much used, as it is longer and also, owing to its proximity to the Afghan frontier is much more exposed to raids. From Gazik to Seistan the track, speaking generally is across a succession of broad open valleys or plains, crossed for the most part with shrubs or sparse vegetation in the spring. The soil is either sandy or sand and gravel, and is good i Th ^ u aie T ^ tW °i ko ^ als ” ^ hich offer an -f diffi culty, viz., that between ti f U Husenabad, and the Gudar-i-Masham, between the latter place and Durah The first of these would require very little work; the latter is not so easy, and on the south side, where it descends a stony ravine, the road would require some making for amTston ° hi 18 nothing more di ffi cult than a short stretches of rough j going. Water. As far as Mijnabad (215 miles) there would be no difficulty in the way of water 10 m Mijnabad to Bamrud is a long stretch of 37 miles, and, except after ram there is watei only in the one well of Chakhpai, about half-way. This well is not more than 3feet m diameter and the water is 70feet below the surface; it is said to fill up quickly t '' l ,rom t, ■ Durnh) :- amUn ' S 103 mi,eS ’ with water as foll «^ (distances are from 1.

From thence there is nothing till Seistan is reached. Fodder and Grazing. As far as Sangun (200 miles) the country is covered with abundant grazing m the spring ; a great deal of lucerne is also grown, and there would be no di cu y m ee a large number of animals. Later in the year, when the grass is drie up, o ^ horses could probably be obtained, but camel-grazing is very scarce. J there is scarcely any grass, and that only in the early spring ; so tha _ oc er or would have to be collected from the villages. Camel-grazing, on the other hand, abun ^ a he t amount of grain and iodder procurable along the road would, of course, depend a good deal on the season of the year. r Ihe early spring- end of March and Apul offers many advantages : the country is green, there is more water, ie grazing better, and the standing crops could, if necessary, be cut for , p • ^ hand, the crops are not harvested till the end of June or July, and the so &amp; dried fodder (“ bhoosa,” &amp;c.) is consequently at its lowest. Summary. From the above it will be seen that to march anything but a small pwe Mong this route would not be altogether an easy task. There are two stretches °f &gt; 10 ™*'ese a oh, where, unless collected and stored beforehand, a considerable quantity of supp food for men and grain and fodder for horses-would have to be carried. V\ ater, too, would be a difficulty in some parts, especially between Duruh and beistan. Notes on the Road from Meshed to Askabad. This is a made road and carries a constant and fairly heavy traffic, consisting of carriages fourgons, and pack animals. The total distance from Meshed to Askabad is 176 miles Carriages can be hired in either Meshed or Askabad, and with tour horses thev do the journey in from four to six days, according to the state ot the load, the same horses going right through. There is no fixed rate of '' r c^ ut a car ' a g e ca “ usually be obtained at from 25 to 35 tomans and a fourgon for a little less, there are caravanserais at all the principal places along the route. Meshed to Kuchan. Aq far as Kuchan (98 miles) the road is practically level, the soil is mostly soft and r 1 ctrmpq the country is thickly populated, and tor the first &lt;0 miles or so the iree from stones the “^^“Vhe road is unmetalled, and when first made was probably a very fair track, bridged where necessary and drained by a ditch on each side thromdiout Judging by its present state, nothing has been done to keep it in repair since theTime tt was*first made, and several of the bridges have fallen in. Wherever there is the Hitches alone the sides of the road are used for purposes of irrigation and ^pSted to overflow Ml over it, In addition to this the Persians have a habit ol [2057 n —v] Persians have a habit oi B 24 viz Miles. Meshed to Chinaran Chinaran to Kuehan 42 56 Kuchan to Askabad. Beyond Kuchan the road to within 10 miles of Askabad is all among hills, and the usual stages are(1) Imam-Kuli, 23 miles; (2) Gaudan (the Russian frontier post), 27 miles ; (3) Askabad, 28 miles. This portion has been regularly graded and built up where necessary, and is kept in repair to some extent, gravel being thrownon occasion ally in places where it is very bad; but it is in no sense a metalled road. W hen 1 came over it, it was fair in parts, but for most of the way was very heavy, vtit.i mud m some places a foot deep. As the information given in “ Routes in Persia ” about this part ot the road is very out of date, I give it in greater detail. Kuchan to Imam-Kulu From Kuchan for the first 9 miles, as far as the village of Zuaran, the road ascends steadily over low spurs; thence there is a steep zigzag ascent of nearly 3 tmles, after which it descends into a small valley to the village of Mulla Muhammad (13 miles). After going about a mile up the valley there is another steep zigzag ascent over very heavy roads for some miles, then a descent, steep at first but afterwards more gradual, to the village of Imam-Kuli, which lies in another valley running a little to the north of west. Imam-Kuli to Gaudan. After leaving Imam-Kuli the road is down the valley for 10 miles to the village of Durbadam, alongside a tair-sized mountain stream. The stream is crossed three times by what looked substantial brick bridges, but the lowest and biggest of the three had fallen in a few days before I was there. The valley is very narrow in parts, between rocky hills. At Durbadam the stream turns northwards, and the road leaves it and goes up a side valley; this is a steady ascent, in one place through a gorge barely wide enough to allow two vehicles to pass. A few miles up the road leaves the valley and commences to ascend the range of hills to the north, rising rapidly by a long series of zigzags till the top is reached. On the north side the descent is fairly steep for miles, when the road again ascends and crosses two low watersheds before it reaches the valley in which the Persian frontier post of Bajgirha (24 miles) is situated. From the village there is a slight ascent to a low “ kotal ” at the head of the valley, which is on the actual frontier line, thence a descent of 2 miles to the Russian post of Gaudan. Gaudan to Askabad. Gaudan is situated near the head of a valley draining northwards, and the road, after leaving the post for the first few miles, keeps high up above the bed of the stream, then drops suddenly by a series of zig-zags to the bottom of the valley, and leads down it. After 14 miles the stream turns westwards, and the road descends over a low spur, then descends suddenly to the level of the plain, across which it goes direct for the lasto 10 miles into Askabad. This portion of the road is rather better than that in Persian territory, but is not regularly metalled till within about 7 miles of Askabad, and was very heavy in parts. Persian Troops at Meshed. During and after the riots at Meshed, I had some opportunities of seeing the Persian troops in that town. While rioting was actually in progress no organized bodies of troops were visible, and I believe the men openly gave out that they would not fire on the mob. When things had quieted down, however, a period of exceptional military activity set in, and the troops were paraded daily in the open square in front of the citadel, while a large number of irregular cavalry were brought into the town. Infantry. The regular infantry mustered 350, and after being served out with uniforms, which they had not formerly possessed, were set to drill on the square. They were armed entirely with old peicussion muskets, and were of all ages, the majority being either old men or young boys. The drill was ot the most primitive description, and, to judge by the degree of proficiency displayed, I should say that they had never received any training before, nor did they evince any anxiety to learn. In fact, they treated the whole thing as a joke, and after the first two days, when the distrust occasioned by so unusual a proceeding was commencing to wear off, the townspeople assembled in large numbers to watch their evolutions, and constant humorous remarks passed between them and tbe men in the ranks. The officers, who were not in uniform, w r ere as ignorant as the men, and the greater portion of the hour or so devoted to drill w r as spent in getting their commands into some sort of line in the position they were to occupy during the daily inspection by the Governor, who, with his son, tbe Commander-in-Chief, and a large staff, solemnly walked round at the conclusion of the proceedings. Artillery. In addition to the infantry, there were present on parade nine brass rifled M.L. guns of about 3 -inch diameter, and of native manufacture, each of which had a detach ment of six or seven men. These men, who were mostly Turks, and of a much better stamp Than the infantry soldier, were not provided with uniforms. They spent their time on parade in going through a sort of travesty of gun-drill, taking it in turns to ram and sponge, while occasionally one of the others went through the form of putting his thumb on the vent. Laying the gun was not practised, and the point to which most atten tion was paid was a wave of the right arm as the sponge was withdrawn with the left hand, and the man stepped out of the way. There were also three large antiquated smooth-bores in the artillery square, and there were said to be two small breech-loaders in the Governor’s palace. These latter I did not see, but they were probably the 7 -centim. Euchatius guns referred to in Colonel PicotV c Report on the Persian Army.” Cavalry. The cavalry consisted of a few of the Persian Cossack brigade (five or six) and others in a sort of Cossack uniform, making a total of about thirty, ot whom ten were armed with Berdan and the remainder with Werndl rifles. Then there were a body ot some 250 Timuri sowars, most of whom had old Werndl rifles, but about fifty were unarmed. Many of them were very old men ; they were mounted on small horses of a W Wn hrnnoht in from Kuchan and neighbourhood. They seemea to oe villager*6 o In addition to the above, the Fath-es-Sultan, the Governor’s son and Commander- in-chief, told me that he had 100 armed men of his own in the citadel. The Trans-Caspian Railway. This railway is now very comfortable, and, to the casual observer, is similar in eveiy respect to the ordinary railway of European Russia. The pace is slow, the rate, including stoppages, of the mail trains from Askabad to Krashovodsk being rather under 20 miles an hour. I was fortunate enough to find myself in the same compartment with an Englishmen! in the employ of a French firm of railway contractors in Moscow, who was travelling on duty connected with the railway. He told me that, though nominally taken over by the civil authorities, the line is still, to a great extent, under military control, the manager being an officer and three-quarters of the employes men of the railway battalion. As regards rolling-stock, he assured me that this is now ample for all requirements, and that if any large movements of troops were contemplated the principal difficulties to be contended with would be inferior management and organiza tion and want of water. He had the poorest opinion of the management of the line, which he described as “ the worst-managed railway in Russia,” and the scarcity of water on the greater portion of the Trans-Caspian section constitutes, he said, a very important factor in calculating the number of trains which could be run daily. The line, too, is badly laid, and incapable of carrying fast traffic. I could get no opinion from him as to the actual number of trains which could be run daily in case of necessity, but he thought it would be limited chiefly by the water difficulty, and appeared positive that the management would break down altogether under any exceptional strain. I may mention, also, that at that time (the middle of May) the line w r as very badly breached by floods at Tejend, and I met in Askabad several travellers who w 7 ere detained there and unable to get on to Tashkend in consequence. Judging from the newspaper reports, the damage done was serious, and some weeks would be required to thoroughly restore the line. (Signed) J. A. DOUGLAS, Major, Military Attache'. Tehran, June 4, 1903.Diary of Mr. H. Dobbs, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 15, for the period ending the 15th September 1903. Captain Ready left Seistan on 1st September. On his way to Shusp he found Mr. Moore, British signaller, wounded by robbers at Zainalabad. The incidents of the attack on Mr. Moore have been already reported by me in detail. On hearing of this event from Captain Ready, I left Nasratabad on the afternoon of the 5th instant, met Mr. Moore at Lab-i-Baring on the further side of the Hamun on 6 th September, and recrossed the Hamun with Mr. Moore the same night, reaching Nasratabad at noon on 7th September. I was, therefore, to my great regret unahle to be present at the functions held at Nasratabad on the morning of 7th September in honour of the birthday of His Majesty the Shah. I wrote immediately on my return to the Karguzar, com municating my regret at my unavoidable absence. 2. The condition of Seistan, and also of Kain, is becoming very disturbed. I am sorry to say that the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk is largely responsible for this, though not entirely through his own fault. In the first place, the constantly recurring rumours of his imminent deposition, which arrive here from Meshed, and which are also spread by the Russians and Belgians here, have somewhat weakened his authority with the people. I am informed that even Sardar Purdil Khan, his chief support, has recently threatened to secede from him, owing to some dispute about revenue demands. I do my best to contra dict these mischievous rumours ; but the Amir himself gives some credence to them, and they result in making him reckless, and dispose him to proceed entirely on the principle of carpe diem. In the second place, as I have already reported, the Amir has had to cut down the allowances to religious men, and has thus partially lost his principal support. In the third place, being driven to find money for a double pishkash, owing to the change of Governors-General at Meshed after the Nauroz, he is alienating many of the Katkhudas hy pushing to extremes the policy of giving each village to the highest bidder for the year. In the fourth place, the central Government has now instituted so many independent authorities in Seistan that the Amir, as he tells me, is beginning to feel himself an absolute cipher. There is the Yamin-i-Nizam, who interferes whenever possible, and sends continual tele grams on administrative matters to Tehran. There is the Karguzar, who is always trying to meddle in internal affairs in somewhat feeble rivalry with the Yamin. There is the Customs Department, which has arrogated to itself practically independent jurisdiction, and is even building, with hardly a show of consulting the Amir’s wishes, a fort near Lab-i-Baring, for the protection of the road to Birjand. A Passport officer is expected, clothed with consider able administration powers as regards the frontier; and the Director of Telegraphs is a silent spy on the Governor’s actions. The Shuja-ui-Mulk, Commander of the Kerai forces, is also practically independent of the local Government. Added to this is the fact that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk is actively intriguing against his brother, the Hashmat, from Birjand, and that Sardar Saiyid Khan, Narui, the Hashmat’s bitter enemy, is awaiting, under the protection of the Yamin, a restoration to his rights, and has the secret sympathies of his nephew, the Hashmat’s son, Sartip Mir Masum Khan. It is only about four years since the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk was all-powerful in Seistan; and it can be no matter for surprise that his moral fibre should now be giving way under the rapid change of circumstances. He has publicly declared that he is tired of trying to govern Seistan, and that he has formally petitioned the central Government to be allowed to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. I have questioned him several times on this subject, and pointed out to him how fatal to his position here would be such a step. But he says that he does not care, and wishes to prepare for the next world. I do not know whether the central Government is likely to give him the leave for which he has asked. If he 1 Cgoes, I believe his intention is to give the Deputy Governorship of half Seistan to Mir Masum Khan, and the other half to the latter s rival and half-brother, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan. I cannot conceive of an arrangement more likely to lead to anarchy in Seistan. 3 . Some of the unfortunate results of this reckless attitude on the part of the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk may now be noted. About three months ago, 108 camels were stolen from Afghanistan by men of Seistan, who are popularly believed to have been in the employment, or at all events under the Flec tion of the Amir. The Akhundzada sent the owners with one ot his Mirzas to Seistan to negotiate with the Amir for their return. These men have hung on in Nasratabad, appealing now to the Yamin-i-xsizam, now to the Karguzar to obtain the restitution of their camels. But, though it is generally believed that the Amir knows perfectly well where they are, only ten have hitherto been produced. While these negotiations have been pending, a series of violent robberies has taken place along the Afghan borders, both of Seistan and Kain, which are understood in Seistan to be reprisals on the part of the Afghans; though I believe this is denied by the Akhundzada. First of all about 25 camels were stolen from the Russian caravan near Hauz on the way to Birjand. As these camels were the property of men of Seistan and the loads were not stolen, the Russian Vice-Consul does not seem to have made any complaint. Then a raid was made into the Naizar, and about 60 head of cattle were driven off into Afghanistan from near Lab-i-Baring. Then came the attack on Mr. Moore at Anjira by 25 Afghans. The evidence points to these men having come directly from Lash Jawain, north of the Akhundzada’s territory; but the opinion of most natives of Seistan is that they were men from the Akhundzada’s territory; that they had intended to make a grand coup by ambuscading the great cavalcade of Saiyids who attended the chief priest of Seistan on his journey up to Meshed, on his way to Kerbela; and that this attack on Mr. Moore was a mistake. Then came news that a native of Sarbisha and four men of Duroh had been ambuscaded by 25 Afghans near Duroh in Kain, and the men of Duroh decapitated, their animals being killed, w T hile the man of Sarbisha was let go by the robbers, and told by them to give a message to the men of Seistan that it was the owners of the stolen camels who had committed the murder. Again, two days ago two men of Varmal were murdered, it is said by Afghans, at Safidawa, near Mukh-i-Surkh, on the road to Neh. This is a very formidable list of outrages; and, as I have said, whether rightly or wrongly, they are believed to be entirely due to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s action in not giving up the Afghan camels stolen. It is difficult to bring the Amir to see reason on the subject, as he meets all my remarks with the solemn asseveration that he knows nothing of the missing camels. 1 intend to try some very plain speaking with him on the subject in a day or two. 4. A certain Mir Said, brother of one of the Amir’s favourite servants, recently shot the Katkhuda of Dih Hussain in Miankangi in the course of a quarrel about wheat. The Amir is unwilling to punish the murderer, and this has created great excitement among the Saiyids (the aboriginal inhabitants of Miankangi), who threaten to emigrate to Afghanistan and to carry out reprisals on Seistan from there. 5. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk has received a more imperious summons than usual from the Governor-General of Meshed. But while apparently quite ready to go to Mecca (whither, he says, he should go by Bundar Abbas) he is much afraid of going north, for fear of never being allowed to come back! Things will, therefore, take their usual course. The Amir will scrape together a large present for the Governor-General; and the rising discontent in Seistan will be increased in the process. Nothing short of a great strengthening of the Amir’s position can save him and Seistan from this constant squeezing. If he were definitely assured of support from any source, he could disregard both the hostile reports against him of the Customs, the Yamin-i-Nizam °&amp;c. and also the threats of Meshed; and might rule with something of his old vigour, and recover the popularity which he is fast losing. 6 . Sartip Mir Masum Khan is going up to Birjand in two months* time to marry his first cousin, the daughter of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk.3 7. Russian goods, principally rice, sugar, oil, and prints, are still pouring into Seistan from Meshed. The British merchants having now replenished their stocks of rice and sugar, the Russians have, as was to be expected, lowered their prices. The British merchants state that their trade has not yet been injured by this competition; but they are nervous about the future. The Russians are getting a large number of the principal men into their debt, by advancing them cloth, &amp;c., on credit. They then exact a promise from them not to deal with the British shops, and so keep them in perpetual bondage. British traders, having to consider their profits, cannot make these reckless advances, and so will probably lose ground. The aim of the Russian traders is openly political, i.e., to be able to show equal material interests to those of the British in Seistan, and thus dispose of all idea of a British right of pre-emption over that country. Consequently the greater the number of the people of the country whom they can get into their debt, whether the debts are bad or good, the better will they be pleased. Unless the Imperial Bank of Persia can relax its rigid banking rules with regard to its branch which is shortly to be established here, I do not think it will be able to make much headway against the Russian methods.

EEPOKT ON BECONNAISSANCES MADE WHILE ATTACHED TO THE SEISTAN ARBITRATION COMMISSION. INTRODUCTION. Towards the end of December 1902 I received telegraphic orders to join the Seistan Mission which was shortly to start from Quetta for Seistan, travel- ling by way of Nushki and the Uelmand. My duties were to make a railway reconnaissance of the route traversed by the expedition. Our line of march lay through Southern Afghanistan, and the opportunity of obtaining some knowledge of the country from a Railway Engineer’s point of view was regarded as highly valuable. My stall consisted of two native surveyors. I reached Quetta in time to start with the Mission on the 10th January, thanks to Colonel McMahon who engaged my transport beforehand, and to Mr. Woodside, Executive Engineer, Quetta-Nushki Railway, who supplied me with tents and instruments. I accompanied the party as far as Bund-i- Seistan, where the head works of the main, canal are situated on the Perso- Afo-han frontier, about 35 miles from the capital, Nasratabad. The total length of this reconnaissance was 338 miles, 213 from ^Nushki to the Helmand and 125 down the valley to Bund-i-Seistan. There the Mission halted to commence arbitration proceedings; and as the country beyond was flat and featureless, both the British Commissioner and I were of opinion that mv services as Railw ay Intelligence Officer with the party were no longer required. It was, therefore, agreed that I should return by an alternative route, and investigate the alignment of a railway which should lie wholly in British territory from the Persian frontier at Robat to Nushki. The general direction of this reconnaissance coincides with what is generally known as the Seistan trade route; its length is about 360 miles from our frontier post at Robat, or 344 miles from the Afghan frontier at the point where I crossed it, Maki Nawar, near Ziarat Shah-i-Mardan. The advantages of a railway along this route were, in Colonel McMahon s opinion, two-fold ; in that, lying within our own border, it could be put m hand at any time, and that, being a flanking line to an invader from Seistan or the Helmand, it is strategically preferable to the direct line down the valley. The weakness of an unsupported line of such length in proximity through out to a possibly hostile frontier is, however, apparent. Its liability to attack at various points on its length would, if Afghanistan were unfriendly, hamper operations in force at its western extremity, if it did not make them quite too hazardous to attempt. It therefore, seemed desirable, for the sake of the completeness ot the scheme 5 that a reconnaissance should be made for a railway from some suitable function on the trade route to a port on the coast; with the double object ot stiffening the Nushki-Seistan Railway, by providing a second line of advance and retreat, and of preventing its being outflanked., and left in the air, by an invading force advancing through Southern Baluchistan.

I accordingly investigated routes to both places. The length of these reconnaissances in Southern Baluchistan was 730 miles. They were unavoidably carried out in almost the hottest time of the year, between the 10th April and the 14th June, when it is barely possible to do such work as exhaustively as in the usual working season. But the necessity for a railway from the coast to Seistan has been so frequently dwelt upon by military writers (as if the feasibility of the scheme was not a matter for doubt), that itseemed undesirable to lose the opportunity, that my being in ^ ^ staff and transport offered, of placing the practicability or impia the route beyond all question.

Nushki-Robat Nushki-Afghan Frontier Nushki-Bund-i-Kamal Khan (on Helmand) 360 miles. 344 „ 406 „ Unlike the reconnaissance of the Helmand route, this was a genuine investigation of the most suitable alignment for a railway between Nushki and the places noted above; and the plan and section submitted may be regarded as indicating the eventual location of the line within the usual narrow limits. Some easy bank and cutting Note. - On maps Ekmach and Yakmach, same word. It is the The main features of the alignment from an engineering point of view are easily explained. For the first third of its length, until within a few miles of Dalbandin, the line runs along the northern glacis of the Sheikh Hussain, Has Koh, and Kambaran range. Near Dalbandin it crosses a narrow belt of sandhills and attains the southern glacis of the Chageb, Koh-i-Sultan, and neighbouring mountains, along which its middle third lies. The remaining third from Ware Sahib Chah to Kobat is on the northern glacis of the Saindak, Kacha Koh, and Kobat range. The general direction of the line varies from south-west at Nushki to north-west at Robat, and is in the form of a crescent concave towards the north. From end to end of its 360 miles of length a cheap line could be built without any works whatever, except a short low bridge or two at Baghak below Nushki. Elsewhere “ Dips ” could be made at all nulla crossings with a minimum of cutting, and the preliminary dressing of the formation would be of the lightest description. will be required through the sand belt at Dalbandin; and, beyond Ekmach, my alignment should, perhaps, be kept a little more to the south, so as to reach the point where the watercourses finally merge in the plain, or, at any rate, become mere shallow wide depressions. This portion of the reconnaissance from Ekmach to Trato was made on days of continuous duststorms, when, though I followed a compass bearing, it was impossible to fix my position on the map at any intermediate point. The line on the plan, therefore, may not quite coincide with the correct route, and may be drawn rather further to the north than intended. I mention the matter as the difference of a mile or two on a talus is sufficient to make all the differ ence between a surface line, with “ Dips” only, and one with considerable bridging. A few curves will be necessary between Mushki Chah and Ware Sahib Chah to avoid some isolated rocky mounds, but minute details of this descrip tion need scarcely be dwelt on in a reconnaissance report. Suffice it to say that it would be difficult anywhere in India to find an equal length of line either cheaper to construct or less easy to damage. Unlinking the rails and sleepers, and making bonfires of the latter, is the only way in which traffic could be interrupted. For this reason it would, perhaps, be desirable to use steel sleepers throughout. The shingle and grit of these glacis is just the road bed that suits them, while the short stretches of earthy plain and marsh could be thoroughly well ballasted. Another advantage of the steel sleeper over the wooden in a line of this description is that it has no tendency to float when a rush of water crosses a “ Dip.” In locating the alignment the engineer’s aim should be to keep as far as possible on the lower edge of the glacis, where the shingle makes a natural I : s2 ballast, and the nullas cease to have defined channels. ^ below ground level, are seldom damaged by the heaviest flood; but, w nere experience shows that bridges are required, such works can subsequently be added without inconvenience, and the line gradually brought up to first class standard. A section on the scale of 4 miles=l ,/ horizontal, and 400 feet —1 vertical, is submitted; but for the purposes of this report the rough le^ els given on the plan will probably be found sufficient. In some respects, too, a section on so small a scale may give a misleading impression of the roughness of the country, near Kirtaka and Saindak, where tbe ups and downs are really the rolling surface of the glacis. The section, however, gives full details of the character of the country traversed by the alignment. It was taken with a barometer, distances being measured by a cyclometer borrowed from the officer of the Survey of India with the Seistan Mission. Tor work of this sort I know of nothing to equal it. Headings can be taken to two places of deci mals of a mile, and a man can wheel it all day at three miles per hour. It will be noted from the plan that three alternative routes are shown through the sandhills near Dalbandin— (a) One, which is that along which the section was taken, turns sharp to the south and zig-zags through them via the Kanian nulla and Alum Khan Chah; thus attaining tbe Kambaran glacis as quickly as possible, and crossing the sand belt by wbat I believe is the shortest route. (0 The midmost route is along tbe caravan road, and may, on the whole, be neglected; for, though tbe sands are far from formidable, and tbe alignment shorter than (a), while a good supply of water is found in the nawars or basins among the sandhills ; still these advantages are discounted by the long slant with which the alignment crosses the belt. The twenty miles of alternate sand hill and basin would be more difficult to maintain, and very little cheaper to build, than tbe longer line, which has only 5 miles of very insignificant sandhills. The third alternative, however, deserves attention when the survey of the line is undertaken. My information led me to believe that tbe belt of sand extended without a break from the Mash- khel Hamun to Nushki; whereas, when I reached tiie Laghar Koh, I observed what appeared to be a wide gap in it, givin^ a clear passage to tbe north in the direction of Dalbandin. The local levy sowars informed me that there was an unobstructed road from Laghar Koh and Mull, between the sand and a low range of hills to the north, via Ushke Nali to Dalbandin; but that much of it was over salt marsh which was flooded in wet weather, and always bad going, while recent rains had filled up the wells. 1 I would recommend that the survey officer, after starting operations at Nushki, should march along route {g) to Dalbandin, and thence return by the northern one through the salt marsh. Where two alignments are so easy it is difficult sometimes to arrive at a decision. Probably («) is the better ^ all things considered, but both should be ridden over' before either is finally adopted. c ^ I was quite satisfied with the alignments obtained, {a) and (b), and thought further investigation vould lead to unnecessary delay, as my transport animals were all done up, and could barely reach Nushki. I tried some short cuts near Mushki Chah and the Koh-i-Dalil, hut they proved unsatisfactory Future survey officers may note that it is no use attempting anythin of the sort there. o j D Near Kobat the plan shows two lines; one, dotted, along the glacis towards the Persian frontier, and requiring no further notice; and a full line (alone which I marched), entering Afghan territory, and crossing the heavy sand belt on each side of the Shelag Diver by a circuitous route. Thence it runs acrossa **put” for a few miles till it reaches the low scarp of the Tarakhun Desert; Pushkiniki, where the bluff changes to a gentle slope, will be found a suitable place for the ascent. But other places, such as Irkuft, where the main caravan road is, will likely prove equally easy. Prom Pushkiniki a line can be taken to Bund-i-Kamal Khan on the Helmand, involving a minimum of bank and cutting, though not actually a surface line. My object in investigating this alignment was that, if our system ever reaches Robat, the Amir of Afghanistan might not object to a branch to Kamal Khan or Bund-i-Seistan, through this outlying corner of his dominions. Without a railway in this direction, a force, operating from Robat towards the Helmand, would be greatly hampered by the waterless tract of the Tarakhun Desert, for, from the Shelag River, where excavations in its sandy bed give an ample supply of rather abominable water, the country is waterless to the Helmand, a distance of more than 40 miles. A short watercourse ending at Killa Afzal need not be considered, as it would certainly be blocked in time of war. The only engineering difficulty is a very heavy belt of sand on each side of the Shelag. This consists in places of moving sandhills, or “Barkans”, travelling over fixed sandhills, whose surface has a thin covering of black grit or coarse sand, hence their name Siah Reg. This species of double sandhill from a mainten ance point of view is the most objectionable thing of the sort I have ever met with. It is possible that the Siah Reg may prove fairly firm underneath. I noticed a few ancient domes and graveyards on them, which one does not meet as a rule on pure sandhills. A feasible alignment through this belt will be found along the route suggested on the plan. The trouble will rather be in maintenance than construction, owing to the westerly gales that prevail all through the hot weather. The Shelag is the lowest point on the route to Seistan, being only 1,500 feet above sea level. Once the sand belt is crossed, there are no further difficulties; the Pushkiniki ascent is quite easy, and the Tarakhun Desert (a waste of gravel overlying clay) is just rough enough to require a little bank and cutting here and there. Gradient. —Three-fourths of the alignment lie between the 2,800 feet and the 3,300 feet contour. At Ekmach it descends to 2,500 feet or 2,600 feet, but only for a few miles; at Ware Sahib Chah the higher limit is topped for a short distance. Easy grades are obtainable for more than 300 miles of the 360, though whether the ruling gradient will be nearer 1—150 than 1—200 is a point that can only be decided by more detailed survey. A barometric section is scarcely reliable for flatter gradients than 1—80, more especially when taken, as this one was, in very unsettled weather. The steepest gradients will occur (1) in descending the Nushki glacis to &gt;T , j , ^ v ,,. Baghak, a distance of 9 miles, where I a year ago I pointed out that, if Xushki is made an nOW liope that 1 100 Will be found engine-changing station, a banking engiue will be possible; and (2) in the descent from below Saindak to the Afghan frontier. wanted at Baghak. If the main line be taken to Robat, it may be desirable to save length, and use 1—80, or steeper, on the branch towards Bund-i-Kamal Khan, instead of descending the glacis gradually as the line shown on the plan does. Curvature .—Except among the sandhills previously mentioned, where sharp curves will be necessary, the curvature will be the same as in ordinary plain country. Water-supply .—In one respect the trade route alignment compares unfavourably with the direct line via the Helmand, namely, in the matter of water-supply. Judging from the existing wells at the Thanas on the road, a sufficient supply for a light traffic will probably be obtained for the first 150 miles from INushki, say, as far as Ekmach, where there appears to be a good underground flow; and possibly for some 10 miles further, where I noticed some likely looking nulla-beds under the Nuhli Koh. But with the exception of ISushki, Baghak, the sandhill tracts, and Ekmach, even on this portion of the line water will be none too plenty. Dplbandin depends upon a karez so small4 that it dries up every afternoon; yet this is the only running water crossed by the line between Baghak and the Helmand. The wells at the post houses yield enough for the supply of ordinary caravans, hut it is doubtful if many of them would stand the strain of railway requirements. We no longer find the shallow free-flowing water holes of the northern route, while there is no reason to suppose that artesian bores would he successful. Beyond Ekmach the outlook is much worse. The caravan road, it will he noted, wanders about from spring to spring among the hills, in country quite unsuited for a railway; while the latter is on open glacis or dasht where water is rarely found, except at great depths and in small quantities. In dry weather the springs among the mountains are little better than “ Soaks”; still some thing may be possible in the way of improving and then piping them. We may trust also to an increased knowledge of the country leading to the discovery of unknown or unused sources; but the prominent fact at present is that the whole tract on either side of the alignment is more desolate and water less than any part of British Baluchistan that I am familiar with. Long pipe line's, too, are open to grave objection on a military railway, since any band of local outlaws or raiders can easily shatter a pipe carrying the supply to an important changing station, and paralyse the traffic of the line. We should, therefore, be prepared to have to work the traffic over long distances with the help of tank wagons and water trains, as is now done, to some extent, between Jacobabad and Sibi. The flatness of the gradients render this course less objectionable than it would be on a ghat line. Tanks could be constructed at all stations and fed from wells or water trains for the use of troops in time of war, while in ordinary times the staff would get their drinking water as best they could, from well, spring, or pipe line. The quality of the water is generally bad. Traffic. Prospects .—Under existing conditions in Seistan, where a rising trade has been suddenly stifled by hostile tariffs, it is difficult to see what traffic prospects the railway possesses, beyond those men tioned in the Helmand route report. Note .—Our new commercial treaty with Persia, which I saw mentioned in the papers the other day, may mend matters ; hut treaty agreements can he burked by local officials, and the export of grain from Seistan put under an embargo. Until a more enlightened and progressive Government is establish ed in Seistan, the grain exporting potentialities of the country will never be fully developed. A certain amount of trade still goes on across the border, but it is in camel loads, not wagon-loads, and there seemed to be a good deal of smuggling con nected with it. Some dates, ghi, and wool would come in from Talk and Panjomr; wheat from the Afghan Helmand might be expected in fair quantities; but all export from the real granary, Seistan, might be prohibited. . °wn territory is so destitute of inhabitants that the local traffic would he infinitesimal from a railway-man’s standpoint. The country, however, according to Mr. Vredenburg’s report, possesses some mineral resources. r \ Sulphur and earth dyes in the Koh-i-Sultan, a thin seam of lead near See Appendix. Saindak, copper in Has Uoh, and the remains of old copper workings near ilobat. lime alone would show whether they were commercially worth anv- thing, but from Mr. Vredenburg’s report they scarcely appear promising In short, the railwcy (independently of possible extensions westward) has no claim to be regarded as other than a purely political and strategic line, commanding Seistan and the route from Nasratabad to the Persian Gulf. Judged from this aspect, it has several advantages over the Helmand route viz &amp; it is not only within onr own territory, but it offers at the same time— ’ {a) Better gradients. (b) Greater freedom from sand. (c) Less liability to interruption in time of war, as it is a surface line and also protected all along its Afghan front by the Begistanl the Chageh, and Koh-i-Sultan ranges, and the wide sand belt south of the Gaud-i-Zirreh.Its vulnerable points are south of Chageh; at Ekmach, where a track crosses the mountains from Arbu; at Mushki Chah, near which place a caravan road leads to Rudbar; and the portion nearest Robat. With the assistance of a branch to Bund-i-Kamal Khan a small force could operate very effectively against an army advancing up the Helmand. ^ Stations .—It would be premature to make any suggestions regarding stations. . Probably there will be two watering stations; Dalbandin, a small civil station, and the only bazar on the line; and Kondi, where the junction with the railway to the coast would be. Neither is very suitable, as the water-supply of both is deficient in quan tity and bad in quality. By purchasing the Dalbandin karez, and piping the water, enough would be obtained for ordinary requirements. The wells at the Kondi Tkana are slightly brackish and not very free-flowing. Ekmach and the sandhill tract, where I believe the supply would be adequate, are badly situated for changing stations. Materials —Are non-existent except ballast and sand. The latter is not always obtainable. Bricks could be burnt with coal dust near Baghak. Estimates .—Taking Bund-i-Seistan as our objective, purely for the pur poses of comparison, it will be seen from the report on the Helmand route that the cost of this line is rather less than that of the shorter route via the Helmand, but the difference is inappreciable.

Programme for Survey and Construction .—Arrangements would entirely depend upon whether the work had to be pushed or not. Under ordinary condi tions, two strong survey parties could stake out the line to the Persian or Afghan frontier in a full working season. One should start at Nushki and the other at Ekmach. They should be well equipped with transport and pakhals. If the work were urgent, and construction had to be commenced without * Two would be sufficient if a route free from sand delay, three SUrVCV parties* WOUld be is obtained north of the sandhills. required. One at Nushki; one at Mull, some thirty miles further on; and the third at the sandhills near Dalbandin. Parties 1 and 2, as they finished their lengths, could either go on construction, or take up new positions ahead, according to the rate plate-laying was progress ing, and the start that party No. 3 had of railhead. Plate-laying could be begun within a month of the first party’s taking the field. The time occupied in completing the line to the frontier will entirely depend upon the promptness with which permanent-way materials come to hand, and upon the rate of plate-laying. With adequate arrangements Robat could be reached in less than two years, a very moderate estimate. In making this reconnaissance I was greatly assisted by information kindly given me by Colonel McMahon, Mr. Tate of the Survey of India, and Captain Webb Ware.6 p ^ Thanks to their hints as to route, I was able to hit off the correct alignment from the outset, and accomplished the distance at an average rate of 20 miles per diem. W. A. Johns, Deputy Consulting Engineer for Railways, Bombay.Appendix. Colonel McMahon, whose knowledge of the country is unrivalled, takes a favourable view of its mineral resources. I have just received a letter from him on the subject, parts of which are printed as an Appendix. W. A. J. “ Your query about mineral resources is a difficult one. My own personal belief is that a railway to Seistan would result in a large production of minerals. The country has never been properly prospected, and, until a railway comes, it never will be, because what pays to work near a railway is useless to touch without a line. We know of old copper workings at Itobat, and we know of copper in the Has Koh hills. We know of lead near Saindak, and there are large quantities of sulphur and earth dyes in the Koh-i-Sultan. The iron we found in the sand, and which we roughly estimated at of the sand, has been carefully analysed at Calcutta, and proves to be good iron, i.e., 65% of pure iron oxide. A day may come when some simple and cheap form of utilising the wind to work electro magnets to catch the iron out of the wind-driven sand, will make it worth while to work that iron and add to the railway exports’*. The following remarks on the Seistan traffic, and the best route for the extension beyond, are contained in the same letter :— “ The more we see of Seistan, and the more we work out the available areas of irrigable land and volume of available water, the more astonishing do the future possible prospects of Seistan appear. I believe, under any circum stances, whether the Seistan canal systems were reorganised or not, that a railway would lead to an enormous grain export, not to mention export of wool and hides in which there are large openings. You will doubtles say that sanguine expect ations do not suffice to establish in figures a paying return on this or any other line. I admit this, and realise that it is practically impossible to show that the Note. —I share this belief to some extent, hnt it requires something more than belief to warrant one in recommending a line as a commercial undertaking. It can be easily demonstrated by figures that, if the cultivated area of Seistan were doubled, and the export of grain encouraged by the Persian Govern ment, a railway would pay working expenses, and 1 % or 2% on its capital cost. If the area were trebled, it would be a paying scheme. But these are hypotheses quite outside our control, and other things besides canals would want reorganisation first. W. A. J. line will be a paying line for some time, but I adhere to my belief that the time before the line does begin to pay will not be long. However, as the line, to begin with, would be built for purely strategic and political objects, its commercial aspect is not so important as it might be. * * * “ I see no advantage in aiming at Nasratabad. It is a vile hole in every sense. A name, nothing else, except, perhaps, a smell. I would advocate sticking to open ground, and cutting across the southern portion of Seistan, by Sekhowa and Yarmab, and getting across the Hamun by a long embankment. It all depends, of course, how your line approaches the country. “ If by Bund-i-Kamal Khan, from the east, it might proceed as above, or via Tarakhun to Houzdar, &amp;c., and then either northwards further into Seistan, or straight across the Hamun. The Hamun is much about the same anywhere* so far as obstacle goes, and so it does not seem to matter much where you cross it. Seistan itself outside the canal area is easy everywhere. “If you approach Seistan from south of the Shelag, then the Shelag presents a difficult obstacle,* and it be comes a question whether it is not better to avoid it, and work round the end of the Haraun, and miss Seistan altogether. I myself would advocate taking a line from Bund-i-Kamal Khan on left bank, and bending off in a curve south of the Rud- i-Seistan, and across by the Hamun. This would territory, and work through * i.e., the sandhills already referred to. W. A. J. Note. —It seems to me that, for an extension west of the Hamun, the simplest arrangement would be to round the south of the Hamun, and deal with Seistan by a branch via Bund-i-Kamal Khan (as shown on the plan) which could penetrate the richest parts of the country; for canal bridges, however numerous, are trifling things for a railway. A 12 feet bank, 20 miles long, tipped from both ends, and pitched all along for a protection against waves, would be very expensive. W. A.

Diary of Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.L, C.I.E., British Com missioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 16th December 1903. Qth December 1903, Camp Milok. —No news of importance. 10^ December t Camp Milok. —This Mission left Quetta 11 months ago to-day. During the past two days visits have been paid on Colonel Minchin and Captain Winter by the Karguzar and Yamin-i-Nizam, and these visits have been duly returned. To-day the Akhundzada came, at my request, from Kila- i-Kang, and paid me a visit, with Musa Khan of Herat and others, at which Colonel Minchin and Captain Winter were present. Besides making the acquaintance of these Persian and Afghan officials, these visits have given Colonel Minchin and Captain Winter an opportunity, in a private capacity, of learning the formalities and etiquette which the custom of this country demands on such occasions. The Akhundzada had no news to give, and no reply has yet arrived from Kabul to his letter forwarding my award. He is now daily expecting a letter. YUh December, Camp Milok. —Colonel Minchin and Captains Winter and Watson left us to-day for Nasratabad, en route to Meshed. The British officers of the Mission rode with them as far as Zahidan, where we gave them a farewell breakfast in the ruins of that wonderful old city. It was destroyed by Timur Lang, who derived his epithet of Lang, “ the lame ”, from a wound received in Seistan. In revenge for his wound he massacred the whole population. Even now the ruins are one mass of broken human bones covering a large area. We had made several unsuccessful previous attempts to find complete skulls, but to-day were lucky enough to find two well preserved specimens which are being sent to England. After bidding farewell to Colonel Minchin and his party, I rode to visit the Mil-i-Kasimabad, some miles to the north of Zahidan. The Mil is one of the most interesting relics of past times that we have found in Seistan. It is a tall, circular, and very graceful masonry pillar, with a broad inscription in Cufic characters round the top, or rather what is now the top. It looks as though the pillar had once been higher, with probably a projecting gallery round the top and another inscription above the present one. The present top is 76 feet above the ground. The pillar is beautifully built of small square burnt bricks, and has a spiral staircase, now unusable, up the inside of it. Attempts have evidently been made in past times, but with little success, to destroy it, for the inscription has evidently been well battered with missiles and a large breach made, some way up, in its side. What brute violence has failed to do in the past is now being rapidly effected by the Seistanis of to-day, who have dangerously undermined the base, in order to extract bricks for their miserable huts. The Mil is worth careful preservation, and I propose to obtain the Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s consent to my repairing the base, and thus ensuring the safety of this interesting old landmark of the past. To expect a Persian, not withstanding his knowledge of, and pride in, ancient Persian legends, especially those of Seistan, to put out a finger to preserve his ancient ruins is hopeless. Only to-day I saw a Persian digging away at the base of the wall of the old citadel of Zahidan, extracting great, big square bricks for some wretched shanty or other. Vlth December, Camp Milok. —Some short while ago I despatched a well- equipped party accompanied by Afghans to the Dasht-i-Margo to search for the bodies of our poor Surveyor Khan Bahadur Sheikh Mohi-ud-din and his men, who died last June, and bring them in for proper burial. I was led to believe that the bodies would be found intact, because one of our Ghilzai camel Jemadars went off without my knowledge some two months ago to look for the body of2 Ins son Abdulla Jan. He failed to find it, but found and brought m the body of the’ mher lost Ghilzai camel-man, Khudadad, Miam. I he body was untouched by birds or animals, and, curious to relate, had been dned into a marvellous state of preservation by the fierce dry heat of the de *® rt . P T y . returned yesterday. They found all the bodies except that of Abdulla Jan, and brought them to the Ziarat of Amiran, where they were properly interred. 13« t December, Camp Milok.-I'ae Yamin-i-Nizam has received a tele- o-ram from Tehran in reply to references made by him and the Karguzar, informing him that he is now sole Persian Commissioner. This is a great triumph for him over the Karguzar, who will now doubtless endeavour to pick all the holes he can in his whilom colleague’s management of affairs and general character. Owing to the dense tamarisk jungle all round our camp, we have had repeated attempts made night after night by thieves on our camp, bo rar they have failed to score, while we have managed to capture two of them. 14//i December, Camp Milok. —We marched to-day to Deh Dost Muham mad. The whole country of Miankangi is dense jungle, and a road had to be cut for our march. I did the march nearly into Deh Dost Muhammad by boat, in order to inspect the Nad Ali branch of the Helmand and various canals. The Nad Ali channel up to above Burj-i-As, where it divides into several large canals, is even at this time of year a largish river. It is about the size and volume of the Thames at Richmond. Bv taking the river route I find I missed a curious incident which occurred on the land route at Pukak. A large triumphal arch was found erected at that village over the road, and the road gaily decorated with flags and coloured cloths. This was the work of one Abdul Latif, a Peshawari trader settled in Pukak. With the aid of Mr. Dobbs he recently won a case against the Customs Department and feels elated thereat. When we first came to Pukak last March, he hardly dared to recognise us. The Yamin, who passed through the Arch to-day, must have thought times had changed. Sir Pred. Goldsmid in 1872 w^as not allowed to enter this or other neighbouring villages. \Uh December, Camp Deh Dost Muhammad. —The incoming dak sowar was attacked by thieves last night between Milok and Pukak. His dak bag luckily w T as not taken, but he lost his horse and boots. Miankangi is full of thieves. The Hashmat-ubMulk and the Akhundzada have suppressed all their own gangs, but there are still a large number of private and independent freebooters at large. The dense jungle on the border of the two countries is a safe refuge for outlaws from both sides. I have warned the Yamin-i-Nizam that, if we have any more trouble from thieves, we may have to take unpleasant steps. I have asked Captain Ramsay to warn the Hashmat-ul-Mulk in a similar sense. I have asked the Yamin to send two sowars with our dak men. 16/&amp; December, Camp Deh Dost Muhammad. —I received a letter from Mr. Moore, dated Gurg, 8th December. He reports that he has been successful in finding an ample supply of water at various places in the 35 miles betw een Nasratabad-lspe and Gurg, and at Gurg itself. This is very satisfac tory. Some men I sent to Parrah returned to-day, and report that two regi ments and six guns are on their w ? ay to Herat from Kandahar, but no reinforce ments have come to Parrah (vide diary entry of 25th November 1903). They say there are rumours in Parrah of recent fighting between General Ghaus-ud-din Khan and Russians, in winch many have been killed on both sides. These rumours are so persistent that the Parrah people are inclined to believe them. The Yamin-i-Nizam came and paid me a long friendly visit this afternoon. He has followed with great interest the accounts given in the “Pioneer” (which I send him every day to read) of His Excellency the Viceroy’s tour in the Persian Gulf, and especially the speeches made at various places. He seems very gratified by the references made therein to Persia. He understands the Persian Gulf question w r ell, as he has served in many parts of the Gulf, and at one time w as appointed Governor of the Gulf Ports, but did not take up the appointment. He expressed great indignation and regret at the hitch which prevented His Exc3llency the Viceroy landing at Bushire, and severely criticised3 the selection of the Ala-ud-Dowleh as the Persian representative sent to meet His Excellency, saying he had lived all his life in the narrow circle of the Persian Court, and had no experience whatever of dealing with foreigners.

The Passport Mirza in Deh Dost Muhammad is demanding passports from the Afghans who come to our camp. A fee of 15 krans has to be paid for each passport. The Akhundzada is very annoyed at this, and I hear he has seized two men of the Karai Regi ment found on the Afghan side, and kept them in cnstoly in retaliation. It is, of course, objectionable that any hindrance should be put in the way of Afghans coming to and from this camp, as messages are interchanged between the Akhundzada and this camp many times a day. I find, on enquiry from the Yamin-i-Nizam, that the Passport officer of Seistan is working independently of the Seistan authorities, and is not under the Governor or Karguzar, or even the Customs officer. I sent a message to the Yamin, through Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, that I protest against passport restrictions being applied to any one, Afghan or otherwise, connected with this Mission, and that the Passport Mirza should be instructed accordingly. The Yamin replied that he would telegraph to Meshed, asking that the passport system be held in abeyance on this border while the Mission is here, and, in the meantime, he had asked the Mirza to let Afghans alone. A few days ago the head Passport officer informed Sharbat Khan, my Sarishtedar in the city, that he had not intended to commence passport opera tions in Seistan till after the Id, but that Dr. Miller and Mons. d’Hoedt had urged him to start work at once. As far as I can see, the passport system has been instituted in Seistan at the instigation of the Russians at either Tehran or Meshed, with the object of causing annoyance and irritation on the Afghan border, and especially in order to hamper the growing trade between Afghans and our British and Indian traders in Seistan. It will be found very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to enforce the system, because Afghan and Persian Seistan are practically homogeneous. The cultivators on both sides belong to the same tribes. A family has some of its members in Afghan and others in Persian Seistan. No system of passports will prevent these people from going backwards and forwards over the frontier, and any serious attempt to demand passports and payment from them will lead to trouble. 18th December, Deh Dost Muhammad. —No news of importance. 19th December. —I started to-day on a long contemplated trip to visit the country east of Kila Kang and south of Chakansur, which is one mass of old ruins that run in one continuous line northwards, for over 50 miles, from Sar-o- Tar. The Akhundzada has always expressed willingness to let us go there, but the opportunity of going has not occurred before. Major Walters and Messrs. Ward, Tate, and Landon accompanied me. Taking only a light camp with us, we w T ent to-day about 21 miles through a splendidly rich, well-watered country to Menu, wdiich is the nearest point to the ruins where water is obtainable. The whole march was through either rich fields or tracts of jungle and luxuriant grass. 20th December. —Starting early, we spent a long day riding over a wide flat even plain of pat stretching eastwards to the Dasht-i-Margo. In whichever direction one looked, and as far as the eye could see, were series and series of massive old ruins. These were all in the form of high walled forts or towers, some square, and others circular. Like other ruins in Seistan, these buildings are composed of thick massive walls of mud brick, standing on foundations and walls, to a height of 3 or 4 feet above the ground, of burnt brick and cement. Many of the buildings are in an excellent state of preservation, but evidently of great age. A series of large ancient canals and smaller irrigation channels can be easily traced over the plain. The pakka masonry outlets for water from these canals, and the remains of old masonry syphons, mark a very2 advanced stage of irrigation science We visited ^ STio^SoS ^’h^To^—n nitd their original ss«iv - ^•twrsssaraf $s citis-^ss ft^s’^crji’rs toners in the perimeter of this place.) Divvalak (little nails) and so on. The number and extent of the ruins, the architectural skill shown in heir me num oer ., f a pjgp sca i e 0 f wealth and luxury which the ground ’plans of the houses, and the size and height of some of the rooms afford, bear silent and sad witness to a past prosperous, populous, and civilised country, now hut seldom visited by man, where the silence of desolation reigns supreme. . Unlike the ruins to the south-west of this tract, now buried in whole or in part, by slowly advancing waves of sand, the tract we were in to-day is totally free of sand. _ . . At the Amiran Ziarat. we visited the graves of poor Khan Bahadur Sheikh Mohi-ud-din Khan and his survey khalassis. They now repose in very sacred ground, for the Ziarat of Amiran, who is locally reputed to have been a first cousin of the Prophet, is much venerated by the people of Afghan Seistan, who make annual pilgrimages there. 'Wa rpf nrnpfl to Menu late in the -Pf n Inrwr omrl ing day’s ride. As far as I can ascertain, no Europeans, not even the ubiquitous Conolly, Perrier, or Christie, have ever before visited the tract we explored to-day. It is but little known, even to the people of this country. 21st December—1 returned to the main camp at Deh Dost Muhammad. To-day is the Id, and was observed with all due ceremony and festivity in camp. On this one day of the year even the Seistanis don clean clothing and try to forget the cares of a Seistan life. I called on the Yamin-i-Nizam in the evening to pay him the compliments of the day. I found him very friendly and cordial. 22nd December, Deh Dost Muhammad Khan of Herat, who was sent here nearly two years ago to settle boundary disputes with the Persians, and has acted hitherto as Assistant Afghan Commissioner, has made a bolt of it and returned to Herat. The real reason for this is a natural desire to return home, especially as the recent death of his brother has left some questions of estate to be settled. The Akhundzada was afraid, on his own responsibility, to give him leave to go back to Herat, even for a time. Musa Khan is also dis satisfied with the allowance given to him, while on deputation, from the Chakansur revenues, by the Akhundzada. Like an Afghan, he will try to excuse his conduct by saying he was displeased with the Akhundzada’s treatment of boundary questions and his extreme friendliness to us. I am very thankful now that I managed to get Musa Khan’s signature to the letter to the Amir, forwarding my award and recommending its acceptance. The Akhundzada is taking his departure philosophically, and is mighty glad at heart to get rid of him. 23rd December, Deh Dost Muhammad. —I forget to mention, in my diary entry of the 20th instant, that careful ground plans of the more important ruins, not only round Amiran, but in other parts of Seistan, have been made by us. These may, hereafter, throw light on the comparative age of the various different series of Seistan ruins. 24^ December, Deh Dost Muhammad. —The Akhundzada still has received no reply from Kabul about my award. He has, I hear, written several times urging the Amir to intimate his acceptance of .it without delay. The Persian Commissioner, on the other hand, is constantly begging me to commence demarcation as soon as possible. The anxiety shown, on both sides, to commence and complete demarcation work, is a fairly accurate indication that the boundary line pleases them both. Captain Bamsay, with Messrs. Emmerson and MacMurray, Cooper and Greensill have come out to camp from the city, to-day, to spend Xmas with us.3 No. 1351 , dated Deh Dost Muhammad, the 26 th December 1903 .

WHE attached notes on Seistan are intended to supplement tl;&lt;£ -L information already contained in the proof of the “ Mili tary Eeport on Seistan,” and in certain casas to correct informa tion, which appears to be out of date. Owing to the flatness of the country and the soft nature of the soil, the Hahnand from time to time cuts new channels for itself, and converts what was originally the bed of a canal into a branch of the river. The result is that towns and villages and iormerly cultivated areas are deserted; the inhabitants move to a new place and found new villages in the vicinity of the newly cultivated area. This has made it somewhat difficult to collate the previous information supplied from various sources, and I have there* fore tried to furnish, as accurately as is possible in a country where the political situation is such as it is at the present time in Seistan, a complete list of all the villages, cultivation, and resources of the province. In order to do this I travesed Seistan in every direction during more than three months, and have personally seen every village and locality mentioned in these notes. E. A. PLUNKETT, Captain, - 1st Battalion, Lincoln Begiment. Simla ; The 30th June 1903.NOTES ON PERSIAN SEISTAN. CHAPTER I. GEOGRAPHY. GENERAL DESCRIPTION, The cultivated area of Persian Seistan which is bounded on the north by Takht-i-Shab, on the east by the old bed of the Halmand, running northwards from the Band-i-Seistan, on the west by the Hamun-i-Halmand (usually called the Naizar by the Seistanis) and of which the village of Varmal is the southermost limit, is divided into five districts, namely [a) Miankangi, or “ low ground between ”, i t e., between the two branches of the Halmand ; (4) Pusht-i-Ab, or “Northern water (c) Sheb-i-Ab, signifying “ Southern water and (&lt;2) the Mahal-i-Sharaki ; and (*) Mabal-i-Nahrui, or districts named after the tribes exercising the greatest influence in the locality. The two latter, which are contiguous, are often treated as one district, making the total number four only. Although these divisions are not at the present time administrative units ^n any way, the names are always made use of by the inhabitants in speaking of the country and they present still spheres of influence of various tribes and their headmen. ® 1 ° r instance, the Miankangi district is peopled chiefly by Baluchih v xt Jemalzai, Saruni, and other Taoki tribes, while it is said tha4 the Nahrui district has in great part been restored to Sardar Said Khan, the present Chief of the Nahruis, who has just been allowed to return to Seistan . Moreover, Sardar Purdil Khan, the Sarbandi Chief, exercises great influence in Sbeb-i-Ab, where many of his tribesmen live, and rumour states that he has P ai( ^ a lamp sum to the f£ Hashmat-ul-Mu!k” for the produce this vear for the whole of this district. It is advisable therefore that these five main divi sions of Seistan should not be lost sight of. Commencing from the north they are situated as follows : Which comprises all the land north of the Band-i-Parian, Miankangi contained between the two branches of the , ’ Halmand river which there separate, namely, 0 old Halmand and the Rud-i-Parian. This district was until recent years sko]ect to severe flools, to which the dense tamarisk jungle which here abouTids ars witness, and the greater part of the cultivation found in clearings among the tamarisk, is of comparatively recent growth.

This district comprises by far the richest part of the culti vation of Seistan, and is situated in the sheon-Ab. extreme south-west of the inhabited area, being bounded by a line drawn from the Koh-i-Kwaja through Yarmal, Sehkoha, Sharak, Bahramabad, Bagbak, and thence north-east to the Naizar. A list of villages in these five main divisions is attached. Mahal-i-Bhfiraki.14- notes ON PERSIAN SEISTAN. THE CANAL SYSTEM OF SEISTAN.

The water of the old Halmand or the eastern branch of that river, which at present constitutes the frontier in that locality, is now used solely for the irrigation of Afghan territory. , The canals of Seistan have never been used for purposes of water com munication, but there is nothing to prevent Canals for purposes of transport. ^ i ar g e r canals from being so utilized. That they are never employed lor purposes o£ transport, is due probably to the fact that there is no wood suitable for boat-budding found ,n Seistan, and jv s j. • 1 . i-V,„ 1 .. d-l.v.V.nw available. is not buoyant and so rafts cannot There is however nothing to prevent narrow boats or rafts, drawing not more than 2 ' 6 ' of water, passing along any of the main canals. For instance, starting from the Band-i-Seistan, the village of Chilling loould be reached by the Rud-i-Sheb-i-Ab, the Adimi and Zahak canals in Pusht-i-Ab could be navigated to within the proximity of Nasratabad, while boats draw ing not more than 3'could reach a point close to Jeklabad on the edge of the Naizar, when the Helmand was moderately high. COMMUNICATIONS. The whole of the inhabited area of Seistan is, generally speaking, absolutely flat and featureless, though there are scattered over the country a few small hills or mounds, locally known as “ Tappa,”, from which, owing to its extraordinary flatness, and, except in Miankangi, the entire absence of trees, a considerable view of the surrounding country can be obtained. These would be useful in the event of military operations as signalling stations and in a country in which it is extremely difficult to find one’s way, owing to the lack of prominent features, would furnish in many cases excellent landmarks. As the country varies considerably in various parts of Seistan, a short description is given of each of the divisions, already mentioned. MianJcangi.—ln this district the ground, where not cleared for cultivation in small tracts near villages, is covered with Miankangi. tamarisk jungle, varying much in density and height, but throughout forming a great obstacle to movement. Alternate belts are met with, varying from 10 ' to 30' in height, apparently due to the ground having been at some time cleared for cultivation and subsequently neglected. View is consequently 'limited to a few hundred yards, and a guide is always a necessity. The higher jungle would in many places prevent the use of camel transport, until new roads had been cut, or existing paths widened, as the tamarisk branches meet overhead, but mules and donkeys could be employed until this was done.IS ^ NOTES ON PERSIAN SEISTAN. m,/» .-hMp of the southern portion of Miankangi is liable to severe floods, The whole ot the somne . ^ ^ ^ when thcre js mue ^ watcr Floods. in the Halmacd, is rendered almost impass- for transport.

These sandhills are of soft fine sand, and would prevent the move ment of wheeled artillery or transport. _ . . , Sheb-i-Ab.—This is the most extensively cultivated and thickly populated district in Seistan. The soil is uniformly sheb-i-Ab. excellent, entirely free from either sand or tamarisk, and is practically all under cultivation. The number of yoke of oxen told off to each plough is here greater than elsewhere, and the yield of each plough of ground, by which all calculations in Seistan are made, ie greater than in other districts. As a result, the number of canals is great, many of the large villages having a broad and deep canal of their own, lead ing direct from the Rud-i-Sheb-i-Ab, as the Rud-i-Seistan is here called, with subsidiary water-cuts branching off to all the . smaller villages. The difficulty of movement is consequently great and is increased by the soil becoming very heavy and sticky after rain or floods. Extensive bridging operations of a minor kind, for which there is no material close at hand, would be necessary in order to make a road through this district. ROUTES. There is nothing at all resembling a road in Seistan, though there are a number of tracks along the routes mainly used by the Seistanis, which, except in the few places where there are fords, are provided with narrow bridges sufficiently strong to bear, at most, a single loaded camel. For wheeled artillery or transport to be able to move, it would be necessary to bridge the required roads throughout, in which case it would be as easy to do this directly between any two points desired as along the existing tracks, which are usually circuitous. Except in the localities about to be enumerated, there is nothing to prevent the movement of wheeled artillery or transport anywhere in the inhabited area, when the canals had been bridged. Consequently the negative method of pointing out tracts of country to be avoided, if possible, will prove more useful than enumerating the existing tracks. The former from north to south are as follows Miankangi.— The country lying to the south of Burj-i-Mirgul as far as the Baud-i-Parian. The tamarisk jungle is Miankangi. here high and dense, and the ground liable to severe floods. Puskt-i-Ab.—From Deh Masti Khan, near which village the Rud-i- Fusht-i-Ab Hasicki, the main Pusht-i-Ab canal separates it into a dozen different channels, in a north westerly direction for about three miles. Here there is a network of canals lying close to one another, which would require bridging, for which purpose there is no timber close at hand.

Except in Bridge*. kangi, and there only in sufficient for local requirements, no timber is available for bridging purposes. C 0I %, quently an adequate supply of spars and planks should be brought witu_anj,— troops operating in Seistan. i , • The depth of the majority of canals does not exceed 6 , a few only being as much as 8' deep in flood time, the greatest depth I noted being 10 in the Rnd-i-Seistan near Khwaja Ahmed; while the average breadth of the larger canals is from 20 ' to 25 ', and of the smaller ones 12 to 15 . Pontoons.'—P ot bridging the main Ibranches of the Halmanu, it won..d PontoonB. be advisable to bring pontoons. The current is strong at flood time and the bed of the river soft mnu and sand, which scours rapidly. After three days’ work at making an attempt to cross the Rud-i-Parian with the Seistan Boundary Commission, iu March 1908 , by filling in the deep channel with loose fascines of tamarisk, a depth of 6' was found to have scoured to a depth of 12, and work hui to be suspended. TotNOTES ON PERSIAN SEISTAN. V3 19- Along the main tracks in Seistan, there are fords through all the canals which are too wide to be bridged by I, ° rd8 ‘ local methods. The absence however of stone and gravel, and the soft nature of the soil, which becomes very slippery when wet, would make it preferable to bridge all but the smaller water-cuts, if any considerable amount of traffic was required to pass. Except to the east of a line drawn from Shahristan Hill to Jelalabad, no fuel is to be found. The fuel Puoi • for other districts is carried from Miankangi on donkeys, and in the western districts is an expensive commodity in winter. Consisting as it does of roots and small branches of tamarisk, a large amount would be necessary for military purposes Tamarisk wood is heavy and does not float, so that some arrangement would have to be made with skins or otherwise to float it down the river or canals. Fater.—The water of the Halmand resembles that of the Nile, in that it contains fertilising properties, though in a Water for drmkmg purposes. ml , c h lesser degree. It consequently would not be so injurious to the health of British troops, except during the time of the first flood. Then, especially after a low Halmand, the river brings down a large amount of filth of all sorts, besides alluvial deposit, and would probably cause dysentery and kindred complaints. The water of the canals in Seistan is seldom really clear owing to the constant minor irrigation operations, and to the traffic passing through the numerous fords. Filters. —It would probably prove advantageous to make arrangements for filtering water for British troops, as was ]Pilte^B • done in the Soudan in 1 S 98 . Wells.—Water can be found practically throughout Seistan at a depth of from 5 ' to 15 ' below the surface of the ground, and wells can be quickly dug owing to the softness of the soil. The well-water however is nearly always muddy. V CLIMATE. A description of the climate of Seistan resolves itself into an account o ^ the local winds, which are almost incessant, of extraordinary violence and uniformity as regards direction. Both the summer and winter gales blow practically from the north alwayg^^/ and their regularity may be gauged from the fact that all the trees slant U a considerable angle towards the south, while no opening is ever made on th^ - north side of a house in Seistan. In the summer time one usually sees everyone walking, heeling over against the wind, as on board ship in a storm, while the shrill and piercing voices of the inhabitants, who invariably shout to each other from quite close even on a still day, are undoubtedly due to the difficulty experienced ia making themselves heard while the “ Bad-i-sad-o-bist-roz” blows.

H- ^7 EESOURCES. Wheat and barley are the only products of any importance in Seistan, thr^ A amount of other produce grown being quite Wheat and barley. inconsiderable. I estimate the number oe '‘ploughs” as 1 , 830 , which, allowing an average output of Kharwars 65 pef ^‘7 plough gives a total of Kharwars 118,950 or mtunda aloutturn ' 1,784,250Indian 1 , 784,250 Indian maunds. The estimated output of each plough, as originally reckoned for the payment of revenue to the Persian Government, was 36 Kharwars per plough only, but from careful enquiries I consider the outturn at the present time to be far greater. As the Katkhudas of villages have to provide free labour, when required, to the Local Government, calculated on the basis of the number of ploughs belonging to their respective villages, and as also the amount of “shirini” or “backshish” from time to time required from them in order to retain possession of their villages varies according to the amount of cultiva tion belonging to them, it is obviously to their advantage to make out the number of ploughs as low as possible. Consequently in many places, and especially in the fertile district of Sheb-i-Ab, there are relays of men and oxen told off for each plough, and the extent of ground cultivated is much increased, though the number of ploughs remains the same. 1 have been informed that as much as 100 Kharwars per plough are obtained from certain specially fertile land, and I do not think that to reckon 65 Kharwars as tue output of each plough would be an over estimate. It is probable that large stores of grain would always be found in the larger villages, and especially in Jazmak, ▼mages ° f grain in the lar8er Sehkoba, and Iskel. Euquiries have always elicited the same reply, that there is enough grain to feed an army in each of these three villages. The reason for the storage of grain is probably a distrust of the local Government, with the consequent desire to have a supply put by for a rainy day, and also to the feeling that the water of the Halmand being in latter days indifferently controlled, cultivation in any locality is always liable to be destroyed by either a too great or too small supply of water. The export of grain, north to Kain, and south to Kerman and Baluchistan, . is estimated at 100,000 camel-loads of 5 xpor o gram. Indian maunds each, of which four-fifths goes to Kain and one-fifth to the south. There appears to be no reason why the present cultivated area should not „ be largely extended. There is an ample Possibility of increase. i p , • j- i supply of water m ordinary years, and besides the possibility of re-opening old canals to the south and again fertilis- ing the ground formerly cultivated between Seistan and Koh-i-Malik Siah, it would probably be possible, by cutting a channel to drain the water of the Hamun southwards into the Shela river, to reclaim a great part of the area at present liable to inundation. In many places, where I have visited the edge of the Hamun, the ground has not appeared salt, or in any way different trom the cultivated land close by. There are about 1,000 horses in Seistan, which are small and wiry, but Horses, i.ooo. unable to carry much weight.O' uJ 24 NOTES ON PERSIAN SHISTAN. Mules are not bred locally, and with the exception of 95 belonging to tho Mules, os. Hashmafc-ul-Mulk there are none. There are said to be 2 , 14.1 camels, of which the owners belong to Seisfcan, but probably not more than two-thirds of this number would be available, as many are ■cattered with caravans between Kaiu, Kerman, and Quetta. They carry not more than 3 | maunds, and many are unable to carry even as much. There are no riding camels in Seistan. Donkeys, practically the sole means of local transport, I estimate to ■nonVflvn n 724 number 9 , 724 . They carry a maund to a maund and a half at about miles an hour. The number of cattle has, apparently, been much under-estimated in n *41 rinn previous reports. A large number died during the recent severe drought, but last year ( 1902 - 03 ) Tomans 4,800 were paid to the Government for the privilege of collecting the cow-tax, which at the rate of 1 kran per head, makes the total number 48 , 000 . It is probable that the individual who farms the tax does not lose money however, and so this figure is likely to be short of the mark. The number of sheep and goats must beat least 250 , 000 , of which it is Sheep and eoate. 250,000. f ti “ ated ‘ bat “T* 6 ”* 9 shee P ani1 one : tenth goats. A tax of 1 kran per 15 head used to be levied, but a year or two ago this was increased, and 1 kran for every ten is the present rate. As the sum of Tomans 2,500 was paid to the Amir by the individual who collected this tax, the number of sheep and goats must be at least 250 , 000 . Dost Muhammad, the Chief of the Saruni Baluohis in Seietan, who farmed this tax last year, admitted to me that he had not lost money over the bargain, though he naturally objected to stating the amount he had made, so the number is probably somewhat in excess of the above figure. The population in round numbers appears to be about 100,000. This Population includes the nomads, who grazed their herds and flocks in the outlying parts of Seistan, as well as the village population. ETHNOGRAPHY. It would be a matter of some difficulty to detail all the different trikes that have at various times migrated to Seistan and there found a home, and indeed this would serve no useful purpose, for the successive waves of conquest which have swept over this fertile province, have left but little power and influence remaining to many formerly important tribes, while smaller clans have lost their individuality owing to inter-marriage with other clans and to having discarded their nomadic habits, and adopted a rural life in Seistan, where they have gradually become absorbed in the mixed population of the country. None of the tribes which will shortly be described, are of any importance from a military point of view. They are not tribal units in the sense that their head-men could place even a few hundred fighting men in the field, or compel his adherents to oppose a foreign occupation of their country. The tribes at present of most importance in Seistan are the following Sinjarani, Nahrui, Sarbandi, Sharaki, Kaiani, Saruni, Jemalzai, Gurgicb, Khimmar, Mir, and Saids.KOTOS ON PERSIAN BEI8TAN. it &lt;+1 In addition to the above there are a large number of “ Taifa ” or small clans, both of Seistanis and Baluchis, as the •• Taifft ” or small clans. inhabitants of many small villages and encampments of u Siah Chadir ” or &lt;f Black tents , adopt the name of their Katkhuda and constitute, according to their own account, a separate clan. Names of tribes are also derived from names of villages, such as Khadri, Shahriari, Allahsufi, etc., while in other cases rSeTofviiiails. 8 derived from names derived from a trade or occupation have been adopted. Examples of the latter are the Sayad or “ Hunters ”, who are found along the borders of the Naizar, where they gain a livelihood by netting and Names of clans derived irom shooting wild-fowl, and the Miscrars or trades or occupations. . “coppersmiths” who are now recognised locally as a separate Seistani * Taifa/ Again, there are instances of names of clans being derived from the sobri quet of a particular man such as Diwana, nSw? 1 name ' deri ved from nick- Kul, etc. The latter word is the name of a . species of kite, which is found among old ruins and out-of-the-way places, and the term was applied originally to the head of a Seistani family, who used to pitch his tent in a lonely spot amongst the old ruins of Zahidan, and there live in retirement with his family. His descendants are now known as belonging to the &lt;e Kul ” clan. The members of these small tribes have in the course of time become scattered throughout the different villages of Seistan, and owe allegiance to no tribal chief. It would be of no use therefore to enumerate a lonw list of mere names, and a short account is given only of the more influential tribeg before alluded to, with genealogical trees, omitting those which have already been described in other reports. KAIANI. The Kaianis, of whom the headmen have the title of Malik, are the descendants of the old Kiani Kings of Persia, Kaikobad, Kai Khnsrau, etc., who retained their power in Seistan until the time of Nadir Shnh. The 'ilr Vi C'bief who possessed any considerable influence in Seistan was Malik Snliman Khan, whose great-grandson, Malik Gulzar Khan, is their • ^ er * ^ a ^ er now ^ves in Daolatabad in Miankangi, where he - retains the courtly manners and ceremonious habits of his ancestors, though shorn of almost all his power and influence. Many years ago Malik »uJ?.ar Khan and his brother, Malik Abbas Khan, quarrelled with Mir Alum the then Governor of Seistan, whereupon the latter reported the dispute to iehran, and orders were received from the Shah to confiscate all their property. The brothers consequently fled to Kabnl, where they were hospitably entertained by the Amir, Sbere Ali. Three years later Mir Alum made over ures of reconciliation to them, and the brothers returned to Seistan, but e promises that had been held out to them, that all their property should res ored, were not fulfilled.

Gulzar Khan was deprived some years ago of Bahramabad where he had got into trouble owing to having killed Dost Muhammad, father of the present Katkhuda of Kul, as a result of a dispute about the irrio-ation water of their respective villages, and now lives with a small followino- in Daolatabad. Although deprived of practically all their power and propertv the Kianis are still treated with consideration and respect, on account of their descent.

With the exception of the Nabrui, Sarbandi, Sharaki, and Sinjarani. almost all the Baluch inhabitants of Seistan belong to the Taoki tribes, and are consequently under the influence of the Sinjarani. These tribes, which are said to number 22, and vary greatly in size and importance, were, accord ing to local tradition, founded by one Jind, Sinjarani, some four or five generations ago. This man came from Sibi in Sind to Chageh, which was at that time peopled chiefly bv Naotani Baluchis, some of whom attached themselves to Jind. The latter being a wealthy man, his women-folk used to wear rich ornaments, among which the “ Tank ” or * necklace' was espec’ally fine, whence the tribes derived the name of Taoki. In course of time many of the smaller tribes under the Naotanis trans ferred their allegiance to the Sinjaranis, and finally the Naotanis themselves joined them. The Taoki tribes gradually wandered from Chageh to Garmeel, and later followed Jam Beg, Sinjarani, to Rudbar, and thence accompanied Khan Jehan Khan into Seistan. . The following are the Taoki tribes in Seistan, who all own allegiance to the Sinjaranis:— Name o{ tribe. Naotnoi . Jenalzai . Gurgich .. Raklishani D.hmurda Isa/ai • fihah ozai • Kharot • Saparzai .

The Sarunis, who are one of the faoki tribes of Baluchis, are mostly found in the Mahals of Bur-i-Mirgul, Deh Dost Mohammed, Padai, Margon, Pulgi and in the north of the Miankangi district generally, and number abont’450 families who all live in Persian territory.

The Gurgich, who are a Taoki/ tribe, followed Jam Beg and Khan J m Khan, Sinjarani, from Chageh through Garmsel to Seistan. The tribe is said now to comprise five sub-divisions, of which one only, the Singakzai, live in Seistan, the remaining four, the Lashkarizai, Haseanzai, Gabarzai, and Ovadzai, being domiciled in Afghanistan. Their first Chief was Reis, who was at their head when they came to Seistan, and after his death, his two sons, Ibrahim Ketchi and Pasand Khan, were on good terms with Mir Alum Khan, then Governor of Seistan; when the latter was summoned to Tehran by the Shah, the two brothers did not get on with Mir Jafar Kban, who was sent to take over the Governorship, and crossed over into Afghan territory, whence, in order to assist Mir Alum by showing how much stronger his rule was than his successors, they continually raided the caravans coming to and leaving Seistan. . As a reward, when the Governorship was restored to Mir Alum, Pasand Khan was given the village of Kimak and later on Schkoha, Kimak oeing passed on to his son Khan Mohammed, while Ibrahim Ketchi was appointed Katkhuda of Sherifabad and Shahristan. Subsequently when the Hashmat- ul-Mulk succeeded Mir Alum, Pasand Khan, considering he had a grievance, went to Meshed to lodge a complaint, but was taken ill and died there, and Sehkoha was given to Purdil Khan, Sarbandi.80 NOTES ON PERSIAN 8EISTAN. Sometime after this, Derweish Khan, Nahrui, was returning from Tehran with an order from the Shah, that all their former lands, which included Kimak, Sherifabad, and Shahristan, should be restored to the Nahruis. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk pointed out to Ibrahim Ketchi the loss this would entail for himself and the Gurgich tribe, and persuaded him •with the aid of a few congenial spirits, to murder Derweish Khan at Asbak near Tabbas. Ibrahim Ketchi then returned to Seietan, where Mir Ma^asum was Deputy Governor, and the latter hearing of his cousin Derweish Khan’s murder had him imprisoned. Ibrahim escaped, however,and after spending some days* in the thick tamarisk jungle near Shahristan, gained the Afghan border. It is related that he returned to Persian territory later, where he died from poison accidentally given him by his wife. The Gurgich tribe, of whom Nawab Khan, Katkhuda of Deh, Ali Akbar, is the present Chief, is said to number some 800 families, divided equally between Persian and Afghan territory, and inhabit chiefly the district lying between Kobak, Shahristan, and the Band-i-Parian.

It is said that this tribe is descended from Kimbrani Baluchis, who came to Seistan, about seven generations ago, from Kharan in Baluchistan. In later years' they have gradually become more influential, and two of their number, Katkhuda Asghar of Kala-i-Nao, and Katkhuda Derweish of Daodi were important men in Seistan. The latter participated in Sardar Sherif Khan’s attack on Mir Alum Khan in Husseinabad, and when the attack failed, fled with the rest to Afghan territory, returning however later when Mir Jafar Khan came to succeed Mir Alum Khan as Governor. _ The Khimmars are now connected by marriage with the Sarbandis, Sarunis, and Jemalzais, their present Chief being Fakir Mohammed of Daodi. The Khimmars, of whom there are said to be some two hundred and fifty families in Seistan, are found chiefly in Daodi, Luf, Tilfak, Deh Siahsar, Deh Mir Beg, Deh Mohammed Abdulla, and Deh Ali Jan Nasir, while smaller tribes under their auspices areZor, Sinchuli, and Gallawi.

Previous reports on the province of Seistan have described fully the system of administration at present in force, and these notes therefore are confined to a general description of the cultivation of wheat and barley, which, together with cattle and sheep rearing, is practically the sole occupation of the inhabitants, and which is the source of the wealth of the province. A statement showing the revenue paid by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to the Shah for the province of Seistan, or the basis upon which the revenue is calculated, would give no truer indication of the amount actually paid by the former to the latter, than would a detailed account of the shares of the crops obtained by the Katkhudas and the workmen and cultivators, represent the actual amount received by these different classes. The whole adrninis- tration is run on the system universal throughout Persia, that each individual should extract as much as possible from the man next below him, with the additional disadvantage that everything in the country is the absolute property of the Shah. As regards the revenue paid by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to the Shah, I was informed by the Belgian Director of Customs, M. Maurice, that he had been called upon last Naoroz to furnish a statement of all the various pro ducts of the country, with a view to its being known at Tehran to what extent the Amir could be squeezed before he was compelled to relinquish the Governorship of the province. The extractions are of course passed on by the Amir to the Katkhudas, and by the latter to the cultivators, who are the largest losers. Instead of showing therefore an exact statement of the shares of the various officials, and the cultivators, an account is given of the general manner in which the operation of “ Kerman Kashi ” or “ the division of the harvest ” is conduoted. The shares of the different officials and classes, with the exception of that of the Governor, vary slightly in different districts, but as far as possible a general average has been taken. Besides the share of the harvest, which is paid to the Local Government, the chief source of revenue is the tax upon animals, which is alluded to in another part of this report. SYSTEM OF CULTIVATION IN SEISTAN, AND METHOD OF “DIVISION OF THE HARVEST.” The cultivation in Seistan suffers greatly owing to the system in force, which limits the tenure of land to one year, both for the Katkhuda and for the small cultivator, and which allows no one to become the possessor of the freehold of the land. The necessary result is that efforts on the part of either of these classes, whether to better fertilise the land, inaugurate improvements in house-build* ing, or plant trees either for fruit bearing or fot fuel, only entail the payment of a larger amount of “ Shirini ”, in proportion to the extent of the improvements made, in order to remain in possession of their property the following year. Should he be unable to find the necessary ready money, the tenant is ejected and sees the fruits of his labours enjoyed by a new comer, who has been able to pay the necessary bribe to acquire the village or land.notes on pbbsian seistan.

The ploughman or cultivator does not himself reap his crop, but employs a “ daraogar ” or reaper, who after cutting Daraogar or reaper. 2 q handfuls for the owner of the corn, is allowed to cut and lay aside one handful for himself. The operation of reap ing usually lasts for about six weeks, when the reaped corn is collected in open spaces near the village, called “ Ja-i-Kharman”, or “ Place of the harvest and surrounded by a rough fence of tamarisk known as ‘‘ting”. Here it is left untouched, watched over by the “ Mishkar ” or “ Watcher appointed by the Government, until the “ Sar Mushrif ” comes to the village, and puts patches of mud over the mounds, on which he places his seal. There are four “Sar Mushrifs” or Head Agents in Seistan, one for each district, the Nahrui and Sharaki “Mahals” being counted as one. Under these officials are the Mushrifs or sub-agents, of whom there is usually one for every five ploughs throughout the country. When the corn in the whole of a “Mahal” or district is notified as ready to he assessed, the '‘Sar Mushrif” makes a tour of the whole, and, with the “ Mushrif ” in each locality, divides the corn.

Also all changes in appointments ,n Persia usually take place about the time of Naoroz in March, that is when the crops are half-grown, and the Katkhuda has not much inducement to extend the cultivation of his village, when he is never certain of remaining in possession even until next har Also^the system of bribery, which is in force equally for the husbandmen who may be trying to induce the iowner of a pair of oxen to join a group and complete the number necessary in order to obtain a plough of land from the Katkbuda, as for the latter in order to continue in possession of his village the ensuing year, leads to an immense amount of hagg ing, an bargaining and consequent delay. Thus it is that ploughing and sowing is often commenced much too late in the season. _ . - . In short, the immense quantity of corn which is at present producea m Seistan, is entirely due to the natural fertility of the soil and appears to grow in spite of a system, which might have been designed expressly in order o check its growth. It may be imagined therefore what the produce of the whole province anight be under a more enlightened administration.4^ HOTBS ON FEE8IAN SEISTAN. POLITICAL. The political situation has changed greatly during the last few years, that is since the arrival of British and Russian Political officers on the scene, and Seistan has now become, comparatively speaking, a civilised country, where a knowledge of French is as necessary as a knowledge of Persian. The change in the political situation has necessitated the despatch of Persian officials from Tehran, with the result that the authority of the Central Government is now the chief factor to be reckoned with. The change has consequently not been for the better from the point of view of British interests. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Chief Sardars, who previously exercised great authority and influence locally, have now lost most of their powers which will in all probability continue to decrease in the course of the next few years. At the present time the situation is such that when the Amir and his younger but legitimate son, Mir Ma’asum, are in Seistan the Nahrui and Sinjarani Sardars, Said Khan and Khan Jan Khan, become influential, while with the departure of the Amir and Mir Ma’asum and the advent of Mohammed Reza, the Amir’s elder but illegitimate son, Sardar Purdil Khan, the Sarbandi Chief, whose daughter Mohammed Reza has married, becomes an important figure. However, the day of all these local chiefs is passed, and in the course of conversation with intelligent Seistanis, at the time of the arrival of the Boundary Commission, I found they all considered that the local Government and men of local influence and standing, were of no importance compared with the Persian officials, who had arrived with Teheran influence at their backs. •The main bulk of the population, whether Seistanis or Baluchis—and it 10 difficult to distinguish the one from the other—»have no martial spirit, arc ill-armed when armed at all, and, in the event of a disturbance, could neither protect themselves nor afford real help to others. Moreover, the poorer classes openly avow their wish that either the Russians or ourselves, no matter which, would take possession of Seistan and relieve them from the oppression of the present Governor, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. From a military point of view, the latter, the tribal chiefs, and indeed the whole population may be disregarded. SEISTANI DIALECT. The Seistani is far more closely allied to the Persian spoken in Afghanis* tan, than to that of Persia, the terminations of many of the words being clipped or contracted, especially in the case of verbal terminations. Many of the words in the vocabulary that follows are merely the contractions everywhere used by uneducated people, c y., birazdah for biradah zadab, meaning a brother’s son,” but the Seistanis are slow at understanding words not pronounced exactly as they have always heard them pronounced, and sc they have been included. The chief difficulty for anyone, who has previously studied modern Persian, in talking to Seistanis, is that the latter only understand one word for each thing or idea, and until that particular word is employed, they do not grasp what is meant, though they themselves may use the same word, with a closely allied meaning, a moment later.68 NOTES ON PERSIAN SBISTAN, Vocabulary of Seistani Dialect —contd.

From Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner for Seistan Arbitration Commission, To L. W. Dane, Esq., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Since I last bombarded you with letters just before you started for the Persian Gulf, I have given you a fairly long respite. Many thanks for your long letter of 5th January . I know how busy you are, and it is very good of you to write. \ As for ourselves, we are slowly marking time along the Border, ready&gt; to begin demarcation work directly the Amir writes accepting my award. So far all this'delay is playing our game, but I am very anxious to polish off demarcation without further delay, as the time is approaching when the rivers wall rise, and the country from Kohak northwards will get hope lessly difficult to work in. After demarcation I can always delay as long as is necessary in giving the water award, and I do not propose to give that until I get a ‘Mine clear” from, you. 'We have been having a more than ordinary rough time of it for some weeks what with snow, cold, and wet. We are all fit and well, however, and very well case hardened to weather. Duck shooting has been a total failure, so life is very monotonous. No one will play with us now-a-days. I did think we might have a little innocent amusement with the passport system, but the Yamin scented danger, and has ordered the passport business to be stopped while the Mission is here. This is subject, of course, to sanction from Tehran, and they may be foolish enough to start it again. The Customs are again giving trouble, and I have had to send a rather strongly worded telegram to Tehran. We are all willing to stay on here as long as we are serving a useful purpdse, but I sincei’ely trust we may be spared another Seistan summer. Apart from other troubles, a Seistan summer in tents is fearfully trying to one's eyes, owing to heat, wind, dust, and glare. I have some misgivings as to how my own optics will stand another summer. They are somewhat the worse for wear already. We are by no means idle here, and are working away steadily with survey, irrigation, and general investigation work. We have made innumerable lines of levels across Seistan in every possible direction, and these will be some day of great interest and value. I have also nearly completed what may be called a settlement report of the country, both Afghan and Seistan, which contains a great mass of detailed local information. The more one works at this country the more astonishing its possibilities prove to be. W T e find we can rely on a larger area of culturable and commandable ground than that stated in my previous report;—also that any high level canal taken from or above Bund-i-Kamal Khan would bring large areas of Dasht in Persian Seistan, not included in former calculations, under flood irrigation. Another very important discovery is that of very large, extensive, and natural storage reservoirs in Persian Seistan itself, where flood water can be easily stored and used for irrigating large low-lying areas, thereby ensuring their cultivation in years of low river, and enabling in ordinary years the water now expended on those areas to be used elsewhere. I am glad too to find that good cotton can be grown in Seistan. This would be an important asset, if encouraged. As far as Persian Seistan is concerned, the present population would suffice to carry out all possible extensions of cultivation. They can be a hardworking people when they like, but the present iniquitous revenue svstem prevents their cultivating more than enough for bare subsistence. We should have no trouble with them, for they openly express the hope that we will take over this country some day, and are fond of talking among themselves of the agricultural progress they would make under our rule. It would be a safe and profitable investment to lend Persia some 1^ millions on the hypothecation of Seistan alone, or to pay £60,000 per annum for the lease of it. This is a merely commercial view of the case. It would pay to increase those figures from the strategic point of view. If, as I think is probable, we hear more of the sale of Seistan revenue grain to the Bussian Bank, there need be no logical impediment to our demanding the sale or lease to us of Seistan revenues. As next door proprietors to Seistan, we have the right of preemption. 1 here are other matters in your letter which I am carefully considering and will write about them separately later. The issue of present negotiations between Japan and Russia will materially affect the treatment of these and similar problems. How encouraging it must be to read tbe drivel that is being talked at home about political moves so obviously important and imperative as Tibet. Cotton is capable of any thing, but it did surprise me to hear that Fitzpatrick strongly opposed action in Tibet on the ground that our army in India is not large enough. I hope you are none the worse for all the heavy strain of recent work.1 (Received informally from the Tehran Legation on the 4th April 1904.) Concessions in force in Persia—December 1903 Railway—Tehran to Shahahdulazim. Concessionaire, Fabius Boital. No date specified but granted about 1886.

Poliakoff of Moscow. Imperial Bank of Rersia. ConcessiongrantedtoBaronG.de Reuter on January 30th, 1889, for sixty years. The paid-up capital of the Bank was originally £1,000,000, subsequently reduced by the writing off of losses to £650,000.

The present note issue varies from £250,000 to £300,000. Advances to the Government may not exceed one-third of the paid-up capital. The majority of the Board is to he of British nationality. The Bank has the monopoly of the issue of paper money payable to hearer on presentation. Originally the concession under certain conditions included the mining rights in Persia of eight different minerals. These rights were ceded to the Persian Bank Mining Rights Cor poration in 1890 for £150,000 cash and £600,000 in shares. The Corporation after spending £120,000 between 1890-1893 in prospecting, freight of plant, etc., liquidated in 1891 and the Imperial Bank of Persia Mining Rights lapsed in 1901. Russian Banque d'Escompte et de Brets de Perse. Concession granted to M. Jacques Poliakoff of St. Petersburg, 1890, for seventy-five years.

The electric light rights lapsed and were given in 1902 to the late Hakim •ul-Mulk, Yazir Darbar, who, before his death in 1903, ordered extensive plant from Europe, but nothing has yet been done to introduce electric light in Tehran. The telephone rights are not clear. Telephone concession. Granted April 12th, 1903, to the Moayer-ul-Mamalek. Eor all Persia for 60 years. Under Article YII the concessionaire may dispose of his rights to another person or company and the Moayer-ul-Mamalek is at present trying to sell the concession either to the Russian Bank or to an English company should he be able to find any one in London willing to take the matter up.

The road is to run from Julfa on the Russian Frontier to Tabriz and Kazvin. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz has reported that work will begin in 1901 as soon as the weather permits both at Julfa and Tabriz. The road has been surveyed from Julfa to Zenjan. In connection with this road an additional concession for the working of naphtha and coal situated on each side of the road to a distance of lOfarsakhs (10 miles) was granted to the Banque d’Escompte et de Prets de Perse in March 1902.

No work has as yet been undertaken.1 (Received informally from the Tehran Legation on the dth April 1904.) Narrative of Events in Persia in 1903. At the beginning of the year the Executive Government of Persia was still in the hands of Ali Asghar Khan, Atabeg-i-Azam, although a strong party at Court, headed by the Hakim-ul-Mulk, was gradually undermining his power and weakening his influence over the Shah. During the month of January negotiations were carried on between His Majesty’s Minister and the Persian Government with a view to the drawing up of a Commercial Agree ment similar in character to that signed in October 1901 between Persia and sir a. Hardings telegram No. 16-Commerdai of Prussia. This agreement was signed bv February 9th. 1903 . Sir A. Hardinge on February 9th, and the new tariff came into effect on the 14th of the same month. The ratifica tions were exchanged on May 27th, 1903. During the latter part of 1902 the Persian Government had intimated their willingness to depute an official to meet a representative of His Majesty’s Government to demarcate the Perso-Beluch frontier from the vicinity of Padaha to Koh-i-Malik-Siah. Colonel A. H. McMahon, llevenue Commissioner in Beluchistan, was selected as British representative and was also appointed arbitrator in the dispute which had arisen as to the frontier between Seistan and Afghanistan. The Yamin Nizam was appointed Persian Commissioner and Afghanistan was also represented. During January and February efforts were made by the Bussian Minister at lehran to force the Shah to sanction the presence of a Russian official on the boundary commission. Under the pressure to bear by M. Vlassow, the Atabeg- i-Azam proposed that the work of demarcation should be postponed or that Russia should be represented. The Persian Government also raised difficul ties owing to the exaggergated reports which had been spread of the size of Colonel McMahon’s escort. The view of the matter taken by His Majesty’s Government may be summed up in the words of the last portion of Lord Lansdowne’s note to Count Benckendorff of February 21st. “I cannot find in our archives any document which can be regarded as giving the Russian Government a right of intervention in the matter of the Arbitration now proceeding in Seistan as to the claims of the Persians and Afghans to the use of the water of the Helmund. The British and Russian Governments have, it is true, on more than one occasion agreed to respect the integrity of Persia and there is. a Despatch from Lord Granville to Lord A. Loftus of July 10th, 1873, in which he records a conversa ion with Count Brunnow upon this point. It can, however, scarcely be contended that an arbitration for the purposes of settling a local dispute as to water rights can be regarded as affecting the general principle of the integrity of Persia, or that such assurances as those given by Lord Granville in any way derogate from the light of this country to act as arbitrator in accordance with the Treaty of 1857.’ J Early in February a special Mission under Viscount Downe arrived at Tehran for the purpose of investing the Shah with the Order of the Garter The Mission was cordially received by the Persian Authorities and remained in lehran about ten days. Shortly after Lord Downe’s departure the Hakim-ul- Mulk and the Moayyed-ed-Dowleh received the G. C. M. G., the Mohandis-ul- Mamalek the K. C. M. G., and Hussein Kuli Khan the C. B. The Atabe°--i- Azam received the G. C. B. in brilliants, and several of the great officers°of State handsome presents. In February it became necessary for the Atabeg to find money and the Persian Government attempted to obtain an advance from the Russian Bank on the security of the royalties on the Caspian Fisheries. After considerable delay the Russian Bank consented to advance the money required but imposed conditions which the Persian Government were unwilling to accept. An an. fc tlon was t]lon made to the Imperial Bank of Persia for an advance of from £200,000 to £300,000. As the Bank was unable to lend so large a sum His Majesty s Minister suggested that His Majesty’s Government should advancethe money, the Bank appearing as the nominal lender. After communicating with the Government of India, it was arranged as the basis for the loan, that £300,000, which might later be increased to £500,000 in return for further conditions, should be lent by that Government at 4 per cent, interest to the Imperial Bank of Persia, the joint risk for payment of the principle and inter est of the loan being accepted by the British and Indian Governments. Of the above sum £300,000 was to be advanced atonce to the Persian Government at 4 per cent., the Bank charging 1 per cent, commission for its services. The security was to be the Caspian Pisheries and the revenue derived from the Southern Customs. Effectual precautions were to be taken against (1) reim bursement by Kussia whenever it suited her, (2) the possibility of a Russo- Persian Bank undertaking at some future date a discount or other operation in connection with the Customs of Southern Persia. A loan agreement to the following effect was finally signed at Tehran on April 8th : — (1) The Imperial Bank to lend the Persian Government £200,000 at 5%. (2) The Persian Government to repay the said advance, capital and interest, in 20 years out of the proceeds of the royalties on the Caspian Fisheries. (3) Should the Caspian Fisheries revenues be insufficient to secure the regular repayment of the advance, the Persian Government to pay the amounts requisite for that purpose out of the revenues of the Posts and Telegraphs, and out of the revenues of the Customs of Fars and the Persian Gulf should the former be insufficient. During the first months of 1903 several important changes occurred in the Governors of the various Provinces. The chief of these were in Khorasan and Kerman where the Rukn-ed-Dowleh and the Zafer-es-Sultaneh, respectively, replaced the Nair-ed-Dowleh and the Ala-ul-Mulk. The Ala-ed-Dowleh was appointed Governor-General of Fars and His Highness Prince Herman Ferma succeeded him in Kermanshah. In March General Kossakovsky, who had for many years commanded the Cossack Brigade at Tehran, resigned and was succeeded by Colonel Tchernozouiboff. Early in April His Majesty’s Consul-General in Odessa reported that the Russian Government had granted the Russian Steam Navigation Company a subsidy of 200,000 roubles a year for ten years in consideration of four sailings a year to the Persian Gulf. The Russian Government were to retain a prevaFl- ing voice in the selection of the Company's representative in the Gulf. Towards the end of April serious disturbances took place at Meshed and were probably encouraged by the local Russian representative with a view to bringing about the recall of the Nayer-ed-Dowleh, Governor-General of Khor asan. The result of the riots was the resignation of the Nayer-ed-Dowleh. The desire of the Indian Government that the Imperial Bank should establish a branch in Seistan was realised in May by the acceptance by the Directors of the conditions proposed by the Indian Government viz a maximum subsidy of £1,500 a year for five years, that maximum to be reduced by the amount of any net profits after the deduction of ordinary expenses including interest at the rate of 5 percent, per annum on the capital allotted to the branch. r During the last week in May the Grand Yizier succeeded in persuadim the Shah to appoint Ins rival, the Hakim-ul-Mulk, Governor of Gilan and si remove his principal opponent from Tehran. The alleged reason for the Atabeg’! action was that be could not reform the finances of Persia unless the Hakim-ul Mulk was prevented from thwarting his efforts in that direction. His Highnes: Sir A. Hardinge’s telegram No. 75 of May 27tL, 1904. aCCUSed his rival of having inspire! against the Shah and the Persian Government.^^^ 10118 paraplllets dire cte( 23 On May 24th Sir A. Hardinge, by direction of Lord Lansdowne, addressed a note to the Persian Government regarding the separation of the Customs Administration of Arabistan from that of the remaining ports of Southern Persia which are under the “Direction Generale” of Bushire. 11S 110 e states that the separation of Mohammerah for Customs purposes from the other ports of the Persian Gulf might, in the absence of a clear declaration o le contrary, give rise to an impression that the Customs revenues of Arams an were excluded from the term “ Customs of Pars and the Persian Gull usee in tbe Russian Loan contracts of 1900 and 1902, and were therefore pledge to the service of the loans created by these two agreements. Tbe note con cludes by asking for an official assurance from tbe Persian jovernmen ia Mohammerah and its dependencies, including all tbe ports of Arabistan, are still comprised with tbe remaining Southern Custom Houses m the term “ Pars and the ports of the Persian Gulf ” employed in the loan contracts with Russia of 1900 and 1902. To this note the Persian Government returned an evasive reply to the effect that for administrative and Customs purposes Pars and Arabistan had always been separate, that they were only united recently as a temporary measure for Customs purposes and that tbe question whether Mohammerab was to be considered as a Gulf port vas one tor Geographers to determine. Early in June serious riots took place at Tabriz and Isfahan. In tbe case of tbe former the mob were incited to violence by the preaching of the local Mullahs against the new tariff and the Belgian Customs officials.. At Isfahan tbe riots were directed against tbe Babis by tbe notorious Mujtehed Agba Nejefi. In tbe same month tbe Government of India appointed a native agent at Kerbela with a view to exercising influence over the principal Mullahs of that place and Nejef. In June His Majesty’s Consul at Batoum reported that M. Govsky, Agent of tbe Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company at Bushire, and M. Pavloff bolding tbe same appointment at Bussorah, bad been instructed to or ganise museums in those towns exhibiting complete collections of products and articles of export manufactured by different firms in Russia. Considerable correspondence took place during tbe first six months of 1903 between tbe British and Persian Governments regarding tbe Russian cholera cordon in Khorasan. On July 1st, a memorandum was addressed to Count Benckendorff pointing the various reasons why this cordon should be withdrawn. Tbe memorandum concluded with the following words : — &lt;f In these circumstances and in view of tbe fact that tbe Persian Govern ment have repeatedly pressed for the withdrawal of tbe Russian Sanitary Cordon, His Majesty’s Government are compelled to arrive at tbe conclusion that its maintenance is not only irregular and unnecessary, but constitutes at tbe same time an encroachment upon the sovereign rights of Persia whose integrity and independence they and the Russian Government are equally interested in maintaining. His Majesty’s Government would therefore express the hope that tbe Russian Government will see fit to take early steps for tbe withdrawal of their officers from the quarantine posts To Sir c. Scott, xo. 182, July, 1st i 03 . that they now occupy in Kliorasan.*’ Lord Lansdowne further verbally informed Count Benckendorff that His Majesty’s Government would, in case tbe cordon were not withdrawn, station a British post in its immediate neighbourhood for the purpose of protecting British interests. A Consul, with a small escort, was subsequently despatched to Turbat-i-Haideri. Early in July disturbances directed against the Seistan Boundary Com mission took place at Nasratabad. These riots were instigated by the Russian Consul in Seistan, hut on strong remonstrances being made by Mr. Dobbs and supported at Tehran by His Majesty’s Minister, were suppressed by the Hasbmat- uLMulk. Owing to the riots which had taken place in various parts of Persia, His Majesty’s Minister suggested that a message should be conveyed to theprincipal Mujtelied of Nejef who was supposed to have instigated the dis turbances. The message was briefly to the following effect : — &lt;c The political interests of Great Britain and Persia are identical and the British Empire includes many millions of Mussulman subjects. Great Britain deprecates appeals to religious hatred as likely to do far more harm than good. Kot only Russia but Turkey and England have agreed to the new Persian tariff and it can only he altered by negotiations with those Powers. Let the Mujteheds therefore address to the bhah or Grand Vizier any complaints they mav have against the Persian Government and at the same time discourage the clergy from using language which may be misunderstood by the ignorant as an incitement to riot.’ 5 The above message was delivered to Agha Sharabiani of Nejef through His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad. In July a massacre of Babis occurred at Yezd and was probably instigated bv emissaries of Agha Nejefi of Isfahan. The local authorities seemed quite powerless to deal with the assailants of the Babis who obtained no redress. It is estimated that about 100 persons were killed in Yezd and in the neighbour ing district. On August 6th H is Majesty’s Minister reported that he had reason to believe that the Persian Government was being pressed by the Russian Legation to take the Gulf Quarantine arrangements out of the hands of the British Doctors and to place them under the control of the Belgian Custom House officials. Sir A. Hardinge was instructed on August 15th to make a strong protest against any alteration in the existing arrangements and to inform the Persian Government that any such change would bo looked upon by His Majesty’s Government as unfriendly and uncalled for. The Persian Government have not again reverted to the matter. Early in August Isfendiar Khan, Chief of the Bakhtiari tribe, died. On September 15th the Hakim ul-Mulk, who since the end of May had been Governor of Gilan, died suddenly at Jlesht not without grave suspicion of foul play. His death was quickly followed by the resignation of the Atabeg-i-Azam who had been Grand Vizier since 1897. His Highness immediately left Persia and proceeded via Moscow and Siberia, on a tour round the world. After the fall of the Atabeg, the Government of Persia was placed by the Shah in the hands of a Ministry presided over by the Aimed-Dowleh, Minister of the Interior, and of a Grand Council. The Ministers now appointed were each to be independent in their own departments and were to report direct to the Shah. Towards the close of October Sir A. Hardinge left Tehran to meet the Viceroy of India who was about to proceed on a visit to the Persian Gulf. The Persian Government were duly informed of Lord Curzon’s projected tour and the Ala-ed-Dowleh was instructed to receive His Excellency at Bushire on behalf of the Shah. Lord Curzon accompanied by Sir A. Hardino-e visited Muscat, Bunder Abbas, Bahrein and other places in the Persian ^Gulf. A programme had been arranged before His Majesty’s Minister left Tehran laying down the procedure to he observed on the occasion of the Viceroy’s visit to Bushire. This programme was subsequently altered at the request of the Persian Government. On the arrival of the Viceroy at Bushire difficulties arose in regard to the question of the visits to be exchanged with the Governor- Geneial of Ears. As no satisfactory arrangement could he arrived at, the Viceroy refused to land and returned to India. The incident at Bushire led * stm continuing—February 1904 . ^ &lt;r ^ loog correspondence with the Persian .. c .. Government who demanded an explana tion or the Viceroy s action. On November 1st His Majesty’s ChargS d’Affaires at Tehran informed Loid Lansdowne that the Peisian Government intended to remove the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, hereditary Governor of Seistan, after the withdrawal of the Seistan Boundary Commission Mr. Grant Duff was instructed to inform tho Persian Government verbally that His Majesty’s Government had recently gone to great expense to demarcate the boundary between Seistan and Afghan istan where Great Britain had preponderating interests, and that unless an 4)5 assurance were given by the Persian Government that the status quo in Seistan would be maintained, it would be difficult to withdraw Colonel McMahon’s Commission. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh stated that he could not give a message in the above sense to the Shah and Mr. Grant Duff was accord ingly instructed to address a formal note to the Persian Government to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had heard with great regret of the pro posal to remove the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, that they were deeply interested in the maintenance of peace and order in a district conterminous with British and Afghan territory and where the interests of Great Britain preponderated, and that they would regard with grave dissatisfaction so violent a disturbance of the existing status quo. The Persian Government replied by a somewhat discourteous note implying that the action which the Shah proposed to take as regards the Hashmat-ul-Mulk was no concern of His Majesty’s Government. A further communication was then addressed to the Persian Government to the effect that in view of the unfriendly character of the answer returned to the representation made by Mr. Grant Duff, His Majesty’s Government would feel it their duty to consider carefully what steps would become necessary for the protection of British interests in Seistan. Throughout the spring and summer of 1903 great obstacles had been placed in the way of the Seistan Boundary Commission by the local authorities, and much delay was caused by the indefinite orders sent by the Central Govern ment to the Persian Commissioner. InOctobertheYamin Nizam was instructed by the Persian Government to accept the modification of the Goldsmid line agreed upon between himself and the British Commissioner. This instruction was, however, made conditional to an engagement on the part of the Afghans to construct no dams on the upper Helmund from the Bund-i-Seistan to Bud- bar. This reservation again prevented progress being made and it was not till early in November that the Yamin Nizam was instructed to accept uncondi tionally the proposed modification of the Goldsmid line. Colonel McMahon finally gave his arbitral award on November 13th. During the past year treaties of friendship and commerce were concluded with Brazil (June 16th), Uruguay (May 19th), and Chile (March 30th). These treaties are similar in character to that concluded on May lith, 1902, with Mexico. A special Mexican Embassy under Monsieur de Mier (Mexican Minister at Paris) visited Tehran in November and remained a week. The negotiations which were proceeding at the Hague for the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and commerce between Persia and Japan are suspend ed for the present owing to the Russo-Japanese war.1 (Received informally from the Tehran Legation on 4 th Apj'il 1904 .) Roads in Persia in 1903. Russian concessions. 1 . Reribazar to Tehran vi&amp; Uesht .—This road is resrularly worked by a Russian Company. The section between Reskt and Sefid Ketele was during the autumn in a very bad state being for several weeks impassible for carriages or wagons. Travellers were obliged to ride and so deep was the mud in some places, especially after Kudum, that they had to leave the main road and ride through tracks made in the jungle. Large gangs of men have been working at the road and it is now better. Between Sefid Ketele and Kasvin the road is good. Onwards from Kasvin to the capital it is also in a fair condition. The rest-houses are rather better than formerly but are still dirty and the supplies obtainable indifferent and expensive. The road from Resht to Kasim (opposite Enzeli) has now been transferred from the Concessionaires (Salar Afkham and Nasr-es-Sultaneh) to the Road Company for a sum of 30,000 roubles. 2 Kosvin to Julfa via TWmz.—His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz has reported the arrival of Russian engineers at that town. Work will begin this spring, 1904 , both at Julfa and at Tabriz. The road has been surveyed as far as Zenjan. 3 . Kasvin to Hamdan .—This road has been surveyed but no work has yet been done. It is stated on fairly good authority that work will begin in the spring of 190 T as soon as the snow has melted. Persian Road Concessions. 1. Astara to Ardebil .—This road is being worked by the Persian Amoumia Company. 2 . Meshed to Askabad .—This road is worked partly by the Russians and partly by the Persians. It is stated to be in fairly good order. Persian Road Concessions still valid but not yet worked. 1 . Tehran to Caspian Sea via Chains. 2 . Tehran to Mazandaran.^lSo direction specified. 3 . The Shemran tramway. Road Concessions in which Great Britain is interested. 1. The Isfahan-Almaz Road known as the Bakhtiari road. This road has been travelled over during 1903 by Colonel Douglas, Major Burton and Mr. Parry, Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Ahwaz. Mr. Parry reports that the whole of the road from Alvanieh to Isfahan has fallen into a more or less bad state and requires thorough repairing, the worst places being as follows Jam Hill, Ala Khorshid, Malamir Hill, the descent from Kulleh Madressa to Dodsi-i-Balulak, Maulwari Hill, Osten-i-Polenj and one place between Dopolum and Ardel. The bridges, Mr. Parry states, are in good order but want repainting and some slight repairs. Mr. Parry is of opinion that the indifferent state of the road is owing to the Bakhtiari Khans having failed to carry out the terms of their agreement. Sir A. Hardinge, in a letter addressed to the Bakhtiari Khans early in November, referred to Mr. Parry’s complaints and advised them to repair the road at the points specified. The Chiefs state that this has now been done. Colonel Douglas is of opinion that the real, when he passed over it, was good as a mule track but in want of repair The Bakhtiari Khans asked that His Majesty’s Government should compeiMessrs. Lynch to build the caravanserais necessavy for the road, or else that two years’interest due on the £ 5 , 500 , sunk by Messrs. Lynch in the making of the road, should not he exacted from them. In placing the request of the Bakhtiari Khans before the Foreign Office, His Majesty s Minister suggested that if Messrs. Lynch did not agree to build the caravanserais or forego their interest, Government should pay it. Sir A. Hardinge was authorized to pay the Chiefs a sum not exceeding £700 with which to build the necessary caravan serais. New caravanserais have now been built between Kaleh lul and Ahwaz. The amount due bv the Khans to Messrs. Lynch on March 3 rd, 1901 , is about 12,122 tomans (£ 2 , 178 ) of which 5,000 tomans (£ 900 ) has been paid into the Bank at Isfahan and £700 remains to be paid by His Majesty s Legation. It has now been decided that these accounts connected with the road are to be settled in Persian currency. 2 . Tehran-Kum’Sultanabad Road .—During 1903 a scheme for taking over the concession granted to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the Persian Transport Company has been under discussion, the price asked by the Bank is £ 15,000 and £ 10,000 in shares of the Company, but up to the present no definite agreement has been arrived at. The section of the road from Tehran to Kum is in fair order, but the rest-houses are falling to ruin for want of proper maintenance. Mr. Charters, w'ho has been sent out by Messrs. Lynch to examine the various routes to the south, states that the river at Manzarieh is undermining the bridge at that place. From Kum to Sultanabad the road is not in good order. Near Kum the river is eating away the road. Along the Sultanabad plain the embankment has in many places been washed away by the rains and some of the culverts have been partially destroyed. There are one or two places on this section where no road has been made, this being specially noticeable between the villages of Shahwaran and Ibrahimabad.IW XI ^ (Beceived informally from the Tehran Legation on the 4th April 1904.) Persian Finances. No budget is published by tbo Persian Government and any figures given must be considered as approximate. The revenue of Persia is roughly £1,4125,000, and is made up as follows £ Customs, after deducting administration expenses ... 440,000 Maliat, or land tax ... ••• ••• 800,000 Posts and Telegraphs «*• ••• ... 15,000 Royalties on Caspian Fisheries • • • ••• ... 20,000 Passports ... ... • • •t 50,000 Mint, concessions and miscellaneous revenue 50,000 Crown domains t • • • t • ... 50,000 £ 1,425,000 The expenditure is about £ 1 , 650 , 800 , viz.:— Service of Debts—- £ The two Russian loans 1900-1902, the British loan of 1903 and the loan by the Imperial Bank, 1901 ... ... 216,000 Diplomatic and Consular service and Foreign Office ... 46,800 Shah and members of Kajar tribe ... ... 164,800 Cossack Brigade ... ... ... ... 43,200 Provincial administration, including part of the expenditure for the army ... ... ... ... 700,000 Army, not included in the above ... ... 300,000 Pensions ... ... ... ... ... 180,000 £ 1,650,800 Revenue Expenditure * £ 1,425,000 1,650,800 Deficit £ 225,800 The £ 216,000 paid for the service of the various loans is made up as follows:— Interest and sinking fund of [Russian Loans (£ 3 , 200 , 000 ) amounts to £ 176,000 ; £ 24,000 a year represents the interest on the advance made at 12 per cent, in April 1901 by the Imperial Bank of Persia. The remaining £ 16,000 represents the interest and sinking fund of the advance made in April 1903 by His Majesty’s Government. The expenses of the army are supposed to amount to £ 450 , 000 ; of this £ 160,000 is paid in the provinces from the Maliat. The deficit will be met— (1) By the increased revenue from the Customs. M. Naus hopes the revenue of his department will amount this year to at least £ 500 , 000 . (2) By a diminution of the expenses of the Court. ( 3 ) By a more satisfactory system in the collection of the Maliat which is to be introduced this year. Treasuries are to be established in all the provinces and a central treasury in Tehran. Every Gov ernor will be required to pay a fixed sum into the local treasury which will probably be managed by a Belgian official. This may to some extent prevent the peculation arising from the taxes passing through the hands of the Governor who having originally paid a high price for his post is obliged to recoup himself. °NOTES ON THE LEADING NOTABLES, OFFICIALS, MERCHANTS, AND CLERGY OF KHORASAN, SEISTAN, KAIN, AND KERMAN.A Abdul Husain, Haji, Tehrani —Son of Haji Agha Buzurg, is about 60 years of age, and one of the leading merchants of Meshed.

SECRET. “ \ External. To The Right Hon’ble LORD GEORGE E. HAMILTON, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, Mr Lord, Simla, the 21st September 1899. We desire to address Your Lordship and, through Your Lordship, Her Majesty’s Government on the subject of the relations of Great Britain with Persia. We might find an adequate reason for so doing in the fact that Your Lordship in your despatch of June 30th, 1899, enclosing a copy of a recent despatch to the Eoreign Office from Sir M. Durand, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, concerning the maintenance of our influence in Persia, has directly invited an expression of the views of the Government of India upon this matter; and, while calling our attention to the desirability of improv ing the Political and Consular Service in that country, has at the same time stated your desire to he made acquainted with our opinions upon the remaining questions discussed by Sir M. Durand. But, in any case, we should have felt it our duty at an early date to address Your Lordship on the subject. Although the relations of Great Britain with Persia have for a period of exactly a century occupied a large, and perhaps at times a disproportionate, space upon the field of international diplomacy ; although during that time Great Britain has twice broken off diplomatic relations and has once been at war with Persia in vindication of British interests in or upon the borders of that country; and, although large sums of money have been throughout the present century and are still annually expended in the maintenance of those interests, both by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India, we have not been able to discover in our records any clear definition of the principles upon which our policy towards the Persian kingdom is based, of the objects which it should keep in view, or of the scope and limits of the respective shares of responsibility, political and financial, which should be assumed by the two partners, viz., Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who are jointly concerned in the defence of Anglo-Indian interests in the dominions of the Shah. 2. We feel that there is at the present time the greater need for such a discussion, because of the facts, which must be patent to all, that the Persian Government appears well nigh to have exhausted all power of recuperation or reform; and that the country, but feebly held together by any tie either of race, religion, or loyalty, is only saved from a fate to which it must otherwise have long ago succumbed, partly by a superficial vitality not infrequently seen in political organisms, especially in the East, even when in an advanced stage of decay, still more by the rival ambitions of the two great European Powers between whom its territories are placed, and who are the real arbiters of its[ 2 ] destiny. These conditions have already displayed a durability in excess of any a 'priori expectations, and they may yet continue for a while, in the absence of any startling change of environment, to survive. But they cannot, in the nature of things, he permanent. A nation and a Government, such as the Persian, may tremble for long upon the verge of certain dissolution, irom the absence of the particular impulse that is required to propel them over the brink. But in the last resort, and often by accident, the impetus is com municated, and the already shattered structure tumbles into irretrievable ruin. 3 . We think that there are signs that such an issue, if not immediately impending in Persia, is drawing near. The rule of the present Shah is distinctly and uniformly weaker than that of his predecessor. Ihe dissolvent agencies at work in the Persian kingdom are more active and persistent. Meanwhile, the encroachments of B-ussian power are steadfastly pursued and are less veiled by any pretence of concealment. Other Governments and nationalities, either impelled by the secret obligations of international sympathies, or attracted by a desire to share in the probable spoils, are appearing upon the scene; and there is every reason to believe that, as in the case of the Ottoman Empire and of China, so also here, the property of the sick man, should no steps be taken in advance to prolong his existence, and should the end comp before any testamentary dispositions have been made, is likely to be subject of bitter contention between the various parties who may demand to be included among his heirs. 4 . We desire, therefore, not merely to examine, in response to Your Lordship’s invitation, the particular steps that may require to be taken for the maintenance or extension of British interests in Persia at the present juncture, but to survey a wider field, and, while there is yet time, to discuss how those interests should be definitely safeguarded in the future that seems to be imminent, and w r hat part in the outlay or in the measures that may be necessitated for that end, should be assumed respectively by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India. Sir M. Durand himself concludes his despatch by saying that “ the time has come for us to lay down a definite line of policy”. We concur in this opinion, but we interpret the obligation thus admitted in a broader sense than Her Majesty’s Minister has done ; and we think that no mere stop-gap measures, however useful they may individually be, will avail for the permanent protection of our position in Persia, unless a clear understanding be arrived at in advance as to what that position is and what it demands. 5. It may not be inappropriate to state, in the first place, what we conceive British, Anglo-Indian, interests in Persia to be. They are com mercial, political, strategical and telegraphic. The total annual value of British trade with Persia has been estimated by Sir M. Durand (and, from the calculations that we have made, we believe the estimate to be below the mark) as approximately three and-a-half millions sterling; and while a great deal of this trade, particularly in the south and east, is with British India, yet the northern and western avenues of entry are devoted in the main to commercial connections with the British Isles. The total volume of Anglo-Persian trade continues, in spite of the difficulties encountered and the increasing insecurity in Persia, to rise and, under a more efficient and less venal regime, would probably attain to much larger dimensions. Similarly, although the experience of the past decade has not been encouraging to British mercantile investment in Persia, as the experience of the Tobacco Begie, the Persian Mining Bights Company, and other ventures, has shown, there is nevertheless a good deal of British capital sunk in various industrial undertakings in different parts of the country. 6 . The political interests of Great Britain in Persia, although they date originally from a period before India had become a British interest at all, were, in the main Indian in inception, and are still largely Indian in character. It would be unfair, however, at the present day toattribute to them an exclusively Indian complexion. Ever since the first visit of the late Shah to Europe, Persia has been drawn increasingly into the vortex of European politics. Neither France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Holland, nor Belgium own possessions contiguous to the Persian dominions. r i heir commercial stake in the country is relatively small. Notwithstanding they find it to their interest to maintain, what are in some cases costly and extensive, diplomatic establishments at Tehran, and they occupy a minor, but nevertheless a definite, position upon the local diplomatic stage. It is to be surmised, therefore, that, even had British India not existed, or had it passed into other hands, the British Government would nevertheless before now have been compelled to take an active political interest in Persian fortunes. Persia is in fact one of^ those countries which, whether or not they had fallen into the orbit of A\ estern Powers, more vigorous than themselves, must inevitably have attracted the attention of Europe, partly from their increasing infirmity, but still more from the opportunities suggested by their latent, though neglected, sources of strength. The two-fold British interest and responsibility here indicated have indeed been recognised by the system, now of long standing, under which the charges of the diplomatic establishment maintained by Her Majesty’s Govern ment at Tehran are shared between the Imperial and the Indian Exchequers. That such a division of common interest has become necessary, that the politics of Tehran, which with one eye turned towards India looks with the other towards St. Petersburgh and Constantinople, are but one aspect of the eternal Eastern question, and that the control of British diplomacy at Tehran must therefore be vested in the hands of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, are propositions which 40 years ago were hotly contested by certain schools of thought, but that will not any longer be a matter of dispute. They serve to illustrate the Imperial, as distinct from the purely Indian, character of Anglo- Persian relations. 7. The strategical interests of Great Britain in Persia arise from conditions with which India is most intimately concerned. Long before the boundaries of British India had been extended to their present limits, or. before Ilussia had become a great Central Asian Power, approaching or impinging at many points upon the Indian frontiers, the fortunes of Persia, though not at that time a coterminous country, had become a matter of vital concern to the British dominion in India. In the early years of the present century, when the ambi tions of France were the main source of apprehension, it was through Persia that a blow at British supremacy was expected to be struck, and that an inva sion of India w T as planned. The same idea has re-appeared at intervals since. Now that the boundaries of Afghanistan, which have been demarcated and guaranteed by Great Britain, march for many hundreds of miles with those of Persia; that Persian territory is also coterminous for hundreds of miles with Baluchistan, a State under a British Protectorate, and in large measure actually administered by the officers of the Government of India;.and that the sea which washes the southern coasts of Persia is one in which, both from its proximity to the Indian Ocean and as a result of the exertions of the past century, Indian interests and influence have become supreme—it is clear that Persia has assumed a strategical importance, in relation to British India, which might not be serious, were the resources or the designs of that country itself alone to be considered; but which is indisputably great, when it is remembered that closely pressing upon Persia and upon Afghanistan is the ever-growing momentum of a Power whose interests in Asia are not always in accord with our own, and that the Persian Gulf is beginning to attract the interest of other and some times rival nations. These conditions, however,‘while they indicate the supreme concern -which those who are responsible for the government of India cannot fail to feel in the fortunes of Persia, are nevertheless sufficiently obvious m their general application to render it unnecessary for us to point out their far more than local range, or to argue that they affect not merely the destinies of British dominion in India, but those of the British Empire. It is from this point of view that we hold strongly the opinion that Persia in its strategical, no less than in its political, aspect is not only an Indian, but is also an Imperial, SZ5concern, and that we feel no hesitation in appealing to Her Majesty’s Government for a frank and generous recognition of this common responsibility. 8 . The telegraphic interests of Great Britain in Persia may he said to he evenly divided between the mother-country and India. lor whilst on the one hand the wires that have heen constructed between the north-west frontier and Tehran, and which provide the earlier link in the Persian section of the main overland connection with the East, are in the hands of a Company whose domicile is in London, from Tehran onwards to the Gulf the undertaking is conducted by an establishment that is recruited and paid for by the Govern ment of India, while its head-quarters are in the India Office in London. This two-fold system exists in order to maintain a connection which may be said to be equally British and Indian, since it is equally indispensable to the interests of both countries; but which also has an ulterior and wider scope, inasmuch as the Trans-Persian wires, and the sub-marine cables by which they are supplemented in the Persian Gulf, are largely utilised for the conveyance of messages between Great Britain and places lying beyond India, notably the Australasian Colonies. Prom a calculation based upon the aggregate results of the past five years, we have ascertained that no less than 30 per cent of the total traffic is of this description. Nevertheless the cost, in so far as it is borne by either Government, devolves exclusively upon the Indian, and not upon the Home, Exchequer. 9. Such are the main interests of Great Britain in Persia. It will be observed that the shares that may be claimed by the mother-country and by India in the sum total of those interests, have in the passage of time become so interwoven and fused as to render the task of separating or distinguishing them neither easy nor profitable. It may not be difficult, as we shall endeavour to argue later on, to distinguish between sources of expenditure which should more properly fall to the charge of the one or the other partner. But we maintain that enough has been said to prove that on the broad field of international policy Persia is not exclusively an Indian interest, but is emphatically an Imperial interest of Great Britain ; and that the latter should be prepared to exert her full strength for the defence of that interest, should it be jeopardised or impugned. 10 . In discussing the manner in which it is desirable that these principles, if accepted, should be carried into action, we are anxious at the outset to make our position, in one respect, perfectly clear. We have no desire to make an addition to the political or territorial responsibilities of India, for which we have not, under existing conditions, the means either in money or in men. We are not about to propose that there should be established any Protectorate, open or covert, over any part of the Shah’s dominions, that might compel us in the future to hold the country so protected by force of arms. We can conceive of circumstances that might some day tempt both the Indian and the Home Governments from this attitude of reserve, and that would in a case where the vital interests of the Empire were at stake, force us to consider a burden for which our shoulders are still unprepared. But for the present our ambitions are exclusively limited to making secure the interest which we have already built up, and still more to pie\ enting it from being undermined or taken from, us by others, with the result not only of a considerable accretion of strength to them, but of positive detriment to ourselves. We have, in fine, no desire to disturb the political stains quo in Persia so long as it can be maintained. We prefer indeed, weak as it is, to invest it with such renewed vitality as may be found possible. But we P re ss for an early decision and for early action, since, unless we bestir our selves, there is good reason for fearing that the already trembling balance may be disturbed by others to our disadvantage. . , nc ! w proceed to draw a picture of the present state of British m eres s m Persia, as they present themselves to our eyes, and to examine the dangers by which they appear to be threatened. Sir M. Durand has to a cer tain extent anticipated us m this task ; and in so far as he has touched upon e same ground as that which we propose to cover, we shall not recapitulateS 2 U [ 5 ] what he hns said. On the other hand, we think that we are in a position to fill in the outlines of his sketch with a good deal of additional detail; and it will be our duty to discuss the situation from the standpoint more particularly of those Indian interests, of which we are the constituted guardians. 12. The political destinies of a country and a Government, as weak as we have stated those of Persia to he, are likely to be determined in the main by her geographical position in relation to her neighbours. Of the four foreign Powers whose territories adjoin her own, two may he eliminated from the present discussion as being themselves lacking in the strength or vitality, likely to render their influence decisive, or their aggression to be feared. These are Turkey and Afghanistan, the latter of which, moreover, is under engagements with Great Britain that render it impossible for her to be considered, in her foreign relations, as an independent Power. There remain Russia and Great Britain. There is a curious correspondence, but there are also notable differ ences, between the positions of these two Powers vis a vis with Persia. The entire northern frontier of Persia is now contiguous with Russian territory, with the exception of that portion which borders upon the Caspian Sea—a distinction, but not a difference, inasmuch as that sea has to all intents and purposes been converted into a Russian lake. Russian territory also overlaps the north-east corner of the Persian dominions. Great Britain enjoys a some what similar preponderance of influence on the south, by virtue of her hitherto unchallenged supremacy, both naval and commercial, in the Persian Gulf; while, owing to recent developments on the side of Baluchistan, her land territories also touch those of Persia upon the south-east. But there are these broad differences between the two positions: firstly, that whereas the Russian territories that are limitrophe with Persia on the north are continuous either with those of European or with those of Asiatic Russia, the immense resources of both of which dominions can be brought by a skilfully designed system of railways, and deposited with little trouble and with no delay, upon the Persian frontier itself—the forces of Great Britain, if required for purposes either of menace or attack, would require to be conveyed by sea and would be separated by a great distance from their base; the land connection on the Perso-Baluch sfde being as yet too precarious and remote to admit of its being taken into serious consideration in the present context; secondly, that whereas the Russian land approaches upon the north are in her own exclusive possession, the maritime access of Great Britain on the south is equally open to any other Power possessing a naval marine. Hence the marked and inevitable distinction between the power of persuasion or menace possessed by Russia in the north, as compared with that at the disposal of Great Britain in the south, the advantage enjoyed by the former being enhanced by the fact that the Persian capital and Court are situated in the northern or Russian and not in the southern or British zone of influence. 13. In these circumstances it is not surprising to read of the increasing and indisputable supremacy which Russia has established in Northern Persia, as described by Sir M. Durand. While not repeating his demonstration, we may supplement it by saying that, while we think that no efforts should be spared to safeguard so much as is left to us of the trade that enters the country by the Trebizond-Tabriz route, of the trade of Tehran, and of that of North- East Persia (concerning which it may be noted that the imports into IVTcshed from British India which in 1893-94 represented a value of £198,500 and in 1894-95 of £312,000, have in 1897-98. sunk to £130,000), and while as long as the capital remains at Tehran, which is also the centre of important British interests in the shape of the Telegraph administration and the Imperial Bank of Persia, it is essential that British influence there. should be asserted on a scale as nearly as possible equivalent to that of Russia we are yet of opinion that the advantages enjoyed by Russia in the field under discussion are so over whelming as to render any attempt to dispute or to shake her position there fruitless; and that our own energies can with greater wisdom and with superior chances of success be directed towards the protection and consolidation of the[ 6 ] British sphere of influence in the centre and south. It is to a more critical examination of this subject that we now turn. 14. Sir M. Durand has in his despatch drawn a line across Persia from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier on the west, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Seistan and the Afghan frontier on the east, as indicating approximately the existing line of partition between the British and Kussian spheres of influence both political and commercial in Persia. 15. Following the same order from the west, we concur with what he has written about the importance of fostering the Baghdad trade route via Kerman shah to Tehran, British commerce by which approaches in value to £1,000,000 per annum. This is a route of peculiar value both to British and to Indian trade, and one upon which we should on no account forfeit the supremacy. We have no hesitation in recommending, with Sir M. Durand, the substitution of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah for the present native agent: although we think that the cost of the proposed appointment which lies outside of what may be called the more strictly Indian zone, and which will be subordinate to the Consulate-General at Tehran, should be borne by Imperial and not by Indian revenues. 16. Whatever be the prospects of opening up, either by road or by railway (and concerning the latter we are sceptical), the country that lies northward of the Karun River, and that is inhabited by the Lurs and other nomad tribes, it is certain that British influence has obtained a material foothold in that corner of the Shah’s dominions, through which the Karun flows in its middle and lower course, and where the road now being constructed through the Bakhtiari country, by contract between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and Messrs. Lynch, should open an alternative and almost exclusively British door of commercial access to Ispahan. We do not express any opinion as to the ideas which Sir M. Durand has more than once put forward as to the desirability of raising a local irregular force under British officers from the tribes in this part of Persia. Such a scheme would appear to postulate a firmer and more permanent footing than we have as yet established in South-West Persia. Nevertheless we think that no opportunity should be lost of strengthening our influence with the Arab, Bakhtiari and Lur tribes—an effort to challenge which from a rival quarter appears likely before long to be made—and we concur in Sir M. Durand’s recommendations as to the desirability of establishing a Consulate on the Karun, reserving for a subsequent paragraph our opinion as to the proper incidence of the cost. 1 1 17. Continuing in an easterly direction, we have noticed from the recent Consular Report of Mr J. R. Precce, Her Majesty’s Consul at Ispahan, that British trade in Ispahan has shown during the last two years, if not an absolute decrease, at all events no expansion whatever ”, while great strides have been made m Russian importations, notably of glassware and hardware. We agree with Sir M Durand in thinking that the British Consul should be raised m respect of title and pay to the same level as the recently arrived ussian representative, although, as this is a matter which mainly concerns he English I oreign Office, we are not clear that we are called upon to advise Z°t n in ]e ri : ^^ver, too strongly emphasise our opinion that in any partition either of commercial or political spheres of influence in eisia, Ispahan, the old (and, if Persia should ultimately break up, possibly a Persia amW nf 16 ^ if the S ® favi ^asty, the principal market o? Central Iersia, and (far moie than lehran) the focus of Persian nationalitv must supreme^ ^ in the Z0 * e * 18. .Me also concur with Sir M. Durand in thinking that British interests are most inadequately represented at Shiraz by the present native n«rent ^ hn is a nonentity, without influence or power; and that the experiment of brinow the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who is also Consul-General for Ears, to Se[ 7 ] during the summer at the capital of the province, which is within his official area of jurisdiction, should be given a further trial. Colonel Wilson in 1895 and Colonel Meade in 1898 spent the summer months at Shiraz, but were compelled to hire house accommodation at their own expense. If these visits are made recurrent, we are inclined to think that, as no suitable house appears to he open either to purchase or to rent, a site should be purchased and a house erected thereon. To this suggestion also we will revert. Shiraz is a place of considerable importance; and were it not for the great influence that has for long been exercised there by the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, British interests must have suffered from the neglect to which they have hitherto been exposed. 19. The districts lying to the east of Ispahan and Shiraz contain the important cities and trade-centres of Yezd and Kerman, connected by one of the principal postal and caravan tracks of Persia. Both of these towns and districts lie south of the natural line of division between Northern and Southern Persia; and in both British commercial and political influence has, in recent years, been actively vindicated. In September 1893, Mr. Eergusson, the Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank, was appointed unpaid Vice- Consul at Yezd. Sir M. Durand now suggests that a Vice-Consul, if appointed to Bunder Abbas, might pass his summer at Yezd, where it is no doubt intrinsi cally desirable that British commercial interests should be represented by some one not engaged in business or trade. We will for the moment reserve our comments upon this suggestion. At Kerman, which is the capital of an important province, and the seat of a Governor-General, the appointment of a British Consul, which was first sanctionel under exceptional circumstances in the case of Captain Sykes in 1891, has at frequent intervals since, the latest being our despatch of August 10th, 1898, been the subject of discussion between Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. The present position is this, that for 5 years the Government of India have expressed their willingness to contribute one-half of the cost of the Kerman Consulate up to a limit of Bs 6,000 per annum.# The views of the Foreign Office upon this proposal, which was communicated to it by Your Lordship on September 21st, 1898, have not yet been received by us. Sir M. Durand now proposes that this Consulate should be made permanent, and that possibly a native agent under its orders should be sent to Bampur. Before discussing these pro posals, we think it advisable to analyse the larger issues raised by the questions of Seistan and the Persian Gulf. 29. Concerning Seistan, its importance and the present position there, we refer Your Lordship to a Minute which has been written by the Viceroy, who has made a special study of the question, and which is enclosed with this despatch. The facts enumerated by him are, we think, sufficient to show that Seistan is, by reason of its geographical position in relation both to North Khorasan, to Western Afghanistan, to British Baluchistan, and to the Persian Gulf, a position of no small strategical importance. Seistan is the present meeting point of the advanced pioneers of British and Russian influence. Perhaps on the whole, owing to recent activity on our pait, the British position and chances are the more hopeful. It is essential in the future, for reasons which have been argued in the Viceroy’s Minute, that Seistan should be retained in the British zone. It is fortunately not too late to secure that consummation. The steps which should be taken with that object will be examined when we formulate our final recommendations at the close of this despatch. 21. South of Seistan lies the still imperfectly known district of Persian Baluchistan. Every year this province is being brought into closer contact with British associations, partly from the visits of British officers, partly from the wide-spreading influence exercised by the Nushki-Seistan Trade route, still more from the close connections, political and racial, prevailing between the inhabitants of the two sides of the Perso-Baluch border—a condition of affairs which is likely to be confirmed by the inevitable increase of British influence in the dominions of the Khan of Kalat.[ 8 ] 22, Onr inspection of tlie various sub-areas composing what we have described as the British sphere, has now brought us to the Persian Gulf—a subject which—no doubt from its more exclusively Indian aspect and bearing-^ has only been lightly touched upon by Sir M. Durand, but upon which it is necessary that we should address Your Lordship at greater length. 23. The de jure position in the Persian Gulf is that of a sea open to the flag of all nations, the northern shores and territorial waters of which are included in the dominions of Persia, while its western and southern coasts are partially owned and partially claimed by Turkey, or are in the occupation of Arab tribes, who have entered into treaty relationships of varying character, constituting a sort of veiled Protectorate, with Great Britain. The islands in the Gulf are owned either by Persia, or by Arab Chiefs (in the case of Bahrein under British protection ; but upon one of the Persian Islands, viz., Kishm, Great Britain pos sesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Maskat, to whom the island once belonged. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included in the same political system, are, on the northern shore of the Arabian Sea, the coasts of Persian Baluchistan, along which the overland wires of the Indo-Europe m Telegraph Company run as far as Jask, where a reserve of English territory exists under an agreement concluded in 1887 between the British and Persian Governments, and where a detachment of Indian troops, who had previously been stationed there between the years 1879 and 1887 , was replaced in January 1898 in consequence of the murder of a British telegraph official and the disturbed state of Persian Baluchistan. A larger detachment was at the same time despatched to Charbar, near the eastern limits of the same province. On the southern and western coasts is the still independent kingdom or Sultanate of Oman (Maskat). 21 . The de jacto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraph might indicate. In the early years of the present century, the slave trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine uere engaged in a long and arduous struggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts. This conflict which was conducted entirely by British agenev and means, without any help from the Persian Government, resulted in the establish ment of treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which they bound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Britannic a, which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrange ments and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar origin were the soundings of the channels and the surveys of the shores of the Persian Gulf, which the navigators of all nations owe to the labours of a long line of naval officers of the Indian service. Meanwhile, British trade has acquired almost a monopoly of the foreign commerce of the Gulf ports. Indian Bunias from Shikaipur and other parts of Sind have settled in considerable numbers at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire and Bahrein. Thev frequently farm the customs. The foreign imports and exports pass through their hands. These arc for the most part conveyed to and from the Gulf in British ships, more than one Angio-Luhan Company (the ‘ British India’, the ‘ Bombay and Persia’, and the Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf’) having maintained for years a merchant steamer service between Karachi and Basrah, touching at the Gulf ports on the wav, whilst the rival ventures that have occasionally been attempted by foreign nations have uniformly failed and have been withdrawn. ? f cal ' e f ul 1 calculations of the trade returns of the three fhe +nfn1 9 v„ 9 1 6 ,'» J 7 ’f W T 1Ch T ‘ ?) est at our dls P osal &gt;' ve have ascertained that the total value of Imports and Exports in the Persian Gulf (including the Persian ports of Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Buslnre, and Mohammerah ; the Arab Il 7 C C ° a f *¥ trie “ ial P^od amounted to for f:', 191 . (i/hi in 1 V? ?’* ''i f 1 )’ ^ rids total, Local trade accounted for £o 124,000, and External trade for £12,117,300; while of the latter total the trade with Butish possessions (including India) amounted to £9,709,500,\ t 9 ] or over 80 per cent of the entire External trade. In the same three years, out of a total of 2,161 steamers which entered and cleared from the Gulf ports, 2,039 were British, and their tonnage represented 84 per cent of the total tonnage. If the returns of Persian ports alone be required, the figures are Total trade, £11,172,000, of which Local trade = £2,169,400 and External trade — £9,002,600, the British proportion of the latter being £7,494,200, or 83 per cent. To these totals in cither case there should, in our opinion^ certainly be added those of Basrah, which amounted in the same triennial period to £2,157,300. Unfortunately the manner in which these have been prepared, do not admit of our distinguishing the countries of origin or destination. The pro portion, however, that should properly he assigned to Anglo-Indian commerce may he inferred from the British percentage of shipping, that entered or cleared from that port in the three years referred to. It amounted to no less than 93 per cent both of the number and tonnage of the steamers engaged. 26. During the last thirty years the maintenance of the sub-marine cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Company from Eao to Jask, and of the land lines from that place to Karachi, has also devolved upon the Indian Government, and has tended to increase an already preponderant influence over both the waters and the shores of this sea. Latterly there has been a deliberate but necessary con solidation of our influence in certain quarters where trouble threatened or where rivalry was feared. At the north-west extremity of the Gulf, we have, under instructions from Her Majesty’s Government, entered into engagements with the still independent Sheikh of Koweit, by which he has bound himself and his successors not to receive the representative of any other Power and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other p ower — a proceeding which was dictated by the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority and by the incipient intrigues of other Powers. Similar machinations are known to be in progress at Bahrein, and will require to he counteracted by a more strict enforcement of the conditions to which the Sheikh is by treaty bound. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included within the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Maskat has for years been controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo- Indian hands; and its ruler has not merely for years been subsidised by the Government of India, but in 1891 entered into an Agreement with us, under the orders of Her Majesty’s Government, not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. 27. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication we have more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838 to 1842, and again in 1856-57. Bushire was held during the latter years, as also were Mohammerah and Ahwaz upon the Karun. The occupation of these places was an illustration of the vigour with which in past years our ascendency has been maintained. Their abandonment was a proof of the reluctance which has invariably been displayed to emphasise or to perpetuate these responsibilities. The latter, however, no less than the British position in Southern Persia in general, are now threatened by an external competition, to the evidences of which we next turn. 28. Sir M. Durand has in general terms described the commanding posi tion which the proximity of the Trans-Caspian Railway and of her Central Asian garrisons, the construction of the Ashkabad-Kuchan-Meshed cart-road, and the annual expenditure of large sums of money, have enabled Itussia to take up in the politics and commerce of the province of Khorasan. We proceed to develop the argument by showing how the Khorasan position has been and is bein°' utilised as the base of a further and more southerly advance. 29. It was in 1889 that the campaign of what may he termed the Russi fication of Khorasan was opened with the appointment of a Russian Consul- General at Meshed. In 1891 a native trader, named Haji Agha, appeared as[ 10 ] Russian News-agent at Birjand; and an emissary of bad character, named Muhammad Rahim Khan, who had already been dismissed from the Russian service, was again taken into employ, and was posted as News-agent at Nasira- had in Seistan. In the succeeding years Russian Armenians, trained at Tiflis, were busily at work surveying the country in a southerly direction, as far as the borders of Persia and Baluchistan. In 1895 a more direct blow at the large Anglo-Indian trade which at that time still made its way through Khorasan into the Russian possessions in Central Asia, was struck by the introduction of a Customs Tariff in Trans-Caspia, absolutely prohibiting the entry into the Russian territories of all British or Indian products except indigo, tea and muslin, and these only under a heavy duty. In the same year M. Zaroudny, a Russian politico-geologist, Anglice surveyor, paid his first visit to Kain and Seistan. Russian N ews-agents were also placed at Tabbas and Neh, as well as at Birjand and Nasirabad. 30. In the meantime, in the latter part of 1896, the Government of India had decided upon taking active measures to open the long closed trading route from Quetta to Seistan. These intentions, and the prospective British interest in Seistan to which they testified, excited much concern in Russia; and in the following year the outbreak of plague in India offered to the Russian authorities a welcome opportunity of, at the same time, endeavouring to strangle the new enterprise at its birth, and increasing their own influence in Seistan. Under the pretext of establishing a protective cordon to safeguard the Perso-Afghan frontier in Persian interests from a disease which existed neither in Baluchistan nor in Afghanistan, Russian Cossacks under Russian officers were planted at a number of places in Persian territory, where they turned back every caravan (ignoring an agreement that had been arrived at between Great Britain and Persia for a 10 days quarantine upon caravans arriving from infected countries), declined to accept any orders except those which came directly from the Russian Legation, and for a time absolutely closed the Herat-Meshed road, in spite of orders to the contrary from the Persian Government—the object of this measure being to divert Afghan trade from Meshed to Panjdeh and Merv in Russian territory. It was significant that upon crossing the Russian frontier the caravans, which had been refused passage through Persia under any condi tions, were only detained for three days in quarantine. The Persian Govern ment, after a feeble protest, acquiesced in these proceedings; and it may almost be said that Southern Khorasan passed for a time under Russian control. 31. It was with the object of anticipating a similar Russian intervention in Seistan that, in the spring of 1897, the Government of India despatched Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh to superintend any preventive measures that might be required in that district. Already Lieutenant Webb Ware, who had visited Seistan in March, in connection with the trade route, had reported : “ I was disagreeably astonished to find what ascendency Russia had gained through out Seistan ”. Major Brazier-Creagh, a few months later, w T rote : “I was by no means surprised to find what ascendency the Russians had gained in the country. In the past four years Russian activity has been very manifest. It is not limited to Seistan, but extends all along the Perso-Afghan frontier up to Meshed, News-writers and agents being established at all the important trade centres, viz., Neh, Birjand, Tabbas, Khaf, and Turbat-i-Haidari 32.. The recommendations made by the British officer were ignored by the Persian authorities, and he had not been long in Seistan when the expected Russian doctor (Miladchevsky by name), with an escort of eight Cossacks, appeared upon the scene, a detachment of ten Cossacks under a Russian officer being also posted at Turbat-i-Haidari, 80 miles south of Meshed, a point ot junction of several caravan roads, so as effectually to stop any traffic to or Horn Seistan. An incidental result of Hr. Miladchevsky’s visit to* Seistan was the dismissal, in consequence of a report from him, of the two native Russian agents to whom reference has been made, and their replacement by t e Pe! sian sub-contractors for customs for Kain and Seistan. These indivi duals proved to be equally faithless to the interests of their employers, and were3 ,^? 321 [ n ] relieved of the representation of Russian interests in April of the present year. It was then announced that a Russian, named Ziedler, had been appointed Russian Consul in Seistan—an announcement which was imme diately followed by the despatch of Captain Sykes, hitherto British Consul at Kerman, to Seistan in a similar capacity. The Russian Consul would appear not yet to have taken up his post; and the Russian authorities are believed to he waiting to see the next move of Her Majesty’s Government before deciding upon their own action. 33 . Meanwhile in 1898, M. Zaroudny re-appeared upon the scene of his former labours, and on the present occasion pushed his politico-scientific studies as far south as Persian Baluchistan and Bampur. Early in the present year the Agent to the Governor-General at Meshed reported that two Russian officers, 1 doctor and 10 Cossacks were still at Turbat-i-Haidari, and 1 Russian Officer, 2 Medical Assistants and 10 Cossacks at Karez. There are also 58 Persian sowars scattered about at different places between Meshed and Seistan, who are paid through the Russian officers and take their orders from them. The recrudescence of plague in India has in fact provided an excuseior the continuance, just as its original appearance was pleaded in support of the in troduction, of a quasi-Wussmn Protectorate in Southern Khorasan. A more active assertion of the same pretensions has since been witnessed in the mission of M. Stroeff, Dragoman to the Russian Consulate at Meshed, with presents valued at £1,400, to the Persian Governor of Kain, who is brother to the Governor of Seistan and is believed to covet the succession to that post. The sanitary plea was also advanced in the course of the past summer to explain the despatch of Russian doctors to Kerman and even to Shiraz. An interesting commentary upon these proceedings may be found in an observation in Lieutenant Webb Ware’s report upon the Quetta-Seistan trade route for 1897-88, where he says that “ the chief hindrance to the further development of this route is to he found in the obstructive measures taken by the Russian officers striving to further the interests of that country at the expense of India”. 34 . The facts which w r e have enumerated will, we think, be sufficient to convince Your Lordship of two propositions : firstly, that Russia regards with unconcealed aversion the opening of the British commercial route from India to Seistan and Khorasan, and will spare no efforts to rob it of success; secondlv, that she regards with an interested eye the future of Seistan itself, and is already preparing, by a display of armed force and by the assumption of executive authority, to pave the way for an eventual inclusion within the Russian sphere of that portion of the Shah’s dominions. 35 . In tbe same context, and as illustrating the political and strategical object which such an advance may be believed to have in view, it will not be forgotten that during the past few years, the Russian Government have constructed a railway from Merv to Kushk upon the Afghan frontier wdthin 80 miles of Herat, and have stacked at the terminus the railway plant for a future extension to Herat itself. Should any doubt be entertained as to the purpose for which this extension (which is destitute of any commercial justifi cation) was planned, it may be solved by a reference to the frank admission made to Sir N. O’Conor by M. deWitte, Russian Minister of Finance, in June 1898 , that it was designed “ to enable Russia to attack Afghanistan in case of complications with England ”. When it is remembered that such an attack can only be made in direct violation of solemn international engagements, it is not, we think, incumbent upon us to argue at further length that the political ambitions of Russia in Eastern Persia, and in close proximity to the Afghan border, have an ulterior significance which it would be folly to ignore. 36. Nor can we divorce these proceedings from the idea that, in seeking to obtain a preferential footing in Seistan, Russia is not merely endeavouring to block a promising avenue of Anglo-Indian trade, and to acquire a position of potential menace to British interests on the western flank of Afghanistan, but that she is also concerned in the prosecution of an advance, which is not expected to terminate until it has brought her to the Persian Gulf. It is known[ 12 ] that at least on one occasion negotiations for the cession to Russia of a Persian port at the eastern extremity of the Gulf have taken place between the Russian and the Persian Governments; and, if such negotiations have hitherto either proved abortive, or have been nominally repudiated by one 01 other of the parties concerned, it is yet, we think, in our power to show that they are not only not inconsistent with, but are definitely corroborated by, the eMdences of Russian activity in Central and Southern Persia to which ue now turn. 37. In 1897, a Russian Consul was appointed for the first time to Ispahan, where Russian imports had not hitherto greatly exceeded a total of oOO bales per annum. He was given a salary and title in excess of those enjoyed by the British representative. During the present *year this official, Prince Dabiya, has been heard of at Shiraz'and Bushire as the guest of the French Vice- Consul, and subsequently at Mohammerah and Shushter on the Karun, where he freely denounced British methods and ambitions. Sir M. Durand has recently informed us by telegraph that the corps of so-called Persian Cossacks at Tehran (i.e., Persian soldiers trained and commanded by Russian officers) has been raised from 1,000 to 1,500 men, and that detachments of this corps have for the first time been taken with them to the south by the Governors of Shiraz and Arabistan. For the present the Russian officers have stayed behind; but it is not difficult to imagine the circumstances in which they might claim to rejoin their regiments. In 1897, M. Krugelow was sent from Jerusalem as Russian Consul to Baghdad, with the special object of reporting upon the acquisition by Russia of a coaling station in the Persian Gulf. This gentleman has taken much interest in Koweit, where Russian emissaries from Baghdad have been residing continuously during the present year. In this context it will not be forgotten that the concession recently sought for with the aid of the Russian Embassy at Constantinople by Count Kapnist, a Russian of high rank, for a railway from Tripoli in Syria to the Persian Gulf contemplated a terminus at Koweit. 38. In Bushire and Bunder Abbas the Russians have lately developed a marked interest. Two Russian doctors (Drs. Marc and Oust) arrived at Bushire in 1897 for the now familiar purpose of studying the plague, which, however, did not make its appearance until two years later, in 1899. Dr. Marc in 1897 occupied his waiting hours in visiting Bunder Abbas, from whence he was in the habit of despatching official reports to his Government., and where he magnanimously treated all patients free of charge. His medical pursuits at this place were assisted by a third Russian, named Adamoff, who appears to have been an artillery officer, and who subsequently visited Bushire and Basrah. In 1898 two other Russian doctors, named Rodzewitz and Kornajevski, appeared upon the scene, and visited Basrah, Bushire and Bunder Abbas. In December 1898 a fifth Russian doctor, named Paschkowski, arrived in the Gulf, and did not fail to pay the regulation visit to Bunder Abbas; while he displayed a considerable professional activity during the recent outbreak of plague at Bushire, where he has announced that, upon his approaching return to Russia, he is to be replaced by two compatriots. In connection with this medical propaganda, it will be in Your Lordship’s recollection that when the first rumours were circulated of plague at Bushire in the past summer, the Russian Legation at Tehran at once announced their intention of sending doctors, with Cossack escorts, to Bushire as well as Shiraz, in order to establish a plague cordon for the protection of those places from the Indian pestilence, and that Russian doctors took up their quarters both at Shiraz and Kerman. These precautions midit be thought to indicate a praiseworthy desire to close every conceivable channel of entry into Asiatic Russia against the plague, v\ere they not, as has already been shown, in striking contrast with the laxity of system, that is at the same time observed both on the Porso-Russian and on the Russo-Afghan frontiers, across which alone can plague succeed in entering the Russian dominions. In continuation of our storv it may be mentioned that in 1895 a Russian officer visited and surveyed the island of Hormuz opposite to Lunder Abbas, and that other and non-medical Russian emissaries[ 13 ] have also recently been heard of at the latter place (the two latest, M. Babit- chieff and Baron de Schedenore, as lately as August in the present year). It should not, moreover, be forgotten that it was Eussian opposition that in 1898 broke down the loan to the Persian Government from the Imperial Bank of Persia, the security of which was to be the customs of the southern ports, to be collected by agents of the Bank. 39 . We are aware that on April 18th of the present year, with reference to reports that have been published of Russian designs upon the island of Kishm, adjoinin'*- Hormuz, Count Mouravieff assured Sir C. Scott, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!!, that “there was absolutely no intention on the part of the Russian Government to*add to the burden of their existing respon sibilities bv acquiring outlying ports or stations which would require naval defence in time of war” ; and we do not doubt that this emphatic assurance represents the views sincerely entertained by the Emperor of Russia. But our faith in the value of this assurance has been somewhat shaken by the later information received from a Persian ollicial of high rank and station, known personally to the Viceroy, to the effect that he believes Russia to have acquired certain rights in regard' to a port in the Persian Gulf, which however it may not suit her at once to enforce. Moreover there is in practice a limit to the duration of all such pledges, which, even if given by the sovereign, are not always regarded as binding by his officials; and previous experience is not altogether 3 encouraging to the belief in a prolonged existence of the present undertaking, should circumstances compel an opposite course. There are more over other means, well-known to Her Majesty’s Government from recent experience in other parts of the world, of obtaining political and territorial influence, independently of the actual acquisition of harbours or stations. 40 It is in our opinion, more than a coincidence that simultaneously with the increasing Russian interest in Central and Southern Persia which we have described, there should also have been a notable revival of French activity in those quarters. In 1890 the Messageries Maritimes Company commenced a subsidised service from Bombay to the ports of the Persian Gulf; although, owin^ to vessels of unsuitable draught having been employed, the enterprise was not a success and was shortly abandoned. In 1897 a Trench Vice-Consul (M Eerrand) was for the first time appointed at Bushire, although the value ot French trade with the Persian Gulf in that year amounted only to the modest total of £82,618 (of which £73,899 was sugar). He was succeeded m 1893 by M. Bryois. who recently informed the agent of one of the British Trading Companies at Bushire that the French Government intended shortly to establish a subsidised line of steamers to Mohammerah and the Karim. It was perhaps m connection with this project that in March 1899, M. Bryois paid a visit to theKarun, where a French scientific party, under M. de Morgan, has for some time been engaged in politico-archaeological researches in Arabistan. A\ hen the Trench Charge d’Affaires, Comte d’Arlot, recently visited Ispahan, the Zil-es-Sultan vouch safed the corroborative information to the British Legation that the object of these movements on the part of the French was to obtain a footing at Mohammerah, Shushter and Dizful. During our recent negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit about the future of that harbour, it was with some surprise that we learned from him that the French had already approached him on the subject. In Bahrein a so-called French merchant, M. Goguyer, who until recently was engaged m Maskat in an attempt to revive the traffic m arms under the French flag, has been reported as endeavouring to induce the inhabitants to purchase Frenc i pro ec- tion bv the payment of small sums. In 1899 a French Consular Agency was established at Lingah, where the same ingenious system ot manufacturing French subjects (for the most successful illustration of which we must look to Siam) was started, and where the French flag was hoisted by the Dragoman of the French Vice-Consul at Bushire. Finally, Her Majesty’s Government are better aware than ourselves of the recent negotiations tor a Trench loan to the Persian Government upon the security of the customs of the Gult ports, and a promise of a railway monopoly in that country.[ 14 ] 41 French, interests in the Persian Gulf, either political or commercial, are so small ; her own territories are so distant; and the Gulf lies so far out of 6 the track of — 'le e and e annoyan C e to^ possible rival, and to lend an independent assistance to the plans of a European ally. Substantial confirmation of these views will in our opinion, be derived from a study of recent French action at Maskat where although French trade is infinitesimal, and a French man-of- wa r ha^ been’in the habit of paying a passing visit on an average only once to the year, the French Government have nevertheless during the past six months been endeavouring to obtain, under the guise of coaling facilities a position which would provide them with an independent pied a terre m he neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. This policy has been foreshadowed by the free grant of the French flag to Arab dhows, owning allegiance to the Sultan of M iskat, and is facilitated by the influence over the latter petty potentate that has been acquired by the French Vice-Consul, whose anti-Bntish inclina tions and intrigues are so well known to Her Majesty s Government as to require no recapitulation here. Confirmation of our suspicions regarding a Fmneo-Russian entente in Persia and in the Persian Gulf is fuither affoided by a telegram, dated June 7 th, 1899, from Sir M. Durand to Colonel Meade, which has alreadv been communicated both to Your Lordship and to the Foreton Office, and to which Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran remarks : “ You may be quite certain that Russia and France are working in unison . 42. It should be noted that in the recent papers, with copies of which we have been favoured by Her Majesty’s Government, we have found a repudiation of French ambitions in the quarter under discussion, no less explicit than that -which we have already quoted from the lips of Count Mouraviefl*. On July 19th, 1899, M. Cambon said to Lord Salisbury that “1 ranee had no political aspiration whatever in the Persian Gulf ; that she did not desire any kind of fortification or settlement or political privileges, or anything beyond the maintenance of those rights already insured to her by treaty . VI e ha\e been gratified to read this assurance, by which we hope that succeeding French ministries may hold themselves bound. Rut we regret that it has not been communicated, not merely to Her Majesty’s Government, but also to the French Agents in those regions, wdio do not appear to be equally acquainted with the views of the Government that they serve. 43. In recent years Germany has begun to display a positive and an increasing interest in Persia and also in the Persian Gulf. This interest has been the historical, and perhaps the natural, sequel of a commercial policy that has for some time aimed at securing the control of the principal railways in the Turkish dominions in Asia Minor, and of a political ambition, that more recently still, would appear to aim at the protection of the Ottoman Empire, alike in Europe and Asia. The obvious corollary to a system of German railways in Asia Minor, would be similar railroads to the Persian border and through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf. Already, as Sir M. Durand has in formed the Foreign Office, the Germans have procured a concession for the construction of a road from Khanikin, on the Turko-Persian frontier, to Tehran, and have apparently only abstained from pressing for a railroad in the same quarter, because of the violent opposition with which the Russian Minister met the proposal at Tehran. The second son of the Shah, Prince Malik Mansur, has been spending several months in 1898-99 in Germany, wTiere his education and proclivities are reported as having acquired a marked philo-Teutonic tinge. German military instructors have been proffered for the reorganisation of the Persian army. Prolongations of the Turko-German railways to Baghdad and to the Persian Gulf have been and are still being freely discussed; and the German Government are endeavouring to procure an interest in the overland Turkish Telegraph to Fao. In the Gulf itself a German Consulate w 7 as established in 1897 at Bushire, to safeguard the interests of six German subjects in the entire ports of that sea. A Bremen firm opened business at Bushire, but the specially chartered steamers which were sent out from Germany appear to have been afailure. At Basrah a more resolute attempt is being made to capture the local market. Quite recently a number of Germans have for some time been engaged in a study of the situation at Bunder Abbas. During the spring of the present year, a German man-of-war, the “ Arcona”, visited Maskat, Lingah, and Bushire; and reports have reached us of the likely appearance, at no distant date, of a German line of merchant steamers in the Gulf. 44 . While we regard these symptoms of increasing German interest in the Persian Gulf as emphasising the international aspect which the Persian question appears more and more destined to assume, and therefore as adding to the complexities of an already sufficiently difficult situation, we do not question the bond fide commercial enterprise which is carrying German trade there, as to so many other open seas and ports in the world, and we can conceive that we may even find, in the existence of German political interests, an occasional ally or safeguard for our own. German interests, however, have a tendency to grow with some rapidity, and by steps which are not always acceptable to their neighbours: and we think that the need for an early decision upon the future policy to be adopted by Her Majesty’s Government is not diminished, but is enhanced, by the appearance of so active a competitor upon the scene. 45. Apart from the recurrent symptoms of activity on the southern and western shores of the Persian Gulf, with which Her Majesty’s Government are familiar, the Turkish Government have also in recent years displayed an increas ing interest in its political fortunes. A determined attempt has been made to fortify the shadowy pretensions of the Ottoman Porte to suzerainty over Koweit. A Turkish title has been conferred upon the Sheikh; and forces have more than once been assembled at Basrah for a contemplated expedition against that place. Intrigues are constantly in progress at Bahrein. During 1898 and 1899 a Turkish corvette has been a frequent visitor at Lingah, where, the Sheikh being of Arab descent, Turkish interests are supposed to exist. Pinally, the decisions of the Venice Conference and the proceedings of the Sanitary Board at Constantinople have enabled Turkey to claim an interest in the navigation of those waters, of which she has not been slow to take advantage. 46. The only other recent evidences of foreign intervention in the Persian Gulf, of which we are cognisant, are a concession for the pearl-fisheries in that sea, which was given in 1898 by the Persian Government to a Spaniard and a Belgian, under Bussian auspices; and the contemplated, appearance at the Gulf ports of customs officers of Belgian nationality, similar to those who have already been placed in charge of the customs houses at Kermanshah and Tabriz, and whose influence, said to be omnipotent at the present moment with the Sadr Azam, is known to be entirely enlisted on the side of Prance and Itussia. 47. We have gathered together these symptoms of external, and notably of Russian or of Russophil, interest in Southern Persia and in the Persian Gulf, not because we desire to invest them individually with an importance to which they are not entitled, but because collectively they indicate, in a manner that is not open to misinterpretation, the policy and ambitions of foreign Powers, and because we desire to impress upon Her Majesty’s Government the fact that in an area, by land and by sea, which Great Britain regards with good reason as falling within her sphere, of influence, that influence is being directly and increasingly challenged by other nations, who, in proportion as their foothold becomes more securely established, will resist any preferential claims, upon what ever foundation in history or in fact they may rest, and will claim for themselves an equality of right which in theory it may be difficult to contest. 48. More particularly do these considerations apply to the case of Russia, whose advance across the deserts that form a natural barrier of division between Northern and Southern Persia, cannot be regarded with anything but uneasiness by the Government of India, and the appearance of whose flag in the Persian Gulf would import a novel element of unrest into a situation that is at no time without its anxious features. We desire deliberately to say to1 J [ 16 Your Lordship, with a full consciousness of our responsibility in so saying that difficult as we find it in existing circumstances to meet the financial and military strain imposed upon us by the ever increasing pioximity o tussian power upon the northern and north-western frontiers of India from the 1 amirs to Herat, we could not contemplate without dismay the prospect of Russian neighbourhood in Eastern or Southern Persia, the inevitable consequence of winch must be a great increase of our own burdens; while the maritime defensibility of India would require to be altogether reconsidered, were the dangers of a land invasion to be supplemented by the appearance of a possible antagonist as a naval power in waters contiguous to Indian shores. 49 . We cannot pretend to divine the future, or to say whether any European Power, and if so which, will at any time push her ad\ance to the point of claiming a maritime outlet in or near to the I ersian Criilf. 1 lie late of Mesopotamia lies beyond our ken: and it may be that in the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, some stronger Power may one day exercise ^ dominion at Baghdad, may occupy Basrah, and may demand access for its vessels to the neighbouring waters of the Gulf. Such a consummation, it is in our opinion,°in the interests of British policy, as long as may be possible, to postpone. But upon the question of allowing any European Power, and more especially Russia, to overrun Central and Southern Persia, and so to reach the Gulf, or to acquire naval facilities in the latter even without such territorial connections, we do not conceive that any doubt whatever can be entertained; and we imagine that it will be accepted as a cardinal axiom of British policy that no such development would be acquiesced in by Her Majesty’s Government. We would arrive with the greater confidence at this conclusion, since we were lately informed by Your Lordship that on April 15th of the present year, Lord Salisbury communicated to the Persian Government with reference to rumours of the cession of a port in the Gulf to Russia, that “ Her Majesty’s Government felt it to be their duty to renew the intimation that it would not be compatible with the interests of the British Empire that any European Power should exercise control or jurisdiction over the ports of the Persian Gulf”. 50. Such being the existing situation in Southern Persia, and the prin ciples of policy accepted by Her Majesty’s Government being as already stated, we pass to a consideration of the manner in which these principles should be translated into action, and of the steps which should, in our opinion, be taken at the present juncture for the protection of the common interests of Great Britain and the Indian Empire. 51. We are aware that, more than half a century ago, there were exchanged, and have more than once since been repeated, certain explicit assurances concerning the integrity and independence of Persia between the Governments of Great Britain and Russia. The first of these assurances were entered into by Lord Palmerston and Count Nesselrode. The former in a despatch, dated September 5th, 1834, placed on record that “ the Governments of Great Britain and Russia are acting, with regard to the affairs of Persia in the same spirit, and are equally animated by a sincere desire to maintain, not only the internal tranquillity, but also the independence and integrity of Persia ”. Count Nesselrode, in despatches, dated October 20 th, 1838, and January 29th, 1839, reiterated these pledges on behalf of his Government. Again in 1873 the continued existence of these mutual assurances was referred to with satisfaction by Count de Brunnow, as reported in a despatch by Lord Granville, dated July 10 th, 1873. Finally, on March 12 th, 1888, M. de Giers intimated, through M. de Staal, to Lord Salisbury that the Russian Government ‘‘ have no objection to placing again on record that their views on this point are in no v ay^ altered , and a communication to the effect that the engagements between Great Britain and Russia to respect and promote the integrity and independence of the Persian kingdom had again been renewed and confirmed was accordingly made by Sir H. D. Wolff to the Shah. hilst it may be presumed that these pledges, so frequently renewed, are still in existence, and while we Lave no desire to infer that they arewithin measurable distance of being broken, we are yet of opinion that they are in themselves quite insufficient to arrest the centripetal progress of liussian influence in Persia, or to save either the Persian kingdom, or British interests in it, from the erosive agencies that we have described. Within the limits of a nominally still existing integrity and independence so many encroachments upon both those attributes are possible, that by almost imper ceptible degrees they pass into the realm of constitutional fiction, where they may continue to provide an exercise for the speculations of the jurist, long after they have been contemptuously ignored by statesmen. 53. If tins proposition be accepted, and if we cannot rely upon written pledges to safeguard the future of Persia, it behoves us to examine the various alternative policies that have been or can be proposed. The first of these is the policy of a regeneration of Persia by Anglo-Bussian means; i.e., joint action by Great Britain and Russia to insist upon reforms, to reorganise the administration and finances, to develop the resources of the country, to lend the requisite means, in fact to convert the Persian Government by combined philanthropy from a moribund into a solvent institution. This policy was dis cussed and rejected by Sir M. Durand in his Memorandum of September 1895, on the ground that Russia would denounce us to the Shah to begin with, and would play us false afterwards; and in his despatch of Pebruary 1899, he again “ proceeds upon the assumption that we cannot hope to come to terms with Russia, and persuade her to join us in a policy of reform and development”. We concur with Her Majesty’s Minister in believing that the reform of Persia by a policy of friendly co-operation between Russia and ourselves is out of the question; and we do so in the main for the reason, which no one familiar with Persia will deny, that Russia is interested not in the reform of Persia, but in its decay; that in the background of her ambitions is the vision of a country and a people falling from inherent debility into her grasp; and that any policy which might tend to strengthen the country or to revivify the people, is to be resisted as tending to thwart the fulfilment of those ambi tions. We might give many illustrations in support of this proposition; but we will content ourselves with one. Sir M. Durand has lately supplied to the Foreign Office the version given by the Sadr Azam of the agreement between the Persian and Russian Governments, by which the former bound itself in 1889 not to grant any railway concessions to any other Power than Russia, except with the consent of the latter, for a period of 10 years. Whatever be the real facts of the case, there can be no doubt that this engagement, as long as it has lasted, and so long as it continues to last, is an effective barrier to any genuine development of the country. It was due to expire in the present year. Our latest information from Sir M. Durand is that it has, under pressure from the Russian Government, been renewed for another term of five years. 54. The alternative policy recommended by Sir M. Durand is that we should plainly intimate that any Russian encroachments in Northern Persia will provoke corresponding measures for the protection of British interests in the south. In his Memorandum of September 1895, Her Majesty’s Minister suggested that this declaration should be made to the Russian Government. In his despatch of February 1899 he proposed that it should also be made to the Persian Government; so that both parties should be well aware of the steps that would follow upon any further Russian aggression. It has been objected to this policy that such an engagement might impose upon the British Govern ment an unwelcome obligation to intervene and to add to British responsibi lities in Southern Persia, at the moment most opportune to Russia, and least opportune to ourselves. There is force in this objection; although w~e think that it might be met by introducing sufficient elasticity into the proposed intimation to leave Her Majesty’s Government free to act for the protection of British interests in Southern Persia, not in a specified manner at a specified moment, but in what manner and at what juncture might commend itself to their judgment. Moreover the value of the objection is somewhat weakened by the consideration that did Russia take any such step in Northern Persia as is here contemplated, counter-action of some sort, with or without a previous intimation, would in all probability be imposed upon Her Majesty’s Government; while the knowledge that a Russian advance in the north might be the signal[ 18 ] for a corresponding British move in the south would, it can scarcely he doubted, operate as a deterrent upon any premature activity on the part of Russia, since she might thereby gravely jeopardise the realisation of her own dreams of ultimate access to Southern Persia and the Persian (juir. 55. Nevertheless before we recommend that such a policy should he essayed, we desire to raise the question whether, though it be impossible to conclude an agreement with Russia for the joint patronage and development of Persia, it might not yet be possible to come to an understanding v ith her for the separate patronage and development of that country in distinct and clearly defined compartments by the two great Powers, m other words tor a recognition of British and Russian spheres of interest in the dominions of the Shah Ibis is a solution the desirability of which has not been lost sight of by Sir M. Durand, but which for certain reasons he did not feel called upon to discuss. Recent events in China have familiarised the public mind with the idea ol such spheres of interest, although their existence would appear to be still somewhat lacking both in clearness of definition and in precision of outline. Ihe Viceroy has observed in recent telegrams from Lord Salisbury to bir M. Durand with reference to a Persian loan and to mining concessions in that countiy, indications of a wullingness to concede to Russia liberties in the north of I eisia, parallel in scope and substance with those conceded to Great Britain in the south; and it is worthy of consideration whether in an expansion of this suggestion might not be found a feasible scheme. 56. We have already alluded to the line across Persia drawn by Sir M. Durand from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman to Seistan, as indicating the northern limits of the sphere within which British political influence and trade are paramount. To some extent this partition is assisted by geographical conditions, the great deserts of Central Persia constituting a natural barrier between the north and the south, and roughly dividing the one from the other. But this situation is modified both in the west of Persia, where there are no deserts, and where there is no physical line of demarcation between the respective spheres of influence; in the centre of Persia, where Ispahan can hardly be said to constitute the natural frontier of any geographical zone; and also in the extreme east where Seistan, the inclusion of which in the British sphere would be an obligatory point, lies not to the south but to the north of the great desert. These con siderations might not affect the success of any engagement that was carried out with equal bona jides by both parties: but they might become a fruitful source of friction were such a good understanding not to be counted upon in the future. In any case, we would recommend that the line of partition, suggested by Sir M. Durand, should he so far amended as to substitute Kashan for Ispahan. It w r ould be undesirable that any Russian railway should penetrate further south than Kashan, which indeed is separated by a considerable range of hills from Ispahan, or that Russia should have right of access to the very fringe of the latter district. 57. We have observed that in China the Agreement recently concluded between Her Majesty’s Government and Russia as to spheres of interest has related to railways only. Either party has pledged itself not to seek on its ow r n account or on behalf of others for railway concessions in the rival sphere,, and not to obstruct, directly or indirectly, applications for such concessions, supported by the other in that sphere. ]?rima facie there does not appear to be any reason why such an agreement should not equally be extended to mines, roads, and other industrial or economic undertakings. The value of such an understanding is considerable; because although political influence is not expressly mentioned, yet in eastern countries commercial and industrial enterprises are the familiar agencies through which political influence is exercised by alien powers, and because that influence is apt to follow in the wake of railways and trade. We do not think, if such an agreement were arrived at with Russia, with reference to the Persian territories lying north and soutli of the predicated line, that there u r ould be an end to Russian designs in Southern Persia or in the Persian Gulf. Such a result might, perhaps, ensue from an engagement that no political influence should be exercised by either party[ 19 ] on the opposite side of the line. But there would he manifest difficulties in arriving at any such understanding; since it would he out of the question to remove the British representatives, either at Tehran, at Tabriz, or at Meshed, whose functions necessarily involve the exercise of some sort of political influence, while a corresponding objection would no doubt be felt by the Russian Government. But even an engagement limited to railway and commercial exploitation would have this effect, that it would deprive Russia of the means by which political or territorial ambitions in the rival sphere could most easily be carried out, and -would render it difficult for her to push them to success, as long as Great Britain remained on the alert. 58. There are, however, difficulties and drawbacks in the case of such an understanding which it would be impolitic to ignore. We have already hinted at one of their number. The facts with reference to Seistan which have been mentioned by the Viceroy in his Minute, by Sir M. Durand, and also in this despatch, indicate the absolute necessity of including that district within the British sphere. Nevertheless Seistan is physically and administratively a part of the province of Khorasan, from which it is severed by no clear line of division, the Governorship of Seistan being vested in a member of the old ruling family of Kain, the two existing heads of which are brothers, residing respectively at Tabbas and Birjand. It also seems exceedingly doubtful to us whether Russia would, by any such agreement as we are discussing, forego her designs upon Seistan itself, and still more her chances of reaching the eastern extremity of the Persian Gulf. Nor again is it clear that she would be willing to cancel the engagement with regard to railway construction, which she has recently renewed with the Persian Government, and to hand over the southern half of Persia to possible railway exploitation by British agency, in return for a monopoly of similar exploitation (which may be said to be already at her disposal) in the northern half. These, however, are considerations which could only be decided by the attitude of Russia herself, were she •approached on the* subject by Her Majesty’s Government. We indicate them merely for the purpose of showing that we are far from confident that the suggestion, if put forward, will meet with a favourable reception. 59 . A more serious drawback, from the point of view of British interests, is the fact that the capital of Persia would lie in the northern or Russian sphere, and that Russian influence there, already predominant, could hardly fail to become supreme. The situation that has recently arisen in China would present itself with ten-fold gravity and emphasis. A desire would not merely be mti- mated to connect the capital with the Russian railway system : but a line itself would, we may imagine, at once be made to Tehran, while corresponding lines would in all probability be constructed from the Russian frontier in Georgia to Tabriz, and in Trans-Caspia to Meshed. With the three great cities of Northern Persia thus permanently linked with the Russian system, the power of pressure exercised by the Russian Government, wliich is already considerable, would be positively overwhelming. The results would, in all probability, be felt beyond the limits of Persia. They would aggravate the already formidable offensive strength of Russia against Northern Afghanistan, and would increase the weight and influence of her position throughout Central Asia. In Persia itself, the Shah would tend more and more to become a Russian puppet, and Northern Persia a Russian proconsulate. We should look with great anxiety, in such a case, upon the fate of such institutions as the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, whose head-quarters are in Tehran. We should fear a marked diminution of influence on the part of Her Majesty’s representative at the capital; and we do not conceal our anticipations that in the long run such a partition might involve the permanent break up of the Persian kingdom, and, if it did not ultimately lead to rival Russian and British Protectorates in the north and south, might at any rate result in the selection of another capital, and in the rule of more than one native prince in Persia. 60. Neither will it be overlooked by Her Majesty’s Government that, while any such arrangement with Russia might preclude that Power from obtainin° control over Central and Southern Persia and in that way reaching the Persian Gulf, it would not for one moment retard, but might on the[ 20 ] contrary accelerate her advance to the same objective through Mesopotamia by way of Baghdad. This is an issue which we should regard with scarcely inferior repugnance; hut the problem is one which we do not feel called upon to discuss upon the present occasion, and which would require to he examined on independent grounds. Nor again would an Anglo-Russian agreement pre clude iranee, or Germany, or any other Power from endeavouring to acquire in Southern Persia or in the Gulf the position from which Russia would ex hypothesi have debarred herself. There might even he combined action between them for that object. These however are features inseparable from the solution which we are discussing, and which would be of a less formidable character, if the influence of the principal competitor were removed from the scene. We should strongly deprecate the political rivalry of any European nation in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf; even though such a situation, while fraught vith constant annoyance, might not, as in the case of Russia, constitute a positive menace to the Indian Empire. 61. . There remains the further danger, distinctly contemplated by Sir M. Durand in discussing the question of a possible understanding with Russia, that she would not abide by the terms of any such understanding. Sufficient grounds tor this induction may unquestionably be found in the historv of Russian advance in Central Asia during the past half century. But an' appreciation of the inclinations and idiosyncrasies of both parties to an agreement, in the tight, where possible^of past experience, is an element in the drawing up of a fresh bargain which is not likely to be lost sight of by either agent, whether it be regarded as involving a discount from, or an appreciation of, the value of the new contract Moreover such contracts, if not of perpetual duration, or even if ultimately infringed by one of the two parties, have been shown in many cases to be of immense value, in the respite that they afford from the strain of an otherwise ceaseless rivalry, and in the opportunity presented for a peaceful consokdation of existing interests. ^ * 62. AVe liave now placed before Your Lordship the pros and com as thev present themselves to our eyes, of the alternative policies in Persia. ’ While not sanguine as to the prospects of success, we are ourselves of opinion that the experiment of an understanding with Russia as to future spheres of interest i ' : ' t eou, dry is wnrthy of being made, in the interests both of Persia itself and still more ot harmony between the two great Powers, upon whose relations e peace of Asia may be said to depend.

According to these figures, which we have been at much pains to verify, it appears that upon the various establishments maintained by the British Government in Persia, the Imperial Government spends £15,46^ and the Gov ernment of India £61,052 per annum. If Turkish Arabia be included in the calculation, as we think it must in fairness be, and as it was in a statement prepared for and presented to the Royal Commission on Indian expenditure in 1896, the totals will amount to Great Britain £15,597, India £71,656. 66. It will not, we apprehend, be denied that these contributions do not at all fairly represent the respective proportions of Imperial and of Indian interest in Persia and its surroundings. The argument into which we entered in an earlier part of this despatch will have failed in its purpose if it has not given good grounds for thinking that in the determination of British interests in Persia too much stress has hitherto been laid upon the Indian, and too little upon the British, quota; and that a more even partition both of responsibility and of financial burden might with reason be adopted in the future. 67. This however is a question which we are not at the present moment called upon to. discuss with any minuteness, the more so as it is understood to be one of the subjects that have attracted the attention of the Royal Commission above alluded to, and that are likely to be dealt with in its Report. We observe that in the evidence so far printed and published, some attention has been paid to the case, and we reserve till the appearance of the final Report, any further remarks that we may have to offer thereon. 68. We would observe, however, in strict connection with the question now under examination, viz., the increase of Consular and other establishments in Persia—which is itself a branch of the wider subject—that in the reconsider ation of the case for which the Government of India have mnro flinn rmnonnd either party would have its contribution more directly under its own control It would not be difficult m our opinion to constitute such a partition of interest* which would be determined by a combination of geographical, political and* commercial conditions. The parts of Persia that border upon Afghanistan Baluchistan and the eastern end of the Persian Gulf would naturally fall within the Indian sphere. The northern and western portions contiguous to the Caucasian provinces of Russia, to Turkey, and to Mesopotamia, would possess a gieater interest foi Her Majesty s Government. To a considerable, though still only a partial, extent this principle has already been acted upon; whilst it will be in the recollection of Your Bordship that the Government of India have in one case pressed for a vindication of it, which they have felt to be equally demanded by policy and justice. In February and again in August 1895, our predecessors expressed a very strong opinion that they should not be called upon to contribute towards the Karun service, as long as the subsidy for the mail service on the Tigris was met exclusively from Indian revenues. They stated their opinion that &lt;£ the interests involved in the Karun service are purely Imperial and not Indian, and, if this service ceases altogether, the interests of India will not be affected thereby It was only after the receipt of an urgent appeal from the Foreign Office, and on the explicit understanding that the whole question of the distribution of the charges on account of the Tigris and the Karun should be referred to the Royal Commission then sitting, that the Government of Lord Elgin, not without a vigorous dissent from the then Finance Member, Sir J. Westland, consented to continue the payment of a moiety of the Karun subsidy pending the stipulated decision. We cordially endorse the views which were expressed by our predecessors in respect of tbe Imperial and non-Indian character of this charge, and we shall be glad to learn what are the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the subject. 70. The mention of the Karun and Tigris services affords an incidental illustration of the commercial considerations by which the allocation of respon sibility that we are discussing might be determined. It is, of course, difficult to decide in the case of any particular market or harbour the exact shares of interest in it that may be claimed by British or by Indian trade. The former is more likely to be in tbe ascendant in the north, the latter in the south, of Persia. Broadly speaking, however, we do not think it will be disputed that the supervision and promotion of British commerce in foreign countries are a responsibility properly devolving upon the Imperial Government. The fact that a considerable proportion of tbe trade of any foreign town or port passes to or from India (and even of such trade a large part is apt to be often British in origin) is not a reason for placing the consular or other charges exclusively upon the Indian revenues, any more than a corresponding preponderance of Colonial trade in any particular quarter would be regarded as a reason for demanding a contribution from the Colonies. We imagine the real line of distinction to be that, whereas the commercial interests of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects, outside of India, are in the main the concern of the Imperial Government, yet in cases where the political importance of a place or district exceeds the commercial, and where that political importance is Indian rather than English in character, the Government of India may legitimately be called upon to defray sometimes a large proportion, some times the whole of the cost. In this way we may account for the exclusive financial responsibility of India for Meshed, for Bushire and the other ports of the Gulf, and for Baghdad (although we regard the latter as an extreme and questionable extension of the principle). On the other hand the charges for Ispahan, Kermanshah, Tabriz, &amp;o., fall, or ought in our judgment to fall, upon the Imperial revenues. Tehran, as the capital, is, in a sense, a meeting ground of the two systems ; and a division of the cost between the two Govern ments has accordingly been in existence ever since 1835, although the passage of time has witnessed a gradual reduction of the Indian contribution, and may, we hope, lead to a further reconsideration of the matter, when the present arrangement expires in 1901.[ 24 ] 71. We will now proceed to apply the principles which have been enunciated to a consideration of the particular question referred to us by Your Lordship, viz., the suggestions of Sir M. Durand on the one hand, and our own views or proposals on the other, concerning the increase of Consular and other establishments in Persia. We may say at once that we are anxious to regard the question from a broad-minded and liberal point of \iew, that we have no desire to haggle with Her Majesty , s Government o\ei shares of responsibility or of cost, and that we are quite willing to add to our ow n charges lor the protection of .British interests in Persia, in the confident belief that Her Majesty’s Govern ment will not be behindhand with a similar generosity. Our argument as to the magnitude and significance of those interests and the reality of the dangers with which they are assailed would have been insincere, were w r e unprepared to give to it a practical demonstration. 72. Toy the sake of clearness we will divide the country into different spheres, representing with sufficient accuracy the rough lines of demarcation between Dritish and Indian interest. In the northern and central sphere, and in the western sphere, the responsibility of Her Majesty’s Government is in our judgment more directly involved. In the eastern sphere, and in the southern or maritime sphere, we admit a corresponding preponderance of Indian interest. 73. Commencing with the first named of these areas, w 7 e find that Sir M. Durand recommends an improvement in the pay and status of Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz. In so far as our judgment on the matter is desired, it is in entire accord with the proposal. We are more doubtful about the suggestion to appoint an additional Vice-Consul at Tabriz, with the intention of posting him later on at Urumia; since we incline to the opinion that the ultimate destiny of the Persian Nestorians has been irretrievably fixed by their recent wholesale conversion to the Russian faith. We concur with Sir M. Durand as to the desirability of reducing the Consulate at Resht to a Vice- Consulate. We have before expressed our hearty concurrence with his pro posals concerning the Consulate at Ispahan. These proposals without excep tion concern in their financial aspect the .British, and not the Indian, Exchequer. 74. In the western sphere Sir M. Durand advocates the appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah, subordinate to the Consul-General at Tehran, and paid for by England, in place of the present native agent, whose modest allowance of £24 is drawn, for some unaccountable reason, from the charges lor the Meshed Agency, i.e., from Indian funds. The figures of British trade passing through Kermanshah from Baghdad to Tehran appear to us amply to justify the proposed change. We are less confident about a suggestion made by Sir M. Durand, originally in connection with this route, hut also with a wader application, namely, that we should depute an Indian onicer to examine the various possible routes for railways in Persia and to make suggestions. Such a proceeding wnuld, in our opinion, be both prema ture and uncalled for. Me are very doubtful whether in her present state of evolution Persia is prepared for railways. The recent renewal of the prohibi- rve agreemen w ith Russia shows that the latter Power does not for the present . 111 + 01 } icm introduced. Enquiries of the proposed character nl’pnrlv ' ccr ain . 0 a J 0l i se suspicion; and finally wo believe that we are verv fpw .

Lynch for the ur precious attitude on this subject will prepaiTour Lordship for our ready acceptance of these views. But we think that the entiie cost of the proposed Consulate and of such subordinate native agencies as may he required should be borne by Her Majesty’s Government, since we cannot too emphatically reiterate our opinion that India is only indirectlv interested in the Karun question. We shall be prepared to show a correspond ing liberality in quarters of more manifest importance to India. A Consul at Mohammerah (or Ahwaz or Shushter) would of course correspond with the British Resident at Bushire, as well as with Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. 76. M e next turn to the eastern sphere, where Indian interests may be described as supreme. Sir M. Durand throws out a hint that money might perhaps be saved at Meshed, where the existing establishment imposes upon Indian funds a charge of no less than £8,640 a year. We are inclined to a 'ree with him. Although in view of the proximity of Afghanistan, and of the militant character of Russian pretensions in Khorasan, it is desirable to maintain an adequate British representation at Meshed, we think that the present scale is excessive, and that the results obtained are incommensurate with the cost. We are considering whether by a reduction of the grade of the Political Agent now stationed there, and by the removal of the Political Assistant to some spot where his services would be of greater value, we might not be able to effect a considerable money saving, to be better applied elsewhere. We are sceptical also as to the value received for the large secret service grant at present made to the Meshed Agency, and expended in the main in procuring unreliable and almost worthless information through native and ill-informed agents. On the other hand, we are prepared to compensate fcr a less extrava gant expenditure at Meshed by a more vigilant attention to Seistan, and by strenuously fostering the trade route connecting that district with British Baluchistan. The political and strategical importance of Seistan appears to us to justify and even to necessitate the former attitude. We are encouraged to adopt the latter by the figures of trans-Nushki traffic, which have risen from a total of 1-| lakh in 1896 to Rs. 5,90,000 in 1897 and (in spite of an adverse season) to Rs. 7,28,000 in 1898, in which year the imports alone into Quetta from Seistan reached the value of Rs. 2,50,880. 77. We have some time past been examining the question of the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and the deputation of Captain Sykes from Kerman to Seistan in the present year, and the sanction of an annual expenditure of £400 from Indian revenues upon a Seistan Consulate, have already been mentioned. The reports of Captain Sykes are strongly adverse to the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and whilst we do not entirely concur with his reasoning, and regard his views as to some extent coloured by other prepossessions, we nevertheless are of opinion that such an appointment might for the present be postponed; the more so as it appears likely that the nomination of a Russian Consul to Seistan, though previously announced, is likely not to be persevered in, unless a British repre sentative appears permanently upon the scene. Should a Russian officer be finally appointed, we think that there wall be no alternative but to send a British officer also. In the meantime we are prepared to depute a reliable native agent from our Indian service to reside at Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan, and to appoint a second to reside at Birjand, the capital of Kain, both of these officials to be under the orders of the British Resident at Meshed, in correspondence with the Persian arrangements under which Seistan and Kain constitute a portion of the Governorship-General of Khorasan. We estimate that the annual cost of these two posts will amount to £150—£200 per annum more than the already sanctioned charge for the Seistan post; and this addition we are prepared to meet. In making these proposals we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are sure of the support both of Your Lordship and of the Poreign Office ; since, in a Revenue despatch, dated December 2nd, 1897, Your Lordship, in sending to us a letter from the Poreign Office, expressing their good hopes of the future of the Quetta-Meshed route, provided that Consular protection and other facilities were furnished at points along the road, com mended these remarks to the Government of India, and added: “I trust that the suggestion of' appointing Consular Agents at points along the trade route[ 26 ] between Quetta and Meshed may receive the attentive consideration of Your Excellency’s Government. It appears to me a measure desirable from many points of view, and especially in connection with the facilities which might be afforded bv that route for the transport of arms and ammunition between the Persian Gulf and Baluchistan Since writing the above paragraph, we have received news by telegraph of the appointment of another llussian officer as Consul to Seistan. We shall await the realisation of this announcement, and shall, in that case, be prepared to modify our proposals in the sense already indicated. 78. As regards the trade route in question, we propose to take active measures for its development within our own territory. We contemplate spending addi tional, though not extravagant, sums upon the better provision of wells, accom modation, supplies of fodder and other stores, and the protection of the track. We may even require to appoint a second British officer, to relieve Lieutenant Webb Ware of the excessive strain now imposed upon him by the administration of an extensive district, in addition to the protection of a road over 400 miles in length. We hope by these measures, which will be unostentatiously pursued, to escape the jealousy aroused by a too open challenge of rival ambitions in Seistan, and to build up in that neighbourhood a substantial commercial and political interest, which will find no mean ally in what we believe to be the natural predisposition of the inhabitants. Experience alone can inform us whether the anticipations that have been framed by the prospects of the Nushki-Seistan trade route are over-sanguine, as in some quarters they are freely said to be. If unsuccessful, the experiment which we now propose to make can be abandoned without discredit. If, as we believe, it will be found to have both a political and a commercial value, w r e shall be better enabled in the future to pronounce upon the larger schemes which have sometimes been put forward in connection with Seistan, and a reference to which will be found in the Minute written by the Viceroy. At present, it does not seem to us to be necessary to take them into consideration. 79. We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that a British Consul should be permanently appointed to Kerman. We have already sanctioned a contribution of Bs. 6,000 or £400 a year to the cost of this post; and we are prepared to continue the payment of this sum. M e believe that there are good reasons for which Her Majesty’s Government may desire to continue the pay ment of a similar moiety of the cost. But should their acceptance of the increments proposed elsewhere, notably in the case of the Karun, be facilitated by our assumption of the entire cost of the Kerman Consulate, we should be prepared, favourably to consider such a proposal; or, if it were preferred, to divide with them the cost of the Karun and Kerman Consulates combined. I lie financial result would in either case be approximately the same. 80 Sir M. Durand has suggested a British Vice-Consul, or a native agent at Bampur. Eor the present we think that the latter will be the prefer able alternative; and we are prepared to undertake the outlay, which will not exceed about £300 per annum. The officer in question would be under the oiders of the British Consul at Kerman. 01 . of the Per«; Q p ip t0 T the 1 s ?V thern s P h ere, including the coasts and porl of the Persian Gulf Your Lordship will have been prepared by what ha previously been said for the announcement of our willingness to submit some sacrifices for the defence of an interest, so substantially ' rounded and s eestionS any materia^ 6t0 aSrCe with Sir M.

We are heartily in accord with Sir M. Durand in thinking that a British officer should be appointed to Bunder Abbas, with charge of the Gulf ports east of Bushire, and of British interests in the maritime provinces of South eastern Persia. The necessity of such an appointment was mooted, as long ago as 1879, by Colonel Boss, at that time British Besident at Bushire. It was raised again in 1882,1884, 1885,1888 and 1892, and on the majority of these occasions was supported by petitions from the not insignificant Hindu and Khoja popula tion engaged in trade at Bunder Abbas. In 1893, the appointment as Vice- Consul of an Englishman engaged in business at that port was agreed to by the Government of India and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State (Lord Kimberley), but was subsequently dropped upon the inexplicable grounds that the estimated cost of Bs. 50 a month or £10 a year could not be saved out of the Bushire Besidency funds. In 1896, the question was again discussed between the Government of India and the Besident (Colonel Wilson); and the former so far departed from their former attitude as to say that the proposal must be held over until the normal conditions of trade had been restored by the withdrawal of the Bussian sanitary cordon. These conditions have since been fulfilled, and we are prepared to look with a more favourable eye upon a proposal, the intrinsic recommendations of which are not open to dispute. We are willing to accept the financial responsibility for the proposed appoint ment, although w r e think that it may be possible to meet it without additional cost by the transfer to Bunder Abbas of the Political Assistant now stationed at Meshed. Sir M. Durand suggests that the officer appointed to this post should pass the summer months at Yezd (Bunder Abbas being an impossible site of residence during the hot season), taking the place there of the present unpaid Commercial Vice-Consul. Upon this point we would propose to consult Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, which is in close connection with Bunder Abbas and the coast; and w T e wall submit to Your Lordship at a later date our final views upon this subject. 83. Sir M. Durand mentions, as a matter affecting exclusively the Govern ment of India, the possible appointment of a British officer at Bahrein. We do not hesitate to state to Your Lordship that such an appointment is in our opinion both desirable and obligatory. Trouble, similar to that which we have already incurred in Maskat, is brewing in Bahrein, the treaty engagements of which petty State wdth Her Majesty’s Government provide no legitimate excuse for such complications. It is necessary to anticipate them by placing a British officer permanently in the island; and w T e are at the present time awaiting Colonel Meade’s definite proposals on the matter. We are inclined to think that it will probably be sufficient to nominate an officer of a sub ordinate class. Erom time to time he will also visit Koweit. It remains to be decided whether he should also have under his political jurisdiction the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab or Pirate coast, or whether these should be placed under the officer at Bunder Abbas. We incline to the former opinion, but reserve this matter for subsequent decision. 84. We have now dealt with each one of Sir M. Durand’s specific pro posals, and have stated our own views in support, in amendment, or in supplement of them. It remains for us to mention some additional proposals of our own, and to comment upon certain independent suggestions submitted by Her Majesty’s Minister. We entertain, and have already in the present year acted upon, the opinion that Her Majesty’s naval forces should be more strongly and frequently represented than they have hitherto been in the Persian Gulf, and that there should be recurrent visits from the Admiral of the East Indian station. During the past spring Admiral Douglas, at the request of the Viceroy, paid such a visit, and his presence was of material assistance during the recent crisis at Maskat. We are doubtful of the wisdom of the existing system, under which the political charge of the Makran coast, and the[ 28 ] distribution of the Telegraph subsidies, is vested in the Director-General of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Karachi, to whom a special salary of £120 is paid by the Government of India for the purpose. It. has been proposed to us that this charge should be transferred to the Political Agent at Maskat; and for the present we reserve our opinion as to the advantages of such a change. It would be eminently desirable that Maskat should be connected by cable with Jask, since at jwesent there is no telegraphic communi cation with any part of Oman. But this too is a question that must wait for a later solution. 85. Sir M. Durand has proposed that all British Consular officers in Persia should have a small guard of Indian troopers similar to those now maintained at Meshed. We are not clear that such a proposal is at present desirable, and are apprehensive that it might lead to movements on the part of Itussia, for which not even the necessities of a plague cordon could be pleaded in justifi cation, and which would scarcely be distinguishable from armed occupation. In this respect we re-echo the opinion which the Government of India expressed to Your Lordship as recently as August 10th, 1898, to the effect that Indian interests are sufficiently involved to justify us in furnishing protective detach ments, as we are now doing at Jask and Charbar, for Telegraph stations on the coast; but that our military provision must, for the present, be limited to this service. 86. Her Majesty’s Minister also recommends the grant of a supply of travelling tents to every British officer in Persia. As the majority of these, under the proposed arrangements, will be upon the Indian list, the suggested outlay would require in such cases to be met from Indian funds. W T e do not think that any general rule is required. We are in the habit of including camp equipment in the outfit of any officer whose duties require him to travel. We may observe, however, that tents are more likely to be required in out-of- the-way parts of the country than they are along the main roads, where the existing chapar or postal service, although destitute of almost every superficial merit, is nevertheless more rapid and therefore as a rule more convenient than travelling by caravan. 87. Lastly, Sir M. Durand makes certain recommendations with regard to the improvement and better organisation of the Telegraph service in Persia both native and European. We concur with his suggestion that no oppor tunity should be lost of getting the Persian wires, which are abominably mismanaged, transferred to our control. He then revives a suggestion, of which much has been heard during the last 20 years, that we should &lt;&lt; organise for political purposes” the existing establishment of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; although we do not gather very clearly from his despatch°what are the precise measures recommended for that purpose. The last occasion on which a somewhat similar proposal appears to have been made was in 1887 wlien a Memorandum, dated April 27th of that year, was drawn 'up by Sir Murdoch Smith, who was despatched on a semi-political Mission to Persia' and who recommended that capable military officers should be scattered about the country nominally m charge of the Telegraph stations, but in reality as political agents In a despatch, dated June 24th, 1887, the Government of India expressed a general, but guarded, approval of the scheme. In our opinion there are two sides to the question, for each of which much can be said 1 THs surprising to us that an institution and a service that have exercised s'uch an influence and are so generally popular in Persia, as the Indo-European Tele-mnh Department, should not have been attended with more visible political effect On the other band, m proportion as the working of the line has become svstem- atiscd, so there has been less call for the tvue of EnoW™ ( 0me ^ vstem required during earlier and more troubled days The^woA aftbe m‘° T of the stations does not admit of much leisure on the part o/ the «m J n y and line inspectors. At the more important posts we beheve L a able, though unobtrusive, influence is already exerted by the sLorfnr nffL 6 '’’ and we are not convinced that the appeamnee upon The IneTa numW[ 29 ] 0 ffi^ ers &gt; whose telegraphic duties would in reality he subordinate to political or semi-political functions, might not arouse suspicion and even produce some friction. We do not desire, however, to pronounce definitely upon the subject, and shall be glad to be acquainted with the views that are entertained by lour Lordship. 88. Before leaving the subject of Persia, we desire to add an appeal upon a matter which we have already argued to be so closely connected therewith as to be inseparable from a discussion of our interests in that part of the world. The proposals that we have submitted do not contemplate any change in the existing arrangements in lurkish Arabia. Nevertheless, we cannot too strongly state our conviction that those arrangements, financially considered, are unduly hcirsh in their application to India, and unduly lenient in their incidence upon Great Britain. That the charges borne by Indian revenues for the maintenance of our political and commercial position upon the Tigris and at Baghdad, should amount to £10,604 a year, while the contribution of Her Majesty’s Government to the same objects is limited to £131 a year, appears to us to be a partial and inequitable division. We recognise that there are advantages to British interests generally in maintaining at Baghdad an establishment on the scale and of the importance that are associated with an Indian Residency of the second class. But the objects for which such an establishment is there kept up are neither exclusively, nor, as we think, mainly Indian in character. The same remark applies to the Basrah Consulate, where Her Majesty’s Govern ment have recently taken into their hands the appointment of the Consul, while leaving the entire charge to be defrayed from Indian funds. Least of all can such a claim be made for the Tigris subsidy, which, in our opinion, falls into the category of commercial arrangements properly devolving upon Her Majesty’s Government; although under existing conditions the total cost is borne by Indian revenues. We trust that, in any reconsideration of the case, a more generous division of financial responsibility may commend itself to Her Majesty’s Government. 89. We have now completed our survey of the proposals that have been submitted to us for examination, and of the situation in Persia as it presents itself to our eyes. In commending our views to the earnest consideration of Your Lordship and of Her Majesty’s Government, we trust that we may have succeeded in impressing upon both, the gravity of the situation with which Great Britain and India are jointly faced, and the necessity, while there is yet time, of meeting it with definite and united counsels. We conclude by reiterat ing the confident hope, already expressed in our despatch of August loth, 1898, that in the last resort, and in any sudden emergency, we may rely upon Her Majesty’s Government for the protection of interests which are vital both to India and to the British Empire. We have the honour to be, My Loud, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CURZON OE KEDLESTON. „ W. -S'; Av LOCKHART. „ E. H. H. COLLEN. „ C. M. RIYAZ. „ C. E. DAWKINS. „ T. RALEIGH. „ R. GARDINER.1899. SIMLA. FOREX ON - DEPART MEISTT. SECRET. External. Enclosure of a letter to Rer Majesty's Secretary of State for India, No. 175, dated the 21st September 1899.MINUTE by the VICEROY on SEISTAN, dated September 4th, 1899. I propose, in this Minute, to examine the present aspect of the Seistan question in relation to our general policy towards Persia, and to the attitude of Russia in Persia. In my book on Persia, I wrote a chapter on Seistan (Vol. I, Chap. IX) which contained as full an account of that district, its history, inhabitants, features, and commercial and political significance, as was then (1892) procurable. I also discussed the political ambitions of Russia in con nection with Seistan (Vol. I, pages 201, 216-218, 235-244; Vol. II, pages 597- 598,605), and the question of a possible Seistan Railway from India in the future (Vol. I, pages 237-24-4, 628-629). I ventured further to make certain recommendations, namely, that we should establish Consular or other represent ation {a) at Yezrt, [b) at Kerman, (&lt;?) in Seistan, (d) at Bunder Abbas; (e) that the Kerman-Meshed trade route should be improved; (/) that a British trade route should be opened from Quetta to Seistan; (g) that the question of railway extension in the direction of Seistan should be considered. Of these recommendations, I am glad to say that, during the interval that has since elapsed, (a), (5), (&lt;?), (&lt;?) and (/) have already been carried into execution. In the despatch with which this Minute is enclosed, {d) is recommended by the Government of India. I propose shortly to discuss the j&gt;resent aspect of (p). The references which have been given will dispense me from recajfitulating the elementary facts about Seistan; and I may commence with an account of what has happened during the past 7 years, leading up to a description of the status quo. 2. Seistan was in 1892 a beluh or sub-division of the district of Kain (capital Birjand) which is a part of the province of Khorasan (capital Meshed). The Government of Kain has for long been in the hereditary possession of a powerful family of Arab origin, whose head bears the title of Amir of Kain, and who, until the centralising tendencies of recent years, exercised an authority almost independent of that of the Shah. Mir Alam Khan, who had filled the post for over a quarter of a century, died in 1891. For reasons into which it is not necessary to enter, the younger of his two sons, Ismail Khan, known as the Shaukat-ul-Mulk (now about 50 years of age), succeeded him as Governor of Kain at Birjand. The elder son, Ali Akbar Khan, known as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, became Governor of Tabbas and Seistan,—posts which he only retains by the process, familiar in Persia, of the annual payment of a large sum in cash to the Shah. The third son, Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, now just grown up, was made Sartip or Commandant of the Kain forces. The Shaukat- ul-Mulk and he have generally, but perhaps erroneously, been believed to incline towards Russia, whose aim has been to get Seistan, now to some extent separated from Kain, re-incorporated in it, and absorbed as an ordinary administrative district in the province of Khorasan. Such an amalgamation would emphasize the dependence of Seistan upon Meshed, from which it is now in some measure separate. 3. Meanwhile the elder brother, or Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has not himself resided in Seistan, but has deputed one of his sons, Mir Masum Khan, a fat and lethargic youth of about 18, to act as Deputy Governor at Nasirabad, under the tutelage of his mother, a lady with considerable powers of intrigue. This son is supposed to intrigue with the uncle at Birjand and is not on the best of terms with his father, who in 1898 sent an elder son, named Muhammad Reza Khan, to supersede him as Deputy Governor. Upon Mir Masum Khan declin ing to go, the quarrel was patched up; and he still acts for his father in Seistan. Thus the local situation is that of Russia endeavouring to increase her hold uponL 2 ] the ruler of Kain (to whom she sent, a few weehs ago, a special mission con- veying presents valued at £1,400); and the ruler of Kam endeavouring to oust his brother and to establish a hold upon Seis an nmsc 4. Since the appointment of a British Consul-General at Meshed (m consequence of a similar Russian appointment) in l8S9, Seistan ndnch is included in the Consul’s jurisdiction, has been ^° d upon by British officers either from India or from Meshec. . n 4 ? r visited it in 1892-93. Colonel Yate made a tour thither m 1 c 9 f, and strongly urged the appointment of a British Indian representative m Seistan, to balance the Russian native agent, whom he found exercising considerab e influence. He enlarged upon the wheat-producing capabilities of Seistan, the cheapness of grain there as compared with the dearness outside, the advantage oi export ing the surplus supply to Quetta, the utility of a postal service from C mman via Seistan to Meshed, in place of the Kandahar-Herat line; and he recom mended the construction of a line of wells and the planting oi lev y posts horn Nushki to the Seistan border, so as to open a new carav an route tor indo- Persian trade. His report was shown to the Shah, who agreed Colonel Yate’s description of the political situation in Seistan, and, m so iai. as they concerned Persia, with bis recommendations. The Government of India were, however, at that time under the impression, which has since been abandoned, that anv evidence of British interest in Seistan or in Eastern. Persia would merely bring down the Russians (who have come down without it), and would tempt them to extend their railway southwards (which they hav e since done independently of any British move). Accordingly Colonel Yate s proposals were rejected. 5. Two years later Captain McMahon, who had been employed upon the demarcation of the Baluch-Afghan boundary (in pursuance of the Durand Agree ment of 1893), submitted a memorandum to the Government of India (dated June 21st, 1896), in which he strongly recommended the opening of the route which had been negatived in 1894, and the adoption of proper measures for its protection, and for the exercise o£ political authority up to the Persian border. The Government of India accepted these proposals, and submitted them to the Secretary of State in a despatch, dated September 16th, 1896. The latter replied on October 23rd, giving his sanction, and observing that—“ In the interest of the trade between India and Persia, it seems to me very desirable to further its development by this route”. In the ensuing month Lieutenant Webb Ware was appointed Political Officer at Chageh, and was instructed to establish levy posts, and to take other steps for the prompt execution of the new scheme. 6. This officer started upon his first visit to Seistan in January and returned in June 1897. He found Russian influence much in evidence in Seistan, wdiere he pleaded for the early installation of a British Agent. With regard to the commercial possibilities of Seistan, he reported that “ Seistan’s staple products are grain, ghi (clarified butter) and wool. If facilities for carriage were to be improved, it is by no means impossible that the future may see an extensive Perso-Baluch grain-trade called into existence”. Upon his outward, and again upon his return, journey, he took steps, by the opening of wells, by the building of guard-houses and godowns, and by the institution of levy posts, for the energetic promotion of the new trade route; and he submitted a number of further proposals, with that object in view, to the Government of India. . 7. Lieutenant Webb Ware’s visit to Seistan overlapped that of Surgeon- Major Brazier-Creagh, who in April of the same year was hurriedly despatched by the Government of India to Seistan, to carry out any plague precautions that might be required in that neighbourhood in anticipation of the preventive proceedings that Russia had announced her intention of putting into effect. His report testified to the great activity of Russia in Seistan, and contained a glowing and highly coloured picture of the capabilities of the country, which, with a somewhat proleptic fancy, he designated the Pearl of Persia. “Being a rich grain-growing, large pasturage, camel and flock-rearing district, wdiose resources under proper control could be hugely increased, it might be turned[ 3 ] into a regular garden He described the climate as far from bad, and the difficulties of access from Meshed as greater than those from Baluchistan. He thought that a large field was open for the import of green tea into Persia by the Nushki route ; and he strongly recommended the appointment of a native agent and assistant apothecary in-Seistan. 8. A year later Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, Native Attache to the British Consulate at Meshed, and a very capable officer, was deputed to return to India by the new route, in the company of a trial caravan of Meshed merchants. Their journey lasted from April till July 1898—unfortunately the hottest and least propitious season of the year. At its close Maula Bakhsh, whose report is the best that I have yet read upon the country traversed, wrote that—“ The Indian traders with my caravan, although disappointed by losses of camels, difficulties of transport and want of water at certain places, have not formed an unfavourable view of the new trade route, and they intend to advise their firms to send goods by it in the future”. There were wanted, however, better arrangement for water-supply, more godowns, and superior provision for storing fodder. The road was pronounced not yet suitable for merchants, travellers, or pilgrims, unaccustomed to rough travelling. Never theless the journey from Meshed to Quetta—62 marches or 1,090 miles—was performed by Maula Bakhsh and his caravan in 65 days. Including the average number of halts, viz., 10, he pointed out that the normal duration of the journey— i.e., 72 days, would yet be shorter than the 75—90 days usually occupied in traversing the alternative route, 966 miles long, between Meshed and Bunder Abbas. 9. In the same year, 1898, Lieutenant Webb Ware submitted his first Annual Report, which, in spite of the obstructive measures adopted by the Russian officers on the pretext of plague in Khorasan, recorded a gratifying advance. In an appendix on Nushki trade, he pointed out that the route was growing in favour, and that out of nothing had been created a trade, which had risen from 1^ lakhs in 1896 to Rs. 5,90,000 in 1897. The main impediments were the total lack of supplies, other than those specially imported, on the road between Nushki and the Seistan frontier, and the illegal extortion of the Persian toll-collectors (many of them in Russian pay) in Persian terri tory. Notwithstanding, he thought that the Quetta-Seistan route would even tually beat the Bunder Abbas route to Meshed, because merchandise carried by the latter required to change hands several times in transit, because a longer time was required for the journey thereby, and because the road was less secure than one running uninterruptedly through British territory. 10. In the present year, the same officer’s second Annual Report testifies to a continued improvement both in the amenities of the route, and in the trade returns, which have increased by Its. 1,38,000 since 1897. A new bazar, containing 126 shops, has been laid out at Nushki, which has developed from a petty group of daub and wattle huts into a small town; and which, now that the Nushki district has been (in the summer of 1899) permanently taken over by the Government of India, is certain of a prosperous future. Through out the past year a weekly dak has been maintained from Quetta to the Seistan frontier, in correspondence with a bi-weekly Persian dak from thence via Nasirabad and Birjand to Meshed. Alterations and short cuts in the route have reduced the distance from Nushki to Meshed to 954 miles, as compared with 966 miles from Bunder Abbas to the same destination. 11. An independent light has been thrown upon Seistan in the same period by the visit of Captain Sykes, who was despatched thither as Consul at the end of 1898 in consequence of the appointment of a Russian Consul to Nasirabad. Captain Sykes, who has for some time been Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, and who has been greatly interested in the rival Bunder Abbas- Kerman-Meshed trade route, arrived in Seistan in January 1899, with pre possessions already so strongly formed in favour of the older route, and against the new competitor, that before he had been there a week, he pronounced against the permanent appointment of a Political Officer to Seistan, and in[ 4 ] favour of Ms own return to Kerman. He was also in a position to say that “ the Quetta route ?which he had never seen) is hopelessly handicapped by its natural dhadvanta .es” These and other conclusions of Captain Sykes were vigorously disputed by Coionel Temple, our Agent and Consul-General at Meshed But they arc not without their value, as showing the reverse side oi the shield to that which has perhaps, with a pardonable optimism, been displayed by the various officers who have been concerned in the inception or development of the enteric from the Indian side. In subsequent letters, Captain bykes reiterated his opinions as to the superiority in respect of water, camel-grazing, and sup plies of the Bunder Abbas route; but so far receded rom his original attitude as to admit that there was a great opening on the Indian route lor impoits of tea and indMo, and that on political grounds its opening was important, adding, “ The larger the parties that visit Seistan and the more frequently hey appear the greater the political effect will be On February 14 h, he explained “ how necessary it is to provide the funds, by the careful expenditure of which Seistan may be brought nearer to India ”, and urged that “ it is of paramount import- ance to take advantage of the proximity of our frontiers and not to allow Russian trade and influence to be pushed to our very door ”. On Apnl 18th, while adhering to his views about the superiority of the Bunder Abbas road o\ er the Indian route, he nevertheless remarked that “the Seistams generally, and the Baluchis in particular, all look towards the Bast and bouth, wbile t icir oca 1 commerce is now mainly carried on with Quetta”, and that “ the reviva ot the Seistan-Quetta route, the buildings erected along it and the other proofs of British activity, have helped to increase our prestige . lie now advocated placing a smart Muhammadan native agent in Seistan “ to supervise the post •which I earnestly hope will he made permanent” ; and in a later letter, on May 22th, he urged &lt;c the establishment of an Indian lost Office at iiirjand, as veil as in Seistan, with a competent news-writer for each district which “ modest scheme should he sanctioned and carried out without delay In the last letter received from him, dated June 1st, Captain Sykes expressed his final opinion as adverse to the appointment of a British Consul for Kain and Seistan, unless a Russian Consul were sent (in which case it would become obligatory). It will he seen, therefore, from a synopsis of Captain Sykes’s reports, that, while he remains unfavourable to the prospects of the Quetta-Seistan route, as compared with the old trahs-Persian road, he has come round to. the opinion, which no previous traveller in Seistan has questioned, that it is essential that British interests, commercial and political, should be sustained in that quarter by an energetic and liberal maintenance of the line of connec tion with India, but that, for their support in Seistan itself, it will he sufficient for the present, unless a more active course he imposed by Russian initiative, to rely upon Indian native agents. These recommendations I have accepted in the draft despatch to the Secretary of State. I should add that Colonel Temple, who has throughout disputed many of Captain Sykes’s statements and dissented from his conclusions—partly owing to a not unfounded suspicion that Captain Sykes was advising in a spirit of undue independence of Meshed— has urged, in view of the recent renewal of plague alarms in Eastern Persia, that a native agent, if sent from India, should be a medical officer, charged in addition with the necessary political work. Although I believe these alarms to have been factitious, and to have been fomented by Russia for political purposes in 1899, as in 1897, I have so far acted upon Colonel Temple’s advice as to send a Hospital Assistant from Quetta to Seistan as news-writer and medical reporter for a period of 6 months. Such is the present state of our information, and of affairs, in Seistan. 12. It will he seen from what I have written that Seistan is, by virtue of its position and its features, an object of much interest both to Russia and Great Britain. Situated at the point of junction of the frontiers of Persia, Afghan istan, and Baluchistan, its future affects the destinies of all three countries. Lying, as it does, almost midway between Meshed and the Persian Gulf, no advance can he made from Khorasan to the sea except through Seistan. Its position upon the exposed flunk of Afghanistan would render its occupation of[ 6 ] great value to any Power contemplating either a move against that country, or an advance upon Kandahar. Nor will it be denied that the Kandahar-Herat line could not be held with safety by India, nor the valley of the Helmand defended, were a hostile Power in possession of Seistan. Eurthermore, the grain- producing capabilities of the district, to the bygone richness of which eloquent testimony is borne by the immense number of ruined cities encumbering the soil, and which could without serious difficulty be revived by a scientific employ ment of the waters of the Helmand, render Seistan of much value, as a possible granary, either to a Power engaged upon a forward advance, or to a Power interested in commercial and industrial expansion. 13. The force of these circumstances has, it will have been observed, com pelled the Government of India to display a concern in Seistan, which, at the start, they were most reluctant to acknowledge, and which, at varying intervals since, they have, with unconscious inconsistency, affected to repudiate. I have already cited the reply returned to Colonel Yate in 1894. Between 1894 and 1898 the Nushki-Seistan trade route was, with the sanction and upon the encourage ment of the Secretary of State, deliberately opened by the Government of Indiana Political Officer was appointed to administer the district between Nushki and the Persian border; officers were repeatedly despatched to report upon the country and to evince an interest in its fortunes. And yet as recently as August 10th, 1898, the Government of India in writing to the Secretary of State referred to the apprehensions of Lord Dufferin’s Government in 1887 that “ activity in the direction of Seistan might lead to a forward move on the part of Russia”; and gave it as their opinion that “premature activity was likely to prevent or postpone the future success of the new route from Quetta to Seistan”. 14. I am quite unable to understand either the force of this logic or the consistency of this conduct. The cautious and, in its motive, praiseworthy abstention of the Government of India from displaying any interest in Seistan, did not for one moment affect the designs, or retard the advance of Russia in that direction. Russian news-writers were firmly established in the district before anything more than a casual visit had been paid by a British officer. 'While members of the Government of India were writing notes to show that, if even a caravan route were opened from Quetta in the direction of Seistan, the Russians would extend their trans-Caspian Railway southwards, the latter were already at work, laying their rails from Merv to the Kushk post, and preparing the plant for an ultimate extension to Herat. Sir M. Durand, in a paragraph of his recent despatch, has exposed the hollowness of this plea; and I venture to hope that it may not figure again in our reasoning. 15. Similarly, I am unable to comprehend how—the trade route having been deliberately opened—any activity in developing it can either be premature, or can possibly prevent or postpone hopes which the trade route itself has been called into existence to realise, and which, without it, would have had no being. Either the Nushki-Seistan trade route is a bond-fide enterprise, upon which we have designedly embarked, in the main, because of its commercial possibilities, but also not without an eye to the extreme political importance of Seistan; or it is a fortuitous and foolish experiment, not likely or intended to succeed. In the latter case let us be wise and drop it. In the former let us be honest, and make the best job of it that we can. 16. I have no hesitation in recommending the last named course: and I do so, not because I am carried away by the gratifying, though modest, achieve ments of the new trade route up to date, nor because I contemplate for it an early and brilliant success. On the contrary I regard the obstacles and difficul ties as considerable; and, knowing the traditional conservatism of the East, I recognise that commerce will not readily be diverted into a new, and, at first sight, somewhat unattractive channel. But I urge a strenuous continuation of the venture, with an eye to a twofold contingency, political and commercial, in the future. 17. In the first place if we do not continue to show an active interest in Seistan, Russia will. If we do not give the impression there of preponderant[ 6 ] influence, Russian authority will soon supplant ours. If, either hy plague cordons or otherwise, the Nushki-Seistan traffic he killed, there will on y remain the single access of the Bunder Abbas road for Indian trade to Khorasan, and this it will be easy for our rivals to close by similar tactics If we do not desire Russia to advance to the Persian Gulf, the obvious method is to block the most direct of her paths. Looking to the future of Northern Khorasan, which is inevitably destined to pass under Russian control, it should be our obiect to draw the line of demarcation between the Russian and the British spheres at the point best suited to our interests, and not to hers. The home districts of Khorasan end with Turbat-i-Haidari, SO miles south of Meshed. Ihey will doubtless follow the fortunes of the capital. 18. South of this district comes that of Kain already possessing a semi-independent chiefship, which might very well be retained as a buffer between the opposing spheres. Seistan should, for all the reasons given, be included in the British sphere of interest. It is no exaggeration to say that we cannot afford to see it excluded. 19. Secondly, a study of the history and features of Seistan, no less than of all modern reports upon it, leads to the conclusion that the future of that country will depend, as did its past, upon the proper employment of the immense water-supply from the Helmand that now runs riot and goes to waste in vast lagoons, and reed-beds, and swamps. The greater part of Seistan is, during several months in the year, under inundation. Captain Sykes, in one of his letters, has estimated its present population at 00,000. In another, he has said that, under a proper system of irrigation, the land would support “ perhaps a tenfold population ”. In a third he has said that, if the Helmand were properly controlled, the population might rise to a million or more. It is clear, therefore, that the future of Seistan will lie with those who control the entire course of the Helmand. It should be in their power to turn the desert jnto a garden, and to make the wilderness blossom like a rose. 20. Now it can hardly be doubted that a day will come, when, in response to an external challenge, Great Britain will be obliged to advance to Kandahar. So fully is this probability admitted, that the arrangements for the advance, including the rails, the mobilisation camp, and the water-supply at Chaman have already been made. When Kandahar is re-occupied, the valley of the Helmand will be occupied with it. Then will come the time, when the channel and the valley of that river, now running parallel to the British border, though at no great distance from it, having passed under British control, the regenera tion of Seistan will for the first time become practicable, and it will be possible to revive its former fame as one of the granaries of that part of Asia. No wise man can be anxious to precipitate or even to hasten that consummation. But on the other hand no wisdom in the world can greatly retard it; and when the hour strikes, it would seem to me to be as well that Seistan should be waiting to be regenerated by us, instead of having already been absorbed in the regem erative embraces of others. 21. Ror these reasons, I recommend that in the intervening years, the Government of India should continue, by constant, but unpretentious, activity in fostering the trade route, in providing for its security, and in reducing its discomforts, and by a steady assertion of British authority up to the borders of Seistan and of British influence within it,—to build up an interest in Seistan which shall save for India an area and a market of so much potential value. With this object I urge that we should be willing to spend a little money-—it will amount at the most to only a few thousand pounds—-upon a venture that would be defensible, even if it were doomed to failure, but that appears, on the contrary, to be attended with reasonable hopes of success. 22. There remains only to be considered the question of a possible railway connection between India and Seistan. This question has been discussed at intervals during the past 12 years, and the history of the discussion is not without its lessons for the future. The first idea of some such railway appears to have originated with the late Sir J. Browne, who, as early as 1881, advocated a line[ 7 ] the'He^mancL^Thi^'proposal'wa^nvi'f for US ^^l* , ® el ' s * ;an, ' 3U ^ : to Safar on for strategical reasons ^amelv fn nv 1 Wltll0ut an 7 reference to Persia, llussian advance upon Kandahar If * ^ ^ P r ®7 entj at an 7 future period, a study of the papers, what I did not v? 1 ? terestm ^ to me ta learn from a I was travelling in Persia, and was fir^- r 016 ’ ^*’ ^ la .f ^ ye years later, when been raised both in India ami in P * • V 1U ^ a J0U ^ ^ lls question, it had just time head of the Tntenten” DemZei i'T? ^ C °. l0ne 1 1 Bel1 - at that 1888 marched from India hv TClTn , I 1 d , la ’ who . ln the autumn of recommended the construction of n rail ^ to .

This line of argument was completely riddled tLeHeTdZft’lm’ d I at , cd 9 ctober fnd, 1890, by General Brackenbmyfat that time lieaa ot the Intelligence Department at home. He pointed out that a remote corner °f Persia could not counterbalance the position of Russia m that country, would not help us in the least on the Afghan border -rr n , V'Y 1 ,’ ur and '-ould he of no use for assuming the offensive He concluded by saying-” By far the more important task is, not the 00 ^ struct ion of a new line into Seistan, but the consolidation of our power there by bringing the frontier tribes under our influence, and by developin'* Balu chistan and converting it into a fertile base of operations. When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia”. „• ff Gene J al Brackenhury’s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in his , arSmnmR was at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of a Seistan railway would he not to attack Russia in Northern Peisia, but to save Southern Persia from falling into her grasp, which could from°the re ^ ^ a ^ ^ Quetta ’ 0r ’ aS he ' VOuld M,:Ilsel£ P refer &gt; a liue r .r ■' 1 ' General Erackcnbury’s criticism was sent out to the Government of Indin, ^ and was thus noted upon by Sir G. Chesney on January 13th, 1891 Ihe railway can only be regarded as a work of military precaution. Prom this point of view it appears to me that the time cannot be far distant when it will be deemed necessary. Still more important is a railway from the Persian Gulf north to Seistan; but the connecting link between this line and the Quetta railway system will also be found necessary”. 2 o. A little later Sir H. Brackenbury, now Military Member in India v. 1 ? n i ) i • u P on the scheme; and it is interesting to read his remarks in the light of his former opinion. He now explained (April 27th, 1891) that he had only objected to a Seistan railway so long as the Bussian railway did not extend south of the Trans-Caspian line, and because to construct a rail wav to Seistan would compel her to make extensions. “ But if circumstances should change, and if Russia should take the lead in making rail wavs southward then it may become necessary for us to follow her lead. We ought to be able to keep pace with her ”.[ 8 ] 26. These conditions had not yet been realised, and the Government of India decided to proceed no further with the scheme. The question of a mow southerly line from the sea was at the same time considered m connection with Sir It. Sandeman’s proposals to take over Kej and Panjgur-a project which was revived in 189t by his successor, Sir J. Browne. On both occasions, how ever (as again at a liter date), the proposal to assume administrative respon sibility for Makran was negatived by the Government of India, and with it the idea of a Makran railway from the sea to Seistan was dropped also. Since then the question has not been revived. 27 It will be clear from the above narrative, firstly, that the idea of a Seistan railway does not appear to have ever been considered by the Govern ment of India from the only point of view m which, m my opinion it ought to be regarded, ms., as a protective, and not an offensive, measure, ffhe reason perhaps is that, at that time, Russia had not given such unmistakable evidence of her intention to move southward from Meshed, and to draw Seistan within the radius of her political influence. The railway was accordingly discussed and condemned, as a means of attacking Russia in Northern Persia, not as a means of keeping Russia out of Southern Persia. Moreover at that time, the Quetta-Seistan trade route not having yet been opened, the possible commer cial value of the line was not taken into account at all. Secondly, it will be noticed that the conditions postulated by Sir H. Brackenbury in London as precedent to any idea of railway construction in this quarter have since been realised. Baluchistan is rapidly being developed; the frontier tribes have passed com pletely under our control; a permanent line of communication with Seistan has been opened; while the very conditions which he said, when in India, might compel a change of attitude on our part— viz., Russian initiative in the process of southerly extension from her existing railway ^ system—have been fulfilled by the construction on her part, without provocation or incentive from us, of the Merv-Kushk line. It is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied; and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. 28. As regards the physical and engineering difficulties by which such a line might be confronted, I may cite the following opinion from the report in 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “ No one who has traversed this country can fail to be struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Nushki and Seistan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle exists to bar the road; throughout the gradient is exceedingly gentle; bands of sand can as a rule be avoided; of fuel there is an abundance; while not a bridge of more than one span, or engineering work of any magnitude, is requisite. Added to this the mineral wealth of the Koh-i-Sultan and the hills to the west, at present lying untouched, is so considerable as in itself to offer very great inducements to railway enterprise. Such a railway would place the trade of Eastern Persia and Seistan at our feet, unlock such Central Asian markets as are now closed, give us a preponderating influence in Eastern Persia, and opened to India the rich grain fields of Seistan ”. 29. It would appear, therefore, that so far as gradients, water-crossings, and fuel are concerned, little or no difficulty would be met with in laying a line across the 400 and odd miles that intervene between Nushki and Seistan. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that at present a very serious obstacle •would present itself in the complete dearth of water over long stretches of this route, and in the problem of the shifting sands. Both of these difficulties have been overcome by Russia, though only at great expense, and with the aid of a large permanent staff, upon her Trans-Caspian Railway. She has had, moreover, the assistance of a settled population and the advantage of numerous inhabited sites along the railway line. These advantages would, at any rate, at the start be wanting in the case of a Quetta-Seistan railway. Eor some time the trade by such a line, though it would probably develop with great rapidity, w^ould not be remunerative; while the railway would have no other immediate use.[ 9 J inasmuch as it would not be a line of connection between important centres of population, industry, or arms, but would, so to speak, end in the air If it stopped at the Anglo-Persian border, it would still be 90 miles distant from Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan. The chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to be problematical in view of the engagements against the intro duction ot railways, which Persia has allowed to be imposed upon her by Russia. The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would be required to pronounce; although, in the yearly increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. 30. The Government of India have in the accompanying despatch suggest ed the desirability of coming to an understanding with Russia concerning spheres of interest in Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone. In such a yase there might be no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Seistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promo tion of the resuscitated caravan route, and look forward to the day, when, the Hclmand being in our hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishing out post on the flanks of British India, that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. 31. Even in the event of such an understanding being declared impracti cable, while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then be bound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might be found to be one of these, I am yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso-Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence, before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles); and such an extension would afford no inconsiderable relief to the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing and, where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few days’ rest, from Nushki. But I should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which I am recommending in connection with the trade route, before I advocate even this advance. In a few years’ time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas, the execution of which would for the present be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. September 4th, 1899. CURZON of KEDLESTON. Foreign OfficeTresa—No.'9G5—15&gt;9-99—54.1899. SIMLA. FOREIGN EEE^lRTMENT. SECRET. External. Enclosure of a letter to Rer Majesty's Secretary of State for India, No. 175, dated the 21st September 1899.MINUTE by the VICEROY on SEISTAN, dated September 4 th, 1899. I propose, in this Minute, to examine the present aspect of the Seistan question in relation to our general policy towards Persia, and to the attitude of Russia in Persia. In my book on Persia, I wrote a chapter on Seistan (Vol. I, Chap. IX) which contained as full an account of that district, its history, inhabitants, features, and commercial and political significance, as was then (1892) procurable. I also discussed the political ambitions of Russia in con nection with Seistan (Vol. I, pages 201, 216-218, 235-244; Vol. II, pages 597- 598, 605), and the question of a possible Seistan Railway from India in the future (Vol. I, pages 237-214, 628-629). I ventured further to make certain recommendations, namely, that we should establish Consular or other represent ation (a) at Yezd, (5) at Kerman, (&lt;?) in Seistan, (d) at Bunder Abbas; (&lt;?) that the Kerman-Meshed trade route should be improved; (/) that a British trade route should be opened from Quetta to Seistan; (g ) that the question of railway extension in the direction of Seistan should be considered. Of these recommendations, I am glad to say that, during the interval that has since elapsed, (a), (5), (c), (e) and (/) have already been carried into execution. In the despatch with which this Minute is enclosed, (d) is recommended by the Government of India. I propose shortly to discuss the present aspect of (&lt;/). The references which have been given will dispense me from recapitulating the elementary facts about Seistan; and I may commence with an account of what has happened during the past 7 years, leading up to a description of the status quo. 2. Seistan was in 1892 a beluk or sub-division of the district of Kain (capital Birjand) which is a part of the province of Khorasan (capital Meshed). The Government of Kain has for long been in the hereditary possession of a powerful family of Arab origin, whose head bears the title of Amir of Kain, and who, until the centralising tendencies of recent years, exercised an authority almost independent of that of the Shah. Mir Alam Khan, who had filled the post for over a quarter of a century, died in 1891. For reasons into which it is not necessary to enter, the younger of his two sons, Ismail Khan, known as the Shaukat-ul-Mulk (now about 50 years of age), succeeded him as Governor of Kain at Birjand. The elder son, Ali Akbar Khan, known as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, became Governor of Tabbas and Seistan,—posts which he only retains by the process, familiar in Persia, of the annual payment of a large sum in cash to the Shah. The third son, Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, now just grown up, was made Sartip or Commandant of the Kain forces. The Shaukat- ul-Mulk and he have generally, but perhaps erroneously, been believed to incline towards Russia, whose aim has been to get Seistan, now to some extent separated from Kain, re-incorporated in it, and absorbed as an ordinary administrative district in the province of Khorasan. Such an amalgamation would emphasize the dependence of Seistan upon Meshed, from which it is now in some measure separate. 3. Meanwhile the elder brother, or Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has not himself resided in Seistan, but has deputed one of his sons, Mir Masum Khan, a fat and lethargic youth of about 18, to act as Deputy Governor at Nasirabad, under the tutelage of his mother, a lady with considerable powers of intrigue. This son is supposed to intrigue with the uncle at Birjand and is not on the best of terms with his father, who in 1898 sent an elder son, named Muhammad Reza Khan, to supersede him as Deputy Governor. Upon Mir Masum Khan declin- in 0, to go, the quarrel was patched up; and he still acts for his father in Seistan. Thus the local situation is that of Russia endeavouring to increase her hold uponL 2 ] the ruler of Kain (to whom she sent, a few weeks ago, a special mission con veying presents valued at £1,400); and the ruler of Kam endeavouring to oust his brother and to establish a hold upon Seistan himse . 4. Since the appointment of a British Consul-General a ~ es e (in consequence of a similar Russian appointment) m 18^ ® ls ^ ^^ included in the Consul’s jurisdiction, has been ,^ d r upon by British officers either from India or from Meshe . &gt; 1 . cfrnrlo-1 v visited it in 1892-93. Colonel Yate made a tour thither m B 9t, and stron 0 ly urged the appointment of a British Indian representative m Seistan, to balance the Russian native agent, whom he found exercising considerable influence. He enlarged upon the wheat-producing capabilities of Seistan, the cheapness of grain there as compared with the dearness outside, the ac van a 0 e o expor - ing the surplus supply to Quetta, the utility °f a postal service rom laman via Seistan to Meshed, in place of the Kandahar-Herat line; and he recom mended the construction of a line of wells and the planting o o\ y pos s rom Nushki to the Seistan border, so as to open a new caravan route for Indo- Persian trade. His report was shown to the Shah, who agreed witi Co onel Yate’s description of the political situation in Seistan, and, in so far as they concerned Persia, with his recommendations. The Government of India were, however, at that time under the impression, which has since been abandoned, that any evidence of British interest in Seistan or in Eastern Persia would merely bring down the Russians (who have come down without it), and would tempt them to extend their railway southwards (which they ha^ e since done independently of any British move). Accordingly Colonel Yate s proposals were rejected. 5. Two years later Captain McMahon, who had been employed upon the demarcation of the Baluch-Afghan boundary (in pursuance of the Durand Agree ment of 1893), submitted a memorandum to the Government of India (dated June 21st, 1896), in which he strongly recommended the opening of the route which had been negatived in 1894, and the adoption of proper measures for its protection, and for the exercise of political authority up to the Persian border. The Government of India accepted these proposals, and submitted them to the Secretary of State in a despatch, dated September 16th, ] 896. The latter replied on October 23rd, giving his sanction, and observing that—“ In the interest of the trade between India and Persia, it seems to me very desirable to further its development by this route”. In the ensuing month Lieutenant Webb M are was appointed Political Officer at Chageh, and was instructed to establish levy posts, and to take other steps for the prompt execution of the new scheme. 6. This officer started upon his first visit to Seistan in January and returned in June 1897. He found Russian influence much in evidence in Seistan, where he pleaded for the early installation of a British Agent. With regard to the commercial possibilities of Seistan, he reported that “ Seistan’s staple products are grain, ghi (clarified butter) and wool. If facilities for carriage were to be improved, it is by no means impossible that the future may see an extensive Perso-Baluch grain-trade called into existence”. Upon his outward, and again upon his return, journey, he took steps, by the opening of wells, by the building of guard-houses and godowns, and by the institution of levy posts, for the energetic promotion of the new trade route ; and he submitted a number of further proposals, with that object in view, to the Government of India. 7. Lieutenant Webb 'Ware’s visit to Seistan overlapped that of Surgeon- Major Brazier-Creagh, who in April of the same year was hurriedly despatched by the Government of India to Seistan, to carry out any plague precautions that might be required in that neighbourhood in anticipation of the preventive proceedings that Russia had announced her intention of putting into effect. His report testified to the great activity of Russia in Seistan, and contained a glowing and highly coloured picture of the capabilities of the country, which, with a somewhat proleptic fancy, he designated the Pearl of Persia. “ Being a rich grain-growing, large pasturage, camel and flock-rearing district, whose resources under proper control could be hugely increased, it might be turned-340 [ 3 ] into a regular garden He described the climate as far from bad, and the difficulties of access from Meshed as greater than those from Baluchistan. He thought that a large field was open for the import of green tea into Persia by the Nushki route ; and he strongly recommended the appointment of a native agent and assistant apothecary in Seistan. . A year later Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, Native Attache to the British Consulate at Meshed, and a very capable officer, was deputed to return to India by the new route, in the company of a trial caravan of Meshed merchants. Their journey lasted from April till July 1898—unfortunately the hottest and least propitious season of the year. At its close Maula Bakhsh, whose report is the best that I have yet read upon the country traversed, wrote that—“ The Indian traders with my caravan, although disappointed by losses of camels, difficulties of transport and want of water at certain places, have not formed an unfavourable view of the new trade route, and they intend to advise their firms to send goods by it in the future”. There were wanted, however, better arrangement for water-supply, more godowns, and superior provision for storing fodder. The road was pronounced not yet suitable for merchants, travellers, or pilgrims, unaccustomed to rough travelling. Never theless the journey from Meshed to Quetta—62 marches or 1,090 miles—was performed by Maula Bakhsh and his caravan in 65 days. Including the average number of halts, viz^ 10, he pointed out that the normal duration of the journey i.e., 72 days, would yet be shorter than the 75—90 days usually occupied in traversing the alternative route, 966 miles long, between Meshed and Bunder Abbas. 9. In the same year, 1898, Lieutenant Webb Ware submitted his first .Annual Report, which, in spite of the obstructive measures adopted by the Russian officers on the pretext of jfiague in Khorasan, recorded a gratil vin°* advance. _ In an appendix on Nushki trade, he pointed out that the route was growing in favour, and that out of nothing had been created a trade, which had risen from IJ lakhs in 1896 to Bs. 5,90,000 in 1897. The main impediments were the total lack of supplies, other than those specially imported, on the road between Nushki and the Seistan frontier, and the illegal extortion of the Persian toll-collectors (many of them in Russian pay) in Persian terri tory. Notwithstanding, he thought that the Quetta-Seistan route would even tually beat the Bunder Abbas route to Meshed, because merchandise carried by the latter required to change hands several times in transit, because a longer time was required for the journey thereby, and because the road was less secure than one running uninterruptedly through British territory. 10. . In the present year, the same officer’s second Annual Report testifies to a continued improvement both in the amenities of the route, and in the trade returns, which have increased by Rs. 1,38,000 since 1897. A new bazar, containing 126 shops, has been laid out at Nushki, which has developed from a petty group of daub and wattle huts into a small town; and which, now that the Nushki district has been (in the summer of 1899) permanently taken over by the Government of India, is certain of a prosperous future. Through out the past year a weekly dak has been maintained from Quetta to the Seistan frontier, in correspondence with a bi-weekly Persian dak from thence via Nasirabad and Birjand to Meshed. Alterations and short cuts in the route have reduced the distance from Nushki to Meshed to 951 miles, as compared with 966 miles from Bunder Abbas to the same destination. 11. An independent light has been thrown upon Seistan in the same period by the visit of Captain Sykes, who was despatched thither as Consul at the end of 1898 in consequence of the appointment of a Russian Consul to Nasirabad. Captain Sykes, who has for some time been Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, and who has been greatly interested in the rival Bunder Abbas- Kerman-Meshed trade route, arrived in Seistan in January 1899, with pre possessions already so strongly formed in favour of the older route, and against the new competitor, that before he had been there a week, he pronounced against the permanent appointment of a Political Officer to Seistan, and in[ 4 ] favour of his own return to Kerman. He was also in a position to say that “ the 0 nett a route (which he had never seen) is hopelessly handicapped by its natural Svanta-es’h These and other conclusions of Captain Sykes were vigorously disputed by Colonel Temple, our Agent and Consul-General at Meshed. But they are not without their value, as showing the reverse side of the shield to that which has perhaps, with a pardonable optimism, been displayed by the various officers who have been concerned in the inception or development tie enterpise from the Indian side. In subsequent letters, Captain Sykes reiterated his opinions as to the superiority in respect of water, camel-grazing and sup- plies of the Bunder Aftbas route; but so far receded rom Ins original attitude as to admit that there was a great opening on the Indian route tor impoits of tea and indigo, and that on political grounds its opening was important, adding, “ The larger the parties that visit Seistan and the more frequently they appear, the greater the political effect will be On February 14th, he explained ‘‘how necessary it is to provide the funds, by the careful expenditure of vlncli .beistan may be brought nearer to India ”, and urged that “ it is of paramount import, ance to take advantage of the proximity of our frontiers and not to allow Russian trade and influence to be pushed to our very door . On April J 8th, while adhering to his views about the superiority of the Bunder Abbas road over the Indian route, he nevertheless remarked that “the Seistams generally, and the Baluchis in particular, all look towards the East and South, while their local commerce is now mainly carried on with Quetta , and that the rc’vi'val of the Seistan-Quetta route, the buildings erected along it and the other proofs of British activity, have helped to increase our prestige He now advocated placing a smart Muhammadan native agent in Seistan . to supcivise the post which I earnestly hope will be made permanent , and in a latci letter, on Hay 11th, he urged “ the establishment of an Indian Post Office at Birjand, as well as in Seistan, with a competent news-writer for each district which “modest scheme should be sanctioned and carried out without delay In the last letter received from him, dated June 1st, Captain Sykes expressed his final opinion as adverse to the appointment of a British Consul for Kain and Seistan, unless a Russian Consul were sent (in which case it would become obligatory). It will be seen, therefore, from a synopsis of Captain Sykes’s reports, that, while he remains unfavourable to the prospects of the Quetta-Seistan route, as compared with the old trans-Persian road, he has come round to the opinion, which no previous traveller in Seistan has questioned, that it is essential that British interests, commercial and political, should be sustained in that quarter by an energetic and liberal maintenance of the line of connec tion with India, but that, for their support in Seistan itself, it will be sufficient for the present, unless a more active course be imposed by Russian initiative, to rely upon Indian native agents. These recommendations I have accepted in the draft despatch to the Secretary of State. I should add that Colonel Temple, who has throughout disputed many of Captain Sykes’s statements and dissented from his conclusions—partly owing to a not unfounded suspicion that Captain Sykes was advising in a spirit of undue independence of Meshed— has urged, in view of the recent renewal of plague alarms in Eastern Persia, that a native agent, if sent from India, should be a medical officer, charged in addition with the necessary political work. Although I believe these alarms to have been factitious, and to have been fomented by Russia for political purposes in 1899, as in 1897, I have so far acted upon Colonel Temple’s advice as to send a Hospital Assistant from Quetta to Seistan as news-writer and medical reporter for a period of 6 months. Such is the present state of our information, and of affairs, in Seistan. 12. It will be seen from what I have written that Seistan is, by virtue of its position and its features, an object of much interest both to Russia and Great Britain. Situated at the point of junction of the frontiers of Persia, Afghan istan, and Baluchistan, its future affects the destinies of all three countries. Lying, as it does, almost midway between Meshed and the Persian Gulf, no advance can be made from Khorasan to the sea except through Seistan. Its position upon the exposed flank of Afghanistan would render its occupation ofr c SAT) [ 5 ] gi'eat value to any Power contemplating either a move against that country, or an advance upon Kandahar Nor will it be denied that the Kandahar-Herat line could not be held with safety by India, nor the valley of the Helmand defended, were a hostile Power m possession of Seistan. Furthermore, the grain- producing capabilities of the district, to the bygone richness of which eloquent testimony is borne by the immense number of ruined cities encumbering the sod, and which could without serious difficulty be revived by a scientific employ ment of the waters of the Helmand, render Seistan of much value, as a possible granary, either to a 1 pwer engaged upon a forward advance, or to a Power interested in commercial and industrial expansion. n 'i'll i? 10 ^ orce these circumstances has, it will have been observed, com pelled the Government of India to display a concern in Seistan, which, at the start, they were most reluctant to acknowledge, and which, at varying intervals since, they have, with unconscious inconsistency, affected to repudiate. I have already cited the reply returned to Colonel Yate in 1894. Between 1894 and 1898 the jN ushki-Seistan trade route was, with the sanction and upon the encourage ment of the Secretary of State, deliberately opened by the Government^ India ; a Political Officer was appointed to administer the district between iNushki and the Persian border; officers were repeatedly despatched to report upon the country and to evince an interest in its fortunes. And yet as recently as August 10th, 1898, the Government of India in writing to the Secretary of State referred to the apprehensions of Lord Dufferin’s Government in 1887 that activity in the direction of Seistan might lead to a forward move on the part of Bussia”; and gave it as their opinion that “premature activity was likely to prevent or postpone the future success of the new route from Quetta to Seistan , \ .14. I am quite unable to understand either the force of this logic or the consistency of this conduct. The cautious and, in its motive, praiseworthy abstention of the Government of India from displaying any interest in Seistan did not for one moment affect the designs, or retard the advance of Bussia in that direction. Bussian news-writers wore firmly established in the district before anything more than a casual visit had been paid by a British officer. While members of the Government of India wore writing notes to show that, if even a caravan route were opened from Quetta in the direction of Seistan, the Bussians would extend their trans-Caspian Bailway southwards, the latter were already at work, laying their rails from Merv to the Kushk post, and preparing the plant for an ultimate extension to Herat. Sir M. Durand’ in a paragraph of his recent despatch, has exposed the hollowness of this plea, and I venture to hope that it may not figure again in our reasoning. 15. Similarly, I am unable to comprehend how—the trade route bavin 0, been delibeiately opened any activity in developing it can either be premature, or can possibly prevent or postpone hopes which the trade route itself has’ been called into existence to realise, and which, without it, would have had no being. Either the Nushki-Seistan trade route is a bona-fide enterprise, upon which we have designedly embarked, in the main, because of its commercial possibilities, but also not without an eye to the extreme political importance of Seistan; or it is a fortuitous and foolish experiment, not likely or intended to succeed. In the latter case let us be wise and drop it. In the former let us be honest, and make the best job of it that we can. 16. I have no hesitation in recommending the last named course: and I do so, not because I am carried away by the gratifying, though modest, achieve ments of the new trade route up to date, nor because I contemplate for it an early and brilliant success. On the contrary I regard the obstacles and difficul ties as considerable; and, knowing the traditional conservatism of the East, I recognise that commerce will not readily be diverted into a new, and, at first sight, somewhat unattractive channel. But I urge a strenuous continuation of the venture, with an eye to a twofold contingency, political and commercial, in the future. 17. In the first place if we do not continue to show an active interest in Seistan, Bussia will. If we do not give the impression there of preponderant[ 6 ] influence, Russian authority will soon supplaut ouw.^ cordons or otherwise, the N for Indian trade to Khorasan; ‘tbemostTrcct 5 ^ her paths^ Looking h. be ou^ oWt to draw the Une of demarcation between the Russian an d the British spheres at the point'best suited to our interests, and not to 'ors- Thekome dndnets o Khorasan end with Turbat-i-Haidan, 80 miles south of Meshed. Ihey wiU doubtless follow the fortunes of the capital. . 18 South of this district comes that of Kam already possessing a semi-independent chiefship, which might very well be retained as a buffer Seen the opposing spheres. Seistan should, for all the reasons given be included in the British sphere of interest. It is no exaggeration to say that we cannot afford to see it excluded. 19. Secondly, a study of the history and features of Seistan no less than of all modern reports upon it, leads to the conclusion that the future of that country will depend, as did its past, upon the proper employment of the immense water-supply from the Helmand that now runs not and goes to waste in vast lagoons, and reed-beds, and swamps. The greater part of Seistan is, during several months in the year, under inundation. Captain Sykes, in one of his letters, has estimated its present population at 60,000. In another, he has said that, under a proper system of irrigation, the land would support “ perhaps a tenfold population ” In a third he has said that, if the Helmand were properly controlled, the population might rise to a million or more. It is clear, therefore, that the future of Seistan will lie with those who control the entire course ot the Helmand. It should be in their power to turn the desert into a garden, and to make the wilderness blossom like a rose. 20. Now it can hardly he doubted that a day will come, when, in response to an external challenge, Great Hritain will he obliged to advance to Kandahar. So fully is this probability admitted, that the arrangements for the advance, including the rails, the mobilisation camp, and the water-supply at Chaman have already been made. When Kandahar is re-occupied, the valley of the Helmand will he occupied with it. Then will come the time, when the channel and the valley of that river, now running parallel to the British border, though at no great distance from it, having passed under British control, the regenera tion of Seistan will for the first time become practicable, and it will be possible to revive its former fame as one of the granaries of that part of Asia. No wise man can he anxious to precipitate or even to hasten that consummation. But on the other hand no wisdom in the world can greatly retard it; and when the hour strikes, it would seem to me to be as well that Seistan should be waiting to he regenerated by us, instead of having already been absorbed in the regen erative embraces of others. 21. Tor these reasons, I recommend that in the intervening years, the Government of India should continue, by constant, hut unpretentious, activity in fostering the trade route, in providing for its security, and in reducing its discomforts, and by a steady assertion of British authority up to the borders of Seistan and of British influence within it,—to build up an interest in Seistan which shall save for India an area and a market of so much potential value. With this object I urge that we should he 'willing to spend a little money—it will amount at the most to only a few thousand pounds—upon a venture that would he defensible, even if it were doomed to failure, but that appears, on the contrary, to he attended with reasonable hopes of success. 22. There remains only to be considered the question of a possible railway connection between India and Seistan. This question has been discussed at intervals during the past 12 years, and the history of the discussion is not without its lessons for the future. The first idea of some such railway appears to have originated with the late Sir J. Browne, who, as early as 1884, advocated a line[ 7 ] from the neighbourhood of Quetta via Nushki, not to Seistan, but to Safar on the Helmand. lias proposal was put forward, without any reference to Persia, ioi strategical reasons, namely, in order to prevent, at any future period, a Russian advance upon Kandahar. It is interesting to me to learn from a study of the papers, what I did not know before, viz., that five years later, when I was travelling in Persia, and was first writing about this question, it had iust been raised both in India and in Persia by a report from Colonel Bell, at that time head of the Intelligence Department in India, who in the autumn of 1888 marched from India by Kharan and Mashkel to Seistan, and strongly recommended the construction of a railway, and a lease in perpetuity of Seistan fiom the 1 ersian Gov ernment, with a view to the grant of a great irrigation concession to Reuter or to some other Company. The suggestion was eagerly taken up by Sir H. D. Wolff, whose imagination was at that time suffused°with halcyon dreams of a regeneration of Persia by universal railways; and was recommended by him both to the Government of India and to Lord Salisburv. Lord Lansdowne’s Government in a telegram, dated January 20th, 1889, said that “ Railway extension through Baluchistan was regarded by the military authorities as a most valuable adjunct to the defences of India and as deserving of the utmost encouragement”. Sir H. Wolff’s proposals did not make much advance, but were reiterated by him in despatches to the Foreign Office, dated July 25th, and August 19th, 1890. Unfortunately in these, as in his original despatch of February 19th, 1889, Sir II. Wolff rested Ins defence of the scheme upon extremely contentious and entirely unacceptable grounds. He advocated it for two reasons: as a menace to the Trans-Caspian Railway of Russia, and as the saving of a long land march in the event of our desiring to take the offensive against that Power. This line of argument was completely riddled in a Memorandum, dated October 2nd, 1890, by General Brackenbury, at that time Head of the Intelligence Department at home. He pointed out that a single line to a remote corner of Persia could not counterbalance the position of Russia in that country, would not help us in the least on the Afghan border or in Afghan-Turkistan, and would be of no use for assuming the offensive. He concluded by saying—“ By far the more important task is, not the con struction of a new line into Seistan, but the consolidation of our power there by bringing the frontier tribes under our influence, and by developing Balu chistan and converting it into a fertile base of operations. When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia”. 23. General Brackenbury’s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in his own argument was at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of a Seistan railway would be not to attack Russia in Northern Persia, but to save Southern Persia from falling into her grasp, which could be done either by a line from Quetta, or, as he would himself prefer, by a line from the sea. 24. General Brackenbury’s criticism was sent out to the Government of India, and was thus noted upon by Sir G. Chesney on January 13th, 1891— “ The railway can only be regarded as a work of military precaution. From this point of view it appears to me that the time cannot be far distant when it will be deemed necessary. Still more important is a railway from the Persian Gulf north to Seistan; but the connecting link between this line and the Quetta railway system will also be found necessary”. 25. A little later Sir H. Brackenbury, now Military Member in India, again noted upon the scheme; and it is interesting to read his remarks in the light of his former opinion. He now explained (April 27th, 1891) that he had only objected to a Seistan railway so long as the Russian railway did not extend south of the Trans-Caspian line, and because to construct a railway to Seistan would compel her to make extensions. “ But if circumstances should change, and if Russia should take the lead in making railways southward, then it may become necessary for us to follow her lead. We ought to be able to keep pace with her[ 8 ] 26. These conditions had not yet he sdienle _ The que stion o£ a more India decided to proceed no further „ cons id er ed in connection witli southerly line from the se ®_^ t a * take over Kej and Panjgur-a project which Sir E.

It is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied; and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. 28 As regards the physical and engineering difficulties by which such a line mi edit he confronted, I may cite the following opinion from the report m 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “ No one who has traversed this country can fail to be struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Nushki and Seistan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle exists to bar the road; throughout the gradient is exceedingly gentle; bands of sand can as a rule be avoided; of fuel there is an abundance; while not a bridge of more than one span, or engineering work of any magnitude, is requisite. Added to this the mineral wealth of the Koh-i-Sultan and the hills to the west, at present lying untouched, is _ so considerable as in itself to offer very great inducements to railway enterprise. Such a railway would place the trade of Eastern Persia and Seistan at our feet, unlock such Central Asian markets as are now closed, give us a preponderating influence in Eastern Persia, and opened to India the rich grain fields of Seistan ”. 29. It would appear, therefore, that so far as gradients, water-crossings, and fuel are concerned, little or no difficulty would be met with in laying a line across the 400 and odd miles that intervene between Nushki and Seistan. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that at present a very serious obstacle would present itself in the complete dearth of water over long stretches of this route, and in the problem of the shifting sands. Both of these difficulties have been overcome by Russia, though only at great expense, and with the aid of a large permanent staff, upon her Trans-Caspian Railway. She has had, moreover, the 3 assistance of a settled population and the advantage of numerous inhabited sites along the railway line. These advantages would, at any rate, at the start be wanting in the case of a Quetta-Seistan railway. Eor some time the trade by such a line, though it would probably develop with great rapidity, -would not be remunerative; while the railway would have no other immediate use.[ 9 I inasmuch as it would not he a line of connection between important centres of population industry or arms, but would, so to speak, end in the air. If it stopped at the Anglo-1 ersian border, it -would still he 90 miles distant from Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan.. Ihe chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to be problematical in view of the engagements against the intro duction id railways, which lersia has allowed to be imposed upon her by Russia The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would be required to pronounce; although, in the yearly increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. 30. The Government of India have in the accompanying despatch suggest ed the desirability of coming to an understanding with Hussia concerning spheres of interest in Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone In such a case there might be no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Scistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promo tion of the resuscitated caravan route, and look forward to the day, when, the Helmand being in oui hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishiD fj&gt; out post on the flanks of British India, that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. 31. Even in the event of such an understanding being declared impracti cable, while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then be bound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might be found to be one of these, I am. yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso-Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence, before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles); and such an extension would afford no inconsiderable relief to the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing and, where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few days’ rest, from Nushki. But I should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which I am recommending in connection with the trade route, before I advocate even this advance. In a few years’ time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas, the execution of which would for the present be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. September 4th, 1899.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. % FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Eight Hon’ble LORD GEORGE E. HAMILTON, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India* Simla, the 21st September 1899. My Lord, We desire to address Your Lordship and, through Your Lordship, Her Majesty’s Government on the subject of the relations of Great Britain with Persia. We might find an adequate reason for so doing in the fact that Your Lordship in your despatch of June 30th, 1899, enclosing a copy of a recent despatch to the Foreign Office from Sir M. Durand, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, concerning the maintenance of our influence in Persia, has directly invited an expression of the views of the Government of India upon this matter; and, while calling our attention to the desirability of improv ing the Political and Consular Service in that country, has at the same time stated your desire to be made acquainted with our opinions upon the remaining questions discussed by Sir M. Durand. But, in any case, we should have felt it our duty at an early date to address Your Lordship on the subject. Although the relations of Great Britain with Persia have for a period of exactly a century occupied a large, and perhaps at times a disproportionate, space upon the field of international diplomacy ; although during that time Great Britain has twice broken off diplomatic relations and has once been at war with Persia in vindication of British interests in or upon the borders of that country; and, although large sums of money have been throughout the present century and are still annually expended in the maintenance of those interests, both by Her Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India, we have not been able to discover in our records any clear definition of the principles upon which our policy towards the Persian kingdom is based, of the objects which it should keep in view, or of the scope and limits of the respective shares of responsibility, political and financial, which should be assumed by the two partners, viz., Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who are jointly concerned in the defence of Anglo-Indian interests in the dominions of the Shah. 2. We feel that there is at the present time the greater need for such a discussion, because of the facts, which must be patent to all, that the Persian Government appears well nigh to have exhausted all power of recuperation or reform; and that the country, but feebly held together by any tie either of race, religion, or loyalty, is only saved from a fate to which it must otherwise have long ago succumbed, partly by a superficial vitality not infrequently seen in political organisms, especially in the East, even when in an advanced stage of decay, still more by the rival ambitions of the two great European Powers between whom its territories are placed, and who are the real arbiters of its[ 2 ] destiny, These conditions have « dispkyed^duraM^ m a priori expectations, and they may y fpov cannot in the sSs s municated, and the already shattered structure tumbles into irretrievable ruin. 3. We think that there are signs that such an issue, if not immediately iTYvnpndino- in Persia is drawing near. The rule of the present Shah is distinctly and uniformly weaker than that of his predecessor. The dissolvent agencies at work in fhe Persian kingdom are more active and persistent. Meanu n e, the encroachments of Russian power are steadfastly pursued aud are less veiled by anv pretence of coucealment. Other Governments and nationalities, either impelled by the secret obligations of international sympathies, or attracted by a desire to share in the probable spoils, are appearing upon the scene; and there is every reason to believe that, as in the case of the Ottoman Empire an of China, so also here, the property of the sick man, should no steps be ta en in advance to prolong his existence, and should the end come before any testamentary dispositions have been made, is likely to be subject of bitter contention between the various parties who may demand to be included among his heirs. 4 We desire, therefore, not merely to examine, in response to Your Lordship’s invitation, the particular steps that may require to be taken for the maintenance or extension of British interests in Persia at the present juncture, but to survey a wider field, and, while there is yet time, to discuss how those interests should be definitely safeguarded m the future that seems to be imminent, and what part in the outlay or m the measures that may be necessitated for that end, should be assumed respectively by Her Majesty s Government and by the Government of India. Sir M. Durand himself concludes his despatch by saying that “ the time has come for us to lay down a definite line of policy”. We concur in this opinion, but we interpret the obligation thus admitted in a broader sense than Her Majesty’s Minister has done * and we think that no mere stop-gap measures, however useful they may individually be, will avail for the permanent protection of our position in Persia, unless a clear understanding be arrived at in advance as to what that position is and what it demands. 5. It may not be inappropriate to state, in the first place, what we conceive British, i&lt;?., Anglo-Indian, interests in Persia to be. They are com mercial, political, strategical and telegraphic. The total annual value of British trade with Persia has been estimated by Sir M. Durand (and, from the calculations that we have made, we believe the estimate to be below the mark) as approximately three and-a-half millions sterling; and while a great deal of this trade, particularly in the south and east, is with British India, yet the northern and western avenues of entry are devoted in the main to commercial connections with the British Isles. The total volume of Anglo-Persian trade continues, in spite of the difficulties encountered and the increasing insecurity in Persia, to rise and, under a more efficient and less venal regime, would probably attain to much larger dimensions. Similarly, although the experience of the past decade has not been encouraging to British mercantile investment in Persia, as the experience of the Tobacco Regie, the Persian Mining Rights Company, and other ventures, has shown, there is nevertheless a good deal of British capital sunk in various industrial undertakings in different parts of the country. 6. The political interests of Great Britain in Persia, although they date originally from a period before India had become a British interest at all, were, in their revival a century ago, in the main Indian in inception, and are still largely Indian in character. It would be unfair, however, at the present day to[ 3 ] attribute to them an exclusively Indian complexion. Ever since tbe first visit of tbe late Shah to Europe, Persia has been drawn increasingly into the vortex of European politics. Neither France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Holland, nor Belgium own possessions contiguous to the Persian dominions. Their commercial stake in the country is relatively small. Notwithstanding they find it to their interest to maintain, what are in some cases costly and extensive, diplomatic establishments at Tehran, and they occupy a minor, but nevertheless a definite, position upon the local diplomatic stage. It is to be surmised, therefore, that, even had British India not existed, or had it passed into other hands, the British Government would nevertheless before now have been compelled to take an active political interest in Persian fortunes. Persia is in fact one of those countries which, whether or not they had fallen into the orbit of Western Powers, more vigorous than themselves, must inevitably have attracted the attention of Europe, partly from their increasing infirmity, but still more from the opportunities suggested by their latent, though neglected, sources of strength. The two-fold British interest and responsibility here indicated have indeed been recognised by the system, now of long standing, under which the charges of the diplomatic establishment maintained by Her Majesty’s Govern ment at Tehran are shared between the Imperial and the Indian Exchequers. That such a division of common interest has become necessary, that the politics of Tehran, which with one eye turned towards India looks with the other towards St. Petersburgh and Constantinople, are but one aspect of the eternal Eastern question, and that the control of British diplomacy at Tehran must therefore be vested in the hands of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, are propositions which 40 years ago were hotly contested by certain schools of thought, but that will not any longer be a matter of dispute. They serve to illustrate the Imperial, as distinct from the purely Indian, character of Anglo- Persian relations. 7. The strategical interests of Great Britain in Persia arise from conditions with which India is most intimately concerned. Long before the boundaries of British India had been extended to their present limits, or before Russia had become a great Central Asian Power, approaching or impinging at many points upon the Indian frontiers, the fortunes of Persia, though not at that time a coterminous country, had become a matter of vital concern to the British dominion in India. In the early years of the present century, when the ambi tions of France were the main source of apprehension, it was through Persia that a blow at British supremacy was expected to be struck, and that an inva sion of India was planned. The same idea has re-appeared at intervals since. Now that the boundaries of Afghanistan, which have been demarcated and guaranteed by Great Britain, march for many hundreds of miles with those of Persia; that Persian territory is also coterminous for hundreds of miles with Baluchistan, a State under a British Protectorate, and in large measure actually administered by the officers of the Government of India; and that the sea which washes the southern coasts of Persia is one in which, both from its proximity to the Indian Ocean and as a result of the exertions of the past century, Indian interests and influence have become supreme—it is clear that Persia has assumed a strategical importance, in relation to British India, which might not be serious, were the resources or the designs of that country itself alone to be considered; but which is indisputably great, when it is remembered that closely pressing upon Persia and upon Afghanistan is the ever-growing momentum of a Power whose interests in Asia are not always in accord with our own, and that the Persian Gulf is beginning to attract the interest of other and some times rival nations. These conditions, however, while they indicate the supreme concern which those who are responsible for the government of India cannot fail to feel in the fortunes of Persia, are nevertheless sufficiently obvious in their general application to render it unnecessary for us to point out their far more than local range, or to argue that they affect not merely the destinies of British dominion in India, but those of the British Empire. It is from this point of view that we hold strongly the opinion that Persia in its strategical, no less than in its political, aspect is not only an Indian, but is also an Imperial,[ 4 ] concern, and that we feel no hesitation in appealing to Her Majesty’s Government for a frank and generous recognition of this common responsibility. 8. The telegraphic interests of Great Britain in Persia may he said to he evenly divided between the mother-country and India. For whilst on the one hand the wires that have been constructed between the north-west frontier and Tehran, and which provide the earlier link in the Persian section of the main overland connection with the East, are in the hands of a Company whose domicile is in London, from Tehran onwards to the Gulf the undeitaking is conducted by an establishment that is recruited and paid for by the Govern ment of India, while its head-quarters are in the India Office in London. This two-fold system exists in order to maintain a connection^ which may be said to he equally British and Indian, since it is equally indispensable to the interests of both countries; hut which also has an ulterior and wider scope, inasmuch as the Trans-Persian wires, and the sub-marine cables by which they are supplemented in the Persian Gulf, are largely utilised for the conveyance of messages between Great Britain and places lying beyond India, notably the Australasian Colonies. From a calculation based upon the aggregate results of the past five years, we have ascertained that no less than 30 per cent of the total traffic is of this description. Nevertheless the cost, in so far as it is borne by either Government, devolves exclusively upon the Indian, and not upon the Home, Exchequer. 9. Such are the main interests of Great Britain in Persia. It will be observed that the shares that may he claimed by the mother-country and by India in the sum total of those interests, have in the passage of time become so interwoven and fused as to render the task of separating or distinguishing them neither easy nor profitable. It may not be difficult, as we shall endeavour to argue later on, to distinguish between sources of expenditure which should more properly fall to the charge of the one or the other partner. But we maintain that enough has been said to prove that on the broad field of international policy Persia is not exclusively an Indian interest, but is emphatically an Imperial interest of Great Britain ; and that the latter should be prepared to exert her full strength for the defence of that interest, should it be jeopardised or impugned. 10. In discussing the manner in which it is desirable that these principles, if accepted, should be carried into action, w r e are anxious at the outset to make our position, in one respect, perfectly clear. We have no desire to make an addition to the political or territorial responsibilities of India, for which we have not, under existing conditions, the means either in money or in men. We are not about to propose that there should be established any Protectorate, open or covert, over any part of the Shah’s dominions, that might compel us in the future to hold the country so protected by force of arms. We can conceive of circumstances that might some day tempt both the Indian and the Home Governments from this attitude of reserve, and that would in a case where the vital interests of the Empire were at stake, force us to consider a burden for which our shoulders are still unprepared. But for the present our ambitions are exclusively limited to making secure the interest which we have already built up, and still more to preventing it from being undermined or taken from us by others, with the result not only of a considerable accretion of strength to them, but of positive detriment to ourselves. We have, in fine, no desire to disturb the political status quo in Persia so long as it can be maintained. We prefer indeed, weak as it is, to invest it with such renewed vitality as may be found possible. But we press for an early decision and for early action, since, unless w T e bestir our selves, there is good reason for fearing that the already trembling balance may he disturbed by others to our disadvantage. . , n( i w P roce ed to draw a picture of the present state of British in crests m Persia, as they present themselves to our eyes, and to examine the dangers by which they appear to he threatened. Sir M. Durand has to a cer- am ex ent anticipated us in this task ; and in so far as he has touched upon ^ e same ground as that which we propose to cover, we shall not recapitulate[ 5 ] what he has said. On the other hand, we think that we are in a position to fill in the outlines of his sketch with a good deal of additional detail; and it will he our duty to discuss the situation from the standpoint more particularly of those Indian interests, of which we are the constituted guardians. 12. The political destinies of a country and a Government, as weak as we have stated those of Persia to be, are likely to be determined in the main by her geographical position in relation to her neighbours. Of the four foreign Powers whose territories adjoin her own, two may be eliminated from the present discussion as being themselves lacking in the strength or vitality, likely to render their influence decisive, or their aggression to be feared. These are Turkey and Afghanistan, the latter of which, moreover, is under engagements with Great Britain that render it impossible for her to be considered, in her foreign relations, as an independent Power. There remain Russia and Great Britain. There is a curious correspondence, but there are also notable differ ences, between the positions of these two Powers vis a vis with Persia. The entire northern frontier of Persia is now contiguous with Prussian territory, with the exception of that portion which borders upon the Caspian Sea—a distinction, but not a difference, inasmuch as that sea has to all intents and purposes been converted into a Russian lake. Russian territory also overlaps the north-east corner of the Persian dominions. Great Britain enjoys a some what similar preponderance of influence on the south, by virtue of her hitherto unchallenged supremacy, both naval and commercial, in the Persian Gulf; while, owing to recent developments on the side of Baluchistan, her land territories also touch those of Persia upon the south-east. But there are these broad differences between the two positions: firstly, that whereas the Russian territories that are limitrophe with Persia on the north are continuous either with those of European or with those of Asiatic Russia, the immense resources of both of which dominions can be brought by a skilfully designed system of railways, and deposited with little trouble and with no delay, upon the Persian frontier itself—the forces of Great Britain, if required for purposes either of menace or attack, would require to be conveyed by sea and would be separated by a great distance from their base; the land connection on the Perso-Baluch side being as yet too precarious and remote to admit of its being taken into serious consideration in the present context; secondly, that whereas the Russian land approaches upon the north are in her own exclusive possession, the maritime access of Great Britain on the south is equally open to any other Power possessing a naval marine. Hence the marked and inevitable distinction between the power of persuasion or menace possessed by Russia in the north, as compared with that at the disposal of Great Britain in the south, the advantage enjoyed by the former being enhanced by the fact that the Persian capital and Court are situated in the northern or Russian and not in the southern or British zone of influence. 13. In these circumstances it is not surprising to read of the increasing and indisputable supremacy which Russia has established in Northern Persia, as described by Sir M. Durand. While not repeating his demonstration, we may supplement it by saying that, while we think that no efforts should be spared to safeguard so much as is left to us of the trade that enters the country by the Trebizond-Tabriz route, of the trade of Tehran, and of that of North- East Persia (concerning which it may be noted that the imports into Meshed from British India wEich in 1893-91 represented a value of £198,500 and in 1894-95 of £312,000, have in 1897-98 sunk to £130,000), and while as long as the capital remains at Tehran, which is also the centre of important British interests in the shape of the Telegraph administration and the Imperial Bank of Persia, it is essential that British influence there should be asserted on a scale as nearly as possible equivalent to that of Russia—we are yet of opinion that the advantages enjoyed by Russia in the field under discussion are so over whelming as to render any attempt to dispute or to shake her position there fruitless; and that our own energies can with greater wisdom and with superior chances of success be directed towards the protection and consolidation of the[ e ] British sphere of influence in the centre and south. It is to a more critical examination of this subject that we now turn. 14. Sir M. Durand has in his despatch drawn a line across Persia from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier on the west, through Kcrmanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Scistan and the Afghan frontier on the east, as indicating approximately the existing line of partition between the British and liussian spheres of influence both political and commercial in Persia. 15. following the same order from the west, we concur with what he has written about the importance of fostering the Baghdad trade route via Kerman- shah to Tehran, British commerce by which approaches in value to £1,000,000 per annum. This is a route of peculiar value both to British and to Indian trade, and one upon which we should on no account forfeit the supremacy. We have no hesitation in recommending, with Sir M. Durand, the substitution of a British Vice-Consul at Kermanshah for the present native agent: although we think that the cost of the proposed appointment which lies outside of what may be called the more strictly Indian zone, and which will be subordinate to the Consulate-General at Tehran, should be borne by Imperial and not by Indian revenues. 16. Whatever be the prospects of opening up, either by road or by railway (and concerning the latter we are sceptical), the country that lies northward of the Karun River, and that is inhabited by the Lurs and other nomad tribes, it is certain that British influence has obtained a material foothold in that corner of the Shah’s dominions, through which the Karun flows in its middle and lower course, and where the road now being constructed through the Bakhtiari country, by contract between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and Messrs. Lynch, should open an alternative and almost exclusively British door of commercial access to Ispahan. We do not express any opinion as to the ideas which Sir M. Durand has more than once put forward as to the desirability of raising a local irregular force under British officers from the tribes in tin's part of Persia. Such a scheme would appear to postulate a firmer and more permanent footimr than we have as yet established in South-West Persia. Nevertheless we think that no opportunity should be lost of strengthening our influence with the Arab, Bakhtiari and Lur tribes—an effort to challenge which from a rival quarter appears likely before long to be made—and we concur in Sir M. Durand’s recommendations as to the desirability of establishing a Consulate on the Karun, reserving for a subsequent jxrragrapli our opinion as to the proper incidence of the cost. 17. Continuing in an easterly direction, we have noticed from the recent Consular Report of Mr. J. R. Preece, Her Majesty’s Consul at Ispahan, that “ British trade in Ispahan has shown during the last two years, if not an absolute decrease, at all events no expansion whatever ”, while great strides have been made in Russian importations, notably of glassware and hardware. We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that the British Consul should be raised in respect of title and pay to the same level as the recently arrived Russian representative, although, as this is a matter which mainly concerns the English Foreign Office, we are not clear that we are called upon to advise upon the subject. Me cannot, however, too strongly emphasise our opinion that in any partition either of commercial or political spheres of influence in Persia, Ispahan, the old (and, if Persia should ultimately break up, possiblv a future) capital, the seat of the Sefavi dynasty, the principal market of Central Persia, and (tar more than Tehran) the focus of Persian nationality, must on every ground, be included in the zone in which British interests are supreme. 18. Me also concur with Sir M. Durand in thinking that British interests are most inadequately represented at Shiraz by the present native agent who is a nonentity, without influence or power; and that the experiment of brino-in^ the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who is also Consul-General for Ears, to reside[ 7 ] during the summer at the capital of the province, which is within his official area of jurisdiction, should he given a further trial. Colonel Wilson in 1895 and Colonel Meade in 1898 spent the summer months at Shiraz, but were compelled to hire house accommodation at their own expense. If these visits are made recurrent, we are inclined to think that, as no suitable house appears to be open cither to purchase or to rent, a site should be purchased and a house erected thereon. To this suggestion also we will revert. Shiraz is a place of considerable importance; and were it not for the great influence that has for long been exercised there by the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, British interests must have suffered from the neglect to which they have hitherto been exposed. 19. The districts lying to the east of Ispahan and Shiraz contain the important cities and trade-centres of Yezd and Kerman, connected by one of the principal postal and caravan tracks of Persia. Both of these towns and districts lie south of the natural line of division between Northern and Southern Persia; and in both British commercial and political influence has, in recent years, been actively vindicated. In September 1893, Mr. Eergusson, the Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank, was appointed unpaid Vice- Consul at Yezd. Sir M. Durand now suggests that a Vice-Consul, if appointed to Bunder Abbas, might pass his summer at Yezd, where it is no doubt intrinsi cally desirable that British commercial interests should be represented by some one not engaged in business or trade. A\ e will for the moment reserve our comments upon this suggestion. At Kerman, which is the capital of an important province, and the seat of a Governor-General, the appointment of a British Consul, which was first sanctioned under exceptional circumstances in the case of Captain Sykes in 1891, has at frequent intervals since, the latest being our despatch of August 10th, 1898, been the subject of discussion between Her Majesty’s Government and the Government* of India. The present position is this, that ior 5 years the Government of India have expressed their willingness to contribute one-half of the cost of the Kerman Consulate up to a limit of Bs 6,000 per annum. The views of the Foreign Office upon this proposal, which was communicated to it by Your Lordship on September 21st, 1898, have not yet been received by us. Sir M. Durand now proposes that this Consulate should be made permanent, and that possibly a native agent under its orders should be sent to Bampur. Before discussing*these pro posals, we think it advisable to analyse the larger issues raised by the questions of Seistan and the Persian Gulf. 26. Concerning Seistan, its importance and the present position there, we refer Your Lordship to a Minute which has been written by the Viceroy, who has made a special study of the question, and which is enclosed with this despatch. The facts enumerated by him are, we think, sufficient to show that Seistan is, by reason of its geographical position in relation both to North Khorasan, to Western Afghanistan, to British Baluchistan, and to the Persian Gulf, a position of no small strategical importance. Seistan is the present meeting point of the advanced pioneers of British and Russian influence. Perhaps on the whole, owing to recent activity on our pait, the British position and chances are the more hopeful. It is essential in the future, for reasons which have been argued in the Viceroy’s Minute, that Seistan should be retained in the British zone. It is fortunately not too late to secure that consummation. The steps which should be taken with that object will be examined when we formulate our final recommendations at the close of this despatch. 21. South of Seistan lies the still imperfectly known district of Persian Baluchistan. Every year this province is being* brought into closer contact with British associations, partly from the visits of British officers, partly from the wide-spreading influence exercised hy the Nushki-Seistan Trade* route, still more from the close connections, political and racial, prevailing between the inhabitants of the two sides of the Perso-Baluch border—a condition of affairs which is likely to be confirmed by the inevitable increase of British influeuce in the dominions of the Khan of Kalat.I [ 8 ] 22. Our inspection of the various sub-areas composing what we have described as the British sphere, has now brought us to the Persian Gulf—a subject which—no doubt from its more exclusively Indian aspect and bearing— has only been lightly touched upon by Sir M. Durand, but upon which it is necessary that we should address Your Lordship at greater length. 23. The de jure position in the Persian Gulf is that of a sea open to the flag of all nations, the northern shores and territorial waters of which are included in the dominions of Persia, wdiile its western and southern coasts are partially owned and partially claimed by Turkey, or arc in the occupation of Arab tiibcs, who have entered into treaty relationships of varying character, constituting a sort of veiled Protectorate, with Great Britain. The islands in the Gulf are owned either by Persia, or by Arab Chiefs (in the case of Bahrein under British protection ; but upon one of the Persian Islands, viz., Kishm, Great Britain pos sesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Maskat, to whom the island once belonged. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included in the same political system, are, on the northern shore of the Arabian Sea, the coasts of Persian Baluchistan, along which the overland wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company run as far as Jask, where a reserve of English territory exists under an agreement concluded in 1887 between the British and Persian Governments, and where a detachment of Indian troops, wdio had previously been stationed there between the years 1879 and 1887, was replaced in January 1898 in consequence of the murder of a British telegraph official and the disturbed state of Persian Baluchistan. A larger detachment was at the same time despatched to Charbar, near the eastern limits of the same province. On the southern and western coasts is the still independent kingdom or Sultanate of Oman (Maskat). 24. The de facto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraph might indicate. In the early years of the present century, the slave trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine uere engaged in a long and arduous struggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts. This conflict which was conducted entirely by British agency and means, without any help from the Persian Government, resulted in the establish ment of treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which they bound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Britamnica, which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrange ments and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar origin were the soundings of the channels and the surveys of the shores of the Persian Gulf, which the navigators of all nations owe to the labours of a long line of naval officers of the Indian service. Meanwhile, British trade has acquired almost a monopoly of the foreign commerce of the Gulf ports. Indian Bunias from Shikarpur and other parts of Sind have settled in considerable numbers at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire and Bahrein. They frequently farm the customs. The foreign imports and exports pass through their hands. These are for the most part conveyed to and from the Gulf in British ships, more than one Anglo-Indian Company (the ‘ British India ’, the ‘ Bombay and Persia’, and the ‘ Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf ’) having maintained for years a merchant steamer service between Karachi and Basrah, touching at the Gulf ports on the way, wdiilst the rival ventures that have occasionally been attempted by foreign nations have uniformly failed and have been withdrawn. 25. As the result of careful calculations of the trade returns of the three years, 1895-96-97, which are the latest at our disposal, w r e have ascertained that the total value of Imports and Exports in the Persian Gulf (including the Persian ports of Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Bushire, and Mohammerah; the Arab ports on the opposite coast; and Bahrein) in that triennial period amounted to £17,241,300 (at the rate of Rs. 15=£1). Of this total, Local trade accounted for £5,124,000, and External trade for £12,117,300; while of the latter total the trade with British possessions (including India) amounted to £9,709,500,or over 80 per cent of the entire External trade. In the same three years, out of a total of 2,161 steamers which entered and cleared from the Gulf ports, 2,039 were British, and their tonnage represented 84 per cent of the total tonnage. If the returns of Persian ports alone he required, the figures are Total trade, £11,172,000, of which Local trade = £2,169,400 and External trade = £9,002,600, the British proportion of the latter being £7,494,200, or 83 per cent. To these totals in cither case there should, in our opinion, certainly be added those of Basrah, which amounted in the same triennial period to £2,157,300. Unfortunately the manner in which these have been prepared, do not admit of our distinguishing the countries of origin or destination. The pro portion, however, that should properly he assigned to Anglo-Indian commerce may be inferred from the British percentage of shipping, that entered or cleared from that port in the three years referred to. It amounted to no less than 93 per cent both of the number and tonnage of the steamers engaged. 26. During the last thirty years the maintenance of the sub-marine cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Company from Eao to Task, and of the land lines from that place to Karachi, has also devolved upon the Indian Government, and has tended to increase an already preponderant influence over both the waters and the shores of this sea. Latterly there has been a deliberate but necessary con solidation of our influence in certain quarters where trouble threatened or where rivalry was feared. At the north-west extremity of the Gulf, we have, under instructions from Her Majesty’s Government, entered into engagements with the still independent Sheikh of Koweit, by which he has bound himself and his successors not to receive the representative of any other Power and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power—a proceeding which was dictated by the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority and by the incipient intrigues of other Powers. Similar machinations are known to be in progress at Bahrein, and will require to be counteracted by a more strict enforcement of the conditions to which the Sheikh is by treaty bound. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included within the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Maskat has for years been controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo- Indian hands; and its ruler has not merely for years been subsidised by the Government of India, but in 1891 entered into an Agreement with us, under the orders of Her Majesty’s Government, not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. 27. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication we have more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The island of Kharak wm's occupied by Indian forces from 1838 to 1842, and again in 1856-57. Bushire was held during the latter years, as also were Mohammerah and Ahwaz upon the Karun. The occupation of these places was an illustration of the vigour with which in past years our ascendency has been maintained. Their abandonment was a proof of the reluctance which has invariably been displayed to emphasise or to perpetuate these responsibilities. The latter, however, no less than the British position in Southern Persia in general, are now threatened by an external competition, to the evidences of which we next turn. 28. Sir M. Durand has in general terms described the commanding posi tion which the proximity of the Trans-Caspian Railway and of her Central Asian garrisons, the construction of the Ashkabad-Kuchan-Meshed cart-road, and the annual expenditure of large sums of money, have enabled Itussia to take up in the politics and commerce of the province of Khorasan. We proceed to develop the argument by showing how the Khorasan position has been and is being utilised as the base of a further and more southerly advance. 29. It was in 1889 that the campaign of what may he termed the Bussi- fication of Khorasan was opened with the appointment of a Bussian Consul- General at Meshed. In 1891 a native trader, named Haji Agha, appeared as[ 10 ] ■Russian News-agent at Birjaml; amt an emissary of bad cliaracter, named Muhammad Rahim Khan, who had already aZit^t^' W service, was asain taken into employ, and was posted as beus-agent at JSasira bad in Seistan. In the succeeding years Russian Armenians, trained ,.t Tiflis werebusilvat work surveying the country in a southerly direction, as far as the borders of Persia and Baluchistan. In 1&gt;95 a more direct blow at the large Anglo-Indian trade which at that time still made us way through Khorasan into the Russian possessions in Central Asia, was struck by the introduction of a Customs Tariff in Trans-Onspia, absolutely prohibiting the entry into the Russian territories of all British or Indian products excep indigo, tea and muslin, and these only under a heavy duty. In the same year M. Zaroudnv, a Russian politico-geologist, Anghce surveyor, paid Ins first visit to Kain and Seistan. Russian News-agents were also placed at 1 abbas and Neh, as well as at Birjand and Nasirabad. 30. In the meantime, in the latter part of 1896, the Government of India had decided upon taking active measures to open the long closed trading route from Quetta to Seistan. These intentions, and the prospective British interest in Seistan to which they testified, excited much concern in Russia; and in the following year the outbreak of plague in India off ered to the Russian authorities a welcome opportunity of, at the same time, endeavouring to strangle the new enterprise at its birth, and increasing their own influence in Seistan. Under the pretext of establishing a protective cordon to safeguard the 1 tmso-Atghan frontier in Persian interests from a disease which existed neither m Baluchistan nor in Afghanistan, Russian Cossacks under Russian officers were planted at a numbe? of places in Persian territory, where they turned back every caravan (ignoring an agreement that had been arrived at between Great Britain and rersia° for a 10 davs quarantine upon caravans arriving from infected countries), declined to accept any orders except those which came directly from the Russian Legation, and for a time absolutely closed the Herat-Meshed, road, in spite of orders to the contrary from the Persian Government—the object ot this measure being to divert Afghan trade from Meshed to Panjdeh. and Merv in Russian territorv. It was significant that upon crossing the Russian frontier the caravans, which had been refused passage through Persia under any condi tions, were only detained for three days in quarantine. The Persian Govern ment, after a feeble protest, acquiesced in these proceedings; and it may almost be said that Southern Khorasan passed for a time under Russian control. 31. It was with the object of anticipating a similar Russian intervention in Seistan that, in the spring of 3 897, the Government of India despatched Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh to superintend, any preventive measures that might be required in that district. Already Lieutenant Webb Ware, who had visited Seistan in March, in connection with the trade route, had reported : “ I was disagreeably astonished to find what ascendency Russia had gained through out Seistan Major Brazier-Creagh, a few months later, wrote : “ I was by no means surprised to find what ascendency the Russians had gained in the country. In the past four years Russian activity has been very manifest. It is not limited to Seistan, but extends all along the Perso-Afghan frontier up to Meshed, News-writers and agents being established at all the important trade centres, viz., Neh, Birjand, Tabbas, Khaf, and Turbat-i-Haidari 32. The recommendations made by the British officer were ignored by the Persian authorities; and he had not been long in Seistan when the expected Russian doctor (Miladchevsky by name), witu an escort of eight Cossacks, appeared upon the scene, a detachment of ten Cossacks under a Russian officer being also posted at Turbat-i-IIaidari, 80 miles south of Meshed, a point of junction of several caravan roads, so as effectually to stop any traffic to or from Seistan. An incidental result of Dr. Miladchevsky’s visit to Seistan was the dismissal, in consequence of a report from him, of the two native Russian agents to whom reference has been made, and their replacement by the Persian sub-contractors for customs for Kain and Seistan. These indivi duals proved to be equally faithless to the interests of their employers, and wererelieved of the representation of Russian interests in April of the present year. It was then announced that a Russian, named Ziedler, had been appointed Russian Consul in Seistan—an announcement which was imme diately followed by the despatch of Captain Sykes, hitherto British Consul at Kerman, to Seistan in a similar capacity. The Russian Consul would appear not yet to have taken up his post; and the Russian authorities are believed to he waiting to see the next move of Her Majesty’s Government before deciding upon their own action. 33. Meanwhile in 1898, M. Zaroudny re-appeared upon the scene of his former labours, and on the present occasion pushed his politico-scientific studies as far south ^is Persian Baluchistan and Bam pur. Early in the present year the Agent to the Governor-General at Meshed reported that two Russian officers, 1 doctor and 10 Cossacks were still at Turbat-i-Uaidari, and 1 Russian Officer, 2 Medical Assistants and 10 Cossacks at Karez. There are also 58 Persian sowars scattered about at different places between Meshed and Seistan. who are paid through the Russian officers and take their orders from them. The recrudescence of plague in India has in fact provided an excuse for the continuance, just as its original appearance was pleaded in support of the in troduction, of a quasi- Russian Protectorate in Southern Khorasan. A more active assertion of the same pretensions has since been witnessed in the mission of M. Stroeff, Dragoman to the Russian Consulate at Meshed, with presents valued at £1,4400, to the Persian Governor of Kain, who is brother to the Governor of Seistan and is believed to covet the succession to that post. The sanitary plea was also advanced in the course of ihe past summer to explain the despatch of Russian doctors to Kerman and even to Shiraz. An interesting commentary upon these proceedings may be found in an observation in Lieutenant Webb Ware’s report upon the Quetta-Seistan trade route for 1897-98, where he says that “ the chief hindrance to the further development of this route is to be found in the obstructive measures taken by the Russian officers striving to further tho interests of that country at the expense of India”. 34. The facts which we have enumerated will, we think, be sufficient to convince Your Lordship of two propositions: firstly, that Russia regards with unconcealed aversion the opening of the British commercial route from India to Seistan and Khorasan, and will spare no efforts to rob it of success; secondly, that she regards with an interested eye the future of Seistan itself, and is already preparing, by a display of armed force and by the assumption of executive authority, to pave the way for an eventual inclusion within the Russian sphere of that portion of the Shah’s dominions. 35. In the same context, and as illustrating the political and strategical object which such an advance may be believed to have in view, it will not be forgotten that during the past few years, the Russian Government have constructed a railway from Merv to Kushk upon the Afghan frontier within 80 miles of Herat, and have stacked at the terminus the railway plant for a future extension to Herat itself. Should any doubt be entertained as to the purpose for which this extension (which is destitute of any commereial justifi cation) was planned, it may be solved by a reference to the frank admission made to Sir N. O’Conor by M. deWitte, Russian Minister of Finance, in June 1898, that it was designed “ to enable Russia to attack Afghanistan in case of complications with England ”. When it is remembered that such an attack can onlv be made in direct violation of solemn international engagements, it is not, we 'think, incumbent upon us to argue at further length that the political ambitions of Russia in Eastern Persia, and in close proximity to the Afghan border, have an ulterior significance which it would be folly to ignore. 36. Kor can we divorce these proceedings from the idea that, :n seeking to obtain a preferential footing in Seistan, Russia is not merely endeavouring to block a promising avenue of Anglo-Indian trade, and to acquire a position of potential menace to British interests on the western flank of Afghanistan, but that she is also concerned in the prosecution of an advance, which is not expected to terminate until it has brought her to the Persian Gulf. It is known[ 12 ] that at least on one occasion negotiations for the cession to Russia of a Persian port at the eastern extremity of the Gulf have taken place between the Russian and the Persian Governments; and, if such negotiations have hit! at either proved abortive, or have been nominally repudiated by one or other ot the parties concerned, it is yet, we think, in our power to show that they are not only not inconsistent with, but are definitely corroborated by, the evidence of Russian activity in Central and Southern Persia to which we now turn. 37. In 1897, a Russian Consul was appointed for the first time to Ispahan, where Russian imports had not hitherto greatly exceeded a total of 300 bales per annum. He was given a salary and title in excess of ^ those enjoyed by Pie British representative. During the present year this official, Prince Dabiya, has been heard of at Shiraz and Bushire as the guest of the French Vice- Consul, and subsequently at Mohammerah and Shushter on the Karun, where he freely denounced British methods and ambitions. Sir M. Durand has recently informed us by telegraph that the corps of so-called Persian Cossacks at Tehran {i.e., Persian soldiers trained and commanded by Russian officers) has been raised from 1,000 to 1,500 men, and that detachments of this corps have for the first time been taken with them to the south by the Governors of Shiraz and Arabistam For the present the Russian officers have stayed behind ; but it is not difficult to imagine the circumstances in which they might claim to rejoin their regiments. In 1897 , M. Krugelow was sent from Jerusalem as Russian Consul to Baghdad, with the special object of reporting upon the acquisition by Russia of a coaling station in the Persian Gulf. This gentleman has taken much interest in Koweit, where Russian emissaries from Baghdad have been residing continuously during the present year. In this context it will not be forgotten that the concession recently sought for with the aid. of the Russian Embassy at Constantinople by Count Jvapnist, a Russian of high rank, for a railway from Tripoli in Syria to the Persian Gulf contemplated a terminus at Koweit. 38. In Bushire and Bunder Abbas the Russians have lately developed a marked interest. Two Russian doctors (Drs. Marc and Oust) arrived at Bushire in 1897 for the now familiar purpose of studying the plague, which, however, did not make its appearance until two years later, in 1899. Dr. Marc in 1897 occupied his waiting hours in visiting Bunder Abbas, from whence he was in the habit of despatching official reports to his Government,, and where he magnanimously treated all patients free of charge. His medical pursuits at this^place were assisted by a third Russian, named Adamoff, vyho appears to have been an artillery officer, and who subsequently visited Bushire and Basrah. In 1898 two other Russian doctors, named Rodzewitz and Kornajevski, appeared upon the scene, and visited Basrah, Bushire and Bunder Abbas. In December 1898 a fifth Russian doctor, named Paschkowski, arrived in the Gulf, and did not fail to pay the regulation visit to Bunder Abbas; while he displayed a considerable professional activity during the recent outbreak of plague at Bushire, where he has announced that, upon his approaching return to Russia, he is to be replaced by two compatriots. In connection with this medical propaganda, it will be in Your Lordship’s recollection that when the first rumours were circulated of plague at Bushire in the past summer, the Russian Legation at Tehran at once announced their intention of sending doctors, with Cossack escorts, to Bushire as well as Shiraz, in order to establish a plague cordon for the protection of those places from the Indian pestilence, and that Russian doctors took up their quarters both at Shiraz and Kerman. These precautions mi&lt;rht he thought to indicate a praiseworthy desire to close every conceivable channel of entry into Asiatic Russia against the plague, were they not, as has already been shown, in striking contrast with the laxity of system, that is at the same time observed both on the Perso-Russian and on the Russo-Afghan frontiers, across which alone can plague succeed in entering the Russian dominions. In continuation of our story it may he mentioned that in 1895 a Russian officer visited and surveyed the island of Hormuz opposite to Bunder Abbas, and that other and non-medical Russian emissariesici) [ 13 ] have also recently been beard of at the latter place (the two latest, M. Babit- chioff and Baron de Schedenore, as lately as August in the present year). It should not, moreover, be forgotten that it was Russian opposition that in 1898 broke down the loan to the Persian Government from the Imperial Bank of Persia, the security of which was to be the customs of the southern ports, to be collected by agents of the Bank. 39. AVe are aware that on April 18th of the present year, with reference to reports that have been published of Russian designs upon the island of Kishm, adjoining Hormuz, Count Mouravieff assured Sir C. Scott, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!!, that “there was absolutely no intention on the part of the Russian Government to add to the burden of their existing respon sibilities by acquiring outlying ports or stations which would require naval defence in time of war”; and we do not doubt that this emphatic assurance represents the views sincerely entertained by the Emperor of Russia. But our faith in the value of this assurance has been somewhat shaken by the later information received from a Persian official of high rank and station, known personally to the Viceroy, to the effect that he believes Russia to have acquired certain rights in regard to a port in the Persian Gulf, which however it may not suit her at once to enforce. Moreover there is in practice a limit to the duration of all such pledges, which, even if given by the sovereign, are not always regarded as binding by his officials; and previous experience is not altogether encouraging to the belief in a prolonged existence of the present undertaking, should circumstances compel an opposite course. There are more over other means, well-known to Her Majesty’s Government from recent experience in other parts of the world, of obtaining political and territorial influence, independently of the actual acquisition of harbours or stations. 40. It is, in our opinion, more than a coincidence that simultaneously with the increasing Russian interest in Central and Southern Persia which we have described, there should also have been a notable revival of French activity in those quarters. In 1896 the Messageries Maritimes Company commenced a subsidised service from Bombay to the ports of the 1 ersian Gulf, although, owing to vessels of unsuitable draught having been employed, the enterprise was not a success and was shortly abandoned. In 1897 a French Vice-Consul (M Ferrand) was for the first time appointed at Bushire, although the value of French trade with the Persian Gulf in that year amounted only to the modest total of £82,618 (of which £73,899 was sugar). He was succeeded in 1898 by M. Bryois. who recently informed the agent of one of the British Trading Companies at Bushire that the French Government intended shortly to establish a subsidised line of steamers to Mohammerah and tbe Karun. It was perhaps in connection with this project that in March 1899, M. Bryois paid a visit to the Karun, where a French scientific party, under M. de Morgan, has for some time been engaged in politico-archaeological researches in Arabistan. M hen the French Charge d’Affaires, Comte d’Arlot, recently visited Ispahan^ the Zil-es-Sultan vouch safed the corroborative information to the British Legation that the object of these movements on the part of the French was to obtain a footing at Mohammerah Shushter and Dizful. During our recent negotiations with the bheikh ot Roweit about the future of that harbour, it was with some surprise that we learned from him that the French had already approached him on the subject. In Bahrein a so-called French merchant, M. Goguyer, who until recently was engaged m Maskat in an attempt to revive the traffic in arms under the French flag has been reported as endeavouring to induce the inhabitants to purchase Irene i pio ec- Hon bv the pavment of small sums. In 1899 a French Consular Agency was established at Lingah, where the same ingenious system of manufacturing French subjects (for the most successful illustration of which we must look to Siam) was started, and where the French flag was hoisted by the Diagoma the French Vice-Consul at Bushire. Finally, Her Majesty’s Government are letter aware than ourselves of the recent negotiations for a French h«n to the Persian Government upon the security of the customs of the Gulf ports, and a promise of a railway monopoly in that country. 1\&gt;Z[ ] 41. French interests in the Persian Gulf, either political or commercial, are so small; her own territories are so distant; and the Gulf lies so far out of the track of her merchant vessels or mcn-of-war, that we are unable to construe these proceedings in any other light than as an attempt to cause trouble and annoyance to a possible rival, and to lend an independent assistance to the plans of a European ally. Substantial confirmation of these views will, in our opinion, be derived from a study of recent French action at Maskat, where, although French trade is infinitesimal, and a French man-of- war has been in the habit of paying a passing visit on an average only once in the year, the French Government have nevertheless during the past six months been endeavouring to obtain, under the guise of coaling facilities, a position w r hich would provide them with an independent pled a terre in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. This policy has been foreshadowed by the free grant of the French flag to Arab dhows, owning allegiance to the Sultan of Maskat, and is facilitated by the influence over the latter petty potentate that has been acquired by the French Vice-Consul, whose anti-British inclina tions and intrigues are so well known to Her Majesty’s Government as to require no recapitulation here. Confirmation of our suspicions regarding a Franco-Russian entente in Persia and in the Persian Gulf is further afforded by a telegram, dated June 7th, 1899, from Sir M. Durand to Colonel Meade, which has already been communicated both to Your Lordship and to the Foreign Office, and in which Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran remarks : “ You may be quite certain that Russia and France are working in unison ”. 42. It should be noted that in the recent papers, with copies of which w e have been favoured by Her Majesty’s Government, we have found a repudiation of French ambitions in the quarter under discussion, no less explicit, than that wdiich w r e have already quoted from the lips of Count Mouravieff. On July 19th, 1899, M. Cambon said to Lord Salisbury that “ France had no political aspiration whatever in the Persian Gulf; that she did not desire any kind of fortification or settlement or political privileges, or anything beyond the maintenance of those rights already insured to her by treaty We have been gratified to read this assurance, by which we hope that' succeeding French ministries may hold themselves bound. But w r e regret that it has not been communicated, not merely to Her Majesty’s Government, but also to the French Agents in those regions, who do not appear to be equally acquainted with the view T s of the Government that they serve. 43. In recent years Germany has begun to display a positive and an increasing interest in Persia and also in the Persian Gulf. This interest has been the historical, and perhaps the natural, sequel of a commercial policy that has for some time aimed at securing the control of the principal railways in the Turkish dominions in Asia Minor, and of a political ambition, that more recently still, w r ould appear to aim at the protection of the Ottoman Empire, alike in Europe and Asia. The obvious corollary to a system of German railways in Asia Minor, would be similar railroads to the Persian border and through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf. Already, as Sir M. Durand has in formed the Foreign Office, the Germans have procured a concession for the construction of a road from Khanikin, on the Turko-Persian frontier, to Tehran, and have apparently only abstained from pressing for a railroad in the same quarter, because of the violent opposition with which the Russian Minister met the proposal at Tehran. The second son of the Shah, Prince Malik Mansur, has been spending several months in 1898-99 in Germany, wdiere his education and proclivities are reported as having acquired a marked philo-Teutonic tin^e. German military instructors have been proffered for the reorganisation of the Persian army. Prolongations of the Turko-German railways to Baghdad and to the Persian Gulf have been and are still being freely discussed; and the German Government are endeavouring to procure an interest in the overland Turkish i • ^ a °/ ^ ie itself a German Consulate w^as established in 1SJ7 at Buslnre, to safeguard the interests of six German subjects in the entire ports of that sea. A Bremen firm opened business at Bushire, but the specially chartered steamers which were sent out from Germany appear to have been a[ 15 ] a mo ^ e res oluto attempt is being made to capture the a &lt; vet. Quite recently a number of Germans have for some time been engaged in a study of the situation at Bunder Abbas. During the sprint of the present year, a German man-of-war, the “ Arcona ,, 5 visited Maskat, Lingah, re P° rt ; s . have leached us of the likely appearance, at no distant date, of a German line of merchant steamers in the Gulf. p .11* ^ While we regard these symptoms of increasing German interest in the eisum ljult as emphasising the international aspect which the Persian question appears more and more destined to assume, and therefore as adding to the complexities of an already sufficiently difficult situation, we do not question me bom pie commercial enterprise which is carrying German trade there, as to so many other open seas and ports in the world, and we can conceive that we evei } ^ n&lt; b ia the existence of German political interests, an occasional ally or sa eguard tor our own. German interests, however, have a tendency to grow wi, i some rapidity, and hy steps which are not always acceptable to their neighbours: and we think that the need for an early decision upon the future po icy to be adopted by Her Majesty’s Government is not diminished, but is enhanced, by the appearance of so active a competitor upon the scene. 45. Apart from the recurrent svmptoms of activity on the southern and western shores of the Persian Gulf, with which Her Majesty’s Government are annliar, the Turkish Government have also in recent years displayed an increas- ing interest in its political fortunes. A determined attempt has been made to ortily the shadowy pretensions of the Ottoman Porte to suzerainty over Koweit. A lurkish title has been conferred upon the Sheikh; and forces have more than once been assembled at Basrah for a contemplated expedition against that place. Intrigues are constantly in progress at Bahrein. During 1898 and 1899 a lurkish corvette has been a frequent visitor at Lingah, where, the Sheikh being of Arab descent, Turkish interests are supposed to exist. Finally, the decisions of the Venice Conference and the proceedings of the Sanitary Board at Constantinople have enabled Turkey to claim an interest in the navigation of those waters, of which she has not been slow to take advantage. 4G. The only other recent evidences of foreign intervention in the Persian Gulf, of which we are cognisant, are a concession for the pearl-fisheries in that sea, which was given in 1898 by the Persian Government to a Spaniard and a Belgian, under Russian auspices; and the contemplated appearance at the Gulf ports of customs officers of Belgian nationality, similar to those who have already been placed in charge of the customs houses at Kermanshah and Tabriz, and whose influence, said to be omnipotent at the present moment with the Sadr Azam, is known to be entirely enlisted on the side of France and Russia. CjK *V ..O •' ■ &gt; * *. j '4.C. 47.. We have gathered together these symptoms of external, and notably of Russian or of Russophil, interest in Southern Persia and in the Persian Gulf, not because we desire to invest them individually with an importance to which they are not entitled, but because collectively they indicate, in a manner that is not open to misinterpretation, the policy and ambitions of foreign Powers, and because we desire to impress upon Her Majesty’s Government the fact that in an area, by land and by sea, which Great Britain regards with good reason as falling within her sphere of influence, that influence is being directly and increasingly challenged by other nations, who, in proportion as their foothold becomes more securely established, will resist any preferential claims, upon what ever foundation in history or in fact they may rest, and will claim for themselves an equality of right which in theory it may be difficult to contest. 48. More particularly do these considerations apply to the case of Russia, whose advance across the deserts that form a natural barrier of division between Northern and Southern Persia, cannot be regarded with anything but uneasiness by the Government of India, and the appearance of whose flag in the Persian Gulf would import a novel element of unrest into a situation that is at no time without its anxious features. We desire deliberately to say to[ 16 ] tha^ 1 difficult'as find^in”'1 finan^nd LTJwecon“fnot contem^te' without dismay the prospect of Russian neighbourhood in Eastern or Southern Persia, the inevitable consequenceof whfch must he a great increase of our own burdens; while the maritime defensibility of India would require to he altogether reconsidered, ueie tie dangers o/a land invasion to he supplemented by the appearance ot a possi de antagonist as a naval power in waters contiguous to Indian shores. 49 We cannot pretend to divine the future, or to say whether any European Power, and if so which, will at any time push her advance to the point of claiming a maritime outlet in or near to the Persian Gulf. I e t of Mesopotamia lies beyond our ken: and it may be that m the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, some stronger Power may one day exercise dominion at Baghdad, may occupy Basrah, and may demand access for its vessels to the neighbouring waters of the Gulf. Such a consummation, it is in our opinion, in the interests of British policy, as long as may be possible, to postpone. But upon the question of allowing any European Power, and more especially Bussia, to overrun Central and Southern Persia, and so to reach the Gulf or to acquire naval facilities in the latter even without such territorial connections, we do not conceive that any doubt whatever can be entertained; and we imagine that it will be accepted as a cardinal axiom of British policy that no such development wmdd be acquiesced in by Her Majesty s Government. We would arrive with the greater confidence at this conclusion, since we were lately informed by Your Lordship that on April loth of the present year, Lord Salisbury communicated to the Persian Government with reference to rumours of the cession of a port in the Gulf to Bussia, that “ Her Majesty’s Government felt it to be their duty to renew the intimation that it would not be compatible with the interests of the British Empire that any European Power should exercise control or jurisdiction over the ports of the Persian Gulf”. 50. Such being the existing situation in Southern Persia, and the prin ciples of policy accepted by Her Majesty’s Government being as already stated, •we pass to a consideration of the manner in which these principles should be translated into action, and of the steps which should, in our opinion, be taken at the present juncture for the protection of the common interests of Great Britain and the Indian Empire. 51. We are aware that, more than half a century ago, there were exchanged, and have more than once since been repeated, certain explicit assurances concerning the integrity and independence of Persia between the Governments of Great Britain and Bussia. The first of these assurances were entered into by Lord Palmerston and Count Nesselrode. The former in a despatch, dated September 5th, 1834, placed on record that “ the Governments of Great Britain and Bussia are acting, with regard to the affairs of Persia in the same spirit, and are equally animated by a sincere desire to maintain, not only the internal tranquillity, but also the independence and integrity of Persia ”. Count Nesselrode, in despatches, dated October 20th, 1838, and January 29th, 1839, reiterated these pledges on behalf of his Government. Again in 1873 the continued existence of these mutual assurances was referred to with satisfaction by Count de Brunnow, as reported in a despatch by Lord Granville, dated July 10th, 1873. Einally, on March 12th, 1888, M. de Giers intimated, through M. de Staal, to Lord Salisbury that the Bussian Government “ have no objection to placing again on record that their views on this point are in no way altered”; and a communication to the effect that the engagements between Great Britain and Bussia to respect and promote the integrity and independence of the Persian kingdom had again been renewed and confirmed, was accordingly made by Sir H. D. Wolff to the Shah. 52. Whilst it may be presumed that these pledges, so frequently renewed, are still in existence, and while we have no desire to infer that they are17 ] within measurable distance of being broken, we are yet of opinion that t hey are in themselves quite insufficient to arrest the centripetal prooress of • ^ sia J l 111 ,1 . &lt; ' n&lt; ' e m Persia, or to save either the Persian kingdom, or°British interests in it, from the erosive agencies that we have described. Within the limits of a nominally still existing integrity and independence so manv cen«Me'T ntS Up t T both th ° se att, ' ibutes are possible, that by almost imper ceptible dogre.s they pass into the realm of constitutional fiction, where they may continue to provide an exercise for the speculations of the iurist W after they have been contemptuously ignored by statesmen. ° i , Oo ', If s proposition be accepted, and if we cannot rely upon written fciVe 8 tiers' 1 H h V , ; tU, ' e 0 u Pe - a ’ 11 beh0 - s 1° examine The valus r P ohcies that ha ^ e been or can be proposed.

It was dne to expire in the present 1 tl P information from Sir M. Durand is that it has, under pressure fiom the Russian Government, been renewed for another term of five years. , , T he aR ernative policy recommended by Sir M. Durand is that we plainly intimate that any Russian encroachments in Northern Persia will provoke corresponding measures for the protection of British interests in I he south. In his Memorandum of September 1895, Her Majesty’s Minister suggested that this declaration should be made to the Russian Government. In his despatch of February 1899 he proposed that it should also be made to the Persian Government; so that both parties should be well aware of the steps that would follow upon any further Russian aggression. It has been objected to this policy that such an engagement might impose upon the British Govern ment an unwelcome obligation to intervene and to add to British responsibi lities in Southern Persia, at the moment most opportune to Russia, and least opportune to ourselves. There is force in this objection; although we think . f. R m, gbt be met by introducing sufficient elasticity into the proposed leave . Her W a j es ty’ s Government free to act for the protection o Biitish interests in Southern Persia, not in a specified manner at a specified moment,^ but m what manner and at what juncture might commend itself o ien judgment. Moreover the value of the objection is somewhat weakened &gt;y the consideration that did Russia take any such step in Northern Persia as is here contemplated, counter-action of some sort, with or without a previous intimation, would in all probability be imposed upon Her Majesty’s Government; while the knowledge that a Russian advance in the north might he the signal[ 18 ] U IjriClLC C4C3 U.

We have already alluded to the line across Persia drawn by Sir M. Durand from Khanikin on the Turkish frontier, through Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman to Seistan, as indicating the northern limits oi the sphere within which British political influence and trade are paramount. To some extent this partition is assisted by geographical conditions, the great deserts of Central Persia constituting a natural barrier between the north and the south, and roughly dividing tbe one from the other. But this situation is modified both in the west of Persia, where there are no deserts, and where there is no physical line of demarcation between the respective spheres of influence; in the centre of Persia, where Ispahan can hardly he said to constitute the natural frontier of any geographical zone; and also in the extreme east where Seistan, the inclusion of which in the British sphere would he an obligatory point, lies not to the south but to the north of the great desert. These con siderations might not affect the success of any engagement that was carried out with equal bona fides by both parties: but they might become a fruitful source of friction were such a good understanding not to he counted upon in the future. In any case, we would recommend that the line of partition, suggested by Sir M. Durand, should he so far amended as to substitute Kashan for Ispahan. It would he undesirable that any Russian railway should penetrate further south than Kashan, which indeed is separated by a considerable range of hills from Ispahan, or that Russia should have right of access to the very fringe of the latter district. 57. We have observed that in China the Agreement recently concluded between Her Majesty’s Government and Russia as to spheres of interest has related to railways only. Either party has pledged itself not to seek on its own account or on behalf of others for railway concessions in the rival sphere, and not to obstruct, directly or indirectly, applications for such concessions, supported by the other in that sphere. Prima facie there does not appear to he any reason why such an agreement should not equally he extended to mines, roads, and other industrial or economic undertakings. The value of such an understanding is considerable; because although political influence is not expressly mentioned, yet in eastern countries commercial and industrial enterprises are the familiar agencies through which political influence is exercised by alien powers, and because that influence is apt to follow in the wake of railways and trade. We do not think, if such an agreement were arrived at with Russia, with reference to the Persian territories lying north and south of the predicated line, that there would be an end to Russian designs in Southern Persia or in the Persian Gulf. Such a result might, perhaps, ensue from an engagement that no political influence should he exercised by either partyon the opposite side of the line. But there would be manifest difficulties in arriving at any such understanding; since it would be out of the question to remove the British representatives, either at Tehran, at Tabriz, or at Meshed, whose functions necessarily involve the exercise of some sort of political influence, while a corresponding objection would no doubt be felt by the Russian Government. But even an engagement limited to railway and commercial exploitation would have this effect, that it would deprive Russia of the means by which political or territorial ambitions in the rival sphere could most easily be carried out, and would render it difficult for her to push them to success, as long as Great Britain remained on the alert. 58. There are, however, difficulties and drawbacks in the case of such an understanding which it would be impolitic to ignore. We have already hinted at one of their number. The facts with reference to Seistan which have been mentioned by the Viceroy in his Minute, by Sir M. Durand, and also in this despatch, indicate the absolute necessity of including that district within the British sphere. Nevertheless Seistan is physically and administratively a part of the province of Khorasan, from which it is severed by no clear line of division, the Governorship of Seistan being vested in a member of the old ruling family of Kain, the two existing heads of which are brothers, residing respectively at Tabbas and Birjand. It also seems exceedingly doubtful to us whether Russia would, by any such agreement as we are discussing, forego her designs upon Seistan itself, and still more her chances of reaching the eastern extremity of the Persian Gulf. Nor again is it clear that she would be willing to cancel the engagement with regard to railway construction, which she has recently renewed with the Persian Government, and to band over the southern half of Persia to possible railway exploitation by British agency, in return for a monopoly of similar exploitation (which may be said to be already at her disposal) in the northern half. These, however, are considerations which could onlv be decided by the attitude of Russia herself, w T ere she approached on the' subject by Her Majesty’s Government. We indicate them merely for the purpose of showing that we are far from confident that the suggestion, if put forward, will meet with a favourable reception. 59. A more serious drawback, from the point of view of British interests, is the fact that the capital of Persia would lie in the northern or Russian sphere, and that Russian influence there, already predominant, could hardly fail to become supreme. The situation that has recently arisen in China would present itself with ten-fold gravity and emphasis. A desire w r ould not merely be inti mated to connect the capital with the Russian railway system : but a line itself would, we may imagine, at once be made to Tehran, while corresponding lines would in all probability be constructed from the Russian frontier in Georgia to Tabriz, and in ’Trans-Caspia to Meshed. With the three great cities of Northern Persia thus permanently linked with the Russian system, the power of pressure exercised by the Russian Government, which is already considerable, would be positively overwhelming. The results would, in all probability, be felt beyond the limits of Persia. They would aggravate the already formidable offensive strength of Russia against Northern Afghanistan, and would increase the weight and influence of her position throughout Central Asia. In Persia itself, the Shah would tend more and more to become a Kussian puppet, and Northern Persia a Russian proconsulate. We should look with great anxiety, in such a case, upon the fate of such institutions as the Imperial Bank of Peisia, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, whose head-quarters are in Tehran. We should fear a marked diminution of influence on the part of Her Maiesty’s representative at the capital; and we do not conceal our anticipations that in the long run such a partition might involve the permanent break up of the Persian kingdom, and, if it did not ultimately lead to rival Russian and British Protectorates in the north and south, might at any rate result in the selection of another capital, and in the rule of more than one native prince in Persia. . 60. Neither will it be overlooked by Her Majesty’s Government that, while any such arrangement with Russia might preclude that Power from obtaining^control over Central and Southern Persm and m that reachn, the Persian Gulf, it would not for one moment retard, but mi 0 to e[ 20 ] contrary accelerate her advance refa°d wHh^carcely inferior wav of Baghdad.

P 62 We have now placed before Your Lordship the pros ami corn, as they b T-n in our pves of the alternative policies in Persia. W hile present themselves t • t ’ o{ succesS; W e are ourselves of opinion that the experiment of an i nderstanding with Russia as to future spheres of interest n that coimt^ is worthy of being made, in the interests both of Persia itself, more of harmony between the two great Powers, upon whose relations the peace of Asia may be said to depend. Should Her Majesty’s Government decide upon makinglnv overtures to the Russian Government m the direction indicated! and should they either he rejected, or result in ^t he nossible to adopt the alternative recommended by Sir M. Dm and. In ted, if the terms of a reasonable arrangement are proffered by one party, and are refused by the other, the natural corollary would appear to be that the originator of the proposal should reserve to himself the right to protect by whatever means may be at his disposal the interests which he has endeavoured to conserve by friendly co-operation; and should meet what would m such a case be conscious aggression on the one side by retaliation on the other. 63. In any case, however, though still more in the case of a failure to arrive at an understanding with Russia, we conceive that it is incumbent upon Her Maiesty’s Government and upon the Government of Infba to come to an early decision upon the subsidiary question, raised by Sir M. Durand, namely, as to the steps that require forthwith to be taken in order to safeguard British and Indian interests in the so-called British sphere in Persia from the competi tion with which we have shown them to lie threatened. 64. Sir M. Durand, in his despatch, has made a calculation of the sums annually expended by Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India respectively upon the British establishments at present maintained in Persia. He arrives at a grand total of £38,470 per annum distributed in the following proportions: Her Majesty’s Government,* £14,376; Government of India, £24,094. Inasmuch as these figures are not, in all respects, correct, and as they omit several items of charge for which Indian revenues are respon sible, we have made an independent computation, which is here presented, for purposes of comparison in tabular form. In a further column we present the charges also borne by the Government of India and Her Majesty’s Government * That is £12,876 + £1,500 on account of travelling allowances.[ 21 ] severally in respect of Mesopotamia and theTioris ■&gt; » • n a i • which though not belonging to the Persian Hnl; • ’ T !“ klsl1 Arabia, an area, t^VeSn G P uU:- Pay ’ 38 iDSeparably «e“h t°he trat an7po“ !• Sir M.

According to these figures, which we have been at much pains to verify, it appears that upon the various establishments maintained by the British Government in Persia, the Imperial Government spends £15,466 and the Gov ernment of India £61,052 per annum. If Turkish Arabia be included in the calculation, as we think it must in fairness be, and as it was in a statement prepared for and presented to the Boyal Commission on Indian expenditure in 1896, the totals will amount to Great Britain £15,597, India £71,656. 66. It will not, we apprehend, he denied that these contributions do not at all fairly represent the respective proportions of Imperial and of Indian interest in Persia and its surroundings. The argument into which we entered m an earlier pait of this despatch will have failed in its purpose if it has not given good grounds for thinking that in the determination of British interests in Persia too much stress has hitherto been laid upon the Indian, and too little upon the British, quota and that a more even partition both of responsibility u den mi 0 ht with reason be adopted in the future. 67. This however is a question which we are not at the present moment called upon to discuss with any minuteness, the more so as it is understood to be one of the subjects that have attracted the attention of the Boyal Commission above alluded to, and that are likely to be dealt with in its Beport. We observe that in the evidence so far printed and published, some attention has been paid to the case, and we reserve till the appearance of the final Beport, any further remarks that we may have to offer thereon. 68. We would observe, however, in strict connection with the question nov under examination, viz., the increase of Consular and other establishments ii Persia—winch is itself a branch of the wider subject-that in the reconsider- ation of the case for which the Government of India have more than onc&lt; pleaded, it appears to us that one of two principles may with advantage b( borne m view. The entire charges which are placed upon the revenues Sf the British Empire for Persia and Turkish Arabia may he added together, and mai be divided m certain proportions, to be revised, if necessary, at definite intervals between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. Some such principle Z adopted, when m 1859 the British Mission at Tehran was re-transferred to tin loreign Office, and when it was l iid down by Lord John Russell that thr ratio of the charges met. by India and Great Britain should be as 12 to 5 Wc me not anaie that this principle has ever since been formally repudiated pra” S aPPCarS t0 llaV ° beCD Wide] y departed from in , . m et!io&lt;[ would he that of determining what are the snhci or localities m 1 crsia of spma concern either to Her Majesty’s Govemme or to the Government of India, and of debiting the charges incurred fo thr against the revenues respectively of the United Kingdom and of India T is the s du ion winch we should on the whole prefer, even though in pract it might he found to be less economical of Indian expenditure H,.,ftnti arrangement Responsibility would be more sharply defined, and more qu Kk acted upon, the chances of disagreement or dispute would be greatly diminish^and either party would have its contribution more directly under its own control It would no be difficult m our opmion to constitute sucli a partition of interest which would be determined by a combination of geographical, political and commercial conditions. The parts of Persia that border upon Afghanistan Baluchistan and the eastern end of the Persian Gulf would naturally foil within the Indian sphere. The northern and western portions contiguous to the Caucasian pioymees of Russia, to Turkey, and to Mesopotamia, would possess a greater interest for Her Majesty’s Government. To a considerable, though still only a partial, extent this principle has already been acted upon ; whilst it will be m the recollection of \ our Lordship that the Government of India have m one case pressed for a vindication of it, which they have felt to be equallv demanded by policy and justice. In February and'again in August 1895 our predecessors expressed a very strong opinion that they should 0 not be called upon to contribute towards the Karun service, as long as the subsidy for the mail service on the Tigris was met exclusively from Indian revenues. They stated their opinion that “ the interests involved in the Karun service are purely Imperial and not Indian, and, if this service ceases altogether, the interests of India will not be affected thereby It was only after the receipt of an urgent appeal from the Foreign Office, and on the explicit understanding that the whole question of the distribution of the charges on account of the Tigris and the Karun should he referred to the Royal Commission then sitting, that the Government of Lord Elgin, not without a vigorous dissent from the then Finance Member, Sir J. Westland, consented to continue the payment of a moiety of the Karun subsidy pending the stipulated decision. We cordially endorse the views which were expressed by our predecessors in respect of the Imperial and non-Indian character of this charge, and we shall he glad to learn what are the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the subject. 70.. The mention of the Karun and Tigris services affords an incidental illustration of the commercial considerations by which the allocation of respon sibility that we are discussing might be determined. It is, of course, difficult to decide in the ease of any particular market or harbour the exact shares of interest in it that may be claimed by British or by Indian trade. The former is more likely to be in the ascendant in the north, the latter in the south, of Persia. Broadly speaking, however, we do not think it will be disputed that the supervision and promotion of British commerce in foreign countries are a responsibility properly devolving upon the Imperial Government. The fact that a considerable proportion of the trade of any foreign town or port passes to or from India (and even of such trade a large part is apt to he often British in origin) is not a reason for placing the consular or other charges exclusively upon the Indian revenues, any more than a corresponding preponderance of Colonial trade in any particular quarter would he regarded as a reason for demanding a contribution from the Colonies. We imagine the real line of distinction to be that, whereas the commercial interests of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects, outside of India, are in the main the concern of the Imperial Government, yet in cases where the political importance of a place or district exceeds the commercial, and where that political importance is Indian rather than English in character, the Government of India may legitimately he called upon to defray sometimes a large proportion, some times the whole of the cost. In this way we may account for the exclusive financial responsibility of India for Meshed, for Bushire and the other ports of the Gulf, and for Baghdad (although we regard the latter as an extreme and questionable extension of tlie principle). On the other hand the charges for Ispahan, Kermanshah, Tabriz, &amp;c., fall, or ought in our judgment to fall, upon the Imperial revenues. Tehran, as the capital, is, in a sense, a meeting ground of the two systems ; and a division of the cost between the two Govern ments has accordingly been in existence ever since 1835, althougb the passage of time has witnessed a gradual reduction of the Indian contribution, and may, we hope, lead to a further reconsideration of the matter, when the present arrangement expires in 1901.[ 21 ] 71. We will now proceed to apply the principles which have been enunciated to a consideration of the particular question referred to us by Your Lordship, viz., the suggestions of Sir M. Durand on the one hand, and our own views or proposals on the other, concerning the increase of Consular and other establishments in Persia. We may say at once that we are anxious to regard the question from a broad-minded and liberal point of view, that we have no desire to haggle with Her Majesty’s Government over shares of responsibility or of cost, and that we are quite willing to add to our own charges for the protection of .British interests in Persia, in the confident belief that Her Majesty’s Govern ment will not be behindhand with a similar generosity. Our argument as to the magnitude and significance of those interests and the reality of the dangers with which they are assailed would have been insincere, were we unprepared to give to it a practical demonstration. 72. Por the sake of clearness we will divide the country into different spheres, representing with sufficient accuracy the rough lines of demarcation between British and Indian interest. In the northern and central sphere, and m the western sphere, the responsibility of Her Majesty’s Government is in our judgment more directly involved. In the eastern sphere, and in the southern or maritime sphere, we admit a corresponding preponderance of Indian interest. 73. Commencing with the first named of these areas, we find that Sir M. Durand recommends an improvement in the pay and status of Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz. In so far as our judgment on the matter is desired' it is m entire accord with the proposal. We are more doubtful about the suggestion to appoint an additional Vice-Consul at Tabriz, with the intention of posting him later on at Urumia; since we incline to the opinion that the ultimate destiny of the Persian Yestorians has been irretrievably fixed bv their recent wholesale conversion to the Russian faith. We concur with Sir M. Durand as to th e desirability of reducing the Consulate at Resht to a Vicei Consulate. AY e have before expressed our hearty eoncurrence with his pro posals concerning the Consulate at Ispahan. These proposals without excep tion concern m their financial aspect the British, ai d not the Indian, Exchequer. a British ' vestci ; n s P here Sir M. Durand advocates the appointment of a Bntish Vice-Consul at Kermanshah, subordinate to the Consul-General at iehian, and paid for by England, m place of the present native a^ent whose modest allowance of £21 is drawn, for some unaccountable reason” from the charges for the Meshed Agency, i.e., from Indian funds. The figures of British trade passing through Kermanshah from Baghdad to Tehran appear to us amply to justify the proposed change. We are less confident about a suggestion made by bir M. Durand, originally in connection with this route but also with a wider application, namely, that we should depute an Indian officer to examine the various possible routes for railways in Persia and to make suggestions. Such a proceeding would, in our opinion bp Wli ™ ture and uncalled for. We are very doubtful whether in her present state of evolution I ersia is prepared for railways. The receut renewafof the prohibf tive agreement with Russia shows that the latter Power does not for t * at any rate intend them to be introduced. Enquiries of the propped chSe^ would be certain to arouse suspicion; and finally wo befiere that we are already in possession of the materials enabling us to iud&lt; e A f i , u very few in number, that under existing conditions t fould be prud 'nt'if it were possible, to construct in Persia. prudent, it n i -p ■ F i V rt ^ r to t]ie sout h Sir M. Durand recommends the substitntirm pf Consul for the Karun and Arabistan at a salary of £800 (to rii 'ri a i * the Imperial and Indian revenues) for the present Vice ri. i ? betWee: whose salary of £490 is defrayed from Imperial sources Hp /f Moh ® mmeral1 the abandonment at an early date of the handsome annual subsicW now paid in equal moieties by the two Governments to AWr! T i r secvicu upon Hiii Karim. 0 L ,™» „ lto r7[ 25 ] Tour Lordship for our ready acceptance of these views. But we think that the entne cost of the proposed Consulate and of such subordinate native agencies cannot tno reqUI w ?h0 n M b f by Her Ma j es ^’ s Government, since we cannot too emphatically reiterate our opinion that India is only indirectly interested in the Karun question. We shall be prepared to show a correspond- ing liberality m quarters of more manifest importance to India. A Consul at Mohammerah (or Ahwaz or Shushter) would of course correspond with the British liesident at Bushire, as well as with Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. 76. We next turn to the eastern sphere, where Indian interests may be described as supreme. Sir M. Durand throws out a hint that money mio-ht perhaps be saved at Meshed, where the existing establishment imposes upon Indian funds a charge of no less than £8,640 a year. We are inclined to a-ree with him. Although in view of the proximity of Afghanistan, and of tlie militant character of Russian pretensions in Khorasan, it is desirable to maintain an adequate British representation at Meshed, we think that the piesent scale is excessive, and that the results obtained are incommensurate with the cost. YY e are considering whether by a reduction of the grade of the Political Agent now stationed there, and by the removal of the Political Assistant to some spot where his services would be of greater value, we might not be able to eftect a considerable money saving, to be better applied elsewhere. We are sceptical also as to the value received for the large secret service grant at present made to the Meshed Agency, and expended in the main in procuring unreliable and almost worthless information through native and ill-informed agents. On the other hand, we are prepared to compensate fer a less extrava gant expenditure at Meshed by a more vigilant attention to Seistan, and bv strenuously fostering the trade route connecting that district with British Baluchistan. The political and strategical importance of Seistan appears to us to justily and even to necessitate the former attitude. We are encouraged to adopt the latter by the figures of trans-Nushki traffic, which have risen from a total of 1-| lakh in 1896 to Rs. 5,90,000 in 1897 and (in spite of an adverse season) to Its. 7,28,000 in 3 898, in which year the imports alone into Quetta from Seistan reached the value of Rs. 2,50,880. 77. W e have some time past been examining the question of the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and the deputation of Captain Sykes from Kerman to Seistan in the present year, and the sanction of an annual expenditure of £400 from Indian revenues upon a Seistan Consulate, have already been mentioned. The reports of Captain Sykes are strongly adverse to the permanent appointment of a British officer to Seistan; and whilst we do not entirely concur with his reasoning, and regard his views as to some extent coloured by other prepossessions, we nevertheless are of opinion that such an appointment might for the present be postponed; the more so as it appears likely that the nomination of a Russian Consul to Seistan, though previously announced, is likely not to be persevered in, unless a British repre sentative appears permanently upon the scene. Should a Russian officer be finally appointed, we think that there will be no alternative but to send a British officer also. In the meantime we are prepared to depute a reliable native agent from our Indian service to reside at Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan, and to appoint a second to reside at Birjand, the capital of Kain, both of these officials to be under the orders of the British Resident at Meshed, in correspondence with the Persian arrangements under which Seistan and Kain constitute a portion of the Governorship-General of Khorasan. We estimate that the annual cost of these two posts will amount to £150—£200 per annum more than the already sanctioned charge for the Seistan post; and this addition we are prepared to meet. In making these proposals we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are sure of the support both of Your Lordship and of the Foreign Office; since, in a Revenue despatch, dated December 2nd, 1897, Your Lordship, in sending to us a letter from the Foreign Office, expressing their good hopes of the future of the Quetta-Meshed route, provided that Consular protection and other facilities were furnished at points along the road, com mended these remarks to the Government of India, and added: “I trust that the suggestion of appointing Consular Agents at points along the trade route[ 26 ] between Quetta and Meshed may receive the attentive consideration of Your Excellency’s Government. It appears to me a measure desirable from many points of view, and especially in connection with the facilities which might be afforded by that route for the transport of arms and ammunition between the Persian Gulf and Baluchistan Since writing the above paragraph, we have received news by telegraph of the appointment of another Bussian officer as Consul to Seistan. We shall await the realisation of this announcement, and shall, in that case, he prepared to modify our proposals in the sense already indicated. 78. As regards the trade route in question, we propose to take active measures for its development within our own territory. We contemplate spending addi tional, though not extravagant, sums upon the better provision of wells, accom modation, supplies of fodder and other stores, and the protection of the track. We may even require to appoint a second British officer, to relieve Lieutenant Webb Ware of the excessive strain now imposed upon him by the administration of an extensive district, in addition to the protection of a road over 400 miles in length. We hope by these measures, which will be unostentatiously pursued, to escape the jealousy aroused by a too open challenge of rival ambitions in Seistan, and to build up in that neighbourhood a substantial commercial and political interest, which will find no mean ally in what we believe to be the natural predisposition of the inhabitants. Experience alone can inform us whether the anticipations that have been framed by the prospects of the Nushki-Seistan trade route are over-sanguine, as in some quarters they are freely said to be. If unsuccessful, the experiment which we now propose to make can be abandoned without discredit. If, as we believe, it will be found to have both a political and a commercial value, we shall be better enabled in the future to pronounce upon the larger schemes which have sometimes been put forward in connection with Seistan, and a reference to which will be found in the Minute written by the Viceroy. At present, it does not seem to us to be necessary to take them into consideration. 79. We agree with Sir M. Durand in thinking that a British Consul should he permanently appointed to Kerman. We have already sanctioned a contribution of Bs. 6,000 or £400 a year to the cost of this post; and w r e are prepared to continue the payment of this sum. We believe that there are good reasons for which Her Majesty’s Government may desire to continue the pay ment of a similar moiety of the cost. But should their acceptance of the increments proposed elsewhere, notably in the case of the Karun, be facilitated by our assumption of the entire cost of the Kerman Consulate, we should be prepared favourably to consider such a proposal; or, if it were preferred, to divide with them the cost of the Karun and Kerman Consulates combined. The financial result would in either case be approximately the same. 80. Sir M. Durand has suggested a British Vice-Consul, or a native agent at Bampur. Eor the present we think that the latter will be the prefer- able alternative; and we are prepared to undertake the outlay, which will not exceed about £300 per annum. The officer in question would be under the orders of the British Consul at Kerman. 81. Einally we come to the southern sphere, including the coasts and ports of the Persian Gulf. Your Lordship will have been prepared by what has previously been said for the announcement of our willingness to submit to some sacrifices for the defence of an interest, so substantially grounded, and so conspicuously assailed. We are unable to agree with Sir M. Durand in the sug gestion that any material reduction of expenditure can be effected at Bushire. On the contrarv we are disposed to think that, if the best men in our service are to be attracted to that post, we may even require to add to its pecuniary attractions. We agree with him, however, in thinking that the Resident at Bushire should reside at Shiraz, and exercise his consular functions there durino' the summer months. We understand from Colonel Meade that the cost of a site for a house (no suitable building being available either for hire or purchase) would be from £1,000 to £1,200, and of building and furnishing about £1,500. We think that this expense might be borne in equal proportions by the Imperial[ 28 ] \ distribution of the Telegraph subsidies, is vested in the Director-General of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Karachi, to whom a special salary of £120 is paid by the Government of India for the purpose. It has been proposed to us that this charge should be transferred to the Political Agent at Maskat; and for the present we reserve our opinion as to the advantages of such a change. It would be eminently desirable that Maskat should be connected by cable with Jask&gt; since at present there is no telegraphic communi cation with any part of Oman. But this too is a question that must wait for a later solution. 85. Sir M. Durand has proposed that all British Consular officers in Persia should have a small guard of Indian troopers similar to those now maintained at Meshed. We are not clear that sucli a proposal is at present desirable, and are apprehensive that it might lead to movements on the part of Itussia, for which not even the necessities of a plague cordon could be pleaded in justifi cation, and which would scarcely be distinguishable from armed occupation. In this respect we re-echo the ojnnion which the Government of India expressed to Your Lordship as recently as August 10th, 1898, to the effect that Indian interests are sufficiently involved to justify us in furnishing protective detach ments, as we are now doing at Jask and Charbar, for Telegraph stations on the coast; but that our military provision must, for the present, be limited to this service. 86. Her Majesty’s Minister also recommends the grant of a supply of travelling tents to every British officer in Persia. As the majority of these, under the proposed arrangements, will be upon the Indian list, the suggested outlay would require in such cases to be met from Indian funds. We do not think that any general rule is required. We are in the habit of including camp equipment in the outfit of any officer whose duties require him to travef. We may observe, however, that tents are more likely to be required in out-of- the-way parts of the country than they are along the main roads, where the existing chapar or postal service, although destitute of almost every superficial meiit, is nevertheless more rapid and therefore as a rule more convenient than travelling by caravan. 87. Lastly, Sir M. Durand makes certain recommendations with regard to the improvement and better organisation of the Telegraph service in Persia both native and European. We concur with his suggestion that no oppor tunity should be lost of getting the Persian wires, which are abominably mismanaged, transferred to our control. He then revives a suggestion, of which much has been heard during the last 20 years, that we should “organise for political purposes” the existing establishment of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; although we do not gather very clearly from his despatcli°what are the precise measures recommended for that purpose. The last occasion on which a somewhat similar proposal appears to have been made was in 1887 when a Memorandum, dated April 27th of that year, was drawn up by Sir Murdoch Smith, who was despatched on a semi-political Mission to Persia and who recommended that capable military officers should be scattered about Die country, nominally m charge of the Telegraph stations, but in reality as political agents. In a despatch, dated June 24th, 1887, the Government of India expressed a general, but guarded, approval of the scheme. In our opinion there are two sides to the question, for each of which much can be said. It K surprising to us that an institution and a service that have exercised such an influence and are so generally popular in Persia, as the Indo-European Teleoranh Department, should &gt; not have been attended with more visible political effect On the other hand, m proportion as the working of the line has become system atised, so there has been less call for the type of Engineer Officer wbo required during earlier and more troubled days. The work at the majority of the stations does not admit of much leisure on the part of the signal 1 pin and line inspectors. At the more important posts we believe that a consider able, though unobtrusive, influence is already exerted by the superior officers • and we are not convinced that the appearance upon the scene of a number[ 29 ] of English officers, whose telegraphic duties would in reality be subordinate to political or semi-political functions, might not arouse suspicion and even produce some friction. We do not desire, however, to pronounce definitely upon the subject, and shall be glad to be acquainted with the views that are entertained by lour Lordship. 88. Before leaving the subject of Persia, we desire to add an appeal upon a matter which we have already argued to be so closely connected therewith as to be inseparable from a discussion of our interests in that part of the world. Ihe proposals that we have submitted do not contemplate any change in the existing arrangements in Turkish Arabia. Nevertheless, we cannot too strongly state our conviction that those arrangements, financially considered, are unduly harsh in their application to India, and unduly lenient in their incidence upon Great Britain. That the charges borne by Indian revenues for the maintenance of our political and commercial position upon the Tigris and at Baghdad, should amount to £10,604 a year, while the contribution of Her Majesty’s Government to the same objects is limited to £131 a year, appears to us to be a partial and. inequitable division. We recognise that there are advantages to British interests generally in maintaining at Baghdad an establishment on the scale and of the importance that are associated with an Indian Besidency of the second class. But the objects for which such an establishment is there kept up are neither exclusively, nor, as we think, mainly Indian in character. The same remark applies to the Basrah Consulate, where Her Majesty’s Govern ment have recently taken into their hands the appointment of the Consul, while leaving the entire charge to be defrayed from Indian funds. Least of all can such a claim be made for the Tigris subsidy, •which, in our opinion, falls into the category of commercial arrangements properly devolving upon Her Majesty’s Government; although under existing conditions the total cost is borne by Indian revenues. We trust that, in any reconsideration of the case, a'more generous division of financial responsibility may commend itself to Her Majesty’s Government. 89. We have now completed our survey of the proposals that have been submitted to us for examination, and of the situation in Persia as it presents itself to our eyes. In commending our views to the earnest consideration of Your Lordship and of Her Majesty’s Government, we trust that w r e may have succeeded in impressing upon both, the gravity of the situation with which Great Britain and India are jointly faced, and the necessity, while there is yet time, of meeting it wdth definite and united counsels. We conclude by reiterat ing the confident hope, already expressed in our despatch of August 10th, 1898, that in the last resort, and in any sudden emergency, we may rely upon Her Majesty’s Government for the protection of interests which are vital both to India and to the British Empire. We have the honour to be,—SIMLA. IF O K EIG-UST EEE^lETMEJSTT. SECRET. External. Enclosure of a letter to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No. 175, dated the 21st September 1899.MINUTE by tee VICEROY on SEISTAN, dated September 4 th, 1899 . I propose, in this Minute, to examine the present aspect of the Seistan question in relation to our general policy towards Persia, and to the attitude of Russia in Persia. In my book on Persia, I wrote a chapter on Seistan (Vol. I, Chap. IX) which contained as full an account of that district, its history, inhabitants, features, and commercial and political significance, as was then (1892) procurable. I also discussed the political ambitions of Russia in con nection with Seistan (Vol. I, pages 201, 216-218, 235-244; Vol. II, pages 597- 598, 605), and the question of a possible Seistan Railway from India in the future (Vol. I, pages 237-244, 628-629). I ventured further to make certain recommendations, namely, that we should establish Consular or other represent ation {a) at Yezd, {b) at Kerman, (c) in Seistan, (d) at Bunder Abbas; (&lt;?) that the Kerman-Meshed trade route should be improved; (/) that a British trade route should be opened from Quetta to Seistan; (g) that the question of railway extension in the direction of Seistan should be considered. Of these recommendations, I am glad to say that, during the interval that has since elapsed, (a), (5), {c), (e) and (/) have already been carried into execution. In the despatch with which this Minute is enclosed, (d) is recommended by the Government of India. I propose shortly to discuss the present aspect of (g). The references which have been given will dispense me from recapitulating the elementary facts about Seistan; and I may commence with an account of what has happened during the past 7 years, leading up to a description of the status quo. 2. Seistan was in 1892 a beluk or sub-division of the district of Kain (capital Birjand) which is a part of the province of Khorasan (capital Meshed). The Government of Kain has for long been in the hereditary possession of a powerful family of Arab origin, whose head bears the title of Amir of Kain, and who, until the centralising tendencies of recent years, exercised an authority almost independent of that of the Shah. Mir Alam Khan, who had filled the post for over a quarter of a century, died in 1891. For reasons into which it is not necessary to enter, the younger of his two sons, Ismail Khan, known as the Shaukat-ul-Mulk (now about 50 years of age), succeeded him as Governor of Kain at Birjand. The elder son, Ali Akbar Khan, known as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, became Governor of Tabbas and Seistan,—posts which he only retains by the process, familiar in Persia, of the annual payment of a large sum in cash to the Shah. The third son, Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, now just grown up, was made Sartip or Commandant of the Kain forces. The Shaukat- ul-Mulk and he have generally, but perhaps erroneously, been believed to incline towards Russia, whose aim has been to get Seistan, now to some extent separated from Kain, re-incorporated in it, and absorbed as an ordinary administrative district in the province of Khorasan. Such an amalgamation would emphasize the dependence of Seistan upon Meshed, from which it is now in some measure separate. 3. Meanwhile the elder brother, or Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has not himself resided in Seistan, but has deputed one of his sons, Mir Masum Khan, a fat and lethargic youth of about 18, to act as Deputy Governor at Nasirabad, under the tutelage of his mother, a lady with considerable powers of intrigue. This son is supposed to intrigue with the uncle at Birjand and is not on the best of terms with his father, who in 1898 sent an elder son, named Muhammad Reza Khan, to supersede him as Deputy Governor. Upon Mir Masum Khan declin ing to go, the quarrel was patched up; and he still acts for his father in Seistan. Thus the local situation is that of Russia endeavouring to increase her hold uponL 2 ] the ruler of Kain (to whom she sent, a few weehs ago, a special mission con veying presents valued at £1,400); and the ruler of hain enccavouung o oust his brother and to establish a hold upon Seistan himseii. 4. Since the appointment of a British Consul-General at Meshed (in consequence of a similar Russian appointment) in 1889, Seistan n lneli is included in the Consul’s jurisdiction, has been frequently Tisited and reported upon by British officers either from India or from Meshed. 1 lie Hon ble G. JN apier visited it in 1892-93. Colonel Yate made a tour thither m 1891, and strongly urged the appointment of a British Indian representative in Seistan, to balance the Russian native agent, whom he found exercising considerable influence. He enlarged upon the wheat-producing capabilities of Seistan, the cncapncss of grain there as compared with the dearness outside, the advantage of export ing the surplus supply to Quetta, the utility of a postal service from Cliaman via Seistan to Meshed, in jd^ce of the Kandahar-Herat line; and he iccom- mended the construction of a line of wells and the planting of levy posts from Nushki to the Seistan border, so as to open a new caravan route for Indo- Persian trade. His report was shown to the Shah, who agreed with Colonel Yate’s description of the political situation in Seistan, and, in so far as they concerned Persia, with bis recommendations. The Government of India were, however, at that time under the impression, which has since been abandoned, that any evidence of British interest in Seistan or in Eastern Persia would merely bring down the Russians (who have come down without it), and would tempt them to extend their railway southwards (which they have since done independently of any British move). Accordingly Colonel Yate’s proposals were rejected. 5. Two years later Captain McMahon, who had been employed upon the demarcation of the Baluch-Afghan boundary (in pursuance of the Durand Agree ment of 1893), submitted a memorandum to the Government of India (dated June 21st, 1896), in which he strongly recommended the opening of the route which had been negatived in 1894, and the adoption of proper measures for its protection, and for the exercise of political authority up to the Persian border. The Government of India accepted these proposals, and submitted them to the Secretary of State in a despatch, dated September 16th, J 896. The latter replied on October 23rd, giving his sanction, and observing that—“ In the interest of the trade between India and Persia, it seems to me very desirable to further its development by this route”. In the ensuing month Lieutenant Webb Ware was appointed Political Officer at Chageh, and was instructed to establish levy posts, and to take other steps for the prompt execution of the new scheme. 6. This officer started upon his first visit to Seistan in January and returned in June 1897. He found Russian influence mucli in evidence in Seistan, where he pleaded for the early installation of a British Agent. With regard to the commercial possibilities of Seistan, he reported that “ Seistan’s staple products are grain, ghi (clarified butter) and wool. If facilities for carriage were to be improved, it is by no means impossible that the future may see an extensive Perso-Baluch grain-trade called into existence”. Upon his outward, and again upon his return, journey, he took steps, by the opening of wells, by the building of guard-houses and godowns, and by the institution of levy posts, for the energetic promotion of the new trade route; and he submitted a number of further proposals, with that object in view, to the Government of India. . Lieutenant M ebb Ware’s visit to Seistan overlapped that of Surgeon- Major Brazier-Creagh, who in April of the same year was hurriedly despatched by the Government of India to. Seistan, to carry out any plague precautions that might be icquired in that neighbourhood in anticipation of the preventive proceedings that Russia had announced her intention of putting into effect. His xepoit testified to the great activity of Russia in Seistan, and contained a glowing and highly coloured picture of the capabilities of the country, which, with a somewhat proleptic fancy, he designated the Pearl of Persia. “Bein' a lich grain-growing, large pasturage, camel and flock-rearing district, wdiose resources under proper control could be hugely increased, it might be turned[ 3 ] into a regular garden ITe described the climate as far from bad, and the difficulties of access from Meshed as greater than those from Baluchistan. lie thought that a large field was open for the import of green tea into Persia by the Nushki route ; and he strongly recommended the appointment of a native agent and assistant apothecary in Seistan. 8. A year later Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, Native Attache to the British Consulate at Meshed, and a very capable officer, was deputed to return to India by the new route, in the company of a trial caravan of Meshed merchants. Their journey lasted from April till July 1898—unfortunately the hottest and least propitious season of the year. At its close Maula Bakhsh, whose report is the best that I have yet read upon the country traversed, wrote that—“The Indian traders with my caravan, although disappointed by losses of camels, difficulties of transport and want of water at certain places, have not formed an unfavourable view of the new trade route, and they intend to advise their firms to send goods by it in the future”. There were wanted, however, better arrangement for water-supply, more godowns, and superior provision for storing fodder. The road was pronounced not yet suitable for merchants, travellers, or pilgrims, unaccustomed to rough travelling. Never theless the journey from Meshed to Quetta—62 marches or 1,090 miles—was performed by Maula Bakhsh and his caravan in 65 days. Including the average number of halts, viz., 10, he pointed out that the normal duration of the journey— i.e., 72 days, would yet be shorter than the 75—90 days usually occupied in traversing the alternative route, 966 miles long, between Meshed and Bunder Abbas. 9. Tn the same year, 1898, Lieutenant Webb Ware submitted his first Annual Beport, which, in spite of the obstructive measures adopted by the Russian officers on the pretext of plague in Khorasan, recorded a gratifying advance. In an appendix on Nushki trade, he pointed out that the route was growing in favour, and that out of nothing had been created a trade, which had risen from 1^ lakhs in 1896 to Bs. 5,90,000 in 1897. The main impediments were the total lack of supplies, other than those specially imported, on the road between Nushki and the Seistan frontier, and the illegal extortion of the Persian toll-collectors (many of them in Russian pay) in Persian terri tory. Notwithstanding, he thought that the Quetta-Seistan route would even tually beat the Bunder Abbas route to Meshed, because merchandise carried by the latter required to change hands several times in transit, because a longer time was required for the journey thereby, and because the road was less secure than one running uninterruptedly through British territory. 10. In the present year, the same officer’s second Annual Report testifies to a continued improvement both in the amenities of the route, and in the trade returns, which have increased by Rs. 1,38,000 since 1897. A new bazar, containing 126 shops, has been laid out at Nushki, which has developed from a petty group of daub and wattle huts into a small town; and which, now that the Nushki district has been (in the summer of 1899) permanently taken over by the Government of India, is certain of a prosperous future. Through out the past year a weekly dak has been maintained from Quetta to the Seistan frontier, in correspondence with a bi-weekly Persian dak from thence via Nasirabad and Birjand to Meshed. Alterations and short cuts in the route have reduced the distance from Nushki to Meshed to 954 miles, as compared with 966 miles from Bunder Abbas to the same destination. 11. An independent light has been thrown upon Seistan in the same period by the visit of Captain Sykes, who was despatched thither as Consul at the end of 1898 in consequence of the appointment of a Russian Consul to Nasirabad. Captain Sykes, who has for some time been Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, and who has been greatly interested in the rival Bunder Abbas- Kerman-Meshed trade route, arrived in Seistan in January 1899, with pre possessions already so strongly formed in favour of the older route, and against the new competitor, that before be had been there a week, be pronounced against the permanent appointment of a Political Officer to Seistan, and indls‘ldYantao'es , ^ These and other conclusions ot Captain Sykes u eie v ^ ow ^ J disputed by Coioncl Temple, our Agent and Consul-General a Meshed But they are not without their value, as showing the reverse ^ ^ ® h '? ld t0 J^ which has perhaps, with a pardonable optimism, been d &gt;fplfy e d by the vai o s officers who have been concerned in the inception or development ot tne enterpise from the Indian side. In subsequent letters, Captain byhes reiterated his opinions as to the superiority in respect of water, camel-grazing, and sup plies of the Bunder Abbas route; but so far receded from his original attitude as to admit that there was a great opening on the Indian route lor Hnpmte o f to and indigo, and that on political grounds its opening was important, affitao. “ The larger the parties that visit Seistan and the more frequently they appear, the greater the political effect will be On February 14th, he explained “ how necessary it is to provide the funds, by the careful expenditure of winch Seistan may be brought nearer to India ”, and urged that “ it is of paramount import- ance to take advantage of the proximity of our frontiers and not to allow Russian trade and influence to be pushed to our very door . On April 18th, while adhering to his view's about the superiority of the Bunder Abbas road oi cr the Indian route, he nevertheless remarked that “the Seistams generally, and the Baluchis in particular, all look towards the East and South, while their local commerce is now mainly carried on with Quetta ”, aud that “ the revrval ot the Seistan-Quetta route, the buildings erected along it and the other prools ot British activity, have helped to increase our prestige lie now advocated placing a smart Muhammadan native agent in Seistan “ to supervise the post which I earnestly hope will he made permanent” ; and in a later letter, on May 11th, he urged “the establishment of an Indian Post Office at Birjand, as veil as in Seistan, with a competent news-writer for each distiict , \\l)ich modest scheme should be sanctioned and carried out without delay In the last letter received from him, dated June 1st, Captain Sykes expressed his final opinion as adverse to the appointment of a British Consul for Kain and Seistan, unless a Russian Consul were sent (in which case it would become obligatory). It will be seen, therefore, from a synopsis of Captain Sykes’s reports, that, while he remains unfavourable to the prospects of the Quetta-Seistan route, as compared with the old trans-Persian road, he has come round to the opinion, which no previous traveller in Seistan has questioned, that it is essential that British interests, commercial and political, should be sustained in that quarter by an energetic and liberal maintenance of the line of connec tion with India, but that, for their support in Seistan itself, it will he sufficient for the present, unless a more active course be imposed by Russian initiative, to rely upon Indian native agents. These recommendations I have accepted in the draft despatch to the Secretary of State. I should add that Colonel Temple, who has throughout disputed many of Captain Sykes’s statements and dissented from his conclusions—partly owing to a not unfounded suspicion that Captain Sykes was advising in a spirit of undue independence of Meshed— has urged, in view of the recent renewal of plague alarms in Eastern Persia, that a native agent, if sent from India, should be a medical officer, charged in addition with the necessary political work. Although I believe these alarms to have been factitious, and to have been fomented by Russia for political purposes in 1899, as in 1897, I have so far acted upon Colonel Temple’s advice as to send a Hospital Assistant from Quetta to Seistan as news-writer and medical reporter for a period of 6 months. Such is the present state of our information, and of affairs, in Seistan. 12. It will be seen from what I have written that Seistan is, by virtue of its position and its features, an ob ject of much interest both to Russia and Great Britain. Situated at the point of junction of the frontiers of Persia, Afghan istan, and Baluchistan, its future affects the destinies of all three countries. Lying, as it does, almost midway between Meshed and the Persian Gulf, no advance can be made from Khorasan to the sea except through Seistan. Its position upon the exposed flank of Afghanistan would render its occupation ofgreat value to any Power contemplating either a move against that country, or an advance upon Kandahar. Nor will it he denied that the Kandahar-Herat line could not he held with safety by India, nor the valley of the Helmand defended, were a hostile Power in possession of Seistan. Furthermore, the grain- producing capabilities of the district, to the bygone richness of which eloquent testimony is borne by the immense number of ruined cities encumbering the soil, and which could without serious difficulty he revived by a scientific employ ment of the waters of the Helmand, render Seistan of much value, as a possible granary, either to a Power engaged upon a forward advance, or to a Power interested in commercial and industrial expansion. 13. The force of these circumstances has, it will have been observed, com pelled the Government of India to display a concern in Seistan, which, at the start, they were most reluctant to acknowledge, and which, at varying intervals since, they have, with unconscious inconsistency, affected to repudiate. I have already cited the reply returned to Colonel Yate in 1894. Between 1894 and 1898 the Nushki-Seistan trade route was, with the sanction and upon the encourage ment of the Secretary of State, deliberately opened by the Government of India; a Political Officer was appointed to administer the district between Nushki and the Persian border; officers were repeatedly despatched to report upon the country and to evince an interest in its fortunes. And yet as recently as August 10th, 1898, the Government of India in writing to the Secretary of State referred to the apprehensions of Lord Hufferin’s Government in 1887 that “ activity in the direction of Seistan might lead to a forward move on the part of Russia”; and gave it as their opinion that c&lt; premature activity w T as likely to prevent or postpone the future success of the new route from Quetta to Seistan”. 14. I am quite unable to understand either the force of this logic or the consistency of this conduct. The cautious and, in its motive, praiseworthy abstention of the Government of India from displaying any interest in Seistan, did not for one moment affect the designs, or retard the advance of Russia in that direction. Russian news-writers were firmly established in the district before anything more than a casual visit had been paid by a British officer. While members of the Government of India were writing notes to show that, if even a caravan route were opened from Quetta in the direction of Seistan, the Russians would extend their trans-Caspian Railway southwards, the latter were already at work, laying their rails from Merv to the Kushk post, and preparing the plant for an ultimate extension to Herat. Sir M. Durand, in a paragraph of his recent despatch, has exposed the hollowness of this plea; and I venture to hope that it may not figure again in our reasoning. 15. Similarly, I am unable to comprehend how—the trade route having been deliberately opened—any activity in developing it can either be premature, or can possibly prevent or postpone hopes which the trade route itself has been called into existence to realise, and which, without it, would have had no being. Either the Nushki-Seistan trade route is a bona-fide enterprise, upon which we have designedly embarked, in the main, because of its commercial possibilities, but also not without an eye to the extreme political importance of Seistan; or it is a fortuitous and foolish experiment, not likely or intended to succeed. In the latter case let us be wise and drop it. In the former let us be honest, and make the best job of it that we can. 16. I have no hesitation in recommending the last named course: and I do so, not because I am carried away by the gratifying, though modest, achieve ments of the new trade route up to date, nor because I contemplate for it an early and brilliant success. On the contrary I regard the obstacles and difficul ties as considerable; and, knowing the traditional conservatism of the East, I recognise that commerce wdll not readily be diverted into a new, and, at first sight, somewhat unattractive channel. But I urge a strenuous continuation of the venture, with an eye to a twofold contingency, political and commercial, in the future. 17. In the first place if we do not continue to show an active interest in Seistan, Russia will. If we do not give the impression there of preponderantt 6 ] tbe^mosTdirect of her paths. Looking to the future of J^ 10 ^ 8 ^ a^jr^ttssssa.» .i 10 — « f ^ .m doubtless follow the fortunes of the capital. . 18 South of this district comes that of Kam already possessing a semi-independent chiefship, which might very well he S kefhe between the opposing spheres. Seistan should, for all the reasons given, be included in the British sphere of interest. It is no exaggeration to say cannot afford to see it excluded. . 19 Secondly, a study of the history and features of Seistan, no less than of all modern reports upon it, leads to the conclusion that the future of that country will depend, as did its past, upon the proper employment of the immense water-supply from the Helmand that now runs not and goes to waste in vast lagoons, and reed-heds, and swamps. The greater part of Seistan is, during several months in the year, under inundation. Captain Sykes, m one of his letters, has estimated its present population at 60,000. In an °tJ ie L he las said that, under a proper system of irrigation, the land would support pei haps c tenfold population ”. In a third he has said that, if the Helmand were properly controlled, the population might rise to a million or more. It is clear, therefore, that the future of Seistan will lie with those who control the entire course of the Helmand. It should he in their power to turn the desert into a garden, and to make the wilderness blossom like a rose. 20 Now it can hardly be doubted that a day will come, when, in response to an external challenge, Great Britain will be obliged to advance to Kandahar. So fully is this probability admitted, that the arrangements for the advance, including the rails, the mobilisation camp, and the water-supply at Chaman have already been made. liV hen Kandahar is re-occupied, the valley of the Helmand will be occupied with it. Then will come the time, when the channel and the valley of that river, now running parallel to the British border, though at no great distance from it, having passed under British control, the regenera tion of Seistan will for the first time become practicable, and it will he possible to revive its former fame as one of the granaries of that part of Asia. No wise man can be anxious to precipitate or even to hasten that consummation. But on the other hand no wisdom in the world can greatly retard it; and when the hour strikes, it would seem to me to be as well that Seistan should be waiting to be regenerated by us, instead of having already been absorbed in the regen erative embraces of others. 21. Bor these reasons, I recommend that in the intervening years, the Government of India should continue, by constant, hut unpretentious, activity in fostering the trade route, in providing for its security, and in reducing its discomforts, and by a steady assertion of British authority up to the borders of Seistan and of British influence within it,—to build up an interest in Seistan which shall save for India an area and a market of so much potential value. With this object I urge that we should be willing to spend a little money—it will amount at the most to only a few thousand pounds—upon a venture that would be defensible, even if it were doomed to failure, but that appears, on the contrary, to be attended with reasonable hopes of success. 22. There remains only to he considered the question of a possible railway connection between India and Seistan. This question has been discussed at intervals during the past 12 years, and the history of the discussion is not without its lessons for the future. The first idea of some such railway appears to have originated with the late Sir J. Browne, who, as early as 1881, advocated a linefrom the neighbourhood of Quetta via Nushki, not to Seistan, hut to Safar on the Helmand. This proposal was put forward, without any reference to Persia, lor strategical reasons, namely, in order to prevent, at any future period, a Itussian advance upon Kandahar. It is interesting to me to learn from a study of the papers, what 1 did not know before, viz., that five years later, when I was travelling in Persia, and was first writing about this question, it had just been raised both in India and in Persia by a report from Colonel Bell, at that time head of the Intelligence Department in India, who in the autumn of 1888 marched from India by Kharan and Mashkel to Seistan, and strongly recommended the construction of a railway, and a lease in perpetuity of Seistan from the Persian Government, with a view to the grant of a great irrigation concession to Reuter or to some other Company. The suggestion was eagerly taken up by Sir H. D. Wolff, whose imagination was at that time suffused'with halcyon dreams of a regeneration of Persia by universal railways; and was recommended by him both to the Government of India and to Lord Salisbury. Lord Lansdowne’s Government in a telegram, dated January 20th, 1889, said that “ Railway extension through Baluchistan was regarded by the military authorities as a most valuable adjunct to the defences of India and as deserving of the utmost encouragement”. Sir H. Wolff’s proposals did not make much advance, but were reiterated by him in despatches to the Foreign Office, dated July 25th, and August 19th, 1890. Unfortunately in these, as in his original despatch of February 19th, 1889, Sir H. Wolff rested his defence of the scheme upon extremely contentious and entirely unacceptable grounds. He advocated it for two reasons : as a menace to the Trans-Caspian Railway of Russia, and as the saving of a long land march in the event of our desiring to take the offensive against that Power. This line of argument was completely riddled in a Memorandum, dated October 2nd, 1890, by General Brackenbury, at that time Head of the Intelligence Department at home. He pointed out that a single line to a remote corner of Persia could not counterbalance the position of Russia in that country, would not help us in the least on the Afghan border or in Afghan-Turkistan, and would be of no use for assuming the offensive. He concluded by saying—“By far the more important task is, not the con struction of a new line into Seistan, but the consolidation of our power there by bringing the frontier tribes under our influence, and by developing Balu chistan and converting it into a fertile base of operations. When this has been done, it will be time to push forward into Persia”. 23. General Brackenhury’s criticism was destructive of the proposal viewed as an offensive and strategical scheme. But a corresponding flaw in his own argument was at once pointed out by Lord Salisbury, who noted that the real object of a Seistan railway would be not to attack Russia in Northern Persia, but to save Southern Persia from falling into her grasp, which could be done either by a line from Quetta, or, as he would himself prefer, by a line from the sea. 24. General Brackenhury’s criticism was sent out to the Government of India, and was thus noted upon by Sir G. Chesney on January 13th, 1891— “ The railway can only be regarded as a work of military jnecaution. From this point of view it appears to me that the time cannot be far distant when it will be deemed necessary. Still more important is a railway from the Persian Gulf north to Seistan; hut the connecting link between this line and the Quetta railway system will also he found necessary”. 25. A little later Sir H. Brackenbury, now Military Member in India, again noted upon the scheme; and it is interesting to read his remarks in the light of his former opinion. He now explained (April 27th, 1891) that he had only objected to a Seistan railway so long as the Russian railway did not extend south of the Trans-Caspian line, and because to construct a railway to Seistan would compel her to make extensions. “ But if circumstances should change, and if Russia should take the lead in making railways southward, then it may become necessary for us to follow her lead. We ought to he able to keep pace with her[ 8 1 * These [ndia decided to proceed no fur considered in connection with southerly line from the sea was a ie s Pani^ur—a project which Si, E.

Brackenhnry in London as precedent to anv idea of railway construction in this quarter have since been realised. BaSisten is rapidly being developed; the frontier tribes have passed com- nletelv under ourwntrol; a permanent line of communication with Seistan has been opened ; while the very conditions which he said, when m India, m.ght comnel a change of attitude on our part—Russian initiative m the process of Southerly 1 extension from her existing railway system-have been fulfilled hv the construction on her part, without provocation or incentive from us, ot the Merv-Kushk line. It is clear, therefore, that the question stands on a different footing from any that it has previously occupied; and that the facts and arguments which weighed with our predecessors are inapplicable to the present situation. , ... 28 As regards the physical and engineering difficulties by which such a line mi'ht he confronted, I may cite the following opinion from the report m 1897 of Lieutenant Webb Ware: “ No one who has traversed this country can fail to be struck with the marvellous facilities which the country between Nushki and Seistan offers for the construction of a railway. Scarcely a single material obstacle exists to bar the road; throughout the gradient is exceedingly 'entle • bands of sand can as a rule be avoided ; of fuel there is an abundance, while not a bridge of more than one span, or engineering work of any magnitude, is requisite. Added to this the mineral wealth of the Koh-i-Sultan and the hills to the west, at present lying untouched, is so considerable as m itself to offer very great inducements to railway enterprise. Such a railway would place the trade of Eastern Persia and Seistan at our feet, unlock such Central Asian markets as are now closed, give us a preponderating influence in Eastern Persia, TnrUn flip ripli prain fields of Seistan 29. It would appear, therefore, that so far as gradients, water-crossings, and fuel are concerned, little or no difficulty would be met with in laying a line across the 400 and odd miles that intervene between Nushki and Seistan. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that at present a very serious obstacle would present itself in the complete dearth of water over long stretches of this route, and in the problem of the shifting sands. Both of these difficulties have been overcome by Russia, though only at great expense, and with the aid of a lar^e permanent staff, upon her Trans-Caspian Railway. She has had, moreover, the°assistance of a settled population and the advantage of numerous inhabited sites alon' the railway line. These advantages would, at any rate, at the start be wanting in the case of a Quetta-Seistan railway. Eor some time the trade by such a line, though it would probably develop with great rapidity, would not be remunerative; while the railway would have no other immediate use.[ 9 ] inasmuch as it would not he a line of connection between important centres of population, industry, or arms, but would, so to speak, end in the air. If it stopped at the Anglo-Persian border, it would still be 90 miles distant from Nasirabad, the capital of Seistan.. The chances of prolongation to the latter would appear to he problematical in view of the engagements against the intro duction of railways, which Persia has allowed to be imposed upon her by Russia. The question of the military protection of the line, if constructed, is one upon which expert opinion would be required to pronounce; although, in the yearly increasing tranquillity of the districts which it would traverse, I do not conceive that any serious difficulty would thereby be caused. 30. The Government of India have in the accompanying despatch suggest ed the desirability of coming to an understanding with Russia concerning spheres of interest in Persia, which would leave Seistan within the British zone. In such a case there might be no necessity, at any rate for the present, for a Quetta-Seistan railway. We could then devote ourselves to the diligent promo tion of the resuscitated caravan route, and look forward to the day, when, the Helmand being in our hands, we might convert Seistan into a flourishing out post on the flanks of British India, that would call for railway connection with the lines and resources of the interior. 31. Even in the event of such an understanding being declared impracti cable, while I hold firmly to the opinion that we should then be bound to adopt such measures for the protection of Southern Persia and of our interests in that quarter as we might deem desirable, and while I concur with Lord Salisbury in thinking that a Quetta-Seistan railway might be found to be one of these, I am yet in favour of consolidating our position in the interim, of fostering the incipient trade, of acquiring further information about the tracts to be traversed, and of familiarising the Perso-Baluch border lands, and Seistan in particular, with our presence and influence, before we decide upon such a forward move. It would at any time be a comparatively easy task to connect Quetta by railroad with Nushki (90 miles); and such an extension would afford no inconsiderable relief to the Persian caravans, who now have to proceed with their camels to Quetta, where there is no camel-grazing and, where the prices for fodder are high, instead of returning at once, after a few days’ rest, from Nushki. But I should like to see Nushki also developed, as I believe it is likely to be, by an interval of settled British administration, and by the measures which I am recommending in connection with the trade route, before I advocate even this advance. In a few years’ time we shall be in a better position to pronounce upon ideas, the execution of which would for the present be somewhat in the nature of an experiment. September dth, 1899. CURZON of KEDLESTON. Foreign OfficePresa—No,'9C5—15-9*99—54.India Office, London, Gth July 1900. Secret, No. 14. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, Measures for the Protection of British interests in Persia. I have given my most attentive considera tion to your Excellency’s telegram of the 16th of March last, and the letter from the Government of India, No. 175, dated the 21st of September 1899, to which it refers, on the subject of measures for the protection of British interests in Persia. 2. Reserving for the present my remarks upon the comprehensive review of the situation in Persia and in Seistan contained in your letter, and upon the general line of policy which should be adopted, I proceed to deal with some of the matters of detail that are discussed in the correspondence. From the terms of my Despatch No. 8, dated the 9th of March last, your Excellency will have learnt that Sir Mortimer Durand intends hereafter to submit revised proposals for certain consular ap pointments ; and the broad question of the relative liabilities of Imperial and Indian revenues for the charges of British establishments in Persia cannot be settled without advertence to the Final Report of the Royal Commission on the Administration of the Expenditure of India, which has lately been presented to Parliament. In the meanwhile, I have given my sanction to the measures affecting the Meshed agency, recommended in your letter No. '27, dated the 15th of February 1900, and I have learnt that you have appointed an assistant Political Agent at Bahrein as a temporary arrange ment. You have also deputed an officer to Bunder Abbas as a provisional measure, and I await your proposals for a permanent establishment at that port, as promised in your letter No. 31, of the 1st of March last. In this way some progress is being made in providing for those parts of your scheme which are regarded by the Government of India as falling under its immediate supervision. 3. The subject of the administration of the Nushki district is closely connected with the matters under my consideration in this Despatch. I shall in due course receive an expression of your opinion as to the success of this line of communi cation with Seistan and South-Eastern Persia, and S. 21. A2 your Excellency in Council will no doubt consider whether recent events justify the preparation of plans and estimates for the construction of a rail way from Quetta to Nushki or to any further point along the trade route. 4 . I understand that Sir Mortimer Durand attaches considerable value to the influence created in favour of the British by the enterprise of Messrs. Lynch in Ahwaz, and generally in Arabistan. In this connection I invite the .consideration of your Government to a letter dated^Tth March, from th Eoreign Office, enclosing a representation from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, on the subject of a continuance of tbe Karun subsidy. The importance of the Karun River as providing an inland waterway to the open sea, and the commanding position occupied by Mohammerah at its junction with the Shat-ul-Arab, suggest con siderations which are of equal interest to India and to this country, and there is no doubt that the * efforts of Messrs. Lynch in developing the Karun navigation, and in constructing the road from Ahwaz towards Ispahan through the Bakhtiari • country have largely contributed to the mainte nance of British and Indian commercial influence in that region. I desire therefore to receive your Excellency’s observations upon the correspondence now enclosed. J 5. I pass on to the careful and exhaustive review contained in your letter of the 21st of September, relative to the present situation in Persia, and the course of British relations with it. The most vital interests of the Government of India in that country concern the defence of the Indian Empire against any attack proceeding from the borders of Beluchistan or Southern Persia, and from the ports in the Persian Gulf. But any measures which may be suggested for meeting or averting that risk must take into account the resistance which they are likely to encounter from foreign Powers, whose own interests in Persia and in the Gulf have been greatly extended in recent years. It is in this respect that the situation has undergone a material change of late. 6. As regards Russia, her advance on the borders of Persia and her assimilation of the territory absorbed by her in Central Asia, have ensured to her a safe stepping stone for a fresh move. Our base of operations remains on the sea while Russia has moved, and as she has advanced her influence has increased. If we lay down the principle of the independence of Persia, we are met by the fact that Russia has already gained on land a position which dominates and threatens almost the whole of Persia, and enables her, under cover of concessions and monopolies, to exercise a practical and exclusive control over a considerable proportion of the3 administration of the country. The very inde pendence which we struggle to maintain may become the most effective instrument which Russia can use against us. Already our influence in Northern Persia has yielded to the pressure of Russia, which could annex that part of Persia without our being able to offer any effective resistance. 7. Your Excellency is also aware of the course of events in the Gulf, which have already modified that theory of “unchallenged supremacy both naval and commercial ” to which you refer in para graph 12 of your letter under reply. Prance has resolutely asserted her right to a joint pro tectorate over Muscat with all the con sequences that may flow from the guarantee of 1862. Germany is interested in the development of rail way enterprise, and her agents have lately proceeded to Koweit. Russian ships have visited Bunder Abbas and adjoining islands, as well as other ports in the Gulf. In these and various other ways the unquestioned position, which was formerly asserted and exercised by us, has, even in the Gulf itself, been encroached upon. Though we still possess a practical monopoly of trade in the Gulf, signs are not wanting that this advantage will be gradually challenged, partly by the extension of railways to the sea and partly by the greater activity of foreign trade. It can hardly be maintained that, in view of such a competition, civilized Powers can be permanently denied the benefit of access to the ports of Persia because their admission will infringe upon a monopoly which we have hitherto enjoyed. 8. But these changes, which are the inevitable consequence of improved facilities both of internal communication and sea transport, render it the more necessary that we should closely watch over the objects and aims of our past policy in Persia, so that under the changing circumstances of the future we may effectively safeguard those interests and spheres of influence in Persia which are essential to India. Your Excellency discusses the possibility of coming to an agreement with Prussia, as _ to the spheres of influence to be exercised respectively m Persia by the two countries. There is much to be said in favour of such an understanding, if it could be established and maintained. But the probability is, that if anv such overtures were made by ller Maiesty’s Government to the Russian Eoreign Office, the Shah would be informed of the proposal in such a manner as possibly to convey to his mind the idea that the partition of his territories between Great Britain and Russia was the immediate object of the present policy of Great Britain. Eor these and other reasons I see no advantage at present in making any such proposals to S. 21. A 24 the 'Russian Government, or in making any fresh announcement to the Shah’s Government on the subiect of our settled and declared policy m Southern Persia. We have, at the present moment, great trading interests in the Persian Gulf, we have a frontier conterminous with Eastern Persia, and the limits of the protected State of Khelat extend to the sea board. We are under treaty engagements with the trucial chiefs in the Gulf, and they look to us to protect their rights. If ever Persia or the Sultan of Muscat should prove unable to maintain order or repress disturbance on their seaboards, we have, from the overwhelming character of our com mercial interests, the prior claim to step in and maintain order in the Persian vjulf. Ihe only question is how far recent events and concessions require that fresh action should be taken to reserve this claim and maintain our rights, in view oi: the gradual intrusion of other foreign interests into fresh spheres of influence and territory. 9. Her Majesty’s Government has, as your Lord- ship is aware, taken two steps of late which may lead to important results, and which have impressed upon the Persian Government a sense of the grave issues involved in losing sight of the legitimate interests ot Great Britain and India in the ports of the Gulf and in Southern Persia. On the 15th of April 1S99 Lord Salisbury informed the Persian Government that “ Her Majesty’s “ Government felt it to he their duty to renew the “ intimation that it would not be compatible with “ the interests of the British Empire that any “ European Power should exercise control or “ jurisdiction over the ports of the Persian Gulf.’’ On the 20th of March last Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was instructed to remind the Persian Minister for Eoreign Affairs “ of the “ written promise given by the Persian Government “ on the 23rd of October 1897, that the Customs of “ Southern Persia shall never be placed under “ foreign supervision and control,” and “ Her “ Majesty’s Government must hold the Persian “ Government to the strict observance of this en- “ gagement, of which they were reminded in “ December last.” 10. In regard to concessions for railways, the conveyance to the Persian Government of an equally precise intimation was authorised in the telegram from the Marquess of Salisbury to Mr. Spring llice on the 4th of April last, when a reference was made to “ the promise of the late “ Shah that Great Britain shall have priority in the “ construction of a Southern Bailway to Teheran, “ that if concessions for railways are given to others “ in the North a similar concession shall be granted “ to an English Company in the South, and that no “ Southern Railway concession shall be granted to “ any foreign company without consultation with“ Her Majesty’s Government.” The Persian Government was accordingly reminded of thi» engagement. 11. In the Gulf itself an examination of the ports, harbours and islands is being conducted, and further reports on the subject from the Captains of Her Majesty’s ships are awaited. 12. Your Excellency may be assured that all vigilance will be exercised in closely watching the course of affairs in Persia, and that whilst Her Majesty’s Government do not propose to adopt for the moment any departure from their past line of action, they readily admit that the conditions there may so alter as to necessitate some change in the pro cedure and measures required for protecting Indian interests in Persia. In the meanwhile your Ex cellency in Council is considering the subject of military preparations and the scheme of defence discussed in my Secret Despatch No. 5, dated the 23rd of February last, and I have under my con sideration your letter No. 51 (Secret, Military Department) dated the 29th of March 1900. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) George Hamilton.ENCLOSURES. Eoreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office. Sir&gt; 7tli March 1900. With reference to your letter of the 23rd of January last, 1 arn directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, in which they represent the insufficiency of the grant of one thousand pounds (1,000/.) recently made to them for the present year, and renew their original request for a fixed subvention of two thousand pounds (2,000/.) a year for a further period of five years. Lord Salisbury will be obliged if Lord George Hamilton will favour him with any observations he may have to offer on this letter at his early convenience. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State T. H. Sanderson. for India. Sub-Enclosure 1. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to the Foreign Office. 3, Salters’ Hall Court, London, E.C., Si rj 2nd March 1900. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st ultimo, on the subject of the subsidy hitherto granted by Government towards the maintenance of the Karun Service, intimating that Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have decided to grant in equal shares a sum of 1,000/. towards any deficit that may appear during the present year on the working of the service. While requesting you to express to Government their thanks for this grant, my Board desire to point out that a great part of the sum partially 'covered by the grant has already been anticipated and placed bevond their control. With regard to the amount of the grant and the terms upon which it is made, my Directors have grave doubts whether they are justified in continuing' the enterprise unless they can satisfy the shareholders that the Government will continue to give such needful support in the future as they have in the past, whilst the trade and communications are in process of development. 1. Apart from the losses which have been incurred by running the steamers, a net sum of 13,460/. in 10 years, there has been large outlay in the construction of the road from Ahwaz to Ispahan, a distance of 270 miles, crossing two rivers where substantial iron bridges have been provided, one having been built and the other being in course of construction. This road, which has been made by Messrs. Lynch without taking any remuneration whatever for their services, and from which any profits will accrue solely to the Bakhtiari, may, it is hoped, serve the double purpose of feeding the traffic of the steamers and developing British trade and influence in Southern Persia, but nothing has been asked from Government towards this most useful work.Although the Bakhtiari are under engagement to maintain the roaa the chiefs display little interest in regard to it, and it becomes increasingly evident that we shall have to appoint and pay an engineer to see this is done. In the selection of this engineer special care will be taken to get a man who may be counted upon to maintain friendly relations with the Bakhtiari, and it is needful that this should be done as soon as possible. There are other items of a similar nature which it may not be necessary to give in detail, but of which the burden is likely to fall at least in part upon ourselves. An indemnity of 2,000/. per annum would only defray a small portion of the excess of expenditure over revenue for which provision will have to be made if the enterprise is to be continued and promoted in a proper manner. But my Board consider that this indemnity should be made a fixed subsidy, owing to the large payments which we are continually called upon to make on capital account, or as advances to the Persian Government. The annexed statement will explain what we mean. Up to date we have expended about 31,500/. from our own funds, of which about 7,300/. may be regarded as spent on capital account, being represented by the Ispahan road, and 1,600/. as advances to the Persian Government, being our out-of-pocket expenses incurred in running the “ Shushan.” Expenditure of this nature is not included in the accounts which we render to our own Government; nor can it be properly so included. Yet the risk incurred is great. We have heard it said that our agents, Messrs. Lynch Brothers, are making large profits out of the enterprise. This is not the case. The only profits which it is possible for them to make in connection with this undertaking are derived from their business as merchants ; and we have ascertained that the figures under this head during the last few years are as follows :—In 1896 they made a profit of about 900/. ; in 1897 a loss of 100/.; in 1898 a profit of 100/.; in 1899 a profit of about 350/. On the other hand, Messrs. Lynch, have now for ten years given the entire services of their principal manager abroad to the interests of the Karun undertaking; and his salary, which would absorb all these profits, does not represent the measure of the sacrifice which they have found it necessary to make by detaching him from the established business of their firm. 2. Arrangements require to be made so long beforehand that five years is the shortest term which should be fixed by Government as the period of their contribution. We may mention in this connection that five years is the usual term of the agreements -with all the European employes. In conclusion my Board desire to point out that the Karun Service not only supplies commercial but also postal facilities, for which no payment is made. Were we to refuse to care for and carrv letters and documents commerce would suffer; yet we can get nothing out of the Persian Government in return for our services in this respect. Neither the Persian Government nor the Bakhtiari are prepared to spend even the smallest sum in return for prospective advantages. We trust that Her Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, taking all these facts into consideration, will agree to grant this Company a fixed subvention of 2,000/. per annum for a further five years; and we should be greatly obliged if the decision of Government could be communicated to us at an early date, in order that, should Government not desire to assist us further in the enterprise, we may be enabled to take steps as soon as possible for the recoverv of at least a portion of our large outlay.

HAMILTON, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 6th September 1900. My Lord, We have had the honour to receive the reply of Your Lordship dated July 6th, 1900, to our letter of the 21st September 1899 and our telegram of 16th March 1900, concerning the protection of British interests in Persia. 2. The first four paragraphs of Your Lordship’s reply relate to matters, such as Consular appointments in Persia (concerning which we may observe that we have as yet heard nothing more of the revised proposals of Sir M. Durand), the question of a Quetta-Nushki-Seistan Railway, and the Karun subsidy—upon all of which we shall address Your Lordship independently. The remainder of the despatch furnishes us with the views of Her Majesty’s Government upon the wider subject, raised in our original letter, namely, the policy to be pursued for the defence of British interests in Persia, and notably in Southern Persia, as a whole. 3. We are grateful to Your Lordship fot this cemmunication of the views of Her Majesty’s Government. We accept the statement that events are occurring in Persia which, even since our despatch of September 1899 was written, have modified the situation, not to the advantage of Great Britain. Indeed we ourselves a year ago made the probability of such a chano*e, of which there were already signs, the ground for an appeal for an early decision and for early action on the part of Her Majesty’s Government. The foliowino* were our words :— “We press for an early decision and for early action, since, unless we bestir ourselves, there is good reason for fearing that the already trembling balance may be disturbed by others to our disadvantage The conclusion of the Russo-Persian loan a few months later more than justified these fears ; while the events to which Your Lordship alludes in the 7th paragraph of your reply indicate that the activity of foreign Powers in Persia and its neighbourhood has not slackened, but has on the contrary increased during the interval. This process may be expected in our opinion to continue; and we think that it will demand constant precaution and unremitting vigilance.4. It does not perhaps behove us to comment at any length upon the several propositions which have been laid down by Your 01( ^ 11 P* ^ ar( { ourselves far from admitting that the position gamec enables her as yet “ to dominate and threaten almost the whole ot lersia . We think that the extent to which she is permitted to do so still depends even more upon the action of Her Majesty’s Government than it does upon her owm Neither do we recognise any reflection of our own views or utterances in the remark that “ it can hardly he maintained that, in view of foreign competition^ civilised Powers can he permanently denied the benefit of access to the ports or Persia, because their admission will infringe upon a monopoly which we have hitherto enjoyed If the reference is to access by sea, clearly such approach never has been or would ever be likely to be denied by Great Pntam. It t ic reference is to access by land, we have never said anything to deprecate the con nection of the Persian ports by railway with the interior, and the free use ot such ports by the subjects or merchandise of foreign Powers. hat we ha've all along deprecated and must continue to deprecate is that any such railways leading to ports within a sphere in which Pritish interests are unquestionably predomi nant, and in which it cannot be alleged that any other foreign Power possesses any interest comparable with our own—should be constructed as the instruments of political or military ambition, and should terminate in maritime exits, which might before long be converted into the coaling stations or the navul bases of foreign fleets. We have no objection whatever to the construction of railways in the south or in any other part of Persia, though we entertain tho liveliest doubt as to whether in a country so backward and so mountainous they would ever repay the expense of construction. All that we maintain is that, if Persia decides to construct railways in the south, she should not do so except with our consent, and, if possible, with our co-operation; and that the so-called development of the country should not be made an excuse for open and flagrant detriment to British interests. 5. We rejoice to think that on this point we share the views that are apparently held by Her Majesty’s Government. At least this is the inference that we draw from the intimation that was authorised by the Marquess of Salisbury to the Persian Government on the 4th April last, in which the present Shah was reminded of the promise of his father, the late Shah, “ that no southern railway concession shall be granted to any foreign company with out consultation with Her Majesty’s Government ”. We confess, however, to a doubt whether the general character or the particular terms of this pledge are such as altogether to preclude the Persian Government from entering into engagements, even with regard to railway matters in Southern Persia, with a foreign Power or Powers, which might violate the spirit, even while observing the letter of the late Shah’s promise, and which might be extremely injurious to the interests which it is our duty to defend. We are fortified in this view by the fact that, in the few months that have elapsed since the present Shah was reminded of this promise, parties of Bussian Engineers, with Persian passports, Persian escorts, and Persian official encourage ment, have been openly travelling about Southern Persia, inspecting and surveying the lines of possible railways, and concluding their studies by a close investigation of the character and capabilities of the terminal ports on the Persian Gulf. These proceedings appear to us to reflect no small suspicion upon the attitude of the Persian Government, and do not encourage us to look with great hopefulness to the future. 6. We are also gratified to hear that the Persian Government has been reminded, both of another written engagement, entered into by the late Shah, to the effect that “ the customs of Southern Persia shall never be placed under foreign supervision and control”, and of Lord Salisbury’s intimation of April 1899, that “it would not be compatible with the interests of the British Empire that any European Power should exercise control or jurisdiction over the ports of the Persian Gulf ”. The value of these guarantees appears to us to depend entirely upon the manner in which they continue to be interpreted by the Persian, and to be defended by Her Majesty’s Government. If faithfully observed and3 resolutely enforced, if no attempt to evade or elude them on the part of others he permitted, they represent in substance the policy for which the Government of India, with an insistence that is justified by the magnitude of the stake, has throughout contended. If any doubt as to their efficacy he permissible, it can only he because of the difficulty of placing implicit reliance upon the assurances of a feeble Oriental State, and because they appear to us to he somewhat in advance of the less definite propositions that have found a place in the earlier paragraphs of Your l/ordship’s despatch, ior instance, when Your Lordship speaks in paragraph 8 of the importance, of safeguarding those spheres of influence in Persia which are essential to India, we should have been glad to know what, in Your Lordship’s judgment, they are. Our own views on the matter were very clearly laid down in our despatch of last September ; hut we have not been informed whether they are or are not concurred in by Her Majesty’s Government. The successful defence, either of a sphere ot influence, or of the interests which have grown up inside it, would appear to demand as a preliminary condition an explicit agreement as to the limits and dimensions of the former, and as to the nature and obligations of the latter. 7. Entertaining as we do these opinions, we greatly regret the abandon ment of the contemplated visit of His Majesty the Shah to England in t ic past month; since we had hoped that advantage might be taken of his piesence to invest with the fullest definiteness and precision the nature of the policy of Her Majesty’s Government with regard to Persia, and to Southern 1 ersia in particular ; and since we had relied much upon such a clear understanding for the future protection of Indian interests in that part of the East. . M e trust that an opportunity for making such a declaration may still present itself. We have the honour to he, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CURZON OE KEDLESTON, „ E. H. H. COLLEN. „ A. C. TREVOR. „ C. M. RIVAZ. „ ‘ T. RALEIGH. E. E.-G. LAW.

Subsequent events have more than confirmed the fore casts that were contained in our earlier letter, and have lent additional weight to our appeal for a clear and emphatic enunciation of British policy in regard to that country. The negotiations for a further Russian loan to the Persian Govern ment, and for a new Commercial Treaty, designed in the interests of Russian and to the detriment of British trade ; the apparently imminent construction of a Russian railway from Ashkabad to Meshed, the capital of Khorasan; the activity of Russian representatives and agents in Seistan and the regions contiguous to the Baluch border ; the obstacles placed in the way of the Nushki-Seistan trade route by Russian influence, both in respect of customs arrangements and of quarantine; the appearance of Russian Consular agents and of a mercantile service subsidised by the Russian Government in the Persian Gulf all of these circumstances illustrate the rapidity with which the weakness of Persia is being turned to account by her powerful neighbour ; while they also testify to the unswerving purpose with which the policy of the Russian Government is directed to an obvious and unmistakable goal. We have so recently submitted to Your Lordship our views of the imperative necessity of making up our minds as to the point to which these ambitions may safely be pursued without coming into direct collision with British and Indian interests, and of shaping our future action, both diplomatic and commercial, accordingly, that we do not propose upon the present occasion to trouble Your Lordship with any repetition of opinions with which you are already familiar. It is sufficient to say that the events of the past two years have but strengthened the unanimity and force of the conviction to which we have previously given expression ; and that, in our judgment, the question of Persia and the Persian Gulf is on the ver &lt;r e of becoming the most critical issue of Central Asian politics. f l hat these views are not substantially dissented from by His Majesty s Government is apparent from the telegraphic information which has reached us from Lour Lordship since the above paragraph was written—to the effect that the British representative at St. Petersburg has been authorised to speak frankly to4 » 1 -v the Russian Foreign Minister, concerning the ^^^andlevetoSment played by Great Brit ,in and Russia in the tuture maintenance and devexopmo of the Persian Kingdom. . ... ,, 9 On the present occasion we address Your Lordship with another though correlative obiect. The determination of the attitude which is o ie adopted bv the British Government in view of the conditions which we have 'described 'while to a large extent dependent upon declarations or pledges alreat y made Ind upon the traditional history of British policy in those regions must also be creatlv affected by a consideration of the practical effect likely ptlucecf upon Br ish interests in the future by a continuance of, or an abrup departure 'from those traditions. We take it to have been a commonplace of British statesmanship throughout the past century that m the Persian Gulf British influence should remain supreme ; and that, while at Bme could the commercial competition of other Powers be resent^ or legitimately opposed, yet the creation of rival political _ interests m that quarter could* not be permitted, without seriously compromising the interests of India and therefore of Great Britain. We know of no Indian Administration and of no responsible British statesmen, who have not subscribed to these views. More recently we have observed indications of a willingness in some quarters “ recede from this attitude, and to argue that the political predommauce which has been acquired by Great Britain in the regions in question, at so great an expenditure of energy and treasure, may with impunity he challenged by Others! and can safely be shared with them, and that no menace need ensue to British interests from the construction, for instance, of a Russian railway to Persian Gulf or the acquisition by that Power of a port and naval station upon its coast-line. Upon this subieot we conceive that no one has so strong a right to speaTas the Government of India, seeing that it is Indian interests that are directly involved: and we are confident that in any decision that may be taken by His Majesty’s Government, due weight will be attached to this plea. 3. We have, therefore, decided to send to Your Lordship, for communi cation to His M ajesty’s Government, in such manner as you may deem desirable, a Minute on this aspect of the case which has been written by His Excellency the Viceroy, and with which we desire to record our complete agreement. We endorse the view expounded by him that, while there is no objection to the grant ing; of such commercial access to the Persian Gulf, by Persian railways or other wise, to Russia or to any other foreign Power, as their own mercantile necessities or the expanding requirements of Persia may demand, the acquisition ot political interests or rights by the Russian Government in those quarters would he fraught with positive danger to the security of the Indian Empire ; and we hope that any such idea or proposal may continue in the future, as it has done in the past, to* meet with the strenuous opposition of His Majesty’s Government. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CURZON. „ A. P. PALMER. „ T. RALEIGH. „ E. E.-G. LAW. „ E. R. ELLES. „ A. T. ARUNDEL.1901 SIMLA. FOREIGN EEFA-RTMEIsTT. SECRET. External. Enclosure of a letter to His Majesty** Secretary of State for India^ Ac. 185, dated the 7th November 1901*MINUTE BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY ON RUSSIAN AMBITIONS IN EASTERN PERSIA. It may be safely assumed that the great activity now being shown by the Russian Government and by Russian agents in the direction of Khorasan, Seistan, Sarhad, and Eastern Persia in general, arises, partly from alarm at the success that is attending the Indian Trade-route to Seistan and the marked revival of British interest in that part of the Indian frontier, still more from a desire, while Great Britain is otherwise engaged, to accelerate that solution of the Central Asian question to which, ever since the apocryphal will of Peter the Great, Russian ambitions have been fondly turned, viz., the absorption of Persia, the connection of Russian territories by railway with the Indian Ocean, and the acquisition of a fortified naval base in the Persian Gulf. I propose to examine how far the realisation of these ambitions would be injurious to British interests; a conclusion upon which point is a necessary preliminary to the decision how far they should either be tacitly acquiesced in or openly opposed. 2. The argument that Russia can safely be permitted to secure a maritime outlet for herself in the Persian Gulf, and that it is desirable that Great Britain should assist, or at least not withstand, her in that consummation rests upon a fundamental confusion of ideas. Those who employ it fail altogether to discriminate between commercial pleas and political ambitions. It may be urged that, whereas Russian manufactures, in their attempt to gain access to Eastern markets, are at present compelled to make the long and circuitous journey by the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea, before they can reach the Indian Ocean, it would be an advantage could they be transported by rail-roads either from the Caucasus, or from the Caspian, to the Persian Gulf; although the apparent value of such a gain would probably be a good deal discounted in practice by the com paratively limited trade of Russia (which, however, may admit of a considerable development in the future), still more by the superior cost of land carriage over sea carriage. In so far as these are the ambitions of Russia, it is not probable that any one would seriously resist their satisfaction. They can be accomplished— provided the money be forthcoming—by amicable arrangements with Persia and with Great Britain. I am not myself a believer in the paying capacities of a trans- Persian line for many years to come. The country itself is poor, and cannot furnish either the capital or the traffic. Were the line, however, an open line, it might conceivably attract the Russian trade from one end, and the Indian trade from the other, which would enable it to subsist. It is also conceivable that capitalists might be willing to come forward and construct it—though were I a capitalist I should not be found among their number—and arrangements might be made by which, while the line remained Persian property, the con struction and maintenance of the northern portion might be entrusted to Russia, and those of the southern portion to Great Britain, a joint guarantee of the three Governments being applied to the whole. This railway might terminate on the Gulf in a Persian Port, open to the commerce of all nations, but subject to the Import and Export dues prescribed by the Persian tariff. I should myself regard such a venture as premature and as speculative in the highest degree; but I do not see anything in it that need necessarily arouse political jealousy or international complications. 3. This however, though the sentimental advocates of handing over Persia to Russian influence do not as a rule see it, is not in the least what Russia wants. What she desires is a railway built exclusively by Russian capital, managed and officered entirely by Russian agents, constructed not for com mercial but for political and strategical objects, and terminating in a Russian,as distinct from a Persian, port that would presently be converted not merely into a coaling station but into a fortified naval base on the Indian Ocean. Such of the advocates to whom I have alluded as at all realise this conception defend it upon the following grounds :— 4. It is said that ports do not give sea-power, and that a Russian port in the Persian Gulf would in nowise add to her strength, because she has no fleet adequate to defend it. This might be true as long as Russia consented to remain solely or mainly a land-power. But the answer is clear that Russia has no fleet (or iittle to speak of) only because she has few ports ; and that as soon as her maritime outlets are secured and fortified, the fleet will follow with no delay and in proportionate strength. If we project our gaze for only a short distance into the future, and contemplate the time when Russia will have secured the free passage of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, when she will have obtained a naval station somewhere in the Red Sea, when a coaling station will have been conceded to her in Siamese waters, when her position in Man churia has been firmly established, and when its maritime outlets at Talienwan and Port Arthur, if not in a Korean harbour or island as well, have been fully developed (none of these being far-fetched or extravagant hypotheses)—still more if a naval base in the Persian Gulf he added to their number—can any one doubt that the fleet would promptly he forthcoming, or that Russia would emerge as one of the great naval powers of the future ? 5. Secondly, it is contended that a Russian port and trade in the Indian Ocean would be absolutely at the mercy of the British fleet. This of course depends in the main upon the strength of our naval resources in Eastern waters as compared with those which Russia would maintain. The balance is at present entirely in one direction. That it would long remain so is open to grave doubt. But this plea rests upon a further double misconception which in spite, or perhaps in consequence, of its extraordinary popularity it is necessary to expose. It postulates that the naval base, once secured, would be left unfortified and open to attack. The precedent of Port Arthur does not encourage this amiable illusion. Just as, by the expenditure of millions of roubles, that naval station has, in a surprisingly short time, been rendered practically invulnerable to maritime attack (the same might be said at an earlier stage of Batum and Vladivostok), so would a naval base in the Persian Gulf be similarly treated. 6. .Next, the argument under examination entirely ignores what will happen in the long years of peace, and assumes only what way happen on the rare occasion of war. It is easy to say that were Russia to acquire a Gulf port, and to create a mercantile navy and a fighting fleet, all three would he at our mercy, should war he declared. But supposing there were no war, what then ? In ten years of peace, there would most unquestionably have been built up a position by land and sea which would be immune from any attack that we might direct against it: and we should no more direct our energies against Russia in the Persian Gulf, than, if war were declared to-morrow°we should try to bombard Cronstadt or to effect a landing at Vladivostok. 7. Thirdly, the familiar, plea is urged that if only we were to come to terms with Russia about Persia by which is meant the complete surrender to Russian aims there would be an end to Anglo-Russian rivalry in Asia and that the two nations might sit down together to work out the reclamation of the East. I regret to confess that this plea appears to me equally untenable. The plan has been too often tried and found wanting It used to be said that, if Russia were allowed her way at Constantinople, she would cease to be a menace to Great Britain in Central Asia. Will any one now contend that if Constantinople were given to her to-morrow, she won]d tear up her Kush k Kailway, or surrender her ambitions as regards Herat and Kashgar i 1 Onlv a few years ago the same plea was urged in China—“ Let B ussia but have a port m ice-lree waters, and we shall hear no more of Russian rivalry at Peking . I doubt if any one who has passed through the recent Chinese war will now endorse that theory. Ihe cession of Port Arthur to Russia was theinfallible prelude to the absorption of Manchuria; and it renders absolutely inevitable the ultimate B/ussian control over the northern provinces and the capital. 8. As a student of Russian aspirations and methods for fifteen years, I assert with confidence—what I do not think that any one of her own statesmen would deny—that her ultimate ambition is the dominion of Asia. She conceives herself to be fitted for it by temperament, by history, and by tradition. It is a proud and a not ignoble aim, and is well worthy of the supreme moral and material efforts of a vigorous nation. But it is not to be satisfied by piecemeal concessions, neither is it capable of being gratified save at our expense. Acquiescence in the aims of Russia at Tehran and Meshed will not save Seistan. Acquiescence in Seistan will not turn her eyes from the Gulf. Acquiescence in the Gulf will not prevent intrigue and trouble in Baluchistan. Acquiescence at Herat and in Afghan Turkistan will not secure Kabul. Acquiescence in the Pamirs will not save Kashgar. Acquiescence at Kashgar will not divert Russian eyes from Tibet. Each morsel but whets the appetite for more, and inflames the passion for a pan-Asiatic dominion. If Russia is entitled to these ambitions, still more is Great Britain entitled, nay compelled, to defend that which she has won, and to resist the minor encroachments which are only a part of the larger plan. Like many other students of the Asian problem, I have often pondered, at each stage from Korea to the Bosphorus, whether we could not, by a friendly agreement with Russia, arrive at such a demarcation of our respective interests as would enable us to eschew rivalry and to cultivate an amicable co-operation, if not an actual alliance, in the future. At each stage I have found that in such an agreement the giving would be all on our side and the receiving on the other. The satisfaction of Russian interests could not be attained except by an intolerable sacrifice of our own. Simultaneously my inclinations towards such an understanding have not been encouraged by a study of the manner in which similar efforts have been met or have been observed in the past. The better and the safer policy seems to be for Great Britain at each point upon the long line of contact to frame her policy and to declare it. The West Ridgeway Convention and the public statement of Lord Lufferin that its infraction would be followed by war, has for sixteen years saved the Zulfikar-Bosaga section of the frontier. Persia will not be saved except by some similar declaration. 9. I now proceed to examine the effect that would be produced upon India, were Russia permitted to gratify her ambitions by constructing a Russian railway through Persia, and acquiring a Russian port in the Persian Gulf. 10. It is not open to doubt that these enterprises, and the power for pressure and control which they would give, would be followed at no distant interval by the destruction of the Persian monarchy as an independent kingdom, and its incorporation, on much the same footing as Bokhara or Khiva, in the dominions of the Czar. The north of Persia is already within the grasp of Russia, and can be absorbed or annexed by her whenever she desires. A railway from the north to the south would be the link by which the same process would be extended southwards until it reached the ocean. The lateral connections, eastwards and westwards, might for a while be delayed. Sooner or later they would follow. A Shah might be left ujjon the throne, just as there is a Khan at Khiva and an Amir at Bokhara. We also have our Asiatic Princes in India, and we know that they are not incompatible with a European dominion. 11. But it may be said, why not let Persia be swallowed up, as the Central Asian Khanates have successively been ? What is Persia to Great Britain or to India ? A sufficient answer might probably be found in the history of the past 100 years. It is inconceivable that a succession of Indian Governments and of British statesmen for a century can all have been so blind as to have expended the efforts of a ceaseless diplomacy and millions of money upon an object which, after all, was of little value or concern. Even, however, if we4 brush aside this consensus of authority, and if we assume that Great Britain may in the past have placed her money on the wrong horse m Asia as well as in Europe, let us see what there is in the present situation to help us to an independent reply. 12. The subiect is two-fold, commercial and political. By the efforts of our traders during the past century we have built up a commerce (m the mam from India) with the ports of the Persian Gulf and with the cities of bouthern and Central and even of Northern Persia, which possesses an annual value of several millions sterling. It is not too much to say that we have crea ed this market, and that in the southern zone we still monopolise it. Hie political absorption of Persia by Russia means the certain proscription and the ultimate extinction of this trade—at least in every article in which Russia can compete with India or Great Britain. W here now is the Indian or the British trade with Tiflis, Bokhara, and Samarkand ? Persia would follow suit, and a system of carefully differentiated tariffs wouldj in a short time, deprive India of one of her best and most lucrative markets. 13. These considerations are sufficiently serious. The political ones are more so. The Russian railway to Kushk (where the materials are stored for the 70 miles prolongation to Herat) already places that. fortress within the . grasp of Russia, should she at any time care to run the risk of a casus belli with Great Britain. But the Russian railway about to be constructed to Meshed if prolonged, as is the intention, to Seistan, and ultimately to the Gulf, will dispense Russia from the necessity of crossing the Afghan frontier on the Herat side. Prom Persian territory she will menace the entire western flank of Afghanistan. She will command the Herat-Kandahar road and will render insecure any future British occupation of Kandahar. Lower down, in the unsettled tracts of Baluchistan and Makran, which we have at present only imperfectly brought under our control, there would be limitless scope for frontier disturbance and local intrigue. We should be compelled, at the cost of a great expenditure of money and of a serious addition to our responsibilities, to invest our authority over those regions with a more concrete character, and to maintain posts and garrisons to guard what would then have become a vulnerable, though it is now a negligeable, section of the Indian border. 14. The Minute which I wrote on 4th September 1899, and sent home to the India Office with the Government of India’s despatch of 21st September 1899, sufficiently indicated the extreme strategical importance to India of Seistan. The success that has attended the efforts which we have since made to develop the trade route from India to that part of Persia—the value of the trade having risen in two years from to 15 lakhs—has tended to increase both our interest and our influence in that portion of the Shah’s dominions, and has encouraged us to project the early construction of a railway from Quetta to Nushki, i.e., over the first 90 miles of the route. A Russian rail way through Seistan to the Gulf—followed as it must be by the political absorption of Seistan—w 7 ould not merely kill this promising enterprise, and close the one remaining overland trade-route (that to Yarkand and Kashgar is already nearly dead) that still remains open to Indian commerce, but it would have the following further and even more serious consequences. It would place Russia in control of a district ethnographically connected with Baluchistan, would profoundly affect our prestige both with Afghan and Baluch, and would greatly enhance the difficulties that we already experience in managing the cognate tribes on the Indian side of the border. If Great Britain is ever called upon to ad\ ance to Kandahar, as she will probably one day be compelled to do, an intolerable state of friction would arise between the Powers that would then control the upper and the lower waters of the Helmund. Moreover, while Seistan, if it ever fell under British influence, could, owing to the protecting floods upon the north, be easily defended against Russian attack from the direction of Meshed our present frontier (should Seistan pass into the hands of Russia), being entirely exposed, would enjoy no similar immunity. I might easilyp r t -4 # 3^ But-S T 1 hpHplp 7 •f 6 ?”i! 1 UP ° n thG st ^ te g lcal im P°rtance to India of Seistan. it will ho J f G ^ 0W . g T ral . ly reco ^ ized here and in England, Pii M t0 that a Russi 1 an railwa y through Eastern Persia to the LT+on G ^ eans neit her more nor less than the final loss to Great Britain of feeistan and that the recent declarations of the British Government as to our interests in that quarter forbid me to believe that they would acquiesce in any such calamity, lor my own part, if Persia were to hypothecate to Russia the revenues of Seistan (a move which has recently been under contemplation, but which I should regard as not less insulting to ourselves than would be to Russia the hypothecation of the revenues of Meshed to Great Britain), or to cede to Russia a commanding political position on that section of the border, I should not hesitate to advise that the Persian Government be compelled to cancel the arrangement. Such a peril can, however, be more opportunely averted by a plain declaration of our views and intentions in advance, than by threats or military movements afterwards. 15. Should a Russian naval port be constructed in the Gulf, and should a Russian fleet (most likely in connection witli the French) be called into existence in the Indian Ocean, it is impossible, either for the protection of our trade, or for the safety of our own shores, that we could remain content with the existing strength of the East India squadron. We should have to place the ports on the eastern coasts of India in a state of more finished defence than is at present the case. Our military and naval responsibilities would be more than doubled in that direction. 16. The question would next arise how far Russia would find it compa tible with her newly acquired political ascendency, that the main lines of telegraphic communication between Great Britain and India should run through Persian territory or beneath the waters of the Persian Gulf. Even if she were ready to leave them intact, should we be prepared to acquiesce in the control, at a time of emergency, of these lines by a foreign and probably a hostile power ? 17. It has been argued that, if Russia cannot in prudence be allowed a port at the south-eastern end of the Persian Gulf, owing to its close proximity to Indian shores, and its patent challenge to Indian interests, we need entertain no such scruples about a port nearer to the upper end. As I have previously argued, a commercial port, as the terminus of a commercial railway, may be rendered equally innocuous anywhere in the Gulf. But if it is to be a political port, and the terminus of a political railway, then it is equally objectionable wherever it be placed, and the mere geographical distance of a few hundred miles, or one or two days steam, makes no difference in the situation. Political control over Southern Persia can equally be disseminated from lines termi nating at Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, or Chahbar. Whichever be the naval base, the ships that lie there can equally menace Indian commerce, Indian shipping, and Indian interests. Moreover, while at the near end of the Gulf, a Russian railway to the sea would have the drawbacks already men tioned of invading the British sphere of interest in Seistan and Persian Baluch istan, of destroying British influence in those regions, and of directly menacing the British-protected territories of the Khan of Kalat—a Russian railway to the upper end, e.g., to Mohammerah on the Karun, would similarly traverse a region (that inhabited by the Lur and Bakhtiari tribes) in which British influence has hitherto remained uncontested, and where British enterprise has established an adventurous and successful foothold, and would terminate in a port which is owned by an Arab Sheikh whose family has been uniformly friendly to the British power, and which commands the main channel of the Shat-el-Arab or combined estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates. To concede such a position to Russia would place the approach to Baghdad within her power, and would extinguish the influence of Great Britain in Turkish Arabia. 18. The international aspect of the acquisition by Russia of a port at either end of the Persian Gulf cannot be ignored. Such an incident could not possibly stand alone. Under instructions from the Home Government, we6 » have recently submitted to them plans for counter-action in such a contingency, involving the seizure of certain Persian islands or harbours, in self-protection and retaliation, by ourselves. But neither would the action he confined to Russia and Great Britain. Prance and Germany would unquestionably appear upon the scene. The disastrous contagion of Kiao-chow would be reproduced ; and the Persian Gulf—for 100 years, so far as political predominance is concerned, a British lake—would become a second Gulf of Pechili, to be quarrelled over and parcelled out by the greed of rival Powers. This is no fanciful picture of the imagination. It is an indisputable deduction from the circumstances of the case. 19. Finally, let me contemplate the effect that would be produced by the concession of a Persian railway and a Persian port to Russia upon the general problem of Indian defence. A glance at the map will show that India would then be surrounded in a ring fence by Russia and her ally. Following this line from West to East I have already shown the position at which Russia aims as threatening the entire western borders of Baluchistan and Afghanistan from the Persian Gulf to Herat. Herat itself could be taken by the Russians in less than three weeks. From Herat to the Oxus the Afghan frontier is at the mercy of the Russian forces. The course of the Oxus from Charjui to the Pamirs is now under their control. They can cross it at any point at any time without our knowledge and without the possibility of interruption. W'e are obliged even now to keep a close watch upon the northern passes of the Hindu Kush. East of the Pamirs, the Russians have already taken up a position in the Taghdumbash Pamir, which will presently make their frontier adjacent to our own on the Mustagh Range. The fall of Kashgar and Chinese Turkistan is absolutely certain and cannot very much longer be delayed. Tibet will still intervene between Russian territory and our own on the north ; but already rumours of a Russian Protectorate have been heard, and a mission from Lhasa has been received by the Tsar. On the extreme east of British territory in Burma, we encounter the rival ambitions and expanding influence of France, whose aspirations do not fall short of the complete absorption of the kingdom of Siam. It is far from improbable that within twenty, perhaps within twelve, years from the present time, the metaphor previously employed will have been justified, and the Indian Empire, along the complete length of its land frontiers, will be coterminous with the territories, and confronted with the ambitions, of Powers whose interests are on the whole inimical to its own. In such a case— and it is no idle dream of fancy, as the future will show—we shall not be able to move, to strike, to advance, in any part of the world where French or Russian interests are involved, because of the menace that will stand perpetually at our Indian doors. Of the strain upon Indian finances, I do not at present speak: but it would be altogether in excess of our means. In this ring fence there are at present three gaps : the still independent kingdom of Siam on the east, the portion of whose territories lying nearest to the Indian frontier has been guaranteed by a Convention between Great Britain and France; on the north the upland wilds of Tibet, as yet impervious to alien intrusion; and on the west the dominions of the Shah. These are the sole remaining buffers that separate the Asiatic possessions of Great Britain from her European rivals. It rests with British statesmanship to retain all three intact. But it will sacrifice the most important of their number if it knowingly concedes to Russia that gratification of her ambition in Eastern Persia, the consequences of which to the British Empire it has been the object of this Minute to expose.
