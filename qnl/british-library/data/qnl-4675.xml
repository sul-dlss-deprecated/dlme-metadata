In the first enclosure, letter no. 28, dated 10 April 1853, Tronson relays information, received from the Agent at Sharjah, Hadji Yacoob [Hajji Yaqoob], regarding the efforts made by Shaik Said ben Thanoon [Sheikh Said bin Tahnun Al Nahayan of Abu Dhabi] to prevent Abdullah bin Fyzul [Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Āl Sa‘ūd, ruler of the Second Saudi State] from using force to obtain a tribute from Said Sweeny [Sayyid Thuwaynī bin Sa‘id al-Sa‘id] for the Batnah [Al-Bāṭinah] coast. In the second enclosure, letter no. 29, dated 18 April 1853, Tronson relays further information received from Hadji Yacoob. Tronson reports that Sheik Said bin Thanoon [Sheikh Said bin Tahnun Al Nahayan] and Hamed ben Sadairee have met Said Sweeny at Sohar [Ṣuḥār], where the latter agreed to pay their tribute, on the condition that they give up their intention of invading his territories. In addition, Tronson reports that Hadji Yacoob has stated to him that the Arabs on the coast have an idea that the British are going to blockade them and prevent their boats from going to the pearl banks.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x00000b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
