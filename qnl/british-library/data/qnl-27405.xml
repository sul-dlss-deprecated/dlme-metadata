Abusiverlanguage was freely used and was directed mainly against the British.who were accused of interfering in the internal affairs of the country and disr ?garding the solemn pledges of the Atlantic Charter. The speakers declared that the British, not content with flooding the country with their own spies, made use of Persian traitors and reactionaries in order to maintain th&gt; ir stranglehold on tht country.

Tlie ’Rasti ' of the 23rd July, No.354, goes on to accuse the British of being behind every war of recent history, of d'manding the gold of South Africa, the wealth of India, the oil of Iran, the wh. at of Canada, the rich s of Australia, the cotton of Lgypt, monopolies along the Danube, control of the Balkans. They are said to desire the reorganisation of fascist Germany, the continued existence of fascist Spain under franco, and fascist China under Chiang-kai-Shek.

Their spirit still hroods over IChorusan politics and inspires the incessant calumnies of the Hish- i-Tudeh against anything not Bussian. 7# That this virus has spread to Se is tall is indicative of the far-sighti dn'ss and energy of the Bussians. Their Consular ;igent, II •Konopatkin, was planted in Zahul in June 1944 and within two years has mane consider able progress. By all accounts he is an -nergetic communist who is werking hard and long at the es tahlishmen t of a sympathetic pro- Buss ian group in Zabul. Bven allowing that circumstor^oes such as the rapacity of the landlords, the corruption of the officials, the great deterioration in administration both in Zahul and elsewhere in Iran, have conspired to help him in his work, it must he admitted that he host to his credit a very substantial list of converts. Doubtless they are time-severs with no knowledge of or sympathy for Konopatkin's politics, but that they art to all intents and purposes hand-*-in*glove with him is a considerable triumph for the Bussians. 8, Konopatkln’s methods might not be cricket, but they are extremely effective, with the assistance of two Bussians and an Armenian interpreter he has built up a sufficiently strong l^roup in Zabul for the Bussians to want to convert the Consular .Agency into a full-fledged Consulate. But this latest intention of the Bussiaiis is not directly connected with Konopatkin *s hot-gospelling but with developments in India. Contemporary indications of the resurgence of the imperialistic spirit of the Czars in the Soviet outlook make it a truism to say that the Bussians have an eye on India. The road to India lies through last Iran, and already important sections along this road are zxsfi familiar with- Bussian slogans to take Communism and the Soviet way of life for granted* 9. It is not known on what grounds the Iranian G-ov^nv- ment permitted the Bussians to reopen their Consulate at 2abul. There are no Bussian subjects there and they have no trade conn'Ct ions with So is tan. This consular officer 5 s ’activitiesconsist solely in spreading communist doctrines amongst the cultivators and upsetting the s fetu s quo in what was before his arrival an extremely peaceful part of Iran. 10 . violsnee never Ioj of Bussian and retrogression political ihj mhs Tudeh propaganda showed no decrease in volume or during the period under report. Tudeh speakers t an opportunity of putting across their slogans supremacy and Bussian progress, and the rottenness of everything else under the s un. The loudspeaker that is installed uv r a bookshop on the main Meshed street and that sells mostly Soviet Soviet propaganda literature, continued to broadcast speeches ana articles of this kind every day. These articles art not only pre- Bussians but have bt an at times violently anti-British. Th. ; ir papers print the most obnoxious vilifications of the British and .imericons imaginable. The cover of one at their papers recently had a cartoon of Stalin pulling the ear of Mr.Churchill. What would h„vo happened to the editor of the Paper had he shown Churchill pulling Stalin’s ear can be wdl imagined. The Bussians have in fact of t .n shown that they have very t ?nder skins anu feel the slightest prioKs that may be direct ; j d against them, though they are quite oblivious of the crudities of their own propaganda* Becently when they purchased about 60,000 sheep ana goats in Khurasan and exported then/--then to Bussia a nullah Su-art-d larg^-seal - purchc;sss which, he consideration for the population continued th-re would soon he st The Soviet Oonsul-Goneral who wi have been assiduously engaged in the British much more malicious quick by this sermon and made an the Governor-General, requesting of pr o pagan da w as s t opp sc.. to preach against these said, w ere maa e w 1 1ho u t , stating that if this ur vat ion in the land, th his gan;; of propagandists spreading' ruinouss against than this, was cut to the immediate complaint to him to see that this sort 11. There are branches of the Tudeh ^arty at tho_ following places in Khorasan viz., Bujnurd, a.uchan, Durajcz, Sabzawar, Nishapur , Meshed, I'urba t-i-Haidar i , Gun abac, Birdaus, and rtcently, Birjand. 12. The last-named is an important link in the Khorasan-Seistan chain of communist cells, and was estab lished early in Kay* Bussians have be-n reported visiting this area and there has been much activity in.and around Birjand. The Tuceh party has be en slowly equipping a reading room and a club, and has a Buseian loudspeaker. Bunds were collected at musical ent ert..inments ,anu in the middle of Kay the club was formally opened. Character 1st- ically, one of the chief speakers at th.. opening ceremony, on- Mohd All Mohibi , a teach r in the local school, abused the British, reserving especially vile epithets for Mr. Churchill. 13. The opposition of the Hizb-i-Tudeh, so long beneath the surface, has failed even now to form into a coherent body. The high uxp-ctations that the Hizb-i- Tudeh would deflate like a pricked balloon on the withdrawal of Bussian troops have been rudely shattered. The Frisian Prime Minister more than makes up for the absent Soviet soldier, and patriotic Persians cannot help being alarmed at th? rising tide of Tudeh influence in public affairs under the Prime Minister's patronage. 14 * pi^ ma The religious le ader s in w hom gr ea t hop es wer e ave not been able so far to rally any conspicuous under their banner. They have considerable influence but they lask organization and a practical programme; they have no concrete counter-proposal to offer against Tuoeh slogans of bread and employment. The report of ^ate June that the chief Mujtahid, Ayatullah Isfahan!, will shortly be coming to Meshed from Naj af, has caused some alarm in Tudeh circles, as his prestige is very high ano c woru from him may turn the scale s of the elections against tne Tudeh Party. The latter are said to be trying to prevent or postpone his coming 15. The 1 an d lor d s , pr o f s s i on al m en a no mo r cha n t s, who could form a strong phalanx of opposition to the Tudeh eith ?r by themsoIves or better still by join ing fore e s with the religious elements, ar? quite indifferent to the masses and opposed to progress. If they appear to be taking an interest in politics now it is because the elections are in the offing, and the signs of the times point to communist soverignty if the Tuueh party carry any consider j - able number of votes. They wish merely to tide over the elections. That over they will be only too pleased to resume their corrupt ways until the next crisis aawns. Bven at the present juncture, with storm clouds overhead, they have failed to agree among themselves, and create obstacles around minor issues. Into the gap, with great promptitude, the Tudeh is busy inserting a wedge. LOCAL .IBBAIMS 16.

A Persian boy was beaten and a runour immediately spread that the jews had kidnapped &lt;3 Persian boy for use as a human sacrifice. An angry Persian moD; consisting mostly oi young hooligans, immediately collected in the Jewish quarter and bricks were thrown at tne houses&gt; smashing w in do ws an d d am ag ing o the r prop er ty.

In addressing the mob he was alleged to have said that as Muslims they wax c behaving very foolishly and that they were playing into the hands of certain interested persons who only wanted ^ pretext to bring in foreign troops to restore order. 79. On 5 Trading and wealthy member of the Jewish community informed II.IDs Consul-General that early on th : morning of the day of the riot some members of tn Hizb-i-Tudeh went to the Jewish quarter and offered to help them and tried to persuade the leaders of the ^ community to go with them to the Bussian Gonsulat :~G-;n&lt;. ri.. and ask for help.

SIX-MONTHLY POLITICAL SITUATION STPOPT ON KHOBASAIT. J uly-Deo Pi/fb er 194 5 0811 qr a 1 * The perioa July-Deoemhor 1945 saw the oliuax of Busslan occupation in Khorasan. Poll tica3ty'Ghe province Passed through one of the worst crises in its rtoent histoJry # and in administration and the economic sphere there was a general worsening ali of the situation* The 3ovi*t grip over the Province was tightened and Joviet propaganda emerged from tin' 3 hackground into the limelight and Hussian influence and coercion were everywhere manifest. Tudeh aspirations resulted in a recrudescence of the Persian national spirit and a general interest in political prohlema as well as a more intense hatred of the Bussians. The country*s leaders and corrupt officials fell fr^q,u-ntly under the lash of Tudeh speakers hut no .improvement in administration resulted, 2. A noteworthy feature has heen the smergence of the r-ligious element into the arena of politics. The Shrine of Imam Beza, which makes Meshed the Holy City of the-. Shiah TcrId, is exercising a powerful and desirable influence on current provincial politics, and in its hostility to the Tudeh Party the religious element has a very large number of supporters. Administration. 3. The civil administration of the province reflected the general decline in the political situation. During the&gt; quarter ending Sept -mber 1945 administration was at its lowest ebb. The Hizb-i-Tuu^h found members among Government officials and there was a consequent deterioration in depart mental management. The blame for this state of affairs can in large measure be attributed to K.»L. Ali Mansoux, Gov-rnor- Gen-ral of Khorasan. He has acquired a reputation for diplomacy which seems to be very doubtfully u-ritea ana he semis to have exercised tact only at the expense of national honour; if he was tactful hi was also lacking in courab-* His policy towards the Bussians and the Hizb-i-Tuaeh was simply appeasement at which his successor expressed amazement ■and disgust. So far as is known Ali Man sour played no conspicuous part during the military desertions in August; and after the suppression of the freedom front, which haa be-n carried out with the open assistance of Soviet tommy- gunners a^d had led to the unjust banishment of th-- leaders at the insistence of the Bussians, he interceded for lenient treatment only as a result, it is said, of the indignation that swept the Province. His protests against constant Bussiar intriference in the internal administration wsrs few and feeble. 4. By th-- end of September the situation had deteriorat ed still further. At the time the Governor-General, the Governor, the Chief of police ana the Mayor of Meshed were absent in Tehran and it was rumoured that they were all trying to arrange transfers. In the meantime Agha Mohammed Barrukh, pro-Bussian in his sympathies, Secretary of the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society, and head of the Persian Delegation that visited Tashkent in December 1944, was appointed Acting Governor on the recommanaation of the Governor-Ge n-ral, Ali. Mansoux, before his departure, farrukh was just the type of .man the Bussians and the Tuaeh wanted just/-o cO ttlt: L’Kty and just tlT-m* Hr gavr vocal support to the Irano-Sovit Cultural Society, was ohl-f speaker at a meeting ol Society ou the anuivsrsary o! the- ootoher Revolution&gt; publicly expressed the hope that thi donds hetwt-eii iian Russia would he strengthened, ana signed a telegram ^ crawling terms sent to Stalin on this occasion. luring th f visit of Kishawarzi, Tudeh deputy in the kajlis, the Tudt^h 1 -ador stayed with Harrukh and was visited hy at farrukh’s house hy local Tudeh notables. Man sour f s successor *s Gkpvernor-Gencral, Agha Fasir Itimadi, arrived at Meshed during the middle of December. He is an entirely different type of man to his predecessor. He appears to he capable and straigntfoiwaia, and he has had some very straight talks wa^ the boviet Consul-General and the Officer Commanding the bovi^u t^oupo. He was originally intended for the ^rmy and was educated at the Russian Military Academy in Czarist days, it is said that he speaks Russians as well as his own language and h seems to thoroughly understand tin Russian mentality* There has b-■ en a very apparent rise in puulic morale smeo his arrival at Meshed-, fqp Persian military auth orities of IChor asan have an extremely 'difficult task to perform and have done * ,x ' 6 . very well in the circumstances , tnanus largely uo. ba _ 'g Tossuq, the Officer Commanding the 8th IChoiasaii Division, 7 , The most notable occurrence in the province during th&lt; j period under review was the desertion of oar tain military officers from Meshed. Briefly the facts are as follows . On tha loth August 20 officers, using one nyP -w military trucks loaded with uachme guns a nd_ 20 ,000 rounds of ammunition , deserted from the Meshed garrison, j. pr event pursuit they put salt in the petrol tanks ox tn. other motor vehicles (sugar 'being a far too ^xpensiv comtxodity these days) and cut the telegraph wires on tnyir wav. They passed the Bussian post apper-noly without Being interrogated. It is significant that ordinarily no vehicles arc. allow'-d fo pass the Russian control po^t without being stopped and examined. It would appear therefore, tnat un.-. Bussian control posts haa orders to 1st these des , officers and their vehicles pass. They proo-^ded to Bu.)nu..c. whor^ they unsuccessfully attempt=a to contact Turkoman tribal chiefs with the idea of raising a Turcoman rcb^llic against xhe Government.

Needless to say thc s it action in India, British '’interference' 1 in Greece ana Java, the '’downfall'* of Ghurchill and the victory of the Labour Government (lat’r interpreted as a cunning imperial move) have all been used to support their news items and broadcasts„ . V c S P 3 . In Meshed the Soviet authorities assisted in ths sinking of a well in the Shrine Museum and made the most ot what propaganda value it had. They opened a clinic at the terminus of the main Meshed street and planned the ^ opening of a hospital. for this purpose Dr *Baroyati f of the Soviet Hospit, 1 in Tehran, ^ r;rmouroa to thiohb to the Bussian Secret Service, visited Me shed ana arranged a*meeting of local doctors. The doctors were nothin favour of the scheme, mainly for political reasons, but the BussLuiis went ahead and secured quarters ana appointed a local staff . .The schema has r ?cently be m abandoned and the local staff dismiss ed. 14. After the events of the last half-year it is doubtful if anything the 'Bussic.ns do will modify Bersion suspicions of their motives* The Azerbaijan -devolution oonvinced those sections of the public that still wanteu convinoing that the Bussiaus intended to stay where tha- war had placed them. Linking up the events of ^ugust with Azerbaijan they were convinced that the military basertiont w°r-- part of a grsat plot to secure the secession of the Persian provinces occupied by their troops. While fh.- troubl-- was at its height a Bussian loudspeaker installed over a Persian bookshop on them a in Meshed street which usc-o. to broadcast extracts from Tudeh ana Soviet papers, announce a. the independence of AZ-rb-aijan and broadcast an appeal to Persian youth to join the Tudeh Party and support the Democrat movement for the freedom of Persia* review con tre ana The Tudeh Party. 15. Political activity dur ing_ the half-year under is mainly the story of the Tudeh Party which h^Iu the of the stage in political matters and. gained ir: power importance. There is no doubt that Bussian backing has given more than material strength to the Tudeh. The orgca-i~ zation of the Party, the co-ordination of the various units, the high standard of Party discipline, are the direct result of Soviet influence and advice. The Party spread its tentacles into official spheres and there were oases oi intimidation of Government employees. Pressure was broughu to bear on former members of the Party who had resigned in order to make them rejoin and support it* 16«, Tudeh propaganda was plentiful in Meshed as well as in the districts a In Msshod the party organized meetings and parades, arranged theatrical and otirr enter to lumen t and made strenuous app--jls for support. They had some reverses during the abortive military insurrection because of the widespread reactions to Bussienx intv.rference, out seemed to recover when given the open support oi thr^ put sious after the Azerbaijan Be volution. November and Me cembor 1945 were the peak periods of Tudeh activity and the B^rty ustu persuasion, guile and force to swell their raa^s gua put -across ihxi its ideas for the hhorasan Bo volution* At tni s time the propaganda advance was made along a wide front - the Hi zb-i-Tudeh, the Irano-Soviet Cultural ooooity, end ' thcv~0 'b - 5 the Democrats all gave their energies to the task, conceal ing their obvious Bussian backing undorr: a thin veneer of nationalism. Tudeh leaders were conspicuous in Meshed after the closure of the Tehran headquarters of the Hi zb ? and during October and November there was a great coming and going of Tudeh members and a constant streak of speech-s by Tudeh and Democrat. There were few speakers who did. not reserve substantial parts of their talk for vilification of ' l capitalist Britain and her traitorous hirelings ’ ana to a lesser extent the Americans* The more serious prop^g^naa of th - Tudeh Party has always be-n supplemented by dramatic burlesques ridiculing the Persian officials, the Maj.liSj Syed Zia and American and British capitalists. Boononio. I'6 0 Thorr was no appreciable fall in the prices of general commodities during the period under review, out on the othr^r hand the prices of some foodstuffs like m tea, sugar and rice has ; risen. Wheat sowings were plentiful and price of bread has shown no increase. The worst aspect of th? economic situation is th- anticipated rise in tht price of wheat and bread, which seems to be pa rt of a widespread shortage. The position is aggravated by the increasing unemployment. 17. foreign imports into Persia were insignificant^ and included mainly American crockery, cotton goous and haber- dashery in small quantities, ana also Bussian glassware, china and cloth. It was anticipated that there would be r, large increase in imports from India after the war, but up to the time of writing export trade restrictions arc still in force. It is unfortunate that at a time when Indian commodities could find a huge market in Persia, the supply position does not yet permit of large-scale imports from India, Moreover, Indian traders in Bast Persia, some of whom were Established before the first world war are being badly hit. by 'one Indian Government * s policy of giving licences to India-based firms&lt;, .h goods which reason given 'or q n. : - 7 -i 301' IS. There is a great demand lor Bntm are considered better than Americano The this is that goods recently received from *ohe UAS#A. desorioc-u as second quality in the invoice and charged for.acca dmg ly were on arrival found to be third or fourth quality and in a great number of cases had to be disposed-of at -a loss c On the other hand British goods recently received invoiced as second quality (first quality not at present available(J hav c on arrival/found to be nearly first quality. This is gooa propaganda for British goods and the honesty of British suppliers. Another item against American goods is the present high rate of t he .American dollar on the open market. It is now 54 rials (Persian) to one dollar (.^mericun) against the official rate of 32 rials. The dollar was recently as high as 67 rials. This makes American goods very expensive e The open market of the pound sterling is said to be fluctuation between 140 and 160 rials as against the official rate of 128. Bo ads Sc Communications. 19.

The Persian military authorities renewed their efforts during the winter to disarm .the Kurd and Turcoman tribesmen of ohe Q,uchan and Bujnurd districts, but with oniy limited results owing to the venality of the officers entrust ed with the task. Eventually some 1500 rifles, iuany ox tnem antiquated weapons, were collected thanks to press are,-from the Bussians who secured the removal of the Persian commandant in Khorasan, Brigadier Khudadad, for alleged complicity in the scandals. -'The proceedings were complicated in February by the incursion of between 1500 and 2000 Tekke Turcoman armed desert ers from thv Soviet forces in Turkmenistan.

The Soviet propaganda Bureau which is run hy JEte-a ^ Army officers under Major pikhoulin, not hy the Oonsulate- General, continued to be very active. The political, cultu ral, and sporting approaches were all exploited with evoii greater energy and less tact than before• yell-to- 0.0 Peisians were continually being made to pay through the nose 1 or the privilege of attending immensely long and incredibly had amateur concerts and theatricals, the proceeds 01 which ^ they strongly suspected would be used to finance Sovieu and Tudeh propaganda among themselves. The u ^ ; ^ r . 0 ii? ss not deceived, merely bored to distraction, but the poverty stricken bulk of the urban population was less critical and the cumulative effect of the propaganda Bureau’s activities was considerable. The Hi zb-i-Tudeh, the freedom jjront, tne Irano-Soviet Cultural Associations and other organizations provided bread for the emotions of the lloshedis if not for their stomachs, while football matches and physical training displays staged by£3ed urmy supplied the circuses* 5. At Meshed little progress was made by the Labour Unions affiliated to the Tudsh in solving labour protlaas, while the main party confined itself to the usual meetings for the coimnination of ‘3yed Zia and foreign imperialisms other than Bussian. a branch of the freedom front with a Committee composed of newspaper editors, Tudeh members and a few officials and landowners anxious to placate their ^northern neighbours' 1 was formed mainly, so far 00 ^r seen, as a cover for the control of the press by the Tua'-h $ Party which had become more unpopular than ever with m middle and unper classes- since its unashamed cooperation with the Bussianin the North Persian oil concessions agitation. 6. Another alias for the Hizb-i-Tudeh was the Ixsmixnirano- Soviet Cultural Association, on the committee.oi win on several Persian officials willingly or unwillingly serve. One of the chief activities of this organization is teaching M-shed the Bussian langn ge, an uphill task. Though teachers were numerous and pressure applied shamelbssly, not 0 than a hundred students completed the course last spring, when in the presence of the Governor-General and other notables some twenty of them were presented with prizes and dfStplomas after speeches by the Gcvernor^General, president oithe Association, and the Sovist Consul-General, M. Abramov. Musical and dramatic societies were also formed among 'the more enthusiastic but not very talented amateurs ol ^ + Meshed, mostly Armenians and Azerbaijanis, propaganda meet ings thinly veiled as cultural lectures# and personally*' conducted tours-to the capitals of the Trans*Caspian^Bepub1 1 cs all are organized in ths name of the Xrano-soviet Guiuurai Society. 7. Meanwhile other centres in east and north-east persiaWr not neglected during the period under report. New branches of th-* Hi zb-i-Tudeh were formed in various districts from the yomut Turcoman country on the irauscas- nian border of Bujnurd do^in to .Birjand, while preliminary measures for ths formation of a local brunch were taken as\ 4346 Soviet gency Gov4jQiment nn ■ a- L J in tain Soviet - 3 ■ far south as Zahul where the a Consular Office and (Trade citizen exists within hundrei— — LJ the intrigues pf the‘new party have he eh' un'der oloee 0 Ds:rvatiQn the nephers are unnistakahly mere’ unsuccessful ' profiteers, place-seekers, 'blackmailers,'and would^h© dema-- gogues.

Our allies owe this to the Tuch-h, which /as was stated above is disliked more than 'yer. This is the more regrettable in that the Party, ost .-.nsihlly at -any rate, stands for the very things Persia rnyds most cleaner administration-, a fair deal for th t*nd'-r~d°g, action against hoarders 'and profiteers. It looks ! 1 ctuntry’s ohanfas of deliverahOe from the yoke Qi its . stony-hearted 'bourgeoisie are Remoter than ever, simply because id the minds of Persians the iaaa of revolu tion is inseparably linked with that of incorporation in the Soviet Union. - ^ ^ this belief they are probably wrong; every tiling points to a different or^utution of Soviet policy, Bussians do not thrive in hot climates and they are not likely no undertake willingly any responsibility whatever for to administration of a State which boasts some of the hottest ana most unhealthy country in the world. Nor are they in the least interested in the Persian tnidsrdog. But they are determined that Persia shall be ruled by a government, whether native or foreign, sympathetic to themselves and they propose to ensure t his by influencing the forthcoming elections to the Majlis through the Hizb-i-Tudeh and the Irano-3oviet Cultural Society. They think nightly or wrongly tna ;- a Persia, or at any rate a North Persia, dominated by al ] ^treoe left-wing party would be/safe link in one chain o± dtaues which is to form the cordon sanitaire protecting Sovi c Bussia against infection from the capitalist world.* PBB3IAN OZFAIBS Uo _ In my report for the second half of 1943 I expressed the view (para 11 ) that the Governor-General of Khorasan, Agha All Man sour, had long had a secret understanding with the Busslans by which they supported him and kept him here' as/- oinc - f He above w a s ~ wr i 11 e n, t lie jo in t arrest on BZnd July by Bussian soldiers_ and Persian police of 17 members of ^yed ^ia*s Iradah-i-Milli party, jusi} before the inaugural meeting ou. their Meshed branch, and the expulsion of seven of them from +v ''' ^ ’* - ^ — the len Mansour liber tiesEXT 4346 3 1 sas Covernor'-General in return for hix lU»Ae -prno order along their line of communications and facilitating the local purchase of supplies for their troops, gin.c^ then the existence of some such :&gt; you~scr atch-me-1~sorstGii~ you ’ arrangement has 'become even more obvious. ul sees that no awkward questions are asked about the piiceo, rents etc. Paid by the Russians, places his police at thwi disposal when required, suppresses opposition to the i-Tudeh, and blesses the efforts of the Irano-Soviet Cultural association in return for the unobtrusive backing of Red army tommy-gunners in tht? guise of military polio.= and diplomatic support at the Centra against riv 0 l cauaicia- tes for tide Covernor-Ceneralship. 12. ITo other explanation accounts for the immunity with which, as mentioned in paragraph 3 above, his ring oi official and unofficial profit .rs hay^ cornered essential commodities, created artificial scarcities, and gotu-raliy waxed fat on a high but conveniently fluctuating prico-ley..-.1.

No instance, he sent word to the Manager Sank that two of his.subordina tas who ordered to resign their membership on such ban exists on th? Hizb-i-Tudeh. In these oil cumstances it is not surprising that political parties others than the Tudsh should find Khorasan somewhat stony ground. The hopes expressed in a former Import (july-Decsmber 1943) that Tamaduun-ul-Mulk Sajjadi s '•Sadgustaran ’ (justice) party would, become a constructive fore : and its newspaper a pillory for greedy ofiioi^ldoni have been disappointed. Terrifi.d by direct and indirect hints from the Soviet propaganda Bureau his following melted away and the circulation of his paper fell off. Muring the oil concessions agitation of last autumn the Russians b_gon to make de tsrmir.'e d efforts to c.iptux'e 'che Madgustar an for their cause. Ih ?y alternately cajoled and bulli ed Tamaduun, they insisted on his speaking at the inaugui'al meeting o_l their freedom front, and they continually pressed him to ^ insert anti-Sy-d Zia articles in his paper• He went as far as he could to appease our allies but stuck to. his guns about Syed Zia and the oil concessions on both of which questions he refused to take sides. 'The Soviet propaganda officials redoubled their efforts and Tamaddun, faced with^bankruptcy, wound up his party ‘&lt;x:a paper and went into voluntary exile until such time as his country*s independence should bv restored.

The latter institution, run entirely by the ladiss, was very popular with the upper- class Persians who commented on the mod irate charges and generally on the good value for money given in the British enclosure. As a result of this policy, and a general tightness of money due partly to the '’Victory Slump*’ in Khorasan and partly to the shameless way in which the Soviet (military) Propaganda Bureau squeezed the Armenians and Jews--before even the.Bote opened, the amount of the profits to be handed over to the Buss inns when the accounts are clasa&amp;Jwiil e. probably edisappoin t them.

With the promotion of M.Maximov (an ex- soviet Juasul- General in Khorasan) to the embassy at Tehran a •forward policy• dnickly showed itself. i tough and relatively experienced young diplomat&gt; Mbramov, accompanied by an exceptionally astute and energetic yice-i)onsul f bahurov, appeared in July to take the place of the mild hnglish- spcaking Jew, hoalov, who had been transferred to .aiis &lt;*caba in January, detachments of ed troops were stationed for rthe first time at towns like tfishapur and Turbat-i-Haidari f well off the main Bussian supply routes from Jhahrud arid \Meshed to hskhabadj families of military and civil personnel were brought to ,ieshe&amp; 9 .uohan» Gabzawar• and other towns, and houses taken for them; survey parties with military escorts which had for some time been working in the province^ came mere and more into evidence. ,oi air service was started with military aircraft plying twice weekly between i’ehran and Meshed. r I3ie Xuaeh party took a new lease of life, a Proviroial br^Sch of the Xrano- x&gt;viet jultural moiety was inaugurated under the unwilling patronage of tue ^verncr- General and other high officials* tiie remaining polish delegatesi IQUBala aJid : uhlstein, wer’e turned out of lOiorasan at 48 hours* notice and their house ana offices taken ovgr as a •cultural centre** Bushian language classes were started in imitation of the British So unoil English teaciiing scheuig, and tiie urmenian and Jewlaii business communities were mobilis ed in support of concerts and other junketings in aid of Bed Array charities. 4 .

At the reauest of Mr.von Stemann, head of the local 'branch of the sdareh Par oar i Pah (Persian Hoad Transport Department), H.M ,Consul-General has been trying to arrange for the use of some of the idle U.K.C.C. trucks for the transport of 1200 tons of coal from the Chashmeh G-ul mines near Turbat-i-Jam, 117 miles S.D. of Meshed, to the Sugar factory. Of the 3,500 tons of coal for which the Sugar factory authorities demanded transport Mr.von Stem^nn has arranged with great difficulty to provide M.3.B. tr ucks for 2,300 tons and he is desperate need of U.K.C.C. help tor the balance. The Area Manager, U.K.C.C., welcomed the proposal as it would bring in money and keep his drivers employed. The proposal has also received the approval of Army Headquarters in India. Hut the use of U.K.C.C. trucks for the transport of civilian supplies aoes not suit the plans of pov/erful interests at Tehran and Meshed, and all sorts of difficulties have been raised by U.K.C.Q,. and f.B.B. Headquarters at Tehran and by Lhe Director of Commerce and Industry in Khorasan who is one of the Governor-General^ ihenchmen. The result is that nearly a month after the TT KBDe, trucks became available for this work they are still idle at Meshed and not a ton of coal has been brought in by them, Mr.von Gtemann flew to Tehran on 11th August in this connexion among others -aid it is hoped that he will oe successful in obtaining the Persian Government’s sanction and funds for the lift. Otherwise golden opportunity will be missed, for the railway breaches have been repaired and Russian supplies are already arriving in Zahid^n once more. U.K.C.C./- REoa. t-L.

Th^ . ..vO against three Persian clerks (two of them Jews) in the Uh .O.C, Stores Department aT&gt; Meshed for taking hrihes in ccrnexion with the issue ox spare parts to Indian drivers, duly came before the Meshed City Court on the 3rd August 1944. The Attache to this Consul ate-General * Khan hahadur Mchd .hyuh Ansari, attended the proceedings on behalf of the U.K.C.C. Although the Public Prosecutor as a result of his_ detailed investigations had strongly recommended the conviction of the accused on charges of khu kulah -ba rdari (the nearest Persian equivalent of criminal breach of trust), the Court after hearing arguments on both sides ano&gt; the statements of the accused, acquitted the latter without further ado. Not one of the ten prosecution witnesses, most of whom had given to H.M.Consul-GeneralZtne public Prosecutor straightforward firsthand evidence of the corrupt practices of the accused, was examined in court; the judge obviously knew all a do ut the case and had decided to acquit before the proceedings started. After consultation with H.11.Consul-General the area Manager, Mr.Stocken, decided not to appeal as it was obviousk^ that no Meshed court would convict. The Area Manager had already thoroughly cleaned up the Stores Department and K.M. Consul-General has satisfied himself by personal enquiries from drivers and others that “commission *-taking has oeen reduced to negligible propoartions. The accused had more than two months in jail and doubtless had to spend a considerable sum of money to get off. They have been dismissed and are being black-listed for further employment by British authori ties in Persia. The prosecution has had a good political effect, especially among Indian British subjects, its failure is ascribed as a matter of course to the venality of the courts and the low standard of commercial morality in meshud. As already reported (para 141), in the course of the preliminary investigations it transpired that a vury large quantity of Chevrolet spare parts which had been imported many months before from America had been sent to Meshed by TJ # K. C . C. headquarters at Tehran during the spring. The instructions were to r, get rid of them* as quickly as possiole in case the Bast Persia branch should shut down in the ne.ur future. These stocks were rapidly finding their way on x&gt;o^ the black market at prices between 400 and 500 % above U.K.C.C. schedule rates when the complicity of the local Stores Depart ment staff in the process was brought to the notico of K.M. Consul-General by disgruntled Indian drivers. So far as H.M. Consul-General can make out, these profits which run into millions of rials are shared in varying proportions by (l) the big contractors, Tufangchian, Yeganegi, and Dharam Singh Bam Singh, Members of the U.K.C.C. Stores Department s taff hern , • (o) the black market dealers in Meshed bazaar. The way of U.K.C.C. headquarters at Te^an with imported spare parts is curiously reminiscent of the way/Central Khurbur with Indian tea, sugar, and cloth. There is the same hoarding, month after month, at the port and the same eventual oozing out on to the black market when prices have reached a sufficiently high level. These things are the subject of much cynical comment at Meshed and Bah id an. 3/-Notes for Registry. Under Secretary... I Secretary of State Committee Under Secretary...

This is partly aue to favourable climatic conditions but partly ala# to the high price offered by the factory authorities for beet. 60 cents per kilo (600 rials per ton) as against 13 cents (120 rials a ton)in 1321. Ths sugar which was priced last year at 20 rials per kilo will cost at least 100 rials this season. The H bottle-neck' here, as in other markets, is transport. Ths bulk of ths crop is bslng brought to the factory from distances of 4 to 140 kilometres on camels, cf which large numbers have appeared from far afield attracted by the high rates the factory has been obliged to offer, namely 30 rials per ton kilometre for the first 30 kilometres, 20 rials afterwards. The black market rate which practically every Koao Transport depart ent trucx in meshed gets for private loads ia enly 10 rials per ton kilometre, but with the exception ofthe light l^aae-lenu trucks suppos u to be working for Government they are heavy lorries whicn cannot pick up beet In situ as animals, carts, ana some of the light trucks do, ana the latter can tnus charge what they like. ami tiSaiSM- bujtturq . 38#.

The return to keshed of the soviet Consul General on September 1st, the postponement of the elections! and the permission for elections to continue at Barajaz* where Burri (who is considered locally by many Persians to be a Bussian ♦‘man**) was sure of election, caused a mild panic among the xaore well-to-do Persians- The chain of events was read as a Bussian sponsored move to gain more time to put in their selected candidates and it was even said that the Governor General was under pressure from xsor.Kozlov to accept a soviet sponsored list of candidates. 319.

Recently the Russians have not Been so prompt in mov ing on the supplies handed over to them, presumably omng to the diversion of transport fbr use elsewhere. The U.K.C.C. will shortly begin delivering the supplies at Kuchan, 90 miles further along the Askhabad road, instead of at Meshed as hitherto. Hitherto the local head of the organization, Mr*. Carter, who visited Zahi&amp;an for the purpose during the fortnight, has only succeeded in enrolling about between 60 and 70 E.P.A.T.S* lorries and the 150 heavy trucks promised from Bushire have not material ized. Meanwhile road control and discipline along the road have greatly improved and complaints are infrequent. ( 249.

Enquiry showed that the attack was instigated by a Persian officer whom the road guard had omitted to salute, and that Persian soldiers were present even if they did not take part in the assault themselves. All of them, Sikhs and soldiers? are alleged to have been drunk. An enquiry into the case is being held by the Governor. 250. A U.K.C.C. lorry was stopped by some road guards at the post of Kal-i~Shcr and asked to give a lift to one of them and his family. When the driver refused on the ground that he was forbidden to take passengers he was assaulted, pulled out of his lorry and shut up for a time in the road guard post. This is anew developemerit of the passenger difficulty. The local authorities have been requested to take disciplinary action against the road guards concerned. Smugg 1 ing to Afgh ani 3 1 an. 251.

The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation formally took over charge of the transport of supplies to Russia on July 8th. Owing however to the non-arrival of a number of the lorries which they had hoped to use on this route, the U.K.C.C. were unable to assume complete responsibility from their own re sources for the transport of the supplies, and an arrangement has been reached between the two organizations by which the U.K.C.C. will employ those of the East Persian Auxiliary Transport Service contractors who are willing to enter into fresh contracts with them. Meanwhile,in order to maintain the flow of supplies, E.F.A.f.S. lorries are continuing to carry loads to Meshed pending a decision as to their future. His Majesty*s Consul-General is acting in close cooperation with the U.K.C.C. representative Mr. Carter in all these matters and also in the establishment of a proper road control system. 236. lieutenant-Colonel Herbert, Officer-in-Charge of the S.P.A.T.S., and uieutenant-Colonel Perry, R.I.A.S.C., of North West Army Staff paid visits to Meshed during the fort night under report on their way to and from Tehran to dis cuss the transfer of control of the supply route to the U.K.C.C.

In consequence of the increased insecurity on the Meshed- Turbat-i-Haidari section of the Zahidan road, His Majesty’s Consul-General jaddressed a strong letter to the Governor- General requesting him to take immediate steps to protect travellers and restore security, pointing out that the position on this section compared unfavourably with that on the Bir v ‘and and Zahidan sections. In reply the Ustandar stated that orders had already been issued to increase the number of the road guards and protect the road by mounted patrols, and that the . officer in charlge of the section where the recent incidents had occurred was being court—marshalled for neglect of duty. It is hoped that these measures will lead to an improvement in security on this part of the road. rHiOKACAM. Local Affairs. 238.

The prices of ghee, rice, and firewood have risen during the past fortnight, and in spite of the advent of the harvest the price of bread has not yet fallen below Hials 8 even at the Government shops where the quality is indifferent.

Mr. Poliak, British ralestinlhe subject, has sold the considerable stocks of tea which he held to the nocal Govern ment to assist them in bringing their tea rationing scheme into force. 244. Agha Safa, head of the ”Idareh-i-Pisha wa Hunar”, the department which is in charge of the local sugar factory, has asked His Majesty’s Consul-General for help in trans porting coal for the use of the factory. v'ork is due to begin in the last week in September and with existing trans port the Department will be unable to procure more than a thousand tons of coal. Sven if as is likely the factory does not work to its full capacity Cowing again to the difficulty of transporting the beet crop from a distance,) 2000 more tons of coal at least will be required. Animal transport is already fully employed in bringing in wheat and other commodities. His Majesty’s Consul-General promised to consult the U.K.C.C., but gave hgha Safa little hope that they would be able to help the factory to any great extent. He pointed out that with a little forethought the transport of the coal to the factory could have been begun 8 or 9 months ago, when rates for both animal and lorry transport were a fraction of what they are now. Propaganda. 245. The cinema van which has recently been supplied for propaganda work in the Khorasan, Meier an, and ^abul areas left Meshed on tour in the direction of Zahidan on July 17th. It was provided with one spare tyre only which is already in use owing to a burst between Meshed and Turbat—i—Haidari. it is hoped that other spare tyres will be immediately avail able, otherwise the van will not get very far. The average life of a lorry-tyre is 2000 miles on the Zahidan road owing to the thick layer of large sharp-edged chunks of road-metal with which the entire surface is covered. Foreign Subjects. 246.

Useful information was obtained from officials and locals on the following subject- among o oners; — the security situationknd Amnieh dispositions along the Herat Border; routes and methods used By Afghan raiders; wheat and opium cultivation; irrigation works at Bariman and Salami and the coal mines at Ohashma Gul north of TurB&amp;t- i-Shaikh Jam, all of which were visited; camel statistics; and the tribal situation resulting flom the _ mis government of the last years of Eeza Shah Pahlavi’s reign. Gr-lL-t . Securityc 144. The above tour happened to coincide with a recrudescence of raiding By trans-border Sultanzai outlaws in the area visited, two serious clashes with lo.ss of life having taken place within the preceding six days. His Majesty's Consul-General was obliged to take an Amnieh escort from Ta^at to Bui Khaf over the Karat pass, the reputation of which is so bad that it is known locally as the Gudar-i- Khuni. No raiders were seen and the chief difficulty was with the 'road' which was found to be barely passable even by high-clearance American cars. So far as is known, this is the first time that the section of frontier in question has been reconnoitred by car. 145. The Amnieh were found to be well equipped and clad, and in sufficient numbers, but too much concentrated in tne towns. In the Port at Taiabat (Karez), for instance, there were at least 40 men whereas only three were found in the post :n the Gudar-i-Khuni out of a paper strength of 9. Such posts are mere funk-holes in which the Amnieh shut themselves up when raiders are about. 146. On the night of 22nd Hay a gang of robbers armed w ith muskets held up several lorries near Sangbast 24 milesjsouth- east of Meshed on the Zahidan road, as usual, considerable sums of money made from smuggling were taken off the drivers and the loads on the lorries were left alone. Messrs. Weisser (Czech) and Malakoff (Eussian) of Kampsax who were on their way to Turbat-i-Haidari were robbed of the money they had on them, 170 tomans. They report that there were 12 robbers and that they were Afghans. The Persian authorities allege that the robbers were coolies working for Skoda *s on the road, but it is highly probable that the robbery was commited by one of the Sultanzai gangs mentioned in paragraph above. TTheat . 147. Eeference Political Diary No. 8 , dated the 28th April 1942, paragraph 120. Ano’ther 1,300 tons of wheat have arrived at z a hi$an by the new goods train service completing the 3,000 tons oraered by the Persian Government. The price of wheat has fallen at Meshed to 80 tomans per kharwar and of bread from 10 uo 8 rials per batman, further timely showers have ensured a bumper crop in most though not all districts.2 lH 1 O' Oo mmn i c a tiorxs. 148, The arrangements made by His ilajesty*s Legation Tvith the 1 ,Ministry of finance fbr the supply of wheat to the roah companies are wooing satisfactorily and in consequence the number of men employed on the central and southern sections of the Zahidan-Meshed road has greatly increased. Owing to the great heat, however, operations are carried on under difficult conditions and there is likely to be much further delay in the completion of the work, which was scheduled to be finished by the end of April. 149. The chief bottleneck in East Persia, as elsewhere, is the shortage of transport vehicles, which again is closely connected with the tyre famine. The unprecedentedly high price of practically all commodities, which suits profiteers official and non-official but is the main cause of the pre vailing discontent and Allied unpopularity, is due to this fac'atr as much as to any other. High prices mean high profits to traders and fierce competition for transport, for which exorbitant rates are paid; this again inflates prices, and so on in a vicious spiral. In these circumstances it is regrettable, to say the least, that the Persian Government should continue to import via Zahidan large quantities of cement for the construction o f railway stations on the (as yet non-existant) Shahrud-Meshed railway extension. This has been going on since last autumn and there are still thousands of tons of cement lying at Mok Kundi and Zahidan. recently the Zahidan authorities 'cornered* all privately- owned lorries for the carriage of cement to Nishapur, paying record rates per kharwar and refusing licences to lorries for the carriage of sugar and other trade goods. Consul ar representations have had some effect and the position is now easier. Cement has been used before for the blocking of jlines of communication. Kussian Affairs. Military . 150. The garrison of Meshed has been increased by the arrival on 22nd May 1942 of 1,200 infantry from Askhabad. 151. The Soviet Trade Agency is buying horses all over Khorasan, both direct and through a local firm called Isaoff. His Majesty's Consul-General learned at Salami (Bui Khaf district) that a partjj of Russians had visited the olace a few days before and bought 21 horses. On return to Meshed he suggested to the Soviet Consul-General the purchase of surplus Army horses in India. The idea was well received and a’ lormal request has now been received for the assistance of the Government of India in the purchase of 5,000 horses, eithe military or civil, for the use of the Red Army 0 _ The Soviet authorities have also responded/iith enunusiasm to the suggestion that the sugar requirements Tran sc asp la, where there is a famine of that commodity, ]i e . supplied from India. A request for 8,000 tons by the /^aaiaan route has been received and is being dealt with. of should reported at the time, the Persian garrison of Meshed in their headlong flight fromthe Russian occupying lorces last August threw away equipm'ent of all kinds includ- rifles and machine-guns. Some of these were recovered ^ 13116 Russian military authorities and they have ^enon ^he look-outfor arifB ever since. On 21st May a detachment o± their infantry surrounded Amnieh Headnuarters at Meshed and searched the premises. They found six light- . A i I machine-guns i/jhich hacL i)een hidden 'by the ^ c . :a them to the Bnssian camp. It is curious that t, t &gt;6Sv. \ had not long 'before 'been restored to the military aa tieso In this connection it may t&gt;e mentioned 't^at Rais-i-r ^mnieh Sarhang Saltash, an energetic and capaole onicer, is reported to he strongly pro-A^is. The Soviet Oonsui- General mentionecl to His Majesty's Consul-General a few days ago that he had information of the presence in Ifesnoi of an Iraoi agitator, son of one Shaikh lUsa of nejef, who Yjas reported to he spreading stories of hidden s teems of arms throughout the Middle East awaiting the arrival oi Axis forceso The commencement of the long-awaited G-erman offensive in the Ukraine is evidently making the local Russians jumpy,.

That on the Gentrai (Birjand) section has been greatly hampered ana delayed by the difficulties experienced by messrs. Jaffar Jaffary in feeding tneir workmen. The contractors do not expect to finish the work until the end of June, and tnat only if the efforts now being made to ensure steady and adequate supplies of bread to the men are successful. The case is somewhat different vdth Messrs. Shirket-i-iiizhaeh on the z&amp;hidan section, who have a special clause in their contract entitling them to claim from the British Government whatever they have to pay for their wheat above Bials 700 per kharwar. This clause removes any incenti'v to economise and there is reason to believe that the Company have kept up their labour supply by buying wheat Ibr the men*s rations at Bials 1,400 per kharwar from official/of the same Persian department that is paying the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation less than 600 Bials for it at hok Kundi t Bail way. 122* Beoonstruetion of the h 0 k Kunai-zaliidan extension was completed during trie fortnight and an Inspection Train carrying the Government Inspector of Bailways and the General Manager of tuie North-western Bailway visited zahidan on the 20th April.

The situation improved during the fortnight with the arrival at Zahidan of three consignments of wheat from India totalling 378 tons. Owing to a misunderstanding all this wheat was secured by the Zahidan “Economic Department 1 * (formerly Maliya) instead of 50 &gt; of it going to the various road con tractors under Kampsax, 20&gt; to Dirjand, and 5&gt; to meshed as was intended. The Zahidan authorities have however been induced to disgorge about 20 tons for the road workers, and arrangements have been made to keep the distribution of all further consign ments in our hands, it is hoped that some 3,000 tons in all will be imported via Nok Kundi during the spring and early summer. This, if fairly distributed, should suffice for the needs of Zahidan and Mekran, of nirjand and the qainat, and of the 16,000 or so labourers working on the Zahidan-Birj and and Zahidan-Bam roads. Meanwhile local stocks of wheat are becoming available in Khorasan (though at very high prices) thanks to the energetic policy of the new Governor-General, and future short ages at Meshed are not likely to be more than temporary. IRANIAN OFFICIALS. 26. Agha Ali Mansur arrived from xehran on the 29th January and took over charge as Ustandar (Governor-General) of Khorasan and Mitawalli Bashi of the Shrine, ne seems to be a man of character and ability, under no illusions as to the capacity of Iran to carry on without the help and protection of Britain and Russia, and sincerely determined to govern the Province fairly, nis speech to the notables of Meshed two days after taking over was unexceptionable, and his policy towards the defeated ad herents of Saulat-us-Saltana is statesmanlike, ne is also taking the wheat situation in hand and there is now no lack of bread or other necessaries in Meshed, complaints of high and rising prices are however widespread; whether thisTdue to in flation pure and simple or to other causes such as hoarding, profiteering, and official corruption it is at present hard to say. 27. On the 12th February the Governor-General and the Farman » -dar gave a reception in honour of the Treaty to about 150 guests representative of all communities. The function went off well enough, but it was noticeable that none of the Persian military officers present in Meshed came to it, though colonel Luchinsky and other Russian officers were invited. There was also a rather obvious attempt at segregating the Persian officials from the foreign guests by means of a long table down the centre of the room. PERSIAN MILITARY. 28. Sartip mhammad Khan Nakhjawan arrived in Meshed from Tehran on the 8th February and took over command of the troops. As Commandant of the Persian forces in the campaign against the Sarhad tribes in 1928-29 this officer showed considerable military skill, while he and Amir-i-Lashkar Amanullah nirza Jahanbani were consistently helpful and friendly to myself and other British officers in the area.2 (g&amp; % 29.

Hevolt of SauLat-us-Saltana » jhe following is in amplification of the telegraphic reports already submitted. 33. jg stated in paragraph 21 of last Diary, Saulat- us-Saltana issued a printed proclamation to the people of meshed on the 20th January. In it he urged the people . to get rid of the gang of corrupt politicians and officials who had inherited and were perpetuating the cruel regime of Beza Shah. Bailing, however, to obtain popular support in the town he left Meshed and established himself and his forces at Bariman, 48 miles along the Herat road, with a strong outpost at the fort of Sangbast which commands the Tehran-meshed-Zaki&amp;a 11 road-fork at mile 24. 34o The new Governor-General *s first act on arrival at meshed was to send two prominent citizens to Bariman as emissaries to persuade Saulat to settle his dispute witt the Government by negotiation. The appeal was ignored. On the 2nd Bebuuary 1,200 Government troops with two tanks two armoured cars and some artillery under the command o.* Sarhang beglari arrived in meshed after an inconclusive brush with Saulat*s men at Sangbast en route * On the 4th the Government force less about 200 men moved out and attacked Sangbast, took it with the help of trench mortarsj and pursued Saulat*s men south-eastwards* During the next few days the rebels were driven out of Bariman and xurbat- i-Sheikh Jam in turn and finally they dispersed. The rebel leader took refuge among the mountains °y Nadir! after an unsuccessful attempt to enter Afghan terri tory. 35 . meanwhile his brother MUntasar-ul-Milk had been encamped with about 300 rifles outside Turbat-i-naiaarl, closing the Meshed-Zfchidan road which was deserted by its imnieh guards at the first alarm of the rebels, only the firm attitude and at clever bluff of the Governor-designate of the district, Sartip muhammad Karim Khan izzatpanan, saved the town from being occupied and perhaps looted, it was not till muntasar heard that his brother had been defeated that he forced his way into the town, took loo tfifles off the Amnieh and police, and looted some Govern ment carpets and other property, it is noteworthy, how ever, that very little looting of private property was done by either party of rebels. An Indian did lose a consignment of bicycle tyres pound for xehran, but he made the mistake of sending it by the mail lorry. On the other hand, Saulat’s men before evacuating Bariman gutted the place thoroughly, removing all the carpets, furniture, and window-glass from the guest house and other Govern^ ment buildings and emptying the state-owned cloth shop.3 Some of this loot isas reoovered/from nearby villages ty the troops* I 36* The Govemor-oeneral Agka Ali Mansur went to Nari man as soon as it was cleared of relels, put a (Jonnnlssion to work assessing and reporting on the damage, and proclaim ed an amnesty.

FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. SEEN OUTICAL. OOMMlTTBe. This diar^/ - is for the month of October. The injured pride of the Persians and the persistent if forlorn hope of German intervention caused pro-merman sentiment to he more in evidence. The arrival of the Commandant and a party of Aranieh in Meshed on October 19th, bringing with them 30 rifles for the Police and 30 for the Amnieh, led to some improvement in the security situation, though thefts and hold-ups still continued. A number of weapons, especially machine guns, were being smuggled across the Afghan border. Sugar was once again scarce but rice was plentiful. There was no lack of petrol though kerosene was still short. The cost of petrol and kerosene rose to 32 and 27 rials respectively per 4 -gallon tin. The latest telegram received from Meshed stated that wheat, kerosene, and sugar were more plentiful. In Bir jand the situation was still uncertain and the shortage of bread continued. I The public refused to pay income tax and a branch of the Tax Department was robbed. In consequence of some 15 desertions a strict watch was kept on conscripts in this area. It is the opinion of the tribes of South Mukran that the British and not the Persian/V Persian Government is in control there. The bank at ZahidaS- received 100,000 rials to pay the troops but was ordered to return the money to Tehran. Some lorries were held up by the Police at MirjawB-Customs Post but the Vice-Consul ini ormo the Governor that the 'V” flag which they were flying had no objectionable significance and they were allowed to pass. The Governor General at Meshed was growing increasingly unpopular. The Chief of Police and the Faraandar of Meshed left for Tehran and will not return 'if they can possibly he P 1 ' • The reception of Delhi broadcasts was good and the talks of Major Abdus Samad Shall very popular, but the announcer at 8 p.m. ..was considered to have an exaggeratec pronunciation.

The Meshed Police are taking action against the f^ara^e Hussaini for allowing a commercial lorry to contravene regulations by taking ten passengers as well as its load » | 63 V ^ . 1316 situation in Birjand continues 1• The lack of bread resulted in a crowd ' threatening the Heis-i-Tasvieh at his house on October until they were pacified by the Governor and the Chief p~ Police. The public now openly refuse to pay income tax, and a branch of the income tax Department -near the Afghan border has been robbed* On October l~th, 13th and 14th a religious procession was taken out. This procession was prohibited by the former Government and the police, after futile efforts to interfere, eventually left it alone. A speech by a Municipal employee was delivered condemning the former Go ve rumen t • 64. Mirsa Ali Akbar Assadi, son-in-law of the present Prime Minister left for Tehran on October 15th. 66# Conscripts, in consequence of some 15 desertions, are now strictly watched at night in Birjand. SISTAN. 66. An interesting comment on the change of regime is provided by the recovery of land by Sardar Khan Malik, an influential landowner of Sistan. Hiring the previous regime the Government took away this Sardar•s land (with that of other landowners) and divided it among his tenants and for some time he had attempted unsuccessfully to regain it# MUICBAN 67. Khan Sahib Idu Khan, Beki tribe, is expected shortly at Khwash. H.M*s Vice Consul, who received a call from Sardar Kehrullah Khan Beki, was informed that the return of Khan Sahib Idu Khan may provoke a quarrel between him and Lieut: Habibullah Khan Beki, who is now serving with the Iranian Army in south Kukran • Sardar Mehrullah Khan at this interview offered 4Q0*-5GG men of his tribe for service v^ith the British Government if required. Opinion among tribesmen ip south Mukran is that the British and not the Iranian Government is in control there. Locusts have been reported at Fishin in south Mukran and the Iranian Government have taken steps to combat them. The bank at Zahid&amp;n received Rials 100,000 for disbursement to the unpaid troops, but thesmn was returned to Tehran under orders from the Central authorities* The lack of pay has obliged the Commanding Officer to obtain small quantities of foodstuffs on credit* The *V* for Victory flag flown by a number of lorries passing the Kuh-i-Malik-Siah Customs post* has produced the impression that the contents of the lorries were consignments despatched by the British Government to Meshed and resulted in exemption for those lorries from Customs examination* At Mirjawa the police interfered with two lorries carrying this flag but the Governor was infbrmed oy H*M f s Vice Consul that these flags had no objectionable significance and subsequently he gave orders that they were not to be interfered with* IBABIiN MILITARY AFFAIBS. £8* . . On October 19th the wives of the Xraniar military officers whom the Bussians deported to Russia received two months pay on behalf of their husbands from the Revenue Department* IRAKI AIT ORRICIALR, • On October 20th an anonynous letter was received which purported to be a reply to the Russian newspaper 'Afkhar-i-Khalq' (circulated by the Russians in Meshed) and to the broadcasts in Persian from London and Delhi. The letter was chiefly _k° w ® ver ag&amp;inst M.Pakrevan, Governor G-ensral oi Meshed* whom it pilloried as 'Kapakrevan* in detailing enormities practised on the people and irregularities in the Shrine accounts. The letter is some reflection of the growing unpopularity of the Governor General in Meshed* whom, now that he no longer has the protection of the ex-Shah his enemies f are resolved to remove* Z 0 » ^ Sarhang Viqar, Chief of Police lor Khorasan left Meshed for Tehran on October 15th followed by Agha Mohamed Rukni, Farmandar of Meshed on the 18th* Neither will return If they can possibly help it* Sarhang Khaderi , Commandant of the Ajanieh, arrived with a party of Amnieh in Meshed from Tehran on October 12th. This is a welcome sign that the authority of armed guards may soon be re-established on the roads in Khorasan.

The party (Paragraph 47) who proceeded southwards from Meshed and were’ presumed to have for their object reconnaissance of ifem the Meshed-Zahidan and Zahidan-Zabul routes, after brief visits to Zahidan and Zabul reappeared in Birjand on October 6th and left for Meshed the same day* This seems to have been the end of their activities* BRO ADC AS TDT G * 74.

No success has so far attended efforts to obtain arms for the rearmament of the police or gendarmarie though I am reporting separately on this matter* and nothing can therefore he done about the banditry which is now spreading to the roads. Several hold ups of passenger buses have been reported* one on September 30th at sunset only 10 miles south of Meshed* Another bus was held up twice on the way from Tehran to Meshed early in Onto her. An Indian bus driver also was fired at by men in Iranian military uniform about 50 miles south of Meshed on the road to 5 Zahidan but escaped by putting on speed. It is* however, reported that the Russians are now assisting in rounding up brigands in cases where reports are given to them in time but this is not part of their official policy. Meshed itself was alarmed by the murder one night of 3 people by smugglers who are said to have had a feud with one of their victims who had been a customs officer on the Sarakhs border. Fortunately the merderers have been arrested. Estate owners are afraid to go to their villages to arrange for autumn sowings and others are gradually leaving Meshed for areas outside Russian control. 38. The supply situation is somewhat improved; the chief shortage now is kerosine oil, for which queues daily besiege the A.I.O.C. office. No rice or sugar is available but the sugar factory is now working ana supplies are promised in a weeks time* iTTheat stocks in the town are sufficient for 20 days but local insecurity makes further collections increasingly difficult* 39. The behaviour of the Russian troops In Meshed continues to be exemplary but people are still afraid of them and put down their moderation largely to the restraining influence of the British. The distribution of their propaganda news-sheet Afkar-i- Khalq continues* but so far seems to have had little effect except to heighten the mistrust of Soviet intentions felt by the better classes. These news- sheets are eagerly sought after by street loafers and children but only because they make a little money by selling them to others. 40. A petition has been addressed to this Consulate General by fortytwo wives of Iranian military officers lately deported to Russia, begging for our intervention on behalf of their husbands. birjand. 41.

Cars and lorries belonging to the Consulate at Meshed and two British Indians there, which were commandeered by the army, had all been accounted for by the end of September. There was, however, a great s carcity of Transport in Mhorasan owing chiefly to the lack of petrol and oils ; which lectin turn ( to a shortage of food m noshed. The latest telegraphed report from there, dated 1 st l\iovember, shows that this state of affairs continues.

BIEJAlTD * 26* Mr L*H.Y*French, H*M # s Vice Consul Zabul paid a visit to Zabul from August 23th to 2nd September when he returned to Birjand. His arrival did much to relieve the fear of a Bussian advance from Turbat-i-Haidari, and the people were eventually persuaded by the Farmandar to return from the hills wherewith a large number of officers and men of the loca] garrison, they had taken refuge* 27* As was onlj to be expected there has been a recrudescence of thefts in the neighbourhood,two of our servants in the Consulate kalate being among the victims* The food shortage is still acute and sugar is ^reported to be quite unobtainable* KHOBASAIT. 28* The situation in Meshed, about which I have reported separately, remains much the same as before* ¥heat and petrol supplies are slightly better and the great anxiety which was being felt over the lubricating oil position's temporarily relieved by the arrival on September 28th of a consignment of 1000 gallons* Normal supplies of petrol have now been promised from Semnan starting from October 1st but the shortage of transport is acute* This is caused partly from the fact that no tyres are procurable and partly by Iranian fears that the ^Russians will commandeer their lorries for their own use* As a result there is no means of bringing in the sugar beet crop from the countryside to the factory and no coal to work the factory when the beet arrives* Indian owned transport is much in dsa&amp;nd* There are reports that the Russians propose to employ 200 hired lorries on the road to Bajgiran but this is not as yet confirmed* 29* The military occupation does not appear to extend further than some 5 miles south of Meshed and this was the point to which the Russian3* staff officer escorted our British officers (para: 20) when the^ left Meshed* This staff officer when asked if he proposed to learn Persian replied significantly that he would ao so “if they were to stay here** On the Herat road the Russians appear to have nothing beyond a small post at Turhat-i-Bhelk-Jam* Lieut-Colonel Taj Bakhsh, the Commander of the Amnieh (Gendarme±ie) Regiment responsible for the frontier from Kariz (on the Herat road) northwards to Sarakhs called on me last week and told me that his 2 northern companies which occupied posts opposite the Russian frontier had been disarmed and disbanded* but that the 3rd Company opposite Afghanistan had been ordered to carry on as usual* This Is curious as elsewhere the Russians seem to have endeavoured to disarm the whole countryside down to and including RLrjand*. The police at Birjand who are under the jurisdiction of the Chief of Police in Meshed have been compelled to hand over their arms; but the army and Amnieh not beiog under civil control the Governor General expressed his inability to do anything to effect their disarmament, and accordingly the garrison of Birjand and such of the Amnieh south of Turhat~I~Haidari as have not deserted retain their arms as before* IRAKI:iff MILITARY AFFAIRS* 30* Detachments of the 15th 2abull Regiment at Zahidan which had been sent to reinforce the frontier posts have now been withdrawn except for patrols on the 2a hi dan HUrmak road.

Ttie security situation in Khorasan stillL git^es cause for some anxiety. The panic spread hy the Iranian army on their flight extended as far as Gunahad, some 180 miles to the south up to which point the G-endarmerie are reported to have deserted en masse with their arms. The situation south of Meshed is therefore little, if any, 'better than that of the Bussian occupied areas further north. The G-overnor G-eneral is extremely pessimistic and tells me of acts of 'brigandage near 'both Gunahad and ^ahzawar on the Tehran road. Bor the moment the roads themselves seem fairly safe, though the hold up of a 'bus has 'been reported (possibly incorrectly) neai Nishapur. In Meshed itself there have 'been a number of burglaries, but here there are at least Bussian patrols in the town during the night. 14. The wheat situation has improved for the moment and supplies are coming in but the Governor General tells me that in some cases Government granaries have been looted, that there is occasional opnosition in the villages to the removal of wheat for the town and that supplies from India will be required to make good the deficiency. Meshed alone requires 50 tons of wheat a day. The petrol situation too is somewhat easier as a considerable proportion of the stocks acquired by the military before the invasion was found to have been sold privately by officers in the town before the Russians axr arrived and can now be had at a prsmium* I understand that the officers deported from Meshed numbered 110 and included some 10 of the rank of °Sj;? ne ^)v T1:le Russians on arrival in Meshed oidered all/ officers to report and these 110 fell into the trap. It is not known how many others still remain in hiding. Little sympathy was shown for them by the people of Meshed, many of whom as conscripts have sufferred terribly from their rapacity and the crowd even applauded as the lorries taking them away moved off. Some idea of the lack of system in Soviet Headquarters can be gained from the fact that two officers, the Officer Gommanding at Birjand who had been sent under orders from Tehran especially to arrange the formal handing oyer of military equipment to the Russians, and a Gendarmerie officer from TJrbat-i-Haiaari *ho bad beef expressly sent for by agreement with tbe Hussians themselves to_ reorganise the force in the Meshed area. ^ ®£?

P nave IB0Te( i I*17. Action is still iDeing taken against enemy aliens. At least three have been deported already and some ten others from i^-iman have 'been brought back to Meshed under arrest. A few remain unmolested in Meshed but these are hourly awaiting the same fate. 18. The propaganda in the town is mostly anti-German and since the announcement that the Iranian Government has accepted the allied terms there seems to have been a diminution of anti-Government propaganda. The Russians seem entirely occupied in their own affairs and, now that the police and gendarmerie have been disarmed, quite uninterested in the local administration and its problems. Nor have they time for social activities and I have entirely failed to establish any sort of relations with them.

The situation in Irag has of course 'been widely discussed and all sorts of rumours are current regarding the arrival of German and Italian help for Bashid Ali. Zahidan is afraid that Iran too will get into trouble over its oil. Meshed opinion, however, though rejoicing over any embarrassment to the British inclines to the view that it is only a local disturbance which will be settled shortly. Anxiety regarding possible Bussian reactions to German penetration into the Muslim world is less in evidence than might have been expected in view of the panic of last July. Meshed has in fact been far more disturbed by the sudden appearance of a large number of anti-Jewish posters in Persian manuscript which were found posted on walls near Jewish premises and elsewhere in the town early on May 6th, shortly after the arrival of the 24 Polish Jews mentioned in para 199 below. This has caused much alarm among the Jews here. The police speedily removed the notices but are said to be at a loss to discover their origin. CONSULAB OFFICERS 194. Lt: Colonel B.P.fhtts assumed charge of the office of B.M # s Vice Consul, Zahidan, vice Captain J.C.E. Bowen transferred on May 4th. MOKBAN 195. 1,050 tons out of 3,000 tons of wheat expected from India have so far reached Zahidan. Local officials have shown great eagerness to get the wheat into the country before anything happens to prevent its export from India! SISTAN 196. Shortly after the arrival of the new regime in Zabul (para 176) which includes a new Medical Officer, a Doctor Afshari, a mason was sent to the Consulate the area of which he said he had been ordered to measure. This was possibly a mistake for Mohammad Ali f s house, but he was referred to the Governor. A letter was also received asking for the Sub Assistant Surgeon # s licence to practice medicine to be sent for inspection. It is perhaps these activities that have led to rumours that the British Consulate in Zabul is to be closedo KHOBASAN 197. Special arrangements were made in Meshed on April 24th for electric current to be available by day to enable the people to listen to the speeches made in Tehran on the -Orientation of public opinion-. Loud speakers were installed in the Public Gardens where the Farmandar and heads of offices were assembled.X 198.

They are the first instalment of a party of 38 and have Identity Certificates issued in Lithuania and vise for Palestine hy the British Embassy in Moscow. As Ira&lt;£ does*?' allow transit to Jews they hope to 'be able to travel via India. The' local Jewish commnity has 'been instructed Ly Jewish institutions in Tehran to make all arrangements for their comfort. Apparently the Jewish Agency in Palestine is defraying the cost of their journey. They say they were hounded out of Tehran on the insistence of the German Legation there and the local authorities in Meshed are anxious to get rid of them as soon as possible 'but have stayed their hand for the moment, possibly as the result of representations made hy this Consulate General. A 200. Luring the fortnight the Cinema Firdausi has shown 3 and the Cinema Lidaban one German news reel in Persian. The Cinema Huma has had two English news reels also in Persian. MILITARY AFFAIBS B 201. A report has been sent from Chahbar to the Military at Zahidan that 13 planes, believed to be British, were seen off Chahbar on about the 20th April. As a result, the Divisional Commander has issued orders for a sharp look out to be kept for any other foreign , planes, while the local Commanding Officer has had two ancient Bussian anti-aircraft guns, for which it is ' doubtful whether there is any ammunition available, mounted on top of his office. Zahidan is apparently at last becoming Modem War Conscious! GERMAN INTEBESTS A 202. Exports from Meshed via Bajgiran for Germany during the past fortnight were J- Wool 281 tons Raisins 750 * Walnut kernels. 242 * Castor oil seed 337 ' Bikh (Soap root) ... 53 * C 203. A report has been received by the Roadguard Headquarters at Zahidan that 4 Germans have been seen in the mountains between Qaravan and Iranshahr. A Satwan (2nd Lieutenant) of the Road-guards has been sent to investigate. A Doctor and Mrs. Pese (para 181) mentioned that the Manager of Layers in Tehran was under arrest as a result of a case of ammunition being found among the medicines imported by him from Germany.

It has been interesting to note Vthat;jioi^je of^j he Zahidan officials, who like their fellows elsewhere in Iran live in the shadow of a ruthless despotism, have attributed the sudden deaths within the space of a fortnight of the Egyptian Prime Minister, Hassan Sabri,and of the War-Minister, Yunis Pasha,(both of whom are believed to have beer anti-British in sympathy) to the action of British Agents. On the same analogy they suspect that German spies poisoned.Lord Lothian because he was proving too influential an advocate of American aid for Britain I Local officials have noted with relief that 7 .Molotov since his return to Moscow, frojn BerliiU JT-^s^^ikefeBrei^^g^bbit, “laid low and _ said nuf f in” • They conslcftf nlliat; ni^le^^Tias suffered a major diplomat if defeat. They have' been interested to learn from the Moscow radio! that M. Molotov, on his return informed the Japanese Ambassador that Russia would continue to help the Nationalist Government in China, and that the Soviet Government has not only.declared itself unable to send furth er supplies of oil to Germany, but^also insisting that the Rumanian oil wells should continue to supply oil to new Russian province of Basgarabia. Iranians in Zahidan are surprised that Germany has done noth ing to help Italy out of her difficulties in Greece and Albania.They attribute the inaction of the Nazis to the fact that Germany neither wishes to offend Russia nor by precipitate action at the present moment to bring Turkey into the conflict. They consider, moreover, that the spirited show put up by the Greeks will ensure the lurks standing up to Germany, and they believe that they have no longer reason to fear the danger of a German army marching unopposed into Iran through Turkey/ The educatied Iranians continue to pay a great deal of atten tion to the extracts from Mr. Churchill *s speeches publisned in the Persian newspapers. It is satisfactory to be able to record that they not only read but apparently also believe what Mr.Churchill says.they recognise him as a great fighter, and have been impressed by the fact that he has never exaggerated the favourable factors in any situation, even when things have looked very black for Britain. Now that Mr. Chur chill has declared that the British Empire is preparing for a great offensive against Germany they believe him to be speaking the truth, and are inclined to think that the tide has turned in Britain*.s favour. There is,however, little hope of really wj’m feelings of friednship or admiration for Britain until the all victorious German army has h^en whacked. BROADCASTING. Nil. MUKRAN. . ... .. 4. • 4--, 395. The issue of cornjSugar^ and rice is being very strictly con trolled. in Zahidan. This is attributed by some.to the fact that^the Iranian Government is exporting these commodities to Russia, or Germany, but a more probable reason is that the Iranian Government is taking precautions'against any scarcity which might be caused by a long war. 396. SISTAN. An epidemic of Interic fever is reported to h*ve broken out in Zabul.. 397 ^ There is a great shortage of wheat in Zabul at present,and it is reported, that the Wheat Control Department, Zabul, which was asked to supnlv 6,000 Tabrizi Kharwars (3,900,000 lbs) of wheat to the Mily: at Zahidan and Khwash has been unabig f,o do so. Fhe shortage has led to a rise in the price of wheat from Rials 180 to 240 per Tabrizi Khar- war. The authorities are now endeavouring to collect wheat from the Sistan landlords by force. 398. The Roads Department have undertaken the re§^r of the wooden bridge over the Naurab, a few miles outside Zabul. Inis means that, for the next two months at least there will be no direct communication byroad between Zahidan and Zabul. The local authorities have,however, promised to provide for the transhipment of goods and people. BIRJAND . Nil. KHORASaN. 399. The Revenue department has notified the land-lords and agriculturists of the Kalat, Sarakhs and Zorabad areas that the orders prohibiting the sowing of poppy in those areas have been cancelled, and that opium collected from the crop may be sold to the Government as before. 400.

Sartip Maiman, Divisional Commander,8th Mukran Division, Khwash, accompanied by a party of Military Officers,reached Zahidan on the 22nd November. They visited various points near the Indolranian frontier, including Lar Jungle(15 miles North-East of Zahidan), and Lar Road-guard post on the Zahidan-Mirjawa road. The Divisional Comman* der and the party left for Zabul on the 24th November. The party also intended to visit the Afghan frontier in the vicinity of Deh-Dost Mohammed and Kuhak.One of the members of the party is believed to have prospected a site for an aeroplane hanger close to the existing landing ground at Zahidan. A similar site is said to have been chosen near the landing ground at Khwash. 403. A cover marked Confidential is reported to have been handed over to all Commissioned Officers in Zahidan, which is said to have contained a personal message from the Heir Apparent, as supreme Commanf der of the Army, and. in which he stated that Iran was facing a grave moment in her history, and. that many hardships would probably have to be borne in the near future; that they (the officers) 'ought not to be deaf to the drum which was being beaten on the roof their house'. The message ended with a statement that both the Heir Apparent and his father the Shah, were confident that all officers would, if occa sion arose, sacrifice their lives for the honour o^ their motherland. The officers are inclined to believe that the drum 'beating on the roof their house' refers to the Italian bombardment of Bahrein. 404. 5 lorry loads of clothing, equipment and medicines for the 8th Mukran Division, Khwash, passed through Zahidan during November.

C OMMUNIC ATIONS. 43 _]_. As the railway uses most of its rolling stock for portation of material for the construction of the railway the and trans ha s very few spare wagons for carrying merchandise, the restrictions imposed some months back on the transportation of merchandise by motor lorries between Semnan and Tehran, and Qum and Tehran, have been withdrawn. Lorries can now carry loads over the whole distance between meshed and Tehran. 412. Since the recent visit to Zahidan and Mirjaweh of the European railwav engineers the Zahidan public has become quite convinced that Zahidan will in the not-so-distant future be linked by rail with Quetta and Tehran. It is generally thought that the British and Iranian Govern) ments have concluded an agreement, under which not only the railway line in British territory from Nok-Kundi to Mirjaweh will be put in running o^der, but also the cost of constructing the line from Zahidan the British Government. This idea seems linked a belief that some sort of guarantee has been the Iranian Government to the effect that the^ in the event of Russian aggression against to Qum will be borne by in the public mind with given by the British to will furnish armed help Iran. Local officials believe that the T : r ork of reconditioning the Fok-Kundi-^irjaweh-Zahidan sector will be commenced in January 1941, and completed''by Fauroz(March 21st) 1941,so that material for the con struction of the Zahidan-Kirman sector can be brought up by rail to Zahidan. It is reported that construction of the new line from Zahidan be started at the same time at Qum,(or at 40,000 coolies are being.engaged for the to Firman. Work is also to whatever point the railway from Tehran has at present reached), with the idea of linking the two lines at ANARAK. . Mr. Hacklin. the chief engineer, is expected to visit Zahiaan again in the near future and to bring with him from Tehran a number of railway construction overseers. ST JIGGLING. 413.

The news broadcast in Persian from Germany, that Messrs Molotov and Hitler proposed at their recent meeting in Berlin to settle in one week the differences of half the world,greatly disturb ed some of the Iranian traders in Zahidan, who, in the expectation of a Russian attack on India through Zahidan, proceeded to lay in extra stocks of sugar, corn and rice. The fact that, since M.Molotov* s return to Russia, the Soviet Government has not shown any signs of outward activity, has somewhat re-assured these local pessimists, who now think that there is a chance that Russia may not after al^ throw in her lot with Germany and Italy. Events in the Balkans are being closely watched by Iranian officials in Zahidan, who think the Germans intend to let the Ital ians suffer some reverses in order to teach them that they have no power of themselves to help themselves l They think that, when this lesson has been taught, the German High Command will send Italy such powerful help as will turn the tables on the Greeks. The average educated Iranian continues to believe as strongly as ever in the invincibility of the German army, and it is thought locally that Turkey will be foolish to try and make a stand against the Germans if they decide to continue their advance towards the East. In Zahidan the Mahzar-i-Shara*(the Mujtahid in charge of ^the Iranian mosque) has attributed all the disasters, including the ea£h- quake and the mass executions, which have befalletfl Rumania, to divine displeasure at that country*s unfaithfulness to her treaty obligations to Britain. s Local officials in -i-Zahidan hope and believe that a trade agreement will shortly be signed between Britain and Russia.They think that if such an agreement is concluded, the rapprochment of which it will be outward sign, will be largely the result of efforts by the Turkish Government. BROADCASTING. 380. The German broadcast of the news in Persian has been inaudi ble in Zahidan on several nights during the past fortnight, but the reception of the Delhi programmes continues to be good. GERMAN INTERESTS. 381. Herr Herbert Dittman, German charge d*Affaires at Tehran, accompanied by his wife Gretta Dittman arrived in Meshed on the 7th November and returned to Tehran on the 10th November. They stayed wilt Herr Semper, and Herr Dittman called on the Governor General. A short paragraph in the local newspaper 'Azadi 11 stated that Herr Dittman was visitin 0, Meshed in order to see places of interest in and around the city! 382. Major Von Geldern Grespaorf, German Military and Air Attache at Tehran, arrived in Meshed on November 14th,visited the Governor General, and returned to Tehran on the 15th. He stayed with Herr Semper and was only in Meshed for about 40 hours. 383. Buroslav Stekley, a Czech who is working as the German Forwarding Agent at Bajgiran on the Russian frontier arrived in Meshed from Bajgiran on the 13th November. He is reported to have stated that the Russian Government have refused to accept any more goods from Iran in transit for Germany as the skins, wool, and cotton already despatched have been found to contain anthrax and foot-and- mouth-disease germs.Goods are,however, still being despatched to the frontier. It is significant that Steklery's arrival in Meshed coin cided with the visit of the Germaft Military Attache 1 ,with whom he is(2) said to have had 3-ong conversations. 384. Herr Semper is now actively engaged in pro-HNazi propaganda in Meshed. Anti-British books in English are being distributed by him, and a copy of a book called ’‘British tyranny in India” by Reinhard Frank in the “Britain Unmasked series” has fallen into the hands of the Consulate General. 385. German propaganda films are also appearing in all the Meshed Cinemas-the latest, showing the German victories in France, Flanders etc: and the fall of Paris, has been shown nightly to crowded houses of Iranians as a further example of German invin cibility.These films are not the usual news-reels type but propa ganda films lasting about half an hour. British news-reels are now seldom seen in the local cinemas and when they are shown are generally very out of date. 386. A Czech, Dobe by name, accompanied by his German wife, arrived at Meshed from Kabul on the 8th November and left for Tehran on the 12th. He is an employee of the Skoda firm and is said to have visited Kabul to instal machinery, for the sugar factory there. 387. Reference para 367.

Mr. A.Lynch, 3rd Secretary of the American Legation, Tehran accompanied by his British wife, and Mr. Nyman, United States citizen, photographer to the Iranian Institute, New York, reached Meshed on the 11th and left for Zahidan on the 14th November. This party,accompanied by Mr and Mrs Simon, he an Ameri can, she an Armenian by birth, reached Zahidan by motor caravan on the 18th and left for Nok-Kundi on the 19th November. 389. Doctor Cochran, of the American Mission Hospital, Meshed, reached Zahidan on the 21st November 1940 to attend Mrs.Bowen who was suddenly taken ill on the 19th November. Doctor Cochran left again for Meshed on the 22nd November. 390. Reference para 368. The Zahidan Police have received orders to send their prisoner Komitoff (alias Nikola) back to Meshed, in order that he may be put back over the frontier into Russian territory. THE ZAHIDAN-MIR JAV/EH RAILWAY. 391. Mr. Hacklin, a Swedish Engineer in charge of the construe tion of the proposed railway line between Tehran and Zahidan via Kirman, accompanied by Greek and Esthonian Assistant Engineers reached Zahidan via Kirman on the 13th November. During their stay in Sahidan they motored along the railway line to Kirjaweh and prospected the line as far as the point where it enters British territory near Qila Safid. Mr. Hacklin stated that in view of the difficulty at present of obtaining iron rails abroad the intention is to put the disused line between Zahidan and Mirjaweh into good repair, and then, as soon as more rails are received, to complete the portion between Zahidan and Qum to which point the railway from Tehran via Kirman has so far reached. Mr. Hacklin also prospected a site for the proposed new railway station at Mirjaweh,at which the change-over of goods and passengers from standard European guage to Indian broad guage- when eventually the railway at this point links Europe and Asia- will in future' be effected. He v/as anxious to know whether I then thought it likely that the GovernmentJlndia will be prepared to re-open the Nok-Kundi Mirjaweh line as soon as the Zahidan Kirjawe} section is again in working order. During their stay in Zahidan Mr.Hacklin and the GreekEngineer, Mr.Schaconas, visited the port of Chahbar.There is appa rently no idea at present of constructing a railway line to the port hut they consulted Military officers stationed in the area and seemed to think that the best route for a Railway line would be Chahbar-Sarbaz-Iranshahr-Bampur-Regan,joining up with the main Kirman-Zahidan line at Bam. The engineers were also able to furnish some interesting information about the Zahidan-Chahbar road, about which, since it traverses the M closed M military area of Khwash, very little is known, They described the road as being only motorable in the non-rainy months of May-December and as passing through thick sand at CHAHDAZ, 68 miles south of Iranshahr (Bampur), and water at frequent interval* when it follows the course of a river through a gorge for 24 kilo metres at Tang-i-Sahra, 55 kilometres north of Nek-Shahr (Geh). MOVEMENTS OF BRITISH SUBJECTS. 392. Mr. Reeves, British subject, an Adviser to the Siamese Customs arrived at Meshed from Afghanistan on the 10th and left for Tehran on the 11th. His visit to Tehran is believed to be connected with opium. 393. An Indian named Mahmud Hassan, has recently been found and arrested by the Iranian Military authorities in the vicinity of Khwash. As' he has apparently served in the Indian Army he is sus pected of being a British spy. He is at present in the custody of Zahidan Police. Acting Consul No: 3-2/9 British Vice Consulate, Zahidan.

KHORASAN POLITICAL POLITICAL. ^ ^Vifte Consulate, Zahidan. Dated^-^hp q l^&gt;th November 1940 2(for the month of 0ctoberl94C] 339. (1) The recall of the Iranian Ambassador at Ankara has been a subject of speculation among the Iranian officials in Zahidan. It is generally thought that the Ambassador’s sudden return was a. direct result of his recent speech, in which he affirmed that in the event of Turkey becoming a belligerent Iran would stand shoulder to shoulder with her. Local Iranian officials consider that only in certain special circumstances would the Saadabad pact form the basis of a military alliance,and they do not at present visualize their Government giving armed help to Turkey. (2) M. Molotov’s recent visit to Berlin has caused great disappointment in Zahidan, where it is feared that Russia may have taken advantage of the present opportunity to come to some under standing with Germany which would give her control over the northern half of Iran, and effectively neutralise any action which Turkey might take. (3) German propaganda in the Iranianjiewspapers which has represented that, as in the case of Poland, Britain has given no help to Greece, has so far been completely successful. The Iranians, while admiring the successful way in which the Greeks have been tackling the invader, are convinced that another ally of Britain is being left in the lurch, and think that after this no other small country will rely on British promises of assistance. v (4) The action of the British Government in arranging for the safe transport of pilgrims to the Holy Places of Islam.and for a reduction in the shipping fares has been welcomed by religious circles in Zahidan. A very favourable comparison has been drawn between this action of the British Government and various misdeeds of the self-styled Protector of Islam. (5) The Iranian public has welcomed Mr.Rooseveldt* s re-elec^r tion, and the general opinion as to its effect is expressed by the exclamation of an Iranian military officer who^nearing the.news said ”kamar-i-Inglees ra mohkam khwahad kard n (that will stiffen Britain’s back l) 340. Monsieur Graeffe, when passing through Zahidan,mentioned that news he has received from several sources in occupied as well as unoccupied France shov/s that a great swing of opinion in favour of Britain has recently taken place in that country. BROADCASTING. &lt;341. On a number of nights recently the broadcasts of Persian news from Berlin has been inaudible in Zahidan. The reception from Delhi on the other hand has been excellent and local Iranian offi cials have appreciated hearing the news in real (as opposed to Kabuli) Persian every night. MBKRAN. 342.

The population of Meshed and upjto 6 kilometres outside the city has been officially announced as 176,471, MILITARY AFFAIRS. 347. During the past month an# certain amount of equipment has been sent from Shiraz to the 15th Zabuli Regiment at Zahidan. It includes 300 rifles, 4 machine guns, lT37mm German gun, as well as ammunition and hand grenades. 348. During September two Iranian officers, who had received technical training abroad and were doing their conscript service at Khwash, deserted to Nok=Kurdi.The high-handed action of their Commanding Officer, who threatened that he would not release them on the termination of their service, is said to have been the - c aus e. 349. A circular has been issued by the War Ministry to the effect that any officer or other rank who in future deserts to foreign territory will be punished by the confiscation of all his property, which will be retained by*the Military authorities,and which wil] only be restored as a result of the findings of a - Military court or in accordance with the orders of the Shah himself Deserters will also lose all right to Iranian nationality. The provisions and penalties laid down in this circular |re also to be applied to all conscripts who do not report for conscript service within a month of the receipt of their summons, and to all Iranians living abroad who fail to report for conscript service when ordered. 350. When the Divisional Commander was passing through Zahi dan recently the soldiers of 3 companies of the 15th Zabuli Regi= ment made a confidential complaint to him that their Company Commanders are making money by selling the rations of the rank and file of the Regiment, and that their officers make every well-to-do conscript pay Rials 100-150 a month as M good-behaviour' money.The Divisional Commander appointed two staff officers to investigate and as a result of their enquiries one Lieutenant-a Company Commander- and one Warrant Officer of the same Company have been sent to Khwash to appear before a Court Martial and answer charges of misappropriating the rations and pay of men under their command. 351.

Over the dry bed of the Hamun the track is excellent and a considerable improvement on the main road, elsewhere it is not so good, and would be impassable along its entire length in wet weather.

POLITICAL. 323. The Zahidan Police received instructions early in Octo ber to collect all copies of a pamphlet entitled M Haqiqat-i- *Zahidan Hitler'. Copies of this pamphlet received by the*Vice Consulate from the British Press Attache*, Tehran,and already distributed, were at once withdrawn from circulation. 324. Events abroad, which have included the occupation of Rumania, the bombing of Bahrein, and the attempted invasion of Greece, have given the Iranian public plenty to think about.As on previous occasions a sharp division of opinion is noticeable in Zahidan between the young men and 'those of riper years'. The young men, both Military officers and civilians, continue to be dazzled by German successes and to applaud the latest- the occu pation of Rumania- as another feather in the cap of a great and friendly power. They hope, as they have been hoping since Septem* ber 1939, that the war will quickly And with a complete victory for fee Germany. Their seniors, while admiring^success which has attended German arms and diplomacy, still believe that the safety of Iran depends on Britain, particularly since now Turkey alone bars the way to a further German advance towards the oil areas of the Middle East. While the general public regards the Iranian Governmentfe claim to the sovereignity of the island of Bahrein as an academic question the younger men have been quifck to draw a parallel_bet ween Bahrein and Abadan, and have remarked that if the Iranians took over their own oil wells from the British the danger of air attack on Abadan would be removed. An interesting comment on the effectiveness of German Radio propaganda was recently furnished by a Major of the Iranian army when he reached Zahidan from^Headquarters of the 8th Liuxran Division at Khwash, which lies about 140 miles to the soutn. of Zahidan. The Military station at Khwash possesses a radio but has otherwise little contact with the outside world. The Wajor wished to know whether it was true that London had been so severely damaged that, even if peace were made immediately, it would take a hundred years to rebuild l• Italy*s attempted invasion of Greece, like her previous efforts in the direction of France and Egypt,have been watched here with hatred and scorn. IRANIAN TRADE WITH GERMANY. 325. Cotton piece goods of German manufacture arejoeing received from Tehran by Meshed shop-keepers and are now 1 on sale in the Meshed bazaar.

To Russia only. 1300 bales wool- weighing about 130 tons. 200 tons cotton-sent by Economic Revenue Department. BROADCASTING. 327. Reception of the various Persian broadcasts has remain ed much the same as usual throughout the past month. A criti cism of the Delhi broadcast comes from a well educated Iranian of pro-British tendencies in Meshed who said that he and his friends had grown tired of listening to the flood of abusive language used by the Berlin radio announcer in the Persian broadcasts so that they always tuned in to Delhi for their news. Recently, hov/ever, they found that the Delhi broadcasts were inclined to copy the style of the Berlin announcers and the language used was not always as well chosen as it might be. He greatly deprecated this and said it would be better if Delhi stopped this style of announcing. He pointed out that those confident of victory need not use such language, which was only resorted to by persons not sure of success. MOVEMENTS OF FOREIGNERS. 328. Herr Menkeh(?) a dealer in dried fruit arrived in Meshed from Tehran on the 30th September and later left to purchase dried fruit in Kashmor and Sabzwar. 329.
