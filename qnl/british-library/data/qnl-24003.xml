SHAIRHA AYSSHA*S CONDOLENCES ON THE LATE LORD MOYNE 1 S ASSASSIN ATION.CAMP, BAHRAIN 18th November, 1944. I enclose a translation of a letter which the Lady Ayesha, widow of His late Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa sent the Political Agent, and which he passed on to me. The Shaikha Ayesha is a surprisingly well informed lady of considerable force of character, and when I visited her venerable father this morning she appeared, and after some conversation mentioned her letter, and said that all the women of Bahrain sympathised with Lord Moyne*s family. I told her I was ing send^a copy of the letter on to you. The outrage has aroused a great deal of feeling in the Gulf, and has certainly done nothing to aid the cause of Zionism. Sir W.D.

These file notes were moved from IOR/R/15/2/1666 upon discovering that they have been previously displaced. This was discovered during cataloguing for Qatar Foundation Partnership Programme. The title on the file notes is ‘Ceremonials and Honours’ which clearly match the current file.

Among those who passed away in the Royal Family are the Empress Maria of Russia, aunt of King George V in 1928, Princess Victoria, sister of King George V in 1935, and Princess Beatrice, the last surviving daughter of Queen Victoria in 1944.

At the Bahrain Agency, flags were flown at half-mast as a mark of respect on the occasion of the funerals.The correspondence is mainly between The Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, the Political Agency in Bahrain, the British Consul in Bushire, Shaikh Hamad bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa, and Shaikha Ayshah bint Rashid al-Khalifa (widow of the late Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Ḥamad bin 'Īsá Āl Khalīfah, Hakim of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Bahrain Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000192#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
