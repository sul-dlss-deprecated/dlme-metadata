# Sakip Sabanci Museum Harvesting Documentation

* used python library Sickle to write a harvesting script; runs a bit slowly (~1 hour) because of so many deleted records
* There are four sets: Kitapvehat and ResimKlksyn have the expected number of records but abidindino and emirgan have fewer than expected (opened an issue to resolve this if possible)
