Each point raised by Merewether is outlined in further detail throughout the letter.Merewether also outlines his opinion that further military advances in this area would be less beneficial to the Government of India than if a small amount of expenditure and expertise was used to improve the position of the Khan of Kelat and to enable him to establish outposts on the route from Quettah [Quetta] to Sind in order to protect merchants.Merewether also suggests that work could be undertaken to improve irrigation to the plain between the Sind Frontier, the Murree Hills and Cutchee [Cuchi] which would provide opportunities for all the hill tribes to earn a livelihood through cultivation.Merewether concludes by discussing how his remarks would affect the neighbouring frontier of the Punjaub [Punjab], including proposing that all dealings with the Murrees and Boogtees should be handled by one political superintendent only and suggesting that Phayre settle who this should be with Captain Robert Sandeman, the politicial superintendent for the Punjaub frontier. Merewether also outlines Sandeman's other proposals including establishing a post in the Shum plain, which he concurs with; and occupying Barkhan (Lugharee) which he cites Captain Sandeman's reasons for proposing as he is not sufficiently familiar with the area himself.The letter concludes by stating that although he is opposed to further occupation he does feel that a trip through the hills, carried out by officers of both frontier lines, would be beneficial in enabling them to become acquainted with the hill tribes and to gain useful knowledge of the country and its inhabitants. He also hopes that such a trip would have the benefit of enabling the hill tribes to see how disciplined troops operate.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
