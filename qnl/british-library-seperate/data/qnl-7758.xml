The correspondence also discusses allegations made in the Hejazi press that the tribesmen are being enticed into Transjordan, and subsequent reports that the Amir of Transjordan [ʿAbdullāh bin Ḥusayn al-Hāshimī] has disclaimed any responsibility for the rumoured migrations.The file's principal correspondents are His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires at Jedda (Cecil Gervase Hope Gill), the British Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan), the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Acting High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan (Mark Aitchison Young), and various officials of the Foreign Office.In addition to letters and telegrams, the file includes a memorandum by Sir Andrew Ryan which recounts his interview with the Amir of Transjordan, in Amman, on 13 February 1932.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Transjordan</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Transjordan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Migration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00026e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00026e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
