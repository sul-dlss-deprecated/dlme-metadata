JJJJ All papers to-day publish on front page an interview given hy Stalin to Pravda correspondent dealing with Churchill’s speech, text of which is presumably already available to you, 2. Fact that Stalin himself should have replied to a private individual, however eminent, and unparallelled virulence of his language (I doubt whether even Hitler ever received such a broadside from Stalin before the war) show not only how seriously Churchill's speech has been taken here but also that Soviet Government after recovering from the initial shock, now wish to turn it to their own advantage,. 3. Stalin no doubt intended to lend his great authority to campaign begun by Pravda (my telegram No. 987) and developed by Tarle (my telegram No, 994) to frighten American and British public opinion, e,g, by his description of Churchill’s speech as a dangerous act calculated to sow discord between Allies and prejudicial to peace and security. But his interview cannot I think have been prepared mainly for foreign consumption. Most of it and in particular the comparison between Churchill and Hitler and the references to warmongers and to racial theories, is so far-fetched and puerile that it can hardly earn ajj^^^^tful hearing, still Mr. Roberts No, 1020, 14th March, 1946, Repeated to Washington IMMEDIATE- 2 - less credence, f’ruai any 'but the most convinced fellow- travellers, 4. Stalin therefore seems to have been addressing himself very much to the Soviet public, who have to be prepared for trials of strength ahead, Churchill’s speech came at an awkward moment when the Soviet Union was already launched upon what amounts to aggression in North Persia and when she hoped to avoid being exposed at U.N,0. by browbeating some Persian Government into her designs. Being already so far committed, she now has to proceed in the full glare of publicity and with a hardening of world opinion against her, above all in America and Britain, The Soviet public which is deeply disturbed by the possibility of war therefore has to be shown that, the Soviet Government, so far from embarking-upon dangerous policies, is only safeguarding vital Soviet interests against the possibility of renewed foreign intervention. At the same time Stalin reassures his people that the broad masses in Britain, as elsewhere are not behind Churchill. To reassure them still more the only British comments reproduced to-day are by Bernard Shaw who stated inter alia that Britain will not be in a state to go to war for five years and Priestley's criticism of Churchill. 5. The introduction of the note about the growth of Communist influence in accordance with the law of historical development and of Churchill's attempt to reverse this natural process is in harmony with recent ideological propaganda, . • . . 6. The general atmosphere of righteous indignation and the emphasis upon Soviet security is confirmed in leading articles in to-day’s press on the first session of/..,,*of the new Supreme Soviet which include among the great tasks before the nation the need to ensure the security of the peoples of the Soviet Union in a world in which reactionary forces are attempting to stir up dissension and hostility,, To ensure that the great victory may not have been in vain ; the economic and military might of the country and the strength of the Red Army must be increased still further, 7. It will not escape your notice that Stalin has chosen to reply to your suggestion for extending the alliance to fifty years in the text of Churchill’s speech and of his own statement that this speech was an appeal for aid against the Soviet Union inconsistent with the existing alliance c Although there is no direct reference in the interview to you or to His Majesty’s Government, Stalin s statement that serious attention cannot be paid to M false statements of Mr, Churchill’s friends in Britain' about extending the alliance is I fear intended for you, and the conclusion that 'the prolongation of the treaty has no point at all if one of the signatories to it infringes the treaty and turns it into a mere scrap of paper should be regarded as a considered statement and may even contain a threat that, if His Majesty’s Government take a similar line to that of Mr, Churchill, the Soviet Union may denounce the treaty* It should be noted that the Soviet Government have still not published the Prime Minister’s statement dissociating His Majesty's Government from any responsibility for Mr, Churchill’s speech,, The warning is reinforced by inclusion in report of Bernard Shaw’s statement of the passage about the catastrophe which would result if Churchill proposal of an Anglo-American.alliance were adopted by His Majesty’s Government, ■ d /EXT 1953 8, There has been notably little comment reproduced from America. The Soviet public is still unaware of Mr. Byrnes speech and of United States notes on Persia and Manchuria, Nor has press yet published Senator Connolly's appeal for a Big Three meeting.

His Majesty's Government have addressed to the Soviet Government an enquiry as to their intentions in respect of the withdrawal of their troops from Persia* S TeP r I have received enquiries as to whether it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to replace British troops in Persia. • No decision to that effect has been taken by His Majesty's Government nor have they taken any steps to open negotiations with the Persian Government for the return of British troops. I ought to say that we received the most categorical assurances from Generalissimo Stalin and the Soviet roverament that the integrity of Persia would be respected, and that there was no intention of taking aggressive action against her. The/....The Soviet Foreign Ministry in their reply to the representations which we made to them in November last on the subject of reported Soviet interference in the internal affairs of Persia stated that 'In so far as reference is made in your letter to the Tripartite Treaty of 1942 and the Declaration of the Three Powers on Iran, I have to state that in accordance with this treaty and declaration, the Soviet Government invariably carries out a policy of respect for the territorial integrity, suzerainty and independence of Iran.” Moreover at the time of the London meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers when the question of the withdrawal of British and oviet troops from Persia was discussed I clearly understood from Mr. Molotov that there was no difference of yiev as to the date by which Allied troops should be withdrawn under the Treaty, that is to say, by the 2nd Kerch, 1946, six months after the signing of the Japanese instrument of surrender, Jn his letter which concluded the correspondence on this subject, which I communicated to the House, Mr. Molotov asked me to bear in mind the exceptional importance which the Soviet Government attached to the strict fulfilment of their obligations. It is difficult for His Majesty’s Government to under stand the present policy of Soviet Russia in this matter, and more difficult for us to believe that all these assurances are not going to be fulfilled.&gt; f - 5 - E 18-90 1 C/ We are now awaiting the reply of the Soviet Government to the enquiries which we have addressed to them. When His Majesty's Government became a party to the resolution of the Security Council on 50th January, that direct negotiations should be undertaken between the Soviet and Persian Governments, they did so on the clear assumption that the existing treaty obligation to withdraw Allied troops from Persia on the 2nd March would be fulfilled, and His Majesty's Government would regret any settlement which appeared to be extracted from the Persian Government under duress while the &gt;oviet Army was still in occupation of part of Persia.qob' FILE GOPY OUTWARD- TELEGRAM -yV’ ' , ijr \*\ uF tt if nr ^ .P.JXv» ojPoc?^ Witte the Cornphmer t* * # * # y of the Under ‘'^• eetarv of Stfttte 1843 1 ^ MAS 1946 [This telegram is of par jicul diPSec recy] and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] [CYPHER] FLORET CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO MOSCOW No^ 741.

My immediately preceding telegram. Following is text of note: The Government of the United States has been informed that the Government of the Soviet Union has decided to retain Soviet troops in Iran after March 2nd, 1946, that this decision was taken without the consent of the Iranian Government, and that Soviet troops continue to remain on Iranian territory in spite of the protests of the Iranian Government. It will be recalled that in reply to a Note addressed on November 24th, 1945 by the Government of the United States jio the Government of the Soviet Union suggesting the u- 'linmediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iran, the Soviet Government on November 29th stated that the period of the stationing of Soviet troops in Iran was governed by the iJiglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty of January 29th, 1942. (Uu- 2 - The G-ovemment of the United States understood from this statement that it was the intention of the Government of the Soviet Union that all Soviet troops would he withdrawn from Iran not later than March 2nd, 1946, six months after the date of the signing of the instrument of surrender with Japan on September 2nd, 1945. This under standing was based upon Article V of the Tripartite Treaty referred to above which states: ’’The forces of the Allied powers shall be withdrawn from Iranian territory not later than six months after all hostilities between the Allied powers and Germany and her associates have been suspended by the conclusion of an armistice or armistices, or on the conclusion of peace between them, whichever date is the earlier”. So far as the Government of the United States is aware, this commitment was not questioned at the recent meeting of the Security Council in London which agreed that the Soviet Union and Iran should seek a solution of their differences by direct negotiation. The decision of the Soviet Government to retain Soviet troops in Iran beyond the period stipulated by the Tripartite Treaty has created a situation with regard to which the Government of the United States, as a member of the United Nations and as a party to the declaration regarding Iran dated December 1st, 1943, cannot remain indifferent. That declaration announced to the world that the Governments of the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom were ”at one with the Government of Iran in their desire for the maintenance of the independence, sovereignty...-3- sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran'*. In the opinion of the Government of the United States, the maintenance of troops in Iranian territory by any one of the three signatories to that declaration, without the consent and against the wishes of the Government of Iran, is contrary to the assurances contained in that declaration. Furthermore it was generally accepted during the various discussions which took place at the meeting of the Security Council in London that the retention by a member of the United Nations of its troops in the territory of a country which is also a member of the United Nations, v/ithout the consent of the Government of that country, is not in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and that the withdrawal of such troops should not be made contingent upon other issues. The Government cf the United States, in the spirit of the friendly association which developed between the United States and the Soviet Union in the successful effort against the common enemy and as a fellow member of the United Nations, expresses the earnest hope that the Government of the Soviet Union will do its part, by withdrawing immediately all Soviet forces from the territory of Iran, to promote the international confidence which is necessary for peaceful progress among the peoples of all nations.

GUIDANCE CIRCULAR JJJ Although some signs of evacuation have been seen withdrawal of Soviet troops by March 2nd is now unlikely. February 24th Persian Prime Minister informed His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires in Moscow that the Azerbaijan question was very difficult and that he did not expect Soviet troops to leave Persia by March 2nd. He said he must stay in Moscow a few days longer. Deputies believe that he will not return before March 11th on which date Fourteenth Majlis comes to an end. 2. Minister of Commerce and Industry is replacing all prominent non-Tudeh officials and engineers by Tudeh, Tudeh men also being placed in key positions in the Ministry of Justice regardless of status. General Firouz as Acting Minister of the Interior dismissed head of the Gendarmerie presumably with an eye to the elections. He is at present running the gendarmerie himself as the Shah objected to the appointment of Razmara or a cousin of General Firouz. 5. There are signs of a concerted movement against the Shah and the Pahlevi regime. With Muzaffar Firouz as Political Under-Secretary and Director of Propaganda this is not surprising. Shah is known to be anxious.- 2 - 4. Maximov Soviet Ambassador is to be replaced by present Soviet Ambassador in Belgrade. 5. Last British troops leave Persia by midnight March lst/2nd. 6. Acting Press Attach^ just returned from tv/o weeks in the north and north-west. In spite of clear itinerary on his Russian pass Russians refused to let him stay at Gurgan or to travel from Shahi to Tehran by road where drilling for oil is proceeding. Democrats in Zenjan seemed calm and prepared to maintain present situation indefinitely leaving it to the Persian Government to make the first approach. 7. Line to take if Soviet troops do not withdraw by March 2nd is that under the resolution adopted by the Security Council it is open to Persia to appeal again for assistance. Petitions or telegrams addressed to Persian Government, Majlis or the press recommending this action need not be discouraged. 8.

My immediately preceding telegram. Following is text of note: The Government of the United States has been informed that the Government of the Soviet Union has decided to retain Soviet troops in Iran after March 2nd, 1946, that this decision was taken without the consent of the Iranian Government, and that Soviet troops continue to remain on Iranian territory in spite of the protests of the Iranian Government. It will be recalled that in reply to a Note addressed on November 24th, 1945 by the Government of the United States to the Government of the Soviet Union suggesting the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iran, the Soviet Government on November 29th stated that the period of the stationing of Soviet troops in Iran was governed by the Aiglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty of January 29th, 1942. The■ I - 2 - The Government of the United States understood from this statement that it was the intention of the Government of the Soviet Union that all Soviet troops would he withdrawn from Iran not later than March 2nd, 1946, six months after the date of the signing of the instrument of surrender with Japan on September 2nd, 1945. This under standing was based upon Article V of the Tripartite Treaty referred to above which states: ,f The forces of the Allied powers shall be withdrawn from j Iranian territory not later than six months after all hostilities between the Allied powers and Germany and her associates have been suspended by the conclusion of an armistice or armistices, or on the conclusion of peace between them, whichever date is the earlier”. So far as the Government of the United States is aware, this commitment was not questioned at the recent meeting of the Security Council in London which agreed that the Soviet Union and Iran should seek a solution of their differences by direct negotiation. The decision of the Soviet Government to retain Soviet troops in Iran beyond the period stipulated by the Tripartite Treaty has created a situation with regard to which the Government of the United States, as a member of the United Nations and as a party to the declaration regarding Iran dated December 1st, 1943, cannot remain indifferent. That declaration announced to the world that the Governments of the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom were ”at one with the Government of Iran in their desire for the maintenance of the independence r sovereignty...-3- \ sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran u . In the opinion of the G-overnment of the United States, the maintenance of troops in Iranian territory by any one of the three signatories to that declaration, without the consent and against the wishes of the Government of Iran, is contrary to the assurances contained in that declaration. Furthermore it was generally accepted during the various discussions which took place at the meeting of the Security Council in London that the retention by a member of the United Nations of its troops in the territory of a country which is also a member of the United Nations, without the consent of the Government of that country, is not in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and that the withdrawal of such troops should not be made contingent upon other issues. The Government of the United States, in the spirit of the friendly association which developed between the United States and the Soviet Union in the successful effort against the common enemy and as a fellow member of the United Nations, expresses the earnest hope that the Government of the Soviet Union will do its part, by withdrawing immediately all Soviet forces from the territory of Iran, to promote the international confidence which is necessary for peaceful progress among the peoples of all nations.

Disquiet is reflected in the Press which considers compromise is no longer possible and that therefore the issue must be faced.

It is therefore now clear that evacuation cannot be finished in time, although they may conceivably begin an evacuation on March 2nd, and claim that this meets the treaty requirements. 3c State Department's view appears to be that not being signatory to 1942 treaty, United States Government has less standing than Persia and His Majesty’s Government for initial protest. 4.

This may he due to the usual clumsy drafting of Soviet pronouncements, or it may be deliberate ambiguity. 2, You will also note that Soviet statement (A) gives no reason why withdrawal in the 'relatively quieter’ districts has not been completed by March 2nd. (B) does not claim that Persian Prime Minister has agreed or even that matter was discussed with him, but only that h^ was informed as long ago as February 25th (no doubt Soviet Government have been vainly exerting pressure since then to secure his agreement) and (C) that no mentio made of the tripartite treaty or even of the 1921 treaty. 5.

IMPORTANT corres- with- Your despatch No. 304 of December 20th transmitting pondence exchanged with American Embassy in London abou- drawal of Soviet troops from Persia. At tne conference in Moscow Stalin said to Mr. Byrnes, though not to hr. Bevin, that Soviet-Fersian Treaty of 1921 would justify the retention of Soviet troops in Persia after March 2nd because (I understand) of the alleged hostility of the Persian Government to the Soviet Government. If Mr. Byrnes had been acquainted with the 1921 Treaty and above all with subsequent exchange of letters (state papers 1921 psge 908) he could have asked Stalin to give evidence of the M preparations for considerable armed attack by partisans of Czarist regime and to name the foreign power or powers who might be intending to assist such a scheme. Unfortunately the opportunity was allowed to pass. 2. So far as I know Soviet reply included in the above mentioned correspondence has not been published and it has therefore not been possible to draw attention, as Mr. Howe suggested, to ominous reference to the Treaty of 1921. I suggest the Soviet reply (if translation supplied by American 1*4 Embassy in London is correct) implies that the Soviet Government feel they could invoke the treaty of 1921 but do not intend to do so but to regard the.time limit fornstention of Soviet troops in Pflr'QTQ Q CJ 'Krr AV, ^ A A J A „ m l _ j, n ^ in Persia as governed by the tripartite Treaty of 1942.

I fear that if the matter is not discussed now the Soviet Government may overstep the limit of March 2nd and having broken the pledge given under the Treaty of 1942 they will remain on indefinitely or u ntil P ersia h as b een completely subjugated. ^ ^5. If the correspondence between the United States and Sovi^v- Governments cannot be published, article published in, I think, Pravda by Zaroslavsky during the Moscow Conference would serve as a peg on which to hang the discussion.

H The Government of Iran has informed the Government of the United States that armed uprising have taken place in areas of Northern Iran where Soviet troops are stationed; that the Iranian Government has directed certain of its armed forces to enter those areas for the purpose of reestablishing internal security and its own authority— that Soviet military corrmanders have refused to permit these forces to proceed; and that consequently the Iranian Government has not been able to carry out its responsibility for the maintenance of peace and order in Iranian territory. 'It will be recalled that on December 1, 1943» Marshal Stalin, Prime Minister Churchill and president Roosevelt signed in Tehran a declaration in which they stated that their Governments were ’at one with the Government of Iran in their desire for the maintenance of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran.’ This Government has entire confidence that the Governments of the Soviet Union and Great Britain are just as zealous as the Government of the United States meticulously to abide by the assurances contained in this declaration. In the view of this Government the fulfillment of these assurances requires that the Government of Iran should have full freedom, without interference from Soviet, British, or American military or civil authorities, R.G. Howe, Esq., C.M.G. /to The Foreign Office Whitehall, S.W.1.to move ita armed forces through. Iran in such a manner as ic ; 'ay consider necessary in order to preserve its authority and to maintain internal security* 'The Government of the United States realizes that any Soviet commanders in the areas concerned who may have prevented the free movement of Iranian forces may have been ^ without the sanction of the Soviet Government* If the Soviet commanders have been acting without instructions in this matter, it is assumed that the Soviet Governnent is issuing to them instructions in keeping with the declaration referred to above. In any event, the situation which has arisen has convinced the American Government that it would be in the common interest for all Soviet, British, and American troops to be withdrawn immediately from Iran* As long as any of these troops remain in the territory of a friendly Government, incidents and misunderstandings are likely to occur* The Government of the United States has already reduced its forces in Iran during the present year from a maximum strength of approximately 28,000 to less than 6,000. There are no American combat troops in Iran. Those who remain are engaged in activities exclusively of a service nature connected with the liquidation and disposal of military supplies and the operation of certain important communications connected with demobilization. While the immediate withdrawal of these troops will cause considerable inconvenience to this Government, nevertheless, instructions are being issued to the American military authorities in Iran to take inxnediate steps to effect the complete withdrawal of all American forces from Iran by January 1, 1946. This Government proposes that the British and Soviet Governments issue similar instructions to their commanders and that arrangements be made imnediately for the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iran by January 1, 1946. Immediate steps to effect such withdrawal would dispel any doubt regarding the intentions of the three Governments to carry out the assurances given by them. In making this suggestion the Government of the United States is aware that no undertaking has been given that thesj troops are /to bewarn to be remoyed from Iran before BS-rct 2 f 1JU6- On the other hand, now that hostilities have ceased, itLseea nb compelling reason for them to remain until that date. fE'Ts of - the opinion that an immediate step to effect withdrawal by January 1 not only would obviate possible misunderstandings but^would also be a fitting recognition of the notable cr&gt;ibutions f which Iran, a member in good standing of the United Nations, has made to the common war effort. 'Nations such as Iran were encouraged at the United Nations Conference at San Francisco to place full trust in the friendly intentions and good will of the permanent members of the Security Council. The Government of the United States is confident that the Soviet Government and Great Britain are no less anxious than the United States, in dealing with nations such as Iran, to follow a line of action which will make it clear that the trust of these nations in the permanent members of the Security Council has not been misplaced. 'Similar proposals are being made to the Soviet Government”. The Department of State expresses the hope that the British Government will find it possible to agree to this proposal and states that an urgent reply would be welcome. Sincerely, (Signed) W.J. GallmanCOPY 159573/103/34) &lt; No.E. 9473 / 103 / 3 U Secret. \ f r FOREI GN OFFICE, S.W. 1 . My dear Gallman, “ &gt;? V'T JC&lt; A 12 th 6310 December, 1 945* In the course of your letter of the 4th December, in which you were good enough to inform us of the text of the oviet Government s reply to your Government^ conrnunication proposing the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Persia by the 1 st January 1940, you invited our comments on the . vaiious statements contained in the Soviet Governments reply. there is one point in the Soviet reply to which we should like to draw your particular attention and that is the reference to the Soviet—Persian Treaty of the 26 th February, 1921 . Article 6 of that Treaty provides, as you Know, that if a third country attempts by means of armed intervention to realise a rapacious policy in the territory of Persia, or toturn the territory of Persia into a base for military action against the Soviet Union, and if the Persian Government, after warning by the Soviet Government, shall prove itself to be not strong enough to prevent this danger, the Soviet Government shall have the right to take its troops into Persian territory in order to take the necessary military measures in the interests of self-defence, ihe Article concludes that, when the danger has been removed, the Soviet Government promises immediately to withdraw its troops beyond the frontiers of Persia. vv ' e find it very difficult to see what relevance this clause of the 1921 Treaty can have to the question of the withdrawal of Soviet troops in present circumstances. And if it has any relevance, then it would appear to justify by implication the retention of Soviet troops not only after the 1st January but after the expiry of the' Treaty period for their withdrawal. The State Department may care to consider, when the text of the Soviet reply has been made public either in Washington or Moscow, the desirability of drawing attention to the rather ominous implications of this part of the Soviet reply. Mr. Waldemar J. Gallman, Yours sincerely. United States Embassy, (Signed) R.G.Howe. 1 , Grosvenor Square, W. 1 .COPY (E94«/103/34) SiSCKi^r. ElvlBASSY op the united STATES OP AMERICA, LONDON. 4th December, 1945* Dear Howe, ^ V^ith reference to my letter of 26th November transmitting a communication from my Government proposing the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iran by 1st January, 1946, the Embassy has been requested by the Department of State to furnish you the following text of a communication received from the Soviet Government in reply to a similar proposal: ''The statement made in that communication concerning the armed uprising in Northern Iran does not, according to information at the disposal of the Soviet Government, correspond to reality# The events which have taken place in recent days in Iran not only do not constitute: an armed uprising but also are not directed against the Shahinshah Government of Iran. Now that the declaration of the Popular Assembly of Northern Iran has been published, it is evident that this is a matter of aspirations with respect to assurances of the democratic rights of the Azerbeidjanian population of Northern Iran, which is seeking national autonomy within the limits of the Iranian state and which has its own particular language different from the Persian language. It is also apparent from the contents of the above mentioned declaration of the Popular Assembly which took place in Tabriz 20th to 21st November that the Popular Assembly addressed the expression of its wishes to the Shah, the Majlis and the Government of Iran, basing itself* in this on the Iranian constitution. The undesirable incidents predicated in conjunction with these recent events at various points of Northern Iran have been caused by reactionary elements which have opposed the extension of national rights to the populations of Northern Iran, although there is nothing in these desires of the local population which is unusual for a democratic state# . . 'As far as the Soviet military command is concerned, it has not hindered and is not hindering the movements of the Iranian military forces and gendarme police units which are in the districts of Northern Iran. According to information at the disposal of the Soviet Government there are in these districts of Iran one infantry regiment, two infantry brigades, two regiments of gendarme police units, the presence of which can assure order and calm in these parts#. The Soviet Government opposed the desx^atch of new Iranian troops to northern districts of Iran and informed the Iranian Government that the despatch of further Iranian forces to Northern Iran could cause not the cessation but the increase of the disorders and likewise bloodshed, which would compel the Soviet Government to introduce into Iran further forces of its own for the purpose of preserving order and of assuring the security of Soviet garrisons. Inasmuch as the Soviet Government considers the further introduction of Soviet forces into Iran undesirable, it took the position that the introduction of new Iranian forces into the northern province of Iran at the present time would serve no useful purpose. 'As to the reference in the communication of the Government of the United States to the three-power declaration concerning Iran of 1st December, 1943* the Soviet Government as far as it is concerned must state that it adheres unwaveringly to the principals of that declaration. The declaration in question however does not affect questions of the number of Soviet armed forces on Iranian territory- just as it does not affect the question of the period of the stationing of Soviet troops in Iran. This latter is determined by another document, namely, the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Tripartite Treaty of 1942, and in connection with Soviet troops the Government of the R.G.Howe Esq., C.M.G. , The Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.1. Union/.. • X32nion of boviet Socialist Republics is guided strictly by the time limits established in that treaty for the stationing of its trooos in Iran notwithstanding the fact that the right of introduction of Soviet ^oops into the territory of Iran was envisaged by the Soviet- February 19^1 Furthermore, as the Government of the Lnited otates is aware, the question of the time for the removal of Soviet and British troops from Iran was subject of * consideration at the Council of Foreign Ministers in London as little us two months ago and was decided by exchange of letters between the Soviet and British representatives which was brought to the ^— attention of the above mentioned Council of Ministers and which did ^ 00 J® c ^i° n ln ^by quarters* In connection with the above it shoui.d also be noted that the British Government in its note on the Iranian question, received by the Soviet Government on 29th November. does not raise the question of the removal of Soviet trooos from I ran* . . wn s ' br 9 n g' t N of the considerations set forth above with relations to Soviet troops, the Government of the Union of Soviet ^©publics does not see grounds for renewed consideration of the question of ohe time limit for the removal of Soviet forces xrom Iran . We have been asked to say .that the United States Government would welcome any comments which the British Government might care to make regarding the various statements contained in the foregoing; renlv of the Soviet Government. 6 ** In its instruction to the Embassy the Department of State emphasized that the note of the Soviet Government would not be made public in Washington until Soviet authorization had been Obtained and that it tfas desired to postpone publication in ,the United Aingdom or elsewhere until it had first been published in the United States of the Soviet Union.

During this conversation Soviet Under Secretary of State referred to exchange of letters between yourself and Molotov in London, When Persian Ambassador said this was the first he had heard of it he was informed in reply that the text of the letters was net handy but that he would be pleased to know that it augured well for relations between their tv/ocountries* _ The Persian Ambassador then appears to have made enquiries of his various colleagues in Moscow and in reporting this conversation mentioned March 2nd as the date on which evacuation should be completed.

Mr. Eden asked the Secretary of State for Fqreign Affairs whether he has any statement to make about the withdrawal of Allied troops from Persia. Mr. Bevin: I am indebted to the right hon. Member for giving me the opportunity of informing the House on the subiect. The House will remember that the question of Persia • was discussed at Potsdam, and that an arrangement was made for the immediate withdrawal of Allied forces from lehran. The British withdrawal under this arrangement has now been almost completed, and M. Molotov has assured me that the decision regarding the withdrawal of troops from Tehran has been put into effect from the Soviet side. It was also agreed at Potsdam that the question of further stages in the withdrawal •. of Allied troops from Persia should be discussed at the lirst meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Since Potsdam, of course, the position has been changed by the ending of the ib- Japanese war, which automatically brings into effect the provision of the Anglo-Soviet Persian treaty that British and Soviet troops will complete their withdrawal from Persia tvithin six months of the end of hostilities. But since the question was on the agenda of the Council I thought it as well to make His Majesty s Government s views on the matternuite clear, and I therefore wrote the following letter to M. Molotov: ■'Since it was decided at Potsdam that the question of further stages in the withdrawal of Allied troops from Persia should be placed on the agenda of the Council of Foreign Ministers'the situation has Been changed by the ending of the Japanese war. Our two Governments will now be completing the withdrawal of their forces from Persia by 2nd' March, 1946, six months after the signing of the Japanese Instrumfent of Surrender and, as far as the end of ^ / our... RECa. H3L. ClPr. |** \*+ - 2 - our withdrawal is concerned, all that we need do is to ash the Council to take note of the 2nd March 1946, as v * the date fixed. # • '* It seens to me, however, that since (pur respective * forces in Persia have conplexed the war-time tasks for which they were sent to Persia, our Governments might well see if they could not do something to satisfy the Persian Government s natural desire to see as much of its territory as possible freed as soon as possible from the presence of foreign forces. ... I therefore propose to suggest, when the question comes up at the Council of Foreign Ministers, thatjour two Governments shall agree that by the middle of December, 1945, their respective forces shall be withdrawn from the whole of Persia^ except that British forces may remain until the 2nd March, 1946 in the southern oil area to the south of, aid.including, Pjidimishk. and that Spviet forces may remain until the 2nd March 1946, in Azarbaijan. v I shquld propose excepting from this arrangement the minimum^administrative staffs necessaiy for disposing of military installations; these staffs could remain where there are such installations until they had arranged for their disposal; they would, ot course, be withdrawn like our other forces by the 2nd iiarch, 1946. I have thought it well to let you know in advance of my intention to put forward this proposalwhen the matter comes up at the Council of Foreign Ministers.” To /this M. Molotov replied in the following letter: ”Thank you for informing me in your letter of 19th September of the British Government s attitude on the question of the withdrawal of British and Soviet troops from Iran. I must in turn inform you that the decision of the Berlin Three Power Conference regarding the withdrawal ol troops. from Tehran has already been pub into effect from the Soviet side. As regards the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran, the Soviet Government, as you are aware, take the view that this withdrawal of troops should be effected within the period laid down in the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty. If necessaiy, the plan for the final withdrawal of Soviet and British troops from Iran could be discussed between us uowards the end of the said'period. The Soviet Government, pcoo^dingly, see no need for this question to be discussed in t^ie Council of Foreign.Ministers”. • . .* ■ As a result of this exchange of letters which underlined the intention of both British and Spviet Governments to stand by their treaty obligations to Persia, when the question came up before the Council on 22nd September M.Molorov and I . informed the Council that the exchange of letters had taken place. The Council took note of the fact that letters on. this matter had been exchanged between us and agreed that m view off this there was no necessity for the question of + the withdrawal of troops from Iran to be discussed, and that the item should therefore be removed from the Agenda of the Conference. In a further letter I wrote to M.Molotov as follows: ”1 aia glad that we have reached so cordial understandingOUTWARD TELEGRAM on the question of the withdrawal of Allied troops frou Persia at)out which I wrote to you on September 19th and you replied on September 20th.

It seems to me, however, that since our / respect!.e forces in Persia nave completed the war time tc |\§/ for which they were sent to Persia, our governments might well see if they could not do something to satisfy the Persian Government f s natural desire to see as much of its^territory as possible freed as soon as possible fe£ the presence of foreign forces. . I therefore propose to suggest, when the question comes up at the Council of Foreign Ministers, that our two governments shall agree that by the middle of December, 194p, their respective forces shall bo withdrawn from the whole of Persia except that British forces may remain until the 2nd March, 1946 in the southern oil area to the south of, and including Andlmi jhk, and that Soviet forces may remain until the 2nd 1 t /ch, 1946 in Azarbaijan.

Subject to your .en our views, I would suggest that we should get the Foreign Office to repeat the telegram to the Government of India, or that we should send a seperatei* telegram ourselves. I discussed this question, and oth^ questions connected with Persia, at some length with General Sir Arthur Smith (the late G.O.C. in C. Iraq/Persia Command) last Monday. He is not perturbed at the idea of the withdrawal of British/Indian forces from the A.I.O.C. concession areas and thinks that their future security can, and will be, ensured by keeping on good terras with the LURS, BAKHTIARIS and KUGHILUS (the time honoured custom of buying them off 1)• Prom what I have seen of the Persian Army, I cannot believe that the /presencepresence of Persian troops in the area will serve any useful purpose - rather the contrary; but gendarmerie is quite a different thing and would probably be useful.

Since it is not intended that any British air lines should run to Persia after expiry of the tripartite treaty, I suggest that it would be better for British Overseas Airways Company service to cease by October 2nd when the withdrawal of main body of Royal Air Force and British military forces will have been effected. 2. Reasons are 1) in view of Egyptian attitude continuation even for further five months is apparently doubtful 2) number of British official passengers after troops leave Tehran is likely to be very small 5) if British Overseas Airways Company carry the main private individuals on commercial basis Persians may reasonably argue that this is abuse of treaty facilities 4) provision by Royal Air Force of regular ground services involve keeping substantial numbers of Royal Air Force personnel in Tehran after the other troops have gone with consequential administrative complications 5) there will be considerable technical difficulties in running essential \ signals services efficiently 6) I understand meteorological stations at Hamadan, Kermanshah and Isfahan are not in practice necessary I for forecasts for Persian Gulf route so that if British Overseas 5 Airways Company Tehran and Bagdad service ceases they and their wireless station could also be withdrawn 7) complete withdrawal of Royal xiir Force and cessation of military air service would put us in much stronger position vis-a-vis the Russians who could hardly justify the retention of Qaleh.Morgheh air field or continuation . of their present cabotage services under military guise 8) Americans would similarly have to come into the open about their A.T.C. service land French about military air line 9) retention of moribund service is/..».

This permission will come to an end with the expiry of the Treaty when Allied forces are completely- withdrawn from Persia. In any case it is unlikely that the Egyptians will agree to B.O.A.C. operating civil air services based on Egypt to neighbouring Middle East countries after the war justification for these services has passed. They are already complaining that their own airline is suffering from this B.O.A.C. competition. 2. In our post-war plans for overseas air services, Persia v/ill not be served by any British airline, though a service from Egypt to Tehran might be.operated by the new Anglo-Egyptian company if and when it is set up. Passengers to Persia could travel as far as Bagdad on the British trunk services to the East and from there to Tehran by the local Iraqi or Persian company. B.O.A.C.. are in touch with local interests in both countries and it is our intention that they should act as technical advisers to both the Iraqi State airline and to the main Persian airline company. 3. We do not therefore wish to negotiate a long term agreement with Persian Government. The immediate problem is that of handing back Mehrabad airfield to Persian control now while retaining such rights and. facilities as will be needed to keep B.O.A.C. service in ^ operation until the expiry of the Treaty, or until B.O.A.^. s permission to operate services based on Egypt is terminated, (whichever date is earlier).

Repeated to M.E.iiin. 1 s Office (Cairo) General Headquarters Middle E SAVING PAIC 8 8 8 8 My telegram No. 873 (repeated saving except to Washington) was ready for despatch when I received year telegram No. 522. I sent it as it was because it will I hope explain why I find it disappointing that neither alternatives you discuss envisages total withdrawal before latest date permissible under Tripartite Treaty. I realise difficulty of getting Russians to leave-the country altogether before they must, but I very much hope that attempt will be made. 2. Course (1) is I suggest excluded by political situation as a first line of approach to Russians. It is tantamount to saying publicly that, except in regard to Tehran concession already announced (and it.should be remembered that occupation of Tehran which is well outside of British and Russian zones was never formally agreed by Persian Government) the Allies regard themselves as free to profit to the utmost by [grp. undec.J of the Treaty, and will remain in large areas of.Persia long after any excuse remains for so doing that public could, understand. This would have profoundly discouraging effect on overwhelming majority of population, and would correspondingly encourage Tudeh mischief makers. It would suit the Russians admirably since they would be free to effect last minute evacuation. Having.land lines of communication and no installations of importance they can without the slightest difficulty withdraw at the eleventh hour. 5, While this Embassy in accordance with instructions contained in paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 453 has been careful to say nothing to the Persians about the prospect of discussion by the Council of Foreign Ministers of further stages of evacuation, it would.appear that.no such disrepancy was enjoined on my Soviet and American colleagues both of whom mentioned the prospect to the PersianBNWMBHP li9EfiBES9B9S - 2 - Persian Government. Persians have been qujrk to note a §ood deal of disrepancy and if the result of the Council's deliberations turns out as disappointingly negative as course (1), conclusion might well be drawn (with or without Russian prompting) that it was we who had all along been putting on the brake. When announcing to the minister for Foreign Affairs intention of Soviet forces to evacuate everyone, Soviet Ambassador after claiming * that there were hardly any Soviet forces to remove said it was regrettable that'the capital had ever been occupied: Soviet authorities had brought in some troops tp protect..’ Stalin at the Conference and finding British troops here had left their own. It is true - unfortunately - that we first brought troops to Tehran and then in a fit of absence of mind added area Headquarters. 4. As to course (2) can we not at least propose to Russians a total pari passu withdrawal in much less than six months? The British troops were anyhow to evacuate the summer camps by November 1st and they will no longer be needed for protection of oil area as a wartime interest; peacetime risks i.e. labour and tribal unrest we must anyhow face before long without assistance of British troops. though to reduce those risks to a minimum Kis Majesty’s Embassy are about to invite Persian Government to discuss special security measures for that area. As regards protection of air communications for return, of troops from the Far East, we can no longer deny the Persian right to insist on providing for a guard for us. 5. The only delaying factors are thus physical difficulties, transport and disposal of assets, A delay of six months is surely much too long for surmounting these in view of political issues at stake. 6. I had much hoped that v/e could inform the Russians of our readiness to effect total withdrawal from the vicinity by about December 12th, i.e. dateon which Persian general elections are due to be held or at least soon after. For reasons given in paragraph 3 above. Russians cannot pretend to avert physical or administrative difficulties [grp. undec.l their going as soon. If they reject the proposals merely on the ground that they ought to H see no reason to hurry' we can at least ensure (as I have frequently urged) that it should be generally known to Persia and the world in general that the blame for delay does not lie.with us. Persistent press commentaries enquring just why Russians are so anxious to remain in an independent and Allied country.till last possible moment would at least hamper the Russian schemes for completing their Persian haymaking before the treaty sun sets. Public is beginning to show up their activities in other countries - countries which through having been on the wrong side have far less claim to general sympathy - and it undoubtedly cramps their style. In this connexion please see my telegram No. 851 about censorship, which remains one of the principal keys to the whole problem (your telegram No. 529 now received). 7.A - 3 - 7. On a point of detail, the last sentence of your paragraph 2 overlooks that Kermanshah camp is really at Bisitun outside our ’’zone” and would therefore have to be evacuated as well as QUM Ramadan and Sultanabad. For reaons given above however merely to withdraw to our respective zones as an intermediate stage would be hardly better than course (1). Foreign Office please pass to Government of India and Washington as my telegrams Nos, 253 and 55 respectively. O.T.P. [Repeated to Washington under Foreign Office No. 8744]. [Copies sent to Telegraph Branch India Office for repetition to Government of India].Please see the Government of India's telegram No, 7250 of the 18th August and the note by the General Staff (India) to irtiich they refer. This note was fully commented on at the time in the minutes which will be found immediately above it, and we would in particular invite attention to General Mayne's note of 19th July. It will be remembered that we did not pass the memorandum on to the Foreign Office at the time but the Secretary of State replied to the Viceroy to the effect that it would be best for the moment to await the results of the Potsdam Conference, The developments since then have been that the Russians, the Americans and ourselves are all going ahead with our arrangements for the evacuation of Tehran. As will be seen from Tehran telegram No. 825, the Russians are apparently doing this with all speed, which is made easier for them by the fact that they have no assets of any importance in Tehran, nor are their headquarters there It is no doubt true, as Government of India say in their telegram No. 7250, that the end of the war with Japan is likely to stimulate the Russians to intensify their efforts to achieve the objects they have in view before the six months period elapses.* This is regrettable, but it may be doubted whether the course of action which they are likely to pursue will differ in kind from the way in which they have been behaving oyer the last two or three years. In any case, it is difficult to see how we can exercise much effective check on the Russians by adopting a stronger policy on the line indicated in the General Staff paper. Jl* Government of India are, of cqurse, entitled to have full consideration given to their]views, and in the light of their latest telegram it is suggested that we might send a copy of General Staff' s paper to the r oreign Office, asking that it should be given the funest consideration in connection with the preparation of the brief for the British Delegation to the forthcoming meeting of Foreign Ministers,which is to consider the further stages in the withdrawal of the Allied Forces from Persia. #• x ru nUu, c kn f’' ^ , /&amp; 'UvkJ i gy/Z /v.B.

You will see that Sir R.

If this proposal is accepted the demarcation of the with drawal zones can be worked out afterwards. [Ends.] 2. It was on these lines that we had proposed to take up discussion of the further stages of withdrawal at the Foreign Secretaries meeting in September, but with1 - 2 - the cessation of hostilities with Japan and the con sequent obligation on the British and Soviet govern ments to complete withdrawal of their forces by mid February, 1946, a new situation arises. Two alternative courses of action at the Foreign Secretaries meeting now seem possible. (1) to propose simply that the American, British and Soviet governments should agree on the exact date in February, 1946, by which withdrawal of their forces must be completed and that the date fixed should be published. - (2) to act as in (1) above and to propose in addition that there should be an intermediate time limit, say 3 months before the final evacuation date, by which time British and Soviet troops would have to withdraw to specified zones in Persia. These withdrawals could be defined either on the lines of stage 2 of our Potsdam proposals, which would.involve on our part withdrawal from the Kermanshah camps, or as a withdrawal to the British and Russian zones as defined in writing in -iugust, 1941, this would involve our withdrawal from Qum, Hamadan and Sultanabad and Russian withdrawal from Meshed and the rest of North East Persia up to Shahrud. 3. Course (2) has the advantages that, if accepted, it frees a considerable area of Persia before the final withdrav/al date, that it preserves the principle that we withdraw only to the extent to which the Russians do, and that it does something to prevent a situation arising in which, when the final evacuation date approaches, we might have withdrawn most of our forces while the Russians had withdrawn from nowhere but Tehran.^ It has, however, the serious disadvantage that it is un likely to be acceptable to the Russians who will almost certainly argue that, since they will in any case withdraw their forces by mid February, discussion of an \ intermediate stage is unnecessary. 4. It may therefore be that it ?/ould be hotter to adopt course (1). It has the advantages that it is simple, that the Russians can hardly refuse.to agree to it and that it leaves our military authorities free to arrange the withdrawal of our forces in whatever way is administratively most convenient. I should be glad if you would comment urgently. &gt; 5. The above is for your own information only and should not be communicated to the Persians. !_Copies sent to. QiT'Ss G-rlgg'inrd Mr. ijrmstrong.

It was now the duty of the Russians towards British and American public opinion to contribute to the success of the Labour Government. Unfort unately article printed in “Daily Mail” and broadcast by B.B.C. had awakened disagreeable suspicions by suggesting that it was not to be expected that Persia v/ould now,be evacuated by Allied armies. VJr iter then went on to point out that oc cun at ion of Persia was not due to any act of hostility on her part. She had rendered valuable service to the Allies by assuring the passage of supplies to Russia and the Groat Powers had guaranteed the provisional character of the occupation. Perhaps best proof of agreement between the Great Powers would be end of the occupation of Persia since it was there that Imperialist ambitions were strongest. The Potsdam Conference would show whether the independence of innocent nations would be sacrificed to the rivalry of the Great Powers or whether good intentions would really prevail. f BECo.

He received it with - • profound gloom. He had he said been confidently hoping for much more (unfortunately during the week we have been waiting for the Russians. Tehran has been full of ‘’circumstantial ' 1 rumours of total evacuation of Persia within three months) and subversive elements would merely be encouraged to conclude that this was the utmost that British and Americans would ever be able to wring from Soviet Government. I urged him to be more thankful for considerable mercies. Evacuation of capital was an important development which would do much to rehabilitate prestige of Persian Government if they played their part with dignity and courage. 2. Minister for Foreign Mffairs enquired pointedly why he had still heard nothing from Soviet Ambassador. He expressed the view that it would be unwise for Persian Government to make any public announcement pending Russian confirmation. I said we had been waiting for Russians who were often slow in such matter: but there could be no doubt whatever as to our facts and I imagined the news would be broadcast in United Kingdom now that Persian Government had been informed. (In point of fact United States Ambassador too has still received nothing from his Government on this subject). 3. Minister for Foreign Affairs repeatedly asked whether /’’Tehran”» » i j i 'Tehran” meant the town alone or a surrounding district and if the latter what its boundaries were. -I replied boundaries were a matter for future discussion between ourselves and the Russians.

My conviction has been strengthened by events that have occurred since viz„ y 1) Soviet propaganda from Radio Tehran which caused even Persians to revolt. 2) Soviet protest about press mentioned in my telegram 742. 3) Violent campaign being conducted in the north by Soviet Trades Unions delegates who hold meetings at all factories and railway stations* These delegates were forced on Persian Government by the Russians and Persian authorities have no control whatsoever over their movements or their speeches. 4) Continued inability of judicial authorities to bring anyone to book for the two recent murders one in Tehran one in Isfahan. 5) Violent abuse of two prominent Persians by the Soviet Ambassador at a party, as enemies of Russia. Fault in one case is that a deputy refuses to vote with the minority in the Majlis, in the other, that a General of character whom the Russians tried to induce to be a dictator for them has not responded. 2. Behaviour of Soviet Ambassador in general resembles that of a CoM^esar in a Baltic State rather than that of a diplomat in a foreign independent country. How far he is backed by the Soviet Government one can only guess. Probably if he pulled off a coup he would be approved, but let us hope that the publicity about Persia which is now happily beginning will frustrate any coup.

V V V IMPORTANT United Press message from London about the proposed evacuation of Persia is good in that it shows us as eager to begin and the Russians as unresponsive. It is however damaging to us in that it attributes our eagerness solely to the fear of Russian penetration into the region of 'British interests in Central and Southern Persia'. This unfortunately fits in neatly with the allegations of the pro-Russian press that we are up to some nefarious game in Central and Southern Persia from which only anti-imperialists viz Russia and Tudeh can save Persia. It would help if some other agency or some news paper could refer to the unhealthy political state of a small country with three foreign even if friendly armies on her territory for several years, to the lack or all news from Persia except from Soviet sources, to rumours of the serious limitations placed on Persian sovereignty in the North and so on. There would be no harm in mentioning a point which might not occur to an American correspondent namely Great Britain 1 s permanent interest in the independence and integrity of Persia.

Taqizadeh said that he had hoped to be able to see the Secretary of State but had not been able to do so owing to Mr* Eden f s illness and then his departure for Potsdam. He had wished to tell Mr. Eden of the apprehensions felt by his Government over the violent Russian press campaign being carried out with regard to his country. He had had reports from Tehran and was satis fied that nothing had occurred which could justify this campaign. It must, therefore, be regarded as coming out of the blue, and as its object must remain obscure, since there were no grounds on which it could be justified, it was naturally all the more a cause of uneasiness. His Excellency had understood from Sir A. Gadogan the last time he had seen him that Persia was to figure on the agenda of the meeting at Potsdam. He hoped, therefore that something might there occur which would ameliorate the tense situation. Sir R. Campbell said, for his own information, that His Majesty*s Government hoped that progress might be made in connexion with Persian matters. 2* Sir R. Campbell took the opportunity to refer to the fact reported in Tehran telegram Nq a 20 Saving that no sooner had the Persian Southern Railway been taken over by the Minister of Com munications than he had ordered the reinstatement of fifty-one vj Persians arrested at the request of the Allies in 1943 on suspicion of. implication in acts of sabotage.

Campbell urged that this sort of action was most injudicious, particularly at this moment, since it raus'c cause doubt as to the use the Persian Government would make of their power as they regained it, and such doubt was particularly inopportune when the Persian Govern ment had suggested the withdrawal of Allied troops before the date provided in the Treaty. Sir R. Campbell suggested that the ambassador could usefully inform his Government that the impression given by the re-instatement of the saboteurs was not good and advise them against mis-use of regained power.

As regards recent papers, please see also the Viceroy’s telegram 74.3, the Government of India’s tele gram of the 1st June and Sir 0.

No one would, of course, dispute the fact that Russia has interfered in the internal affairs of Persia in a way that can only be described as monstrous, with the result that Persian administration has now been reduced to a state that borders on the chaotic. Russia’s object dji so doing is doubtless to weaken the administration as much as possible in order that Persia will be less than ever able to resist Russian influence and pressure whenever • she choses to exert it to her own ends. Squally, it is coAftion ground between India and H.M.G. the main object of British policy towards Persia should be to strengthen the authority of the Persian Government so far as possible in order that it may be able to resist Russian influence and maintain a properly independ ent position. To this end. Sir Reader Bullard has con- osistently advocate d a policy of the mijiimum British inter- reronce in Persia^ both in order to strengthen the Persian Government and give the Russians the least possible justifica tion to intervene further. We have also -encouraged the Persian Government to employ American advisers to this end, though it must be admitted that they have achieved very little.(jiz „ . —1 ( The Garlander-in+€hief ’s Note advocates a N-rrn rf policy in Persia which, I take it, means a policy of asserting British ^ interests on the spot/, and making direct and-forceful ’• representations to the Soviet Government direct .as the occasion arises. This is an essentially different policy from that now being pursued by H.M.G., and it seems to me highly doubtful whether it is the one best calculated to secure those^oSjectl&amp;which both H.M.G. and the Government of India desire. Russia has much better opportunities for asserting herself in Persia than we have, and it seems doubtful whether mere representations are ever likely to have the leant •Affect on the Soviet Government beyond exacerbating our relations with them. One sympathises of course with the Commander-in-Chief's plea that India is the part of the Empire most closely affected by the dangers resulting from Russian predominance in Persia, but a threat by Russia to India is after all a threat to the Commonwealth as^ a whole, and India f s best defence may lie in this, fa £*&lt;Aa , l* t+ifr Av* Pi (+ A h u F ^ / A sl*s^**j (bo* £aaC?\ u4y ^ ^ . . / : /wZvJ .

G.’s interests in keeping the Russians out of Persia coincide with those of India, and I think that para. 6 of the C-in-C's note does less than justice to British polic 3 r in Persia. As Mr. Harrison points out, the fact of the matter is that Russia has much better opportunities for asserting herself in Persia than we have. The question is how to prevent her from doing so. Surely it would be sinply o ploy into Russian hands for us to throw our weight about ^.n Persia in the manner which the paper appears to suggest. H.M,G.'s policy is not one of appeasement but one of giving the Russians no excuse to extend their influence in Persia. Para, 11 of the C-in-C’s note recommends to adopt a firm policy.

I enclose a copy of a paper I have received from the Commander- in- Chief on the military implica tions of the Russian attitude in Persia. I shall be obliged if you will continue to press upon the Foreign Office India’s interest in Persian affairs, and her apprehension of Russian policy. The Right Honourable L.S. Amery, M.PMILIliEL A. TOP. SECRET &gt; RUSSIAN 1. India's interests in Persia depend upon the position which Persia occupies as a buffer state, as a source of oil and as a vital link m India's communications with the west. 2. The present situation in Persia and the location of British and Russian forces in certain areas are governed by the Treaty of Alliance of 29 Jan 1942 between Persia. Ruseia and Great Britain. By this treaty it was provided that the Allied Powers should maintain in Persia such forces as they considered necessary, but that these forces should be withdrawn not later than six months after the end of the war with Japan. 3. Russia has taken the opportunity offered by this military occupation to introduce and establish strong political and economic interests. Acting through the Tudeh or Labour Party. Russia has steadily increased her pressure upon the Persian Govt, despite the rebuff when the latter refused the Russian application for oil concessions. Russian interference in local politics has been active and blatant. Russian nationals have been imported in the guise of specialist advisers, and Russian survey parties have been seen throughout KHORASAN. 4. It is evident that Russia seeks to obtain political and economic control of Persia to an extent which would reduce her to little more than an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union. 5. India's interests require a free, stable and independent Persia. Russian policy directly threatens those interests since, if it succeeds. Persia would to all intents and purposes be absorbed into the USSR. Her function as a buffer state to India would then cease and she would become a potential base from which Russia could mount an attack upon India. Russia would menace the air route by which India might expect reinforcements of aircraft and personnel to arrive from the Middle East, and, furthermore, by establishing submarine bases in the Persian Gulf Russia could threaten Indians sea communications. Finally, India might be deprived cf Persian oil without which her normal industrial development might be seriously retarded and without which she would be incapable of waging a major war. 6. Up to date. British policy in Persia appears to have been one of appeasement. In Nov 1944 the Govt, of India suggested to HMG that the Indian Long Range Squadron, which was responsible for showing the flag in E. Persia, might be reinforced and its activities extended in order to counteract the expansion of Russian influence there. This suggestion was not approved by HMG who considered that the Squadron should not be reinforced, and that there should be no extension of its activities in E.Persia. 7. There has been no reported instance of any direct attempt by HMG to curb Russian intervention in Persian politics nor to point out to Russia that her action violates the 1942 Treaty by which the Allied Powers undertook to respect the territorial xx&lt; integrity, the sovereignty, and the political independence of Persia. The aim of HMG is apparently to avoid any dispute with * Russia over the major issues m Persia. 8. The present policy of HMG may accord with British interests, but in no respect does it serve the interests of India. Russia is endeavouring to establish a lasting hegemony in Persia. She will seek to achieve this before the time arrives for her to meet her treaty obligations and withdraw her troops from Persia. Russian interference and infiltration into Persia is therefore likely to be intensified in the future.2 . ■ 1 9. From India’s point of view serious military implications attend a continuance^of the present situation in Persia, Russia 13 x * °nly power which is likely to threaten India during the next lo-20 years, and Persia under Russian control would constitute a direct threat to the security of India, for the value to India of a buffer state would then be removed. Persia developed by the Russians in their own time as an offensive base, and as this process continued, India would be iOrced, step by step, to build up her sea, land and air forces and to maintain them at an ever increasing degree of readiness. No estimate can be readily made of the expenditure upon armed forces that would be required to meet such a situation. That bQ V0r y heavy there can be # no doubt. It is also clear that for many years to come India will not be in a position to bear such a burden alone, and that HMl would be required to make substantial and growing contributions in men, money and material for the defence of India. 10. If Persia should fall under Russian domination, the effect upon Afghanistan would certainly be disadvantageous to Afghanistan would then be hemmed about with strong Russian influence from the Pamirs in the north to the Baluchistan Border in the south, and she would find it hard to develop her present markedly friendly attitude towards us. This in turn would impose upon India the need for extending her defensive arrangements to cover a Russian advance through Afghanistan, and especially over the route Herat - Farah - Kandahar. 11.. From a military point of view therefore the present PJ^-icy of HM1 in Persia calls for immediate reconsideration. If the security of India is to be effectively safeguarded, a strong, vigorous and resolute policy aimed at the neutralisa- tion of Russian.influence in Persia must be adopted without delay. The longer Russian influence is allowed to spread unchecked, the less chance there is of the Persian Govt, being able to find its feet and # make the country stable and indeoendent. Unless a firm policy is adopted, we are left with the prospect of progressive deterioration in the situation in Persia and very grave dangers to the future safety of India. 1 B.• ,3 7 £ 7 FILE COPY COPY ^ Jl 1 *J I XTOAKD TSL3GRAM A llotted, t o External b eparf^ ^. ^ -. es Circulated. ..J 5J3356 — C YPHER TELEGRAM ( Q * T * P» ) ^ * - r-v&gt;om GJovernmant of India,, External Affairs Dept.

I have consulted the Viceroy and he thinks that in face of Bullard’s attitude it is not worth while to write to him again. What we had felt was that if the publicity weapon against the Soviet Government is a strong one the right tactic would be first to force the Russians into the open by telling them very plainly that we saw no reason for Allied troops to remain in Tehran and then asking them to tell us for their part whether they propose to remain there, and if so why . After we have got an answer it is conceivable that it might be good policy to express disagreement with their reasons and say that we shall tell the world so and are going to withdraw our own troops. 2. The Viceroy has just sent to the Secretary of State an important General Staff paper, which reached us on the 3rd July, emphasising that a policy of appeasement in Persia vis a vis Russia may suit H.M.G. in some respects but does not suit India and that there is need for a review of policy in this matter. Persia of course looms very large to us here and we have referred to it in paras. 16-21 and 53 of the first part of the printed collection of papers sent to you (with my letter No.RB/ 589 of the 22nd June, and also at some lergth »in the E.A.D. memorandum sent to Peel with my letter No.RB/l?

Sir Reader Bullard, H.^’s Ambassador, Tehran, to Sir Olaf Caroe, Secretary, External Affairs Department, Govt, of India, New Delhi. Thank you for your letter Top Secret and Personal No.325/^ dated June 16th about the withdrawal of British troops. I have just returned from a visit to Meshed and I am more deeply jnvinced than ever that if the Russians say they propose to stay where they are in Persia until the date fixed by the Treaty, we should nevertheless evacuate Tehran forthwith - and let the world know. Either the Russians would be forced to follow suit, or else it would be clear to the world that they were staying here for objects unconnected with the defeat of the Axis. What they want, as is well known, is to rig the next elections* Nothing can prevent this but publicity, especially publicity in America, where people have no inhibitions. Trieste, the veto and the Polish Government are not my affair, but it seems to me, as a spectator, that the degree of success that the Anglo-American contentions have attained is largely due to the fact that the search light of the press, especially the American press, has been thrown on them. From my acquaintance with the Russians I am certain that there are only two things that can make the Russians behave decently, or, rather, do things that they would not have done out of decency because decency is not one of the motives that moves them in foreign politics: one is to withhold something that they want unless they give you something that you want (this is very effective, but unfortunately we rarely find ourselves with such a card in our hands); the other is to let the world knew exactly what they are up to : the contrast between their professions and their acts is often so striking that they prefer to withdraw than be shown up* It is relevant to remind you that I served in Soviet Russia for nearly four years, and that I have worked in close contact with the Soviet authorities in this country for nearly four years. Of course publicity harmful to the Russians in Persia does not depend only on the evacuation of Tehran. I am trying to get a British j journalist up here to wander about Isfahan and make the Russians tnere a little uneasy; and at the same time I have been suggesting to the new American Ambassador, Wallace Murray, that a visit to Persia by some American journalists might do much good. In point of fact I found Murray a convinced believer in the power of publicity to control the Russians: he has just come from America, where he has seen the effect under his eyes. He is debating whether a group of American, journalists could not be invited to visit Persia to return the visit of four Persian journalists to the United States. I hope this may come off, ignorant and ingenuous as so many American journalists are.

Last night several grenades, one of which exoloded, are said to have been thrown at the house of Dr. Keshavarz, one of the leading Tudeh deputies. 2. Tehran is living in a state of deep anxiety awaiting the next move of the Russians especiall; since the news of the Russian demands on Turkey and all the inhabitants except presumably Tudeh want the Russian to remove their troops and are anxious not to give them any pretext for remaining in the country. In these circumstances it is difficult to believe that the grenades with one convincing explosion between them.were thrown by an opponent of Dr. Keshavarz. No moment is so convenient from the Tudeh point of view. The exulosion might be expected to prove that the dangers depicted by Fravda only two days ago are real. Finally the Soviet Trade Union delegation are in Tehran at the moment when the outrage is committed and can see for themselves under what a reign of terror freedom loving people live in Persia.

IMBDI^TE There are many signs that Russians are making a tremendous effort to obtain virtual mastery over this country before the moment of evacuation arrives. t 2 . Violent article in Pravda mentioned in mv telegram a No. 689 suggests that action is being justified before the event ^ |?y manufacture of evidence which, as the Russians are well aware, no one on the other side can expose for lack of means of pub- ■* i; lie it y*- * : J . 3. Efforts of Tudeh backed by Russians to stir up industrial unrest are now to be backed pov/erfully bv strong.Russian Trades Union Delegation which has arrived in Tehran and is already holding out to Persian Trade Unionists the hope of a seat and a vote on Paris Trades Union International. Delegates are beginning tour with Isfahan, where the chief opponent of Yudeh was recently murdered in the street end where Persian author ities are already much too terrified of the Russians to pursue enquiry into the murder seriously. ■ 4. There is ne doubt that in parts of Northern Kurdistan to which Russians do not allow Persia to send troops, Kurdish independence movement is being .encouraged. 5. Tudeh emissaries are working hard in the villages in the north and northwest often, if ..not always, urging non payment of rent, and opposition to them is paralysed by fear. I am* obliged to accept at least in part evidence that if emissaries are not actually accompanied by Red Army soldiers, such soldiers often happen to be.m the vicinity at the critical moment.. 6. Local officials in the north have no control whatsoever over 'Tudeh. I have as yet no confirmation of recent reports that Tudeh are forming Soviets in Resht, Tobriz and elsewhere /inM 4 % - 2 - /(2) in the north but their complete indepenclence of control is by the fact, witnessed recently by.our Press Attach^ in more than one place in the north, that Tudeh agents wearing arm bands setting out their functions search all vehicles leaving for the south and confiscate all rice found in. them. Excuse given is that rice is being exported but if the Russians had managed to induce Millspaugh to agree to another Russian barter scheme it is unlikely that Tudeh would have stopped export of rice to Russia, ' ‘ 7. The Russians are using Radio Tehran for violent political propaganda. One recent broadcast was against Fascists in United States. Another comprised items on British elections (objective but not their business)' one item against anti-Soviet influences in various countries, violent attack on Swedish Government and highly critical items about the Doepitz Government. 8. Newspapers'Closely associated with Russians have appeared more openly anti-British. : 'Restakhizi-Iran' published a series of scurrilous articles accusing the British of having murdered Middle East statesmen including Faisal end engineered not only murder of the United States Consul who was lynched by a fanatical crowd in Tehran twenty years ago but also execution of Persian pilgrim who was put to death in Mecca in 1943 on a charge of sacrilege. (It was with the greatest difficulty that I secured suspension of this paper though Persian authorities sus pended at once on demand of Soviet Embassy a paper which had published serious article questioning the claim of Russia to be any sort of democracy). Even Rahbar which is regarded as direct voice of the Soviet Embassy alleged that when three British officials were touring in Bakhtiari country recently they planned to have Tudeh headquarters in Shiraz-burnt. It has now referred to a tale published by another pro-Russian newspaper that during his recent visit General Paget had a secret meeting with Saed Zla and in an article studded with ironical notes of exclamation has expressed hope that General Paget did not come here as he went to Syria 'merely to restore order'.' 9. It seems improbable that the Russians will try to bring off some violent coup, though in the absence of publicity even this cannot be entirely excluded. Most probable explanation is that they are determined to force upon the electors so many of their candidates that even if Tudeh has-not a majority in the Majlis it will in fact be &gt; a hie- to run- it* 10. No one could blame'the Persian Government.if they refused to hold elections until after the withdrawal of.foreign troops but in that case the Russians would almost certainly cause elections to be held for Soviet or provincial councils in the north. Possible remedies are (1) visit of a party of journalists who would be able and not afraid to publish their views and in view of servile attitude of English press towards Russia as reported in a recent Foreign Office telegram, they must be American or*&lt;• 3 ** &lt; (2) admission of foreign observers to all parts of Persia at the time of the elections (in view of our policy in Greece suggestion to this effect would not be unreasonable). 11. Withdrawal of British and Russian troops from con siderable area of Persia would, of course, have an excellent effect. Even withdrawal from Tehran alone would put heart into the Government and administration. And I again repeat my conviction that if the Russians refuse to evacuate even Tehran it would pay us to leave the city immediately. Apart from the effect on Persia this would make it extremely difficult for the Russians to convince the world of the genuineness of the elections resulting in their favour in areas dominated by their troops.

As Persian Gulf Command is handing railv/ay over to Persian Government by July 1st and despatch of oil supplies to Russia across Persia ceases from June 1st question of the v/ithdrawal of British troops is very urgent. 2. In making some allowance for delay in withdrawal from Tehran I assumed that at most a few guards would remain to protect assets. General Officer Commanding Persian Area hov/ever appears to contemplate retention of his Headquarters in Tehran for disposal of^assets. There would appear to be no military reason against evacuation of Tehran as soon as physically possible after June 30th and I cannot think that if the evacuation Y/ere politically desirable (as I think it is) merely the business'of disposing of assets would be allowed to delay evacuation and thereby deprive us of anv argument to induce the Russians to withdraw from the capital. Retention of Headquarters lor the purpose^ of disposals would moreover make a farce of the statement which I made to Persian Government in your name that His Majesty s Government were prepared to consider the possibility of withdrawal before the time fixed in the Treaty should military authorities wish [gro.undec] to remove British troops from the vicinity of railv/ay north of Anduneshk and question whether they should go to Hamadan therefore calling for immediate decision. ^ I am aware that only in Hamadan are there quarters ready for these troops but as to the use of town so far forward as Kamadan as a station for a larger body of troops than was ever posted there before would be an invitation to the Russians not to reduce but even to enlarge the area they occupy I suggest most careful consideration should be given to proposal made before the move is sanctioned.

Head of Soviet hospital here, who obviously has a role additional to his medical functions, recently returned from Moscow and informed a Persian general that the Soviet authorities had decreed a new line of non-intervention in Persian internal affairs pending their establishment of a dominating position in the world of politics, which would enable them to do as they liked in Persia. Soviet troops would leave Persia in the veiy near future. 2. The value of this statement is difficult to assess. Soviet censorship continues to suppress messages from press correspondents describing popular'agitation for Allied evacuation and Soviet Ambassador in conversation with diplomatic neutrals, has been taking the line that official Persian request for evacuation is an impertinence. On the other hand x*y a) Russian proposal for the release of all internees ( my telegram No. 498L d) evidence of relaxed control on the road to and along Caspian coast c) considerable easing of Russian censorship of incoming matter.

T T T T T IMPORTANT TOP SECRET My immediately preceding telegram. On cessation of Persian oil supplies to Russia (date of which has now been I understand advanced from July 1st to June 1st) and provided that if Russia joins the war with Japan she can be supplied with oil from other sources, G-. 0.0. sees no military objection to withdrawal of British troops from Tehran* Completion of withdrawal would of course depend to some extent on disposal of capital assets. 2* Persian official request (my telegram No. i-91) for Allied withdrawal will presumably necessitate renewed consultations or attempted consultations with the Soviet Government. In that case a pari-passu evacuation of Tehran only could at least be proposed, and this would be better than nothing from the point of view of Persian public opinion. But if for reasons of health British summer camps must be maintained I see no prospect of inducing the Russians to withdraw from Meshed (though Meshed town is outside the international zone as originally defined) still less from Kasvin, which is occupation zone and of great psychological importance because it dominates communications westward from the capital. British withdrawal from Tehran would not mean withdrawal to our original zone since (a) summer camp at Bisitun is twenty miles outside it and (b) G.O.C. contemplates stationing ’’ railway brigade M at (j Hamadan as soon as railway is handed back zo theTersians. tug Russians could therefore plausibly argue that their with drawal from Tehran was the most that could be demanded of them on basis of reciprocity [gp. undeo.] If, when approaching the Russians afresh, we admitted that for the defence of the oil area we needed to keep troops in Persia - and preferably in an area at least as large as our original zone - there is serious /riskt - 2 - &lt;% nsk^of their pretending to the Persians that our insistence on remaining v;as all that prevented them (since they could not leave . . '^ le merc y imperialistic armies) from themselves v/ithdra'ving altogether from the country. Russian-in spired press is already beginning to take this line, though for lack oi any basis of truth it has yet to convince Persian opinion as a whole. , I suggest therefore for consideration that it would be tactically preferable.to make renewed approach in the form of a ooiu proposal for ,pari-passu evacuation of Tehran alone n as a If the Russians accept, we shall reap minor political advantages (particularly in view of the forthcoming elections) and shall nave gained a breathing space. If on the contrary they maintain their Yalta attitude of refusal to discuss with drawal at all, tv/o forms of defence are open to us: (1) to give unofficial but 'widespread publicity in Persia to this refusal and (2) to withdraw independently from Tehran. 4. As regards (2) I am aware from your telegram No. 8 that m January riis majesty s G-overnment were not in favour of even a partial ”[grp. undec. ? un]compensated' withdrawal. I urge / however that so far as Tehrai alone is [grp. undec. ? concerned] / ^ tnis should now be reconsidered. The Russians could stay on in the capital after we had left without very serious consequences ^ to their publicity. If (which I doubt) tney 'were prepared to face these consequences, and stay on, our withdrawal would, in facilitate their resort to strong arm method in connexion with the elections. I [grp. undec. ? realise] however our presence here has not prevented their using such methods (e.g. during the oil crisis). 5. As regards our attitude towards the Persian request, it is clearly necessary to inform the Persian authorities that they are incorrect in assuming that their country is of no interest from the point of view or the prosecution or the war with Japan (in which they are theoretically engaged as our ally) and that on the contrary not only must the oil area by protected but an air base in the south is essential. They cannot logically object to the^use of such bases by ourselves and the Americans, though they will doubtless contend that they are in a position to defend therewith their own forces* We, for our part,'cannot hope to convince them that the stationing of British troops as far afield as Kermanshah is essential for the security of these bases: but if we gain a breathing space by withdrawal (with or without the Russians) from Tehran, it is to be hoped this will last the summer when we shall need to use summer leave camp at Karind and summer camp for mobile reserves at Kermanshar and that by the summer of 1946 if the war continues we shall have been able to find stations outside Persia. Meanwhile if by this autumn all British tro#ps could be withdrawn from the plateau to Andimishk, their presence there in the immediate vicinity of our vital war interest would at least become easier to justify. As an additional pledge of our good faith. I suggest that an attempt be made to negotiate a new tripartite agreement with the Persians /andand Americans providing for sonie form of joint military defence of air base and 'adjacent area' (nrhich would include the oilfields). Such a agreement would help to disprove the inevitable Russian propaganda to the effect that we were remaining in the south for ulterior motives® Persian co operation in the defence could be of theoretical sort and need not worry either British or American military authorities, but it would go far towards saving Persian face. The Persian Government have so far ignored the overtures for treaty regularisation of the presence of American troops in the country, but their attitude would, I think, be different if it were a case of obtaining what would amount to an American guarantee of our honest intentions (agreement could stipulate that both we and the Americans would withdraw together not later than the date of the armistice with Japan) and hence a means of refuting Russian excuses for staying on. Foreign Office please pass to Government of India as my telegram No. 127. [Copies sent to Telegraph Branch India Office for repetition to Government of India]. O.T.P.ft HHHHf SECRET, WITHDRAWAL OP BRITISH TROOPS FROvI PERSIA. My own view, which is perhaps out of date since it is based on a study of the problem and discussion with Russians on the spot nearly three years ago, is that the Russians, in order to keep on good terms with the Persians, would withdraw from Persia altogether if we did the same. This does not mean that, having once withdrawn, they would not stage a comeback on the slightest pretext - and they would have little difficulty in engineering such a pretext, I feel, however, that we could probably find a pretext just as easily. 2. It always seems to be taken by us as axiomatic that we must maintain troops for the protection of the oil areas. So long as we were at war with G-ermany and there were Carman agents around (and even inside *,) the oilfields areas, our need for troops for their protection was very real . Under present conditions, I doubt whether it i§ so in the case of the KHANAQIN oilfields and the KERMANSHAH refinery. Those fields yield a negligible quantity of oil in comparison with the KIRKUK fields; the majority (so far as I remember) of the wells lie in Iraq where we can protect them with troops if we want to do so; the wells, which lie some hundreds of yards away across the frontier, supply KERMANSHAH and S.W. Persia, and the Persians would be most unlikely to sabotage them or the KERMANSHAH refinery. 3. For the above reasons, I doubt the necessity, for the purpose of oilfields protection, of maintaining any troops at all on the KHANAQIN - KERMANSHAH - RAMADAN line; and it is our maintenance of troops on the HAMADAN and KEHMAHSHAH plateaux which offends Persian susceptibilities so deeply. The location of a brigade at HAMADAN (a delightful place) is, to my mind, justified only as a political counter to the continued occupation by the Russians of KASVTN. A. AS regards the KHUZESTAN oilfields, the position is different. For many years prior to 1939 we had no troops (except Assyrian levies) within at least ten days call of the Fields; but since the winter 1940/M &gt; the produce of those fields has been so essential to our war effort in the East that we have dared to take no risk. So we have kept troops there, though only a handful. The risk is now much less, but it still exists. So troops must remain available to prevent wholesale sabotage. Troops cannot possibly prevent minor sabotage *. Hence, I am not sure that it would not be good enough if they were stationed over the border in Iraq. ANDUHSHK (one of the hottest places in the world), which is suggested as a site for the location of troops for the protection of the KHUSESTAN fields, was selected as a defensive position against the contingency of a German advance down the road from KHURRUMABAD to AB'/AZ • It would be unsuitable as a site for troops whose duty it was to protect the fields against sabotage or tribal attack. 3. My own inclination would be •- —^ (a) To withdraw altogether from Tehran if the Russians did likewise. I feel that it would be a mistake for us to make a unilateral withdrawal of troops from the capital. (b) To withdraw from (i) HAMADAN (ii) KERMANSHAH and (iii) KARIND, successively, as the Russians withdrew from (i) KASVIN (ii) TABRIJ^/ PAHLEVT and (iii) over the Qxus, I place no value on hill stations at KARIND or KEHMANSHAH/BISITUN, There are places just as suitable in KURDISTAN. (c) Withdraw troops from KHUZESTAN if the Russians agree to withdraw from Persia entirely. In their place, organise a gendarmerie of sorts, supported by a mobile striking force (including gun boats) over the international frontier in Iraq. /I feel— I feel strongly, however, that for the sake of maintaining our prestige and influence in Persia, although NOT for the purpose of protecting the oilfields, it would be a mistake to withdraw our troops southwards unless /the Russians actually made.(as distinct from agreeing to make) a simultaneous withdrawal North-Westwards* &lt; « &lt; 5 ' j - ' ■&gt;: It&amp;' pile [This telegram.is of particular secrecy and should be retained oy the authorised recipient and not passed on. ] [CYPHER] FROM TEHRifl TO FOREIGN OFFICE.

For reasons, given in my telegram No. 80 I am convinced that retention of these camps oh any basis would render it impossible to secure a substantial Russian withdrawal, 2. Proposal of War Office to treat question of Kermanshah camp as a separate issue, and that of G.O.C* to maintain the camp but say nothing about this to the Russians when discussing withdrawal, are in my view useless. Neither from Persian nor Russian point of view does it matter at all v/hat the camps are called: Persians are interested only in a genuine and complete withdrawal of Allied troops from as large an area as possible, and the Russians would certainly use our retention of the camps as a pretext for maintaining (or restoring - with protests at our dis-ingenifousness and much local anti-British propaganda) troop centres in greater part of the area they largely control. 3. It seems, therefore, that as long as we retain troops for guarding oil area, there is no hope of saving Persians from cumulative and already disastrous effects of Russian H occupation”. If, however, Russians do remain till the end of the war with Japan, I must emphasise, at the risk of being thought alarmist, that most probable result will be complete disintegration of Persian Government's authority; and this would incidentally confront us with very serious possibility of our losing the use of oil-fields for good and all. , - 1 4. I realise of course that in view of the risk of Japanese sabotage (with or without help of tribal disturbances) there is everything to be said, from strictly military point of view, for retaining troops in South Persia; but I would urge these immediate military risks should be carefully weighed against ultimately far greater political danger referred to above. Military risks, though not negligible, are much less serious than those confronting us during period before we sent troops into Persia; when the Germans were far closer than the Japanese are now, and maintained dangerous agents in all adjacent territories, including tribal districts of South Persia itself, \ —* €o^juoK tb l^.D. •‘*- 54 10 ’• ,D1A UrFlCly 5 0 Might not a possible solution be an attempt to create some sort of special police force for oil area on lines oi Palestine Police ana theoretically under Persian control: For dealing with ordinary sabotage activities - a comparatively small police force (assisted by normal Persian police find troops) would presumably be adequate, i*or dealing wdth’tpi^bal^ disturbances, British troops could still be kept available in adjacent Iraqi territory, and it would of course, have to be understood by Persian Government, teat such troops would be sent back to Persia without nesitavion if, as a result of Persian mismanagement, any sufficiently serious tribal threat to the oil-fields arose. 60 Persian Government would not relish the presence of an extraneous' police force in their territory.

I acknowledge receipt of a letter from your Secretary of State to the Foreign Secretary, dated 16th January, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Viceroy of India. F.F. Turnbull, Esq.., India Office.Peel Mr. I agree vd.th your draft except for two small points. In two places for ’’area' read ’’areas''. We should presumably have to keep, or retain the right to keep, troops at the Khanaqin as well as the Aba-dan oilfields. Secondly, I see that the War Office have ruled out Kermanshah as a semi-permanent camp.* I cannot think why. It is an excellent site. I would therefore omit the last sentence of your telegram. Alt hough it would, in m y opinion, be the greatest mistake to witndraw our troops^(the symbol of British influence) before the Russians withdraw theirs, I don't think you really need stress that point in your telegram. If you think otherwise, it would perhaps do if the words ’’Tehran in particular' were inserted in the fifth line after the word 'Persia'. —T A. C ^ Sy^.l'eUL ua ■ '»f'«vAV 20.1.45.t|-».

FFFFF ■ • IMPORTANT. Viceroy's telegram No. 1300 to Secretary of State for India. Premature withdrawal of troops would by definition be a . mistake, and of course I did not advocate it. What I advocated was withdrawal as soon as we considered the time npe in the light of military exigencies, and I do not tnmK tnat such withdrawal would be politically premature, while morally we are committed to it. ■ 2. It isunderstood that an independent withdrawal by us - or even (see your telegram No. 8 and my telegram No. 30) mere publicity for our readiness to withdraw - would unquestionably affect Russian attitude whether or not remaining acts induce them to follow suit, at once, for it would knock the bottom out of their present propaganda on the theme ’’Imperialist designs'. If Persia is to be saved frpm her Imperialistic northern neighbour.it is of the utmost importance that we • should either engineer a Russian withdrawal soon or m default of that deflate Russian propaganda. 3. No action of ours m Persia wpuld ever be regardbd by either Persians or Russians as altruistic: we have always been - and I hope always shall be - actuated by an evident -self inteiest whiph coincides closely with that of the Persians „ themselves. But.whereas for us to remain in Persia after military need for this had obviously passed could and would be justifiably criticised as the very reverse of 4 altruism* to withdraw punctually in accordance with the spirit of our undertakings could not be regarded otherwise than as internationally scrupulous. It is on such fair dealings and not on any belief in our disinterested kindness that our ^ prestige in Persia rests; and I regard that prestige as well worth maintaining. c 4 * in Tehran area British Combat Troops are too few to be impressive and I doubt whether they -are factor of major importance in our 'direct influence on Persian affairs'. Such influence as we in fact possess is due rather to realisation that whether or not we keep a few troops in the country we are to be reckoned with as a great power. The Persian authorities are by no means always amenable to our influence whence the question whether at:any time since they became our Allies their attitude has been modified appreciably through fear of physical cnercian by British troops. 6 . Recently a number of newspapers which are not ry. \ supporters rsupporters of Russians have been demanding withdrawal of Allied troops”. On the other hand overestimated pro-Russiar^-^ papers have adopted the attitude described in my telegram No. 25 maintaining that-'withdrawal of foreign troops would merely mean abandonment of Persia'’to imperialistic policy which it is alleged ran country through Reza Shah for so long. I take this argument to mean not that the Russians would refuse to withdraw if we withdrew or offered to withdraw, but that ’ they -realise how awkward their position would be if they ' showed, intention to stay in spite, of our withdrawal or offer to withdraw. It may be that present Persian Government and perhaps majority of Persians would be much -alarmed at the prospect of an independent British withdrawal, but this seems to me an argument for our at least “going through the motions”. The publicity to which in my telegram No. 30 I suggested that we should have recourse to in default of Russian.agreement to withdraw pari passu, might well in my view take the initial form of an official hint that we were ready to withdraw (except from the oilfields area) without waiting for our . Allies to-do likewise. The Persian Government r s reaction would almost certainly be an urgent appeal for us to do nothing of the sort; and this would provide us with a most valuable card for use against our detractors. Fact that such a hint (not of course amounting to any. definite or irrevocable promise) had been made would inevitably become known to the Majlis and the press thereby ensuring a widespread and beneficial publicity not officially sponsored by us. For^my part indeed' I should like not merely to hint but to enquire formally what Persian Governments wishes were in the matter; but I realise that this would not be compatible with the views expressed in your telegram No. 8 .• 6 . When this telegram had been drafted the Shah enquired through Minister of the Court whether the Allies would not evacuate at least'Tehran seat of Government and of Parliament.

On the other hand withdrawal offers several advantages d) if we evacuate Tehran the Russians must either do the same or expose themselves as less considerate than the British (2) evacuation of Tehran alone by foreign troops would strengthen the Persian Governments (3) if touchiness of Russians is due in part to suspicion of our motives, as it probably is, an offer on our part to evacuate Tehran and perhaps other places, might help to calm them down, even if at first they did attribute the offer to a wish to remove Russian influence * from the capital* 2.

Repeated to Government of India, Saving to Paiforce. 5 5 5 IMPORTANT. TOP SECRET. - M y telegram No. 1524-not repeated to Government of India. Military Attach^ at His Majesty's Embassy has drawn my attention to another matter which may well have excited Soviet suspicion as to our motives viz: continuation of work on airfields in East Persia long after they could have been required for use against possible German invasion of Persia. Mirjawa and Zahidan airfields are finished but *work* still goes on at Kerman and the road from Zahidan to Kerman is being maintained at great cost as a service road. The explanation given to His Majesty’s Embassy by South-East Asia Air Command viz. ’’Airfields originally provided for tactical use against German threat *but will* now be available as cpmmunication airfields for most direct air route to the middle of Europe” might not reassure the Soviet Government. The Soviet Military Attachd recently visited *Kerman and* Zahidan and I take it for granted that these airfields were among the *chief objects of interest* to him. 2, Cases are not lacking where actions which seemed innocent enough to the doers aroused profound suspicion in the Soviet mind. e.g. attempts made by various officers and parties in the first year of occupation to enter into the Soviet ’’Zone” to make surveys or reconnaissances. Moreover as you are aware inspired defenders of the Soviet Government's demand for an oil concession represent it as prompted by manoeuvres of capitalist concession hunters in Persia. However mistaken and even dishonest the Soviet accusations in such matters may be, we should I suggest, consider seriously all possible causes of suspicion with a view to their elimination or diminution wherever possible.

I am arranging for the question of future use of # the Persian corridor, as supply route to Russia to be examined as soon as possible by the Allied Supplies Executive. The object is to determine how soon this route can be closed down without detriment to Allied war effort and Executive are being asked to take into account possibility of diversion of traffic to other routes, Youwill, however, appreciate that question is not simple, involving as it does such factors as ability (not yet confirmed) of Black Sea ports to handle cargo now sent via Persian Gulf 5 possibility of supplying Russia with petroleum products from some other source than Abadan: and possible diversions of cargo from Far East to Persian Gulf in the event of Russia's entering into war against Japan. 2 .

Although the saving clause is a little ominous it looks from here as though the Soviet Government have at last persuaded the Persian Prime Minister to negotiate on their own terms, i 0 e e before the final with drawal, unless the Soviet action is simply the result of the firm attitude of United States Government and His Majesty's Government. 2. pravda also publishes this morning a short Tehran Tass message dated March 23rd summarising the jtersian Prime Minister's press interview in the course ol which he is reported to have said that the most important question was the evacuation of Soviet troops from Persia, that all other problems depended upon this, and that the Azerbaijan questionf - 2 - question which was of comparatively minor importance could be solved by negotiation as soon as agreement had been reached on the evacuation of Soviet troops. He is also reported as % criticising the Persian Ambassador in Washington, and as saying that it did not matter whether the Security Council met to-day or a fortnight later and that, if the evacuation of Soviet troops and other questions were not settled earlier, the Persian question would be on the agenda. He also denied reports that more Soviet troops had arrived since Harch 2nd. 3. rravda also carries another Tass message from Tehran of same date reporting the rersian Prime minister’s statement that Sayyid 2»ia had been arrested not under outside pressure but because his subversive activities threatened Persian internal security. P. Molotov should now be in a position to fulfil his * undertaking to reply to your enquiry (my telegram No. 1120) 5 although it has happened in the past that the Soviet Govern ment regard Tass communiques as sufficient reply on awkward issues.

URGENT, Addressed to Tehran No. 46 Repeated to Government of India and Zahidan No. 58. My telegram No. 41 of March 8th. About 15 Russian military trucks each containing about 25 soldiers and some towing field guns left Meshed this morning at dawn. - The wing of Shah Reza hospital and military offices which were occupied by Russian military on their arrival at Meshed have been handed over ro Persian authorities. With the exception of two blocks the military barracks have been handed over. Some time before handing over, all furniture and equipment of wing of Shah Reza hospital were removed by the Russians. The Military Headquarters Offices which were completely furnished when the Russians took them over have been completely stripped of all furniture and carpets. The military barracks have not only been stripped of all furniture and equipment but doors and windows have been removed, I am informed that all this has been sold in the bazaar and some of it lias been retrieved by Persian authorities by purchasing it from those who bought it from the Russians. There is no doubt that anything saleable has been removed \ -Dby tho Ruosians from buildings which they occupied as only m^ans of obtaining Persian currency with which to buy food, Swiss watches and luxury goods to take back to Russia for their families. There are plenty of such goods still obtain able in Meshed. The withdrawal of Russian troops from Meshed is not yet complete and they are still in control of telegraph lines to Kuehan and beyond.[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should 'be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] [CYPHER] CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM WAS HING TON TO FOREIGN O FFICE Earl of Halifax D. 12.44 a.m. 21st March, 1946. 20th March, 1946. R. 6.55 a.m. 21st March, 1946. Repeated to Tehran * Moscow sssss I MMEDIAT E Your telegram No. 3 to New York, Perpetual tactics of Soviet champions in this country are to play up confusion of the reports from Persia with the implication that most of them are exaggerated and many untrue. 2. Thus apparent conflict 'between the State Department’s information on troop movements and the statement attributed by e.g. New York Herald Tribune of March 16th to Foreign Office officials that as far as their information went there had been no increase in the number of Soviet troops in Persia from London plus United Press story 15 that th* Rri+ns^ source took a less serious view of the situation than the United States officials, has been used to support the thesis that the Soviet troops are probably not sufficient to cause serious concern. 3* State Department consider that their information about the Soviet troop movements is more than borne cut by reports of His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz. / 4 .9 _ 4c In general those who wish to appease the Soviet Government at the expense if need he of the United Nations Organisation charter are trying to produce red herring to conceal the fact that Russia has broken her treaty with Persia 0 One theory being widely spread is that the Sevier Government only wants oil concessions to which she has as good a right as any other country 3 Those who maintain this add that Britain obtained concessions by pressure of her own powerful interests and that what we see now is a struggle of big business interests versus natural demands of Soviet Socialist State* 5,» This particular thesis has received impetus from 'diplomatic sources in London' which are alleged to have remarked that Kis Majesty's Government were considering a discussion of oil concessions to the U.S.S.R. This has been hailed by the natural compromisers on this issue such as Swing etas an obvious way out of the present impasse by which the Soviet Government would receive all it was bargaining for c Thus the Soviet Government is represented as not basically working for territorial expansion to the Persian Gulf, nor as con templating real breach of the charter a situation which according to these compromisers the British evidently grasped better than the Americans who are preparing to defend the charter much too quixotically and if need be alone* t Lippmann’s reiterated complaints that the crisis is due as much as anything to poor diplomatic handling by State Department, are also thought to echo this attitude somewhat, / 6 0- 3 - 6 fc In the light of the above I feel that if farther press messages from London serve to confirm all their firm suspicions that support from His Majesty's Government at United Nations Organisation for a firm stand on an issue which is at least as vital to His Majesty's Government as to the United States Government is in any doubt, those here who wish to appease the Soviet Government will be encouraged and effect of State Department's lead would be weakened. You may therefore care to consider either through guidance to press or otherwise; the advisability of again making it clear in connexion with Persian issue that His Majesty's Government remain no less than the United States Government in favour of defence of the charter&lt;&gt; 7. It has been very helpful that the New York Times of March 20th carried a despatch date-lined London March 19th of which text is contained in my immediately following telegram. This has cleared the air a bit with State Department but more in the same strain would undoubtedly have a tonic effect here.

It has been reported that a large number of Russian troops that left Meshed are near the Akhlamad valley about 50 miles north west of Meshed on the Auchan road. The feeling is that they might return to Meshed at any time should the present political situation between Gr4at Britain, United States and Russia continues to deteriorate. 3. Hizb lUdeh and their newspaper Rasti continue anti-British propaganda. Since Churchill's Fulton speech it has been intensified. Violent abuse of Churchill is being broadcast by loud speakers.
