The remarks are regarding Arab tribes supporting the Turks, and further observations made by the Secretary of State for India on the Battle of Shaiba, at which it was reported that the Turkish troops had been joined by almost 10,000 Arab combatants. The letter also raises the question of why they were now siding with the Turks given their previous relations with Britain.Grey's response to these observations includes a detailed explanation of the composition of the tribes involved as being primarily from Arab communities in Iraq, and the Muntafiq [al-Muntafiq] tribe of the Euphrates and Shatt-ul-Gharaf [Shaṭṭ al-Gharrāf, also known as Shaṭṭ al-Ḥayy] regions. His response also notes that the tribes involved are not those of the Persian Gulf region as had previously been assumed by Lord Curzon.The letter goes on to explain these tribes' relations with the Turks and the reasons for their having sided with them. The letter concludes by providing information on some of the tribes of the Persian Gulf, in particular the Zaffir [al-Zafīr] who had declined Turkish invitations to take up arms; and the Yuarin, Bani Malik [Banī Mālik] and Shammar all of whom had chosen to remain neutral.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston George Nathaniel Curzon</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkey</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shatt al ʻArab</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mesopotamian Campaign (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Battle of Shaiba (1915)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000253#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
