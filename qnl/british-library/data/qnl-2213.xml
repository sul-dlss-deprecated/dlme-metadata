Dear Sirs, In continuation of my conversation with your Representative curing my recent visit to Bombay,! enclose for your information copies of correspondence which passed between this office and your Representative at Bahrain regarding the deceased Musa bin Ali. The existence of the man T s relatives were verified by the Aden Residency and it was found that a widow of his was alive. I understood from your Representative,Mr Steele, that a suitable amount would be forthcoming for payment to the widow but Mr.Jordan on taking over informed me that it would not be possible to make any payment at all. As I mentioned to your Representative at Bombay I considered that a sum of Rs.200/- toould be ample and that if anything further was heard from the widow that this amount should be paid to her. If,however,the question is not raised again by the man T s relatives (as appears probable now since the accident occurred some 18 months • A* ago) 1 444. not intend to move any further in the matter and will not ask for the payment. I would be glad if you application in due form be received within a reasonable space of time so that there may be something on my records^ fours faithfully, could see your way A to make this payment,however,should an 'olitical Agent,LAP &lt;w).
