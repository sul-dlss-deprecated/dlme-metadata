Within this there are four distinct sections in the following order: letters inward 19 November 1767-27 December 1768; letters inward December 1786-6 December 1788; letters outward 13 October 1763-27 December 1768; 20 April 1763-20 August 1767. Each section is chronological order of when the letter was received.</extent><extent>Condition: Some of the pages in the volume have been damaged by bookworm, stains, and general wear and tear which has obscured parts of the text, but generally the condition of the documents is good. There has been some recent restoration using a silk laminate and more modern paper.Foliation: The main sequence, and the one used for reference, is written in pencil in the top right corner of the recto of each folio.There are also two pagination systems, which are inconsistent. The first is written in large numbers, in pencil, in the top outside corner of each page. It appears throughout the volume but is often out of sequence. The second appears only on the later letters (those between 1786 and 1788) and seems to be original. It is written in ink on the top outside corner of each page.In addition to this, the later (1786-1788) letters are also individually numbered at the bottom of each item. This is an original numbering.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>A collection of letters sent from and received at the East India Company's Bushire Residency from the establishment of the settlement in early 1763 until late 1788.
