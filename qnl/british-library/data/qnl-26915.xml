My dear 6ir Hubert, • Please refer to your telegram i»o.5 to the United Kingdom High Commissioner, new Delhi dated the 10th September, 1949. 2. I understand from Wcods-Hallard that when His Highness the oultan reached bombay a member of the Deputy United Kingdom Hifeh Commissioner's staff called upon His Highness and invited him to lunch. As the Deputy High Commissioner did not himself call upon His Highness, His Highness did not feel inclined to accept the invitation, which otherwise ,he would have done. 3. In view of your telegram under reference it seems curious that the Deputy United Kingdom High Commissioner did not himself call upon the-Sultan. 4. I am informing you of this, for although His Highness both telegraphed from Bombay after his arrival, and informed me personally on his return here, that he enjoyed his visit through out and much appreciated all arrangements made, he appears to have seen fit to inform ftooas-Ballard about this with the intention that he should mention it to me. 5. I have taken no other action about it nor raised it with His Highness or maae any comment to Toods-Ballard, except to ask him to let me know any other remarks or descriptions of his visit, gooa or bad, which His Highness may impart, as it will be of great use to us upon future occasions, so that we may know what pleases, and what to avoid. 6. The only other thing that His Highness has so far remarked upon is the sad accident to the Pakistan airways machine in which 26 passengers including two high military officers were killed. He did not say it, but he obviously remembered that it had been suggested that he should fly from Bombay in one of these machines. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) F.C.L. Chauncy.

CULP RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 28th January, 1950. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a despatch I have received from the Political Agent, I.luscat on the subject of the visit of the Sultan to India and Pakistan. During my recent visit to Muscat I asked the Sultan whether he had had any official discussions in New Delhi or Karachi and he indicated that he had had some kind of official discussions in New Delhi, at which it was agreed that negotiations for the new Treaty between Muscat and India should be undertaken to replace the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1939 when it expires, but tiat he had had no such discussions in Karachi. He did, however, say that one or two persons had spoken to him informally about Gwadur. I hope shortly to address you separately about both the Treaty position and Gwadur. Apparently the question of consular represent ation was not raised either at New Delhi or Karachi. 2. During my visit to Muscat I had several long talks with the Sultan and found him as usual most friendly and cooperative in all matters in which there is no question of any infringement of his independence. He is on very good terms with Major Chauncy and appreciates the tact and consideration with which he is treated by him. He proposes to leave for Dhofar about the 15th February and when I pointed out to him the difficulty which might be experienced in negotiating the new Treaty while he was there he said that he expected to return to Muscat in October. I said that I thought you would be disappointed that he was not visiting the United Kingdom this year and he said that he found it necessary to go to Dhofar for this summer and that he looked forward very much to paying a visit to London at a later date. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the United Kingdom High Commissioners at New Delhi and Karachi, the British Middle East Office and the Political Agent, Muscat. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, His Majesty* s Principal Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London.COPY The British Consulate, Muscat. 7/8/27/50 January 23, 1950. Visit of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman to India and Pakistan. Sir, I have the honour to state that the Sultan of Muscat returned from India on the 16 th December, 1949. In a recent interview he indicated that he was very pleased with his visits to India and Pakistan, and the treatment accorded to him everywhere. He mentioned only that in New Delhi he was impressed by the great amount of security precautions taken in Covemment House, in contrast to the days of British Viceroys, and of Pakistan he merely appeared relieved that he had not travelled by Pakistan Airways as had been proposed by the Pakistan Government, since a machine with twenty six passengers including three high military officers (Pakistan) had crashed with all lives lost. He had made his own arrangements through Tata Company. I gathered, however, from His Minister for Foreign Affairs that he had not taken up the Treaty question but his idea is that the present Treaty shall run out, and then if Pakistan and India like they can negotiate separate Treaties and the outcome of such treaties will decide the question of representation. The Sultan will give notice to me in February 1950 that he wishes to terminate the present Treaty, will then leave it to us and India and Pakistan to make the approach for new ones. On getting our proposals he will then state his views. Apart from this I could ascertain no other result of the visits. Though complete cordiality and cooperation was the keynote, the Sultan shows no sign of any change in his firm resolve not to sell Gwadur or allow Pakistan, and therefore other warships than His Majesty* s, to visit anywhere in his territory except Muscat. In spite of past impressions, he may or may not have given, he does not wish to lease Gwadur, and he wants Pakistan to give up the Postal arrangements in Gwadur. I have noticed a definite air of determination on the part of the Sultan, supported by his Foreign Minister, since his return, to establish the complete independence of the Sultanate in fact as in name. He is most cooperative and ready to meet proposals more than half way when made with the correct approach, but anything reflecting our former relations with an Indian State, with its background of paramountcy meets with his instant opposition, and out of hand refusal. It is not difficult to avoid this, and I am in fact finding the Sultan very accessible and ruch less reserved, so long as I avoid offending his susceptibilities: he is not in the least averse to frank discussions, in fact welcomes it. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. P. C. L.
