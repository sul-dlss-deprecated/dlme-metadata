In the former case the excess was occasioned by the increased prices of drugs and medicines, the abnormal expenditure during the year on account of Establish ment charges debitable to the “ Office Allowance,” the extension of the Consulate premises at Birjand to provide accommodation for the Office as well as quarters and stables for the Escort, and by the fall in the exchange value of the rupee. Of the latter sum, Rs. 3,795-8-9 is accounted for by the grant of exchange compensation to the members of the establishment paid from Office Allowance on the basis of the sanction conveyed in your telegram, dated the 24th August 1917. The balance, Rs. 2,115-13-7, is accounted for by the increased expenditure under “ Medical Supplies” and “ Hospital Contingencies ”, and by the adverse exchange and depreciation of the purchasing power of the Kran. 2. We further take the opportunity to report that we have also sanctioned, owing to the heavy loss in exchange and increased expenditure on account of House rent” and “Establishment” an excess expenditure of Rs. 2,832-4-10 over the grant under the head (C Office Allowance of the Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz for the year 1916-17. 3.

While, owing to the continued presence of the Military in Eastern Persia, the country is now suffering little from the violence of armed gangs, the work of establishment of the Consulate and of the Vice-Consuls has increased proportionately to the increase of our military forces, particularly in con nection with the provision of Supplies and Transport ard the provision of labour for building and road-making. In these matters the Consulate ghulams who know the country and have earned our trust habitually perform services the value of which far exceeds the cost of their maintenance. I have also had experience of their usefulness as an armed guard in that they have enabled me to travel in security on occasions—inspecting boundary pillars, making enquiries regarding supplies, and w r hen wishing to travel light—when the presence^ of a considerable number of my regular escort or other troops would be incon venient. There always remains, in addition, the possibility, not negligible at a time of high prices and of unpopular activity on the part of the Revenue Department in Sistan, that their services may be required for the purpose of preventing the sanctuary of the Consulate from being abused. 3. For these reasons I have the honour to request that the temporary additional grant of R1,OOG may be continued for the year 1919-20. SGPI. Delhi—506 Finl.,—1-2-19*72.Copy.

TLu Majesty's Secretary of Stale jor India Sir, Simla, the Stk July 1918, We have the honour to refer to Lord Crewe’s Political despatch no. 18, dated the 8th March 1912, approving the action of Lord Hardinge’s Govern ment in sanctioning the grant of an office allowance to His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain to cover certain charges previously met by separate fixed allotments. 2. One feature of the scheme then introduced was the conversion oc certain pensionable posts into non-pensionable appointments paid from the office allowance. Though the arrangement possesses certain advantages, in some instances it results in hardship to individuals. His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain has reported that, in April 1917, with a view to training a suitable successor for his head clerk (a pensionable appointment), he obtained the services of one Munshi Muhammad Mohsin Khan, who holds a substantive civil appointment in the Punjab, on probation for six months on a pay of Its. 120 a month, payable from his office allowance. The necessity for this arose in connection with an arrangement under which the permanent incumbent of the post was to be transferred to Meshed to relieve the attache to His Majesty’s Consul-General at that place, who contemplated proceeding on long leave. The latter, however, subsequently postponed his leave and consequently the vacancy which it was intended that Munshi Muhammad Mohsin Khan should fill did not actually occur. But the opportunity was taken to utilise his services by appointing him as an additional clerk on the pay above mentioned, to cope with the great stress of work entailed by the war, the cost of the arrangement being met from the Sistan allowance. 3. Under the terms of article 365 of the Civil Service Regulations, however, Munshi Muhammad Mohsin Khan is debarred from reckoning towards pension any portion of the period during which he is paid from the Sistan office allowance, which is a contract allowance. The objection to the2 service paid from the contract allowance counting for pension is in this purely technical, because the clerk is employed on Government work and w transferred to the post in the public interest. Munshi Muhammad Moh ^ Khan has about 8 years* pensionable service at his credit and he will su ff lri severely if the rules are strictly enforced. We, therefore, recommend th? % the provisions of the article referred to may be relaxed in his favour. at ' We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) CHELMSPORD, „ C.

It is possible even, in view of the extension of our military activities northwards and the general increase of work which may result therefrom, that the services of these trusty followers may at any time become even more urgently needed than in the past. 3.

In the case of all other consular escorts in Persia, the entire expend iture is met from the auditable head “ Escort Charges ”. In the case of the Sistan consular escort however, the expenditure on pay, rations and clothing alone is so met, the remainder of the charges, amounting to Rs. 6,300, being met from the “Office AllowanceWe see no advantage in the retention of this anomalous arrangement, and we therefore recommend, for your sanction, that all expenditure on the Sistan consular escort should be debited to “ Escort Charges ” with effect from April 1st, 1916, the grant under that head being increased by Rs. 6,800 and the grant under “ Office Allowance f * being cor respondingly reduced. 3. We have also to report that we have sanctioned excesses of Rs. 2,857-4-5 and Rs. 1,716-15-9 over the “ Office Allowance ** of the Sistan Consulate for the years 1914-15 and 1915-16, respectively. Of the former sum, Rs. 2,373-12-5 are on account of arms, accoutrements and Ordnance Stores charges which are now debited to the Civil Department, the value of such articles, less depreciation, being refunded by the Military to the Civil Department on return of the consular escort to India. The greater part of the balance is due to a higher expenditure on medical provided for in the “ Office AllowanceOf the latter sum, Rs. 1,021-14-0 are accounted for by expenditure on account of arms, &amp;c„ while the balance of the excess was occasioned by enhanced rates caused by the war.

The necessity for this charge has been reviewed again. His Britannic Majesty’s consul for Sistan and Kain in his letter no. 75, dated the 26th January 1917, a copy of which is enclosed, while admitting that the retention of the eight Ghulams can no longer be regarded as necessary for the purposes of protection, states that he considers their services invaluable in other respects. In these circumstances, we support the consul’s request and recommend that the increased guard may he retained for anotner year and that the temporary addition of R1,000 to the consul’s office allowance may he continued during the year 1917-1918.

During the year 1916 the Sistan Levy Corps has been inexistence under the administration of this Consulate and the presence of the Sistan Pield Force in Eastern Persia has created a general state of peace in this District which has only been interrupted by a few spasmodic and sudden periods of insecurity on the main roads such as wdien bands of robbers attacked our military convoys between Sistan and Bandan in January, February and April last- 3. In these circumstances the maintenance of a few armed Ghulams in the Consulate Escort cannot be said to be necessary during the year 1917 for purposes of our protection, but as I represented in my report of last year (paragraph 5 of my letter No. 1167, dated the 4th December 1915) the Ghulams I perform many other duties than those of a combatant nature. The services of these men -were invaluable during the Military Supply crisis of last spring, and they have always been employed so far as they could be spared from the ordinary duties of my office in working for the benefit of the troops and the Levy Corps. If they were discharged I would have to replace them by temporary men who would be paid out of my Secret Service grant. 4. In these circumstances I request that the services of the 8 Ghulams may be retained during the year 1917-18 and that the temporary addition of Rs. 1,000 may be continued to my Office Allowance. S. G.

Enclosure^to despatch No.3^ of igr P % o w I K No. 1167, dated Sistan, the 4th December 1915. From—MAJOR F. B. Peidbaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with letter No. 1637 Est.-B, dated the 20th July 1915, from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department on the subject of the temporary retention of eight armed Ghulams in this Consulate and to submit herewith the annual report required by His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. 2. The period now to he reviewed dates from the 1st December 1914. It seems unnecessary that I should dilate much on the ordinary forms of insecurity which have prevailed in Eastern Persia this year, as the War has of course overshadowed everything else, and the German menace at the time of writing is a very real and serious matter. 3. I will, therefore, briefly mention that, inspite of the visit of Shaukat- ul-Mulk, Governor of the newly-formed Province, with his freshly raised army to Sistan last winter, there has been little diminution of minor highway rob beries committed by bands of Afghans numbering from six to twenty men, while the forays of tribes pursuing their blood-feuds and the movements of gun-runners have created just the same scares as in previous recent years. 4. During eight months of the year Afghan robbers were frequenting the main roads. Blood-feud parties, whose objects were often not properly under stood, were active during three months, and small bands of Sarhaddi raiders visited or approached Kainat on three occasions, viz., in December 1914, January 1915 and October 1915. The Governor’s troops clearly showed them selves to be afraid of the Baluchis in April 1915 with the result that a large 11111,11 band of Sarhaddis boldly entered Sistan early in August 1915, on a peaceable mission certainly, viz., to buy supplies, but m defiance of the local authorities* orders, and left late in September 1915 without being molested. 5. In these circumstances alone I would unhesitatingly submit that the strength of the Consular Escort should not be further reduced. The introduc tion of the German complication last July, it seems hardly necessary to state, caused me very much to regret that I advised the Government of India last year to reduce my Consular escort even by four horses. All my armed sowars have been very much in request during the last six months, the three most prominent occasions being when the German expedition at Kain threatened to visit Birjand in July 1915, when Mr. Dormer led a reconnoitring party to Naiband in August‘l915, and when Mr. New toured in the tracks of Herr Pashen in Eastern Kainat in September 1915. Throughout all this period^ I was compelled to maintain extra temporary armed levies, who, in the special circumstances, were naturally more expensive and less reliable than the regular pension-earning servants of the Consulate, and when I myself marched from Birjand to Sistan in October 1915, I found it necessary to obtain from^ the British Military Commander at Birjand a small Infantry Escort in addition for the protection of my caravan. 6. Furthermore, the presence of two comparatively large bodies of British Indian troops at Sistan and Birjand is entailing upon my office and menial staff a great deal of extra work as all my resources are continually being indented upon for assistance in various ways. To such an extent is this the case that I have- recently engaged an additional Mirza (Persian Clerk) and several temporary messengers. 7. In these circumstances, I beg to recommend that the temporary additional grant of Bs 1,000 may be continued to my Office Allowance during the year 1916-17. f. h P, D«pi Pm*—Ho. 214—i 4-1-18—14.* Copy, GOYEENMENT OP INDIA.

The office allow ance originally sanctioned amounted to Rs. 25,000 a year, but it now stands at Rs. 28,500 a year owing to the changes indicated in the correspondence marginally quoted. 2. In calculating the office allowance the fact that the annual ex penditure under “ Postage and Telegram Charges ” in the Sistan consulate had, in past years, averaged Rs. 3,000, was taken into account, but experience recently acquired has proved that the inclusion of this item of expenditure in the office allowance is an unsatisfactory arrangement as the cost of telegrams must necessarily vary with circumstances which cannot be anticipated. The present political situation in Persia, for example, has rendered constant telegraphic communication by the consul imperative, with the inevitable result that the outlay on telegrams has increased so considerably that it is no longer possible for the consul to defray the charges from his office allowance. It is estimated that, in order to meet the excess expenditure on telegrams during the current financial year, a special grant of Rs. 7,200 to the Sistan consulate will be necessary. 3.

W e have the honour to invite a reference to your Lordship’s despatch No. 125 (Political), dated the 23rd October 1914, in which sanction was conveyed to the retention of the additional guards at the Sistan Consulate, on the understanding that the necessity for their continuance, which is provided for by the temporary increase of the Consul’s office allowance by Rs. 2,000 per annum, will be reviewed at the end of each year. 2. In his letter No. 190 C., dated the 11th December 1914, of which we enclose a copy for your Lordship’s information, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain describes the present condition of that Province. We concur in his opinion that, until the state of the country improves, it would he most unwise to reduce the strength of his escort. We recommend, therefore, that the existing establishment be retained during the year 1915-16, hut that, as suggested by the Consul, four of the horses provided for the eight armed ghulams be dispensed with, thus reducing the temporary increase in the office allowance of the Consulate from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 1,000 per annum. We trust that our proposal will meet with your Lordship’s approval.

The number of Revenue gendarmes has just been redSby about 60 men owing to the extreme necessity for retrenchment forced on the Persian 3. Baluch raiders.—A. small band menaced Neb durino-January 1914 A Sistani caravan was looted at Nasratabad JSipeh by possibly Uie same band in February, in April, two bands went norbwaids and comllftted robberie, near Lab-i-Banng and JSeb. in May, a third and large Lashkar attacked Alia bad near Jjandatij but soon afterwards returned soutii owing to one of the smaller bands having sustained a reverse at tbe hands of the Governor’s Camel Corps near Neb. In November, one large Lashkar of 200 to 300 men and a smaller troop of about 60 men were very active and collected a considerable amount of loot from between Kbabis and Lehanen JLgueh. These two bands are probably still on tbe war-path. 4. Afghan robbers.—The trade roads, both north and south of Sistan were rendered unsafe by bands of Afghans in April, May, October and Nov ember. In the last-named month, a large British caravan only escaped capture by the merest chance, tbe Afghans decamping across the border after they had unwittingly attacked a caravan of Sarhaddis, who were exporting wheat from Sistan, and bad killed four of them. 5. Afghan gun-runners.—Ymiom parties engaged in this pursuit crossed tbe trade route in February, March, April, July, August, November and Dec ember. They occasionally did a little damage to the telegraph line. 6. ^ Conditions produced by the war.—At present the Persians of Sistan and Kain show little excitement, but over tbe Afgnau border feelin 0, is said to be much stronger. A band of 800 “ Giiazis ” actually once set out from near Ginshk in November to attack the Shias of both Afghanistan and Persia They were, however, soon controlled and turned back by their own authorities* If the Turkish Government snould be muon humiliated, it is possible that* Afghan fanaticism miy yet prove a very serious factor. 7. A consideration of these facts will, I hope, satisfy the Government of India that the present state of tne country is not as sale as it should be. It must, of course, be admitted that a great improvement should soon be expected from the raising of the new force in Birjanct which has been armed with the 700 Lee-Enfield rifles imported through India. This force has not, however, yet encountered the Sarhaddis, and if it ventures on offensive operations* without co-operation from the Kerman side, wnere the gendarmerie force apparently has not progressed much, it remains to be seen now it will acquit itself. In the meanwhile, until its courage and confidence have been estab lished as the result o! some successful operation, I do not think that the armed escort of this Consulate should be reduced. f8. Every year parties from this Consulate pass np and down the road from Koh Malik Siah to Birjand, while others spend weeks on the line of Boundary Pillars (about 180 miles in length) on inspection duty and in con nection with the annual repairs. When Baluch raiders and Afghan robbers $1 are on the war-path, it is undesirable that we should have to rely for protection mainly on escorts of Persian soldiers who would probably leave us in the lurch in a crisis. 9. With all this, I realise most fully that the Government of India must be most anxious to stop or reduce the temporary contribution of Rs. 2,000 per annum in consideration of the difficult financial situation engendered by the war. In these circumstances, I suggest that Rs. 1,000 which is the cost of maintenance of four horses for a year in this district may be cut down in the next year’s Budget. 10. Roughly, the cost of my eight armed and mounted Ghulams is Rs. 4,500 per annum, of which Rs. 2,000 are spent on the feed of their horses. The men themselves are indispensable, and there can be no question of dis charging them, as when at headquarters they supplement the service of Messengers (Eerrashes, Chuprassis or Peons) of whom we possess only four other men. The latter number of course is quite inadequate for a Consulate which comprises three Gazetted Officers (one Consul and two Vice- Consuls), two English clerks (of the Telegraph Department) and a ministerial office of four Indian clerks. 11. Apart from the fact that it is always customary for a few Persian mounted Ghulams to precede the Consul and his Cavalry Escort when he goes out on ceremonial occasions, there will be a great inconvenience in.reducing the number of Ghulams* horses altogether; for in Birjand, where there is no Military Escort with the Vice-Consul, it is most desirable that some of the Ghulams should be mounted and able to accompany that officer when he rides to the Governor’s residence, two miles outside the town. The consideration of this point need not, however, be taken up seriously now, if the Government accept my view that for military reasons it is not desirable this year to reduce the mounted Escort by so many as eight men. fsariflpi 4 Potttitol Dept.

B, dated the 21st September 1912, from the Govern ment of India m the Foreign Department to my predecessor's address, I have the honour to submit the following review of the conditions which have existed m this part of Persia during the year 1913. 2. Local unrest.— year opened in Sistan somewhat unpropitiously, as the newly constructed Finance Department had been reorganising the salaries or all local officials and servants, and a large percentage of the soldiery con tinued on strike until well into April. Much dissatisfaction also existed amongst the agricultural classes, who gave vent to their feelings in an occa sional assault on subordinate Bevenue Collectors. The agrarian discontent culminated at the end of March in a popular and noisy demonstration, shared m by the tradespeople of Sistan city, against Monsieur Paquet himself. The Customs-house and Director’s residence were surrounded and bombarded with stones, and at last I was appealed to by Monsieur Paquet to “ intervene with force” to save his life. During the next few months, the Department worked cautiously, while at the same time a good deal of enlisting and drillin 0, of gendarmes was done. In August, the Director was able to organise a strong force of 720 men, including military and tribal contingents, which succeeded in riving a Baluch agricultural tribe of 400 houses out of Sistan, since then a largei revenue has been collected from the cultivators and shopkeepers of the district than has been recorded of any previous year. In the autumn, however, the gendarmerie force itself gave signs of having got out of hand. These cul minated in an outrage on a British caravan to settle which satisfactorily the Director has shown himself to be both powerless and unwilling. At the close of the year there is considerable jealousy between the subordinates of the Deputy Governor and those of the Finance Director. When Shaukat-ul- Mulk’s troops are being raised here, some watchfulness and tact will probably he required to prevent an open outbreak. In Birjand a similar state of friction has been apparent throughout the year. 3. Baluch raids. —These have continued merrily and unchecked through out the year. A large lashkar of Ismailzais started out from Sarhad in March 1913. It looted the border villages of Tabbas district and Kainat. Early in May, another lashkar invaded Kainat and looted all the villages from Aliabad to Shusp on the main caravan road from Sistan to Birjand. It then circled round the west and north flanks of the latter town, and blocked the road to Meshed for a short period. • • ^ tillages of northern Kainat were again swept of most of their livestock by a party under Naib Sher Muhammad and Taj Muhammad had come from the direction of the Kerman desert. A small band of Slstani Baluchis during the same month penetrated as far as the border of Turbat-i-Haidari! In December, another large lashkar started out from Sarhad under Shah Sowar Khan, nephew of Mir Jehind. A number of Sistanis went off to ioin the band. -Afghan bandits. —The main roads both north and south of Sistan have been rendered unsafe by a small band of Afghans who attack small and un guarded caravans with great regularity. Consequently it has been found necessary to requisition armed guards from the Military Department in Sistau lor every British caravan or party of travellers throughout the year.2 5. Afghan gun-runners .—Followers of this industry continue to cross the Sistan-Koh-i-Malik Siah road with impunity. In August 1913, they came into conflict with a Brahui caravan which was being escorted by road-sowars. These lawless Afghans constitute a continual menace to our trade. 6 Unrest in Afghanistan.— opinion has it that lawful authority stands* at a low ebb at the present date along the western border of Afghanistan. Petty outrages against Sistan and Kainat have periodically occurred, and the riots which took place in Kandahar last September had a bad effect all over the province. The British outlaw Nausherwan^ with his followiD 01 is still at large, though at the present moment sheltered in Persian Sistan. °It is quite possible that he will return in the near future across the border to continue harassing us. 7. The British Consulate stands as the most prominent and permanent advocate and supporter of law and order in Sistan. The interests of our trade and the security of the numerous British subjects in the province demand that the Consulate should be able to obtain a respectful hearing from the leaders of the various antagonistic elements in the country, and there is no doubt that a little visible force behind the Consul produces a tremendous and beneficial moral effect. In paragraphs 2 to 6 I have shown-that the present condition of the country is highly unsettled and unsatisfactory. I do not doubt that, if the ConsuPs escort had been much smaller than it is, so as to necessitate the employment of Persian guards when the Consul went on tour, or as to confine him to his house in the case of a local riot, our prestige would have been much reduced, and the evil spirits of the community would have pursued their courses, molesting trade and defying authority, with much greater equanimity. 8. I trust that the Government of India will be fully satisfied in view of this report as regards the wisdom of their policy in maintaining the Consular escort above its normal strength during the year 1913-14, and I hope that they will be pleased to continue the special allowance of Its. 2,000 for the year 1914-15 for the same purpose. 9. In my opinion, until the Swedish take over the protec tion of this Province, the local conditions will never be so much improved as to render us secure from possible relapses to the present state of affairs.

In fixing the allotment at Rs. 25,000, provision was made for an annual expenditure of Rs. 650 under the head “ Supplies and Services— Medical Supplies’h It has, however, now transpired that, though this sum of Rs. 650 represented the ^ annual budget grant under the head referred to above, additional expenditure averaging Rs. 2,500 a year is being incurred on medical supplies, the latter amount being adjusted by hook transfer between the Military Supply Department, who provide the stores, and the Comptroller, India Treasuries. 3.

To THE MOST HONOURABLE THE MARQUIS OF CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 7th November 1912, My Lord Marquis, ^ We have the honour to address your Lordship on the subject of the provision of furniture at Government expense for the reception rooms at the Seistan Consulate. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul in Seistan has re presented to us that hitherto no grant for “the provision of furniture for the Consulate has ever been made, and that the furniture now in the public reception rooms is both inadequate and unsuitable, being largely composed of articles which can be made use of when the Consul goes on tour. 2. The request appears to us reasonable, and we, therefore, propose with your Lordship’s approval to sanction an expenditure not exceeding Rs. 1,700, including cost of packing and freight, for the provision of suitable furniture for the two reception rooms at the Consulate, the charge being divisible between Home and Indian revenues. The maintenance charges for the furniture will be met from the Consul’s contract allowance. We would explain that the liability of Government to provide furniture on certain conditions to our Consulates in Persia was admitted by Lord Minto’s Government in 1906, and our present proposal is in accordance with the terms of a Resolution, dated the 9th June 1906, which was then recorded, and a copy of which we enclose for your Lordship’s information. * 3. We trust, therefore, that your Lordship will be pleased to sanction the expenditure proposed.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. iFOREIGHtf D E IP A. R T M EITSTT. RESOLUTION. Simla, the 9th June 1906. The number and diversity of applications received from Consular Officers subordinate to the Government of India with regard to the grant of allowances, the rent and furnishing of residences, and the supply of tents and camp furniture, &amp;c., have pointed to the necessity for framing some general regu lations on these subjects. The Governor-General in Council has accordingly decided, after careful consideration, to lay down the following principles, which will be applicable to all Consular Officers serving under the Government of India in Persia and the Persian Gulf, Arabia or Mesopotamia :— 1. In the case of the principal Consular Officer at each Consulate-General, Consulate or Vice-Consulate, but not for his Assistants— (a) the Consular residence w r ill be occupied free of rent; (b) two reception rooms, but no more, will be plainly furnished, and the furniture will be maintained at Government expense. This furniture, which will not include such articles as pianos, billiard tables or curtains, will be rent-free; (c) tents, and Sown ^de camp furniture, for use with the tents, will be supplied and maintained by Government from the contingent grant. 2. No furniture for any other rooms and no table equipment, china, glass, cutlery, plate, lamps, or linen will be provided by Government. 3. In the case of commissioned medical officers and gazetted Assistants to the Consul-General or Consul, where the officer has hitherto been allowed, under any express sanction of Government, to occupy any Government build ing free of rent, he will be allowed to continue to do so, but no furniture, table equipment, &amp;c., will be allowed. 4. No rent will be charged for furniture, table equipment, &amp;c., the use of which Consular Officers already enjoy under existing conditions. Such furniture, &amp;c., may be retained free of cost by the Consulate concerned, but no grant for its maintenance or renewal will be made, and no expenditure may be incurred thereon from contingent grants or any other public funds. 5. The grant of local and sumptuary allowances will, as heretofore, be decided on the merits of each case after an examination of the local conditions prevailing at the particular post. 6. The rules regulating the grant of outfit allowances are contained in the Kesolution of the Government of India in the Finance Department, No. 2720, dated the 23rd May 1888. It is to be understood that such grants are admissible only in the case of officers proceeding on special temporary political missions to Persia, or other countries beyond the British Indian frontier, and not in the case of officers appointed to permanent political establishments in those countries.

Sir With reference to the letter from the (Jovernment of India in the Foreign Department, Eo. 15-C., dated the 23rd November 1911, I am directed to intimate that His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India has sanctioned the introduction of the office allowance system in the Sistan Consulate. 2. In supersession of the rules laid down in paragraph 2 of the letter cited above, the following rules are prescribed for the regulation of expenditure under the new system:- (1) The annual grant must not be exceeded in any case; the Consul being held personally responsible for any excess. (2) All establishment paid from the office allowance willwill tie non-pensionable, but special arrangements will be made, aa explained in paragraph 3 below, to proteot, in certain cases, the interests of officers who held pension able appointments under Government, prior to the introduc- tion of present arrangenaents. (3) The Consul will not have the power to bind his suocessor to the scale of charges adopted by him. (4) The Consul will submit to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, monthly, an account, supported by vouchers, °f payments from the office allowance. (5) The Consul may not draw more than one-fourth of the annual office allowance, each quarter, without the specific orders of the Government of India. (6) Any Expended balance of the office allowance will lapse at the end of each finanoial year. (7) Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, the leave rules in the Civil Service Begulations will not be applic able to any members of the establishment paid from the office allowance, but they will he entitled to such leave and such allowance as the Consul may decide to grant. ( 8 ) Sale proceeds of old furniture and other Govern ment property will not in future be credited to Government inin the ordinary manner, hut will he added to the amount of the office allowance at the disposal of the Consul. A separate account, should, however, he maintained of all amounts realised from the sale of Durhar presents and submitted annually for the information of the Govern ment of India* (9) The rules in Article 98 of the Civil Account Code, Volume I, as regards contingent charges, will not he applicable to any purchases made from the office allowance. 3. With reference to rules (8) and (7) referred to in paragraph 2 above, I am to explain that two classes of oases are likely to arise as regards the incumbents of posts, which were paid from general revenues and were pensionable, but which are now paid from the office allowance and are accordingly non-pensienable, viz :~ (a) of men whose services are no longer required by the Consul; and (b) of men whose services are required by the Consul, and who will be paid from the office allowance. (i) Cases falling under Tn) should be dealt with under the rules in Section II of Chapter XVIII of the Civil Service Regulations(i^i) As regards cases falling under (b), subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, the Government of India are pleased to decide :« (1) that all service paid from the office allowance will be treated as foreign service of the first kind, in respect of which no contribution for leave allowances and pension will be payable; and (2) that the officers concerned will continue to obtain leave under the Civil Service Regulations, subject to the discretionary control of the Consul* All allowances during privilege leave, whether taken by itself or in combination with other leave, will be met from the office allowance, while allowances during long leave will be met from general revenues, the rule in Article 335 (a) f Civil Service Regulations, being relaxed for this purpose Under the above rules, for the period during which an officer is paid from the office allowance, the calculation of his emoluments counting towards pension will be based on the pay he was drawing immediately prior to his transfer to the quasi ~ foreign service, following the rule in Articles 779(b) and 754(b) (ii). Civil Service Regulations,while his allowances during long leave will be similarly calculated. During privilege leave the Consul can give him If the officer is at a Ister date transferred to a pension able post under Government, he will simply be reverting from foreign service to Government service proper; and for the period during which he holds such pensionable post, the calculation of his emoluments for the purposes of leave allowances and pension will be based on the pay of the latter appointment. Should the Consul cease to require the services of an officer belonging to this class, he should give him three months' notice of discharge, and at the same time advise the Government of India of his intention. If no suitable appointment in Government service can be provided for the officer, he will be liable to be retired under the rules governing the grant of compensation pension. I am to request that you will furnish the Comptroller, India Treasuries, direct with a oomplete list of officers falling under this class. 4. In view of the peculiar conditions of service in Sistan, any 8x-L.ovvanoe he pleases, not less than the pay that he drew in his last pensionable appointment under Government. wherewhere incumbents of pensionable posts will ordinarily be recruited by selection from the non-pensionable establishment, the Government of India are pleased to grant a general exemption from the provisions of Article 478(a), Civil Service Regulations f to all non-gazetted establishment in the Sistan Consulate.

My Lord Marquis, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Lordship’s despatch No. 18 (Political), dated the 8th March 1912, in which our action in sanctioning an office allowance of Rs. 25,000 per annum to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Seistan, to coyer certain charges hitherto met by separate fixed allotments, was approved. 2. In paragraph 2 of our despatch No. 160 (Secret—Establishment), dated the 17th November 1910, we reported that a saving of approximately Rs. 4-2,000 had been effected in the annual budget allotment for the Consulate. This esti mate was ba^ed on the assumption that the reduction of the strength of the Consular escort from thirty to thirteen, which had received our approval, would at once be carried into effect. Subsequently, however, at the instance of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, it was decided, in view of the disturbed condi tion of Persia, to postpone, for a time, the full reduction, and to retain the strength at twenty men. In consequence, there must be some diminution, in the current year, in the saving of Rs. 42,000 which we anticipated. 3. The Consul now recommends that the original reduction to thirteen members may be carried out, and proposes, in addition, to dispense with the services of one Duffadar and one Sowar of the local Levies. In order, however, to maintain the complement of twenty armed men, which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, is the minimum desirable as long as Persia continues in its present state, he suggests that the locally recruited ghidam establishment (four in number) should be increased from four to eight, that their pay should be raised in order to obtain good and reliable men, and they should be armed and drilled. 4. We propose to approve of these proposals, which have the support of His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. The financial effect of the scheme is an increase of expenditure of approximately Rs. 2,000 a year until such time 5I5./' 1 - 5~2 as the full reduction contemplated in our despatch of the 17th November 1910 can be effected, and a consequent decrease by that amount in the estimat ed saving of Rs. 42,000 a year. To provide for this increase we would request Your Lordship’s sanction to increase temporarily the Consul’s office allowance by Rs. 2,000, e., from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 27,000, the necessity for continuing this temporary increase being reviewed every year.

Before submitting report referred to m paragraph 3 of our Despatch dated 6th July 1911, 74, and issuing final orders on the subject, we consider it desirable that suitability of our proposals, which include i ntroduction of syste m of office _allowances somewhat on the lines of t hat 'ob taining in Consula tes under LondorTFoi eign Office, should He examined on spot by experienced officer, w h° would explain system to local authorities and hear and meet their objections, if any, and consider practicability of effecting further reductions. For this purpose we propose to depute Wood, now temporary additional Secretary to Government of India in the Foreign Department, whose services will be available about loth February. -Terms will be salarv on time scale plus usual deputation and travelling allowances, and deputation will last about two months. Small establishment will also be required. Total cost of proposals will be about Rs. 5,900., excluding travelling allowances. We trust your Lordship will be pleased to sanction this proposal, and that the cost will be borne by Home and Indian revenues in equal shares. We should be glad of orders by telegram, as, if approved, Wood should start about the middle of February, as it is important that revised scheme should be introduced on 1st April. 1 N *.2 *—■■■ A No. 22 oe 1912.

To The Most Honourable the MARQUIS or CREWE, K.G., His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Calcutta, the 25th January 1912. My Lord Marquis, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Lordship’s telegram dated the 13th July 1911, confirming the orders issued by Lord Minto’s Government for the reduction of expenditure in the Seistan Consulate. 2. Since those orders were issued, various representations have been made to us by Major O’Connor, the Consul in Seistan, regarding tbe inadequacy of the grants sanctioned under some of the beads, and the difficulty of working up to each separate item in the sanctioned scale. We recognise the force of some of these objections, and. wffiile we are not prepared to entertain any proposals which w 7 ould diminish the saving of over Rs. 42,000 a year already secured, we think that it is desirable, with a view both \o economy and to efficient work- in 0 * to give the Consul a freer hand in regard to details of expenditure and to relieve him of the obligation of referring to the Government of India for sanction to any petty variation of the Consulate charges which may from time to time be found advisable. Your Lordship will readily understand that in distant and isolated posts, like the Seistan Consulate, it is difficult, except at an unjustifiable cost, to maintain a clerical establishment capable of dealing with accounts on the lines prescribed by our Audit Codes, while the incon venience and delay which correspondence on petty points of audit involves in these cases far outweigh the advantages sought to be attained. For these reasons we have now decided, on the analogy of the Consulates under the London Foreign Office, to place at the Consul’s disposal an office allowance of Rs. 25,000 a year which wdll cover a large portion of the establishment and other charges hitherto met by separate fixed allotments, ihe details of the charges to be met from this allowance will be left to the Consul s discretion, and he will be at liberty to vary the scale, subject to certain conditions, I2 without reference to higher authority. A copy of the orders which we have issued to the Consul is enclosed. We trust that our proceedings will meet with your Lordship’s approval. We have the honour to he, My Loud Maequis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) HARDINGE oe PENSHURST. „ O’M. CREAGH. „ GUY ELEETWOOD WILSON. „ R. W. CARLYLE. „ S. H.

I am to inform you that the Government of India have now decided, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, to whom a report on the subject is being made, that, with effect from the 1st March 1912, an office allowance of Rs. 25,000 a year shall he placed at your disposal to cover all charges in the Seistan Con sulate except those mentioned on the margin. The details of all expenditure including establishments which is to be met from the office allowance are left entirely to your discretion, and you will be at liberty to vary the scale of charges from time to time without sanction of higher authority, subject to the follow ing conditions:— (1) The annual grant must not be exceeded in any case; (2) all establishment (except present incumbents of pensionable appointments) paid from the office allowance will be non- pensionable; (3) you will have no power to hind your successor to the scale of charges adopted by you; and (4) you will render to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, monthly, an account, supported by vouchers, of all payments from the office allowance. In view of the fact that the amount of the office allowance is based on the detailed estimates already sanctioned, it has been considered unnecessary to consult you further on the subject before the issue of orders. 3.
