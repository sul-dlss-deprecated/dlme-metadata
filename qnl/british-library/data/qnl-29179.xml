It is my duty; you are my Government; and that is wny 1 am writing to you the following letter. Please investigate the matter carefully• The Ruler of Shargah, Sultan oin Sagar, and two other men who are from you, namely, K.S. Husain bin Abdur Rahman and Abdur Rahman bin Hasan, have joined together secretly and do not^to expose each other before your eyes. Their tactics I am going to write as oelow: ShaiJdi It is since 20 to 25 days that/Sultan’s brother-in-law and two Arabs conspired to murder Jaixinam property Bhamanmal in his house and loot all his/estate. One of the se two Arabs did not agree to it and was consequently turned out of the conspiracy, as soon as this man xxjut a&amp;t left the conspirators they toolc advice from others and the Shaikh's brother-in-law and his friend bum’ah - thes two men - agreed to rob bhamanmal’s house and murder him. They brought a picture, which was sewn, to Dhamanmal and said that there was gold in it and that they wanted t o sell it to him. They left it in bhamanmalV house in the hope that they would come back afterwards. Then they did not turn up. bhamanmal went to Shaikh and said that two men had brought that thing (ie the picture) to him but did not turn up God knows why. The Shaikh said that he would be present when bhamanmal would open it. The conspirators knew all that was happening, as soon as the picture was opened,sea sand appeared in it. When the Shaikh saw it he arrested these men (conspirators and put them in jail for 6 days . On the 7th day theyboth were freed from jail. Then tiiey made a faloe claim on hhamanmal before ii.S. Husain tiiat hhamanmal had misappropriated gold from it. Khojas, Arabs and Laphios (?) gatered together in a majlis in which the two conspirators were also present. In the second ma^lis their falsehood came out. fter one or two days the third majlis will take place, nowever, tiiey are harassing people with such things. There is (need of) another Political Agency ^ near Oman in which unless you keep a European Officer things will not be set right. Please think over it so that your subjects may become happy. The Second Complaint Two days ago , in Shargah, a certain Arab Humaid bin Aiail by name^ caused the murder of his cow-woman without reason, w/hen such things happen Khan Sahib remains quiet. So a European Officer is 'V necessary. This is my petition before the Political Agent. M’B. Those who differed from the two conspirators have been kept in jail since last lb days and given beating. The Shaikh said to these men: '• Why did you open the secret before th public? Now give evidence against Dhamanmal about the gold’! Dhamanmal is apoor man as well as honest and the Shaikh is harassing him. He may die as a result of this harassing. You may send a telegram to Hasan to release these men from jail or keep them under his caren n r' (fT) N Iranslation of letter No.228 aatea the hOtxi March from K.S.nusain bin Hasan T Amaa, in cnarge current euties of the Residency Agent, Sharjah, to the Political iigent, Bahrain.

A ^0^ After Compliments. ) Reference your letter No.l58.B/lO dated the 19th April 1936 regarding the breaking into the shop of Mohandas Dhamanaml and the robbing of its contents. 2. I beg to inform you that when the theft took place in the said shop, I was in Abu Musa helping Commander Rainier in his affairs. After two days I arrived in Sharjah and I was informed by my cousin T Abdur Rahman bin Husain about the incident that betook of the shop of Dhaman and Bhaman ? s complaint to the Shaikh who, accompanied by some other persons, went to the shop of the Bunia in question. Thereupon I instituted enquiries in the matter and aksed Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, to make enquiries and take the necessary action as tne shop was situated in the market and the Ruler was responsible to protect the property and the lives of British subjects who live in his country. Because the Shaikh details guards to the market and appoints their headman who takes watching fee from the merchants and the shop-keepers ana pays the salaries of the watchmen therefrom. I wrote letter No.235 dateu the 15th Muharram 1355 to Shaikh Sultan, Ruler of Sharjah, and received a reply No.5 dated the 15th Muharram 1355 from him in which he said that he made enquiries in the matter and it was found that Dhamana himself committed this act. The Shaikh added that the watchmen were not guilty so that he may imprison and punish them, but out of regard to us, he would imprison them. Immediately I myself went to the Shaikh and advised him that it is incumbent on him to attend to such cases as he is responsible for them. If he does not take the necessary steps in the case of Dhaman, the Governmentwill take up the case as was done in man/ cases ol tneits which occurred in the market anu tne G-oveminent mane the Ruler of Sharjah to pay for on account of his negligence(to take necessary action). Consequently the Shaikn imprisoned the watch-men but it was really not a rigorous imprisonment. He nin arrest the hean of the watch-men so tnat it may be known that he died his best in the matter. After two days I asked the Shaikh to senu the watchmen to the Residency Agency, Sharjah which he din. 1 made enquires and obtained from six them/statements which are sent herewith for your perusal. I also asked for the presence of the persons who accompanied the Shaikh including T Abdur Rahman bin Husain who went to the shop of khaman and saw the spot. They said that in tneir opinion Dhaman alone could not do that act,unless he has been helped by someone as the case is serious. The breaking of an iron safe in a shop without being noticed wnile the watchmen watch inside the market and on the tops of the shops is very difficult. I send herewith a paper signed by those concerned for your perusal. 3. I beg to inform you tnat from the investigations made in connection with the shop of Dhaman and the thing which 1 witnessed, it appeared to me that the act was not committed by one person. Shaikh Sultan says that this nas been done by Lhaman himself. This is possible but he must have had someone to help him in the matter. I am of opinion that it is not possible that the heau of the watchmen was not aware of this happening because the post of the watenmen is near the shop of Dhaman. but when the Snaikii saw that the ring of the shop was there broken from inside and all those present said that it was done by Jjham&amp;n himself and did not take steps for making thorough'enquiries in the matter. Decision rests with you. Usual ending.Translation of letter No*235 dated the 15th Muharram 1355 (i.e.,9.3.1936) from the Residency Agent, oharjah, to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler 6f Sharjah.

My cousin r Abdur Rahman bin Husain informed me theft a theft took place in the shop of Dhaman bunia and that he together with a number of merchants and yourself went to the spot, examined the broken iron safes and the broken rings. 0 T Shaikh 1 The commitment of such acts in the market would adversely aiiect the business. In the circumstance you should imprison and punish the guards of the market as they are responsible for losses which are caused by thefts. What is the use of keeping guards if such things are allowed to happen. You are aware that Dhaman is a Sritish subject and therefore I cannot keep silent at the aggressions which are done to him. I request you to do your best and to make thorough investigations with a view to recovering the stolen things from the thieves, If you show negligence in the matter, you will be held responsible and you will be called upon to answer for it.

After Compliments. I am in receipt of your letter No.235 aatea the 15th Muharram 1355 (i.e.,9.3.36) the contents of which have been duly noted by me. Regarding the act which Lhaman committed, local and foreign merchants and also myself made the neeessary investigations in tne matter and found that the act was done by Bhaman himself as all the signs which we saw such as the breaking of the inner door rings and the safe and the opening of the second safe without a key and without breaking it,clearly indicated that this act was not done by an outsider. The act of Dhaman by taking the key. of Kaiso T s shop from his cousin Jetha, opening Kaiso f s safes in the meantime and entering the shop at 5 and 7 0 T clock at night which is not customary for him to do as he lives in the room on the top of the shop, and other reasons will support this contention. In the circumstances, the complaints of my subjects against Bhaman in connection with the gold which was in the basket appear to be genuine. This man ! s antecedents are known. There have been several charges of theft against him in Bubai and elsewhere of which you are aware. I hold him responsible for committing such acts and trying thereby to spoil the name of my town. I do not see any use of his remaining in my town any longer as the consequences of such acts are serious. Please come today and see his acts yourself as hearing is not like seeing. You wanted me to imprison the guards. They did not commit any offence and die. not see any thief so that they may be punished. If you want them to be imprisoned though tney are not guilty, 1 will do so out of regard to you so that the acts of Bhaman may be revealed to you.U.E.

I at once gave the key of the shop whidj is in the market to habib T s son who opened the door of the shop. 1 took the key from the boy, went to the southern door and opened it. I entered the shop together with Habib. I sat on my place as usual but found that the despatch box was broken. I disapproved this action. Then i found the drawer of the iron safe outside. Thereupon I began making searen as a result of which 1 found the aoor of the cupboard which was under the iron safe open and its lock broken. I also found the small iron safe broken-open. There were in it its.431, 17# tolas and 2 annas worth of gold wrapped in a piece of cloth, about 7 tolas of gold wrapped in another piece of clothand about 7 lbs of silver. Also gold worth approximately Is.700/- kept with me by certain urabs as a mortgage. All these articles were missing from this iron safe. I again made a search in the shop ana fauna the lock of the inner door of the shop broken.mm ^ 2 ^ I lookea at the northern aoor whivh is inside the market and which was bolted with three rings from inside and one ring down and locked from outsine. I found the ring which was down broken and the lock missing. On seeing what was done to my shop, I askea Jawad bin naji T Abdul Husain al Haidarabadhi whose shop was near my shop to come ana then I went to Jethanad, Shaikh Ghulum ! Abbas Lari, Mukht&amp;r bin Hasan al Haidarabadi, Juma T h bin Muhammad and Khalifah bin Limas and requested them to come to my shop wnich they did. They witnessed tha affair and then all of us went into the inner shop the lock of which was broken. In this shop there was an iron safe belonging to Kaiso which was found broken and its contents not known. I atonce left these people in the shop and went to the Residency Agency, at Sharjah. As Khan Sahib Husain was not present at Sharjah, I went to T Abdur Rahman bin Husain and reported the fact to him. He came to mys hop and witnessed the affair. Then he asked me to go with him to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah which I dia. I informed the Shaikh about the whole incident. He at once went to the shop with T Abaur Rahman and saw with his own eyes the broken iron safes ana the broken rings of the shop. As my shop is situated within the market and as I * pay watching fees monthly in the usual way ana as the watch men watch the market ana no such incident has ever taken place in my shop, I request the High Rritish Government to have my things recovered from the thieves.(7.U Translation. Statement of Jethanand, Shaikh Ghulum f Abbas, Mukhtar bin Hasan, Juma T h bin Muhammad ana Khalifah bin Dimas. «ve, the undersigned, do hereby state that at 5 0 T clock on Saturaay the 11th Muharram 1355 (5.3.1936) Dhaman Bunia came to us, told us that theft took place in his shop and requested us to go and see it. We went with him. 7fe found that the rings which were inside the shop broken and the iron safe which was placed in the godown of the T Amarah which faces towards the sea was broken. Dhaman alleged that the said iron safe belonged to Kaiso Bunia who had its key. The safe which was placed at the opening of the shop was open. We askea him whether the third safe was broken open or not. He said that if this safe was broken too, he would have finished. We askea him what was missing from the broken safe. He said that a sum of Rs.42l/, 17 or 16 tolas of gold ana casts of silver. The gowdown which faces the desert was locked. He said that this goaown was not broken open and its key was lost some days ago ana that the big iron safe was kept in it. That if this goaown ana the iron safe were broken open, he would have been finished. v&lt;e left Dhaman in his shop and returned to our places. In the afternoon, by the order of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr ana T Abdur Rahman bin Husain we went on the spot ana inspected the iron safe which was not touched by the thieves but did not see anything therein which he(Dhaman) said, me, however, found two silver anklets ana two gold rings.

I have been in Sharjah since the last three years and a half, i used to watcn in the market at night and during the day I used to work with the Agent of the ^il Company at Sharjah, nearly seven or eight times within a period of fifteen days 1 saw Lhaman the Bunia going down at night from his room to his shop and sometimes when he used to do so, I used to hear a slight noise from inside ths shop sucn as the moving of some metal pots. On hearing such noise I used to ask him what he was doing and he used to reply sometimes that he had work there and sometimes that he wanted to sleep in the shop. The rest of the Katchmen also told me the same thing. On the 8th Muharram (2.3.36; in the afternoon Dhaman proceeded to nubai, spent one night there ana then came back to Sharjah, ^fter his return from Dubai, it was said that a theft took place in his shop. After two days Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr’s servant came to me anu took me to the Shaikh who asked me about the theft which took place in the shop of Dhaman. I told him as above and added that I know nothing about the theft and that no thief came to the market so that I may see him. That we, the watchmen, did not neglect our duty so as to allow such incidents to take place in the market. The Shaikh insisted on me and l brought forth excuses for him but he consequntly passed orders that I should be imprisoned. Had I known who was the thief 1 would have informed Shaikh Sultan about him. i felt, however, something untoward out of bhaman T s entering his shop at night through i,, the small door which is in the Al ihairab market at which there was not any guard? and also by the slight noise wnich could be heard from the shop.warnf J Translation of the statement of Ibrahim bin Hasan Zarawni. S e ven months ago I came to Sharjah in order to earn for my livelihood. When I arrived at Sharjah I hired a shop in the ’Shinaseyah’ market and started making bread for a period of four months. 0 n seeing that I was not making any profit out of this business, 1 closed the shop and entered into service as a natur in the Sharjah market. The head watchman pays me Rs.5/- per month. This is the third month that T entered the service. Nearly three or four times within a period of fifteen days I saw Dhaman the Sonia, going do n at night from his room to his shop through the southern small door. Sometimes I used to hear slight noise from inside the shop such as the moving of some copper pots . Whenever I used to hear this noise I used to ask Dhaman what he was doing in the shop and he used to tell us that it was not our business to ask him and that he wanted to sleep. Sometimes he used to say that he had some business in his shop. On nth Muharram (5.3.36) in the afternoon I heard that theft took place in the shop of Shaman.

To, Tne secretary to the Honourable tne Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 3 U S H i R h* Memorandum. Subject: Claims on the Trucial Coast. Would yoi/^lease refer to tne enclosure to your printed letter No.940 dated the 28th April 1930. This Agency has at tne moment on its files outstanding claims on the Truciai Coast to a total amount of is.35,627/-, maue by five different persons. The investigation of these claims, necessarily devolves on the Residency &lt;r*gent, Onarjah. 2. While it is admitted that we are the proper authority to assist British subjects in their dealings with Trucial subjects, it seems nevertheless that the Residency Agent, Oharjah, is regarded by some people as a convenient debt-collecting agency. 3. Recent and expected developments on the Trucial Coast are occupying the Residency Agent witn work which can leave him little time for tbe laborious investigations involved by these comparatively unimportant matters. 4. a case in which it appears tnat definite injury has been done to a Britisn subject, such as the looting of Mohandas Dhamanmai’s shop mentioned in the letter under reference, is entirely different, and i do not for a moment suggest tnat we should overlook cases of this sort. But we might well, I think, refuse in future to consideri - 0 v, any cases of recovery of dekt on the Trucial Coast, in which the element of injury does not appear. 5. British subjects might then be more careful in the aisposl of their money in this area, ana we might avoid friction between British and Trucial subjects, as well as the appearance of interfering in the ohaikhs* internal affairs. 6. 1 should be grateful if you would ascertain the Resident’s views on this point.

Bince it is known to us that he (.Ali) is not separate from him (.his father) the camel is not his property but it is the property of his father. By this allegation he hopes to get the price of the camel. Syed Bhahab bin Faisal has written me in this connection and I have replied that the son of Budhaffar has no plea to raise against us and in good health he alleged that the camel belonged to him and not to his father and that Syed Shahab could recover the money from the Wali Ludhaffar and pay it to his son Ali. Again he sent letters to me asking me to pay the money to Ali bin iiidhaffar raising an argument that Iwudhaffar was not indebted to me and that my claim against him (Mudhaffar) was settled during the time of Byed Taimur. Besides this he added threats saying that if 1 did not pay the money he would surely treat us in a similar manner. Since there is no illfeeling between us I tried to settle the matter amicably but could not be successful. :! i'A 1 successful, in view of the existing friendship between me and the government of mscat I preferred not to follow his suit and considered it better to fllesist from corres pondence with him and to refer the matter to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with the request that he will kindly recover the money through the government of mi sc at by which act any trouble arising between ma and my dear friends will be avoided. 1 again repeat my request and hope that you will help me in this matter.

At Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait, where we have orders in Council, one of the main duties of the Political Agent is to adjudicate on claims of British subjects against local inhabitants. The fact that we have no Order in Council on the Trucial Coast does not diminish the duties of our representa tive there, the Residency Agent, to pursue the same policy, though the method employed may have to be different. 3d/- T.C.

Haim of Mr. Kish and as Nathamai of Tatta (Hni) against Byat hin Muhammad of :n Duhai. * I'M / / _ nr/vpy 2kKarachi, 16th February 1937 From*- Hassaram Jashanraal, Esquire, B.A. LLB, Advocate Bunder Road, extension, Karachi To, The Foreign Secretary, Government of India, D S L H I Sir, I have the honour, on behalf of my client Mr* Kishindas Nathamal of Tatta, (Sind) to bring to your kind notice the following facts with a sanguine hope that you will be pleased to extend your kindness to my client in getting him his dues which you alone can do. It was in Rabi-ul-Sani 1345 (i.e. about November 1926) that accounta*-tr of dealings between my client Kishindas Nathamal and one Byat Bin Mahomed of Dubai having been settled, an amount of Ps. 19400/-/- (Rupees Nineteen Thousand Four hundred) was found due by Byat Bin Mohomed to my client for which the former passed an Acknowledgement dated 16th Rabi-ul-Sani 1345 (translation hereto attached) promising to pay back Ps. 10000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) in Shawal 1345 (about April 1927), Ps. 5000/-(Rupees Five Thousand) in Gufal (Diving period) in the month of Rabi-ul-Sani 1346 (i.e. about October 1927), and the balance of Ps. 4400/-/- (Rupees four thousand four hundred in Gafal 1347 (i.e. by end of 1928). The said Acknowledgement as you will be pleased to note was also signed and sealed by cousin and brother-in-law of the debtor viz: Syed Bin Muktoom the Chief of Dubai as Surety. At the time of the settlement of accounts, a good portion of pearls of the debtor was ia-W custody of my clients’ firm which my client was going to detain towards his ttebt, but the same was released on the reouest of Syed Bin Muktoom the Chief, of his standing surety. Knowing the Surety as a very rich party and fully confiding in him because of his being the Chief of Dubai and a great Landlord having an yearlyyearly income of over two lacs of rupees from wharfage fees as well Boat and pearl fees, my client fully relied upon him and released the pearls of Byat Bin Mohomed. The chief I am instructed to say paid Ks# 8000/-/- (Rupees eight thousand) instead of Fs. 10000/-/- as first instanlent, but later on in all these years he has paid only Es* 28000/-/- leaving a balance of Fs. 8600/-/- (Rupees eight thousand six hundred). It is very surprising that a gentleman of his position should so delay for years in paying the debt which he promised to pay within three years. Finding it hard to recofer the balance of which my client has not only been losing interest but is unable to utilise the same in trade purposes, which would have brought him good profit, he applied a number of times viz: on 5th April, 1st June, 20th J^ne, 18th July and 16th August 1935 to the Honourable Resident in Persian Gulf and Consul General of H.jf. Majesty Bushire but with no hopeful results. Thereon ho even applied to H.B.Majesty’s political Agent Bahrein on 15th November 1935 and again on 12th November 1936. It is unfortunate that though a lojtal British Indian subject he is being thus neglected and nothing has been done to get him his dues from a foreign chief. Naturally my client has to look for help upon the British Indian Government. It is not that the chief is poor and cannot pay, or is it that there is any other objection, but my client feels that because he cannot continuously remain in the foreign land which he visits only during the pearl season, that the Chief Syed Bin Maktoom evidently feels himself secure, not perhaps knowing that he can get full help from the British Indian Government. My client has by this time su 'fered a very great loss of interest and even the profit which he could have made by putting this large amount of Fs, 8600/0 in some trade. I therefore, on his behalf, have the honour to approach you with .......'—-—^—■ with a request that you will be pleased to iseue such instructions as you deem fit* to the Political Agent Bahrein or Consul General at Bushire to see that the said amount may be recowered from the Chief of Dubai Syed Bin Muktoom and remitted either to my client at Tatta (Sind) or to me here. Jn conclusion I must thank you in anticipation feeling that this is not a difficult t&amp;£k, as once before even about 4 or b years back I had the fortune to apply to you with success.

Reference your printed letter No. 235 dated 31st August^ 1940. In the month of July 1936 Jagunal Dhamanmal left Sharjah xor Dubai where he opened a business for the purchase of gold.and its export outside. He had no money for the business and nothing else except the help of a liindu merchant at Dubai known as Badanmal through whom he sends his gold exports to Bombay therefore some merchants were fihus misled and began to deal with him in accordance with the usual practice of selling him gold and paying him cash and receiving from him hundis drawn on India. After forty nays o^ nractice he began to put off his creditors by false^ promises and was ut to that time indebted to some merchants to the extent Ox Rs. 6680/10. .'/hen his creditors pressed for payment he pretended sickness and gave false promises. Thus the trick became apparent to the public. Therefore his creditors wrote a petition to the Ruler of XDubai, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, in which they prayed that the necessary steps may be taken xor the recovery oi their rights which were paid to him less than 20 days^bexore. His books were immediately attached by the Ruler of Dubai who asxeu . me to prevent him from leaving until he settles^the matter with m creditors. On examinations of his books it was found that he nad Rs. 3385/13 of which Rs. 2916/13 isx with Badhanmal. After some discussion and arguments and through mediation of some inxluential Hindu merchants an arbitration committee of three persons was formed to find means of settlement between Dhamanmal Jagunal and his creditors. This was arrived at in accordance with the enclosed arbitration aw r ard dated 14th September 1936 according to whicn he had to pay to his creditors half the amount due, this was made up by the amount which he had, and to pay an instalment of As. 2 per rupee after three months and As. 3 per rupee after six months, his creditors having agreed to forego the rest . 2 . In the beginning of February 1940 he asked me for permiss ion to go for 15 days to be present at the marriage of his daughter and to return but I asked him to bring me a letuer xrom his creditors that they have no objection about the matter but he d did not do so. On 12th February he went to the Political Officer and asked him for permission but when he.learnt about the.case he gave him the same reply but when he presisted in aswing nis Permission the Political Officer gave him a persona^ letter to the , Agent of Shaikh Mustafa bin Abdul Latif of Dubai but the latter die not agree to his departure before he makes some arrangement about the debt due to him. 3 # in the end of July some Hindus came.to me and.showed me the document which he enclosed in his petition and said^ that t^e, want Dhamanmal to leave for India and that they have asked Abdulla^ Murad, the Agent of Shaikh Mustafa bin Abduli Latif to sign the document but he did not agree. The reason for the refusal of Shaikh Mustafa’s agent is that he asked Damanmal to give him a deed agreeing that he has the right to sue him in Bombay or anywhere else for the recovery of his right from him whenever he is in a/position to pay but Dhamnmal wants finally to be iree Ox this debt most of which is due to Shaikh Mustafa bin Abdul Latif. | as may be observed from the list of his creditors enclosed herewit; ' The total amount due to the persons.who had signed the document which he enclosed in his petition is Rs. 640/^/9, 4 # His allegation about the debts due to him is old and the debts are due from the time K.B. Isa bin Abdul Latif. wnen he informed me at the time I took over charge of the Agency I did all I could to help him, and he had dxa a debt due from a bankrupt of Rs. 2070/- which is the sum mentioned in his petition but the bankrupt owed one mortagaged vessel only but I got it. free from the mortgage for him and suggested to him several times to find a buyer for it so that he may sell it and pay his credit- tors but he did not do so and the boat remained in rums and decayed and its value depricicates everyday that passes and I do not think it will fetch more than a small sum now. 5 . You are aware of the present condition of the Trucial coast and how difficult it ix‘was to recover debts even in those days when people were rich and prosperous, and about the Rulers’ k h Y S | ^ lifj\ ■/~N - 2 - inability to recover the rights of others and how they support their subjects by every means. Then how would they be in such circumstances as the present in which coast is passing through great financial difficulties which caused extreme poverty and misfortune to most families whose rich has become poor and in a starving condition ? had 6 . During the past years Dhamanmal several times spoken with the Political Agent when he comes here but it was not possible to do anything for the recovery of his old debts which are owed in Sharjah only. U.E. k ^- e ^^ er dated (nil.) from the undersigned oersons to the Ruler of Dubai. After compliments, . , th ® undersigned, beg to state that a sum of Rs. 6,680/10 as due t° us from the Hindu Dhamanmal bin Jagumal and Badhan, some ol wnicn is tne value of gold and some paid in cash for Hundis on ' ornbay. At present it appears that these persons do not want to pay at all because a few days ago we discussed the matter with w tnem and obey made several false and baseless allegations but we iicive reliable evidence against them and it is apparent now that tney have agreed between themselves to devour the rights of others • because they have opened this trading business about ~45 da^s ago and secondly.because this money is due from them since 20 days' only, and this can be considered as a criminal act. We therefore request you to do the needful for the recovery of our rights by all means at your disposil and as soon as possible because this is an odvious harm not only against us but against all the oeople of ' tne town because if this has not been checked and the amount recovered immediately it will shake confidence of trust in business transactions and consequently all business will stop and this will no doubt have a harmful effect on the state Government. Therefore ne request that the matter may kindly be dealt with immediately anc. the xull amount recovered without delay or arguments for the sake of the common good. The amount due is composed of the following To Shaikh Mustafa bin Abdul Latif To Muhammad Sharif and Abdulla Shamsuddin To Ratanchand Tarachand To Baghwandas Maghanmal do Abdul Rahim al Haj Abdul Rahman To Dhamanmal Keshowdas Rs. 1960/- ' 1862/4 ' 1877/6 ' 533/5 ' 300/- ' 147/11 Total Rs. 6680/10 Sd.

Salih had in his pocket pearls and some gold ornaments of which he had no information. The Shaikh says that the aggressor should be punished for the assault he has done and that the question of the articles taken from Salih requires Shara’ decision; and only if anything is proved against the aggressor Muhammad,will be considered. The messenger thus returned without reaching at a final settlement. Then I personally went to the Shaikh to Ras-el-Khaimah and there we had a lengthy discussion regard ing the said matter. i said to him,”as the man was beaten until he fell swooned on the ground,it is sure that Salih was the cause of his loss”. The Shaikh replied that he will refer the matter to Shara’. I enclose a paper of evidence regarding the pearls which Salih had. I also enclose, for your perusal, a letter sent to me by one Salim bin Abdullah bin Chalban of Ras-el-Khaimah who had witnessed the assault, and a paper showing the things missing from Salih, Copies of all these letters have Iffeen sent to the Shaikh who is not agreeable but to refer the matter to Shara 1 ; whereas Salih does not agree to go to Sfyara' because the Shara' of our side are Najdis and prove/- ,n / &lt;*** 2 .

The victim Salih tin Udul La tip v*u3 so badly beaten that he Painted and Pell On the ground. There were in the pocket op the afore** said Salin pearls and some gold ornaments which were taken while ne was lying unconscious. The Shaikh says that he would inflict the punishment of beating for □eatingi but as Par the articles toAen Prom Salih it was a matter Per the Shara to decide and that if Tiuhammad was proved guixty he would be punished, accordingly. Thus came back the messenger without any sex,tie- merit. Then I personally went to has ul Fhaimah tc discuss tn^ matter with the Shaikh.

It, however, appeared that the Shaikhs had been demanding irom the debtor and, with a great difucult the Shaikh got some gold ornaments which were handed over to Dharamdas. The question of the recovery of the balance,ie., Rs.3000/- was to be taken up. Shaikh Sai f a is sparing no effort m this matter but the debtor is in a very straitened circumstance. In the past diving season his boat got no catch even to meet his fresh debt. The landed property of the debtor has been mortgaged to some of the merchants by the Shaikh for Rs.oOOO/-, the amount which was first paid to the said Dharamdas. On account of the lack of income out ol the Giving, the Arabs are lacing a great problem towards paying their debts and especially m this hard time. The two Shaikhs said that they would not leave the matter like this, but they hope to get the amount and pay it off. This is what they said to me. 1 would not neglect to demand tne same and hope to get it shortly.
