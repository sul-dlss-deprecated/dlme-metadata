Moussa Kadim Effendi, the newly appointed Mutessarif of Montefik, has arrived at Nassriyeh. The vali visited Suk-es-Shiyukh, Nassriyeh, and Shattra, and held meetings of the Arab sheikhs. Prayers were said over the graves of the soldiers killed in conflict with the Arabs. The sheikhs undertook to pay tithes for the years 1325 and 1326 ; to keep the routes open; and to restore the Mauser rifles taken from the soldiers. I hear twelve rifles have been returned. Some of the sheikhs gave written undertakings in these matters. They declared their submission to the Ottoman Government. A commission has been formed to ascertain the damages and losses to the people of Shattra from the Arab attacks. The vali seems optimistic, and expressed himself satisfied with the results of his visit. He informed my Russian colleague that Turkey had no better subjects than the Arabs of Montefik. I learn from other sources that the measures taken will be useless, as the Arabs will not listen to their sheikhs. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW. [2853 p-1] COPY TO INDIA c? 191 ?

I HAVE the honour to enclose translations of some documents which I have obtained from the Arabic translation department of the Porte and which I have good reason to suppose are genuine. They are written by the committee correspondents and adherents in the Yemen, and in a way are in the familiar strain of suspicion of England and her alleged designs in Arabia. As is well known, the Arabs in general were bitterly disappointed when, some time after the revival of the constitution and after the committee captured the Government of the Ottoman Empire, they discovered that it was guided by Turkification tendencies instead of the decentralisation ideas which they expected, and which they hoped would allow the free development of the different divisions of Arabia under the aegis ot the Ottoman Government. Many of them now declare that the binding link of the Caliphate has disappeared and that it is now solely a question of Arab versus lurk while many of them who have been brought into contact with or had experience of British methods in Egypt, Aden, India, and the Gulf have begun to develop leanings towards Engknd as closed to^the Turk ^ to admit that the?e centrifugal tendencies are the result of their unconstitutional and unsympathetic attitude towards the Arabs and other races, endeavour to persuade themselves and others that they are due to English machinations, while their correspondents reflect this mental attitude 1 nervousness of Stamboul about the Caliphate was a feature of the ex-Sultan sYildiz government, and has apparently been intensified with the present rders of Turkey, whose free-thinking ways have alienated the deeply religious ra pop ' • present Khedive, who is reputed to be friendly to England, not unnaturally comes m ''‘SZiSZr. *.

Substance of a Letter in Arabic, purporting to be in ^ by his First Secretary Chiefs of Egypt, which was sent to the Sultan and forwarded oy to the Grand Vizierate. • j THE object of the Christian Powers of Europe is to cndsli the to take from it the Caliphate. The Moslem emirs mid chiete^mst^o 8 [2817 d —3] \ COPY TO INDIA 91 ,&lt;Z - „ r- -r A 0\/&gt;0 MOto shoulder to serve the Empire, are seen to be seditious and treacherous m all their actions. In spite of the benefits they have received, they are ungrateful and are the instruments for the destruction of the Empire. Since becoming Khedive, Abbas Hilmi Pasha has never ceased striving to break off relations with the Government to which he is subject and to cast off his allegiance. is being drawn into this path by a foreign hand, the object being to establish an Arab Sultanate In the old regime there were many who had prepared the way for this, but the new order of things is not favourable for the execution of such schemes. The possibility of the separation of Egypt and other Arab countries near it, such as Hedjaz, from Turkey should not be forgotten. To accomplish this the Khedive uses his position rather than force. He has lately sent his cousin, Aziz Pasha Husm (? Hassan), to the desert Arabs, and a person named Abdul Rahmi-al-KaA akibi to Mecca. ^ He lias also sent special officials to Aden, Yemen, and Irak, and at English instigation he has also dispatched men to Tripoli, in Africa, with regard to the extension of the railway. Seeing the glory of the Caliphate established by the constitution, the Khedive thought to gain the object on which he had spent so much money by going to Mecca on the pretence of making the pilgrimage. He had conversations with the Arab chiefs and prolonged his journey to Syria and Palestine. The Arab Caliphate and the Sultanate of Egypt will stretch from the deserts of Aleppo to Tehame and Yemanffi on the north, and from the Persian frontier to Irak, from Oman to Tripoli, in Africa, on the south, and will be under the protection of England, who rules over the larger part of the Moslem population of the world. With this object in view, the Khedive recently sent his brother, Mehmed Ali Pasha, on a secret mission to Damascus, Aleppo, and Beirout. In a speech he made to the Arab notables, he said how glad he was to visit Damascus and the surrounding country which his ancestors made into a paradise. This speech was published in No. 6398 of the Arabic newspaper “ A1 Mukattam.” The Khedive passes his time and is in relations with the reactionary Izzet Pasha and his satellites. These traitors to their religion and their country are made use of for the foimiation of the Khedive’s Arab Caliphate, and the newspaper U A1 Moayyad, published in Egypt, has been chosen to propagate their views. The Ka’aba (sacred tomb at Mecca) is thus menaced by England through the formation of an Arab-Egyptian Empire. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Translation of a Letter in Arabic, dated 28 Rebi-ul-ewel, 1328 (April 9, 1910), from Seyyid Mahmoudr-bin-Mohammed-al-Harazi, one of the Seyyids and Shereefs of Sanaa, in the Yemen, to the Grand Vizierate. THE chief cause of the dissatisfaction in the Yemen is the fact that the salaries and pay, which have long been paid to the seyyids and shereefs of the Yemen by the Yemen imams, have not been given by the Ottoman Government. These heart-broken shereefs and seyyids are of the greatest assistance to the imam. From a letter I have received I learn that Imam Yahya is desirous of showing his loyalty and stretching out the hand of friendship to the Government, but that he is vexed because the Government does not favour his present demands. All the Government officials in the Yemen are scoundrels and oppressors. They understand no service but that which promotes their personal advantage. In order to conceal their wickedness, these officials say that the country is in perfect order ; but that is a lie, and is just to deceive the Government. If there is perfect order in the Yemen, why does the Government send £ T. 40,000 there every month ? Let the rulers of the Empire open their eyes, for the efforts and intrigues of England are many. The people are poor; they are oppressed by want; they are ready to break out into riot and rebellion. The power and influence of Seyyid Idris increase daily, and it is confidently expected that he will surpass the imam. His men travel about in the Hedjaz and in Mesopotamia, and he is in constant communication with Egypt. It is certainly England who is helping and serving him materially and morally with a strong hand. To repair this grave and disastrous situation the Government needs men rather than money ; for the Govern ment money is not spent on the country and on the progress and prosperity of the people by the vile hands of the officials, who are devoted to their greedy personal interests, and no good results. If things go on like this, the Yemen will break off completely from the Empire, and Irak and the Hedjaz will follow at once. I would call3 your attention to the contents of this my fourth letter. If no sign is shown of taking the steps required, I shall give no more advice and service in this way. I am, &amp;c. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Translation of a Letter in Arabic, dated April 29, 1326 (May 12, 1910), from “ Saadoun-ai-MansourT Chief of the Tribes of Muntefik, to the Grand Vizierate. WE thought we had good reason for expecting that the proclamation of the constitution would completely destroy the despotic regime and would spread justice, and we had strong hopes that under the blessed constitutional regime the Government would hasten to destroy the causes of the disputes and strife that are so apt to burst into flame in Syria and Irak and would gladden all hearts by their just actions. To leave the kaza of Koweit, the key of Irak, in the hands of that protegti of England, Mubarak Assabah, looks like weakness and impotence. In order to carry out his rebellious aims and wishes, Mubarak Assabah used-Abd-ul-Aziz Assoud, the Wahabi, as his instrument. In order to seize and plunder our goods and possessions, the said Abd-ul-Aziz Ass’oud attacked my tribes with a large, well-armed force. Heaven be praised that through our sincere desire to serve the Government we won a victory over him. After this great defeat Abd-ul-Aziz Ass’oud went to the Bussorah Government, which received them and showed them a place to dwell in. To enable Abd-ul-Aziz and his brigands to attack us again they are being strengthened with guns and other munitions of war by the Bussorah Government, and it is certain that as soon as they have collected all the stores and munitions they will attack us. Although, with the help of God, they do not matter, I would draw your attention to the fact that the present officials of Bussorah and Irak are aiding and helping their subversive move ments. For these Wahabis regard as unbelievers all Moslems who do not accept their creed, and the ulema of the Nejd, being also Wahabis, give the Wahabis fetvas, saying that the goods and lives of non-Wahabis are lawful spoil. I therefore beg that the officials of Bussorah and Irak will hasten to prevent the spreading of disorder and rebellion of Mubarak Assabah, who does nothing but serve as a tool to the invasion ol England, and of other sedition-mongers of the same kind. i. am, o&amp;c. * Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Translation of a Letter in Arabic, dated 22 Rehbi-ul-Akhir, 1328 (May 2, 1910), from Mohammed-al-Arif, Chief and Sheikh of the Ismaiha Tribe m the Yemen, to Seyyid Yahya-al-Kubssi, Notable of Sanaa. I THINK it my duty to tell you this, for the matter is gradually moving towards discovery and difficulty. The English Government pretends to 110 fin ^ r Yemen and imam question, but it is known that k°tli lens an e ^ - Hamid-ed-Din strive to promote the aims of England. ^ rp, • machine from England so that he can strike coins, throng t e mn T r p, machine has just arrived at Aden and will shortly be dehvere o raa Answer to Emir of Lahj told me this when he came to visit me while I was at Aden m a my question. The imam wants independence, but the course of events shows that the Seyyid Idris will surpass the imam. For Seyyid Idris is a J lls tlI b , v infidels' whereas the imam is severe and oppressive. The 11 ^ am ca ® • re k e Uion and and makes attacks on their honour lawful; yet a oug much influence and insubordination to this extent, he has been unable o acqun years ao-o has power as he desired. But Seyyid Idris, although he appeare y notables won the affections of all the imam’s supporters and partisans of all the notables, leaders, and common people of the ^““^“jji^eommunity of Haraz (district near of beyyid Idris is one to be obeyed.

During the GrarA Vizierate of Hussein Hilmi Easha, the late vali, Kiamil Hey (now \ali of Hedjaz), received cypher instructions to investigate and watch the relations and correspondence between the Arab notables and chiefs. As a result of his investigations it became clear and proved that the Emir of Lahj had been appointed by England as an intermediary among the Arabs; our present researches have shown that the English Government makes presents and allowances to the Emir of Mecca, Mubaiak Assabah, Ibn fteshid, and other Arab notables, through the Emir of Lahj. According to repeated informa tion of a reliable nature, the Arab notables and leaders will make an alliance for their independence, and will resolve to form an Arab Caliphate. It is worth noting that Imam Yahya Hamid-ed-Din is in correspondence with the Emir of Lahj, and that Seyyid Mohammed Ashsherif has selected Lahj as his place of residence.39 !!

Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Monahan to Sir G. Lowther. [My reason for making the enclosed “ private and confidential ” is that I think it should never be seen by any Mussulman, and all the staff of this consulate are Mussulmans.—J. H. M.] (Private and Confideiitial.) Sir, Jeddah, June 7, 1910. WITH reference to my despatch No. 12, Confidential, of the 12th March, 1909, I have the honour to submit the following observations on the condition of the Hedjaz under the parliamentary regime. The condition of the province now differs little from its condition under the old regime, except that pilgrims continue to suffer much less extortion. In the proceedings of Parliament hardly any interest is taken. In and about Jeddah there were in the winter and spring of 1908-9 some signs of awakening. Some sportsmen, both natives and Europeans, used to go out shooting to considerable distances, soldiers used to go out for firing practice, and a Jeddah news paper was started with a Syrian Christian, an energetic young man, as editor. But before the winter of 1909 the newspaper had died a natural death, the Bedouins had again become dominant, almost up to the walls, and the old half-mile walk to the northward between the barracks and the arm of the sea had again become, as it still remains, the only exercise that could be safely taken outside the town. The Bedouins have now become perhaps more dangerous than ever, as they^ have audaciously recaptured, just outside the town, eleven negro slaves whose liberation the Butish and French consulates had just obtained, and as the Ottoman Government has consequently ordered that no slaves of Bedouins are for the present to be liberated (see my despatches No. 15 of the 22nd May and No. 16 of the 26th May,^ 1910). _ About the slave trade, which is not openly carried on m Jeddah, I do not know much except that it is still flourishing. . r, ■ ^ A municipality was set up in Mecca last September for the rs nne. 1S ™ e work of the Mecca “ Committee of Union and Progress,” a secret body of about fifty members, Turkish officers and Turks settled in the town, and is opposed by the grand shereef, from whom it has taken for itself the tithe on dates, fruit, \ege a es, an re wood. It has imposed a tax for lighting and cLaning of about 2,9. a )eai on eac i louse, and has hung up some hundreds of petroleum street-lamps. ^ ^ ecca ma} per aps e really progressing a little.

They are now sometimes to be seen indulmmr • wrestling and ungainly dances. There is much drilling in the early morning thoLk bring practice has been almost entirely stopped; and every afternoon and”eveniL there are performances of the atrocious military band. Since Bedouins attacked ? pilgrim caravan almost at the gates of Jeddah last October, soldiers have been posted t the gates and some streets. One comes to cry out “ Kimdiro ? ” (“ Who is that ? ”1 w en any one passes in the night. A harmless negro who did not understand these lurkish words is reported to have been shot dead last winter.

Some account of education in the Hedjaz seems of possible interest. Under the auspices of Vali Ahmed Kalib Pasha, the Government free boys’ school of Jeddah, which should include a preparatory (“ ibtidai ”) school and a primary (“ rushdi ”) ^hool, almost ceased to exist, and there were no other places of education in the town, except the usual little Koran-gabbling schools for very young children. Five years ago public-spirited persons, including some British Indians, set up a school on the same lines as those laid down for the Government school, but charging fees for pupils of the well-to-do class. This school, called the “ felah ” (prosperity) school, has prospered exceedingly, having now seven masters and about 250 pupils. Its present head master, a Syrian, travelled with me from Suez to Jeddah last October. I overheard him discoursing to some Turkish fellow-travellers about the civilising power of Islam, and giving them an exaggerated account of the Denshawai affair. He was loud and ostentatious in the performance of the formalities known as Mussulman prayers. The Government free school has had, since its opening, or rather reopening, five months ago, generally about 90 pupils, but should have about 200 when it reopens again next August with its full complement of five teachers. I may mention that one of the teachers, a British Indian, was recently dismissed for his corrupting misconduct, which is very common here, with some of the boys. He does not, however, seem to have lost caste, and is now often coming to this consulate about some business of his. The curriculum in the “ felah ” and Government schools is as follows : Much time is given to the literary Arabic language, of which the literature is dead, and the literary and official Turkish, :i: ' which has, perhaps, never had a literature ; also to “ religion,” of which promising students go afterwards to follow the course of old Moslem religious-juristic scholasticism, which is still flourishing in the courtyards and colonnades of the great mosque at Mecca. History of the Ottoman Empire, geography, and arithmetic are also taught, and there is some talk even of French being hereafter included. There are in Mecca two or three large schools in which much the same instruction is given, and one in Taif, and there is said to be a rather superior school in Medina. There seems to be practically no education for girls in the Hedjaz. Such is the education obtainable, and it is not satisfactory. But very few parents or pupils wish to seek a better elsewhere, and indeed I am not sure that there is any much better to be had in Moslem boys schools elsewhere in the Turkish Empire. The inhabitants of Jeddah are closely attached to their noisome and rat-infested it stately and generally reposeful town. The easily obtained slave-girls are no doubt a a bond of attachment. When one of them bears a child she is, I understand, inalienable by Mussulman law, and should also be set free so that she may be married to her master or some one else. This state of things may not please the lawfu wi e, or the master, or perhaps even the slave-girl herself, who, if she becomes free an d a lawful wife, is then exposed to the perfectly capricious divorce, and accordingly the procuring of abortion, in the case of slave-girls, is quite a common prac ice, ^ suppose more common and less disapproved here than else^ here. ur er,^ ere is the comforting belief that each performance of the short and easy pi gnmage o Mecca wipes out all past sins.

SINCE submission to your Excellency from Jeddah at the beginning of last month of mv report on the progress of the Arab revolt in the I ehama, and since my return to Hodeidah, the rebel tribesmen have practically shown no activity. While there has been nothing very important to report in the way of fighting during the past two months, it has been difficult to understand what has actually been happening since the large force, consisting of about 7,000 regulars drawn fiom the 1st, Hnd, Illrd, and IVth Army Corps, and of nearly 4,000 recruits, has been landed at Hodeidah to deal with the revolt in the Yemen. t General Rifaat Pasha, who has fully 4,000 trained men under his command, and several guns, and who established his base at Loheia at the end of September, advanced on Zahra, some eight hours’ march from his base, and has since occupied Zaidyia, t at is, another eight hours’ march northward, during the two months that have elapse . He has met with no opposition whatever during his mo\ements, most o t le numerous sheikhs inhabiting the country round about immediately coming in to announce t leir submission. . , i x *i The villages of other sheikhs and tribesmen that have not submitted voluntarily have been burned by the troops. , i* t?i tj - u Communication between Hodeidah or Loheia and the distnc s o El-Hujjur has been entirely cut off for the past three or fout mon s, a ou £y * . expected that the strong force under Rifaat Pasha would ha\e succee e ei establishing the necessary communication. tvi- x ^ Much dissatisfaction prevails at the inactivity shown y 1 aa xi i x i xi country north of Hodeidah. The vilayet at the beginning o tns non existing and mutessarif of Hodeidah to visit Loheia to ascertain the real state of aftans ex s g to report what Rifaat Pasha was doing. Q x T nnc ,o Pf i Nedjib Pasha, the mutessarif, after a stay of seventeen days at Loheia, passed through Camaran last week on his way back to Hodeida i. &lt; ii hoard the f inferred from a conversation that I had with his “^'^0 and Ottoman gun-boat “Naushahr” here that Rifaat Pasha, owing to mwmpetenc^ and want of experience, is still inert at Zaidyia, whereas the foice 1 sufficiently strong to advance on El-Hnjjiir. summoned several sheikhs It would appear that the mutessanf, while at Loheia,^ ^“h risee of gabyeah from the surrounding districts, from whom he learnt c ^ y , £ rom gabyeah was undoubtedly the instigator of the present rising, am , ' f orce a t were sent by him to assist the Wayidat tribesmen m investing the iurkish Zahra during the months of August and Septembei as . aupinn Hadi-el-Haii, the He (the mutessarif) succeeded, with the assistance a h Mmjtir, chief of the Wayidat clans that inhabit the coun ry e v j to ; 0 ; n ; n the and who has hitherto refused the repeated overtures of the Id see j rebellion, in pushing up supplies to the garrison sta lone [2546 ee —1]There have been rumours afloat during the past few days that the troops under Rifaat Pasha will shortly make a forward movement and open up communication with both El-Hujjeh and El-Hujjur. While no actual encounters between the troops at the. latter places and the tribesmen are reported to have taken place, it is known that tl country intervening between the Zaidyia and the two above-mentioned districts hj infested with armed bands of rebels. As already reported, the Ottoman transport “ Nedjat ” and the ship “ Ecaterions- lawl,” of the Russian Volunteer fleet, disembarked at Hodeidah early in October 2 929 regulars under arms drawn from the first four army corps in Turkey for service in this vilayet. The above-mentioned troops under Brigadier-General Sa'id Pasha who also arrived from Constantinople at the same time were transported a week later in the ships “ Harriet ” and “ Nedjat ” to Cumfuda, to be utilised to quell the rebellion in the province of Assyr and to advance later from Abba the capital on Sabyeah, the Idrisee’s head-quarters. The sheikhs in the vicinity and those residing in the interior were invited to come down and meet Said Pasha on his arrival at Cumfuda, but refused to do so on the ground that in the absence of substantial assurances to the contrary, they feared they would be detained or imprisoned on coming in. The authorities then requested that no obstacles be placed in the way of the troops during their march towards Abha. the capital, to which the tribesmen replied that their instructions from Seyyid Mahomed-el- Idrisee were to oppose the advance of troops, but not to molest trade caravans. Makhail, a military outpost between Cumfuda and Abha, that had been captured early in September, still remains in the hands of the rebels ; and the capital, though not actually besieged, has since been cut off from communication with the coast. When he first landed at Hodeidah, General Said Pasha met a certain Abdurrahman Bey llias and a khoja named Tewfik, who produced credentials from the Ministry of the Interior, charging them to proceed to Sabyeah on a special mission to Sevvid Mahomed-el-Idrisee. . Abdurrahman Bey is an Arab by birth and the son of an Arab Pasha who is a native of Medina, where he is resident. . The Kho j a Tewfik was a fellow student of the Idrisee’s at the Azhar University in Cairo, and is well known to the Seyyid. The two men above referred to have since their arrival visited the Idrisee, who received them hospitably. They report that the Seyyid, who simply professes to be a man of piety and learning, disclaims all connection with the recent revolt and the present unrest in the Tehama of northern Yemen. According to them, the Seyyid even denies that he has ever instigated the sheikhs and tribes to rise, but, on the contrary, he avers that since his return to Yemen from Egypt about three years ago, his energies have been diverted towards putting a stop to inter-tribal warfare in his locality and the amicable and peaceful settlement of disputes between the Arabs and their sheikhs, when referred to his arbitration. I hey (the special deputies) state that Seyyid Idrisee attributes tbe present trouble principally to the oppression exercised by Boni Pasha in the Zaidyia district and to that 0 o er piominent Arabs in their respective spheres of influence in the Tehama belt, as also to the maladministration of the present Governor-General of the Yemen and the mutessarif ofHodeidah and lastly to the abuses still carried on in the cazas and cantons in the lowlands of the Yemen by the civil administrative officials. 1 ri. r p d °^ e r . nen 10ne bdurrahman Bey llias, on conclusion of his visit to Sabyeah, Interior 011 PlG ^ COmmUniCate the result of ‘ hi s mission to the Ministry of the Khoja Tewfik proceeded from Sabyeah to Cumfuda and informed Said Pasha of 18 11 h ervle y^ -p J lsee &gt; adding that the latter expressed a wish to meet him. ener a k_ai cls a lereupon left his force at Cumfuda, and accompanied by two officers and the khoja proceeded m the gun-boat “ Custumuni ” to Geezan.^ The Seyyid, 7 , non /°i l0 r rS ( accordm g to th * mutessarifs account he was • , &gt; ^ er , • i arrae ec j 0l IJ ns ) arrived and encamped at a place about twenty minutes walk outside the town of Geezan. Liwa Said Pasha, with his staff, and the khoja proceeded thither and interviewed the Pretender. The latter depicted to the general the sad state of affairs existing in this province under the administration of the vah, Hassan lahsm lash^ and the mutessarif of Hodeidah, Nedjib Pasha, and com- $*‘kh ° e oppression exercised and the abuses practised by several prominent Arab 7 th 1 e 1 l0Cal Monties in various places, in the sense already reported by the two special deputies.Seyyid Idrisee therefore advised the pasha to ask the central authorities at Con stantinople todisraiss the above-mentioned Turkish officials and to cause the removal of certain undesirable notables named by him. He further assured Said Pasha that ^should this be done, he (the,Seyyid) would answer m future for any breach of tranquility in the lehama, throughout the Yemen. ^ J It would also appear that the Idrisee stated his willingness to Said Pasha to accompany the troops from Cumfuda to Abha and to facilitate their march en route as a proof of his loyalty to the Ottoman Government and of his good faith. After his interview with Seyyid Idrisee, Said Pasha returned to Hodeidah, which he reached on the 8th instant, and has been since occupied in communicating with the Ministry of the Interior and the Grand Vizierate. It is expected that a commission will shortly be dispatched from Constantinople to the Yemen to investigate the present state of affairs and to examine the disparity of the reports submitted to the central Government by the local authorities on the one hand, and those sent by the special deputies and Said Pasha on the other. The latter, it might be mentioned, besides being appointed to command the expedition in Assyr, was delegated to report on the situation. I visited Said Pasha on board the gun-boat “ Custumuni ” here before he sailed for Geezan and Cumfuda yesterday morning. I learnt from a conversation I had with him and the Khoja Tewfik that they firmly believed the Seyyid Idrisee to be a good man and absolutely unconnected with the recent rising in the Tehama, and not at all responsible for the acts of the sheikhs and tribesmen that participated therein. Said Pasha informed me that he was going to advance almost immediately from Cumfuda on Abha and thence return to Geezan via Sabyeah. Although the general was reticent on the point when referred to by me, it is an open secret that he intends to call at Geezan and embark the Idrisee, who previously offered to accompany the troops in their advance on Abha. It is doubtful, however, whether the Seyyid will now fulfil his promise or consent to embark on an Ottoman ship of war. It is indeed difficult to reconcile oneself to the divergent views held by General Said Pasha from those of the vali of the province and of the mutessarif of Hodeidah with reference to the responsibility of Seyyid Mahomed Idrisee in the recent outbreak in the Tehama. In their communications with the central Government, the local authorities have strongly insisted, in the interests of peace and the future welfare of the province, that the rebellious tribesmen be severely punished and the Seyyid arrested and banished from the country. They are of opinion that these measures can be easily applied and executed with the force now at their disposal. They assert with equal force that they have clear and infallible evidence to prove the Seyyid’s complicity in the late insurrection. General Said Pasha, on the other hand, who has refused to treat with the local vilayet on the subject, has recommended to Constantinople a policy of leniency and conciliation towards the tribesmen, and advocates the acceptance of the proffered good offices of the Seyyid Idrisee towards the establishment of tranquility. I am personally acquainted with General Said Pasha, who has served^ pieviously in this vilayet and has a very good record. He is known to be a conscientious official and a brave, experienced, and capable commander, but I must admit that I find it difficult to accept his views. . It is possible that he has been entirely misled by the Seyyid Idnsee. but there is an even chance of mv being wrong in such a supposition. The mutessarif' of Hodeidah corroborated the information received by me as furnished in this despatch with reference to the interviews between the deputies and Said Pasha respectively and the Pretender. . , p ,, r , His Excellency explained that the Seyyid demanded the dismissal of the vah and himself, because bis impostures were too well known to them. i r xh It will be remembered that the governor-general at the commencement of the revolt issued a proclamation in Arabic, which he circulated widely amongst the Arabs in the Tehama, denouncing the Idrisee as a sorcerer and a fraud, and warning the inhabitants against being led away by his deceitful promises. At the same time, when he saw that the town of Hodeidah was in danger of falling to the onslaught of the Seyyid’s adherent, the governor with the assistance of Seyyid Ahmed Pasha Es-Sherai, an Arab notable and Mayor of Hodeidah, summoned the sheikhs of El-Khora, El-Jarabi, El-Absia, and others occupying the country in the vicinity, and made a compact with them by which the latter promised faithfully tooppose the movements of the Idrisee’s bands in their respective territories and also to assist the authorities in case of necessity. The mutessanf points out that the latter action alone saved the town of Hodeidah from being captured, as the Ottoman garrison- at the time was inadequate to protect it against the re ^ s * . - It is apparent from the explanation given by the mutessarif, and there is no doubt that it contains some truth, that the Idrisee demands the dismissal of ofhcials who were instrumental in cutting short the movement attributed to him, and the removal of those sheikhs and Arab notables that refused to make common cause with him in the upheaval of the past few months. ij-ji The near future or time alone will help to clear the mystery overclouding the political horizon in this eventful quarter of the Ottoman Empire.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from Dr. Richardson, Acting British Consul at Jeddah, reporting on the improved state of affairs in the Yemen. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Richardson to Sir G. Lowtber. (No. 48.) gj r&gt; Jeddah, September 13, 1909. I HAVE the honour to confirm my cablegram of the 5th instant reporting, on the strength of information received from the acting vice-consul at Hodeidah, that the situation in the Yemen had improved and that the state of things was quieter. The following particulars regarding the Arab rising in the Tehama, north of Hodeidah, reached me by the post a few days ago :— I am led to believe, from the accounts received from my dragoman at Hodeidah, that the rising instigated by Seyyid Mahomed-elTdrisee (wrongly called Seyyid Ali-el- Idrisee in previous reports) originated virtually with the intention on^the part of the tribesmen to crush the power and baneful influence, exercised in the Zaidyia district, of one Boni Pasha, a notorious and powerful Arab sheikh in that locality, and cannot be said to have been an organized attempt to overthrow Ottoman power and rule m the Tehama of the Yemen. 1 £ It would appear that during the month of July last, Arabs from e c ans o Beni Kais, Beni Saifan, Beni Masood, Beni-el-Abd, and Bern Hufj, inhabiting the country north of Hodeidah and between Zaidyia and LI Hujjeh, \ isitec e c usee a 'Tl^e Sheikh of Beni Hufj complained to Seyyid Mahomed about the exactions levied and illegally appropriated by Boni Pasha on camels laden wi i co and other produce en route to Hodeidah, and that traversed t e eni ory o mentioned clans. He (the sheikh) represented that his ances ors a i i , . immemorial the recognised heads of these clans, and that e ax o , 0 f be paid him, instead of to Boni Pasha, who, it may be mentioned ha the support of the Ottoman authorities that are cognisant of the exactions o\ie( y ' • f Seyyid Mahomed-el-Idrisee decided that one-third o Q ^ thrnncrh the countrv the transit dues on camels laden with merchandise and passing » ^ ^ c. inhabited by the tribesmen referred to above, should fal o other clans tribe, and that the remainder should be divided amongs e ^ ^ route leading interested, with the proviso that they would guarantee the security of the route leading to Husseih and El Hujjeh. ^ 1 , , T , • Boni Pasha from the A proclamation was then issued by the Idnsee, - nnbliqhed at Reio’a, the post of principal sheikh in the Zaidyia district, w nc i P . • 0 £ Seyyid headquarters of Boni Pasha. Tribesmen who disobeyed the injunctions se } y Mahomed-el-Idrisee were threatened with severe pun^ f he above no table store at Reiga. t * nT1 The above circumstances started the present con a^i against Boni Other tribesmen, learning of the success achieved l y ‘ e « enl f f ^ were th e Pasha’s adherents, rose and joined in the rebellion. Amongst [-4(50 s—6]2 Beni Kais, that attacked and captured Zaidyia and other towns, as has already been reported. The local authorities apparently misunderstood the object of this inter-tribal rising, and naturally took action to support the deposed and defeated Boni Pasha, whereupon the Idrisee proclaimed a “jehad against the luiks. I understand that the Arabs inhabiting the littoral between Gumfuda and Midi have declared in favour of Seyyid Mahomed, and have joined the Idrisee banner. The Turkish officials at the coastal and neighbouring inland towns that have very small garrisons are preparing to vacate their posts and proceed to Hodeidah. On the 23rd August it was reported that the Arab rebels were approaching Loheia from the north, that they had completely overrun, which caused the kaimakam of that place and other officials to quit the town, as no military assistance appeared to be forthcoming. Much anxiety existed about this time with regard to the fate of Ilodeidah, where there were barely 400 troops. The mutessarif of the district expressed the worst fears with reference to the situation when interviewed by the consular corps at Hodeidah, as it was uncertain when the reinforcements asked for would arrive from Constantinople. He seemed to approve of the action of the Italian consid-general at Hodeidah and our acting vice-consul when they intimated to him that they proposed to telegraph to their respective Governments asking that a ship of war might be sent to Hodeidah to protect the lives and property of foreigners in certain eventualities. On receiving a cablegram from Mr. Tayar informing me of the gravity of the situation in the neighbourhood of Hodeidah and of the inability of the local Govern ment to guarantee the safety of British subjects should the rebels continue their march on Hodeidah, I suggested to your Excellency that one of His Majesty’s ships of war be deputed to visit Hodeidah and watch the situation. On the 23rd August, the Turkish troops at Zahra, near Bajl, killed Shereef Mansoor, a sheikh possessing great influence in that locality, in order to prevent him from stirring the Arabs to join in the “ Idrisee ” movement. Lieutenant-Colonel Shouki Bey, who had been dispatched from Beit-el-Fakih with two battalions of infantry, drawn from different outposts in the Hodeidah sanjak, advanced via Bajl about this time, and succeeded in entering Zaidyia on the 28th August, after suffering some loss. The sheikhs of Soleil hastened to tender their submission to Shouki Bey, but demanded the banishment of Boni Pasha, who had already been recalled to Hodeidah, where he is now detained. I he Italian cruiser “ Volturno ” anchored off Hodeidah on the 25th August, having been dispatched there at the request of the local consul-general. She paid a flying visit to Sal if and Camaran, but has since returned and is lyiug in the roadstead. • a •i^ CCr ! rC ^ n ^ information received by me (communication with Hodeidah is difficult, and intelligence regarding Yemen is scanty at Jeddah) it would appear t at the backbone of the revolt in the Zaidyia district has been broken, and all anger of attack on Hodeidah or Loheia removed, at least for the present. eyyid Mahomed-el-Idrisee, on the other hand, who is eliciting the support of e popu ation m the Sabyeah district and of the tribesman inhabiting the country adjacent to the eastern Yemen littoral, is reported to be very active. 1 here is fighting going on in the Hujjeh and Hujjur cazas also, umours ave been current locally that the insurrection in the northern Yemen as ex ern e t° f e province of Assyr, and that the governor, Suleman Pasha, has een 1 ef a J a ’ ? a P lta b which is supposed to be invested by the rebels.

A success is confirmed to have been obtained by the rebels early in September, to whom two companies of infantry capitulated at Makhail, near Cumfida, with stores and ammunition.

[2460 6ft-6]/ I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.1 IN continuation of my despatch No. 48 of the 13th ultimo, I have the honour to furnish the following details of the progress of the Arab revolt under Seyyid Mahommed-el-Idrisee in the tehama of El Yemen, north of Hodeidah, that have just reached me. The situation on the 25th September was as follows : Lieutenant-Colonel Shouki Bey who, with two Yemen battalions, had retaken Zaidyia on the 26th August, was at Zohra, north of Loheia and not far from Bajl, where he had been invested by the rebels ever since. Most of the tribesmen that joined the Idrisee banner at the beginning of the revolt have now got tired, and are returning to their homes. They appear to have been deceived by the seyyid on the one hand, and have got frightened on the other at the active military preparations being made by the Turks to punish them. Besides vague accounts of fighting in the districts of El-Hujjeh and El-Hujjur, and the investment of the Turkish force at Zohra, the rebels in the tehama and along the littoral are showing no signs of any great activity on their part of late, nor have encounters between Turkish troops and themselves been reported. The sheikh of Midi and the chiefs of the minor clans of the powerful Beni Merwan tribe that inhabit the hinterland of Midi have refused to make common cause with Seyyid Mahomed against the Turks, but have requested the Hodeidah authorities to dispatch troops to their assistance in opposing the Mahdi in their territory. 1 he seaport of Loheia is being made the base of operations, where a large force with a number of guns and a quantity of ammunition and supplies and the necessary transport animals is being sent. J Ferik Bif’aat Pasha, commanding the 13th Division of the Vllth Army Corps at Sana’a, has been entrusted with the operations to be taken against the rebels, and left for Loheia in the transport “ Bizma ’Alim ” on the 23rd September. The transport “Sham” that arrived at Hodeidah from Constantinople on the 20th September with 1,400 regulars (under arms) and seventy mules embarked 150 men ot the 4th battalion of the 52nd Begiment from Jebel Reima the same day and sailed for Loheia on the 21st. She was followed by the transport “ Bizma i\.lim,’ also from Constantinople, with 1,400 regulars and 150 mules and horses, that embarked Rifaat Pasha at Hodeidah and ^ sailed for Loheia on the 23rd. A number of donkeys have also been shipped to Loheia to serve as transport. It will thus be seen that Rifaat Pasha has over 3,000 trained men under his command at Loheia, where he is mobilising and preparing to advance against the insurgents. . It is expected that a whole division of infantry, comprising six battalions t° e drawn from JSalonica, three from Adrianople, three from Anatolia, and -our ^ 10 m e IYth Army Corps will arrive at Hodeidah shortly to deal with the revolt in Yemen under the Idrisee.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from the acting consul at Jeddah, reporting on the state of affairs in the Hedjaz and Yemen, with special reference to the disturbed state of the country about Medina, and the Arab rising in the Yemen under Seyyid Ali-el-Idrisee of Sabyeah, together with a paraphrase of a telegram which I have just received showing an improvement of the situation in the Loheia district.

I REGRET to inform your Excellency that owing to ill-health, I have been unable to report earlier on the state of affairs existing in the vilayets of the Hedjaz and Yemen. About the third week in July there were rumours afloat that trouble was brewing in Mecca. It was expected that certain notorious Arabs amongst the townspeople contemplated, with the assistance of some Bedouins, an attack on the prison in which were confined about a dozen of their comrades that had been arrested under the orders of Marshal Kazim Pasha, the late vali, in connection with the disturbances that took place in Mecca in November last year. (Please see Mr. Monahan’s despatches Nos. 60 and 64 of 1908.) Dissatisfaction amongst the members of the Committee of “Union and Progress at Mecca has prevailed ever since at the apparent weakness displayed by Kazim Pasha in dealing with the rioters on that occasion. Fuad Pasha, with the co-operation of the Grand Shereef, has since assuming charge of the vilayet, caused the ringleaders and others concerned in the riots of last No\ ember to be arrested and put under restraint. As soon as trouble was anticipated last month, the prisoners referred to above were removed to the principal fortress in Mecca, the guns of which were turned on t e own and its garrison strengthened. Great excitement prevailed. On the 22nd July the Grand Shereef, Hussain Pasha, arrived at Mecca trom iaii, and exhorted the townspeople to desist from demonstrations hostile to t e au on xes and to remain tranquil, as nothing would happen on the present occasion. His High ness was followed on the 26th by Fuad Pasha, the governor-general accompanied by the commandant of Taif, a colonel of the staff, two guns, an a sma detachment of troops. , t ^ i OTir | On the vali’s arrival in Mecca, some other disaffected Arabs were impn ^ ’ orders sent to Taif to arrest the notorious Mahomed Ali, who or many y p served as chief secretary to the ex-Grand Shereefs Aoun and i Z- j would appear that the disturbances in Mecca were fomented by e ^ j Mahomed Ali, in whose house was found a quantity of rifles, revo ver '’ ’ m ber ammunition, and that he had served out arms to the townspeople unng ^ Mahomed Ali was then brought under strong escort to Mecca, whenc^ in c ^p^ J of twenty others arrested since the first trouble in [November , The prompt and energetic action of the vali on the present n q U i e tly of nipping the projected disturbance in the bud, and the town settled down quietly thereafter. [2460 /— 1 ]Fuad Pasha, who on first arrival in the Iledjaz from Constantinople landed at Jeddah in “ ahram,” or pilgrim garb, and did not exchange^ visits with the consular corps, now availed himself of the opportunity of visiting this town and meeting the foreign consuls and principal merchants. He w r as, at the same time, anxious to arrange personally about the disposal of the twenty-one prisoneis from Mecca. ^ His Excellency arrived here on the morning of the 9th instant, and received the visits of the consular body on the same afternoon, which he returned personally on the two following days. The twenty-one prisoners were put on board the gun-boat Tashkubri ” during the early hours of the 10th morning, and were detained in that vessel till the arrival of the transport “ Hodeidah, ’ when they were transhipped and sent to Salonica for trial by court-martial. The Yali remained in Jeddah till the 14th August, when he left for Mecca en route for Taif, his summer residence. During his Excellency’s short stay here he convened a meeting of the principal merchants and discussed with them the exchange question in the Hedjaz. It would appear that Fuad Pasha has drafted a scheme for the elimination of foreign coins from the Hedjaz and the circulation of Turkish currency only. This he proposes to do by abolishing the “ umla” dollar, a fictitious coin used in this province as the basis of calculation in all commercial transactions. The rates for foreign moneys are to be fixed by the local administration in tariff piastres (z.e., Ottoman gold piastres), which will reduce their value from 15 to 25 per cent, according to the present local quotations. For example, the Turkish lira is now fixed at 103 piastres gold, whereas the Indian rupee will be 7 piastres instead of 8 as at present, and the Maria Theresa dollar at 6 piastres only against 10, the usual local rate. The scheme, in short, is, in my humble opinion, quite impracticable, and does not find favour with local merchants and foreign firms alike. Although the new tariff of exchange has been nominally put into force since the beginning of the Arabic month of Shaban (i.e., since the 17th August), and proclama tions issued penalising those who disregard it, it has only been adopted by a small section of the local mercantile community, including the sarrafs or money-changers, who will gain considerably in exchange thereby. It is not at all expected that the new regulations will be observed for very long, for a few months at the outside, when the present tariff will most probably share the fate of its predecessors, unless the vilayet presses the reform, and puts into circulation in this province a sufficiency of Turkish piastres and mejidies to serve commercial requirements. , foreign pilgrims will lose considerably when exchanging their money, or when utilising same in purchasing supplies. fhe water question, which is a very important one in Jeddah, was also raised duiing the valis visit to this town, and the old scheme to bring water into the town from a place called Ain I arraj ” was revived, although I hardly think that anything will result from all this talk, or that steps will be taken to improve the water supply, if it can be appropriately said that Jeddah possesses a water supply at ail. I he condenser for distilling sea w T ater, set up in the town about two years ago, works by nts and starts, and if the water supply is not cut off owing to a break-down in the machinery, it generally remains interrupted while the water commission and t leu contractor, or the latter and his engineer, are at variance over some trifling matter. The departure of Fuad Pasha for Jeddah coincided with that of the Grand bhereef, who set out from Mecca in the direction of Taif. His Highness was accompame y ns son, Shereef Ali, several members of the shereefian clan, and a following of Bedouins. Hussain Pasha, the Grand Shereef, then encamped at a p ace ca e m a , some distance outside Taif. The object of these warlike prepara- 10 ns on ® P ar 0 _ 118 ig iae8 s is not known. It has been said that he intends to bring about the subjugation of the tribesmen in the country adjacent to Taif, while o ier rumours credit him with an intention to collect a force of 10,000 men and march molesting* raxavanffan!f pilgrims^ ' V16W t0 PMishillg ^ ^ thefe ^ haV6 ^ of affairs [ntt'qulrte^ rea ° hed a feW dayS ag ° fr0m Medina re g ardin g thestate Rediel) 1 117tl?'fiiK- 1 ^ V le , au&lt; '' l&lt; ’ 1 ' tles at Medina have been turned during the month of Redjeb (17th July-16th August) to the depredations, in the neighbourhood, of Arabs3 belonging to the powerful tribes of El-Hamida, that inhabit the mountainous country to the south of that place. The latter can muster between 6,000 and 7,000 riflemen, that gave the Turks a deal of trouble in 1901. These tribesmen have been fairly quiet since a n d the present unrest has been brought about by the irregular payment by the local ^horities of their annual hush-money. They have moreover been instigated to rise by uie clan of Beni Ali, who it might be remembered caused the Hedjaz Government serious anxiety during the past pilgrirn season, owing to their attacks on pilgrim caravans moving between Mecca and Medina. The Arabs of the El-Hamida tribe began last month by molesting pilgrims to the shrine of Syyed-el-Hamza that is just outside Medina. On the 23rd July, twelve persons belonging to the above-mentioned tribe were captured by Turkish troops at a place called Hafeera and brought in chains into Medina. On the following day another man was captured. The sheikhs then sent a message to the authorities that they would come in and tender their submission if their clansmen were liberated. Their request was peremptorily refused, and the officials responded with the dispatch of a body of soldiers and two cannon to protect the pilgrim route to El-Hamza. On the 27th July, that was the principal day of visit to the sacred shrine (El- Ziyarat), some tribesmen attacked the Turkish look-out station in the vicinity and wounded three soldiers. The same afternoon the Hedjaz railway line in that quarter was attacked, when two soldiers were killed. Some 36 metres of the railway line were destroyed by the raiders, that also dismantled the telegraph posts. A force was immediately dispatched to the scene from Medina, and the railway line repaired and the telegraph-posts reinstalled. Daily raids were made by the tribesmen thereafter, but proved ineffective owing to the townspeople arming themselves and assisting the troops to repel the attacks. Finding their raids proved unsuccessful, the Arabs made overtures for peace on the 3rd instant, to which the Governor of Medina replied that a peaceful settlement could only be arrived at by the payment on the part of the tribe of blood-money for the Turkish soldiers killed, and the restitution of the loot taken by the Bedouins from caravans during the month of Bejab. A few days later the railway station at Medina was fired on. The garrison were turned out under the commandant, who, with four guns, went after the raiders. The latter offered a stubborn resistance, but were eventually put to flight, after suffering some loss. Three Arabs were taken prisoners, and five Mauser rifles and five camels captured. The casualties on the Turkish side consisted of three men killed and four wounded. Keinforcements to the extent of twelve battalions have now been requisitioned by the authorities from Damascus to enable them to take strong measures against the rebellious and predatory tribe of El-Hamida, who, it is rumoured, have invoked the assistance of other neighbouring clans. My informant reports that on the 6 th instant 500 cases of rifles had been received at Medina, and it was expected that the reinforcements mentioned above would arrive within a week or two. Not many days ago the postal convoy was attacked on the road between this and Medina and the whole of the mails robbed. The Post Office now forwaids mails to Medina via Suez and Damascus. _ ir u On the 25th instant a report was received from Hodeidah to the effect that t e Arabs in the Tehama had risen at the instigation of the Mahdi of Sabyeah, byye Ali-el-Idrisee (referred to in my despatch from Hodeidah No. 12/E of the 14th April, 1909), and that great anxiety was being displayed by the local authorities at t le xapic progress the revolt appeared to be making. . . ,, n The scene of the disturbance was at first confined to the Zaidyia dis ric &gt; ^ Hodeidah, where Arabs of the Suleil and Beni Kais clans between the 15th ana 17th August attacked a convoy en route to Hujjur, killed ten men an an o cer n took eleven camels laden with provisions. They then attacked an cap uie military store dep6t at Suk-el-Husseib, that serves the important garrisons stationec the Hujjeh and El-Hujiur districts. . . , ii-j ■Rp; crfl In the meantime, another body of the rebels had investee a p ace © » north of Zaidyia and the stronghold of Boni Pasha, the principal sheikh district. &amp; .

According to information received from the vice-consulate, it would appear that Hodeidah is the objective of the insurgents movement where there are not more than 400 soldiers and six guns. j i ^ c x r. The authorities are naturally very much concerned about the safety of the town, and are making preparations to repel any attack from che noith,and ha\e armed several hundreds of the inhabitants. It is, however, feared that the Zereneek tribesmen in the ^ south that are still suffering from the sting of the chastisement meted out to them during the punitive expedition in February and March last, might take advantage of the present state of affairs and enter and sack Hodeidah. The vali has telegraphed to Constantinople for reinforcements. In the meantime, four battalions of infantry from Sanaa under Lieutenant-Colonel Jamal Bey have been moved towards Zaidyia to deal with the rebels in that quarter. With, &amp;c. G. A. RICHARDSON.

SINCE posting my despatch No. 9 of the 19th ultimo to your Excellency, there has not been much to report with reference to the punitive operations proceeding against the Zereneek tribe. Major Riza Bey, who had occupied a strong position at Husseinia for some six weeks previously, proceeded on the 27th ultimo to a place called Malahah in the vicinity, his object being to join hands with Yussuf Pasha’s force in the south at Beit-el-Fakih. He engaged the tribesmen en route, who offered a very stubborn resistance and harassed his advance, and who were put to flight eventually, but only after they had suffered severely. It is reported that Riza Bey also suffered greatly m this engagement. . The Turkish gun-boat “ Tash-Kubri ” disembarked here on the 31st ultimo about fifty of Riza Bey’s wounded in the last action referred to, that were taken on boaid of her at Faza. . . Q , At the close of last month, the two principal Syyeds m the Tehama, viz., byyed Abdul Barri, of Mara war, and Syyed Ahmed Bahr, of Monsoona, complame o ic vilayet about the useless and wicked bloodshed going on in the Zerenee tern orj, where, they pointed out, the Sheikhs and tribesmen were prepared to surren ei an assert their allegiance to the Ottoman Government. ^ -c Instructions were then sent to Syyed Ahmed Pasha Es-Sherai, ic ' a ^ or 0 } town, who possesses great influence with the Zereneek tribesmen am o ier i ra s m the neighbourhood of Hodeidah, to proceed to Beit-el-Fakih and lend his good offices in the matter of arranging a settlement with the rebel tribesmen noy a Y in § ' their submission.

The main force then continued its march to Monsooiia, as e . auc j base at Beit-el-Fakih was now exhausted, and communication cut between Hodeidah, owing to the hostile attitude of the intervening country. [2267 k—2]o Supplies, however, have since been pushed from here to Monsooria during the first week or ten days of the current month, enabling Yussuf Pasha to return to his head quarters with 150 camels of provisions. On the 11th instant the Headmen of the El-Kabassi clan, an important subsection of the Zereneek tribe, entered Beit-el-Fakih and sued for peace. It would now appear from reports received by the authorities here that nearly all the Zereneek Sheikhs, with few exceptions, have since arrived at Yussuf Pasha’s camp to tender their submission. Syyed Ahmed Pasha Es-Sherai is also reported to have arrived at Beit-el-Fakih, where the question of the surrender of the tribesmen is under consideration. ^ It is expected that the punitive operations will shortly cease. Supplies are being now dispatched to Beit-el-Fakih and Zebeed, with which places communication has once more been restored. A trade caravan of seventy camels bringing dyed stuffs from Zebeed reached this safely yesterday, the first to arrive for several months. The Mutessarif of Hodeidah, who has been absent at Beit-el-Fakih during the past two months, is expected to return in a fortnight, his presence there any longer being considered undesirable by the military element.

IN continuation of my despatch to your Excellency, No. 6 of the 2nd instant, I have now the honour to report that General (Mir-Liwa) Yussuf Pasha arrived here on the 15th instant from Sana’a to command the punitive operations against the Zerenee tribe three battalions of infantry from the capital, viz., the third battalions of the 52nd, 62nd, and 37th Regiments respectively, with a collective strength of about 1,500 men, 25 troopers (cavalry), 100 mounted gendarmes, and 4 guns accompanied the above-mentioned officer, and proceeded directly to Marawar, where the reintorcements were concentrated. .. Pj1 .. t, • , A few days later, two companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 64th Regiment, comprising 143 foot soldiers, arrived from Hujjur, to join the expeditionary torce. On the 7th instant Yussuf Pasha who had come to Hodeidah to make arrangements about transport and supplies for the force about to operate under him, left for Marawar with the two companies of infantry that had arrived from Hujjui. , News reached Hodiedah on the same day that Major Mahomed Riza Bey had been attacked by the tribesmen in force at Husseinia, where he was securely entrenched in the enemy’s stronghold that he had previously captured. e succee ec m * &amp; the rebels, inflicting severe losses on them. It is reported that about eighty Arabs killed and many more wounded. , Q ,, • . , The strength of Yussuf Pasha’s force that started from Marawar on tl.e Stl msfa .t may be said to consist of 1,500 infantry, 125 cavalry, regular and irregular, and four mountain guns. n f t j-. p a bsi tribe with some followers met him At the above place, five Sheikhs ot the adsi ruoe . . , ,, o of and accompanied the troops to Shujaina, where th e 7 J 0 . 1 ^ , / .. eas t e rn El Rumah, who escorted them as far as Mahwat, that is situated on the eastern “*■ ox;» “ r; t * ^ ^ “s the north-eastern Zereneek districts asking for terms. e . . . ,, . , -| len vilayet that sent strict injunctions to the General that the submission^ the tribesmen could only be accepted on their carrying out the fo owing con i 1.

The surrender of fifty-seven sureties, representing various sections of the tribe and comprising merchants at Monsouria and Dureimi, to be retained as a guarantee for the future good behaviour of the tribe. The Zereneek Sheikhs and Arabs were ready to accept the first tw T o conditions, but could not entertain the three latter Turkish proposals. On the 10th instant Yussuf Pasha, who was still at Mahwat, attacked several villages in the vicinity, and after punishing the Arabs returned to his camp at the above place On the 13th his force, after several hours’ severe fighting, reached Beit-el-Fakih, and took up a strong position outside the town. Here he (Yussuf Pasha) was joined bv the troops under the Mutessarif of Hodeidah, that had been there for nearly a month being obliged to fortify themselves since the reverse of the 23rd February last, and to wait reinforcements. The expeditionary force was thus strengthened by some 700 more infantry and two maxims. News reached the acting Mutessarif here from Beit-el-Fakih this afternoon to the effect that Yussuf Pasha had on the previous morning marched out against the tribesmen that were encamped in great strength at the villages of Hattabieh, Kokar, and Abassi, in the vicinity, and after eight hours’ fighting compelled them to abandon their position and flee. It was estimated that the losses on the Arab side exceeded 100 men killed and a similar number wounded. A big quantity of sheep and cattle were captured by the troops and taken to Beit-el-Fakih. The Turkish losses are not known, but they were not great from all accounts. On the same day Major Riza Bey, commanding the southern operating force, attacked the rebels in the vicinity of Husseinia, and punished them severely. I am informed that Yussuf Pasha has now reported to head-quarters that it has been ascertained that the neighbouring clans are making common cause with the Zereneek tribesmen against the Turks, and that the strength of his force is inadequate to bring about their utter subjugation. In addition to the troops under Yussuf Pasha at Beit-el-Fakih, there are four and a-half battalions of infantry (1,500 to 1,600 men in all) and two guns (mountain battery), under Riza Bey at Husseinia, that is just north of Zebeed, and situated about midway between the latter place and Beit-el-Fakih. It has not been possible to ascertain the numbers of and the regiments to which the above battalions belong. These were moved to Zebeed from Reima and the Tai’z district. I believe that one of them is the 14th Nishanjee Battalion, attached to the Yemen Army Corps. The Turkish gun-boats “Tash-Kubri” and “Nau-Shahr” have shown great activity lately in patrolling the Zereneek littoral, with a view to preventing the entry of arms into the country, destined for the use of the rebel tribe.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 846 of the 8th December last, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeidah, reporting on the reforms which it was recently proposed to introduce in the Yemen. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Richardson to Sir G. Lowther. (No. f)/E.) Sir, Hodeidah, March 1, 1909. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Holders despatch of the 9th December last, transmitting copy of one addressed by yotir Excellency to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which was inclosed an extract from the “ Shura-i-ummat,” giving a summary of the proposed scheme of reforms for the Yemen Vilayet. I beg to offer a few observations on the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers with reference to the proposed arrangement with the Imam Syyed Yahya. It will be seen from the above that it is intended to delegate the civil and religious administration in the district of Sada to Yahya. I infer from this statement that the central authorities are unaware of the fact that the Imam Syyed Yahya has not, since the death of his father, the Imam Hamiduddin in 1904, had any vestige of authority at Sada or its en\ irons. His sphere of influence during the past four or five years has been limited to Kuflet-Azhar and Shahara and the neighbouring country. About three months prior to his death the late Imam Hamiduddin was affected with a stroke of paralysis in one of his upper extremities. According to the precepts of the Zeidi faith, it is strictly enjoined, infer alia, that the person selected to fill the post of Imam should be sound in every limb. ... When attacked by paralysis, a Notable of Sada, one Syyed Hassan-el-Kasimi-el- Dhaiyani, claimed the Imamate, but had not a sufficiently stiong following a le ime to back up his pretension. ,™ • • u However, since the death of the Imam Hamiduddm in 1904 , the Dhaiyam has openly asserted his claim, and has been able to hold his own in the Sac a t is net agams ^^It^true that he has been supported by the Turks at the instance of the late Commander-in-chief, Ahmed Fezi Pasha, with a view to crushing e povei o } \ 'During the greater part of last year the Dhaiyani was in conflict with the latter on whom he succeeded in inflicting a defeat on more than one occasion, and also ^ m^iS^o“e how the Turks will be able to delegate th^^^ of the district of Sada to Syyed Yahya now, unless, m conjunction with the latter, tliey ^ria^hTsatlti^btfufwhether the Sheikhs and other Notables at Shahara or Kuflet or in the Hashid territory will accord their , as ^ n * ment between the Imam and the Ottoman Governmen a ,. ° includintr Sana’a exclusive autonomy of the mountainous district north of Menekha, and including banaa and Taiz, under the Imam of the Zeidis. . • s I hardly think that the Central Governmen wi go so a . j ea( j hi s anything short of the above, if accepted by Syyed Ya y , &gt; dismissal by his followers, and the immediate appointment of a new in . . [2-&gt;0o /J'—5]2 The question of arrangement with the Imam is a most difficult matter, as there are numerous other factors to be considered in any final settlement. _ For ffistance, should the Turks decide to modify, however slightly, their present status m the Yemen highlands five or six Imams would immediately present themselves to lay claim to various districts of which their tribes were in possession and in occupation, and absolutely independent of the then Imam at Sanaa, up to the advent of the Turkish army in Yemen under General Moukhtar Pasha in 1873. It would be wrong to suppose that the districts of Hanaz, Hashid, Belad-el-bustan, Anis, Ta’iz, &amp;c., ever belonged to the forbears of the present Imam, although the J respective Chiefs and tribesmen of the above places have, on several occasions during n the Turkish occupation, made common cause with the Imam Syjed \ahya and his predecessor, Hamiduddin, in their attempts to drive out their Ottoman conquerors. In November last year two notable Yemen Sheikhs, Syyed Mahomed Muzaikar and Shereef Abdulla-bin-Hassan-el-Mutawakkal, that had been undergoing exile in the Island of Rhodes for several years landed at Hodeidah, having been dispatched to this province from Constantinople by the Ottoman Government. The object of their visit was to interview the Imam Syyed Yahya, and to induce him to send deputies to Constantinople, to present his claims before the Central Government, with a view to arranging a permanent peace in this vilayet. The above-mentioned Arab Chiefs, after spending about tvvo months in the interior, returned here on the 18th January last in company with Syyed Abdulla Ibrahim, the Kadi Izzi-es-Sherki and Syyed Mahomed-es-Shami, and sailed for Con- stantinople a few days later in a Khedivial steamer. These three latter personages, who have great influence with the Imam and their fellow tribesmen, were selected by Syyed Yahya to represent him in the negotiations pending with the Turkish Government. It is not generally credited that any satisfactory understanding will ever be reached, especially as the Imam and his entourage find the present an excellent oppor tunity for pressing their preposterous demands, which, if accepted, would be most prejudicial to Ottoman suzerainty. The Turkish forces in this province just now are not very strong, but a particular source of weakness has resulted since the departure of its best officers, who were well acquainted with the country and well tried in warfare against its mountaineers, so say nothing of the irreparable loss suffered by the Vllth Army Corps by the resignation of its veteran Field-Marshal, Ahmed Fezi Pasha, who had spent the best part of his life in the Yemen, and has been during the past quarter of a century more or less its successful leader in a continual strife with the truculent and rebellious inhabitants, by whom he was both feared and liked. Perhaps my views of the political situation may appear somewhat pessimistic, but it is hoped that future developments may prove my views to be wrong, and that the negotiations proceeding between the Turkish Government and the Imam Syyed Yahya will assume a favourable turn, and thus open a new era of peace and prosperity in this distressful and hapless province, where there are great possibilities.

After losing about thirty men and part of its transport*, it was obliged to beat a hasty retreat on Beit-el- Fakih. Two days later a Turkish convoy from Hodeidah, bound for Beit-el-Fakih, was held up by a strong force of Arabs, who killed about thirty men of the escort, and captured some twenty camels laden with stores and provisions destined for the operating force. Since the above incidents the troops under the Mutessarif have remained inactive at Beit-ebFakih awaiting reinforcements. s It has now been decided to augment considerably the strength of the punitive force that will consist of ten or twelve battalions of infantry, two companies of mounted gendarmes, and eight guns. Information from Sana’a reached Hodeidah this morning to the effect that General Yussuf Pasha had been appointed to conduct the operations in the Zereneek country, and that that officer, with three battalions of infantry, had already started from the capital. It is estimated that the Zereneek tril)e has a mobile force of about 10,000 men, who are well armed and are good marksmen, so that the Turks have not an easy task before them in hunting down and subduing these truculent tribesmen, that are distributed over a wide and scattered area. On the 21st February two Turkish gun-boats the “ Tashkubri ” and the “Nau- Shahir,” that have been sent from Constantinople to patrol the Yemen littoral of the Red Sea arrived here from Camaran, that they had reached a fortnight previously. On their voyage down the Red Sea they encountered two dhows near a place called Koz that were running arms. They succeeded in sinking one dhow and in capturing the other, and confiscating 350 rifles and a quantity of ammunition. These gun-boats are now cruising about the coast south of Hodeidah, and co-operating with the Turkish troops engaged on land against the Zereneek Arabs. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. A.

(Signed) E. GREY. [2048 s-1]2 had a plot afloat to imprison the old Field-Marshal, and give the chief command to one ot the other generals. Ahmed Fezi Pasha defeated their designs by taking timely precautions and removing the most troublesome and undesirable characters by sending them away to Constantinople, and promising others leave in due time. About 60 or 70 officers have thus left the Army Corps from Sana’a alone. The steps taken appear to have collapsed the military movement that threatened that might otherwise have developed serious results. On the whole, order and discipline amongst the large Sana’a garrison compares most favourably with that existing in many other important military centres in the Empire at this critical epoch in Ottoman history, and reflects great credit on t^e Commander-in- chief. My stay at Sana’a was rendered most agreeable by the courtesy shown me by the Acting Vali. On my arrival at Hodeidah I find matters in a confused state, only brought about in the course of the past week. A state of semi-anarchy, as it were, may be said to exist. The military seem masters of the situation. On the 19th instant a number of officers of the local garrison intercepted the carriage of the Mutessarif of Hodeidah while he was driving to his office, made him dismount by force, and without question or explanation compelled him to enter a boat that they had kept ready, and embark immediately on the Pubatino steamer “ Pelora ” that was lying in port, and that sailed the same afternoon for Suez. The late Mutessarif, Ahmed Izzat Bey, who had only been at Hodeidah for about three months, though incompetent was an inoffensive old official, and I believe very honest in his dealings, and did not merit in the least the arbitrary and insulting treat ment he was subjected to. The officers placed the local Commandant, General Arif Hikmet Pasha, in charge ot the mutessariflik, who might be said to be even more incompetent and useless than his predecessor. The General is merely a puppet, and virtually under orders of the officers referred to. These latter, numbering some thirty or forty at Hodeidah, for the most part uneducated, in conjunction with a few petty civil officials and some Arabs of no importance, have formed themselves into a body which they call “The Hodeidah Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress.” 1 hey appear to be interfering in the internal administrative affairs of this sanjak, and embarrassing such civil officials as still remain in the execution of their duties. fewdays ago they dismissed the Kaimakam of Djebel Reima, who was an Arab Sheikh, and leplaced him by a military officer, in spite of orders to the contrary from the vilayet. The situation is becoming more complicated every day, and this morning a report 10 m Sanaa says that Fezi Pasha, the Governor-General, has resigned and another that he has been dismissed. The Cadi and Muhasabjee (Controller of Accounts) of the Hodeidan district both resigned their appointments, and left for Constantinople without permission, a few days before the Mutessarif was driven away, anticipating rough treat ment at the hands of the local military officers. , The mutessariflik is without a Mudir Tahrirat (Chief of the Correspondence) and the Court of First Instance without a President. In short, there are no responsible administrative officials left in this town at present. Ncus has just arrived from Hujjeh that the troops there, at the instigation of their o cers, arres e an imprisoned the Commandant of that important military outposr, General Hakki Pasha, a few days ago. • JT 6 a 1 utl ! 0 !' it 7. ° f t he Vali and Commander-in-chief may be said to be set at naught m the Hodeidah district. • U e di ;® CU JT t0 sa ^ how ion S this state of affairs will last, but matters will grow serious for the Ottoman Government should the same continue for any length of time, especially should Ahmed Fezi Pasha relinquish his command at this critical juncture. i he Imam, who has been long inactive and rendered impotent through the tact and courage of hezi Pasha, might profit by the confused situation in the Yemen and strike another b ow.

The Goveninient would do well in asking him to remain for another year at Sana’a, although it is doubtful v\hethei his Excellency would consent to do so.I take this opportunity of correcting the information previously furnished, to the effect that Fczi Pasha was in his dotage and physically and mentally unfit to command the Yemen Army Corps. Though 75 years of age he is hale and hearty, and the peaceful state of Yemen during the past twelve months is entirely attributable to his tactful ability and judicious treatment of Arab Sheikhs, who formerly rebelled but now announce their allegiance to the Sultan. My recent visit to Sana’a after an absence of two years has helped to correct many ■wrono- impressions, and has afforded ample opportunities for studying the situation in this ever-changing province. The veteran Pield-Marshal might with advantage be relieved of the duties of Acting Yali which are a great strain on him, and in the performance of which he is without proper advice or assistance. The name of Mahmood Nedim Bey, a former Adjoint of the Yemen Governor- General, who has had considerable experience of Yemen affairs, in which he is better versed than any other official in Turkey, and who still enjoys great popularity in this vilavet amongst the inhabitants everywhere as well as commands the respect of the Imam, might be suggested in a friendly spirit to the Ministry of the Interior for nomination as Yali of this province. . , „ . _ There is also to be found locally a capable, honest, and experienced official, Iviamil Bey, at present Kaimakam of Zebeed, who would make an ideal Mutessarif of The situation in the Yemen can, in my hnmble opinion, be saved by the retention of Fezi Pasha in military command at Sana’a, with the appointment of Mahmood Nedim Bey as Yali and Kiamil Bey as Mutessarif of Hodeidah. The position of the Turks would be thereby greatly strengthened and all possible difficulties tided over locally at a time when the Imperial Government is engrossed with external affairs. There are at present about 23,000 troops stationed in this vi ayet, including those garrisoning the'Assyr Sanjak, which force is considered sufficiently strong to meet all emergencies.

[43483] [December 14.] Section 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received December 14.) (No. 846.) Sir, Percr, December 8, 1908. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith translation of an article from the “ Shura-i-ummet,” giving a summary of the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers with regard to reforms which it is proposed to carry out in the Yemen Vilayet. These proposals have been elaborated, partly at the instance of, and partly in collaboration with, Eerik Dassan Tahsin Pasha, the new Vali of the Yemen. The Vali is an upright and energetic Turk from South Albania. The most doubtful point in this scheme of reforms, which is an honest endeavour to introduce order and justice into the distressful province of the Yemen, is whether the Imam Yahya will agree to his independent sphere being restricted to the district of Sada, and whether he will give up the claim of his predecessors to Sana‘a, &amp;c. In reply to an inquiry as to how he would be able to overcome this difficulty, Hassan Tahsin Pasha said that when he got to Sana‘a he hoped by a firm and conciliatory policy to induce the Imam not to insist on his full claims, which are incompatible with Ottoman suzerainty, especially as the new system to be introduced goes a certain way towards establishing a semi-autonomous regime for Yemen. I understand that the Ottoman Society of Arab Union is in communication with the Imam through the Sultan of Lahej in the Aden Hinterland, and, among others, with a view to prevailing upon him not to take up an irreconcilable attitude towards the Turkish Government, which has now adopted the principles of equality and justice. I have, &amp;c (Signed) GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure in No. 1. Extract from the “ Shura-i-ummet” of December 3, 1908. (Translation.) THE deliberations in the Council of Ministers concerning reforms in the Yemen Vilayet have come to an end. The following is the summary we have obtained ol the decisions taken:— That instructions be given here in Constantinople to Tahsin Pasha, Vali of the Yemen, to the following effect, namely : To inquire into the present number of the military forces and to determine the true number required; to replace such officials as have acquired a reputation for bad conduct by suitable persons ; that the police be reorganized, and that lawsuits in places in the Yemen other than on the coast be dealt with by the Sheri Courts; to devote attention to the malpractices which have hitherto been in use in the collection of the local taxes and to the complaints arising therefrom, and, by putting into execution the terms of the regulation as to the collection of taxes and by other suitable means, to restore the work of collection to a legitimate and regular course, and to leave no room for the malpractices and complaints which have arisen ; and to take measures for the reform and increase of the existing local schools, and to devote efforts to the dissipation of the darkness of ignorance and to the advance of learning which is the basis of civilization, and towards sending to the military and civil schools in Constantinople the more competent among those who desire it of the sons of the local Notables, and towards sending to the Teachers’ Training College pupils to be employed later as teachers in the local schools. That, as it will not be possible always to remit money from here, means be found to defray tbe local expenses from the revenues of the vilayet, and that, on the [2048 o—l]present occasion, £T. &lt;50,000 be remitted from the Treasury in order that two months’ pay and allowances be paid to the civil functionaries and military officers and men. That, owing to the high prices and the distance, local salaries be proportionally ' That, in order to police the coasts of the vilayet and prevent smuggling a few ships, to be selected by the Ministry of Marine, be sent thither. That, owing to its distance from Sana’a, the Sanjak of Asi be detached irom the Yemen Vilayet and created into an independent Mutessanfate. tti-.ii That, as the facilitation of transport by establishing a railway J 101 ^ odeidak to Sana‘a is of the utmost importance, the plans formerly drawn up tor the purpose he examined, and measures be taken to put them into execution. That the civil and religious administration in the district ot Sana a, v here lie resides, be delegated to the Sherif Yahya, who claims the Imamate^and that an end be thus nut to bloodshed among Moslems, and that in regard to this matter, as news has been received of the arrival of the Yemen Notables, Sherif Abdullah-bm-Hassan and Ins companions, who were recently sent by the Government, the decision to be taken by the Government on the conclusion of their efforts be awaited. That the increases to be made in the salaries both civil and military be notified after examination, and that, as the retention of officials for a long peiiod in the said districts is productive of despair and lassitude, a period of three years be fixed foi militarv officers and two for civil officials, and that the t*i\il officials liaxe at the end of two years from the date of entering on their duties the option of being tianstericd or applying for three months’ leave, and their wish be at once complied with and return travelling expenses be allowed them. These decisions, having been come to by the Council of Ministers, have been signified in detail by despatches from the Grand Vizierate to the Ministry of the Interior and thence to the Vali of the said province, to the Sheykh-ul-Islamate, to the Ministries of War and Marine, and to the land Registry Department.Consul-General Cameron to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 12, 6*10 p.M.) .(No. 8.)

It is expected that the above vessel will be utilized in conveying reinforcements to the Yemen from the above port, where they will arrive from Syria and other places by the Hedjaz Railway vi5 Ma’an. According to the local authorities, it would appear that each of the other Army Corps in Turkey will contribute one regiment of infantry for temporary service in this province. It is to be inferred from this rumoured mobilization for the Yemen that the Turks either intend to make another attempt to crush the Imam, Syyed Yahya, as all peaceful missions to him have hitherto utterly failed, or that they anticipate an early general rising of the Arab population in the mountainous country that owe him allegiance. The deputation of Arab Sheikhs and Ulemas from the Hedjaz that recently journeyed to Sana’a to exhort the Arab tribesmen to remain loyal to the Caliph returned here last Tuesday from the capital. They visited Marawar, Kutte, and one or two small villages on the journey to Sana’a, and afterwards took the usual caravan route, returning the same way. They did not interview the tribesmen en route. t Their stay at Sana’a extended just over a fortnight. On their arrival the \ ah caused an assembly of the principal Sheikhs and townspeople and the high oracials to meet the Sheikhs at the Secretariat, where three of the deputation, viz., Sheikh Sa eh Kamaland Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Saddiq’, past and present Muftis respectively at Mecca o the Hanifi sect, and Sheikh El-Ulema, Sheikh Mahomed Babuseil, the Mufti of the Shafia sect, delivered addresses. They admonished the tribesmen for their past rebe ious conduct, and enjoined them to remain faithful to their Sultan and Caliph. iev deprecated the attitude assumed by the Imam, and described such as being contran to the dictates of the prophet. . , The assembly with one accord exclaimed, in reply, that they were lojal o t e [2753 5-9] (R ASIATIC TURKEY.

It will be difficult to send the intended reinforcements, but still more so to provide I advised the Sultan to accord a reasonable measure of local administrative power to the Imam and Sheikhs, and it was obvious that merely to concede to them the right of disposing of certain subordinate posts would be of no use in restoring tranquillity.

Prayers were afterwards offered outside of the Government offices for the Jon' life of His Majesty the Sultan, and the gathering dispersed. 0 The mission next addressed a letter to the Imam Syyed Yahya at Khamir warning him against his rebellious and defiant behaviour towards the Ottoman Government during the past two or three years. They further informed him that if he tendered Ins submission, the Sultan was prepared to grant him rank and an allowance monthly, and to accord him a status similar to that of the Grand sll erect of Mecca. The Hediaz deputation of Sheikhs and Ulemas further requested him (the Imam) to release all Arab hostages and Turkish prisoners held by him for some time past in Ins stronghold at Shahara. They also earnestly advised him to desist fiom his illegal attitude in demanding tithes and “verge” from the tribesmen in the mountainous districts, as they had already to pay such to the Ottoman Government. The Imam, in reply, stated that he was not a rebel but on the contrary, that he was loyal to the Sultan. The local Turkish officials, he added, owing to their abuse of authority and oppression of the poorer agricultural classes, were responsible for Ins action in waging war and for the bloodshed that had resulted therefrom. He (Syyed Yahya) demanded abrogation of the “ Tanzeem ” (Turkish civil law) and the substitution of the laws of Islam (“Cheriat”). A second letter was then sent to Syyed Yahya by the deputation again warning him that severe chastisement, awaited him unless he submitted in g 0 °d rebuking him for having subscribed himself as “Commander of the Faithful ’ m the communication received by them from him.

They were daily visited by spies and emissaries of the Imam at the capital, who kept him informed of their proceedings. They (the Sheikhs) could not but observe with regret that, although the townspeople crowded them with visits daily, when they were unfortunate enough to lose one of their most distinguished members, the Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Saddiq’, the Hanifia Mufti, wdio died from malarial fever, not a single Arab came to offer them condolences or to render assistance at his funeral. ... . . &lt; On the whole, the Sheikhs expressed dissatisfaction and disappointment at the results of their mission to the Yemenites, which they openly admitted had proved utterly futile.

About 800 drafts (mixed) ha\e airived in the meantime to replete their thinned battalions, and now, two years latter, on the eve ot their return they can only muster 2,400 men in the eight battalions ! These troops were generally utilized in all the 1 urkish engagements against the Imam, and saw the hr. nt of the fighting during that prolonged and arduous campaign. They suffered heavily in the expedition of the winter of 1905 against the stronghold of Shahara, where 'the total Turkish losses were estimated at between 8,000 and 10.000 men. The transport “ Smyrna ” from Constantinople and Smyrna anchored in the roadstead yesterday morning and landed 325 mules. She proceeded to Camaran this morning, and on her return, after completion of twenty-four horns quarantine, will discharge a quantity of fodder and stores for the Military Department, and disembark fifty men of the Transport Corps. * The Albanian battalions will most probably be transported in the above vessel in the course of next week. The local military authorities inform me that four battalions of regulars from the Adana district and about 12,000 drafts from Anatolia are expected shortly for service in this vilayet, where the strength of the Army Corps cannot exceed 20,000 or 25.000 men of all arms. Ferik Yussuf Pasha, perhaps the most able and successful General in the Yemen that has kept the Imam’s hordes at bay in the vicinity of Amran during the past eighteen months, has now been recalled to head-quarters and stationed at Eauda, which is about 3^ miles north of the capital. This step, taken under issue of an Imperial Irade, was the result of a complaint submitted to the Sultan by the Sheikh of Amran, Hizam-es-Sa‘ar, during the recent visit of the Yemen Sheikhs to Constantinople.

I HAVE the honour to report the movements of troops and transports in this district as follows:— y$f 1. The transport “ Assyr ” arrived here from Constantinople on the 2nd instant, calling at Camaran en route, where she discharged about 150 tons of coal. The vessel embarked 1,780 time-expired men the same evening, and sailed again the next morning for Beyrout. 2. The transport “ Termizghan ” arrived on the 8th instant from Constantinople, bringing 1,500 recruits for the Yemen Army Corps that she took on board at Smyrna. Three hundred of the above soldiers will be transported this evening by means of “ sambooks ” (sailing-boats) to Loheia, whence they will be moved in the direction of Hajjeh to strengthen the battalion stationed there. Five hundred more of these drafts are under orders to proceed to Sana’a in the course of the next few days. The “Termizghan” also brought the members of a Commission from Constantinople to investigate Yemen affairs, consisting of General Sabit Pasha, President, and Majors-General Mustapha and Yussuf Pashas and Hajee Ibrahim Najmuddin Effendi as members. It is expected that the Commission, that has received no definite instructions so far as to its duties, will be stationed permanently at Hodeida for the purpose of controlling the finances of this vilayet. The deputation of Arab Sheikhs and Ulemas, representing the Arab tribesmen that proceeded to Constantinople some two months ago, returned to Hodeida by the above-mentioned transport. These Sheikhs appear highly gratified with their visit to the capital and with the kindness shown them by the Sultan, who has decorated all of them, and bestowed rank and high honours on some of their party. _ &gt; Amongst the latter might be mentioned the name of Hizam-es-Sa ar, Sheikh of Amran, who has been created a Pasha, and who, it might be remembered, during the Turkish operations against the Imam in the winter of 1905, in^spite of having previously tendered his submission to Fezi Pasha, who appointed him Kaimakam of Amran, led a flying column of 400 men and 4 guns, with a convoy of 200 camels of ammunition, into a trap in the mountains north of Sana’a and caused their entire extermination, including their Commander, Major-General Riza Pasha, and the capture of the guns and ammuni tion by the rebels. Sherif Ahmed-bin-Hussain, a Sheikh of Sabyieh, in the Beni Marwan country, who had been arrested for debt shortly prior to his selection on the deputation to the Palace, has been similarly honoured by bestowal of the rank of Pasha. Some of the Sheikhs that belong to the Ta’iz Sanjak included in the deputation are representative of the tribesmen of their district, and one or two of the Sana a Sheikhs are fairly influential persons.

WITH reference to previous correspondence with your Excellency on the subject, I have now the honour to again bring to notice another series of disturbances caused m this town by time-expired soldiers; that* besides dislocating trade in general lor nearl} a fortnight, set up a feeling of uneasiness in the minds of both foreigneis and ot the local population alike, principally owing to the unconcern ot the authorities, and, at t e same time, of their utter inability to cope with the situation. . Since the beginning of the month, these soldiers had begun to arrive from a parts of the interior, as well as by sea from the neighbouring ports of Lobeia Ueezan, Ras Zebeed, and Mokha, having in many instances thrown down their arms and left their stations without permission, owing to having completed their regular term o service m the “ nizam.” , . j j • Their numbers had exceeded 1,500 by the 10th instant when they proc^ee e in a body to the house of the local Commandant, Arif Pasha, and demanded t icir es eie (discharge papers). They forcibly compelled the General to accompany them to the command offices and to start issuing the above. , . . , Later in the day a considerable number of these soldiers visited t e azaars am warned all traders that their shops would be sacked if kept open, thus compe ing a tradesmen to close their places of business for two or three days thereatter. As is usual on such occasions, the source of the water supply of t le town was seize , and the supply intercepted for some days. . , , , When ihe Khedivial mail steamer “ Missir ” was lying off in the roadstead on the 10th instant, a body of soldiers made a noisy demonstration at the an ing s age, am demanded to be sent home in that vessel. In the presence of the Governor and the General Officer Comman ing, e captain and the agent of the Khedivial Company were prevente y e mu ^ nou troops from embarking, when the ship was ready to proceed on^ her voyage o m , and were threatened to be detained unless they carried away the tnne-expire men. I warned the Vali by telegraph and the local Mutessarif that the overnmen be held responsible for any loss accruing to the British Shipping Company iron i J to its vessel caused by the action of these time-expired soldieis. e a ultimately induced with promises that they would very soon be shippe ome, o q pier, and allow the captain of the “Missir ” to embark. . , The following week witnessed a continuation of these disorderly scenes by t “ istibdal,” who now commenced to forcibly enter in numbers the houses ot Aiabs and offer insults to their women. [2607 cc—2]Affairs reached a crisis on the night of the 19th, when the mutineers, iully 1 500 strono- turned out at between 6 and 7 in the evening, and attacked the bazaars and ran loose°i’n the town. They captured several rifles from the sentries on duty at various posts, and planned a rush on the fort and ammunition anil powder magazines, which Their attempt was baffled by certain officers receiving information of tlicir intentions in time, and issuing orders to the guards concerned to open fire on the mutineers, which they did thus driving them off. The latter next proceeded to attack and enter private houses and carry off women, which enraged the townspeople beyond endurance who turned out a few thousands strong. An encounter ensued between tne Arabs and the soldiers, and ritles, daggers, and clubs were freely used, resulting in the latter being put to flight after having four men killed and fourteen wounded seriously, two more deaths occurred amongst the above wounded since. i- x a The action of the local population appears to have checked further disturbance on the pari of the soldiers, whose mutinous plans seemed to have collapsed ^eiy suddenly. The Arabs have hitherto been afraid to retaliate on account of the authorities, but in the above instance a hint had been thrown out to them by ceitain prominent officials that they would be justified in responding to the call to repel the attacks from the troops. reconciliation hag &amp;ince been effecte( i between the townspeople and the soldiers, and things have quieted down very suddenly. , T r i -j i j xi • It is now three weeks since these troops continued to pour into Hodeidah, and their numbers have swelled to over 2,000, but there are no transports available to take them away, although the military authorities have been expecting a ship daily for the past mon th. . . . Rumours are current here of the outbreak of a mutiny, incited by their officers amongst the troops up at Sana’a and other places at the front, and that an Albanian battalion has thrown down its arms and is about to come down to Hodeidah. The authority of the Commander-in-chief has been set at naught at the capital, and from accounts from a reliable source it would appear that there is no discipline amongst the troops, and that Fezi Pasha is afraid to interfere owing to having no troops at his disposal on whom he may rely to enforce his orders. I am informed that the transport “ Assyr,” that left Constantinople at the end of June with drafts for the Yemen, was obliged to return on account of a mutiny on board amongst the troops, and their refusal to come out to this vilayet.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 393 of the 27th ultimo, respecting the affairs of the Yemen, I have the honour to report that the Arab Sheikhs who had come to Constantinople in response to the Sultan’s invitation were received in audience by His Majesty before their departure, and addressed by His Majesty in a speech, of which the gist w r as that the conduct of the rebels was contrary to the will of God and the Prophet, and that bloodshed amongst Mussulmans must be«stopped. He had caused a scheme of reform to be drawn up which would insure prosperity and good government, and had approved the scheme and given orders for it to he put into execution. The delivery of an address of this kind by the Sultan, who was speaking mainly in his capacity as Caliph, is a most unusual event, as is also the publication of an account of such proceedings. I have the honour to annex an extract from the ' Levant Herald,” giving an account of what passed on this occasion.^ According to the Sublime Porte, a certain measure of administrative independence has been accorded to the Yemen. The subordinate provincial officials from the rank of Kaimakam and Mudir (that is, the heads of Cantons and their subdivisions, see G. Young, Volume I, pp. 57 and 58), will he Arabs appointed by the Imam and Sheikhs, while the Governor-General and Governors (Mutessarifs) will be nominated by the Central Government. I doubt these concessions satisfying the Imam, however satisfactory they may have been to the Sheikhs who came here, among whom there were, I believe, absolutely no representatives of the rebel party, hut I imagine that the scope and extent of the concessions is still under discussion, and that the question can on y he definitely settled after the deputation has returned to the Yemen and conferred with the Imam. It is quite evident, however, that the present state of aliairs cannot continue without the Sultan risking the loss of the Yemen, and ^ that Turkey canno support the drain of men and money which the insurrection m that province has entailed for several years past. It would probably be below the mark o es ima.e e annual loss of life at 10,000 men a-year and the expenditure at close on 500,000*., while at the same time the disturbances in the Yemen encourage discontent among the whole Arab population of the neighbouring regions. 11 I have, &amp;c.

Foreign Secret. Your telegrams 20th and 23rd July. Aden. Please report what steps have been taken to give effect to instructions in my telegrams of 14th and 18th June for withdrawal of Political Officer from Dthala. Success of Imam, if as great as is reported, may undoubtedly produce complications which will have to be settled as they arise, but it constitutes no reason, in opinion of His Majesty’s Government, why with drawal of Political Officer should be delayed. There seem on the contrary distinct advantages in view of situation at Constantinople in avoiding as long as possible dealings with Imam and in treating question as far as possible as one between him and Turkish Government. Any idea of retaining Political Officer at Dthala for purposes of negotiations with Imam cannot therefore be entertained. But I should be glad of your views as to advice which, in these circumstances, should be given to Amir of Dthala, if without any suggestion from us he applies for it as to his own dealings with Imam. Is it necessary at present to do more than warn him against allowing himself or his subjects to take part in trans-frontier affairs? The broad object of His Majesty’s Government, as you will have understood from my despatches, is to preserve towards Turkey our international obligations, and in other respects to avoid responsibility for tribal affairs in hinterland. I am most sincerely impressed with risk of allowing ourselves to give pledges in anticipation of complications with the Imam which may involve us hereafter in military operations, as disastrous as the recent ones in Somaliland, on the borders of the protectorate at an impossible distance from the fortress of Aden, which is the real British interest.Fi'om Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, Uth June 1907. Foreign Secret. Aden. Your Secret letter No. 74, dated 25th April last. Despatch goes by this mail. I approve proposals made in paragraphs 9-12 of your letter, on the understanding that Resident is satisfied that scheme of paying Kotaibi tribes through Amir of Dthala will not occasion fresh disputes, and that redistribution of posts is so arranged as to be acceptable to tribes concerned. It is presumed that payment of increased Haushabi stipend through Abdali Sultan and transfer to him of post at Nobat Dakim, will cause no difficulty. Proposal that these arrangements should be introduced before Political Officer finally leaves Dthala is approved on understanding that be does not prolong his stay there for more than one month after receipt by him of orders. This accords with Resident s letter of 27th January last in which, having before him question of increase of stipends and redistribution of posts, he approved date suggested by Political Officer for latter’s withdrawal, viz., 28th February. Jacob will of course act in spirit of policy declared by His Majesty’s Government in adjusting any difficulties that may arise. Except on occasions of undoubted emergency, no action of the kind suggested in paragraph 14 of your letter should be taken without previous reference to me.

Section 1, * [21790] No. 1. Sir N. O'Conor to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 2.) (No. 393.) ' * y Sir ’ „ 7TrrTJ „ . 1 Therapia, June 27, 1907. : vli 11 reference to my despatches No. 371 of the 20th instant and No. 392 of the 25th instant, I have the honour to inform you that the Report of the Special Com mission about affairs in the Yemen was discussed at the Council of Ministers held on the 16th instant. I learn that the Report dwells upon the extreme poverty of the population, and contrasts the action of the Imperial Government, which is mainly concerned with the collection of taxes, with that of neighbouring Governments, which help the people under their rule and give them money. (This is presumably an allusion to the allowances made by the Government of India to the Sheikhs in the Aden Hinterland.) The Commission proposes a certain measure of self-government, setting forth that, in order to flatter the native Sheikhs and to satisfy their ambition, it would be well to choose the Kai'makams and Mutessarifs from among their number instead of sending Turkish officials from Constantinople, the post of Vali being alone retained for a Turk. The Report proceeds to point out the difficulty of maintaining a force of 50,000 to 60,000 men in the Yemen and the inadequate results which have so far attended the military efforts of the Imperial Government to repress the insurrection which, if not somehow checked, may very shortly (thanks to outside encouragement) spread to the Hedjaz, although hitherto the influence of the Emir of Mecca has prevented this. The Report is said to state that there is no doubt but that the Arab movement is actively encouraged and sunnorted bv England, and amues that if some means of winnimr over lilc .u.c4tivo jjujjuicuiuii tut; uuii sqieeuiuy auupieu ± urney win lose wnai mnuence ana authority she retains in the Red Sea. The Council came to no definite decision on the subject, but I understand that the feeling of the Ministers who took part in it was generally in favour of concessions being made to the native demands. They are fully conscious of the uselessness of wasting more men and money in a futile attempt to subjugate these insurgent tribes, and, as administrative posts in the Yemen are seldom very remunerative, they are not much sought after by Turkish officials.

THE transport Smyrna, whose arrival with the members of the Imperial Yemen Commission was reported in my despatch No. 13 of the 27th April last, sailed again yesterday for Constantinople, taking hack the above Commission. She also conveyed Mahmoud Nedim Bey, ex-Adjoint of the Tali, and forty-four Arabs, selected by the Commission as representatives of the principal tribes in this province, and who are now proceeding to Constantinople. At the instance of the Commission an Imperial Irade was promulgated three or tour weeks ago, inviting the Yemen inhabitants to select and dispatch to Constan tinople their chief men and Sheikhs, with the view to place their grievances personally before the Sultan, and to point out the causes of the dissatisfaction prevalent, with suggestions for the amelioration of the condition of their unhappy country, in order that proper measures might be devised and found to remedy same permanently. Among the delegates from Sana’a may be mentioned the names of Syyed Abdul Ivadir, Ali-el-Jarrafi, El Kadi Syyed Mahomed-ibn-el-Monsoor, Syyed Hamood-bin- Ghalib, a son and grandson of former Imams, persons of influence, who might rightly be intrusted to voice authoritatively the opinions of the tribes they represent. The Kazas of Amran, Damar, Jible, Taiz, Harraz, Aboo Airish, Zebeed, and Hodeidah have sent delegates, the latter only one, owing to the disinclination of the local merchants to go to Constantinople and set forth their views, chiefly through dread of Syyed Ahmed-es-Sherai Pasha, the Mayor of this town, who has managed lo get one of his tools included in the deputation to the Palace. I learn from a reliable source that the Commission, on arrival at Sana’a, dispatched a messenger to the Imam inviting him also to send delegates to accompany those from other parts of the Yemen to Constantinople, but no reply, as far as can be ascertained, was elicited from Syyed Yahya. It is for this reason probably that the Commission did not waste time at Sana’a endeavouring to arrange an interview with the Imam personally. The Imperial Commission, shortly after its arrival in the Yemen, caused the issue of an Irade remitting all arrears of taxes due to the Government up to the end of the Turkish year 1321 (13th March, 1905). These outstanding taxes amount to a considerable sum, especially under the heads “tithes” and “ vergo,” and the chances of their collection at this stage are almost impossible. The release, bv Imperial order, of about 100 political prisoners and rebels, who have been captured since 1905 and confined in the principal fortress at Sana’a for participation in the revolt, has also been brought about on the recommendation of the above Commission. Great dissatisfaction in military circles, especially amongst the higher officers, has been manifested on account of the mistaken leniency shown to these Arab ring leaders, who have given the Turks no end of trouble during the past two years, and w hose arrest was only effected with very great difficulty. [2556 a— 1 ]2 The veteran Field-Marshal exhibited his disapproval of the above unwise measure by immediately recapturing after release formally and reinterning at the capital three of the principal offenders. A wise step towards reform in the administration of this province introduced by the late Commission took the shape of securing an Trade prohibiting the further emplovment in the Yemen of six corrupt and undesirable I£aimakams who have spent a good many years in this vilayet amassing wealth by squeezing the weak tax-f payers. Amongst these I note the names of Mahmoud Ttaoof ot Taweela, his brother Ahmed Adib, late of Rid’a, and Saleh Bey, at present serving at Zebeed. The first named who was imprisoned by Hussain Hilmi Pasha some ten years ago, and released in 1905 by Fezi Pasha, was appointed Kaimakam at Taweela after the recapture of the mountainous district north of Sana’a from the Imam, where he was allowed to run loose and plunder the inhabitants openly till arrested a few weeks ago by General Yussuf Pasha, and sent to the capital in chains after the infliction of a severe whipping. The Commission left Sana’a on the 12th instant for the Taiz district, but wero delayed for several days en route at Ma’abar, about 40 miles south, owing to the activity of Arab bands in the Jahran country. Three battalions were dispatched from Sana’a under Colonel Mustapha Bey to drive off the rebels, who after six days’ skirmishing and severe fighting, w f ere ultimately put to flight, losing heavily. The towns lying in the district caravan route between the capital and Taiz were visited by the Commission, who, after spending a few r days in the Ta’iz itself, proceeded to Mokha, whence they embarked on the Turkish gun-boat “Custamuni” for Hodeidah. The dismissal of Mahmoud Nedim Bey, the Adjoint of the Governor-General, has caused not a little surprise throughout the vilayet, where he has done excellent work. The post of Adjoint w r as created for the first time at the end of 1904, and its incumbent ever since, w r ho exercised great influence amongst the Arab population and with the Imam Syyed Yahya as well, w r as a very able official. The vilayet is now r without a single officer of any administrative ability, and a hint might be given to that effect at the proper quarter. On the 4th instant a Proclamation w r as published here announcing that 1,500 Arabs from El Ushmor, a place 6 or 8 miles westward of Amran, attempted to march on the latter tov r n, but were repulsed and severely punished by General Yussuf Pasha. The Arab losses w ere serious, and included forty men killed of the Hashid tribe. A near relative of the Imam Syyed Yahya, it is reported, w r as also killed in this engagement, and one of his lieutenants, Abdulla-bin-Monsoor, w r as w T ounded. The rebels were led by a notable Sheikh, Nasir Mabkoth. On the 21st instant Field-Marshal Fezi Pasha set out in person, in command of of a force of four battalions and a few r guns, to punish the tribesmen who had rendered the road between Sana’a and Damar unsafe. He surrounded a band of the rebels at a place called Maguela, three to four hours’ march south of the capital, but allowed them to make good their escape during the night. The recent mutinous conduct of time-expired soldiers, reported not long ago, has since been imitated by the officers of the Sana’a garrison. Some 100 junior officers, belonging to the various battalions stationed there, threw down their arms and took up their quarters at the telegraph office. They have collectively telegraphed to the Sultan demanding arrears of salary, which are considerably overdue, and requesting to be relieved of service in this province, where they have already passed several years. | These officers have now T been in possession of the telegraph office for over three weeks, and are anxiously aw r aiting the reply to their Petition from Constantinople. It is feared that the junior officers throughout the Yemen will join the mutineers. With truth and great respect, I have, &amp;c.’ (Signed) G. A. BICHARDSON.ASIATIC TURKEY.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 74 of the 15th and your reply of the 17th instant, I have the honour to report that, after consulting with the Grand Vizier, I communicated to the Sultan through Mr. Lamb and His Majesty’s First Secretary^ Tahsin Pasha, the information which I had received from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeida respecting the seizure of the telegraph office at Sanaa by mutinous officers, giving as my ground for doing so the belief that it was in the Sultan’s interest that he should be informed of any news that might directly affect the critical situation in the Yemen. The First Secretary was not able immediately to see the Sultan, and I have had no message from His Majesty since my communication. I tried to find out from the Grand Vizier whether negotiations had begun between the Palace and the deputation of Sheikhs from the Yemen, to which I referred in my despatch No. 325 of the 3rd instant as having been summoned to Constantinople. His Highness gave me to understand that the matter was outside his sphere, and that he indeed knew nothing beyond the mere fact of the arrival of the Sheikhs on the 14th and their presence at the Selamlik on the 17th. I cannot, however, asseverate the truth of His Highness’ language. From a secret quarter I learn that the Imam’s Mission has presented to the Sultan through an influential Sheikh deputed to negotiate for them, who is probably Abdoul Hu da, the following conditions :— 1. The Imam requires that the Yemen shall be managed by himself, and a certain number of Sheikhs nominated by him, the Government to have the right to appoint a certain number of civil inspectors for control, who are to be honest and just. 2 . The Imam engages to supply during a holy war (“ Djehad ”) 100,000 soldiers fully armed at his expense. 3. The Turkish Government to pay £ T. 8,000 for damage done by English and Italian sailors to the Zambouks belonging to the Imam’s followers. 4. His Majesty’s Government have already offered their assistance and protection to the Imam, but he cannot accept this from “ Nasranis ” (Christians), and requires that the Turkish Government shall send a fleet to defend the Arabian coast so as to prevent altogether relations between Arabs and foreigners. 5. The taxation of the population to be in the hands of the Imam, who, however, would pay a yearly tribute (to be arranged) to the Turkish Government. I am inclined to think this report of what has taken place so far fairly accurate, and the fact that the fourth condition is so absolutely the opposite of what really took place in the autumn of 1905, when the Imam made overtures to His Majesty the King, to which no answer was returned, does not in any way affect my belief, since the conditions might be prompted as well by Arab duplicity as by the fear that the Imam’s proposals had leaked out and were not unknown to the Turks. If the question be referred to the Council of Ministers, as is probable, I believe the Grand Vizier and his colleagues will advocate, as far as they think they can do so without going athwart the Sultan’s personal feelings, the granting of some form of administrative independence which will check, at all events, for a time, the ruinous drain of soldiers and funds required for the Yemen. They are certain, however, to avoid the expression “ autonomy,” which is with good reason hateful to the Sultan, and should I have any direct communication with His Majesty on the subject, I shall use the words “ administrative freedom,” or some similar phrase, rather than autonomy.

Ziver Bey, Vali of Trebizond, has, according to the same report, received urgent orders to come to Constantinople with a view to his being sent to the Yemen. The fact of Ziver Bey having received such orders has also been reported by the Acting British Consul at Trehizond, who stated that the Yali would leave on the 1st instant, and that it was supposed that he was to be given office at Constantinople. The Porte, however, and even the Grand Vizier, disclaimed any knowledge of Ziver Bey’s destination. ASIATIC TURKEY. CONEIDENTIAL. [June 10.] Section 3. [19001] No. 1 (No. 327.) Sir, I HAVE Sir N.

Sir o\A' l V With reference to my Despatch No.^52 of the 30th ultimo, reporting the departure of a special Commission to the Yemen, I have the honour to trans mit, herewith, copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Hodeida announcing the arrival of the Commission, which left immediately for Sanaa. Doctor Richardson states that the general im pression is that the Commission will fail to come to terms with the Iman Yahiya, who, besides his ear lier pretensions, now claims the Kaliphate and is supported by a former rival, Syyed Hassan. Although there does not appear to have been any very serious engagement recently between the rebels and the Imperial Troops, the latter are losingA Field Marsheil Feizi Pasha is experiencing much trouble from his time-expired soldiers and he seems to he too handicapped by lack of money and troops to take the offensive against the insurgents. The Grand Vizier with whom I spoke on the sub ject yesterday is evidently much concerned at the condition of affairs and finds it difficult to in duce the Sultan to adopt and follow any definite policy in the Yemen. I have &amp;c., (Signed) N. R. (VConor.No. H 0 D E I D A, April 27th, 1907. Sir:- Hiring the past six weeks a feeling of restless ness appears to have prevailed in the mountainous districts round about Sana'a, owing to the activity displayed by the Imam's adherents in various quarters This may be more or less attributed to the with drawal of the Turkish reserves throughout the Yemen and the depletion of the Army Corps stationed in this province, that has i£ a measure, buoyed up the tribes with hope, tt&gt; make another attempt to drive the TUrks out. The Vail, Field Marshal Fezi Pasha has repeat edly wired recently to headquarters for money and more troops to preserve order, and I believe, has even threatened to resign if his urgent appeals did not receive attention. This His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir N. R. O'Conor, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.,This has most probably led the Sultan to des patch another commission to Yeman from Constantino ple uv patch up matters with Syyed Yahya and his fol lowers, and thus endeavour to postpone the inevitable day. The transport 'Smyrna' arrived here on the 22nd instant and landed the Imperial commission sent to enquire into the grievances of the Yemen arabs and to arrange a truce with the Imam. —- The Commission consists of Yussuf Mahomed s — Asa'ad Effendi as President, and Generals Hadi and Sabit Pasha, members. Colonel Syyed Mahomed Khobani, a native of Sana'a who has been resident at Constantinople for some little time, accompanied the mission out. The 'Smyrna' is lying in port awaiting the re turn of the above officials whom it will carry back. A large quantity of ammunition and military stores« their destination to-morrow. OT uhe above officials^ General Hadi Pasha was Chief of Staff of the Seventh Army Corps in 1900 and 1901, when he was appointed a Divisional Commander at Hodeida. He is of Arab descent, has received his military education in Germany, and from all accounts is a capable officer, with a good record. During ^ i ’( the three years that he held command here, General Hadi Pasha was very popular and much respected. I learn that the Commission has been given very wide powers to treat with the Imam Syyed Yahya, but the latter's pretension to the Caliphate, and his repeated demands for autonomy and evacuation of Sana'a and the country round about, preclude the I II possibility of an agreement being arrived at, on any p other basis. It is not expected that any satisfactory resultsTime-expired soldiers &amp;t* hocieids. have been causing trouble and dislocating local trade during bhe past two months. These began to arrive here from the middle of February last from all parts of the vilayet, and when they numbered some five hun dred men, attacked the bazaars outside the town. Orders were then sent from Sana'a to the local com mandant to enforce order by firing on the men if they attempted to cause a disturbance. The men were impatient to receive their discharge 'teskhare' an eager to obtain arrears of pay and to be sent away about 880, the ringleaders of the previous disturb ance conferred together and conspired to overpower the local garrison and seize their rifles and three guns. The latuer only consisted of two companies of infantrymen having eight years service in the Yemen who most probably connived at the plans of the mutineers. The project was forthwith carried out during the same night and the next morning the mutineers On March 8th when their number had risen to threatenedthreatened to fire on the town with the three guns in their possession, if their demands were not immed iately granted. At the same time, about seventy Rien were de spatched to seize the wells that are sit uated some two miles uoutside the town, and which supply it with drinking water. The water supply was thus cut off for nearly thirty-six hours after wards. General Arif Pasha commanding at Hodeida had re ceived orders from Sana'a to open fire on the mutin eers, hut in company with the Naih of Hodeida he talked the men over and caused them to return to their quarters after they had heen granted one month's salary and their discharge papers issued to them. Hiring the latter half of March many disorderly scenes w,ere witnessed in the bazaars and several at tempts made to loot. Encounters frequently ensued between these soldiers and the townspeople resulting in some casualties. The shops throughout the tov/n were closed on ten different occasions for fear of thesethese troops, who had begun to despair of being sent back .o their homes, as no transport appeared to be forthcoming. On uhe 15th March an Imperial Irads v/as promul gated to despatch these time-expired men to Akabah. Tney were eventually transported on the let April in the Steamship 'Aseyr', 1,170 men in all, much to the relief of the authorities and the local inhabitants equally. It is rumoured that the men compelled the cap tain of the transport to pass the Canal, and prevent ed him from making for the Gulf of Akabah. It might be mentioned that the men that partici pated in these serious demonstrations and caused a feeling of local uneasiness for more than a month, had served in the Yemen for the past nine or ten years, and had several years' salaries to receive. The recent incidents due to the unusual pro longation of the service of Turkish troops in this province, and the inadvisability of collecting. months before transport is available, of large bodiesof dj.econtented, unpaid anc ill-fed soldiei'u o.t Ho- v/heie the garrison is InadeQuate and foreign and local comniercial interests are at stake, might in future afford food for serious reflection at the s nr ask apij 9 1 1 . Such have had the 1 r ccunt erpart in previous years,, hut each succeeding incident assumes a gi’aver aspect than its predecessor. Early this month, Arabs from the Imam’s follow ing made incursions into Hi fash, a military mountain ous post, situated north-west of Bajl and about a day’s march from it. Reinforcements from the lat ter place and from Hodeida were despatched there and succeeded in driving off the invaders. The raids were repeated with the withdrawal of the force, and a week ago, it was decided to evacuate the position temporarily, where two companies of infantry and one gun had been stationed. The civil officials con sisting of a mudeer and a Nalb, under the jurisdic tion^ of the Hodeida mutasarriflick have also been withdrawn from Hifash since. Two companies of foot-soldiers that hitherto garrisonedgarrisoned the island of Farsan were moved to Model- da not long ago, and for some reason, not easily understood, the island is without civil officials either, and left to the mercy of hedouin raiders. The route between this and Sana'a has been ren dered unsafe during the past month by the activity shown by bands of rebels and numerous attacks cn caravans have been reported. A strong force con voys the weekly post between the capital and Model da and it is even found necessary to send one or two battalions to guard the post between Sana'a and Suk- el-Khamis. The telegraph line has been frequently cut and communication Is generally Intercepted.

I have to inform you that about a year ago, I had received a letter sent to me from the Imam, but by regardless on account of my business I did not send it to you at the same time. Now two days ago a man named Syed Mahomed Ali who is of higher intimacy under the Imam has come and handed over to me a letter from the Imam, the above letters herewith attached to you for knowledge. The above-mentioned Sayid Mahomed Ali said that he was directed by his Master the Imam to see you and communicate certain private affairs which affairs he refused to show us. He now desires to enter Aden and call on you personally for such purpose. He does not wish to stay in the Guest house ; he wishes to he a guest in secret and will stay in the house of Ahmed Koshasha in camp Aden. Oh friend, as this man is, it seems, of high „ . rank I hope that you will treat well on meeting him and hear him and do politics for obtaining news from him.r' Will you please reply to me soon, as he desires that there should be no delay. About the attached letters I hope that they may be translated to you secretly and not be published. J I have, oh fiiend, some news which could not be written now hut on meeting you, if God please, it shall be communicated verbally. Wishing you of sound health. Translation.

Jfter compliments .—We write to inform you of what has taken place between us and the Turks who have clothed themselves in the dress of cruelty amongst the inhabitants of this world, and adorned themselves with ornaments of sin and aggression. When we called upon them to observe the law and the^ constitutional usages, they bit their fingers with disappointment and bent their heads downward in a supercilious manner, as you observe. When the sword was drawn from its scabbard and wielded against them it played deadly havoc and produced on them distress and gloom. They have fallen in the same straits as those who were haughty and arrogant against God. And God has made the right to inherit what the wrong had built, and caused the futility of their misguided actions. When the war was raging and they were pressed hard in every place and corner, and the Arabs had occupied most of their strongholds and fortified places and had advanced on Sana’a and upon the Turks who were inhabiting it, we were moved with compassion, as such tenderness is born in the heart of every good believer; and therefore when we reached Sana’a we communicated with the officials who were there, and on their appeal for peace we accorded it. In accordance with the verses in the ' Koran 44 they were in a bottomless sea surrounded by waves,” and they were within the clutches of their conqueror. They prepared for siege and applied for help from afar. This succour and power they obtained from outside have done them no good but (on the contrary) given rise to the humiliation and disgrace they have been suffering. We ousted them from Sana’a, and extended to them our favour under the terms of the truce which they have proclaimed. We fixed a truce for one year during which there should he no fighting and both parties should have peace without any defiance or violation &lt;&gt;f the terms. When they, however, reached the place to which they had agreed to retire, they reverted to their former deeds admixed with truth and falsehood. They commenced to violate the terms they had concluded and the undertakings they had agreed to, and to commit evil. We did not feel distressed or perplexed at what they committed and practised, but we called upon God to witness against those who paid no heed to conscience and disregarded religion and law. You, oh Sultan, whose lineage has a place in the records of honour and benevolence, will not sleep in the face of this hardship, nor will your nobility tolerate tyranny, or submit to improper or inconsistent things. u The people are recognized by their monarchs ; It is not becoming that the Kings of the Arabs should be Foreigners, j Who are not of right origin or pedigree, Nor have they any faith or conscience ”. We have for a long time been expecting your assistance, that your wealth would be added to ours and your men would also join our men. You might take the first opportunity to join in the race and thus supplement your great respect with such glory as will never be effaced or obliterated. And you lwill have planted a tree of honour which will have longer existence than any other plant in which man has had concern. It is men like you who raise their arms to eminence, and dress in the garments of veneration. We consider you as our friend and as a partisan of the descendants of the prophet. May God allow us to hear good and pleasing news about you and we rely on God. Dated the 23rd Jamad-el-Aioal 1323 {16th July 1905), Translation. Praise be to God, the Merciful and the Compassionate. May God give him victory, Yahia bin Mahomed, the Commander of the Faithful who relies iu Goi, the Lord of the Universe. To— Sultan Ahmed Fadthl. After compliments .—We are in a time which indicates the approaching hour. It it full of evil and wickedness, during which disobedience (of God) has been manifested. The Foreign officials (Turks) have banished the good believers who have been humbled, and they have killed them and taken them captives, thus diminishing their numbers. We have no alternative but to swallow the bitterness of grief and to undergo the terrible ordeal in the cause of the glorious God and to urge the people to uphold the rightful law. We have summoned all the people to aid and support us in our honourable project, {viz.) to raise the Islamic law from its degradation by those who divert and I deviate from its path ; and to remove the oppression exercised by the persons appointed by the Sultan. Those who have a lively faith have answered our request. We have made “ jehad ” (religious war) trusting in the worshipped God. Every one has heard and learnt what lias taken place. When we gained power &lt; ver the officials and regulars (army) we treated all of them with kindness, for the sake of the Sultan of Islam. We accepted peace from them in the best manner, secured them safely and despatched them, their families and their baggage with honour and respect. We personally rose when we heard that something approaching breach of faith was committed by some Arabs (against the Turks) and we inflicted on the offenders the condign punishment ordained by the Glorious God. There was nothing to prevent us from attack- ’ ing and conquering them in Sana’a, but we prevented the leaders of our forces from doing so with a view to pleasing the merciful God and out of regard for the widows, the mfants and for respect of the Sultan, When they 'reached their destination, however, they violated the terms concluded with us and had no respect for the firm convention they had undertaken. But this was not all, for they stretched them necks tovvards ony country. They collected their shattered forces and advanced with a large army, the time of whose discomfiture was near at hand, xhey advanced to ne:ir Shahara and rekindled the fire of war which God had extinguished. What took place was unparalleled in the annals of the past. Hearsay is nqt like eye-witness. They retreated when they saw that their concentrated forces would be annihilated. They continued their pleasures m dissipation and debauchery and in sodomy and in drinkin- of the fountain of all wickedness (&gt;*z.) Ijquor. They were deceived in their defeated army, and they disregarded the reproach of the Blessed God. We despatched several letters to the mighty Sultan through various sources and informed him of the cause of these movements which we were making in succession by lineage (viz.) on account of our religious zeal and in , W , e h °P ed th at these representations would haTt some effect, and we therefore kept quiet for a while and did not send forward the troops to press the officials and their camps, up to now. But there has been no result except that the officials are committing the unlawful fiT M 0rrUp ? P™ 0 , 4 . 106 ? which condemned by God. We now intend to collect the Muocadams (leaders) and to resume the “ jehad,*’ placing our sole confi- support Q th6 tvorshl PP ed God Qu wllom we rely and from whom we obtain/*V\ Sayid Mahomed bin Ali one of our honourable men has come to us and told us that you acknowledge our friendship and act in the way laid down by the eminent Lord, by loving the near relations of the prophet, which behoves ail creatures. As God has stated * nothing is required of you except your befriending the descendants of the prophet.’* The prophet, may the blessing of God be on him, his relations and friends, said (t love God for the prosperity he has bestowed on you j love me lor the love of God j and love my descend - ants for my love.” May the blessing of God be on him, his relations and friends. And he also said “ I shall live with you after my death and so shall the holy book of God and my own relations, which if you adhere to and observe, you shall never go astray. The well-knowing God informed me that they (holy book and relations) shall not part until they come to the fountain (which is in paradise) which is well known.” We have thanked God for the same. Certainly ycu are descended from honourable lineage and endowed with respect and veneration. The Sayid under reference told us of the conversation w hich passed between you and him, and w r e view the same with satisfaction and approval. You may act in what ever way may be possible to aid us and you shall be greatly rewarded by the Glorious God. Such actions are a contribution to the cause of goodness* and piety, and co-operation with us and in the support of the Sharia of the omniscient God who knows all that is hidden and open. We should like to know of any news that you can possibly furnish us regarding the movements of the Sultan in this country and elsewhere. Please remember us to your sons, relations and learned men. May you remain in prosperity. Dated 27th Bajab 1324 {16th September 1906.) Copy of Note of interview dated 2nd November 1906, The Political Resident granted an interview to Sayid Mahomed bin Ali at the Residency Office this morning. The Sayid was accompanied by a certain Nakib Abdulla bin Ayadth A1 Asal. After the interchange of compliments the Political Resident enquired as to the object of the Sayid’s visit to Aden, to which the Sayid replied that he had come on behalf of the Imam Yahis bin Mahomed to propose an alliance between him and the British Government, and to ask for assistance in expelling the Turks from the Yemen. It was desired that this assistance should take the form of money and arms. The Imam had a certain amount of money of course but required more. As to arms he chiefly needed irench Le Gras ammunition. He had already abundance of Mauser and Martini ammunition which had been captured from the Turks. In return for the assistance, the Imam it appeared was willing to enter into an alliance of friendship with the British Government. The Sayid said that the Imam had already received overtures of friendship and alliance from the Governments of Prance, Germany, Italy and Persia. In reply to the Resident’s inquiry, he said that the Imam had received letters from the representatives of those Powers by the hands of certain Arab mes sengers. He did not know who the messengers were. He did not know whence the letters emanated nor who wrote them. He had never seen t e letters. But he was in the Imam’s confidence, and the Iman had told him that he had received these letters and that they formed a bulky file of correspon dence. . The Sayid proceeded to state that the Imam did not desire to enter into an alliance with any of the Powers named but that he did wish to en er m 0 a ii alliance with the British Government, because he heard from all sources thatj they treated all their subjects and friends well—with justice and equity. The Sayid said that he knew nothing of Germany's attitude towards Islam. He knew that the British Government was everyw T here well spoken o , an i was their friendship and assistance that the Imam desired.Asked as to tlie object of the powers who had addressed the Imam, he admitted this might be to obtain territory in Yemen and anyhow that it was probably to obtain some substantial benefit for themselves. The Imam certainly did not desire to see any of them establish themselves in Yemen. When asksd as to whether the Iman was willing to see the British Govern ment so establish themselves, he made it plain that the Imam did not contemplate making any return for the assistance he desired. The Sayid expressed a desire that Sultan Sir Ahmed Eathl should act as j intermediary between the Imam and the British Government. He had recently i met the Sultan and was impressed with his ability and the general excellence 1 of his character, etc. When asked as to the other Imam Sayid A1 Kasmi, who it was rumoured , had set himself up as a rival to the Imam-Yahia bin Mahomed, the S iyid i replied that he was a man of no consequence whatever. / The Sayid also stated in the course of the interview that the Imam tvas I unwilling to accept any terms from the Turks. He was determined to expel ! them altogether from the Yemen, and would be satisfied with nothing else. The Sharif of Mecca was on good terms with the Sultan of Turkey, but the Imam was not willing to accept a position similar to his. It was a position of subordination to the Sultan, and the Imam aimed at complete independence. The Imam had recently been approached by a relation of the Sharif of Mecca and also by Ibn Rashid, the Emir of Mejd. But the negociations had come to nothing. The Imam was determirted to continue the struggle for independence of Turkish rule. He had been pressed to put an end °to the hostilities which had led to so much loss of human life, but he would not rest until the Turks had been expelled from Yemen. ( The Resident informed the Sayid that he would communicate the Imam’s message to Government, and that their reply would be communicated to him in due course. Meanwhile the Sayid stated that his intention was to remain at Lahej. ^ The Sayid said that he had been well treated in Aden and expressed his gratification. He was not very well and would be grateful for medical assistance, which the Resident promised to give him. The interview then terminated. Telegram dated the 10th November 1906.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from Vice-Consul Richardson, repojting his return to Camaran, and giving an account of the situation in the Yemen Vilavet. v I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure*in No. 1. Vice-Consul Richardson to Dr. Hussain. (No. 94.) Sir, Camaran, November 6, 1906. I DULY reported by telegraph to His Majesty’s Embassy my return from Sana’a on 4llfiY8th ultimo at the same time that I wired to you. I was obliged to return directly to Hodeida without visiting Kuttaea and Marawar as intended, owing to the arrival at Camaran of pilgrim vessels from India. I hope to submit in due course some information about the country between Sana’a and Hodeida, and of the principal towns to be met en route. Since my despatch of the 5th September to Sir N. O’Conor, there has been no change in the state of affairs in the vilayet as far as I can learn, and no activity has been shown on the part of the Imam. Amongst other proposals put forward by the Mission under Shereef Hamza of Mecca (referred to in my despatch No. 76 of 5th September, 1906), it would appear from what I inferred from conversation with many prominent Sheikhs and certain Turkish officials, that the Imam rejected one offering him a position in the Yemen under the Turkish Government with a residence at Sana’a, similar to that held at Mecca by the Grand Shereef. He (the Imam) insisted that the basis of an under- standing with the Turks should commence with the withdrawal of the latter to Menakha, in accordance with the Treaty signed at the capitulation of Sana’a in April 1905. I learnt also that a counter-proposition was made by Syyed lahya (the Imam), who suggested that he should administer as the Suzerain of the Sultan, the mount ainous part of the Yemen that formerly belonged to his ancestors, paying tribute to the Ottoman Government. A small Turkish garrison, it was added, would be admitted at Sana’a. Numerous Sheikhs had begun to arrive daily from all parts ever since I took up my residence at Sana’a. These Chiefs, in tendering their submission and avowing their allegiance to the Turkish Government, represented to Eezi Pasha, the Acting Vali, that the Imam had held their sons and kinsmen as hostages ever since the beginning of the general uprising in the vilayet. They declared that it was impossible for them not to assist the Imam while these hostages were held, and begged that steps might be taken to cause them to be released. Some uneasiness must have been felt at head-quarters at the impending departure of all Turkish reserves in the vilayet and their substitution by recruits at the present juncture. The Imperial authorities, thinking that all was goingjwell in the province in spite of the remonstrances of the Acting Vali, had now begun to withhold the periodical remittances of funds. All the above circumstances combined seem to have compelled the Ottoman Government, whether on the advice of Eezi Pasha or not is not quite certain, but most probably at the suggestion of Eerid Pasha, the President of the Reform Com- [2260 A' —4]mission, to approach the Imam with a view to ascertain whether he would receive a Mission from the Yemen Vilayet, with whom he might discuss in a friendly spirit the basis of a peaceful and permanent understanding. The Imam at last agreed to send his representative and a few of his principal followers to Ttaidah, about 30 miles north of the capital, to meet the Turkish Mission consisting of Mahomed Pasha, second member of the Iteform Commission, Mahmoud Nedim Bey, the Adjoint of the Vali, and Ahmed Bey, one of the secretaries at the vilayet. The latter officials left Sana’a on the 7th October for Amran en route to Baidah, that was reached three or four days later. The Mission returned to Sana’a on the 22nd October, hut the result of their negotiations with the Imam is kept secret, although it is not expected that much could have been accomplished. The Acting Vali informed me a few days prior to my departure that the Mission was sent to the Imam to induce him to cease hostilities that were a source of blood shed on both sides, without any apparent advantage to either; secondly, to arrange about the release of the Arab hostages held by him, and, lastly, to cause him to return to the Turks the guns, rifles, and ammunition taken from Sana’a. These proposals seem absurd, considering that the Turks have not been able to attain their ends by military operations during the past eighteen months, in spite of a considerable force at their disposal. About a fortnight ago, I learnt that a messenger had just returned to Hodeida from a visit to the new Imam at Sada, Syyed Hassan-el-Kasimi, where he had been sent by the local authorities through Syyed Ahmed-es-Sherai of Hodeida, to convey a present of 20,000 dollars, Maria Theresa (2,200/.), to assist him in his projected opera tions against Syyed Yahya. It would appear that the former has now sent a request to the Field-Marshal to supply him with two guns and a force of Turkish troops to enable him to successfully oppose his rival, to which Fezi Pasha replied that he would ask instructions from Constantinople. I take this opportunity of bringing to notice, and of expressing my thanks to the Acting Governor-General and his Adjoint, as also to the President of the Reform Commission, for their marked courtesy to me during my stay at Sana’a, to whom also must he attributed the success of my visit for the kind assistan ce they caused to be rendered me during my movements.

O’Conor’s despeatch No. x 542 of the 8 th August, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch, from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeidah, reporting his arrival at Sana’a, and giving an account of the country and of the inhabitants, as well as his impressions of the Vali, Marshal Eezi Pasha. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 1 . Vice-Consul Richardson to Sir N. O’Conor. (No. 76. Confidential.) gii^ Sana’a, September 5, 1906. I AM in receipt of your Excellency’s despatch of the 10th August, that reached me here yesterday, approving of my proposed tour in the Yemen and my annual summer visit to Sana’a. Unfortunately , owing to pressure of work at Hodeidah and being single-handed, I was unable to leave Hodeidah at the end of July as intended. I started out on my journey on the 21 st ultimo as telegraphed to Constantinople, and after spending two days en route reached the capital safely on the 81st. The Adjoint of the Governor-General, Mahmoud Nedim Bey, who has been officiating as Mutessarif of Hodeidah during the past three months, and was about to rejoin his appointment, accompanied me on the journey and afforded me every assistance and facility. An adequate escort was provided as usual, and thanks to the courtesy of the Vali, Marshal Fezi Pasha, orders had been sent to the civil and military officials in all the towns through which I passed, to accord me a fitting welcome and to icceive me hospitably. On arrival I paid the usual official visits to the Vah and Commander-in-chief, Ahmed Fezi Pasha, the Inspector-General of the vilayet, and President of the Yemen Reforms Commission, Ferid Pasha, and to the Adjoint of the ^ ali respectively, which were duly returned. . 1 was present by invitation on the 1 st instant at the celebration of the anniversaiy of the accession to the throne of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, which took the foim of a ceremonial parade of all troops in garrison, followed by a icception, at which I attended and offered my congratulations officially. This being my fourth visit to Sana’a, I am inclined to think that the local authorities have to a certain extent abandoned their formei idea that such aie undertaken with some secret motives bearing a political signification. It i* most obvious that they should do so, considering the suspicious nature of the link geneially, the fact that no foreign Consul has ever resided at or visited Sanaa, and in t ic ace of the important and occasionally conflicting interests possessed by the Butis i Government on the south-eastern frontier of this Ottoman Province. The majority of officials have now come to regard my annual visit here as one resorted to with the view of escaping from the trying and enervating climate of Hodeidah. ^ ^ , r I do not think that the Porte would raise much objection to the establishment of a Consulate here at any future period should His Majesty’s Government so desire, since the vilayet has received me officially, consented to receive official correspondence sent to it from here, and accepted to treat with me on business affecting British interests and questions raised by the Vice-Consulate at Hodeidah. .. . Owing to the delay in starting, and proximity of the Indian pilpimage necessitating my presence at Camaran soon after the 15th Octobei, I find that I sha 1 [2174 7/-3J2 have to abandon the proposed trip to Ta’iz and Mokha, relegating same to some future occasion. In returning, I hope to pass through Kuttai and Marawar, which places I have never visited before. I shall reserve my report on the places traversed en route till I return lo Hodeidah, hut take the liberty to make certain observations on the country and its inhabitants from a political point of view. ^ The line of communication between Hodeidah and Sana’a along the caravan route is ^ secure and adequately garrisoned, some six or seven battalions being utilized for the purpose. Four other battalions are distributed along the Sanfur route, viz., between Obal, Aniz, and Mefaq. There are about a dozen guns altogether, mounted on the prominent heights between Hujjeila and Sana’a, where military posts have been established. Twelve battalions of infantry, in all 3,000 men strong, two batteries of field artillery consisting of four guns each, and two mountain batteries, with two squadrons of regular and one of irregular cavalry, comprise the Sana’a garrison. The capital has a large fort, and five guard-stations situated on the surrounding hills that overlook and command the city, where big guns are mounted. There is a force of two infantry battalions at Rauda, 4 miles north of this, with two field guns. Amran and Hajje are also strongly fortified and garrisoned. It is expected that twelve battalions of redifs, that mutinied a few months ago, will be shortly sent home when fresh drafts arrive. News received points to a fairly quiet state of affairs in the vilayet just now, no activity on the part of the Imam or the rebels being reported from any quarter since my arrival. At Suk-el-Khaamis on the 28th ultimo, 1 learnt that Liwa Yussif Pasha had surprised the insurgents near Dhafir about a week previous and had succeeded in killing and capturing nearly 200 of them. A number of Sheiks throughout the disturbed area have tendered their submission to the Commander-in-chief recently and continue to do so, but the good faith of these Chiefs is questionable, in view of past experience. This submission is not so voluntary as it may appear to be, being induced by the offer of sums of money from the local treasury. The surrender of arms is also proceeding, but a considerable stock must still be remaining in the hands of the Imam. Both the civil and military officials generally are now dissatisfied with their lot in I lie Yemen, and 1 have been informed by an official in high authority that the local authorities would be glad, under present circumstances, to abandon the mountainous part of this province, which is held under great difficuliies and at considerable expense and tr ouble. I he Field-Marshal, Ahmed Fezi Pasha, who has served, at various intervals, over thirty vpnrs in the \emen, has hinted to me the hopelessness of the situation in the vilayet, unless the Imperial authorities remit funds regularly and the Sultan decides to build the proposed railway between Hodeidah, Sana’a, and Amran. I he &lt; ommander-in-chief—who must be quite 80 years of age—though a kind, hospitable old man, is unfortunately a very avaricious official, who left the Yemen some eight years ago, it is said with nearly a million sterling, having enriched himself at the expense of the public revenues. It is an open secret here that he has not abandoned his corrupt practices, and that he has helped himself liberally to the large remittances from Constantinople with the same avhh band that he dispensed presents to the different Arab Sheikhs and tribesmen surrendering to him. It wen Id give the impression to one in conversation with him, and from the opinion of t o^e who should know, that, being quite disgusted with the state of affairs here, he would be l lad to sell the country to any Power strong enough to hold it. Rnlliant military services under arduous circumstances, rendered to his country in the ])as&gt; in the time of urgent need, have now begun to tell on his advanced years and iron constitution, and signs of impaired mental ability are quite visible in the old Field- Marshal. I e population of the hilly districts has to a great extent disappeared, and whole villag* s remain deserted and desolate as the result of the prolonged drought and rebellion. ^ ® Sana’a lias lost many of its charms, and now presents a dismal appearance, with its gardens and houses partially destroyed, and the latter to a considerale extent uninhabited.3 the^iegeflast year.”' 0 '' ^ half P 0 &gt; ,ulation has becn 'viped out through famine and The Jews in particular have suffered terribly. Barely 800 now remain at Sana’a out of a total popu at,on formerly of 7,000. Of the latter nearly 1,000 have emigrated to Hodeidah and other places; the remainder have died within the past two years This sect, unlike their fraternity throughout the world, do not practise usury, but follow manual and other pursuits, and are artisans, porters, domestic servants, and goldsmiths in this city. A good many are also merchants and tradesmen. They have been fairly fortunate here under the Turks, who do not particularly persecute them, but merely exact a fixed sum annually from the community for exemption from military service. J . Arabs in the mountains though quiet, are discontented with Turkish adminis tration, and it is believed srenerally that they will rise again and join the Imam when a suitable opportunity presents. There has been a very good rainfall throughout the Turkish sphere of Yemen. The dhuira crops in the Tehama, and the coffee and barley in the mountains near Menakha are flourishing, but rain is still wanted in the capital itself. It is very noticeable that a large area of arable ground near Sana’a, formerly under cultivation, has been abandoned by its agricultural proprietors, who must either have died or run away. Living is very expensive at present in the capital owing to high transport rates between this and Hodeidah. Trade appears to be in a very depressed condition: cattle and oxen are scarce in the mountains, and have to be imported from the plains. Farmers are at the same time very reluctant to sell their animals or slaughter them for food, as there are not sufficient to meet local agricultural requirements. ^About a month ago Sherif Hamza, a nephew of the Grand Shereef of Mecca, arrived at Hodeidah via Zaidyia from Kuflet-Izhar, the Imam’s capital, where he had been on a visit to the latter. This journey was undertaken at the request of the Grand Shereef apparently, but in reality at the express command of the Sultan, with a view to causing the Imam to come to some arrangement with the Turks and to abandon his hostile attitude. Sherif Hamza returned shortly afterwards to Mecca, but the result of his mission is kept dark, although 1 believe that the Imam refused to come to an understanding, profiting, no doubt, from his experience of the good faith of the Turks in the execution of the terms of the Treaty signed at the capitulation of Sana’a in April, 1905.

About two months ago this Commission, consisting of Hamza-el-Feer (Kaimakam of Grand Shereef at Mecca in the time of the late Grand Shereef Husain Pasha), his son, Shereef Aaid, and Abdur Rahman Bias, one of the most distinguished Ulemas of Medina, was sent overland with a guard of fifteen Shereefian soldiers to Yemen, with instructions to see the Imam of Y'emen, without having any communication with Ahmed Faizi Pasha, or any other authorities in Yemen. The Commission proceeded to Saada and informed the Imam of their object, and was received by the Imam with great courtesy and politeness. The members of the Commission had more than one interview with the Imam, and conveyed the message of the Grand Shereef with the object of persuading him to come to terms with the Turkish Government and to desist from further hostilities, and to ask him to return to the authorities all the military stores that had fallen in the hands of the Arabs at Sanaa and other places. It is said the Imam’s reply was that he himself had no desire to continue hostilities against the Turks, and was anxious to put an end to all bloodshed and be a faithful friend of the Turkish Government; but he was not free to exercise his own will in matters like that, and had to be guided by the wish of the community who had selected him Imam ; and the slightest inclination on his part to depart from the edict of the community would be a signal for his fall, disgrace, and the election of another Imam. As to restoring the military stores, the Imam knowing well the inability of the Commission to carry away the heavy pieces of artillery, said the pieces of artillery were of no use to him and he can hand them over to the Commission if they can carry them back, but the rifles and rifle ammunition were distributed among the tribes and it was beyond his power to get them back. The Commission, as expected by the Imam, did not accept the offer. The Imam has sent a sealed letter with the Commission to the Grand Shereef, and its contents hate not transpired. Abdur Ralnnan Ilias has mentioned to people here that Ahmed Faizi Pasha has asked the Porte for 80,000 troops to relieve the discontented troops now in Yemen and to carry out his design of besieging Shahara, the stronghold of the Imam. Abdur Rahman Ilias seems confident that the Imam and his followers would not be able to show much resistance after this. I have, &amp;c.

The Resident advises that omission to answer the letter will probably be construed as an insult; but I am further to suggest that the terms of the answer referred to in paragraph 2 of the Despatch from the Secretary of State are possibly not very happy in the present condition of Yemen as it might appear to the Imam that the despatch of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan’s commission has not tended and is not likely to tend to the welfare and contentment of the Yemen. I am to suggest that it would probably be sufficient simply1 simply to say that the letter has been received but that the British Government cannot interlere with questions of internal administration arising in Turkish territory. 3. With reference to paragraph 3 of the despatch, on which opinion is invited, it is not possible to say that the influence of the Imam with the Aden tribes is sufficiently powerful to render an answer imperative as &amp; matter of policy. The Imam is a Shiah and the Aden tribes are Shafai Sunnis and though owing to their hatred of the Turks they would wel come the success of the Imam yet should peace be restored, in such sense as to leave the Imam our neighbour at Taiz, the differences of creed will probably suffice to prevent the Imam obtaining any powerful influence amongst them, 4. I am further to suggest that if a reply to the Imam's letter is to be sent it would be desirable that any further delay should be if possible avoided. I am thereiore to suggest that any further instructions may be obtained by telegram. 5 # Lastly I am to say that if it be decided to send a reply Major Jacob can procure a trustworthy messenger and send the lett.r by a North Sast route which would avoid all risk of the cooeunioation falling into Turkish hands* I have, etc•, Sd/- S.

In considering the advisability of return ing an answer to the Imam’s communication, it must, I think, be borne in mind that whether the reply is made verbally or in writing its substance is certain in time to reach the ears of the Ottoman Authorities and the fact that a correspondence has passed be tween His Majesty’s Government and the principal leader of the revolt in Yemen will lend colour to the promiscuous reports which have been so sedulously cir culated •^ le Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. rlf • circulated from Egypt and elsewhere of English in- trlgues in Arabia, and cannot fail to accentuate the distrust o'f our policy, and the suspicions of our intentions towards Turkey which are unfortunate ly entertained in certain quarters at Constantino ple . Should, on the other hand, it he thought ad visable not to disregard the communication of a prominent religious leader whose influence even in the event of the collapse of the present insurrec tion, may remain a powerful factor among the tribes which border the Aden Hinterland, I think the best course would be not to answer the letter in writing but if a suitable opportunity offers, to send a ver bal reply. 1 would venture to suggest that the tenour of tne reply should he to the effect that the all Power ful Government of His Royal and Imperial Majesty the King of England has heard that His Imperial Majesty ..lie Sul .an, n.as recently sent a Commission to the YemenYemen to listen to the complaints of the inhabitants and to adopt such measures es will be most likely to conduce to their welfare and contentment. Such an answer, even if it be found indispensa ble to put it in writing, will show the Imam and his followers that their fate is not a matter of in difference to His Majesty's Government, and if the communication falls into the hands of the Turkish Authorities cannot justify the suspicion that Eng land has given the insurgents in the Yemen any encouragement or assistance in their revolt against the Ottoman Administration.

But our object was in no wise worldly supremacy, nor ultimate bodily comfort and luxury, nor do we rely on the hoarded gold or abundance of gain, nor aspire to more than we already possess of nobility of lineage ; but we have seen that the officials were not giving Allah His due, nor respecting His laws nor those of the Prophets of Allah, but they have rather set up unto themselves a religion that was offensive to the sight of Allah and antagonistic to His laws, committing every kind of transgression, and leading to the participation therein all those of our people who came in contact with them, violating Allah by the drinking of wine, obscene relations with males, and every kind of fornication ; they have oppressed the weak, insulted and degraded the noble, until posterity was corrupted, and the word of the Jews and Christians rose high, and the Kurds and Ethiopians ruled the people. They have discarded every regard for the faithful, and lost every feeling of benevolence and pity towards the Moslems. Therefore, seeing that the will of Allah was unavoidable, we have invoked His help, and putting our trust in Him, we began earnestly the fight, acting thus in accordance with the command of Allah the Most High, 44 And light them, so that there should be no more conflict, and the Faith remain for Allah alone ; ” and His saying : “ And let it be a nation calling unto righteousness and preaching against wrong, and these shall prosper,” and His saying: 44 You were the best nation ever produced on earth, ordering good, and warning against evil; ” and in fear of what Allah the Most High has threatened us with in His saying: 44 Pie cursed by the tongues of David, and Esau, the son of Miriam, the unbelievers through their transgressions. They would not refrain from evil, nor stop thereat, cursed be their doings.” Also the saying of him on whom be the prayer and peace of Allah : 4t Thou shall order good, and warn against evil,” and 44 May Allah place over you the wicked among you, the good and righteous shall cry, but they shall not be heeded.” And at the end thereof the letter argues in its own favour, and espouses its own cause. For we cannot too vitally believe that if the victorious Sovereign (may Allah thereby exalt Islam) were to be acquainted with those outrages, about the reality of which no ond can differ, he would be moved by the noble zeal of the Faith and retrieve the past, and redress the wrong that has been committed against the Prophet’s descendants, without whom no intercession can be worthy. As it is, they—meaning the Government officials get alienated more and more from the Faith, and indulge more grossly than ever in every form of vice. And if thou shouldest say, oh, Saied, that these outrages are fearfully permitted to Islam, and that the commission thereof is allowed to the followers of the law of the Loul of Cieation, yet none but the blind can assert this, and if thou shouldest deny, oh, baied, that the heirs of the Prophet are themselves the evidence in essence and detail, the saying ot the Alost High cries to thee, 4 ‘ and we have bequeathed the Book to those whom we have chosen of our servants. Some of these have wronged themselves, others weie prophets, but others still have excelled in bounty by the grace of Allah, and this is the greater virtue. And his other saying (may he be exalted), 44 Say, I ask not of you anything for him save the affection of relationship,” and his saying (may the piayers and peace of Allah be on him) : 44 1 leave amongst you that which, if you were3 to follow, would never make you err after me the Rnnlr nf „ i , People of my house.

And flight from the foe as the worst indignity. Will he who defeated you have victory without the Merciful 0 The infidels are deluded, for if Allah be on your side none shall conquer you and if he defeats you, who will giant you a victory after Him P “ if you support Allah, He will support you, and make firm your feet,” “and we desire the help of those who had been thought weak in the world to make them a nation that will inherit the earth, and that, if we continue to strengthen them on the earth, will keep up prayers, make charity, preaching the good, and turning people away from evil, and to Allah is the end of all things.” Now our trust in the promise of our Lord is firm, and the end is for the pious. Thou dost find in our land but the faithful, bent on the worship of Allah wh.en the night lets down its wings, or reading the Book of Allah when the dawn raises its sheet of light upon the world. Our places of worship are always full of men of learning and action, and our hearts are devoid of cowardice, and do not know discomfiture. Still do we not boast as others do of the costly and fine appliances of war, or of training legions of soldiers, who, however, succumb under our orders ; but rather do we discard the pride of power and strength, and cling humbly to the sacred folds of the robe of the Imamet and the Prophecy. Saplings that throve on the soil of virtue. Then blessed by the Prophets and Califs of Allah. Their banner is their column of dust upsoaring. High emblem of powerful protection and friendship. We have exposed to thee, oh, Saicd, our way as well as the doings of our enemies : “ AY ho of the two parties is deserving peace, if you know ? ” Those who believed, and veiled not their faith with injustice, these have peace, and they are rightly led.. And if the great Sultan were to know the reality of things he would hasten to our assistance now and always, and withdraw all his servants from the Yemen Province to order them rather to fight the infidel nations. Aye, he would forbid them to fight against the descendants of the Prophet, who are, so to speak, part of the sacred person of Mahommed, paying thus worthy tribute to our great and holy ancestor, as ordained in the famous text: u Say, I will not ask of you,” &amp;c. And let not the sajdng of the last of the Prophets be applicable to him: &lt;£ He who shall fight against us in latter days shall he as him who shall fight with the infidels.” Nor the other saying of the Prophet : “ I am war to those whom you fight, and peace to those with whom you are at peace. Arid Allah has ordained that one should be on the side of the righteous by His saying: “ Oh, you who believe, fear Allah and be with the righteous.” The believers^ are those who believe in Allah and His prophets, and who do not doubt, but have sacnficed then belongings and their persons in the way of Allah. Those who are the righteous saj this is my path; I call unto Allah with enlightened eyes and mind, 1, and those who follow me. May Allah be praised, and I am not of those who include others than Allah in their worship. Oh, people, answer the call to Allah, and believe in I mi. evi orgive you your sins and deliver you from eternal torture. And he who wi no respon ro ic call unto Allah will be among the weak of the earth, for no other servant will lie have for successor. “ Oh, people, why do I call you to deliverance am ^ou ca me unto fire ? ” If thou dost see, oh, Saied, any escape from the commandments of Allah, show us the way in the Book of Allah and the law of the Prophet of Allah and put aside threat and intimidation, for then the following saying would apph to the circur - stance “ A brother came with brandished sword ; Thy cousins, too, some swords possess.As to union and solidarity based on truth, bow are we to get that ? It is the most worthy path for us to walk in, stopping, as it shall then, the torrents of blood that flow, and arresting the progress of evil, hut we can only ask the Most High to turn away from the Mahommedan nation all those evils and trials, and cause i ° Y 10 ^ n( ie Book and the House of the Prophet, intrusted with the message ot Allah unto man, delivering us from the strifes and divisions of Satan the hateful. Mav Allah be our only Guide, and blessed is such guidance. And it would have better behoved the great Sultan to consider the Yemen Province as one of the many provinces that he has left in the hands of the infidels, and which he has not since reclaimed. , , , • •*, But it is to the Yemen Province that we see them now hastening with arms, the province which lies in the hands of the children of the Prophet of Allah, who maintain therein the laws of Allah, and oppose the deeds that He has forbidden by His law.

As he entertains some doubt, however, whether his letters have ever reached their destination, he hopes that His Majesty the King, whose dominions at Aden adjoin his own, will be good enough to inform the Sultan how matters stand, and to mediate with him, with a view to a settlement being arrh ed at.

Jfter compliments.—Y ou must have heard of what has befallen the people of Yemen during the past many years and of how the oppression of the officials has resulted in the poverty and deaths of the majority of the population. These officials have faded to observe the tenets of Mohamedan Law They have exceeded all bounds and they have perpetrated unlawful deeds in open disregard of the ordinary ctates of decency. Time after time the people of Yemen have sought our protec-tton as in former cays they appealed to our predecessors to save them from their misfortunes and to protect them against the constant injustice to which they were repeatedly subjected. Our appeals to the Government were of no avail. No help was given to the sufferers: no heed was paid to their complaints. No wise men were sent to effect reform. Agriculture, trade, and industries have been ruined and suffering has been universal and widespread. And so at length the people have of necessity appealed to us and besought us to espouse their cause. They came to us prepared and willing to die in search of relief from the oppres sion and distress and ignominy to which they have been for so long subjected. You must have heard how most of these officials have now been forced to retreat from the positions which they occupied and to retire from the Capital of Yemen under the terms which we granted them with a view to the prevention of further bloodshed. We treated them with kindness and respect as we believe that you must have heard. We have several times addressed His Majesty the Sultan explaining to him the causes which compelled us to fight against our oppressors namelv their non- observance of the Islamic Law and their disregard of the rights of civilization and humanity. We have reminded him that the district of Yemen was formerly under the control of our ancestors, who dispensed justice and satisfied the needs of the people and we informed him that it was only this position which we ourselves desired to occupy and that we were willing to recognize his suzerainty and submit to the will of Providence. We hear however that our letters have been kept back and never been deli vered to the Sublime Porte. We now therefore address Your Majesty in the hopes that you will inform His Majesty the Sultan of the circumstances of our case and explain our views to him. We make this request in view of the fact that Your Majesty’s dominions are near to Yemen, and that we are therefore neighbours. We have heard of the love which you entertain for all human beings high and low and of the regard which you pay to their safety and comfort. We abhor bloodshed and we desire to as far as possible avoid it. Should we attain our desire for the peaceful possession of this district, as it was possessed by our^ ancestors through your mediations, we shall regard your action as great and glorious and we shall most highly esteem it. Otherwise we are determined to defend ourselves, placing our faith in the strength of the Almighty God. And the war will inevitably continue and manv lives will be lost and many habitations will be destroyed. The favour of a reply is requested and we shall welcome it. uaicu /\uen, me i yew ^ i.u &amp; usi 1 yuj. From-COLONEL R. I.

Foreign Office, / IVK«. , TQOS .'i CONFIDENTIAL, Director of Military Operations to Foreign Office.—(Received May 25.) THE Director of Military Operations presents his compliments to the Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and forwards for his information a Memorandum on the state of affairs in Arabia, in view of the present disturbed state of some of the Turkish provinces. Winchester House, St. James’s Square, London, May 24, 1905. Inclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum respecting the State of Affairs in Arabia. THE revolt in Southern Arabia against the Sultan of Turkey seems to be reaching an acute stage, and may prove to be an event of more than local importance. 2 . Of the three Fed Sea coast provinces of Turkey—Hejaz, Asir, and Yemen— Hejaz, tho northern province, is the most important, for it contains the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Asir, the central, is a wild and inhospitable region, and is largely peopled by Arab tribes of the Shia sect of Mahommedans who do not acknow ledge the Sultan as Kaliph. Yemen, a comparatively fertile country with a fairly good climate but largely peopled also by Shia Arabs, was first occupied by the Turks in the sixteenth century. Later on it was governed by a succession of Imams, semi priest rulers descended from the Prophet. The period of Imam government lasted till 1872 , when the Porte reasserted its direct rule; since this time the Turks in their dealings with the tribesmen have had more or less constant trouble, caused both by religious differences and by the incompetence and rapacity of the Turkish officials. 3. The dangerous Arab revolt of 1892 was only temporarily quelled by a lavish expenditure of Turkish troops and money, and broke out again in 1903, spreading also to Asir province; as a result of the defeat in 1903, Turkish rule in Asir is now practically limited to the Fed Sea littoral. In 1901 the Yemen revolt assumed a more acute form and has now resulted in the loss to the Turks of Sana, capital of the Yemen (captured April 1905), and of the control of almost the whole of the interior of that province. Menakha, an artillery depot of some importance, containing a garrison of about 5,000 Turks, is now closely besieged, and is expected to fall. The fatest reports, however, indicate that some Albanian troops have succeeded in rein forcing this town. 4 . The semi-official German Press has asserted that the present Arab revolt , against the Sultan is the result of a deep laid scheme on the part of the British Government to pave the way for British supremacy in the Arabian Peninsula, and eventually to proclaim a Protectorate over Koweit and Bussorah. The Military Attache at Constantinople reports that no opportunity of impressing the Porte with this view has been wasted, a proceeding which may be attributed to the fact that an independent or semi-independent Arabian Empire would certainly menace German interests in connection with the Baghdad Bailway scheme. 5 # The Arab revolutionary movement is not confined to the Yemen only: in 1904 insurrections of varying degrees of importance against Tuikish lule oi pieten - sions took place both in Central Arabia and Mesopotamia and, to a lesser extent, in other parts, and these still continue: up to date, however, there appears to be no definite indication of a concerted and general Arab rising against the Sultan. _ 0. In Central Arabia, Feizi Pasha, who commanded the Turkish expedition from Baghdad against Ibn Sand, and lately succeeded in effecting a junction near Hail with another Turkish force dispatched from Medina, has been transferred to the Yemen as Commander-in-chief. As a consequence of these expeditions, Mesopotamia and Hejaz were to some extent denuded of troops. In Mesopotamia some of the tribes have lately risen in insurrection but details are not available. [1973 66—2] ^4 H 47. It is difficult to estimate the numbers of the Yemen rebels : they lately defeated the Sana relief column, consisting of 5,000 men and eight mountain batteries, and are now in occupation of most of the interior of the Yemen Province, having captured the Turkish garrisons. Some reports estimate their numbers at 20,000 armed men with about thirty Turkish field guns. They are armed with Martinis or captured Mannlichers, and are reported to have captured large stores of ammunition. 8 . Large Turkish reinforcements (consisting mainly of Syrian and also of Albanian troops) should have by now arrived at Hodeida. Further reinforcements are under orders from Macedonia, Armenia, and Syria, but, owing to the unpopularity of the war, the men are not coming in readily, and difficulties in transport arrangements have also caused delays. In addition, the Syrian troops have proved unsatisfactorv and are often mutinous. 9. The successful \ ali of L scub (Macedonia), Shakir Pasha, has been sent to Yemen with 50,000/. to bribe the Arab Chiefs to submit: to judge bv former similar attempts at buying olf the insurgent leaders, the prospects of success of this Mission are not very great. Shakir Pasha’s departure may not improbably be detrimental to the maintenance of comparative order in this part of Macedonia. . J ^ s a ^ )m e stated, Feizi Pasha has been appointed to the chief military command m the lemen, and is now en route thither; he was noted in the 1892 Yemen rebellion or ns policy of brutal repression, and his transfer to the Yemen may militate against the success of the expedition in Central Arabia. 3 1 m 1- - 18 t hat the'J’urks propose sending an expedition to Sana vift Mocha and Tam, but, whether the lurks march on Sana via Taeiz, or via Menakha, it seems certain that they will.encounter considerable opposition. 12. The situation of the Turks in the Yemen is now critical. The drafting of regular troops from Turkey in Europe to Yemen is being watched by Bulgaria with considerable interest and the partial denudation of troops of Hcjaz, Syria, and - eso potamia for the Yemen may have serious consequences in these provinces. 13. ,Finally, should the present Yemen revolt spread to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and should the Imam proclaim himself the true Kaliph in opposition to the Sultan of Turkey-a not impossible contingency, for the Imam is a more direct descendant of the Prophet than the Sultan—it is difficult to see how far the wave of fanaticism may not carry him.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 317 of the 9th instant, I have the honour to inclose herewith copies of two despatches from Mr. Richardson, His Majesty’s \ ice- Consul at Hodeida, reporting on the state of affairs in the Yemen, and giving an account of the capture of Sana’a by the Imam and its evacuation by the Turkish troops and civil authorities. Mr. Richardson mentions that the Syrian Redifs previously stationed at Menakha have been moved south to Hujjeila, and have been replaced by 2,000 fresh Albanian troops and three Turkish battalions transferred from the Anis district. In an earlier despatch Mr. Richardson reported that the steam-ship “ Kossewo ’ arrived on the 29th ultimo with 1,290 Albanian soldiers, and that the steam-ship “ Gharb ” disembarked 2,500 more under the command of Liva Ahmed Fezi Pasha on the 1st instant, and in the despatch which I now inclose, dated the 4th May, he states that in all eight battalions of Albanian troops have been landed at Hodeida, and that it has been decided to station them at Menakha. Reports respecting the position of the Turkish garrison at Ibb have been somewhat contradictory, but it has now been ascertained that it has been successfully relieved. I have/&amp;c. (For the Ambassador), (Signed; FRANCIS STRONGE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Vice-Consul Richardson to Consul Devey. gj r ^ Hodeida, April 28, 1905. NEWS reached me on the morning of the 25th instant that the garrison at Sana’a had surrendered to the Imam, and which was circulated later throughout the town that day, in spite of the authorities remaining reticent on the subject. The above information has now been confirmed, and I learn that the capital actually fell on the evening of the 20th instant. , It would appear from details that have filtered through to Hodeida that aii the troops and Ottoman officials, including the Vali and Commander-in-chief, have been permitted to leave for Hodeida, under a guarantee from the Imam for their safe conduct. ... • i jp n n All forts, guns, rifles, ammunition, military stores, transport animals, Ac., ana all public buildings at Sana’a, I believe, have been taken over by the Imam, under the terms of capitulation. j Foreign and other merchants resident at the capital have been assured that they may continue trading, without fear or molestation, and have elected to reside there. About 2,000 persons, consisting of civil and military officials and their tamiiies, have already arrived at Menakha en route to Hodeida. „ . u • i Preparations are being made for the reception and accommodation of the higher /jr* * 1 C It cannot be imagined where the few thousands of officials and military officers will be housed, as Hodeida can barely offer a couple of houses suitable for residence. The military authorities will experience considerable difficulty about the disposal of several thousand troops more. I hear that a camp will most probably be established at C a'are rumours afloat that Menakha is about to be invested if such has not been already efleeted by the insurgents from the north. Though well provisioned and capableof a stout resistance, the above place will, in my opinion, fall sooner or later [1973/—2]into the hands of the Arabs, owing to the unreliability and mutinous character of its Syrian garrison, many of whom are deserting daily- Should that not unlikely contingency occur which I apprehend, it would take the Turks quite six months or even more to recover their position in the Yemen, and only if an army of 50,000 men, well equipped and provisioned, were landed with adequate transport and provided with a sufficiency oi funds. Besides Menakha, the only mountain fastnesses that remain under Turkish occupation are Kufl, in the Hujjur district, which has been besieged for the past three or four months, Ta’iz, and Ibb. 'Fhe 2,000 Albanian troops that have arrived for service are at present quartered at Hujjeila. Two battalions of the above, while proceeding to Menakha, were attacked by Arabs, and after suffering some loss succeeded in driving off the rebels, and then retired to Hujjeila. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. A. RICHARDSON. Tnclosure 2 in No. 1. Vice-Consul Rickard son to Consul Devey. (No. 53.) Sir, Hodeida, May 4, 1905. SINCE the fall of Sana’a, reported in my despatch No. 50 of the 28th ultimo, which fact has since been officially confirmed, no news of importance has reached this Vice-Consulate. According to information received here, it would appear that the Imam has allowed the Turks a period of fifteen days in which to vacate the capital. Some difficulty was at first experienced in obtaining transport for the large number of officials, troops, and their families, but this has now been solved by the Local Government remitting 5,000/. to the Imam, who has consented to supply the necessary transport animals. Two caravans have so far reached Menakha, the first consisting of some 3,500 soldiers under General Izzat Pasha, who was erroneously reported as being killed some time ago ; and the second of civil and military officers, women, and children, numbering about 2,000 in all. Two other caravans will start from Sana’a in the course of the next few days, the Cali and other high officials arriving by the last. Fhe Mutessarif of Hodeida, who for some obscure reason, unaccountable even by the Adjoint Yali himself, who accompanied Riza Pasha’s force to Sana’a, and has absented himself from his post during the past three months, when his presence at Hodeida was indispensably necessary, returned to Menakha a week ago. All is quiet at present in the neighbourhood of the latter place. 'Fhe Syrian Redifs garrisoning Menakha have been moved south to Hujjeila, and their place taken by the 2,000 Albanian soldiers recently arrived and three old battalions of Turkish troops that were formerly in the Anis district. b p to date, eight battalions of Albanian troops have landed at Hodeida, and it has been decided to station these at Menakha. The Commander-in-chief of all troops in Yemen, Riza Pasha, who has only held that post since March, has been superseded, and Marshal Ahmed Fezi Pasha been appointed to reconquer Sana’a and restore order in Yemen. I he above officer is now r somewhere near Medina, having just successfully concluded an expedition against Ibn Sao’od, the Sheikh of JebaLShammar. Marshal Ahmed fezi Pasha, who has completed the greater part of his service in this province, came here in 18&lt;.3 as a Captain, and attained the rank of Major-General in 1887. He commanded the force that was dispatched to the Yemen in 1892 to relieve Sana’a and retake the various towns captured during the last Arab rebellion headed by the late Imam during that year. He subsequently held for a period of seven years the dual position of Governor- General of the Yemen and Commander-in-chief of the 7th Army Corps, of which he was relieved in 1898. The new Commander-in-chief is expected at Hodeida from Yembo within the course of the next fortnight.i In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

Consul Monahan to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 36.) Jeddah, September 18, 1911. WITH reference to Acting Consul Dr. Abdur Rahman’s despatch No. 33 of the 24th ultimo, 1 have the honour to submit the following summary of my information as to events in Assyr :— The Grand Shereef, with about 1,500 of his Bedouins, and with twelve battalions of regulars (say, 5,000 men) and about fourteen light guns, six of them apparently Hotchkiss guns, the regulars being under the command of Brigadier-General Nesha’at Pasha, of the General Staff of Constantinople, left Gaus (about six hours from Cronfudah) on the 19th June, and entered the besieged Abha, chief town of Assyr, on the 16th July. The siege, which had lasted about nine months, was thus raised, and desperately-needed provisions were brought in for the garrison. A few days, however, before the relief of Abha, four blockhouses in strong positions close together in the immediate neighbourhood of Abha, all four held by one weak battalion with two guns, surrendered to the Idrisee insurgents for want of provisions, and are still in the hands of the insurgents. One of the guns has been since recovered. The men apparently remain prisoners. On the way from Gaus to Abha there were no serious encounters, but the insurgents, who were without artillery, on several occasions fled before the artillery fire. 1 he losses on the side of the Government in killed and wounded were very small, but among the regulars, who suffered greatly from the heat, the losses from disease were very heavy, Nesha’at Pasha admitting that 800 regulars died of disease, seemingly cholera or dysentery. The Grand Shereef returned from Abha to Taif without any regular troops or guns. There are now sixteen battalions with twenty-six guns, six of them heavy guns, in Abha. The member of Parliament for Abha, Seyyid Ali, who having been shut up in the besieged town has not been able to attend Parliament, has now gone to Taif. He is an ignorant Arab of the Bedouin type. Brigadier-General Mohammed Ali, A ali of the Yemen, is now in Geezan with 2,000 men, and Colonel Hamdi Bey with six battalions (say, 2,500 men) in Loheiya. They are waiting for cooler weather to advance against Sabiyeah, Idrisee’s head quarters, near which place Idrisee himself is now on Mount Haifa. Nesha’at Pasha has returned to Constantinople. The Grand Shereef since his triumphant return to the Hedjaz has become exceedingly independent, and is likely to give much trouble to the Government, The Shereefian prison for Bedouins in Mecca, which, since the advent of freedom, has been in a doubtful position, is now a firmly-established institution, and the Grand Shereef | is asserting his power of life and death over the Bedouins. At the reception held on his arrival at Taif he violently and publicly abused some Shereefs of the Daui Zeid, [ between whom and his own rival line of the Abadilah there is an immemorial feud ; [2215 9 — 1 ] [40523] (No. 687.) Sir,2 and he has had a serious quarrel, only just now patched up, with the vali, Hazim Bey, a weak and insignificant person, because the latter remonstrated with him for this unseemly conduct. He has caused four carriages, brought by speculators into Mecca for the conveyance of pilgrims, to be burnt, on the ostensible ground that immorality#^ was being practised in them, but really because such carriages had never hitherto been ridden in by anyone in Mecca except the Grand Shereef and the vali.

The terms of the arrangement are as follows : that there shall be a truce for four years; that the Imam shall restore all prisoners taken during the recent fighting, and that the Imam “ shall enjov comp ete liberty in the region which he commands,” i.e., Saade. The “ Turquie ” adds that Shenf Mahmoud, the Sheikh of Saba, who was one of the Imam’s partisans, has made his submission to Izzet Pasha, and that the latter has appointed him Kaimakam of Saba with the usual salary. .^ ie furquie adds that Izzet Pasha has initiated the scheme of reforms, which is being prepared by a special commission at the Porte, by establishment at Hodeidah of a school, admission to winch is to be restricted to the sons of sheikhs held by the *oy eminent as hostages for their fathers’ good behaviour—a measure which, if it seem somewhat out ol place in a constitutional country, the French journal applauds as likely to conduce to the tranquillity of the province.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. L Vice-Consul Richardson to Mr. Marlina. (No. 38.) y TIodeidah, July 22, 1911. WHILE the lemen highlands have been fairly quiet recently and the country restored to its normal condition, the state of the province of Assyr, where insurrection still life, and that of the lehema in general continues to cause anxiety locally. The Zereneek tribesmen, who have given no particular trouble to the Turks since the expedition dispatched against them in the early part of 1909, are once more on the war-path. Besides constantly holding up camel caravans traversing their district, they have cut the telegraph line between Beit-el-Fakih and Zebeed. Telegraphic communication between this and the outer world has thus been in a state of interruption durin 0, the past six weeks. The author itics ha^ e no available force at present to deal with these troublesome and tiuculent tribesmen, who are naturally taking advantage of their preoccupations elsewhere. c The tribes in the northern part of the Yemen Tehema are in a state of foment, and are continually attacking supply convoys and small detachments of troops moving in their district. On the 11th instant a large body of Arabs from the Abs clan, inhabiting the country lying to the north-west of Loheia and professing allegiance to Seyyid Mahomed- el-Idrisee, with supporters from the Beni Islam and Beni Merwan tribes, arrived just outside Loheia, and about one and a half hours’ march from the town, and seized the wells supplying its inhabitants with drinking water. It is estimated that their numbers exceeded 5,000, and that their approach was facilitated by the Beni Jama tribe and several of the Wayidat clans. The cutting off of the water supply completely immediately caused the greater part of the population to quit the port and take refuge in the islands of Camaran and Farsan respectively. The garrison of Loheia, consisting of one battalion of regulars and a battalion and a half of redifs, did not consider itself strong enough to meet the invaders. On the 12th instant the commander of the Hodeidah division, Colonel Hamdi Bey, who was at Camaran on inspection duty, received the news that Loheia was hard pressed by the rebels, who had cut off the water supply of that place. He immediately proceeded to the latter town, taking with him a battalion of infantry (Regiment 115, Battalion 1) that happened to be at Camaran, with two Maxims and four guns. Quite suddenly, while Hamdi Bey was making preparations to advance against the rebels, a dispute arose between the Idrisee’s followers, who were under the leadership of a certain Shereef Monsoor and Mahomed-ibn-Zaid, and the Beni Jama tribesmen over some trifling question. Fighting ensued, resulting in slight loss on both sides, but which caused the invading contingent to retire from the wells after their leader was wounded. The Sheikh of the Beni Jama tribe that inhabits the villages outside Loheia and in vicinity to the wells, then tendered its submission to Colonel Hamdi Bey, and [2151 ee—4]2 invited him to occupy the wells. This the latter did, with two companies of infantry and one gun. . ... A u karagol ” or hlockhouse has since been established at the wells, and a permanent garrison with one gun posted there. A Mantel (8 7 centim.) gun has also been mounted in fort at Loheia, so as to command the villages outside. A Colonel Hamdi Bey returned here on the 19th instant, and was given a great ovation on landing. It was reported here, on the 15th instant, that the combined Turkish and Shereefian troops under Hussein Pasha, the Grand Shereef of Mecca, that had advanced from Goz, near Cumfuda, on the 18th June, had defeated the rebels investing Abha under Seyyid Mustapha, the Idrisee’s lieutenant, and had relieved the besieged town on or about the 27th of last month. The above intelligence, although published officially, is received here with some reserve, and needs confirmation. It is even stated by the local authorities that the Shereef is now diverting hi s attention to Sabyeah, the stronghold of Seyyid Mahomed Idrisee, where the latter is supposed to be at present. Other forces from Zaidyia and Geezan will move simultaneously to co-operate with the Shereef’s army, with the object of completely encircling the pretender and cutting off his escape to the mountains. Mahomed Ali Pasha is still at Geezan making preparations for a forward movement, which, however, will not take place before October. Large stocks of provisions, ammunition, stores, &amp;c., and a quantity of condensed water are being collected. ■ He has some 1,500 or 2,000 newly arrived regulars at his disposal, the remnants of his defeated and demoralised force having been sent away. It is expected that further big reinforcements will shortly arrive from Constantinople to deal with the rebellion under Seyyid Idrisee. It would appear that about a half of those that have been landed here since the beginning of the year have died from the effects of the recent campaign, as also from the ravages of cholera and other diseases in this province.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copies of reports from the Intelligence Department regarding recent events in the Yemen and Asir. It is impossible to guarantee the accuracy of this news, which is obtained from Arab sources, but it may be of assistance in appreciating the situation. Copy of this despatch is being sent to Constantinople. I have, &amp;c. MILNE CHEETHAM. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Extract from a letter dated Hodeida, July G, 1911, respecting Affairs in the Yemen. (Secret.) THE tribes attacked a force of 500 Turkish soldiers whilst on the march from Sanaa to Loheiya, but the Sheikh of El Zaalia assisted the latter and convoyed them through. About 120 of the rebels were arrested and sent in chains to Hodeida for punishment. The Sheikh El Zaalia came in to be rewarded. The army of the Shereef of Mecca entered El Goza, where it was attacked by 2,000 of El Idrisi’s followers, but repulsed them, killing 200 of the rebels and taking many prisoners, who were removed to Taif. The Shereef devastated the country , and is now at Mahagil. Some of Idrisi’s followers and of the independent tribesmen surrendered to the Turkish Government. Mahmud Bey El Nadim. who is attempting to act as mediator on behalf of the Turkish Government, has presented El Imam Yehia with a decoration, and a rumour (probably groundless) is current that he wishes to make peace with the Government. The Syrian road is cut off by the Garaih and Zaratik Arabs, who have plundered a caravan and cut the telegraph wires. Loheiya is reported to be very strongly held, and to be proof against the assaults of the investing Arabs. The Shereef of Mecca and the vali are marching to its relief. i / Later. —It is reported that the son of the Shereef of Mecca (who commanded his army) has been killed. If true, this would appear to mean that the army marching to the relief of Loheiya has suffered a reverse. His death would probably greatly encourage the rebels. Intelligence Department, War Office, Cairo, July 30, 1911. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. News regarding the Yemen and Asir obtained indirectly from one of the followers of Shereef “ Noumayf son of the Shereef of Mecca, who has recently arrived secretly in Cairo. (Secret.) THE Shereef of Mecca sent thirty-six of his family (Ashraf) to collect taxes from the people of Kaid Ibn Khershan. On arrival they found that El Idrisi had already collected the taxes, and in the ensuing dispute they and their followers were all killed. The occurrence is thought by the Arabs to be very grave, and an indication that feeling even among the hitherto neutral tribes is growing very strong against the [2151 o —4]Shereef, as it was not long since the murder of such a number of “ Ashraf ” would have been impossible. The rumour that the Shereef Abdulla, son of the Shereef of Mecca, has been killed in battle is repeated, but not confirmed. For some time the country round Sanaa has been absolutely peaceful, and the vali (Mohammed Ali Pasha) withdrew his troops from the fertile district on which they had been quartered and gradually pushed towards Loheiya, and thence towards Gezan. While en route he was opposed by El Idrisi s forces, who held an important watering place in such strength that he has been unable to carry it, and matters are now at an impasse. The vali is said to have telegraphed via Sanaa to Constantinople for five or six | “ tawabir ” (about 50,000 men), without which he cannot carry on ! He is said to be on the point of reopening negotiations with El Idrisi, who will not accept anything less than his former terms. El Imam Yehia has deemed the moment ripe for opening the question of arbitration by a non-interested European Power. Their previous experience of such, when the Italian Government, through Signor Salvatore Paggi, succeeded in obtaining the release and repatriation of sixty-five Yemen notables who had been confined in Rhodes, was very happy; but they do not wish to employ Italy again, neither will they consider Germany, but would be glad of England’s good offices. In re turn they would offer the mediating Power (it is as well to notice that they presuppose that the award would place them in a position sufficiently independent to do so) as a reward, either of two alternatives :— (d.) A concession of the mineral rights, which they claim are very valuable. (b.) A monopoly of trade, always excepting spirituous liquors, tobacco, and drugs, which would be absolutely prohibited.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 510 of the 20th July last, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Hodeidah, reporting on a serious reverse suffered by the Turkish expedition against Seyyid Mahomed-el-Idrisee in Assyr. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Richardson to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 34/e.) Sir, Hodeidah, June 23, 1911. I HAVE the honour to confirm my cablegrams Nos. 18 aud 19 respectively, reporting a surprise of a Turkish force by Arabs near Geezan, and now beg to furnish the following further details :— As will be seen from my three preceding despatches, a force to be commanded personally by the vali of the province, Mahomed Ali Pasha, was concentrating at Geezan for operations against Seyyid Mahomed-el-Idrisee in the Aboo Arish district, and thereafter for advance in the direction of Abha. The above force up to the date of the surprise, viz., the 13th June, consisted of four battalions and one company of regular infantry, with a total strength of 3,000, one battery of gunners, with six mountain guns and two Maxims. Several hundred mules and a considerable quantity of ammunition, provisions, stores, and warlike material had also been collected at Geezan. The troops had been landed at the latter port between the 30th May and 11th June, and were under Colonel Raghib Bey, who was specially selected by the vali as second in command of the expedition, and had recently arrived from Sana’a. Mahomed Ali Pasha, who had arrived in Hodeidah on the 3rd instant, was still here awaiting further reinforcements for his army. On the morning of the 13th four battalions with four guns and two Maxims advanced from Geezan and encamped at a place called Hafayir, three miles outside that town. The town of Geezan is supplied with water from wells situated at the latter place, which was held by 400 or 500 Arabs. Since the mobilization of the troops at Geezan, neither the latter nor the towns people had been molested while going out to the wells to fetch water. When the force advanced it drove off’ the Arabs from the wells by artillery fire and encamped in the vicinity. A little before midday the same day a force of about 10,000 or 12,000 Arabs that had been concealed behind a rising ground some 10 or 12 miles from Hafayir advanced quietly, and was unobserved till when within a few hundred yards of the iurkish camp, which they surprised and immediately rushed. It would appear that the lurks had neglected to send out scouts or to establish outposts. The sudden appearance of the Arabs in force caused a panic amongst the troops, and caused them to rush about in confusion, the Arabs in the meantime attacking and coming in hand to hand combat, and using their daggers freely, The Turkish troops were too tired, foot-sore, and suffering from the effects of the sun and want of water at the time to offer much resistance, and were completely overpowered. Finding themselves overwhelmed by the Arab hordes, they fied in disorder to Geezan pursued by the enemy. The gun-boats “ Peki Shevket ” and ‘‘ Entebbe ” then in port, seeing what had [2101 h/i — 2 ]'i 2 occurred, opened fire both on the town of Geezan, which the rebels had now entered, and on the camp at Hafayir, where fighting at close quarters was going on. The bombardment continued for four or five hours punishing both Tnrks and Arabs alike, but especially the latter, who were in considerable numbers, and who were ultimately forced to retire. The losses on the Turkish side are estimated at between 1,000 and 1,600 killed, but ' nearer the latter figure, 400 wounded and many men missing. The authorities admit that 1,000 men were killed and 400 wounded in the Arab attack. The rebels also suffered severely, chiefly from the bombardment, and left about 1,000 dead on the field. Colonel Raghib Bey, who was in command at the time, has since been reported to be missing, and believed by some to have committed suicide and by others to have escaped to Massawa. The gun-boat “ Malata ” brought the news of the disaster on the evening of the 14th. Under orders from General Izzet Pasha, Mahomed Ali Pasha, who is blamed for the incident owing to his dilatoriness, immediately embarked the same night on the above-mentioned warship in company of one, Sherif Ahmed El-Muharish, a notable of Sabyeah, and sailed early the next morning for Loheia. On the 17th instant, the Ottoman ship “Sabah” arrived here from Geezan with 400 wounded aboard, with whom she sailed again on the 21st canalwards. It is believed that these men will be taken to Beirout for treatment. Yesterday the Ottoman transport “ Bahri Jadid” came here, also from Geezan, transporting 620 sick and wounded, who have since been landed at Djabana for treatment. It will thus be seen that out of Mahomed Ali Pasha’s force of some 3,000 men there have been between 1,400 and 2,000 casualties, while another 600 have become ineffective through disease, leaving between 400 and 600 men at his disposal. These, besides being quite demoralised, are suffering from the heat and from want of water. . The veils outside Geezan are actually in the hands of the Arabs, but who, beinor within the range of the guns of the Turkish gun-boats in port, can be kept at bay. ° It is now expected that the expedition from Geezan must necessarily be abandoned un ess big reinforcements can be spared from Sana’a. The severe and trying climate o the Aboo Ansh country and the scarcity of water, with rumours of the prevalence of cholera in that locality, are factors militating against the success of an expedition at the present time. r At the same time, the authorities fear a similar attack on Loheia and the cutting oil of the water supply of that town, that is served by wells 7 or 8 miles distant. All available troops will be required for the defence of Loheia, where there are only two ^ a J? 118 a P re jsen Two battalions have already left Sana’a for Loheia and Zaidyia respectively and Izzet Pasha has informed the local authorities that two other battalions are now on their way to Yemen from the Hedjaz. arrivprf 11 wt ^^t, part of the first battalion of the 115th regiment that recently to inwl * r/ t0 , part in the expedition from Geeln, and since found transnorted in rU 0 '' t 1 ^0 gunners and a lew Maxim gun companies, were above mentioned WM' 0 ' ! | n ' | r;ui, to undergo quarantine.

Since the last week of April there have been no military operations in the vilayet of Yemen proper, from which time, it might be said, that the revolt in the YemeiO, highlands, under the Zeidi Imam, collapsed almost as suddenly as it commenced. Things in this province have since assumed, more or less, their normal aspect. The generalissimo of the forces, Izzet Pasha, who has some twenty battalions at his disposal in Sana’a, has been very busy receiving various sheikhs and the heads of Arab clans in the mountains, who come in daily to announce their submission. These sheikhs are being received with great ceremony and are dismissed with lavish presents and sums of money. It is estimated that since the end of April over 8O,000L have been distributed in Sana’a alone in purchasing the submission of the tribesmen. It is also freely rumoured that Izzet Pasha is in correspondence with the imam, Seyyid Yahya, with a view to securing some permanent arrangement with him and also to inducing him to liberate all Turkish prisoners. It will thus be seen that operations are at an end in Yemen proper, at least for the present, and that the authorities have succeeded in re-establishing the status quo in this vilayet. They apparently do not intend to go further, although a few weeks ago there was some talk about an expedition to Shahara, the imam’s stronghold in the mountains. The results of the recent insurrection in the Yemen may be summed up as follows : It has cost Turkey some 8 or 4 millions of money to bring an army of 30,000 men to this country with a proportionate number of guns and a considerable quantity of stores and ammunition and to maintain that force in the field during the operations of the past four months. She has only succeeded in inflicting slight punishment on the imam’s levies and in expelling them from her old positions in the mountains, which she has now again occupied. I his result, however, has not been brought about without incurring serious loss of life, due principally to the ravages of cholera and other diseases. On the other hand, the imam, Seyyid Yahya, who has put the Ottoman Govern ment to very great expense, and has severely taxed its military strength, has himself been 'v ery little hit by the operations, and has incurred but small expense in doing so. He can, moreover, boast of having taken a thousand prisoners and added to his arsenal some six or eight guns and a considerable quantity of small arms and ammunition. ^ ie mean time, affairs in the sanjak of Assyr, which now also comprises the fehema, north ol Geezan, have been going apace. . I he garrison at Abha under Suleiman Pasha, the mutessarif, consisting of four or five battalions of infantry and two batteries of artillerv, and having a total strength of 8,000, has been besieged since November 1910. Although it has been able to keep the lebels at bay, rebel does not appear to be forthcoming. ,, ^P r ^’ ^ ie m °kile force of 1,500 men and four guns that accompanied m mm b ieree f from Mecca reached Lith, only to find that the two battalions moved lr om Yemen to reinforce it, were cholera infected. puimg the past month it is said that nine or ten battalions have arrived at Lmmmda from Constantinople to reinforce the shereef’s army. i,, 'f . a ^ (r &gt; ho '^r, from all accounts, has not been able to make much headway, a . ! loa&amp; 1 it was teceri y stated by the authorities that the sheikhs and tribesmen in the Sh^reer^banner 11 1 ^ ^ eil( ^ eie ^ their submission, and were flocking to the Grand . b” 8 ‘' tell yT e S co ' tradicted by Liter reports received here to the effect that the b n y ' a f Sl ! ffei !

The Arabs in the Aboo Arish district and inhabiting the littoral north ot* “^xeezan, who profess allegiance to Seyyid Mahomed Idrisee, are now displaying great activity. borne time ago they captured three dhows laden with stores and provisions destined for the troops in Assyr, and made two officers and seven men accompanying those v'essels prisoners and removed them to Sabyeah. Failing to recover the dhow r s referred to above, four Ottoman gun-boats bombarded the ports of Birk, asm, and Shukeik causing some damage. After several months of inattention to affairs in the province of Assyr, partly due i to preoccupations caused by the revolt in ^ emen proper, the Ottoman Government has at last decided to dispatch an expedition on a large scale to relieve Abha on the one hand and to crush the growing influence in that region of the Pretender, Seyyid Mahomed El-Idrisee, on the other. I he Shereef of Mecca’s army, it is reported, has already been reinforced by nine or ten battalions of infantry drawn from Aleppo and other places and a battery of quick- firing guns, and will advance on Abha from Cumfuda. On the k 29th ultimo General Nashat Pasha, who recently arrived from Constanti nople for service in the Yemen, left here for Cumfuda to command a brigade under the Grand Shereef. As news from Assyr is very scarce here, it is not known what progress the j expedition has made so far, although the local authorities report that it has advanced. On the 3rd instant General Mahomed Ali Pasha, vali of the Yemen and commander of the local army corps, arrived here from Sana’a en route to Geezan. His Excellency, it would appear, will shortly march with eleven battalions and six guns from Geezan against the Idrisee’s stronghold at Sabyeah and thereafter operate in the direction of Abha with the object of effecting a junction with the shereefs army. As reported to-day in my despatch No. 31, three transports, with four battalions of infantry, six mountain guns, and four maxims, a considerable number of transport animals, and a big quantity of ammunition, stores, provisions, and expeditionary equipment have already left here for Geezan, the base of Mahomed Ali’s operations. On the 7th instant the first battalion of the 115th Regiment, 995 strong, and the 2nd battalion of the 84th Regiment, consisting of 350 men, arrived here from Sana’a. Yesterday cholera was declared to have broken out amongst the men of the former battalion that is under orders for Geezan, there being about seventy attacks and thirty- four deaths from the disease in twenty-four hours, The latter-mentioned battalion will remain in Hodeidah to do garrison duty, vice the 1st battalion of the 118th Regiment already moved to Geezan. Mahomed Ali Pasha is still in Hodeidah awaiting the arrival of other troops from Sana’a. He will be accompanied during his operations by a certain Shereef Ahmed El- Maharish, of Sabyeah, whose hands, it will be remembered, Seyyid Mahomed Idrisee caused to be cut off last year.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 24 of the 10th instant, I have the honour to report that, though news somewhat frequently reaches Jeddah from Coonfudah (Assyr), there is no confirmation here of the story which has appeared in English newspapers of the fall of Abha, chief town of Assyr, and the surrender of its large Turkish garrison. It appears that a small Turkish outpost, not far from Abha, was captured about the middle of May. There always have been some Turkish troops scattered outside and near Abha on the mountain slope (see my despatch No. 6 of the 9th Februay, 1911). 1 may mention that Abdullah Bey, son of the Grand Shereef, who, as*I have had the honour to report, has taken part in the recent engagement near Coonfudah, is the Member of Parliament for Mecca. It is reported that he had a horse shot under him in the previous unsuccessful engagement near Gans, five or six hours inland from Coonfudah (see my despatch No. 23 of the 30th ultimo), at which engagement he was also present. The Grand Shereef went out from Coonfudah on or about the 13th instant with all his Bedouins and most of the Turkish regulars that were in Coonfudah. It seems that his Bedouin force melted away a good deal during his march from Mecca to Coonfudah. He does not seem to have ever had more than 2,000 armed Bedouins with him in Coonfudah. I hear that the whole force now remaining in Coonfudah consists of one or two battalions of regulars. The Ottoman steam-ship “ Salonik ” arrived here on the 16th instant with 630 invalided soldiers from Coonfudah, took water here, and sailed for Constantinople with those soldiers on the 19th instant.

A TELEGRAM was received about the 15th June by the ex-Sherif of Mecca, who is living here, from the Secretary of the Committee of Union and Progress, asking him to persuade Mohammed Bey Elwi to go to Constantinople in connection with affairs in the Yemen and Asir, and intimating that if he came all expenses would be paid by the Turkish Government. The latter left for Constantinople on the 21st instant. Elwi Bey, who comes of an old family which traces its descent on the father’s side from the great Saladin and on the mother’s side from a daughter of the Prophet, was for many years a dragoman of the Italian agency. On resigning this post some three years ago he was given the title of honorary dragoman, which enables the Italian agency to still make use of him on special occasions. Owing to his descent, Mohammed Bey Elwi is not only personally well known to the Imam, Mohammed El Edris, and the Senussi, but keeps up a regular and intimate correspondence with all three. This invitation coinciding in dates with the recent news of a serious reverse to Turkish arms near Gezan, indicates that the Ottoman authorities are desirous of consulting Elwi Bey as to the best means of arriving at a settlement of affairs in the Yemen and Asir without a further dispatch of troops, and possibly utilising him as a go-between to arrange terms. The latter role Elwi Bey is prepared to fill on condition that whatever terms are agreed upon shall be guaranteed by a European Power. His inclinations are known to lean towards Great Britain being that Power. In this connection the following information is also of interest: the Ottoman representatives of the Yemen in the Turkish Parliament reached Egypt also about the middle of June, and are staying now in Alexandria. On the 17th June they dispatched a telegram to Cairo to Sheikh Belai El Yemeni couched in the following terms: “ We have come here specially to inform you of the recognition of His Majesty the Sultan of your good services, and to ask you to return with us to Constantinople, in accordance with His Imperial Majesty’s orders for questions connected with El Y emeu. We are awaiting your reply in Hotel Istambul.” Sheikh Belal has gone down to Alexandria to see the representatives, but is rather frightened to accept the invitation extended to him. Sheikh Belal Ibn Obeid Yehia El Yemeni is a native of Hodeidah, and was head sheikh of the Morghania Tarika in the Yemen. He came to Egj pt seyeial j eais ago and acquired a reputation as a spiritual healer of diseases. He has since mained a daughter of rich parents and has given up his spiritual doctoring.

According to the official report, the losses on the side of the Government were seven killed (four regulars) and fifteen wounded, and seventy of the insurgents were found killed. Gaus and some of the neighbouring little villages were burnt by the troops. A small red flag of the Idrisee insurgents, with the usual “La illaha illallaha” on it, has been brought here in triumph hy the Ottoman gunboat “ Giuktche Dagh,” arriving from Confudah on the 5th instant, which also brought eighty-five of the Grand Shereef’s Bedouins, two of them wounded and the rest rejected as unfit for service. It is said here that eight battalions of regulars are coming from Hodeidah to Geezan (Assyr coast) to march presumably on Idrisee’s head-quarters, Sabiyeh. The Grand Shereef remains in Confudah with, it is now said, ten battalions of regulars and his Bedouins. The Ottoman steam-ship “ Koniah ” arrived here on the 9th instant from Constantinople with the 32nd Nishanji battalion for Confudah. She remains here for the present, disabled by some defect which will probably oblige her to return to Suez for repairs, and has landed here that battalion which will proceed to Confudah by the first opportunity.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Ottoman gun-boat “ Tash Kupri ” arrived here on the 2iith instant from Coonfudah, bringing the news that there had been, about ten days before, an encounter between two battalions of regulars with two or three guns and a force of loyal irregular tribesmen under the Grand Shereef’s son on the one side and insurgent Assyr tribesmen on the other side, at a place about six hours inland from Coonfudah, in which encounter the Turkish troops and loyal Bedouins were worsted and had to retire to Coonfudah, losing of the regulars 54 soldiers and 4 officers killed, the losses among the irregulars being unknown. The reverse is attributed to deficiency of water and ammunition. The Grand Shereef was proposing to sally forth on the 27th instant in person from Coonfudah with a large force of Turkish regulars and Bedouin irregulars, but it is not yet known whether he lias done so. In Coonfudah there appear to be about twelve battalions of regulars and about sixteen light guns. , Tr . „ . , , u n During the above-reported encounter the u Pash Kupri aimed a tew shells at a village near Cooufudah, but appears to have done little or no damage. I have just now heard a seemingly unfounded report of an important bombardment by iurkish gun-boats of a place near Geezan on the Assyr or Yemen coast to the south ot Coonfudah. it being said that the British flag hoisted over a building occupied by the agent of a British trader was not respected by the bombarding gun-boats.

A\ IIH reference to my telegram No. 144 of yesterday’s date, I have the honour to report that for some days past the local press has been publishing reports of what appeared to be a serious reverse of the Turkish troops in the Yemen. The Govern ment, however, have persistently denied these reports, but from telegraphic information just received from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Hodeidah it would appear that they were by no means devoid of foundation. Dr. Richardson learns that about a week ago a Turkish force was surprised by the rebels outside Yeezan; a panic ensued among the Turkish troops, of whom 1,000 were killed and 400 wounded, the small proportion of the latter being accounted for by the fact that the Arabs used daggers. Four mountain guns and two Maxims were also captured, and the Turkish commander is reported missing. Four whole battalions were practically driven into the sea. Dr. Richardson does not mention how many Turkish troops were engaged. The town of Yeezan has been since destroyed by bombardment from a Turkish gun-boat, but the rebels remain in command of the water supply. The vali, who left Hodeidah on the 14th June, is apparently preparing to start with a force of eleven battalions from Loheija against the rebels, and another expedition, composed of ten battalions, left Comfnda last week, under the command of the Shereef of Mecca, for Yeezan.

THE attached note on the campaign in the Yemen has been compiled in this office from such official reports as are available, supplemented by accounts obtained from local sources.

F. STACK, Major, Director of Intelligence, Egyptian Army. Intelligence Department, War Office, Cairo, May 15, 1911. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Campaign in the Yemen. EARLY in January the decision was taken to send an expeditionary force to quell the rebellion which had broken out in the Yemen. By that time the garrisons in the interior were practically confined to their stations, and communication between Hodeidah and Sanaa had been interrupted. The total force on the spot was, approximately, 20,000, the garrisons of any | importance being— Hajul (west of Amran). Moka. Taiz.Composition of Force. The expeditionary force under orders was composed of 34 battalions (*24 regular and 10 reserve), 6 mountain batteries, 3 machine gun companies 1 company oi^ engineers, and 2 sanitary companies : a total of about 22,500 of a ran s. ' It was placed under the command of Fenk Izzet Pasha, Chief of the General Staff, who is said to be a capable, level-headed man and one of the best of the Turkish generals. He served previously in the Yemen as chief of the stall to Ahmed Feizi Pasha, spent some years in Germany, and is very highly thought of. His chief of the staff is Miralai Auni Bey, who commanded the bamsun Relif Brigade in the Albanian operations last year. ' The force was divided into three divisions, respectively under the commands of— Lewa Ibrahim Pasha (General Officer Commanding^ 4th Division at Dedeagatch). Miralai Hamdi Bey (formerly commandant, Bulgarian frontier). Miralai Biza Bey (who previously saw a good deal of service in the Yemen). The difficulty of providing transports, and the large number of redifs electing to pay the £ T. 50 exemption money for service outside Europe owing to reluctance to serve in the Yemen, caused a certain amount of delay in moving the reinforcements. The first contingent did not sail till the 21st January, and it was not till the end of March that the bulk of the force arrived. Four Turkish gun-boats, intended for patrolling purposes in the Bed Sea in connection with gun-running, were also dispatched. The Imam’s numbers. The Imam was said at the outset to have 50,000 men in the field, but it is probable these numbers are exaggerated. At the same time, when it is remembered that most of the Turkish garrisons were besieged simultaneously, the over-estimation cannot be very great. Plan of Campaign. The plan of campaign appears to have been to move a column, as soon as sufficient troops had landed, to the relief of Menakha, which is strategically the key to Sanaa, and, whilst awaiting further reinforcements, to strengthen the position there and secure the line of communication with Hodeidah. To land another column at Moka for the purpose of relieving the garrisons at Ibb, Yerim, Dhamar, and Doaran, and clearing the country to the south. On the arrival of Izzet Pasha with the main army, to make a general advance on Sanaa. In this advance it seems to have been the idea that the southern column should co-operate. Gabbana, some two hours to the north of Hodeidah, was utilised (owing to cholera having broken out among the garrison at the latter place) as the port of disembarkation for the main column destined to the relief of Sanaa. First Stage of the Advance. Towards the middle of February sufficient troops had arrived to enable Biza Bey v ith a flying column of six battalions and other details to commence his advance to Menakha, which is about 100 miles from Hodeidah, and thus half-way to Sanaa. C)n arrival at Huggeila, where the hilly country (Jebel) begins, Biza Bey’s column, I mam 8 adherents were strongly posted on the heights along the Wadi Hajjan, turned northwards, made a detour through the hills in order to avoid t e mam road which runs along the dry bed of the stream, and rejoined it some miles iiirt icr on at Wisil, from whence the route to Menakha was open. The latter, after a siege ol over a month, was reached on the 24th February. The enemy, evidently discovering too late that their flank had been turned by this manoeuvre, which was made possible by the friendly co-operation of Abdulla Beshir, bheikh ol Sa lan, withdrew in the direction of Sanaa. Menakha, perched at an altitude of 6,000 feet on a narrow ridge joining two (is me moun am ranges, is yell situated for defence against an enemy not in possession ol modern guns.

I t l Vi maUei n garriS o nS ™ theroad between Menakha and Sanaa, such as, Mahfak, Suk-el-Khamis, Bauan, and Sinan Pasha, and had drawn their investment round banaa more closely. I be latter town, which is well fortified and was reported to have had a garrison of 1 squadron cavalry, 4 battalions infantry, ond 3 batteries artillery, with plenty of lood-stuns and ammunition, had been invested more or less since the 12th January but ow ing to its superiority in guns was not subjected to a general assault, and had been a rile in consequence to make some effective sorties. Infoimation is sparce as to the amount of opposition met with by the main army but so far as can be judged by the slowness of its progress its advance must have been’ disputed, the most serious engagement being at Matnah (or Sinan Pasha), about 0 nines from Sanaa, on the 3rd April, where evidently the insurgents made their last e cits to frustrate the attempt to relieve Sanaa. Here a heavy defeat was inflicted on the enemy, who drew off to the north-west. In the fighting between Menakha and Sanaa the enemy s casualties are reported to have been 1,500, whilst the Turks lost a third of that number. On the relief of Sanaa, a column was dispatched to clear the country to the north and north-west and to raise the investment of Amran and El-Hajja. This object was effected, but, to again judge by the time taken, determined opposition must have been met with. The Southern Column. . regarding the southern column is scant}'. On landing at Moka, leaving Taiz on its right, it appears to have marched straight to Ibb, which it relieved, and thence to lerim, Dhamar, and Doaran. At Dhamar and Seraglieh, further north, it seems to ha\ e met with and successfully overcome a good deal of opposition. It was not till two days after the relief of Sanaa that this column was reported to be within one day’s march of that place. 1 elegraphic communication was restored with Hodeidah on the 11th April, but the censorship is evidently strict, as very little news has transpired except that officially communicated to the Constantinople press. The Situation. Although there is no doubt the Turkish troops have been uniformly successful and the^ garrisons invested have been relieved throughout the district, the best informed native opinion from the Yemen inclines to the view that the revolt is far from crushed. I hey say that the tribesmen will withdraw to the inaccessible mountainous country to the north and north-west of Sanaa, wherein is situated the Imam’s head-quarters, and w here the whole countryside is entirely devoted to him. The Imam’s strongly fortified capital stands on the summit of Jebel Shehara (some 8,000 feet high). It is said that there is only one possible road of approach, and that this is practically impregnable. From here he and his tribesmen will defy the Turkish forces and await a favourable opportunity to again strike a blow for their independence, or, at any rate, some form of autonomy, which is the least that they will be satisfied with.If this appreciation of the situation is correct, and previous history also endorses it it would seem that the Ottoman Government will have to permanently maintain a very large garrison in the country until such time as Hodeidah is connected to Sanaa by railway, and communications in general are improved. At present only that sectwu of the line as far as Huggeila has been definitely decided on, no decision iaA mg as been come to as regards its continuation to Sanaa. It is estimated that this first section (of which Izzet Pasha cut the first sod on the 2nd March) will take eighteen months to complete.

GERARD LOWTHER. remarks on tlie probable course of the intended operations in Assvr:— The first object of the operations in that province must lie the relief of Abha, where the garrison has been besieged for some six months. Between Abha and the sea lies Sabyeah, the Pretender’s stronghold, which threatens the flank of any force advancing direct on Abha either from the north or Abha, while battalions are landed at various points on the coast to protect their flanks. I he northern force is that of the Shereef of Mekka, and consists of Arab tribesmen, of whose numbers there is no reliable indication, supported by two or three Nizam battalions of the Hejaz Division and some guns. For the protection of his march as far as Confuda, the Fekke redif battalion, embarked at Mersina on the §th April, has been disembarked at Lit about the IGth April, and three battalions (1/79 from Beyrout, and 11/78 and the Missis redif battalion from Mersina) were disembarked at Confuda about the 17th April. fhe southern force is probably that of Said Pasha, who, as mentioned in my previous report, was sent from Hodeidah, via Zeidiyeh, to operate in the district of Hujjeh. lie probably had with him the battalions which arrived in Hodeidah too late to take part in the relief of Sana’a, and is said to have had eight or nine battalions altogether. It appears that the pacification of Hujjeh, with the co-operation of the columns from Sana’a, has already been accomplished, and that Said Pasha is now marching north. For the protection of his left flank the redif battalions of Sis and Yarpuz were landed at Loheia early in April. The redif battalions of Marash and Bazarjik, which passed Port Said on the 1st May, should also have arrived some days ago. Their destinations are said to be one for Confuda and one for Loheia. Above we have eight of the twelve battalions previously reported by me to the War Office as forming a reserve division for the Yemen expeditionary force. The other four are, the Minister of War tells me, all of the old IV Ordu, and are at the present moment at Aleppo, but that they are on the point of being dispatched. A few days ago a battery of six guns was also sent from Aleppo to be shipped at Beyrout for this expedition. south.

Hodeidah, April 12, 1911. 1 HAVE the honour to confirm my cablegram of the 8th instant, informing your Excellency of the relief of Sana’a on the 4th by a force under Colonel Riza Bey. It would^ appear that the above force encountered no resistance whatever in entering Sana a itself, the Arabs, who were apparently in some strength in the heights to the south, having hastily retreated northwards with the approach of the main army. On the 2nd instant, General Izzet Pasha telegraphed to the Hodeidah authorities reporting severe fighting a few days previously between the troops under Riza Bey and the insurgents near Nebi Shaib, a mountain fastness (the highest in the Yemen) commanding the village of Metneh and the Turkish fortified outpost of Senam Pasha from the west, and about 22 miles to the south-west of Sana’a. According to the local authorities, the rebels, who were under three of the Imam’s principal leaders, were severely defeated, and had over 1,000 killed including all three commanders. I am of opinion that the Arab losses have been greatly exaggerated by the Turks, who publish no casualties amongst the troops. Riza’s force met with further opposition on the 3rd instant at the village of Musajid, 10 miles to the south of Sana’a, but easily succeeded, by the free use of its artillery, in dislodging the insurgents from their positions, and putting them to flight. The two reverses mentioned above evidently caused the remainder of the rebel bands near Sana’a to evacuate their positions and retire to the west, thus enabling the relieving force to enter the capital without opposition, and which it did on the afternoon of the 4th. General Izzet Pasha with the main army, comprising some fifteen infantry battalions with several guns, arrived at Sana’a on the following afternoon. The relief of the capital was celebrated with general rejoicings, and a grand review of all the troops in garrison was held by Izzet Pasha on the morning of the 6th. The following details of what took place at Sana’a have been furnished to me by one who was present there and went through the seige. The first manifestation of the present revolt under Seyyid Yahya was the appear ance of armed bands in the vicinity of the capital, on or about the 12th January last, that prevented the post from Hodeidah reaching its destination, and forced it to retire on Metneh or Senam Pasha. Coincidently with this coup, the rebels invested the town of Sana’a from all sides in great strength, and cut off all communications with Menekha and Taiz to the south, as also with the garrisoned towns in the north. The besieged garrison consisted of four infantry battalions, seven batteries of artillery of all kinds'] and two squadrons of cavalry. The native battalion recruited in the Yemen last summer proved to be useless. As soon as the trouble commenced, two-thirds of the battalion deserted and joined the Imam, after a futile attempt to blow up their barracks. The military authorities immediately caused the remainder of the corps to be confined in the principal fortress as a precautionary measure. Only a few [2028 y —3] cy-9 non-commissioned officers, old residents of Sanaa, and avIio had thcii families there, remained loyal to the Government, and were alloved to he at large. ^ The vali, Mahomed Ali Pasha, proclaimed a state of siege at Sana a on the 12th January, ordered that the gates of the city he closed, and prohibited all exit fiom it. At the same time he caused to he arrested and confined in a foitiess se\eial prominent^ Arahs, including some m the employ of the Government, on suspicion of having been in correspondence with the Imam Seyyid Y ahya. On the 13th January the vali, with a force of about 1,000 men and four guns, made a sortie outside the Hodeidah gate, that is, to the west of the town, and engaged the rebels in a severe fight, in which, it is said, that they (the rebels) lost over 500 men, including four important sheikhs. This estimate, however, needs confirma tion, and is apparently the official one issued at the time. The Arabs, I infer, suffered principally through the Turkish artillery fire, and attempted to rush the guns, but failed badly. The losses on the Turkish side were trifling. This, I believe, was the only occasion in which there was any serious fighting between the besieged garrison and the insurgents throughout the siege. The rebels concentrated in the direction of the town of Raudah and the village of Shaoob, lying to the north of Sana’a, but confined their activity from the start to sniping at the walls of the town, especially at night. The garrison used to reply by rifle fire, but sometimes used to amuse themselves by keeping up a desultory bombard ment of the villages round about and any portions of the enemy that came in sight. Very little damage used to be done, although quite a quantity of ammunition was expended. On the 30th January, according to my informant, two small outposts at a place called Assir, situated on the crest of the mountain ridge overlooking the town of Sana’a from the west, were attacked and captured by the Arabs, the small garrisons occupying these being forced to surrender after their stock of ammunition was exhausted. Two guns and a Maxim, it is stated, fell into the hands of the rebels, who afterwards removed these south to bombard the Turkish fortified post of Senam Pasha. Later, on the 12th February, a detachment of 250 Arab troops (?), probably Syrian, evacuated a position in the neighbourhood of Metneh owing to lack of supplies, and in endeavouring to reach Sana’a w T ere obliged to surrender to the Arabs near the village of Mind, just outside Metneh, after their ammunition had run out. On the 20th March the Turks occupied a ridge to the east of Sana’a, called the “ Donkey’s Back,” and shelled the village of Shaoob to the north all day. On the 20th March General Mahomed Ali Pasha, with a force of about 1,000 men and five guns, made a sortie to the south-west of the capital, destroyed the village of Safiya, and bombarded another called El-Hadda that was affording hospitality to the insurgents. About mid-day he was obliged to retire rather suddenly owing to the advance of a strong body of the enemy on his right flank. On the ^ffih March the lurks again occupied the ridge to the east called the Donkey s Back, and kept up a fire with their artillery on the houses and tow T ers of the village of Shaoob, that were apparently strongly held. The infantry advanced towards the village at noon, but made very little progress. Later in the day another battalion made a sortie from the northern gate of the town in the direction of Shaoob, and came m close quarters with the rebels. The troops retired at sundown, bringing in the heads of foui Arabs, which the authorities caused to be hung up at the four principal gates of the city. ^ ^ In addition to the various sorties referred to above, on the 3rd April, being the day previous to that of the entry of the relief force into Sana’a, Mahomed Ali Pasha, with two battalions and five guns, tried to occupy the villages of Safiya and Assir, but was obliged to retire owing to the greater strength of the enemy. Ibis may have only been intended as a reconnaissance by the Pasha, and, if so, certainly served its purpose, as on the following day, i.e., the 4th April, heavy firing behind the Assir ridge on the Hodeidah road was audible in the forenoon, and later to the north, m which direction the Arabs were hastily retreating. About mid-day the rebels abandoned the Assir ridge, commanding Sana’a from the south-west, and the relief force under Colonel Riza Bey entered the town a few hours later without opposition. gar s osses sustained by the garrison during the siege, I learn from a fair reliable source that the total number of wounded admitted into hospital since the sie^ amoun ec o oi y- iree. the number of men killed during the various sorties ma( did not exceed fifty or sixty, and the total casualties 200. M y mformant critlci ses the arrangements made by the Turks for the defence3 the town of Sanaa, where, with a force considerably below 6,000 all told, they tried to defend a perimeter of 12 k.lom. In his opinion, it was, indeed, possible for the Arabs to have taken the place by assault at any time if they were able to use their guns The rifle shooting of the troops was very poor, and their artillery practice worse. am a ' ile . t0 . con him the above opinion from my experience up at Sana’a. The Turks burst their time-shrapnel about 1,000 feet in the air, where it was quite harmless to perhaps anything but an aeroplane. The common shell used had very little effect on the houses and towers round about Sana’a. It would appear that in a single day Mahomed Ah s force tired off at least 3,000 shells in the bombardment of Shabob, and on other occasions but little less, disposing of barely 200 or 300 Arabs. The enemy, on the other hand, had not the vaguest idea of making war, nor had they any particular plan of campaign. Without the slightest pretence to cohesion, the Arabs do not pay the least attention to the orders of the Imam or to those of their leaders. Each man fights independently as le thinks lit, his chief object being to avoid risking his “ skin ” any more than he can possibly help. What appeared to have scared the Arab rebels most were dynamite cartridges with a friction fuse attached, which the Turks laid down at intervals all round the walls of the town. A shepherd one day trod on one of these, which immediately exploded and Mew hnn up making the enemy very cautious about approaching the walls thereafter. hroughout the siege there appears to have been no particular scarcity of supplies, the authonties having taken the timely precaution of laying in a plentiful stock of grains and other foodstuffs during the past year when the crops were abundant.

GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Richardson to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 20/e.) Sir, Hodeidah, March 27, 1911. SINCE the relief of Menekha by the force under Colonel Riza Bey, quite a month ago, there has been very little to report concerning the operations of the expeditionary army against the rebels in the highlands of this province. Although 20,000 infantry reinforcements and three or four batteries of mountain artillery have been landed here and dispatched to the front since the beginning of last month, the advance Sanaa-wards has been very slow. In the meantime, the situation in the province of Assyr, from accounts received, has grown worse gradually, whilst the insurrection in the districts of El Hajjeh and El Hajjur, in the mountainous 'country to the north-west of the capital and along the south-eastern frontier of the vilayet, has been making rapid strides. On the 9th instant General Izzet Pasha, accompanied by General Seyyid Pasha and a big stall* of officers recently arrived from Constantinople, left for the front, to personally conduct the operations against the insurgents in the direction of Sanaa. Izzet Pasha reached Menekha on the 15th, but not without incident, his party (that included the mayor of this town, Seyyid Ahmed Pasha-el-Sherai) being fired on by Arab tribesmen when about 10 or 12 miles outside Hodeidah. Three of the culprits implicated in the above-mentioned outrage, that was apparently not directed against the generalissimo, but intended to be against Seyyid Sherai Pasha, have been arrested and brought here for trial. Concurrently with Izzet Pasha’s arrival at Menekha, the force under Colonel Riza Bey, about 5,000 or 6,000 strong, moved to the north—Sanaa-wards and, after encountering some opposition from the rebels en route, established itself on the 18th instant at a position called Ijz—that is, six hours’ march northwards from Menekha. Between the 18th and 24th Colonel Riza Bey was only able to advance another 10 or 12 miles farther, to Suk-el-Khamis, and that not without meeting with stout resistance and severe fighting, the insurgents challenging every mile of his advance. Suk-el-Khamis is a military outpost to the north-west of Menekha, and baiely 15 miles from it as the crow flies, and is situated on the summit of a range of mountains in the El Heima district. The garrison in the above town had been reported on the 1 5th instant to t le Ka'imakam of Menekha as being on its last legs and likely to surrender, as its stoc o supplies had run out. No details of the fighting that occurred during the march to Suk-el-Khamis are available here, the authorities exhibiting great reticence in the matter . General Izzet Pasha has since advanced with another force to Suk-el-Khamis and joined hands with Riza Bey, but it would appear that he has been obliged to le urn o Menekha to divert his attention to the course of events elsewhere. . Rumour also credits Colonel Riza Bey as having left Suk-el-Khamis for Sonam Pasha— that is, 15 miles farther north and about the same distance from Sanaa but [1972 oa—1] 1 ^ i /% CJI^ ^ .

The Hodeidah authorities, on the other hand, cannot spare troops to send to his assistance. . We have practically no news whatever here of the progress ol the rebellion in the south-eastern frontier of the vilayet, although the intelligence received some time ago that most of the garrisoned towns had fallen to the onslaught of the rebels under Seyyid Abdulla Ibrahim, the Imam’s principal lieutenant, daily gains credence. About a fortnight ago the Kaimakam of Cunfuda reported to the Mutessarif of Hodeidah that the° rebels in Assyr under Seyyid Mustapha had captured a Turkish position in the vicinity of, and to the south of, Abba, where severe fighting had taken place in which both sides lost heavily. It is feared that Abba itself will succumb unless relieved very soon, but there appears to be no immediate intention to dispatch reinforcements thither or to undertake the offensive against the insurgents there professing allegiance to the Pretender, Seyyid Mahomed-el-Idrisee. Rumours are current here that the Grand Shereef of Mecca will shortly leave with a strong force of tribal levies from the Hedjaz to co-operate with the Turks in suppressing the rebellion in the sanjak of Assyr and in crushing the influence of the Idrisee Pretender. Ottoman gun-boats have shown great activity during the past month in patrolling the Yemen littoral, with the view to suppressing the arms traffic. About three weeks ago information by telegraph was received by the local authorities from the Minister of War at Constantinople to the effect that a German steamer called the “ Louise ” [?] had sailed from Europe with a consignment of arms and dynamite apparently bound for Bussorah, but possibly destined for the Yemen rebels. The gun-boats “ Rafahiya,” “ Bafra,” “ New Shehr,” “ Ordu,” “ Yozgot,” and the torpedo-destroyer “ Pek Shevket” have since been distributed over the eastern littoral of the Red Sea between the Straits of the Bab-el-Mandeb and Ounfuda, and are cruising about on the look-out for the above-mentioned steamer.

(No. !6 E.) ^ r &gt; Hodeidah, March 6, 1911. 1 HAVE the honour to confirm my telegram of the 26th February to your Excellency, reporting the relief of Menakha two days previously by a Turkish force under Colonel Riza Bey. A Greek merchant who has been established at Menakha for many years has now reached Hodeidah from the latter place, and has furnished me with the following details. It would appear from the above man’s information that the town was under siege by Seyyid Yahya’s levies for about one month. The garrison consisted of the 14th Nishanjee Battalion (old organisation), the 3rd Battalion of the 119th Regiment— temporarily detached at Hodeidah from Sana’a last December, but locked up in Menakha while trying to return to the cnpital—some 500 recruits that had arrived in December from Constantinople, destined for Sana’a, and a detachment of garrison artillery. There were abundant supplies and ammunition to hold out for several months, and even fresh provisions were by no means scarce. The rebels were kept at bay principally through the neutrality observed by the tribesmen inhabiting the mountains which surround Menakha, viz., Beni SaTan, Metwah, Beni Ismail, and Masar, and who, at the same time, afforded them no hospitality. The Arabs in the three former places are chiefly of the Shafai and Dawoodia sects, and those of Masar principally Zeidi. On the other hand, the powerful Beni Mukattil tribe occupying the mountain range to the south-east of Menakha, in their own interests, operated against the Zeidi rebels, with a view to dislodging them from their mountain homes. The above-mentioned tribe is of the Dawoodia (a sub-division of ShiahJ persuasion, is markedly hostile to their Zeidi co-religionists, and can easily muster 1,500 fighting men. They at the same time profess no love for the Turk, but on the present occasion were glad to receive arms and food-stuffs from the Kaimakam of Menakha in return for the services rendered to the besieged garrison. Colonel Riza Bey, who had six battalions with him, after leaving Hujjeila on the 21st February deviated to the west and ascended the Sa'fan mountains with the friendly assistance of Abdulla Bishir, the sheikh of that place. The force then descended at the termination of the Wadi Hajjan and climbed up to Wasil, which is on the lower slopes of the Masar range. Between Wasil and Menakha the road was clear of the insurgents. Colonel Riza Bey entered Menakha on the 24th afternoon with two battalions, posting the other four along the road to keep his communications open with Menakha. It will thus be seen that the Turkish force avoided the M adi Hajjan, wheie the rebels were posted in great strength along the mountains commanding it, and, in doing so, encountered no opposition whatever in its advance on Menakha. In the plains, Seyyid Hussein with 2,000 levies from the Kohra tribe co-operated with the military authorities against the rebels fortified in the Labab heights. fl972 c— 1]O,, lb, 27th iotf Th'is &amp; Reima and clear the mountainous country between Hujjeila and Menakha Seyyid Yahya’s levies now finding it almost impossible to take Menakha have abandoned the idea and have moved Sana awards, and are concentrating their attacks on the outposts lying between the two above-mentioned places, viz., at Ijz, Metak, Suk-el- The garrisons at these places are small, and, although completely isolated during the past ten or twelve weeks, have been able to hold out owing to the rebels not Heliographic communication between Sana’a and Menakha via Suk-el-Khamis, that had been partially maintained up to the end of February, has since been completely out off owim? to the insurgents having transferred the scene of their activities Sana a- 1 am unable to obtain confirmation of the reports received and transmitted to your Excellency, announcing the fall of Anis, Damar, Rida, and Y’erim.

Up to date, Pi battalions of Nizam infantry, 8,500 men strong, have been landed here for suppression of the revolt and operations against Seyyid \ ahya’s levies, and two battalions of 1,200 men in all disembarked at Mokha for service in the Taiz district. I learn incidentally that it is proposed to send two field and seven mountain batteries to the Yemen, of which both field batteries and two of the mountain batteries have already been landed at the Djabana anchorage.

A Kb lt y TT ep0rt 1 ed h f. re tllat 011 or about the 15tl &gt; January last, Suleiman Pasha left Abba With three battalions and several guns, and encountered the rebels outside in g iea t kzrcc under Seyyid Mustapha, the Idrisse’s principal lieutenant in Assyr. lie local authorities give out that Suleiman Pasha at first fired blank charges from ins guns to throw dust in the eyes of the Arabs, who had been informed by the Pretender that the Turkish cannon were harmless, and that their bullets would not penetrate their bodies. At this the insurgents tried to rush the guns and were punished very severely in the attempt, losing several hundreds. It would appear that this worsting disheartened the tribesmen, many of them retiring from the investment of Abha and returning to their homes. The news of the above insurgent defeat, which was received at first with scepticism here, has now been confirmed. No engagement has been reported since, but the garrison at Abha still appears to be under investment, and all communication with the coast continues to be completely cut off J As far as I can ascertain, Seyyid Idrisse has the support of some 25,000 to 30,000 armed men in the country lying between Sabyeah, his head-quarters, and Abha, and between the former and El Hujjur in the west. El Nakeeb Seyyid Mustapha, the Pretender’s right-hand man, is supposed to have between 10,000 to 20,000 men surrounding Abha and between it and the coast. ^ Ihe other rebel leaders are Shereef Nazir-ibn-Haidar-ibn-Ibrahim with 2,000 men, Shereef Monsoor-bin-Mahomed with 2,000, Shereef Mahomed-bin-Ali-ibn-Hussein with [1935 dd—l]2 1,500 riflemen, Shereef Haidar-ibn-Mahomed-el-Muhajjib with 700 rifles, and El Sheikh- ibn-Bakri with 1,800 followers. The above armed bands are distributed over the disturbed area between Northern Yemen and the province of Assyr. . . No news has been received lately of any marked acti\ity on the part of th^ Idrisse’s adherents in the Zaidyia and Beni Keis districts. On or about the 15th instant, the tribesmen inhabiting the tract of country just above Zahra, that is, some 25 miles north-east of Loheia, who are favourable to the Idrisse’s cause, captured a Turkish convoy with eighty camel loads of provisions and stores destined for the garrisons at El Hujjur. The Kaimakam of Loheia set out with 200 troops^ to endeavour to re-capture the convoy, but was compelled to beat a hasty retreat after having about 50 casualties in a brush with the tribesmen. The general opinion prevalent locally is that the Arabs in the Sabyeah district are suspicious of the intentions of Seyyid Mahomed Idrisse, and are, moreover, discontented with the treatment received at his hands. It is freely rumoured that the Pretender has demanded for his own use from the tribesmen a third of the tithes due to the Ottoman Government instead of payment of any part of those dues to the latter. It might be that Seyyid Mahomed and his followers, who are aware of the pouring in of Turkish reinforcements into Hodeidah and of the operations now being taken against the Imam Seyyid Yahya, are only playing a waiting game. General Seyyid Pasha is still here, and has no immediate intention of proceeding to Assyr. The local authorities expect that Suleiman Pasha will be retained in command at Abha owing to the success he has met with in his engagements with the insurgents. General Seyyid Pasha, who, it will be recalled, reported favourably last year on the intentions of Seyyid Mahomed-el-Idrisse in the Sabyeah district, is now obliged to admit that he was hopelessly misled by Khoja Tewfik and others, referred to in my despatch of the 29th November, 1909. He however informed me that nothing has been lost by the postponement of the proposed operations against the Pretender till the present juncture, as this has given the ignorant tribesmen time to recognise the hopelessness of their cause, and also to discern the impostures practised by their leader. Itwould appear that Seyyid Mahomed-el-Idrisse has quitted his head-quarters at Sabyeah since the beginning of this year and has moved further north tp Djebel Farfar, where he has fortified himself against a sudden surprise from the Turks.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Richardson to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 10.) ^ # Ilodeidah, February 16, 1911. EY ER since my despatch of the 13th January was submitted to Mr. Marling, the situation in this province has gradually been getting worse. I have from time to time reported to your Excellency, by telegraph, on the general progress of the revolt in the Yemen under the Imam Seyyid Yahya; but I have abstained from furnishing details in the form of a despatch owing to the contradictory and conflicting nature of the information that has reached Hodeidah, in spite of anything that may have been published at length in the various European and Turkish papers abroad. Hodeidah has been more or less completely cut off from Sana’a and Menakha respectively on the western, and from the Turkish outposts on the south-eastern border ; so much so that intelligence of what is actually going on is scanty here and most unreliable. I may mention that the authorities at Hodeidah are not very much better served in this respect than we are, and it often happens that the information contained in reports submitted by them to the Central Government is premature. Sana’a, as I have already reported, has been completely invested by the rebels since about the 12th January. The garrison is much smaller than I at first supposed it to be, having been markedly decreased since my visit to the capital last summer. There cannot be more than four battalions of infantry at the outside, and seven batteries of field and mountain artillery. A very good stock of food-stuffs, military stores, and ammunition was laid by the authorities last summer, and I think that the garrison can hold out for fully ten or twelve months as far as provisions are concerned. A few days after the town of Sana’a was invested, the rebels appeared in great strength at its very walls, but were driven off by General Mahomed Ali Pasha, who, 'with two battalions of infantry and two batteries of artillery marched outside and stormed the town of Rauda, some 3 miles to the north, where the rebels had fortified themselves. According to some accounts the Turks suffered a slight reverse from the insurgents a little distance to the west of Sana’a, at a mountainous place called Assir. The latter slopes command the entrance into Sana’a from the western side, and according to information received at the time and since confirmed, have fallen into the hands of the Arabs. It would appear that the vali, General Mahomed Ali Pasha, fearing intrigues amongst the local Arab residents of Sana’a, who are naturally inclined towards the imam, and are in correspondence with him, imprisoned the principal merchants in the fortress and caused all the gates of the walled city to be closed. This resulted in the cutting off of fresh supplies from outside and soon compelled the vali to change his tactics. He opened the gates of the town after having first bombarded and destroyed the numerous petty villages in the environs that gave shelter to the rebels investing the capital. [1935 u—2]Heliographic communicatioii with Hodeidah was at first mamtame , t tins was interrupted by the Arabs seizing Nabi Sheib, commanding the outpost at Senam Pasha at one point, and bv sniping the Turkish heliograph station at Menakha at another During the past three weeks no news has been received from the capital, and the. local authorities betray great concern regarding its pending tate. The military garrisons at Senam Pasha, Buan, Suk-el-Khaims and Mefaq , lying between Sana’a and Menakha, have also been besieged by the insurgents, and contradictory intelligence has been received as regards their late. . , J . Sevvid Abdulla Ibrahim, the imam’s principal lieutenant, is very active indeed in south-eastern Yemen and the towns of Muabar, Walaan, Rida, and Yenm, where the TravVe nWvs maintained small garrisons have fallen to the onslaught of his armed bands. , • i i n , It would appear that the civil officials and the garrisons ^ there have surrendered without resistance, and have been permitted to retire to Sana a , ^ whereas the officials and troops who have attempted to oppose the rebels have been seized and sent to the Seyyid Yahya’s stronghold at Shahara. The town of Ibb, I am informed, is actively besieged by the rebels who propose to divert their attention to Taiz later. The village of Hujjeria, which has always been hostile to Turkish administration, has declared in favour of the imam and has killed its kaimakam. The imam’s adherents who in former rebellions did not think of attacking positions as far south as Menakha, the real key to Sana’a and to the position in the Yemen in general are profiting by their experience in the past, and have lost no time in besieging Menakha, whose inhabitants are secretly decidedly hostile to the Turks. Reports of several small brushes with the rebels in the mountains south of Menakha have been received between the 1st and JOth February, in which the lurks have been generally worsted and forced to abandon their untenable outposts and retire to Menakha. The rebels have, moreover, appeared in the heights giving access to Menakha, and are in possession of positions lying between the latter place and the Tehama. Their object is to cut off and stoutly oppose the Turkish advance on Sana’a via the Wadi Hujjeilla and Menakha. The tribes of Beni Mukatil and Beni Mura inhabiting the Hujjeilla district and belonging to the Dawoodia sect although not professing allegiance to the Turks, are at the same time no lovers of the imam or of his Zeidi followers. Severe fighting has been reported between the tribesmen and the rebels whom the former are trying to dislodge from their district. It might be as well to mention that in the present rebellion, from what one can judge here, the imam has not succeeded in obtaining the co-operation and support of all the tribesmen inhabiting the agricultural districts lying between Hujjeilla and Sana’a. The latter are fairly tired of internal strife, and are too busy attending to their fields that have received plentiful rains during the past year. Seyyid Yahya has therefore been obliged to have recourse to the predatory and warlike tribesmen hailing from the mountains to the north and north-west of Sana’a, viz., the Hashed- Bekeel, Dho-Mahomed, and Dho-Hussani, with whom he has overrun the country. \ arious tribesmen, on the other hand, have been reluctantly compelled to take sides with the Pretender, owing to their having previously rendered up hostages as a guarantee for tendering him support in his cause against the Turks. Hie attitude of the Beni Matar tribe in the present revolt is not quite clear, as they have had differences with Seyyid Yahya after the upheaval of 1905, chiefly owing to the assassination of their Sheikh Ramah whilst a guest of the iman at Sana’a. Ihe other route to Sana’a via the Sanfur Wadi, generally utilized for the passage of camels transporting Government stores and private merchandise, has also fallen into the hands of the insurgents and has caused the evacuation of the Turkish outposts at Bab Kohlan, Beit-el-Kabili, and Beit-el-Nejd respectively along that wadi-bed, rendered untenable owing to the hostility of the surrounding country, and the smallness ot the garrisons stationed there. On the 1st instant the kaimakam of Bajal, who is at Obal organising a force from amongst the Kohra tribesmen, caused the Sheikh of Hujjeilla to arrest a certain key via AJi Ismail, who was on his way to the imam’s head-quarters with two huge cases containing a considerable quantity of Martini caps. This man, who is under confinement here declares that he purchased the caps from the Imperial arsenal at Constantinople, from which place he had just arrived. About the same time Sheikh Mohamed Nasir of Mavia, a not unfamiliar nameat Ills Britannic Majesty s Embassy in connection with the Aden boundary question, arrested two of the imam s emissaries, El Kadi Ahmed, El Mujjahid, and Seyvid Saleh, residents ot Sana a, on their way to Aden, and handed them over to the authorities ^4 Taiz. On the 14th instant a messenger managed to smuggle down to Obal, through the rebel lines, a lettei from the acting kaimakam of Monakha, to the effect that the town was hard pressed ^ and could only hold out for about a week longer, and requesting the dispatch of reinforcements to his relief. k^yy l( l Hussani of Obal has collected a force of nearly 1,500 levies from the Ivohra tribes to assist the lurks in establishing communication with Menakha, and for operations against the rebels at Lahab to the east of Hujjeilla. \esterday the three battalions of Nizam infantry, l,2n0 strong, disembarked off the ships Keneh and Cambridge, were dispatched to Obal, and to-day two other battalions, 1,470 strong, that were landed last night from the transport “Mecca,” will march in the same direction. Colonel Kiza Bey, \vho was stationed in the Yemen for many years, and has served in several expeditions in this province against the Arabs, arrived by the steam-ship “ Mecca from Constantinople, and will command the troops advancing on Menakha. Colonel Riza Bey, who is still here, leaves for the front to-morrow. The cholera that was reported to have broken out in an epidemic form amongst the Turkish recruits stationed at Ilodeidah has now almost disappeared, after claiming some 200 or 300 victims. I have, &amp;c. G. A. RICHARDSON.3 lift [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government l DESPITE the preoccupations arising out of the present Cabinet crisis and the general internal situation in the capital, the gravity of the Yemen revolt is causing official and other circles to consider seriously schemes for some solution of a problem which threatens to become, under the new regime as under the old, a permanent drain of men and money. The Sabah, which has connections with the present Government, recently published an article inviting the new Minister of the Interior to study the problem and suggesting that Yemen and Assir should be governed through the local chiefs, i.e., the imam in the Yemen highlands and Seyyid Idris in Assir. It says the present campaign is the most difficult the Ottoman Government has had to face since the original conquest of the country in the sixteenth century and advocates making a military display, which presumably means the relief of the beleagured garrisons at Ibha, Sana’a, Taiz, &amp;c., and then introducing administrative reforms on the basis of of Turkish rule. It is not impossible, however, that, under such circumstances, the tribes might invite the British from Aden, rather than the Turks, to come in and administer the country. with powers to legislate on matters financial, administrative, judicial and municipal, with the proviso that any decision contrary to the Ottoman constitution or existing treaties may be vetoed by the Council of State at Constantinople. He further proposes that the central Government should grant an annual subvention up to £ T. 100,000 to the Yemen Treasury, while any surplus in the local budget should be remitted to the capital. I beg to enclose a criticism of the project by Jelal Nouri in the “ Jeune Turc.” This and other such schemes are_ distinctly crude, but they j point to the conviction that Yemen cannot be directly administered from Constantinople. The cardinal factor, however, in the \ emen situation is that the imam has historical and other claims to become the independent ruler of the province and that any scheme which does not admit this principle, under the guise, perhaps, of Ottoman suzerainty, is doomed to failure. the honour to enclose herewith, sharply criticises Lutti rikii -Beys proposals mainly on the ground that they fail to suggest a remedy for the imam s sepaiatist claims. As usual he does not favour the broad liberal view of conciliation and working through the imam, but advocates military repression and reducing the Zeuli this time by force to such a state that they will never again be in a condition to start a ovement. This is the policy that was applied to Albania and, if persisted in m the case of Yemen, [1935 /— 61 B [ 8110 ] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. No. i. [March 6.] Section 6. Sir G.

The writer adds that there is less danger in adopting such a course in that the population is divided by the religious antagonism between the Zeidi and Shaft. With the exception of the first proposal of autonomy by Kiamil Pasha in 1908, it is to be feared that most of these schemes are not the outcome of sincerity and that their authors trust that under autonomous conditions rivalries between the Arab sects and tribes, from natural causes or fomented by the Turks, would result in anarchy and an eventual request of the tribesmen for the return Lutfi Fikri Bey, the Opposition deputy for Dersim, has also presented to the Chamber a scheme of part self government for Yemen, by which the Governor-General would administer the province with the assistance of a council of five members, each of whom would be at the head of a department on the Indian model.

G. L Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Extract from the “ Tanin ” of March 1, 1911. (Translation.) YESTERDAY we discussed the Bill for reforming the Yemen, which was hastily drawn up by Lutfi Eikri Bey, deputy for Dersim, in about fifteen days. We return to the subject because the Bill is useful as showing what would probably happen if the administration of the country passed into the hands of those who are always criticising the Government. The honourable member invites us to settle, by some means or other, this problem which has demanded such sacrifices for thirty or forty years, and the remedies he suggests are such as we should expect from a man who begins in that way. Nothing is said, however, about the revolts of Imam Yahya and Seyyid Idris, which constitute the Yemen question of to-day; or rather it is said that it is not thought necessary to settle Imam Yahya s claims by this law. According to the member for Dersim, what the Government has to do is to allow this man’s influence in the Yemen to increase by means of reforms. Imam Yahya has surrounded Sana’a and cut off Hodeidah, and Seyyid Idris has besieged many places in Assir. And the advice given us is to carry out serious reforms and to allow their influence to increase ! Where are we to carry out reforms? What are we to begin on ? No thought has been given to these points. What is the good of this law then ? So long as Imam Yahya’s claim is not settled, how can the Yemen problem be solved ? Since the Government is bound first of all to settle Imam Yahya’s claim and to quell Seyyid Idris’ revolt, what word but “ self- advertisement ” can be applied to this jewel of a production, which was written, like a fairy-story, in fifteen days ? With regard to revolts in parts of the Yemen not inhabited by the Zeidis, one may discuss such causes and economic influences as to the maladministration and tyranny of the old Government: to remove such causes it is of course necessary to establish a form of government suitable to tbe needs of the Yemen. But that is not what we can call the Yemen question : the real Yemen problem for us is constituted by the Zeidis. According to the Zeidis’ religion, the imam of the Zeidis considers himself Khalif, and cannot be in subjection to anyone. He is bound by his religion to proclaim a holy war. While this fact stands, it is a proof of the greatest ignorance to think that the matter can be ended by setting up a sort of chamber of deputies in the Yemen. 1 he Government has not failed to attempt reforms to win the hearts of the popu lation of the Yemen. Has it not abolished some local taxes that annoyed the people ? Have the Sheri laws not begun to be applied to the Yemen? Has not the vali been given wide powers to take measures in accordance with local needs ? Has it not been decided to build railways in the Yemen ? Although these measures are not sufficient, they are a step towards straightening out a njff rs - ^ et Imam Y ahya has revolted, besieged Sana’a and raised other tribes I his means that in order to carry out reforms in the Yemen, or even to apply the a\v &lt; rawn up by the Lutfi Hkri Bey, it is necessary to settle the Imam Yahya question and put an end to Seyyid Idris’ rebellion. What shall we do with Imam Yahya? Repeated events have shown him to be a plague, the harmful effects of which will not je got under until it is destroyed. Will a special sphere, or certain limits be accepted or mam ar\a How can one imagine that there is a possibility of becoming recon ciled with Imam Yahya, whose aim is to gather all the Zeidis, who want Sana’a, under ' S rmnis 10n • lh e member for Dersim’s plan of making Sana’a the chief town o e emen s lows t at he also would be unable to come to an agreement with Imam i a f u ytl t S ° 1 Fikri s Bill is passed into law, there will be military' expeditions to the Yemen from time to time, and the Yemen problem will keep on cropping up, until Imam Yahya is cleared out of the way.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. (No. Sir, 10 .) Major Tyrrell to Sir G. Lowther. Constantinople, February 18, 1911. ON my return from Greece I have the honour to submit the following report, showing, as far as possible, the stage reached in the dispatch of a military force to cope with the situation in the Yemen :— From the first the conduct of the Government has been marked, first, by a reluctance to admit that anything was seriously wrong there, and by the usual attempts to prevent the true state of affairs from being known, and secondly, by the extreme leisureliness of the military preparations. Though the expedition was announced early in January, though various fanciful estimates of the size and composition of the expeditionary force appeared in the press, and though the papers reported the wholesale summoning of redifs, and, on several occasions, the actual dispatches of reinforcements, yet very little was in fact done, and the first troops to be sent were shipped from Constantinople on the 21st January, after which there were practically no shipments till the beginning of February. In the same way the papers have from an early stage been announcing the appointments of various commanders-in-chief, whereas really nothing was settled on this subject till a week ago, when Izzet Pasha, the Chief of the General Staff, was selected to command the expedition. In the meantime there had, however, been a certain movement of nizam troops from the district of the Ilnd Ordu to be shipped at Constantinople and Dedeagach, and arrangements for the formation of batteries and for the calling up of redifs were being made. From the 1st to the 14th February movements were brisker, and roughly half the force is now under way. A fairly plausible reason for the delay was the difficulty of providing transports. It is true that negotiations for chartering three large steamers of the Russian Volunteer Fleet fell through, as the authorities could not come to an agreement with the company about the price. They also made a point of not using an}’ ship of Greek ownership, several of which could have been had. But if the Government had considered the matter urgent, or been really anxious to get troops to the Yemen quickly, such considerations would not have been allowed to interfere with their dispatch. bhe real reasons of the delay were that the expedition is not popular, that the Government was itself divided on the question of its advisability, and that there was a want of money. None of these are admitted. [1894 dd —4]I Service in the Yemen is unpopular, and the country and climate have earned m the past a bad reputation among the people. Further the idea of fighting against h,s co-religionists, especially Arabs, does not appea to the average Anatolian, which may account for the large proportion of the force which is being drawn from Roumeha and Macedonia, which for many reasons, one would have supposed would have been the'' last places to be denuded of their garrisons. Except for this theory that the men of Roumelia with their more modern ideas, have fewer scruples on this subject than those of Anatolia, it is not easy to understand why the Government does not make more use of the large body of Anatolian reserves at its. disposal. 1 heir transport would cost less, and take less time, than that of the European troops, while policy and strategy would also seem to make their employment preferable. I he selection of the find Urdu to supply so many troops in proportion to the rest is certainly rather remarkable, and I hear that Abdullah Pasha, the General Officer Commanding the kind Ordu, has protested against the weakening of the forces on the Bulgarian frontier bv the withdrawal even of these few battalions, and lias sent in his resignation. . , , , . , The summoning of the redifs has met with unusual difficulty, deseitions and endeavours to escape service by payment have been reported, and sometimes the mzams have been hard to move. In at least one case the men w ere onl} persuaded to start by being told that they were going to fight the English. The strengths of the battalions of the expeditionary force are brought up to 550 by drafts and by caUing up the ihtiyats. But the actual number of men under arms in Europe will not be seriously diminished, as the places of men drafted from nizam battalions will soon be taken by ihtiyats and redifs, and complete redif battalions will be called out to replace the nizam battalions which have left. The Minister of War, himself an Arab, is said to have been very much against the expedition, and he was not alone in the views he held. I think the delay was due in some measure to a hope that a compromise might be arrived at, or means found to avoid a punitive expedition altogether without loss of prestige. Though military opinion deplores the necessity of the expedition and blames the policy wffiich has led up to it, yet a similar opinion did not prevent the carrying out of the Albanian expedition last year, and 1 think that the present expedition will now* be carried out • with equal thoroughness and achieve similar results. As regards the composition of the expeditionary force, the usual policy of mystification is being pursued, and such details as I give are all subject to correction when further and more accurate news has been received. The original intention seems to have been for thirty-four battalions, as under, three field batteries, six mountain batteries, three machine-gun companies, one company of engineers, and two sanitary companies:— Battalions. Batteries. Machine-Gun Companies. Nizam. Redif. Field. Mountain. From 1st Ordu 8 „ Ilnd Ordu .. 6 6 *3 6 *3 „ Illrd Ordu .. 3 7 „ IVth Ordu .. 4 •• •• Total 21 13 J 3 6 3 34 • But, as usual, the execution of the plan differs widely from the intention, it is altered from day to day to fit unforeseen circumstances, and its final shape will probably differ considerably from the above. So far nine nizam battalions have been embarked at Constantinople and three at Dedeagach. Three redif battalions from the Illrd Ordu have left Salonica, and I am told that one redif battalion of the same ordu has been dispatched from Mersina, but in the absence of any news from the vice-consul at that place this last is doubtful. Of the nizam battalions, three only have left the 1st Ordu district (and these are, properly speaking, Ilnd Ordu battalions, although under the new organisation they were being transferred to the Constantinople Army Corps), and the nine others are all from the Ilnd Ordu.The redifs called out are :— 37th Regiment (Uskub) 30th „ (Karaman) 31st (Adalia) Total Battalions. 4 ( 0 f which 3 dispatched). 3 ( 0 f which 1 dispatched, probably). 10 cancelled.° rder ° f ^ 47th (Aidin &gt; - -id to have been Nizam battalions still under orders and not yet dispatched are 4 of the 7th Regiment 2 (11/10 and 11/13) .. 3 (11/23, III, TV/34) .. 3 from Erzinjan From the 1st Ordn. „ find Ordu (actually in the Smyrna vilayet). v IUrd Ordu. ,, IVth Ordu.

Three more batteries will be made up with old-patterii guns from Salomca, the personnel for these being supplied from various places ; -80 men of the field artillery have been sent down from Adrianople, probably towards the formation of these batteries. J The engineer company has been provided from the Ilnd Ordu. It was divided into three sections, one of which was sent to Dedeagach, and the other two to Constantinople. So that the composition of the force, judged by the troops that have been so far dispatched (see table annexed) and by those under orders, is as follows Battalions. Mountain Machine-Gun Nizam. Redif.

Major Tyrrell to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 11.) Sir, Constantinople, February 18, 1911. I HAVE the honour to inform you that Ferik Izzet Pasha, who has been appointed to the command of the Yemen expedition, left for Hodeidah to-day accompanied by his staff and other officers. They went in the Armstrong cruiser “ Hamidieh.” It is as unusual for a Turkish man-of-war to be used as a passenger-ship as it is adventurous for her to undertake so long a voyage without foreign assistance, and the fact of this vessel being used for the conveyance of Izzet Pasha and his staff is in itself interesting. The idea is to mark the importance of the occasion as well as to make an impression in the Red Sea and demonstrate the fact that Turkey has now a fleet in being. The “ Hamidieh ” is commanded by Raouf Bey, an English-speaking officer, and one of the best in the Turkish navy. Izzet Pasha had a farewell audience of the Sultan yesterday, and the usual crowd was on board the “ Hamidieh ” to give him a send-off, including the Ministers of War and Marine, both of whom embraced him warmly on parting. Izzet Pasha, who is Chief of the General Staff, is a capable and level-headed man, and one of the best of the Turkish generals, at least so far as education and theoretical knowledge go. He has spent some years in Germany, and was for some time banished to Syria under the old regime. He has already had experience of the Yemen, having served there as chief of the staff to Ahmed Feizi Pasha. He is very highly thought of, and as Chief of the General Staff here had considerable influence in purely military matters, so that his present appointment shows the importance attached by the Government to the successful conclusion of the Yemen affair. Mir Alai Avni Bey, who commanded the Samsun Redif Brigade during the Albanian operations last year, and-who was recently appointed to the command of the new 9th Division at Baba Eski, goes as Izzet’s chief of the staff. Izzet Pasha told me that he intended to operate with three divisions, the commanders of which would probably be Mir Alai Hamdi Bey (formerly Hamdi Pasha, commandant on the Bulgarian frontier), Mir Alai Riza Bey, and Liva Ibrahim Pasha, General Officer Commanding 4th Division at Dedeagach.

When Idris s power beg,ns to wane, or when they see the futility of his pretensmns, they will turn from mm and will join the strongest side. Moreover in Tehama there are Mansabis and Sadats. These will not waver in their service and allegiance to the sovereign State, even under adverse circumstances, and will recoil Rom no self-sacrifice. They show the tribes the right way, they advise the ignorant and reconcile them with the Government. The Mansabis and Sadats are the great barrier to the success of Idris, and the only cause of his failure to extend his sphere of influence. Of the Mansabis, the most prominent, influential, and respectable are those at Mansouneh, Marawa’a, Dar Yahmi, Kutai, Manireh, and Mafki. for four or five months past Idris has been sending his supporters northwards, and has besieged and oppressed Assyr; and in another direction he has sent them to Jizan, Loheia, and Midi, to attack the Wa’idat tribe, who have undertaken to convey military stores to Zohra, Hajur, and Hajje, and other friendly tribes in those regions. But though Idris’s party has fought for some time with the Wa’idat, and has destroyed a great number of them, his main object is to hold the southern districts with a small force, and to extend the rebellion northwards. He is assembling a strong force in the north, and is only reserving the Tuk rebels for attacks in the south. The mutessarif and commandant of Assyr is a firm and energetic man. He is defending Assyr successfully, and will continue to do so. The news from those parts is good. It is said that they can hold out for a year. But this resistance is defensive only and limited, and will not be capable of subduing or expelling the rebels. If a small force could be got through from the landing-places at El Wasm or Shukik, between Ivunfida and Jizan, it would be of the greatest assistance. The partisans of Imam Yahia, under the command of “ The Sword of the Khalifate, [1935/—1] * Not printed.2 Ahmed-bin-Kassim-el-Jenani, who ^ “a relation of one of the deputies marched on Sana'a on the 20th Kianoun Avval, 1326 (2nd January, 1911). On the 9th January Sana’a was besieged. On the 11th January telegraphic communication with Sana a was cut off On that date neither Sana’a nor Hodeidah could communicate with Constanti nople, for the lines connecting Taiz and Hodeidah with the cable were broken. Despite all efforts the repair of them was prevented by the Zeramk rebels. After two or thre^ months the united efforts of the Muhassebeji Zahid Bey, who was acting mutessarif, and Sherai Pasha, succeeded in repairing the line, and communication between Hodeidah and Constantinople was assured. _ , ,, ,, ^ . , The Imam’s rebels after laying siege to Sana a did the same to all the towns in the Jebel. They spread all over the country and pressed on the important places of Amran Kukban, Jihran, Anis, Eidah, and Yerim. They attacked Sinan Pasha, which is the next place after Sana’a on the Hodeidah-Sana’a road, and then Suk-el-Khamis, and then Mafhaka ; and then after occupying the neighbourhood of Menakha, the half-way place between Sana’a and Hodeidah and a position commanding the roads, they came straight down to the border oi Hajjileh. The commandant of Menakha rendered a great service in bombarding Hujra, a stronghold of the rebels. He is still defending Menakha. . pit i i • The kaza of Raimah is also threatened. The kaimakam is one of the loyal sheikhs, and is an energetic and bold man. He is defending the kaza with the help of the tribes and what soldiers there are. Besides this Obal is being hardly pressed ; it is an important place from a military point of view, as it contains a quantity of stores of every kind. Obal is only fifteen or twenty hours from Hodeidah, and if it falls the material loss will be very great. The kaimakam, of Bajil, is pre-eminent for his intelligence and knowledge of local conditions and for his influence with the sheikhs. His name is Elias, and he is one of the notable Sadats; he has joined Seyyid Hussein, a loyal and most experienced and patriotic man, and together they have gone to defend Obal with 3,000 or 4,000 of their tribes. It is confidently expected that they will defend the roads to Obal and Hajjileh until the arrival of the regular troops. The cursed Zeidis are committing great cruelties on the Shafis that fall into their hands. They kill the men, outrage the women, and cut the children to pieces, and practice other barbarities. The rebels have burnt the country of the Beni Naoum, a peaceful and friendly tribe. In those districts the friendly tribe of the Matuh in conjunction with the troops have driven oft* the Zeidis with great loss. The moral force of the Zeidis has been broken before the troops arrive. The necessary help is being sent by the Government to those tribes that are bearing the brunt of the rebels’ attacks. The new mutessarif and the commander of the division are showing extraordinary energy. According to the latest news the number of rebels besieging Sana’a is not great, only about 5,000. The Imam has directed practically the whole of his force to Menakha. His object is to capture that, so as to render the passage of troops exceedingly difficult. There is no cause for anxiety regarding Taiz; the loyal sheikhs there are capable of defending themselves, and the intrigues and threats of the Imam are of no avail. The troops in Yerim in their guardhouse at the top of a hill are making a stubborn defence of the capital of the kaza. On the whole there is no cause for anxiety. Two battalions that have just arrived have been landed at Jebbana, two hours from Hodeidah, on account of the cholera ; but the disease is decreasing, thanks to the energy of the army doctors, who are working day and night to prevent the spread of the disease. It is to be hoped that this time we shall achieve a real success in the Yemen. Mere punishment is not enough. We hope that serious and consistent reforms will be made, that the nation may at last have rest from the worry of the Yemen. But thirty to forty battalions are not enough. Formerly Feizi Pasha with 100 battalions did not succeed in carrying out reforms. We must have sufficient troops.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Gora-nm^t i ''ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [February 27.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 64 of the 25th ultimo, I have the honour to report that, according to a telegram of yesterday’s date which I have received from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Hodeidah, the position in the Yemen is stationary, and but little authentic information can be obtained as to the progress of affairs in that province. The epidemic of cholera which had broken out among the expeditionary troops, who have recently been reinforced by the arrival of 1,200 regulars, is reported to be decreasing. On the other hand, the insurgents are said to have taken the heights which command the access to Menekha (about half-way between Hodeidah and Sana’a), so as to intercept the advance of the Turkish forces on the latter place. A suggestion was made to me by Mr. Vice-Consul Richardson in his telegram that, should I see no objection, an attache from His Majesty’s Residency at Aden might be deputed to follow the Turkish operations against the rebels, but, as such a proposal would raise considerable suspicion, coming from this embassy, and would certainly be rejected by the Porte, 1 do not propose to mention the matter to the Ottoman Government unless and until other Powers express a desire to send officers to the Yemen, and I have accordingly informed Mr. Richardson that his suggestion cannot be entertained. I have the honour to enclose a summary of an article in yesterday’s “ Tanin by Ismail Hakki Bey, the burden of which is that the various risings against the new regime have only served to prove its strength, and a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Hodeidah, received to-day, reporting on the situation up to the 13th ultimo.

Hodeidah, January 13, 1911. ’ SINCE my despatch No. 37/E of the 15th December last was submitted the situation in this vilayet has become worse, and there appears to be every probability for the necessity in the near future of military operations on a large scale against both the Imam Seyyid Yahya, in the mountains, and the pretender Seyyid Mahomed El-Idnsee, m Nbout the 25th December news was received here that the notorious Bom Pasha, at one time the principal sheikh in the Zaidyia district, had escaped from Sanaa and had ioi “d the ta Yahya's standard. It will be recalled that Bom Pasha was responsible for the greater part of the trouble in the Zaidyia and Wayidat districts Jasf winter and was, on the demand of Seyyid Mahomed El-Idnsee, called by the Governor-General to Sana’a, where he has been under detention ever since. In former Zeidi revolts in the ^emen, Boni Pasha, however unscrupulous, has proved of great assistance to the Turks in repelling incursions into the Ei-Mujjiir district by adherents of the Imam, and also in pushing up supplies and facilitating t e movements of troops from Hodeidah in that direction. . , It would now appear that he will be entrusted by Seyyid \ahya, with whose assistance he effected his escape from Sana’a, to harass the Turks m the Hujjiir k a7a . At the same time other bands have appeared in various quarters in the mountains. For instance, Seyyid Abdulla-bin-Ibrahim, one of Seyyid Yahya’s trusty beutenants and bis principal adviser, wbo, it might be remembered, conducted the negotiations at Constantinople in 1909 between the Porte and the Imam with reference to the future administration of this province, has, with a strong following, appeared m the laiz district, where he will head the rebellion. The latter area will be familiar ground to him, as he conducted the operations against the Turks there in the revolt of 1905. ’At Yerim, one Seyyid Aboo Naib is urging the strong Zeidi element to rise m insurrection, whereas Shereef Abdulla Dhumain, formerly an officer in the Ottoman army in the Yemen, has proceeded to the Anis country to take charge of the rebellious movement there. . . , . , f ihp The famous Ali Mikdad, whose name is very familiar m the history or me Turkish military operations in the vilayet of Yemen, has, I learn, already arnve at the outskirts of Djebel Reima and induced the tribesmen to take sides with tae Imam Yahya. . . , i tip The acting kaimakam of the above district has sent an urgent appeal to m Hodeidah authorities for reinforcements, but in the state of affairs existing at presen generally throughout the vilayet they find it impossible to comply with his request.A 3 About a week ago news was received here of an engagement between the Turks and Aiabs in the Summara mountains near ^enm, in which the former had, amongst other casualties, a major and two junior officers killed, and lost a Maxim, which fell into the hands of the insurgents. Further, that assistance arrived from Sana’a and Ahat the Arabs were put to flight. T his information, however, has not as yet been confirmed. The local authorities admit that some fighting recently took place with the rebels near Suk-el-Khamis, but furnish no details of the result. The veteran Nasir Mabkoth, who has on several occasions in previous upheavals in this province defeated the Turkish troops in the kaza of El-Hujjeh, has, I also learn, taken the field there once more and is busy engaged mustering the clans. Telegraphic communication between the Yemen and the outer world has been completely cut off since the beginning of this year. The Hodeidah-Sheik-Said line has been cut by the Zereneek tribesmen near Beit-el-Fakih since November last, and telegrams have been received and dispatched from Hodeidah by the Sana’a-Bab- El-Mandeb line via Ta’iz and Mokha up to about a week ago, when the insurgents interrupted communication between Suk-el-Khamis and Sana’a and between the latter and Ta’iz. Since then telegraphic communication has been hopelessly interrupted throughout the vilayet. The post that left this for Sana’a some eight days ago under a strong convoy has been unable to proceed further than Suk-el-Khamis, owing to the massing of the rebels in great strength between that place and the capital. It is freely rumoured here that Sana’a is actually invested in the Imam’s followers, but the authorities here are remarkably reticent on the subject. As far as I can ascertain, there are about eight battalions of infantry and nine batteries of field and horse artillery and a number of big guns in the capital, which is well provisioned and has an ample stock of munitions of war. The situation in the province of Assyr continues to cause the local authorities grave concern. The capital, Abha, where there is a garrison under the mutessarif, General Suleiman Pasha, is still under siege, and strong Arab bands professing allegiance to the pretender Seyyid Mahomed El-Idrisee are active between the capital and the littoral, as also in the Sabyeah district. The above-mentioned seyyid, who, it may be recalled, came to an understanding last winter with the Ottoman Government through their representative at Cumfuda, General Seyyid Pasha, has now become dissatisfied owing to the non-execution of the reforms in both the sanjak of Assyr that were promised him, as well as in his sphere of influence generally in the northern half of the Tehama in the ^ emen. He (the Seyyid) has become suspicious of the motives of the Ottoman Government with reference to Assyr. General Seyyid Pasha, referred to above, who has now been nominated Commander and Mutessarif of the Assyr sanjak, reached Cimifuda about three weeks ago, but has not been able to get up to Abha owing to the hostility of the tribesmen in the interior. He (Seyyid Pasha) embarked on board of an Ottoman gun-boat at Cumfuda and proceeded to Geezan with a view to interviewing the Seyyid Idrisee at Sabyeah. An intermediarv, a certain Khoja Tewfiq, referred to in my despatch No. 23/E of the 29th November, 1909, was sent to the latter place to arrange a meeting with the pretender, but who, I hear, has declined to receive General Seyyid I asha before the acceptance of certain preposterous demands made by him. Amongst the latter are, I am informed, one for the immediate demolition o the Turkish forts and karagols recently established along the Assyr littoral, and anot er for the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from his (the Idrisee s) sphere of influence, where he undertakes to maintain order and tranquillity with 1,000 Turkis roops which he has asked to be placed at his disposal. . rn . . , , On the 11th instant General Seyyid Pasha arrived here in the lurkish gun-boat “ Yozgat,” with the object of communicating by telegraph with the central authorities at Constantinople. This however, he now finds is hopelessly impossible from H ° d The kaimakam of Aboo Arisch has recently reported to the Hodeidah mutessarifhk about the activity and restlessness of the tribesmen m that locality, and sum ar accoimts have reached the same quarter from the Zaidyia kaza. . • f -.r It is generally expected that thirty-six battalions o regu ar m an ry ' A1 proportionate artillery and cavalry units will shortly arrive from Constantinople to establish tranquillity in this vilayet.I —mfrmm Yesterday Ibrahim Paslia, the newly-appointed Mutessarif of Hodeidah, vice Mahir Bey dismissed, arrived here by the Khedevial mail steamer It is rumoured that the present Governor-General and Commander-m-chief, -y General Mahomed Ali Pasha, will be replaced by a senior and more experienced,, officer.
