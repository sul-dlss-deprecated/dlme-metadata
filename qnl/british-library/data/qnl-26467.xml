Differences had arisen on the following points: a) he wished to see implemented the centralisation in technical matters under the ministry of Defence of all Syrian security services. This view was opposed by the Minister of the Interior; b) he desired considerable expansion in the Syrian ulrray budget; c) he wished to appoint Taha Pasha Hashimi, a former Iraqi General and 1 inister of Defence, as Chief of Staff and also certain of his elderly Syrian ex-Turkish officer friends to high appoint ments in the Syrian Army. 2. The2. The resignation of Nabih el ;*zmeh is to be welcomed since he is a man of extremely narrow National ist outlook with a long history of participation in extreme forms of agitation and a dubious record in Turkey during the last four years of the war. He has considerable influence with the President. Since his return to Syria a year ago and particularly since his appointment to Ministerial rank he has done the Government no good either abroad or withiri the country. He is particularly disliked by the Druses and is known to be opposed to the appointment of foreign (particularly British) experts. 3. f*rdel Arslan, the new Minister of Education, while also one of the original Istiqlal group of the National Bloc, is a man of much wider education and experience and capable of assuming a more enlightened role in the deliberations of the Syrian Cabinet,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT o EASTERN (Syria). CONFIDENTIAL . [E 5213/5/89] A O j July 21, 1939. Section 1. Copy No. 9 7 Consul Davis to Viscount Halifax.—(Received July 21.) (No. 56.) My Lord, Aleppo, July 12, 1939. WITH reference to Damascus despatch No. 46 o f the 3rd July, 1939, I have the honour to report that recent changes in the political status of Syria, beginning with the communique issued by the French High Commissioner on the 2nd July and ending with the resignation of the President of the Syrian Republic and the suspension of the Constitution, have been received with the most complete and extraordinary calm at Aleppo. Not a voice has been raised in protest, not one workman has gone on strike, not a single street demonstration has been organised. Neither the Nationalist bloc nor the Opposition parties have by any sign or token displayed an intention to resist a policy which hut a short time ago would have been regarded as reactionary and totally unacceptable to all patriotic Syrians. 2. For this tame acquiescence three main reasons are responsible. The first is the discredit and virtual disruption which has overtaken the Nationalist bloc here since the end of the strike reported in my despatch No. 37 of the 29th April last. The second is the general feeling of disillusionment, not to say disgust, which has been engendered among the essentially unpolitically-minded population of Aleppo, who, having not without misgiving entered the political arena in 1936 to help the Nationalists into power, found that their only reward was maladmini stration, lack of stability and increasing subordination to Damascus. The third is a better perception of the bitter realities of the international situation, driven home by the object lesson of the loss of the sanjak of Alexandretta to Turkey. This has brought the erstwhile masters of Aleppo within 30 miles of the city gates on the west as they were already on the north, and has given rise to a feeling that the only chance of averting the loss of Aleppo also to Turkey is by encouraging the French to stay in Syria and keeping them in as strong a position as possible. 3. The indefinite postponement of the doubtful boon of independence is also compensated to some extent by the consideration that the increased local independence to be enjoyed in future by the Mohafazat will give an impetus to the natural development of the town and district of Aleppo, which has in the past been too often sacrificed to Damascus. 4. A copy of this despatch is being sent direct to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris and to His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus. I have, &amp;c. A. W. DAVIS.

INDIA OFFICE/ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT July 10 , 1939. Section 1. Copy No. Consul MacKereth to Viscount Halifax.—(Received July 10 .) (No. 46.) My Lord, Damascus, July 3, 1939. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the text of a communique issued yesterday, Sunday, by the French High Commissioner, stating that, for “le maintien de Fordre public ' and in view of the failure of the Syrian Govern ment to take the appropriate action dictated by circumstances, he had decided to increase the local autonomy of the regions of the Jebel Druse and the Alawites, and also to institute French control in the Jezirah. M. Puaux drew the attention of the Syrian Prime Minister to the need of delaying no longer the application of the £C Arrete ” No. 5/LR of the 10 th January, 1936, creating a system of local governments, called mohafazats. 2 . The French authorities, having failed to induce any of the Syrian Governments that have been constituted since the resignation in February last of the Nationalist Cabinet of Jamil Bey Mardam to help them back into the administrative saddle, have been, I believe reluctantly, obliged to take the initia tive themselves. In previous reports I have informed your Lordship that the immediate aim of French policy since the rejection by the Senate Committee of the 1936 treaty appeared to be the creation of a federal system. This is now in the main accomplished by the detachment of important districts, already ethnically and religiously distinct, from the Central Syrian Government. The finer division of the country is foreshadowed by the minatory reminder to the Prime Minister that the system of mohafazats must be brought in at once. 3. In a despatch to your Lordship’s predecessor (No. 13 of the 13th January, 1936( ] )) I dealt in some detail with the implications of the system of mohafazats and, in paragraph 6 , with the Syrian reactions in the matter. It may be recalled that it was the Nationalist opposition to the High Commissioner’s decrees on this subject that started the general strike of 1936, which, in turn, led directly to the French promise of a treaty and to the signing in Paris of the 1936 treaty that was two years later recanted by the French Senate Foreign Affairs Committee 4. The political cycle has made one complete revolution. French policy is back to the point where the Syrian Nationalists challenged it in February 1936. In the meantime, the local political atmosphere has, from the French point of view, improved considerably. The amount of rope that the French authorities allowed the Syrian Nationalists in power between December 1936 and December 1938 sufficed for the Kutleh-al-Wataniyah (Nationalist bloc) to hang itself in the eyes of most Syrians. The bloc has disintegrated into emulous political factions, whilst the bulk of the population has had a surfeit of political intrigue and place-hunting. The French political officers have skil fully played on all the cords. It may therefore be guessed that there will be little or no dangerous internal anti-French reaction. 5. The danger, if there is immediate danger, appears likely to come from Iraq, where disgruntled Syrians, no doubt encouraged by the immunity enjoyed by Palestinian revolutionaries in Syria in the past, are apparently making earnest efforts to stir up a revolt in Syria from a safe distance. It is doubtless to parry such attempts that the High Commissioner has provided for the continuance of French military control in the Jezirah region. I understand that the French are in possession of information to the effect that Adil-al-Azmeh and Fawzi Kawokji are working directly with Sheikh Ajil- al-Yawir, the powerful tribal chief of the Shammar of northern Iraq, to create disorders in the district of Deir-ez-Zor. It has, I gather, been noticed that there has been corresponding activity among the Shammar in Syria. At the same (’) “ Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs,” Part XXXVIII, No. 90. [655 k— 1 ] EASTERN (Syria). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4894/5/89] G l2 time, Mahomet-al-Yassin, chief of the Iraqi desert police, is reported to have been questioning very closely all visitors from Syria who enter Iraq about the number of French troops in Syria and about their dispositions. Coupled with information of this nature are accounts of military training being imparted to Shammar tribesmen by Germans or German agents in Iraq. Altogether, I am inclined to think that the three months that have elapsed since the despatch of my telegrams No. 18 of the 24th March and No. 20 on the 5th April have brought no material change in the situation. In my telegram No. 18 I suggested that Iraqi activity in connexion with Syria seemed likely to cause us some embarrassment, whilst in my telegram No. 20 I saw no likeli hood of serious disturbances breaking out in Syria, provided the Iraqis under the influence of Syrian extremists did not meddle. 6 . I see no reason to disagree with the French opinion that Syria is unripe for immediate independence. From past experience of French skill in handling tiresome and suspicious populations, I should feel little doubt in their ability to deal efficaciously with any political situation within Syria were the inter national situation less obscure. On the other hand, in the event of war the French administrators would be in a stronger position. It may be remembered in this connexion that, hated though the Turks were by the Syrians, and pressed though they were by the British forces, which employed every possible device to stir up revolt in Syria, the Turks had no difficulty in maintaining complete tranquillity in the country throughout the Great War. 7.

En consequence, le Haut-Commissaire a pris des arretes apportant diverses modifications aux statuts du territoire alaouite et du Djebel- Druze pour renforcer leur autonomie, sans toutefois porter atteinte a kunite politique, economique et legislative de Syrie.

Mv lord Aleppo, March 31, 1939. ^ ' WITH reference to my telegram No. 14 of the 28th March, 1939 on the subject of the situation in Aleppo, I have the honour to report that on ^u hda the 23rd March, the Nationalist bloc at Aleppo decided that all shops and ofhees in the town should be closed until further notice as a general protest agamst policy pursued by the French Government in Syria and a special protest again, t the arrest of certain prominent Nationalists in Damascus. NaHnnalkm 2 Owing to the relative loss of prestige and popularity by the Nationalists durino- their two years of office, this decision was by no means generally observed, especially by Christian merchants and shopkeepers. The Nationalists therefoie called up their stalwarts from the Moslem quarters, armed with sticks and daggers and ordered them to force the recalcitrants to close down, using threats or actual violence if necessary. This they proceeded to do under the benevolent eyes of the Syrian police, who in some cases even joined m the good work ot intimidating the obdurate. Until Sunday, the 26th March there was not much actual disturbance, but on that night a bomb exploded about 9-30 P - M - l h® Azizieh quarter of Aleppo, and the following day bands of Moslem youths and children circulated in the streets throwing stones at tramcars. breaking the windows of any shops found open, and obliterating with black paint the French signs on banks, shops and offices. The French delegate and general warimd the Muhafiz of Aleppo that he must keep order or they would intervene. He obiected that he was not accustomed to being spoken to m that tone to which the French replied that he would have to get used to it from now on. 1 hereupon the Muhafiz left for Damascus, handing over his duties to the Syrian chiet ot nolice Nuzhat Bey El Mamlouk. On Tuesday at midday another bomb exploded near the Banque 'de Syrie et du Grand Liban, whereupon the patience of the French was exhausted‘and the delegate called upon the military authorities to restore order in the town. This was done quietly and without incident, but despite the insistence of the French authorities only a few shopkeepers ventured to open up their premises. They point out that as in 1936 the French promiset protection to those that opened and then turned round and made a treaty with the Nationalists, leaving them to the mercy of the bloc's supporters, so m 1939 they have no assurance that the French policy will remain stable. 3 Qn Tuesday, the 28th March, a further bomb exploded at 9-30 p.m. in the Jemilieh quarter of Aleppo, and on Wednesday, the 29th March, another one went off near the French general’s house. Although no particular damage was done a curfew has been imposed in that quarter of the town from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., and the duties of the Syrian chief of police, who has been granted one month’s leave of absence, but remains here for the time being as Acting Muhahz have now been taken over by Colonel Bringuier, the French officer m command ot the Mission for the Reorganisation of the Syrian Gendarmerie. 4 Very few shops and offices in the town have yet reopened, and it is a question whether some shortage of supplies such as bread, meat and vegetables mav not make itself felt shortly if the French cannot succeed m inducing them to change their attitude. In the meantime all kinds of rumours are circulating, including a circumstantial one to the effect that the French have already nego tiated an agreement at Angora to hand over Aleppo together with the sanjak anc the Jezireh°to the Turks in return for Turkish friendship. 5 .

The decision to end the strike was taken by the Nationalist bloc ostensibly to permit the population to make necessary purchases in view of the strained situation in Europe. The real reason was, however, that the Nationalists, con scious that they were fast losing their influence and popularity by attempting to prolong the strike against the wishes of the population, decided to call it off before its gradual and automatic collapse had completely ruined their prestige. 3 . Though the strike has lasted one month and has at times caused some embarrassment to merchants and traders whose business has been more or less seriously interfered with, its general effect has been nil. 4 .

Lutfi Bey Al-Haffar, although subservient to the Nationalist bloc, took the step that the Mardam Cabinet could not, of withdrawing the instructions to Government departments to ignore the High Commissioner’s arretes respecting the religious communities. M. Puaux met this gesture by appointing a commission to discuss the opportuneness and modification of the arretes in question. Following this detente the mandatory authorities maintained their pressure to recover the administrative authority they had hastily relinquished on the signature of the 1936 treaty. Moreover, it became obvious that the High Commissioner was lending a ready ear to the separatists in the Jebel Druse, Jezirah and Lattakia districts, and was unwilling to use French forces to maintain the rapidly dwindling authority of the Syrian Government, child of the Nationalist bloc. The Syrian Nationalists, aware of international rumblings, and encouraged by Iraqian politicians and, it is rumoured, by Turkish agents, decided that the present was a suitable moment for a show-down and resigned. 3.

Opposition is an easy path to popularlty t and as each group of nationalists becomes more amenable, it is replaced by a fresh group of irreconoilables, «ho will no dount in their tern undergo the same process. 6 . The ca» emoratlon of the twelfth anniversary of the battle of Meiaalun on the 24th July furnished clear evidence of the divisions in the nati nalist party. Two years ago, Jamil Mardam gave vent to a violent denunciation of the government of shaykh TaJ-ed-ittn and extolled the Nationalists as the apostles of ocmplete independence. Ifcis year if he had been present at Meisalun he would have heard his own excommunication pronounced by dhukri uwwatll in much the same terms. 7. The ceremony was attended by three processions, the first representing the nationalists including those in office, the second the retired Turkish officers from the Turkish army, (whose secession was reported in my despatch No. 6 C of the 13th July,) and lastly the extreme nati nalists. Beki bey el ihatib delivered a speech which was chiefly the apologia of the official nationalists; he was followed by Shukri Cuvrwatli, who accused them in set terras of treachery to their own party in collaborating with the French without first securing the two primordial demands of the Nationalists - Syrian unity and Syrian sovereignty.

There was a certain amount of scuf ling about the grave, when wreaths were being placed, but the ceremony ended at sunset without any actual exchange of blows. 9. To my mind the intestine differences of politicians present a less disturbing problem than the economic malaise, on which I reported in my despatch Ho .*,6 of the 7th my, par.8-11. Recent events in Aleppo have revealed the existence of a large depressed class, sufficiently organised for offensive action, and of other elements prepared to exploit it. I do not know whether she orgurisers of the demonstrations in Aleppo are frustrated nationalists or co nnsuiiiBts; but I observe at i^amasous a group of young and educated comn.unists in close touch with unemployed or partially employed workmen and agricultural labourers, and corresponding with Uosoow. The vehemence of their social sympathies, I am told, would not survive appointiuent to a post under iovsrnraent, but as almost the entire output of the University cherishes the same ambition, it is improbable that all the oonfmnist organisation can be thus eliminated, and the danger will continue to exist. 1C. The lovern* ©nt is fully conversant with the economic situation and has called a number of conferences with the Chambers of Commerce and Agriculture and indeed invited the evidence of any interested person. Aleppo sent its own deputation with a fairly exhaustive list of desiderata com prising she repeal of the Decree against public agitation(ray despatch Ho.18 of 19th February, 487/7/1), ameaty for students, dissolution of nominated municipal and administrut Its councils, Waqf committeaa, and chambers of agriculture, and their replacement by free ©lection, the reform of waqf administration, judicial services and public instruction, th© grant of facilities for legal proceedings against public officials, the examination of the tithe question and re mission of debts in respect of past years, tho settlement of the water uestlon by cancelling the existing concession, protection of native industries, workmen's insurance and the cure of unemployment, and the dissolution of the present Chamber as unrepresentative. 11. The heads of the deputation, g&amp;adnllah Jabri, Jamil bey Ibrahim pasha and dubhi bey Hayal are violent (and unemployed) nationalists and had evidently drawn up this list of reforms, all beyond the competence of the Syrian (Sovornment, as a sample of what they would do if they were in power. Their passage through Homs provoked some slight ebullition but there was no incident at Jamascua, beyond the customary ovations of the youth. 18. The 'Jovernrent hastened its deliberations and took a number of decisions, which were communicated to the press on the 3rd August, a summary is appendeu, but it is evident that their effect cannot be very far-reaching, as any broad measures of reform are entirely in the domain of the High Commission. 13. For the moment agricultural depression has been to some extent relieved by tithe reductions on a large scale, and an emergency decree, just signed, is intended to reduce unemployment among weavers by doubling the duty on silk and artificial silk fabrics, but the affect of the latter will be long/long retarded by the large etooka on the i?urket. Ttoa Qxt&amp;iom- houae has been too long employed as primarily a device for the prodoetion of fnnd 8 t and the ec moraio aitnation cannot be expected to respond immediately to such late treatment; moreover the remedy proposed is only partial. 14.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 35 of the 7th May, on political events in Syria, and with particular reference to paragraph 5, I have the honour to report that the first session of the new Parliament took place yesterday. 2. The Deputies were summoned by a decree dated the 2nd June, to meet in extraordinary session on the 7th June, and the agenda laid down exactly: Firstly, election of officials, secondly, election of the President of the Republic, thirdly, approval of the elections of Deputies, and, finally, determination of salaries of the President of the Republic and the Deputies. This business completed, the session to be closed. 3. The Deputies from Aleppo were confined to their hotels, ostensibly as a measure of protection, and every precaution was taken to prevent popular mani festations or disturbances. The military authorities took charge of public security. 4. The session opened at about 9 a.m.; a large number of notables had been invited to attend, but no invitation was extended to foreign representatives. 5. The High Commissioner's delegate and M. Helleu of the High Commissioner’s immediate staff were present with a number of other French officials. The text of the decree convening the Parliament was read, and the oldest Deputy, Mohamed Adali of Antioch, assumed the functions of President. Fakhri Raroudi called on the assembly to observe two minutes’ silence in memory of Fozi-el-Ghazi (paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 27 of the 29th April, 1930), the author of the Constitution. He then asserted the right of the Deputies to act according to their conscience without fear of external influences. Shaker Nimat Shabani (Aleppo) expressed his agreement. 6. The Acting President then endeavoured to proceed to business, when Zeki-el-Khatib (Damascus) commenced a long oration, and continued to speak in spite of the President’s injunctions : Faiz-el-Khouri (Damascus) also joined in, and a general uproar ensued. The President ordered a policeman to remove Faiz-el-Khouri, who refused to leave the tribune, aptly quoting Mirabeau : “ Nous sommes ici par la volonte du peuple, et nous n’en sortirons que par la puissance des baionnettes.” The policeman was ejected. The President adjourned the meeting for twenty minutes, until comparative calm was restored. 7. The session was reopened and lemonade was served to the Cabinet. Faiz-el-Khouri protested against the terms of the decree summoning the Parliament, which he stated was contrary to article 45 of the Constitution, and a discussion ensued between him and the High Commissioner’s delegate, from which it appeared that the French and Arabic texts do not agree. Nuri-el-Asfari (Idlib, Aleppo) intervened with a suggestion that the House should get on with the election of the President. 8. The result of the first ballot was Soubhi Barakat (Moderate) 28 votes, Hakki-el-Azm (pro-French) 23, Hashem-el-Atassi (Nationalist) 17. None of the candidates having polled half the votes, a second ballot was held. Nationalists abstained and Soubhi Barakat received 30 votes, Hakki-el-Azm 23, and Hashem- el-Atassi 2. Soubhi Barakat took the presidential chair, and stated that he would endeavour to work in harmony with all parties and in particular the Nationalists. 9. Other officials were then elected, the whole of the posts falling to Deputies from the north, with a regular vote of about 30. The officers appointed are : Vice-Presidents, Selim Jambert (Aleppo) and Mohammed-el-Fatih (Deir-ez-Zor); secretaries, Latif Ghanimeh (Aleppo) and Mohamed-el-Joreb (Alexandretta); [489 ee—1 ]“ Questeurs ” (internal administration of Parliament), A ref Jazzar (Jebel Sam an), Moise der Kaloustian (Antioch), and Minan Niazi (Izaz). 10. The Nationalist Deputies then asked for an adjournment, as it was clear that their candidate for the Presidency of the Republic could not hope for success; Shaker Nimat Shabani (Aleppo) opposed the motion, but Soubhi Rarakat suspended the session for half an hour, and w T hen it was resumed Shaker Nimat Shabani withdrew his objections, and it was decided to postpone the election of the President of the Syrian Republic until the 11th June. Soubhi Rarakat announced this decision and expressed his desire that Deputies should no longer be imprisoned in their hotels. 11. It is quite impossible to forecast the result. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty's High Commissioners at Ragdad and Jerusalem, the Rritish Resident at Amman, His Majesty’s consul-general at Reirut, and His Majesty’s consul at Aleppo.

Consul Hole to Sir John Simon.—(Received July 5.) (No. 47. Confidential.) ^ ir 5 Damascus, June 16, 1932. \\ ITH reference to my despatch No. 44 of the 8th June, regarding the first meeting of the Syrian Chamber, I have the honour to report that parliamentary business has now been concluded and the Chamber has adjourned until the autumn. 2. When the Parliament reassembled on the 11th June, the territorial scission, to which I alluded in paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 35 of the 7th May, was sharply in evidence. There were three candidates for the presidency of the republic—Soubhi Barakat, Aleppo, Moderate; Hashem-el-Atassi, Damascus, Nationalist; and Hakki-el-Azm, Damascus, Moderate; the last was the French nominee. The North Syrian bloc of thirty Deputies had shown clearly at the first sitting that they intended using their majority to impose their candidates, regardless of any other consideration, and the smaller groups of Hakki-el-Azm and Hashem-el-Atassi were equally resolved not to yield. On the 10th the Nationalists announced their withdrawal from the Parliament, alleging a variety of reasons, but in fact because their candidate had no hope of success. 3. The High Commissioner thus found himself confronted with a certain victory for Soubhi Barakat, originally his own nominee but now fallen from grace. Hakki-el-Azm was accordingly instructed to pass his votes to Mohamed Ali-el-Abed (who had meanwhile been completely discarded), the Nationalists agreeing to accept him rather than allow the north to sweep the board. He was duly elected and escorted to the presidential quarters among the enthusiasm of the nationalistic youth. 4. A salute of seventeen guns was fired and the new Syrian flag unfurled. It consists of three horizontal bars, green, white and black, for the Abbasid, Fatimid and Omayyad dynasties, respectively, with three red stars across the white, the motive of which eludes me. 5. The late Cabinet submitted its resignation to the new President, who accepted it on the 12th June. 6. Parliament met for the third time on the 13th June; two committees were appointed, the first to examine into the validity of the elections and the second to request the President to make representations to the French Government with a view to an amnesty for political offenders excluded from the benefits of the last. 7. The elections committee being composed exclusively of northern Deputies, it was unlikely that much attention would be paid to protests against the Aleppo elections. Accordingly, the fourth session on the 14th June was stormy, Nationalists endeavouring to discuss petitions publicly in full assembly instead of leaving them to the committee appointed the day before. A general uproar ensued, leaders shouting at one another, and finally the northern Deputies, including the President of the Chamber, left the building in high dudgeon. Faiz- el-Khoury took upon himself to adjourn the meeting and afterwards proceeded with Zeki-el-Khatib on an embassy to the northern headquarters; a touching reconciliation took place and the Chamber reassembled and passed the elections. 8. The only remaining business was to fix the emoluments of officials and and members. The President of the Republic is to receive 300,000 fr. per annum, and the President of the Chamber 120,000 fr. Individual members will have a monthly wage of 2,000 fr. with an annual bonus of 6,000 fr. 9. The new Cabinet has been formed by Hakki-el-Azm. who will also be Minister of the Interior. It will include Jamil Mardam, Minister of Finance and Agriculture; Mazhar Pasha Rislan, Nationalist, of Homs, as Minister of Justice and Education; and Selim Jambart, Moderate, of Aleppo, as Minister of [516 e— 1]1? /'r 2 ■ Public Works. The new Prime Minister, who is the soul of conciliation, has apportioned the plums to the satisfaction of the greatest number, and it is under stood that during the recess the Ministry will be chiefly concerned with economic questions. 10. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Bagdad, the British Resident at Amman, and His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Aleppo. 1 have, &amp;c.

Although Nationalist opinion had been sharply divided on the advisability of entering the elections, the success of their candidates furnished the occasion of exuberant rejoicings. 3 It was, however, difficult to sustain the note, and the electorate showed signs of flagging interest as politicians settled down to their “ combinazioni ” and nothing very much happened. The new Deputies then decided to return the congratulatory visits which they had received on their election, and made triumphal progresses to the different quarters every evening for a fortnight. These were the occasion of inflammatory speeches, most of which I am inclined to believe went a little further than the real sentiments of the orators. 4. Events in Syria increasingly reflect a conflict of opinion between the french delegates at Damascus and Aleppo, both of whom appear to be on excellent terms with their local Deputies. M. Lavastre is here thought to have inspired the creation at Aleppo of the new “ Free Constitutional party,” the main object of which is to transfer the centre of political activity—and the Chamber itself— to the north. M. Solomiae on the other hand is confidently stated to be completely identified with the Nationalist point of view, and Damascus expects Soubhi Barakat to be discarded like so many of his predecessors. The presidencies of the republic, the Chamber and the council are being dealt and redealt between Mohamed Ali Beg El Abid, Haqqi Beg El Azm and Hashem Beg El Atassy. 5. Parliament is not expected to open before the end of this month nor to sit for more than a few days for the election of these officials. It will then adjourn till M. Ponsot’s return from leave. 6. At yesterday’s annual commemoration of the “ Martyrs ”—Syrian patriots executed by Jemal Pasha—the customary speeches and poems'were delivered, all tending to complete independence and the expulsion of the European; one of these poems was so affecting as to reduce members of the committee to tears. There is little doubt that these are the real aspirations of the Arabs, though in calmer moments they will admit that in the past they have never been united, except under a foreign domination, and that the withdrawal of French troops would be followed by anarchy. 7. Meanwhile Nationalist leaders are being sharply criticised for their excessive readiness to negotiate with the French, and accused of placing their private advantage before the public interest. It is felt that they were wrong in agreeing to the bargain by which they obtained only six seats out of nine, and they are suspected of consenting to a further deal, by which they will secure two Ministries in the forthcoming Government, at the cost of their independence. Most of the censure is directed on Jemil Mardam Beg, who probably deserves it. 8. More serious is the growing impatience of commercial and' agricultural c lasses, who bear most of the burden of the taxes and derive very little benefit. The existing customs policy is incoherent and capricious and, for one individual who may be assisted by it, the rest of the market is certain to be mulcted. 9. The case of the agricultural classes is far worse, for they have no hope of passing the burden on to others. The system of taxation applied in 1926 has been rendered intolerable by subsequent fluctuations of exchange; since I reported on it in my despatch No. 86 of the 13th June, 1927, the position has in no way improved. As the farming class is unorganised and inarticulate—in [462 gg—1]rr short, because it cannot go on strike—its grievances are customarily ignored; for this the Syrian officials are perhaps more to blame than the french. 10. A succession of four bad years has not been compensated by any serious concessions on the part of overstaffed administrations anxious only to assure the payment of their own salaries. Failure of winter rains and a recent ground frost have entirely destroyed hill crops and the grapes in the plains, and whole districts are faced with the prospect of starvation. 11. There are many indications that the limit of endurance of the faring has nearly been reached. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Bagdad, the British Resident at Amman, His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirut, and His Majesty’s consul at Aleppo.

Sir, Damascus, Ayril 8, 1932. AT the date of my last political report (despatch No. 17, Confidential, of the llth February, 1932), the attitude of the Nationalist party towards the proposed elections was still undefined, but inclining on the whole to a boycott: their understanding of parliamentary institutions is extremely limited, and they could not conceive of occupying any position in a Chamber except that of an overwhelming majority, though it is possible that once in Parliament they will not be slow in discovering the privileges of a minority, nor backward in exploiting them. 2. Syrian politicians in Egypt and Geneva preached abstention from the elections, and for some time this simple method of remaining pure and incorruptible in the eyes of the electorate kept its strong appeal to Nationalist politicians : however, a number of their leaders decided for participation, with or without the consent of the party. Prolonged negotiations ensued with the French High Commissioner’s delegate, and agreement was reached that the elections would be free if the Nationalists guaranteed not to enter more than six candidates for the nine contested seats, the remainder being reserved for three pro-French Moslem candidates; at the last moment a seventh Nationalist insisted on standing, and in face of a warning from M. Solomiac that his entering would invalidate the compact, one of the official six Nationalists stood down and the primary elections were accordingly held on the 30th March with every circumstance of freedom. 3. The procedure which I had outlined to M. Solomiac on the 23rd December, 1931, and reported in my despatch No. 105 of the same date was applied in full, and complete satisfaction was expressed on all sides. The French military authorities occupied all strategic points with tanks and machine-gun parties, and took other exceptional measures to maintain public security, which are still in force. 4. The secondary elections took place on the 6th April; the same military precautions were taken and somewhat intensified in the square adjoining the municipality, which constituted the only polling station. This square, which was the scene of the riots of the 20th December, 1931, was occupied by a number of tanks and the issues were held by strong detachments of Senegalese. 5. The results are not quite complete : the tenth candidate failed to obtain more than half the total votes cast, and a further ballot will be held to-morrow. The list was inevitably headed by the Jewish Deputy, who was unopposed : six Nationalists follow, and two of the three French nominees. The full results with notes on the personalities are given in an appendix to this despatch. Rikabi Pasha, whom the delegation were most anxious to see elected, is second among the candidates who failed to obtain the requisite number of votes; the first is Nessib Bakri, an ex-leader of revolution turned moderate, but more to the Nationalists’ liking than Rikabi, who is hated and feared. 6. Sheikh Taj-ed-Din disregarded the High Commissioner's warning and entered his name as a candidate, and meeting M. Ponsot at the Legion d'Honneur ball a few days later was rewarded by as gross a personal affront as I have ever seen administered. He only succeeded in obtaining 112 votes, and leaves the political arena unregretted by anyone. 7. Monarchist candidates failed to register more than a very few votes, and a monarchist success is not to be expected unless there was some very special circumstance such as an immediate prospect of union with Iraq. 8. Nationalists are in high feather at the results and are already discounting the possibilities of achieving a majority in the Chamber There are in all sixty- [462 c—1]nine Deputies, of whom seventeen are avowed Nationalists returned chiefly by Damascus, Hama and Homs. The great majority of the Deputies are nonentities from the rural constituencies, whom it is hoped to gather into the Nationalist fold, at least when controversial issues are under discussion. 9. The Acting Administrator, Tawfiq-el-Hayani, on whose appointment I commented in paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 94 of the 23rd November, 1931, conducted the elections in such a way as to earn universal commendation. Wasseq-el-Muayyad, whom he replaced, is reported to be returning from leave immediately after the elections : it would be regrettable if the latter was again established in a position where his energy provoked such unfortunate results; his talents could be conveniently accommodated at the head of Posts and Telegraphs, which the departure of a French adviser has left vacant. 10 The French delegate, M. Solomiac, may be considered to have achieved a notable personal success in securing the election of Mohamed Ali Beg El Abed and Hakki Beg El Azm, in view of the most unpropitious atmosphere of the last three months, though he may expect small thanks from his countrymen. The High Commissioner does not seem to smile on him, and the French army detests him cordially for his failure to carry the original elections hy force on the 20th December, 1931. There is no doubt that he was wise to claim his promotion before he came to Damascus, the grave of so many promising reputations. 11.

Sir, I have the honour to report that on April 12th an attempt was made on the life of Suhhi Bey Barakat, at one time President of the state of Syria and now one of the recently elected deputies for Aleppo, at the Hotel Royal in this to,.n where he was staying. The would-he assassin was a student at the French School of Engineering named Abdel Basset Anis el Bana from Homs. His act was clearly premeditated. He had left his lodgings some days previously and had taken a room at the hotel in an assumed name. He had apparently hoped to catch his victim alone, hut no opportunity presented itself. He therefore chose the moment when, to receive the visit of the Greek-Orthodox Archbishop of Aleppo, Suhhi Bey had left the friends with whom he was talking in the lounge of the hotel and was advancing to greet his guest. He had drawn a revolver when the Archbishop with great presence of mind threw a chair at him, causing him to drop his weapon. He then drew a knife and in the ensuing scrimmage wounded several oeople, one of them, Suhhi Bey s His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, etc., etc., etc. , S.W.l. henchmanhenchman, rather seriously. Eventually he stabbed himself in the abdomen, causing wounds to which he later succumbed. Before his death he was seen, at his own request, by a representative of the High Commissioner, as well es by the judicial authorities, but he did not apparently make any disclosures implicating others. It is of course possible that he was acting at the instigation of the enemies of Subhi Bey who are numerous in extreme nationalist circles where he is regarded as a traitor. Abdel Basset was on the other hand apparently nervous and excitable and none too successful in his studies. It may therefore simply oe that he had become so saturated with politics ox an extremist tendency that his mental balance had been I have, etc. , (Sd.)

W ITH reference to my despatch No. 7 of the 4th January, I have the honour to transmit a summary report on political events since that date. 2. Ihe military dispositions reported in paragraph 2 of my despatch under reference were not relaxed till about a fortnight later, in consequence of a strike oi students and schoolchildren, declared on the 10th January in protest against the imprisonment of a number of secondary schoolboys for participation in the disturbances of the 20th December. Ihe strike lasted till the 26th January, when it was settled by the Educational Adviser to the High Commissioner, who persuaded the truants to return to their desks. He gave the impression that there would be no reprisals, but a number of ringleaders, mostly under eighteen years of age, have now been sentenced to several weeks of imprisonment. 3. strong pickets of Senegalese with steel helmets were posted at strategic points to provide against demonstrations. 4. The question of minorities has been the occasion of much ink-spilling during the period under review, the action of His Majesty s. Government in recommending- the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations aroused violent protestations in the local French press and in particular the Beirut “ Orient,” w hich published an appeal to the Syrian Christian and Jewish voters to ensure the election of a Government which would protect them from the fate of the minorities in Iraq ? which His Majesty’s Government was abandoning to massacre. 5. It has always been the policy of the mandatory Power to stress any differences between Moslems and Christians in Syria, and the Nationalist party have consequently striven to assert the complete union of all religious communities in the ties of patriotism. In the heated discussions that broke out in the press a sharp divergence of opinion became evident in the front ranks of the Nationalists, voiced by the editor of the “ Qabas ” and the Christian leader, Faiz-el-Khoury! As soon, however, as they perceived that they were playing into the hands of their adversaries they hastened to heal the breach. 6. No date has yet been announced for the elections to be held at Damascus, Hama, Daraya and Domna, nor has the Nationalist party decided whether or not to present candidates. Although it is probable that the Nationalists would secure the w'hole of the seats if the elections are free, these would only amount to twenty- two in a Chamber of sixty-eight members. Councils are divided as to whether it is tetter to be an articulate but impotent Opposition or to boycott the elections altogether. 7. M. Ponsot's excursion into activity has been unfortunately conducted. During my stay in Paris last year I gathered that the Quai d'Orsay was as anxious to settle the Syrian question as M. Ponsot to obtain a more comfortable Embassy, and that they were in agreement that a Syrian Chamber should be elected t conclude a treaty that would enable France to look forward to withdrawal fron the State of Syria and a corresponding reduction in the unpopular expenditure entailed by that portion of the mandate. This project coincided very closely with the desires of the politically-minded circles of Syria and even with those 'of the Nationalist party, whose views had been profoundly modified in the course of the last few years. 8. Unfortunately the High Commission is entirely out of touch with popular feeling and derives its information from a very narrow circle of politicians supple mented by an inefficient Service de Renseignements. Although it is most improbable that a freely-elected Chamber would have offered any serious oppo sition to M. Ponsot’s proposals, it would seem that a natural preference to work [408 a—2]2 with a declared pro-French Ministry added to the interested assurances of the present Ministers distorted M. Ponsot's view of the position. Even if the Nationalists had obtained a working majority in the Chamber, their powers to harm the mandatory Government would not have been increased; at the worst, the High Commissioner could have again prorogued the Assembly and pointed out with reason to the League of Nations that the country was not ripe for self- government. At the best, a satisfactory treaty could have been concluded. Above all, the Nationalists themselves would have been subjected to the crucible test of office, which might have welded them into a useful Government or in the contrary event achieved their disintegration. In any case, it would have put an end to their self-assertion as the only pure and incorruptible party. 9. Any of these results would be more acceptable to France than a continuance of the present stalemate. An arrangement concluded with the Assembly without the participation of the Nationalists runs the risk of repudiation if ever that party comes into power. If the treaty is on the lines of our treaty with Iraq, the risk is evidently small; but if it contains clauses, financial or other, which would justify the evident desire of the High Commission to deal with a Francophile Government, the danger is by no means negligible. 10.

Consul Monck-Mcism to Sir John Simon.—{Received February 22.) (No. 1. Confidential.) Alepi^o, January 22, 1932. WITH reference to ray despatch No. 61, Confidential, of the 24th December last on the subject of the Syrian elections of the first degree at Aleppo (alluded to by error as the secondary elections), I have the honour to report that the action of the French authorities can hardly be said to reflect credit upon the integrity of their methods or upon their reputation for sang-froid. 2. Protests made by the Nationalists were many, and took the form of gatherings in front of the houses of the Syrian Governor, the moderate Subhi Bey Barakat, and one or two other “ traitors ' to the Nationalist cause. A demonstration made by Moslem women was dispersed by cold w’ater from the hose pipes of the town fire-engine, and a similar demonstration made by a mixed crowd in front of Subhi Bey Barakat's house was fired on by a nervous constabulary before it had shown any intention of resorting to violence, one or two demonstrators and a Syrian gendarme being killed and a few people injured. According to information which I have received from a reliable source, much of the formal protest registered was the work of agitators, and not of the leaders of the Nationalist party at all. ihe latter, indeed, exhorted the people to remain quiet, and a humorous episode of the campaign occurred when a printed sheet circulated by Ibrahim Hanano counselling moderation was seized by the French authorities and copied for further distribution. 3. Since the disturbances of Christmas Day the defence of the public has not been left to the Syrian police and gendarmerie, but entrusted to the military. Rumours of an invasion of the town by Sheikh Mudjhem of the Anaze tribe moved large numbers of the more ignorant Moslem population to remove merchan dise from their shops to their homes, but, in general, enlightened opinion has been reassured by the display of military force. The elections in the second degree took place on the 3rd January, and'the results were a foregone conclusion. Voters were protected by a strong military force, with artillery and tanks. 4. The Nationalists are of course extremely bitter against the Moderates, who have “won ” the game, and it is felt that the prestige of the mandate has suffered by the refusal of the authorities to show the voting urns open before balloting took place, as well as by the methods of intimidation subsequently employed. The elected members are execrated by the mass of the population, and I hear that Subhi Bey Barakat will risk his life in going to Damascus. 5. The attitude towards the election campaign of the French authorities and the civilian French element may be judged by the remark of the assistant delegate that “ the Syrians are like naughty children, they have to be punished,” and by the description by a prominent and intellectual French lady, of the former delegate at Damascus, as a person who was not a good administrator “ he managed such and such elections very badly, the Nationalists got in.” In sharp contrast to this mentality was the criticism of M. Chauvet, of the French diplomatic career, on a visit to Aleppo, who had nothing but contempt for the methods employed and the officials who employed them. It is characteristic however, of the prejudices of his nation that he compared the defects of the trench mandate, not with the British mandate in Iraq and Palestine but with the awful possibility of an Italian mandate.

Consul Hole to Sir John Simon — (Received January 18.) (No. 7. Confidential.) Sir, Damascus, January 4, 1932. WITH reference to my despatch No. 104 of the 22nd December, 1931, regarding the disturbances on the occasion of the election, I have the honour to report on the progress of events till to-day. 2. The city is still in charge of the army, though a state of siege has not been proclaimed. The control has been made somewhat less ostentatious than on the first few days after the troubles; the curfew has been abolished and barricades removed, but strategic points in the town are strongly occupied and tanks and armoured cars are held in readiness. Pickets and patrols are numerous. 3. A committee has been formed to collect subscriptions on behalf of casualties in the disturbances; the members represent every section of the popula tion, and include many most reputable personages. 4. It seemed at one moment that M. Ponsot would arrive at complete agree ment with the National party : Wasseq-el-Muayyad and Bahij-el-Khatib were both removed and the general atmosphere of the discussions was friendly. But at the council of delegates held at the Residency on the 30th December, the proposal of M. Solomiac to postpone all elections was overruled and it was decided in accordance with M. Lavastre’s advice to proceed with the elections to-morrow in all districts, except Damascus, Hama and Douma, where they will be held at a date not yet fixed. 5. Damascus will be closed to-morrow in protest, and the attitude of the Nationalists towards the elections will depend on the Aleppo results : if the chief Nationalist candidates are elected, they will contest the elections at Damascus; otherwise they will boycott them. 6. In an interview, published on the 31st December, Jamil Beg Mardam Beg outlined the Nationalist demands—fresh elections in Damascus, Hama and Douma and eleven (of twenty-nine) wards in Aleppo, where it is asserted that practically the entire electorate has protested. As yet, this last demand has been refused, though no official statement has been issued by the Residency. 7. The High Commission invited the National party to include in its list three candidates who were acceptable to the French authorities, Nassouhi Beg El Boukhari, Mohamed Ali Beg El Abid, and Rida Pasha Rikabi. The first was already conditionally on their list; they had coquetted with the second for some time on account of his great wealth, but the third is anathema. Their reason for refusal was, however, based on the principle that in a free election a party chooses its own candidates. 8. I am glad to record that Nationalist leaders have refrained from any attempt to excite public feeling in somewhat tempting circumstances and seem to be animated by a sincere desire to reach agreement with the French Administration. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Bagdad, the British Resident at Amman, His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirut, and His Majesty’s consul at Aleppo.

It is perhaps necessary for a complete comprehension of events to point out that the police and municipal olhciais are not, as might be taken for granted, a permanent body of public servants at the orders of whatever Government may be in power. On the contrary, they are the personal henchmen of the Adminis trative Governor (Wasseq-el-Muayyad) and the chief of police (Bellij-el-Khatib), appointed by them in place of others dismissed without explanation, and bound to them by the strongest ties of personal interest. The same is true of even the lire brigade, which Wasseq-el-Muayyad has converted into a gang of partisans. 3. Both Wasseq-el-Muayyad and Behij-el-Khatib are aware that their future fortunes depend entirely on the return to power of Sheikh Taj-ed-Din, and that any other Government would dismiss them immediately. When it is added that in 1928 the former openly tampered with the ballot-boxes, it is easy to appreciate the deep suspicion of the Opposition and their insistence on guarantees of the freedom of the elections on the part of the High Commissioner. 4. M. Ponsot refused to intervene further than to remove Sheikh Taj-ed-Din and Jemil-el-Ulchi from ohiee—precautions that were entirely ineffective as long as Wasseq-el-Muayyad and Behij-el-Khatib remained in power. 5. The Electoral Law requires that the empty ballot-boxes shall be exhibited and then sealed by a committee before polling begins at 8 a.m. At the polling station in the Keimariyeh quarter, where Sheikh Taj-ed-Din and Jemil-el-Ulchi are candidates, Nationalist representatives arrived at 7 a.m. in order to exercise their right of inspection and were informed that the operation had taken place at 6 a.m. In the polling station at Qanawat a Nationalist named Zeki-el-Knatib insisted on remaining during the poll and was thrown out by the police. He applied to the High Commissioner’s delegate for authority to control the ballot but without success. He then returned and made an inflammatory speech to his constituents. 6. Excited crowds gravitated naturally to the Merje, a centrally situated square adjoining public offices, including the municipality. The firemen attempted to disperse the crowd, but the pumps were soon put out of action, and the crowd attacked firemen and police with stones. The latter emptied their revolvers into the crowd and retreated to the municipality, which was then itself attacked. 7. The French forces arrived and established calm, and the High Commissioner's delegate suspended the elections. Strategic points are still strongly occupied. The curfew has been imposed, and special measures taken for the defence of the Salhiyye quarter, where most of the French live. 8. It is hard to estimate casualties. Five were buried yesterday and others have since died. An immense crowd attended the funeral, but guarantees had been given that no demonstrations would occur if the police did not interfere. Speeches were made, one wild attack on the mandate by a Greek Orthodox priest who should have known better, but the Nationalist leader, Fakhri Baroudi, recommended the population to behave peaceably. 9. M. Solomiae has left this morning for Zahle to consult M. Ponsot and General Bigault de Grandrut. If it is decided to hold the elections again, it is only reasonable to hope that scrutineers from non-Government parties will be allowed to attend at the polling stations. Such a concession would have prevented the disturbances of the 20th. T354 m—1]n mmmm 10. Popular feeling has for the moment been allayed by the suspension of the elections. It is now concentrated on the six functionaries who iorm the back bone of Sheikh Taj-ed-Din’s party. A leaflet issued yesterday holds them up to public execration—Sheikh Taj-ed-Din, Jemil-el-Ulchi, Wasseq-el-Muayyad, JBehij-el-Khatib, Tawfiq Shamie and Abdul Kader-el-Khatib. ihe last is a creature of Sheik Taj-ed-Din, who holds the very lucrative post of Directoi of ^ Waqfs. There has been, curiously enough, no manifestation of hostility agains* the French Administration, and during the actual rioting the crowd took cart not to harm Frenchmen. 11. It has for some time been so patent that no free elections could possibly be held without change in the existing system, and that an attempt to enforce them could not but result in troubles that it is hard to understand how the French Administration failed to sum up the situation. It is natural that the High Commissioner should prefer to treat with a pro-French (jovernment, and that he should countenance the exertion of influences that might contribute to theii triumphant return; but it is surprising that he should believe that such barefaced trickery as was certain to be resorted to could possibly escape public notice. Apparently, he has allowed himself, for the second time, to be duped by Sheikh Tai-ed-Din, with whom the delegation is still in constant communication. 12.

Consid Monck-Mason to Sir John Simon.—[Received January 12, 1932.) (No. 61. Confidential.) Sir, Alcffo, December 24, 1931. I HAVE the honour to report that polling for the elections of the second degree for Deputies of Syria took place in Aleppo on Sunday, the 20th instant. There was considerable disturbance, but no bloodshed, and to that extent the elections may be said to have passed oft' “ normally.” 2. There is unfortunately no room for doubt that the system under which voting was carried out was anything but impartial, a number of urns having been “ seeded ” in the moderate interest before electors had a chance of recording their votes. The Nationalist party in Aleppo, who are, however, certainly much the strongest party, abstained in the circumstances from recording their votes. 3. The gerrymandering of the elections, attributed of course to the man datory authorities, has roused the indignation even of those Christians who approve any action of the authorities, whether fair or foul, which would prevent the Nationalists becoming supreme in the district. It is indeed a significant commentary on the political principles of the Christian element of Aleppo that the action of the authorities in “ faking ” an election to the disadvantage of the Nationalists should seem to them admirable. A single instance of this “ faking ” will suffice, as typical of many others. In the “ Wara-ed-Djami ” quarter of 703 persons summoned to vote, only 62 appeared with their lists, which they deposited in the urn. When the latter was opened, no less than 803 lists were found in the box 4. On the 22nd instant the local “ A1 Nahda ' newspaper distributed gratis in the Mahometan quarters an election supplement, which contained among other news the statement that the Nationalists w~ere acting as the tools of the British, by whom they were financed. The “ A1 Nahda ’* is a daily paper of very small circulation and no influence at all, and I attach no importance to these remarks. M. Lavastre, the Assistant Delegate, to whom I mentioned this article, agreed with me that there was no necessity to drag a friendly Power within the range of political animosities, and said he would prevent such press statements appearing- in the future. 5. The “ results ” of the elections at Aleppo are of course farcical, and it may seem remarkable that there was so little public effervescence. The reasons for this are : that the population of Aleppo is certainly more law-abiding and less warlike than that of Damascus; while the fact that 45 per cent, of the popu lation of the city is Christian and therefore in favour of a Christian mandatory rather than of a Mahometan authority is not without its influence on the question. There is, however, no elation over the “victory' of the moderates, who are identified simply with the French. 6. Protests are still being made to the Assistant Delegate, and street demonstrations take place periodically. The shops in the covered markets are closed, and the atmosphere is one of tension. It is not, however, likely that there will be bloodshed, as a considerable display of armed force, in the form of cavalry and tanks, is being made. 7. I enclose in original two letters^) written to me by Ibrahim Hanano, the local leader of the Nationalist party ; they speak for themselves, and the facts are as stated, except that the events of Damascus seem to have been exaggerated.

Consul Hole to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 28.j (No. 102. Confidential.) ^ ir &gt; ^ Damascus, December 17, 1931. SINCE I last reported to you in my despatch No. 100 of the 11th December, the political atmosphere has changed for the worse. 2. The immediate cause was a gang-fight which occurred on the 13th December, the outcome of a long-standing feud between Sheikh Taj-ed-Din- el-Hassani and Fakhri Baroudi. It is difficult to assign responsibilities, but there seems to be some justification for the Nationalist assertion that the intervention of the police was far from impartial. The customary strikes and demonstrations ensued, with the old threat of abstention from the elections. According to this morning’s press this threat will be carried out, but I have reason to believe that the National party will behave more sensibly. 3. In the meantime, political groups have formed and re-formed with something of the easy speed of the kaleidoscope. There are four parties in the field—the Government party (Sheikh Taj-ed-Din-el-Hassani), the Monarchists (Rikabi Pasha), the Reform party (Hakki-el-Azm), and the Nationalists. The monarchical idea has made great progress during the summer; the moderate pro-French views of the Reform party have also gained favour among thinking people. The Nationalists themselves had swung very near to the moderates, and had quite given up their old ideas of getting rid of the mandatory Power at any price. The election seemed to be an open event, with very small chance of a large majority for any party. 4. The upshot of last week’s political manoeuvres has been the formation of a loose coalition of the three parties against the Nationalists. The list of candidates (the only one yet published) is as follows :— Sheikh Taj-ed-Din-el-Hassani, ex-Acting President. Bedi-el-Muayyad, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce and the Acting Minister of Public Works, Reform party. Hussein Auni Beg El Qudmani, member of the Reform party. Rida Pasha Rikabi, chief of Monarchist party. Nessib Beg El Bakri, rebel in 1925, now supporter of Sheikh Taj-ed-Din-eL Hassani. Ata Beg El Ayoubi, moderate, has held office under Hakki Beg El Azm. Reshid Beg Tarabishi, moderate, and a notable of the Shaghour quarter. Zeki Beg Sukkar, a Meidan notable, colourless. Tawfiq Shamie, Minister of Finance (Greek Orthodox seat). Yussuf Liniado, colourless (Jew seat). 5. There are men of undoubted capacity in the group. However much Sheikh Taj-ed-Din-el-Hassani may be detested by a large section of the electorate, there can be no doubt of the political subtlety which has kept him in power for nearly four years. Rikabi Pasha has a very strong personality and long experience of government. Ata Beg El Ayoubi is one of the cleverest men in Syria. Bedi Beg El Muayyad and Tawfiq Shamie have both a good deal of administrative experience without any remarkable talents. The group thus presents the elements of a capable Government, while subject to the unavoidable internal strains of every coalition. 6. It is, however, a matter for sincere regret that the French Administra tion has not been successful in maintaining the excellent atmosphere which I recorded in my despatch No. 94 of the 23rd November. At that moment there was every prospect of the election of an Assembly of moderate views, enjoying popular confidence and fully prepared to co-operate with the mandatory Power. All that the High Commissioner needed to do was to keep the ring, to allows the [327 ee—1]fl 2 parties to fight the elections between them, while they themselves maintained an attitude of impartial benevolence. 7. This has unfortunately proved to be beyond their powers. If in point of fact they have not interfered, they have been so clumsy as to have every appearance of doing so. The Nationalists have consequently received a new ^ accession of strength, jind signs are not wanting that, instead of a contest between ^ one moderate Nationalist party and another slightly less moderate, the election will be fought as between the Nationalists and the mandatory Power. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Jerusalem, the British Resident at Amman, His Majesty s- High Commissioner at Bagdad, His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirut, and His- Majesty’s consul at Aleppo.

Pro ;reaa has been a little painful, the nationalists finding Monsieur Ponsot less tractable than the first effusions had led them to hope. Their endeavours to extract a statement of the broad lines of the future treaty and guarantee© of impartial elections were unsuccessful, Monsieur Ponsot eluding an interview with Hashem el-Atassl by paying a flying visit to Susida and returning direct to Beirut. 3. A meeting of the new Advisory Council was convened on the 7th November, not so much to advise as to listen to the High Commissioner *» statement of his intentions. Hashes* el-Atao»i did not attend. A slight passage of arms occurred between the High Commissioner and two of the members (Subhi bey darakat and damad Ahmad Namy bey) on the expediency of again inviting him, which repealed a somewhat more vigorous sympathy with his action than might have baen expected. The High Commissioner then read his speech, and distributed copies to the press. 4. f*© Principal Secretary of 6 tate Foreign Affairs, etc., etc., etc.4* Monsieur ionsot'e utterances are rare and intended to be final: X have therefore appended the full text as Enclosure No. 1 to this despatch. The chief passages of interest, besides the proclamation of the elections, deal with the impossibility of preliminary discussion of the treaty or modification of the existing electoral law, in spite of iia many admitted Imperfections. 5. The disappointment of the Nationalist Party was aggravated by the arrival of reports from the rural districts that the French administration is exerting pressure to secure the return of secondary electors who may be counted on to vote as directed. (I may remark that my own information corroborates thes;e reports). There was not however any serious probability of their abstention, and the two days that elapsed before the publication of their manifesto were spent rather in elaborating its style than in reaching a decision on its subject-matter. 6 . The manifesto, after a long and eloquent rehearsal of the nationalists 1 past efforts and disappointments in the service of the beat interests of Syria, announces their intention to contest the elections, in spite of the refusal of the High Commissioner to satisfy any of their legitimate demands; they have been Impelled to make this concession by the official declarations at Geneva and Damascus that France will conclude with the Government elected a treaty which will replace the hated unilateral mandate. They must take their place in the Assembly with full liberty of actionaction to defend their country’s Interests. However any sign of loyalty or sincerity on the French aide will call forth an immediate response on their part. 7.

The electoral law has many clauses which work in their disfavour; and the officials who will be in charge of the poll have already shown In 1928 that the nationalists have reason to dictrust them. It is however probable that the High Commissioner will not countenance any open manipulation of the votes, but rely on subtler methods such as a reshuffling of deputies under the Electoral Law. For example, the Greok Catholic community of Damascus, which in 1928 returned a nationalist member, will have no representative this year, while the Aleppo community will have its turn. Similarly,the : 4eidan quarter, which returned about 170 nationalist secondary electors, is now discovered to have a much smaller population and will only return 140. 9. All these questions are very academic. The High Commissioner will probably find that however the majority may label itself it will in the main trend towards the nationalist view as soon as the chamber meets. Arabs are extremely susceptible to eloquence, which indeed they rate among the three cardinal virtues and it is evident that the nationalist theme lends itself(Signed) K. C. HOLE itself to oratory. There is however very little difference In view between nationalists, moderates and indeed the High Commission itcelf, and it should not be too hard for then to work together as far as the signature of a treaty on the lines of ours with Iraq. UnfortTinetely both French and Syrians are unnecesearily insistent on maintaining their formulas and generally saving face, and the event la continually at the mercy of a childish fit of petulance on one side or the other. For the moment there is a most unusual display of sweet reasonableness on all eides and Ramadan may well find the lion lying down with the lamb according to the best precedents. 10 .

CONFIDENTIAL. 1 7924 Section 1. 1 E 5980/656/89] No.( 1:V , Consul Hole to Sir John Simon.—[Received December 2.) (No. 94.) Sir, Damascus, November 23, 1931. WITH reference to my telegram No. 7 of the 20th November, reporting the dismissal of Sheikh Tajeddin and the proclamation of elections to be held in January, I have the honour to transmit the text of three decrees and the covering letter addressed to the late President of the Council. 2. The first decree creates a consultative council to advise the High Commissioner with regard to the application of the organic statute. The council is composed of past and present high officers of the State of Syria, the rector of the Syrian University, and the presidents of the Chambers of Commerce of Damascus and Aleppo. 3. The functions of the council are purely advisory, and the High Commissioner has power to invite to its.sessions (which he will call himself) any person whose views he wishes to hear. 4. I have extracted the list of members from decree No. 1 of the 19th November, and appended it, with notes on the political colouring of individuals, as Enclosure No. 2(') to this despatch. 5. Nationalist circles expressed some dissatisfaction with the composition of the council, holding that the number of Nationalist members in no way reflected the proportion of Nationalists in the electorate; but, as soon as the terms of the decree had been more carefully digested, it w r as seen that there was little danger of the council's doing them any harm. 6. The second decree provides for carrying on the administration of the State of Syria until the elections. Its effect is to discard the President of the Council and his unpopular Minister of the Interior, Jemil-el-Ulchi, and to leave the business of the Government in the hands of the four other members of the Cabinet, with the assistance of a Secretariat-General. 7. The question of the Secretariat-General excited some apprehension among Nationalists, who assumed that it w r as a disguise for direct and autocratic government by the High Commissioner, and that the chief role in the Secretariat would be played by a French official. These fears have been in part allayed by the appointment as Secretary-General of Tawfiq-el-Hayani, the Mutassarrif of the Hauran, in conjunction with Bedi' Beg El-Muayyad, the present Minister of Agriculture and Commerce and the Acting Minister of Public Works. The former is a native of Aleppo, and not unknown in Damascus ; T understand that he is a capable official, without political leanings, and not obnoxious to the Nationalist group. Bedi'JBeg El-Muayyad is admittedly Francophile, hut his personal reputation is not such as to excite any apprehensions. 8. By the third decree, the High Commissioner assumes the functions of the Chief of the State of Syria for the purpose of the elections, the only other article providing for his consulting the Advisory Council should occasion’ arise. 9. The promulgation of these decrees is too recent for me to report on their full effect. Nothing in M. Ponsot's past administration had prepared the Syrians for such rapid and decisive action. The first impression of complete shock was followed by a suspicion, not yet quite dissipated, that it was all too good to be true. Two inconclusive meetings have been held by the Nationalist party to decide what reception to accord to the Hi$h Commissioner's proclamations; on the arrival of the outlying representatives, a plenary meeting will be convened, and an attitude decided on. 10. In spite of the very remarkable concessions to Nationalist feeling made by the High Commissioner in dismissing Sheikh Tajeddin and Jemil-el-IJlchi, who might be counted on to do their best to rig the elections against them, the Nationalist leaders are still very suspicious They assert that the presence of the Administrative Governor of Damascus, Wasseq Bey Muayyad, the Acting f 1 ) Not printed.
