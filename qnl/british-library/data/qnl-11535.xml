CHAPTER XXI. the people of al-madinah. Al-Madinah contains but few families descended from the Prophet's Auxiliaries. I heard only of four whose genealogy is undoubted. These were,— 1. The Bayt al-Ansari, or descendants of Abu Ayyub, a most noble race whose tree ramifies through a space of fifteen hundred years. They keep the keys of the Kuba Mosque, and are Imams in the Harim, but the family is no longer wealthy or powerful. 2. The Bayt Abu Jud: they supply the Harim with Imams and Mu'ezzins. 1 I was told that there are now but two surviving members of this family, a boy and a girl. 3* The Bayt al-Sha ab, a numerous race. Some of the members travel professionally, others trade, and others are employed in the Harim. 4- The Bayt al-Karrani, who are mostly engaged in commerce. There is also a race called Al-Nakhaw ilah, 2 who, • 1 ^ J uba y r rel ates that in his day a descendant of Belal. the atAUMadinah 2111 ^ ^ P ractised his ancestral profession cultL^lTTl iS t0 ^ the Plural of Nakhwali,—one who tivates the date tree, a gardener or farmer.

As far as I could ascertain, they abuse the Shaykhayn (AbuBakrand Omar): all my informants agreed upon this point, but none could tell me why they neglected to bedevil Osman, the third object of hatred to the Shi'ah persuasion. They are numerous and warlike, yet they are despised by the townspeople, because they openly profess heresy, and are moreover of humble degree. They have their own priests and instructors, although subject to the orthodox Kazi; marry in their own sect, are confined to low offices, such as slaughtering animals, sweeping, and gardening, and are not allowed to enter the Harim during life, or to be carried to it after death. Their corpses are taken down an outer street called the Darb al-Janazah—Road of Biers—to their own cemetery near Al-Bakia. They dress and speak Arabic, like the townspeople ; but the Arabs pretend to distinguish them by a peculiar look denoting their degradation : it is doubtless the mistake of effect for cause, about all such 'Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast.' A number of reports are current about the horrid hazard a conjecture that they may be identical with the Mutawalli (also written Mutawilah, Mutaalis, Metoualis, &amp;c., &amp;c.), the hard/, courageous, and hospitable mountaineers of Syria, and Ccelesyria Proper. This race of sectarians, about 35,000 in number, holds tfl the Imamship or supreme pontificate of Ali and his descendants. They differ, however, in doctrine from the Persians, believing in a transmigration of the soul, which, gradually purified, is at last 'orbed into a perfect star.' They are scrupulous of caste, and will not allow a Jew or a Frank to touch a piece of their furniture: yet they erect guest-houses for Infidels. In this they resemble the Shi'ahs, who are far more particular about ceremonial purity than the Sunnis. They use ablutions before each meal, and herein remind us of the Hindus.XXI.—The People of A l-Madimh. 3 customs of these people, and their community of women 1 with the Persian pilgrims who pass through the town. It need scarcely be said that such tales coming from the mouths of fanatic foes are not to be credited. I regret not having had an opportunity to become intimate with any of the Nakhawilah, from whom curious information might be elicited. Orthodox Moslems do not like to be questioned about such hateful subjects; when I attempted to learn something from one of my acquaintance, Shaykh Ula al-Din, of a Kurd family, settled at Al-Madinah, a man who had travelled over the East, and who spoke five languages to perfection, he coldly replied that he had never consorted with these heretics. Sayyids and Sharifs, 2 the de scendants of the Prophet, here abound. The Benu Hosayn of Al-Madinah have their head-quarters at Suwayrkiyah : 8 the former place contains six or seven families ; the latter, ninety-three or ninety-four. Anciently they were much more numerous, and such was their power, that for cen- turies they retained c harge of the Prophet's tomb. They 1 The communist principles of Mazdak the Persian (sixth century) have given his nation a permanent bad fame in this par ticular among the Arabs. 2 In Arabia the Sharif is the descendant of Hasan through his two sons.

At Al-Madinah they live chiefly at the Hosh Ibn Sa'ad, a settlement outside the town and south of the Darb al-Janazah. There is, however, no objection to their dwelling within the walls; and they are taken to the Harim after death, if there be no evil report against the individual. Their burial-place is the Bakia cemetery. The reason of this toleration is, that some are supposed to be Sunni, or orthodox, and even the most heretical keep their ' Rafz 1 ' (heresy) a profound secret. Most learned Arabs believe that they belong, like the Persians, to the sect of Ali: the truth, however, is so vaguely known, that I could find out none of the peculiarities of their faith, till I met a Shirazi friend at Bombay. The Benu Hosayn are spare dark men of Badawi appearance, and they dress in the old Arab style still affected by the Sharifs,—a Kufiyah (kerchief) on the head, 2 and a Banish, a long and wide-sleeved garment resembling our magi cians' gown, thrown over the white cotton Kamis (shirt) : in public they always carry swords, even when others leave weapons at home. There are about two hundred families of Sayyid Alawiyah,—descendants of Ali by anj of his wives but Fatimah,—they bear no distinctive marl: in dress or appearance, and are either employed at the 1 ' Refusing, rejecting.' Hence the origin of Rdfizi,—'arejector, a heretic,' •• Inna rafaznahum,'—'verily we have rejected them,' (Abu Bakr, Omar, and Osman,) exclaim the Persians, glorying in the opprobrious epithet. 2 Sayyids in Al-Hijaz, as a general rule, do not denote theii descent by the green turband. In fact, most of them wear a rec Kashmir shawl round the head, when able to afford the luxury. The green turband is an innovation in Al-Islam. In some countries it is confined to the Sayyids ; in others it is worn as a mark of dis tinction by pilgrims.

Of the Khalifiyah, or de- im- scendants of Abbas, there is, I am told, but one house- our hold, the Bayt Al-Khalifah, who act as Imams in the ;es- Harim, and have charge of Hamzah's tomb. Some [bn declare that there are a few of the Siddikiyah, or descend- the ants from Abu Bakr ; others ignore them, and none could to give me any information about the Benu Najjar, the The rest of the population of Al-Madinah is a motley the race composed of offshoots from every nation in Al-Islam. ;ry. The sanctity of the city attracts strangers, who, purposing sed to stay but a short time, become residents; after finding ical some employment, they marry, have families, die, and are ost buried there with an eye to the spiritual advantages of .ns t the place. I was much importuned to stay at Al- tely Madinah. The only known physician was one Shaykh 3 of Abdullah Sahib, an Indian, a learned man, but of so fhe melancholic a temperament, and so ascetic in his habits, ice, that his knowledge was entirely lost to the public. ' Why the dost thou not,' said my friends, ' hire a shop somewhere ish, near the Prophet's Mosque ? There thou wilt eat bread igi&lt; y thy skill, and thy soul will have the blessing of being rt): on holy ground.' Shaykh Nur also opined after a short lers residence at Al-Madinah that it was bara jannati Shahr, a red ' very heavenly City,' and little would have induced him an) at ^ his home • The present ruling race at AI- arl Madinah, in consequence of political vicissitudes, is the th« ^ fat ' sonsof Turkish fathers by Arab mothers.

The Indians are not so reas numerous in proportion here as at Meccah; still Hindu- tion stani is by no means uncommonly heard in the streets, atte They preserve their peculiar costume, the women persist- part ing in showing their faces, and in wearing tight, exceed- to tl ingly tight, pantaloons. This, together with other reasons, lem secures for them the contempt of the Arabs. At Al- appl Madinah they are generally small shopkeepers, especially pape druggists and sellers of Kumash (cloth), and they form a sum society of their own. The terrible cases of misery and it is starvation which so commonly occur among the improvi- citiz dent Indians at Jeddah and Meccah are here rare. The Hanafi school holds the first rank at Al-Madinah who as in most parts of Al-Islam, although many of th« thesi citizens, and almost all the Badawin, are Shafe'is. Th&lt; reader will have remarked with astonishment that at on( poor of the fountain-heads of the faith, there are several race: P urs of schismatics, the Benu Hosayn, the Benu Ali, and th( an d Nakhawilah. At the town of Safra there are said to bt a number of the Zuyud schismatics, 1 who visit Al who Madinah, and have settled in force at Meccah, and som( dina declare that the Bayazi sect 2 also exists. The citizens of Al-Madinah are a favoured race, al sett \ ( though the city is not, like Meccah, the grand mart of th orari Moslem world or the meeting-place of nations.

As has before been shown, all the numerous reets. attendants at the Mosque are paid partly by the Sultan, ;rsist- partly by Aukaf, the rents of houses and lands bequeathed :ceed- to the shrine, and scattered over every part of the Mos- isons, lem world. When a Madani is inclined to travel, he .t Al- applies to the Mudir al-Harim, and receives from him a ciallj paper which entitles him to the receipt of a considerable orm a sum at Constantinople. The ' Ikram ' (honorarium), as y and it is called, varies with the rank of the recipient, the provi- citizens being divided into these four orders, viz. First and highest, the Sadat (Sayyids), 1 and Imans, iinah who are entitled to twelve purses, or about ^'60. Of f th« these there are said to be three hundred families. 1 h( 1 he Khanahdan, who keep open house and receive it om P 001 ' strangers gratis.

There are ?g in 8 few store-keepers, and their dealings are petty, because •ntin- articles of every kind are brought from Egypt, Syria, and iwait Constantinople. As a general rule, labour is exceedingly irded expensive, 1 and at the Visitation time a man will demand hich, fifteen or twenty piastres from a stranger for such a even trifling job as mending an umbrella. Handicraftsmen ;ites. and artisans—carpenters, masons, locksmiths, potters, soon and others—are either slaves or foreigners, mostly Egypt- corn- ians. a This proceeds partly from the pride of the people.

Added to this pride are indolence, and the true Arab prejudice, which, even in the present day, prevents a Badawi from marrying the daughter of an artisan. Like Castilians, all they consider labour humiliating to any but a slave ; nor is this, as a clever French author remarks, by any means an unreasonable idea, since Heaven, to punish man for disobedience, caused him to eat daily bread by the sweat of his brow. Besides, there is degradation, moral and physical, in handiwork compared with the freedom of the Desert. The loom and the file do not conserve courtesy and chivalry like the sword and spear; man ' extends his tongue,' to use an Arab phrase, when a cuff and not a stab is to be the consequence of an injurious expression Even the ruffian becomes polite in California, where his brother-ruffian carries his revolver, and those European nations who were most polished when every gentleman wore a rapier, have become the rudest since Civilisation disarmed them. By the tariff quoted below it will be evident that Al-Madinah is not a cheap place. 1 Yet the citizens, i The market is under the charge of an Arab Muhtasib cr Bazar-master, who again is subject to the Muhafiz or Pashi governing the place. The following was the current price of provision! at Al-Madinah early in August, 1853: during the Visitation seasoi everything is doubled:— 1 lb. mutton, 2 piastres, (beef is half-price, but seldom eater; there is no buffalo meat, and only Badawin will touch the camel. A fowl, 5 piastres. Eggs, in summer 8, in winter 4, for the piastre. 1 lb. clarified butter, 4 piastres, (when cheap it falls to 2J. Buttff is made at home by those who eat it, and sometimes by tte Egyptians for sale). 1 lb. milk, 1 piastre. 1 lb. cheese, 2 piastres, (when cheap it is 1, when dear 3 piastres per lb.) Whcaten loaf weighing 12 dirhams, loparahs. (There are loav(S of 24 dirhams, costing ^ piastre.) 1 lb. dry biscuits, (imported), 3 piastres.XXI.—The People of Al-Madinah. 11 despite their being generally in debt, manage to live well. Their cookery, like that of Meccah, has borrowed some thing from Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Persia, and India: as all Orientals, they are exceedingly fond of clarified butter. 1 i lb. of vegetables, ^ piastre. i Mudd dates, varies according to quality from 4 piastres to 100. 1 lb. grapes, piastre. A lime, 1 parah. A pomegranate, from 20 parahs to 1 piastre. A water-melon, from 3 to 6 piastres each. 1 lb. peaches, 2 piastres. 1 lb. coffee, 4 piastres, (the Yamani is the only kind drunk here). 1 lb. tea, 15 piastres, (black tea, imported from India). 1 lb. European loaf-sugar, 6 piastres, (white Egyptian, 5 piastres brown Egyptian, 3 piastres; brown Indian, for cooking and conserves, 3 piastres). 1 lb. spermaceti candles, 7 piastres, (called wax, and imported from Egypt). 1 lb. tallow candles, 3 piastres. 1 Ardeb wheat, 295 piastres. 1 Ardeb onions, 33 piastres, (when cheap 20, when dear 40). 1 Ardeb barley, 120 plasties, (minimum 90, maximum 180). 1 Ardeb rice, Indian, 302 piastres, (it varies from 260 to 350 piastres, according to quality). Durrah or maize is generally given to animals, and is very cheap. Barsim (clover, a bundle of) 3 Wakkiyahs, (36 Dirhams), costs 1 parah. Adas or Lentil is the same price as rice. 1 lb. Latakia tobacco, 16 piastres. 1 lb. Syrian tobacco, 8 piastres. 1 lb. Tumbak (Persian), 6 piastres.' 1 lb. olive oil, 6 piastres, (when cheap it is 4). A skin of water, ^ piastre. Bag of charcoal, containing 100 Wukkah, 10 piastres. The best kind is made from an Acacia called 'Samur.' The Tarah (Turkish), Faddah (Egyptian), or Diwani (Hijazi word), is t e 40th part of a piastre, or nearly the quarter of a farthing. The piastre is about 2 and two-fifths pence. Throughout Al-Hijaz there is no want of small change, as in Egypt, where the deficiency calls for the attention of the Government. 1 Physiologists have remarked that fat and greasy food, contain-12 Pilgyttnagc to Al-Mcidmcih and Meccah. I have seen the boy Mohammed drink off nearly a moi tumbler-full, although his friends warned him that it sav would make him as fat as an elephant.

During the whole time of my LyWi stay I had to content myself with a single bottle of Cog- 0 nac, coloured and scented to resemble medicine. The Madani are, like the Meccans, a curious mixture of gener osity and meanness, of profuseness and penuriousness hont But the former quality is the result of ostentation, the o latter is a characteristic of the Semitic race, long ago d bj made familiar to Europe by the Jew.

Above all their qualities, personal conceit is re- rsel. markable: they show it in their strut, in their looks, and vha almost in every word. ' I am such an one, the son of 3g • such an one,' is a common expletive, especially in times of m. danger; and this spirit is not wholly to be condemned, as u. ^ c r ertainl y acts a s an incentive to gallant actions.

The Arabs, like the Egyptians, all marry. Yet, as usual, they are hard and facetious upon that ill-treated subject—matrimony. It has exercised the brain of their wits and sages, who have not failed to indite notable things concerning it. Saitft ' Harikar al-Hakim ' Dominie Do-All) to his nephew Nadan (Sir Witless), whom he would dissuade from taking to himself a wife, ' Marriage is joy for a month and sorrow for a life, and the paying of settlements and the breaking of back {i.e. under the load of misery), and the listening to a woman's tongue ! ' And again we have in verse :— 'They said 'marry!* I replied, 'far be it from me To take to my bosom a sackful of snakes. I am free—why then become a slave? May Allah never bless womankind!' ' And the following lines are generally quoted, as affording a kind of bird's-eye view of female existence ;— ' From 10 (years of age) unto 20, A repose to the eyes of beholders. 1 From 20 unto 30, Still fair and full of flesh. From 30 unto 40, A mother of many boys and girls. From 40 unto 50, An old woman of the deceitful. From 50 unto 60, Slay her with a knife. From 60 unto 70, The curse of Allah upon them, one and all!' Another popular couplet makes a most unsupported as sertion:— 'They declare womankind to be heaven to man, I say, 'Allah, give me Jahannam, and not this heaven.' ' Yet the fair sex has the laugh on its side, for these railers at Al-Madinah as at other places, invariably marry. Ths 1 A phrase corresponding with our 'beauti du diable.'XXI.—The People of Al-Madinah. 23 marriage ceremony is tedious and expensive. It begins with a Khitbah or betrothal: the father of the young man repairs to the parent or guardian of the girl, and at the end of his visit exclaims, ' The Fatihah ! we beg of your kindness your daughter for our son.' Should the other be favourable to the proposal, his reply is, ' Welcome and congratulation to you : but we must perform Istik- harah 1 (religious lot casting) ' ; and, when consent is given, both pledge themselves to the agreement by re citing the Fatihah. Then commence negotiations about the Mahr or sum settled upon the bride 2 ; and after the smoothing of this difficulty follow feastings of friends and relatives, male and female. The marriage itself is called Akd al-Nikah or Ziwaj. A Walimah or banquet is pre pared by the father of the Aris (groom), at his own house, and the Kazi attends to perform the nuptial ceremony, the girl's consent being obtained through her Wakil, any male relation whom she commissions to act for her. Then, with great pomp and circumstance, the Aris visits his Arusah (bride) at her father's house ; and finally, with a Zuffah or procession and sundry ceremonies at the Hanm, she is brought to her new home. Arab funerals are as simple as their marriages are complicated. Neither Naddabah (myriologist or hired keener), nor indeed any female, even a relation, is present at burials as in other parts of t he Moslem world, 8 and it is esteemed disgraceful 1 This means consulting the will of the Deity, by praying for a dream in sleep, by the rosary, by opening the Koran, and other such evices. which bear blame if a negative be deemed necessary It is a custom throughout the Moslem world, a relic, doubtless, of the ai ^ 0r v ^ (seven divinin g-arrows) of the Pagan times.

The Prophet, who doubtless moved had heard of those pagan mournings, where an effeminate sand ^ and unlimited display of woe was often terminated by Kubay licentious excesses, like the Christian's half-heathen uiwiefc ' wakes,' forbad aught beyond a decent demonstration of ance b grief. And his strong good sense enabled him to see nowpr through the vanity of professional mourners. At Al-lMa* m resj dinah the corpse is interred shortly after decease. The leave t bier is carried though the streets at a moderate pace, by al-Har friends and relatives, 1 these bringing up the rear. Every Mosqu man who passes lends his shoulder for a minute, a mark E end of respect to the dead, and also considered a pious and a n(;)t a F prayerful act. Arrived at the Harim, they carry the Egypt: corpse in visitation to the Prophet's window, and pray for A1 over it at Osman's niche. Finally, it is interred after the purely usual Moslem fashion in the cemetery Al-Bakia. tlc ' ma Al-Madinah, though pillaged by the Wahhabis, still wa s cs abounds in books. Near the Harim are two Madrasah or benng colleges, the Mahmudiyah, so called from Sultan Mahmud, ^ Cc and that of Bashir Agha : both have large stores of theo- the M logical and other works. I also heard of extensive private ^ *7 collections, particularly of one belonging to the Najib al- Ashraf, or chief of the Sharifs, a certain Mohammed Jamal Magic al-Layl, whose father is well-known in India.

But none of my informants claimed pray for Al-Madinah any facilities of studying other than the irthc purely religious sciences. 2 Philosophy, medicine, arithme tic, mathematics, and algebra cannot be learnt here.

And though Niebuhr has been deserved; i The only abnormal sound amongst the consonants heai here and in Al-Hijaz generally is the pronouncing of A (j): hard g—for instance, 'Gur'Sn' for 'Kur'an' (a Koran), and Hag or Hakki (my right). This g, however , is pronounced deep in tt throat, and does not resemble the corrupt Egyptian pronunciatit of the jim (j, ^), a letter which the Copts knew not, and whii their modern descendants cannot articulate. In Al-Hijaz, the oil abnormal sounds amongst the vowels are o for u, as Khokh, a peac and o for u, as Ohod for Uhud. The two short vowels fath and h are correctly pronounced, the former never becoming a short e, as: Egypt (El for A1 and Yemen for Yaman), or a short t, as in Syi ('min' for 'man' who? &amp;c.)

On the present occasion a Hamidah 1 happened to strike the camel of a Hazimi which had trespassed ; upon which ' the Hazimi smote the Hamidah, and called him a rough name. The Hamidah instantly shot the Hazimi, the tribes were called out, and they fought with asperity for some days.

The Eastern portion contains was the body of Al-Hasan, the son of Ali and grandson of felt the Prophet 1 ; the Imam Zayn al-Abidin, son of Al- to h Hosayn, and great-grandson to the Prophet; the Imam owr Mohammed al-Bakir (fifth Imam), son to Zayn al-Abidin; and his son the Imam Ja'afar al-Sadik—all four descen- witl dants of the Prophet, and buried in the same grave with folk Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, uncle to Mohammed. It is of t almost needless to say that these names are subjects of and great controversy. Al-Musudi mentions that here was Mei found an inscribed stone declaring it to be the tomb of the Pro Lady Fatimah, of Hasan her brother, of Ali bin Hosayn, Pea of Mohammed bin Ali, and of Ja'afar bin Mohammed. beei Ibn Jubayr, describing Al-Bakia, mentions only two in You this tomb. Abbas and Hasan; the head of the latter, he Ble: says, in the direction of the former's feet. Other authors Mig i Burckhardt makes a series of mistakes upon this subject. 'Hassan ibn Aly, whose trunk only lies buried here (in El Bakia), his head having been sent to Cairo, where it is preserved in the fine ^ Mosque called TLX-Hassanya.' The Mosque Al-Hasanayn (the 'two as t Hasans') is supposed to contain only the head of W-Hosayn, which, when the Crusaders took Ascalon, was brought from thence by 1 Sultan Salih or Beybars, and conveyed to Cairo. As I have said anc1 ' before, the Persians in Egypt openly show their contempt of this t ^ e y tradition. It must be remembered that Al-Hasan died poisoned at :: Al-Madinah by his wife Ja'adah. Al-Hosayn, on the other hand, was han&lt; slain and decapitated at Kerbela. According to the Shi'ahs, Zayn for t al-Abidin obtained from Yazid, after a space of forty days, his Som father's head, and carried it back to Kerbela, for which reason the feel i event is known to the Persians as 'Chilleyeh sar o tan,' the 'forty ^ res: days of (separation between) the head and trunk.' They vehemently ^ 0U£ deny that the body lies at Kerbela, and the head at Cairo. Others, P' aci again, declare that Al-Hosayn's head was sent by Yazid to Amir bin P ure al-As, the governor of Al-Madinah, and was by him buried near 11:16 ^ Fatimah's Tomb. Nor are they wanting who declare, that after com : Yazid's death the head was found in his treasury, and was shrouded tra&lt; ^ and buried at Damascus. Such is the uncertainty which hangs over ln the early history of Al-IslamXXH.—A Visit to the Saints' Cemetery. 41 relate that in it, about the ninth century of the Hijrah, was found a wooden box covered with fresh-looking red felt cloth, with bright brass nails, and they believe it to have contained the corpse of Ali, placed here by his own son Hasan. Standing opposite this mysterious tomb, we repeated, with difficulty by reason of the Persians weeping, the following supplication:—'Peace be upon Ye, O Family of the Prophet! O Lord Abbas, the free from Impurity and Uncleanness, and Father's Brother to the Best of Men! And Thou too O Lord Hasan, Grandson of the Prophet! And thou also O Lord Zayn al-Abidin 1 ! Peace be upon Ye, One and All, for verily God hath been pleased to deliver You from all Guile, and to purify You with all Purity. The Mercy of Allah and His Blessings be upon Ye, and verily He is the Praised, the Mighty !' After which, freeing ourselves from the hands of greedy boys, we turned round and faced the southern wall, close to which is a tomb attributed to the Lady Fatimah. 2 I will not repeat the prayer, it being the same as that recited in the Harim. 1 The names of the fifth and sixth Imams, Mohammed al-Bakia and Ja'afar al-Sadik, were omitted by Hamid, as doubtful whether they are really buried here or not. 2 Moslem historians seem to delight in the obscurity which hangs over the lady's last resting-place, as if it were an honour even for the receptacle of her ashes to be concealed from the eyes of men. Some place her in the Harim, relying upon this tradition: 41 Fatimah, feeling about to die, rose up joyfully, performed the greater ablution, dressed herself in pure garments, spread a mat upon the floor of her house near the Prophet's Tomb, lay down fronting the Kiblah, placed her hand under her cheek, and said to her attendant, 'I am pure and in a pure dress; now let no one uncover my body, but bury me where I lie!' When Ali returned he found his wife dead, and complied with her last wishes. Omar bin Abd al-Aziz believed this tradition, when he included the room in the Mosque; and generally in Al-Islam Fatimah is supposed to be buried in the Harim. Those who suppose the Prophet's daughter to be buried in Al-Bakia relyPilgyimcige to Al-Madinah and Meccah.

His body Dist was bathed and shrouded by Ali and Omar Salmah. Others say that whoi Asma Bint Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr, was present with Fatimah, ance who at her last hour complained of being carried out, as was the custom of those days, to burial like a man. Asma promised to make 1 1 her a covered bier, like a bride's litter, of palm sticks, in shape like Deal what she had seen in Abyssinia: whereupon Fatimah smiled for the Prai first time after her father's death, and exacted from her a promise to \Yor allow no one entrance as long as her corpse was in the house. Ayishah, shortly afterwards knocking at the door, was refused ad- mittance by Asma; the former complained of this to her father, and j declared that her stepmother had been making a bride's litter to p carry out the corpse. Abu Bakr went to the door, and when informed re iigi ( by his wife that all was the result of Fatimah's orders, he returned p reve home making no objection. The death of the Prophet's daughter might was concealed by her own desire from high and low; she was buried bier, at night, and none accompanied her bier, or prayed at her grave Qver except Ali and a few relatives. The Shi'ahs found a charge ol li^g p irreverence and disrespect against Abu Bakr for absence on thii i a y ^ occasion.

Over her tomb was written, ' The grave hath not closed upon one like Fatimah, daughter of As'ad.' Historians relate that Mohammed n tnii lay down in only four graves: 1. Khadijah's, at Meccah. 2.

It is visited as containing the tomb of the Prophet's paternal aunts, especially of Safiyah, daughter of Abd al-Muttalib, sister of Hamzah, and one of the many heroines of early Al-Islam. Hurrying over our devotions here,—for we were tired indeed,—we applied to a Sakka for water, and entered a little coffee-house near the gate of the town: after which we rode home. I have now described, at a wearying length I fear, the spots visited by every Zair at Al-Madinah. The guide-books mention altogether between fifty and fifty- five Mosques and other holy places, most of which are now unknown even by name to the citizens. The most celebrated of these are the few following, which I describe from hearsay. About three miles to the North-west ol the town, close to the Wady al-Akik, lies the Mosque called Al-Kiblatayn—'The Two Directions of Prayer.' Some give this title to the Masjid al-Takwa at Kuba. Others assert that the Prophet, after visiting and eating (who had accompanied both flights, the greater and the lesser) here died of a wound received at Ohod, and was buried in Shaw- wal, a.h. 3, one month after Osman bin Maz'un. Abdullah bin Mas'ud, who, according to others, is buried at Kufah. Sa'ad ibn Zararah, interred near Osman bin Maz'un. Sa'ad bin Ma'az, who was buried by the Prophet. He died o a wound received during the battle of the Moat. Abd al-Rahman al-Ausat, son of Omar, the Caliph. He wa generally known as Abu Shahmah, the 'Father of Fat' : he sicken® and died, after receiving from his father the religious flogging- impudicitia causd. Abu Sufiyan bin al-Haris, grandson of Abd al-Muttalib. Hf was buried near Abdullah bin Ja'afar al-Tayyar, popularly knowi as the 'most generous of the Arabs,' and near Ukayl bin Ab Talib, the brother of Ali mentioned above. These are the principal names mentioned by popular authors The curious reader will find in old histories a multitude of others whose graves are now utterly forgotten at Al-Madinah. i See chapter xix. \XXII.—A Visit to the Saints' Cemetery. 45 at the house of an old woman named Umm Mabshar, went to pray the mid-day prayer in the Mosque of the Benu Salmah. He had performed the prostration with his face towards Jerusalem, when suddenly warned by revelation he turned Southwards and concluded his orisons in that direction. 1 I am told it is a mean dome without inner walls, outer enclosures, or minaret. The Masjid Benu Zafar (some write the word Tifr) is also called Masjid al-Baghlah—of the She-mule,— because, according to Al-Matari, on the ridge of stone to the south of this Mosque are the marks where the Prophet leaned his arm, and where the she-mule, Duldul, sent by the Mukaukas as a present with Mariyah the Coptic girl and Yafur the donkey, placed its hoofs. At the Mosque was shown a slab upon which the Prophet sat hearing recitations from the Koran ; and historians declare that by following his example many women have been blessed with offspring. 2 This Mosque is to the East of Al-Bakia. The Masjid al-Jumah—of Friday,—or Al-Anikah—of the Sand-heaps,—is in the valley near Kuba, where Mohammed prayed and preached on the first Friday after his flight from Meccah. 8 The Masjid al-Fazikh—of Date-liquor—is so called because when Abu Ayyub and others of the Ansar were sitting with cups in their hands, they heard that intoxi- 1 The story is related in another way. Whilst Mohammed was praying the Asr or afternoon prayer at the Harim he turned his face towards Meccah. Some of the Companions ran instantly to all the Mosques, informing the people of the change. In many places they were not listened to, but the Benu Salmah who were at prayer in stantly faced Southwards. To commemorate their obedience the Mosque was called Al-Kiblatayn. 2 I cannot say whether this valuable stone be still at the Mosque V Benu Tifr. But I perfectly remember that my friend Larking had a mutilated sphynx in his garden at Alexandria, which was found equally efficacious. 3 See chapter xvii.46 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. eating draughts were for the future forbidden, upon which Ibr they poured the liquor upon the ground. Here the in 1 Prophet prayed six days whilst he was engaged in war- Ma ring down the Benu Nazir Jews. The Mosque derives its zah other name, Al-Shams—of the Sun—because, being erected on rising ground East of and near Kuba, it re- call ceives the first rays of morning light. low To the Eastward of the Masjid al-Fazikh lies the per Masjid al-Kurayzah, erected on a spot where the Prophet to t descended to attack the Jewish tribe of that name.

The Prophet's prayer bein{ having here been granted, it is supposed by ardent Wes Moslems that no petition put up at the Mosque Al-Ahzab is gr is ever neglected by Allah. The form of supplication is Hari differently quoted by different authors. W hen Al-Shafe i was in trouble and fear of Harun al-Rashid, by the virtue domf of this formula he escaped all danger : I would willingly Hen offer so valuable a prophylactory to my readers, only it up, t is of an unmanageable length. The doctors of Al-Islam occa: also greatly differ about the spot where the Prophet stood pilgr on this occasion ; most of them support the claims of the a K j Masjid al-Fath, the most elevated of the four, to that Hajj distinction. Below, and to the South of the highest foun( ground, is the Masjid Salman al-Farsi, the Persian, from whose brain emanated the bright idea of the Moat. At Itisi the mature age of two hundred and fifty, some say three here hundred and fifty, after spending his life in search of Islar a religion, from a Magus (fire-worshipper) 1 becoming sue- recei cessively a Jew and a Nazarene, he ended with being a Masj Moslem, and a Companion of Mohammed. During his eventful career he had been ten times sold into slavery, hut t Below Salman's Mosque is the Masjid AH, and the by n smallest building on the South of the hill is called Masjid appe Abu Bakr. All these places owe their existence to Al- Hari Walid the Caliph : they were repaired at times by his Suki successors. The Masjid al-Rayah—of the Banner—was origin- ally built by Al-Walid upon a place where the Prophet there pitched his tent during the War of the Moat. Others I call it Al-Zubab, after a hill upon which it stands. Al- c hapt Rayah is separated from the Masjid al-Fath by a rising ground called Jabal Sula or Jabal Sawab 2 : the former 1 A magus, a magician, one supposed to worship fire.

The Damascus Caravan was to set out on the 27th Zu'l Ka'adah (1st September). I had intended to stay at Al-Madinah till the last moment, and to accompany the Kafilat al-Tayyarah, or the ' Flying Caravan,' which usually leaves on the 2nd Zu'l Hijjah, two days after that of Damascus. Suddenly arose the rumour that there would be no Tayyarah, 1 and that all pilgrims must proceed with the Damascus Caravan or await the Rakb. This is a Dromedary Caravan, in which each person carries only his saddle-bags. It usually descends by the road called Al-Khabt, and makes Meccah on the fifth day. The Sharif Zayd, Sa'ad the Robber's only friend, had paid him an unsuccessful visit. Schinderhans demanded back his Shaykh-ship, in return for a safe-conduct through his country: ' Otherwise,' said he, ' I will cut the throat oi every hen that ventures into the passes.' The Sharif Zayd returned to Al-Madinah on the 25th Zu'l Ka'adah (30th August). Early on the morning of the next day, Shaykh Hamid returned hurriedly from the bazar, exclaiming, ' You must make ready at once, Effendi!—there will be no Tayyarah—all Hajis start to-morrow—Allah will make it easy to you !—have you 1 The 'Tayyarah,' or 'Flying Caravan,' is lightly laden, and travels by forced marches.XXIII.—Tht Damascus Caravan. 5i your water-skins in order ?—you are to travel down the Darb al-Sharki, where you will not see water for three days!' Poor Hamid looked horrorstruck as he concluded this fearful announcement, which filled me with joy. Burck- hardt had visited and had described the Darb al-Sultani, the road along the coast. But no European had as yet travelled down by Harun al-Rashid's and the Lady Zubaydah's celebrated route through the Nijd Desert. Not a moment, however, was to be lost: we expected to start early the next morning. The boy Mohammed went forth, and bought for eighty piastres a Shugduf, which lasted us throughout the pilgrimage, and for fifteen piastres a Shibriyah or cot to be occupied by Shaykh Nur, who did not relish sleeping on boxes. The youth was employed all day, with sleeves tucked up, and work ing like a porter, in covering the litter with matting and rugs, in mending broken parts, and in providing it with large pockets for provisions inside and outside, with pouches to contain the gugglets of cooled water. Meanwhile Shaykh Nur and I, having inspected the water-skins, found that the rats had made considerable rents in two of them. There being no workman pro curable at this time for gold, I sat down to patch the damaged articles; whilst Nur was sent to lay in supplies for fourteen days. The journey is calculated at eleven days; but provisions are apt to spoil, and the Badawi camel-men expect to be fed. Besides which, pilferers abound. By my companion's advice I took wheat-flour, nee, turmeric, onions, dates, unleavened bread of two kinds, cheese, limes, tobacco, sugar, tea and coffee. Hamid himself started upon the most important part of our business. Faithful camel-men are required upon a road where robberies are frequent and stabbings occa sional, and where there is no law to prevent desertion or to limit new and exorbitant demands. After a time he52 Pilgrimage fo Al-Madinah and Meccah. returned, accompanied by a boy and a Badawi, a short, Sha thin, well-built old man with regular features, a white witl beard, and a cool clear eye; his limbs, as usual, were fron scarred with wounds. Mas'ud of the Rahlah, a sub- cret family of the Hamidah family of the Benu-Harb, came in with a dignified demeanour, applied his dexter palm to old ours, 1 sat down, declined a pipe, accepted coffee, and claii after drinking it, looked at us to show that he was ready the for negociation. We opened the proceedings with ' We nop want men, and not camels,' and the conversation pro- of ] ceeded in the purest Hijazi. 2 After much discussion, we him agreed, if compelled to travel by the Darb al-Sharki, to dep; pay twenty dollars for two camels, 8 and to advance Arbun, roor or earnest-money, to half that amount. 4 The Shaykh bound had himself to provide us with good animals, which, moreover, roor were to be changed in case of accidents: he was also to supply his beasts with water, and to accompany us to shoe Arafat and back. But, absolutely refusing to carry my nev( large chest, he declared that the tent under the Shugduf han( was burden enough for one camel; and that the green mig box of drugs, the sadciJe-bags, and the provision-sacks, ! surmounted by Nur's cot, were amply sufficient for the inglj other. On our part, we bound ourselves to feed the P art! —! — of tt 1 This ' Musafahah,' as it is called, is the Arab fashion of shak- cpj^ ing hands.

In the afternoon, Omar Effendi and others dropped in C Q n to take leave. They found me in the midst of prepara- ^i 0 ] tions, sewing sacks, fitting up a pipe, patching water-bags, rem and packing medicines. My fellow-traveller had brought a w me some pencils 1 and a penknife, as 'forget-me-nots,' for we were by no means sure of meeting again. He hinted, H a j however, at another escape from the paternal abode, and tati( proposed, if [possible, to join the Dromedary-Caravan. we Shaykh Hamid said the same, but I saw, by the expres- agai sion of his face, that his mother and wife would not give assi him leave from home so soon after his return. well Towards evening-time the Barr al-Manakhah became a scene of exceeding confusion. The town of tents lay and upon the ground. Camels were being laden, and were sup{ roaring under the weight of litters and cots, boxes and baggage. Horses and mules galloped about. Men were Alia rushing wildly in all directions on worldly errands, 01 to u hurrying to pay a farewell visit to the Prophet's Tomb He ( Women and children sat screaming on the ground, or rar plac to and fro distracted, or called their vehicles to escapf and the danger of being crushed. Every now and then &lt; our random shot excited all into the belief that the departure our gun had sounded. At times we heard a volley from th( sum robbers' hills, which elicited a general groan, for the pil bear grims were still, to use their own phrase, ' between feai righi When describing the Badawirf of Al-Hijaz, I shall have occasion tc notice their peculiar notions of the Salt-law. j i The import of such articles shows the march of progress in Al accor Hijaz, During the last generation, schoolmasters used for pencil ( } ou j )| bits of bar lead beaten to a point.XXIII.—The Damascus Caravan. 55 and hope,' and, consequently, still far from ' one of the two comforts. 1 ' Then would sound the loud ' Jhin-Jhin' of the camels bells, as the stately animals paced away with some grandee's gilt and emblazoned litter, the sharp plaint of the dromedary, and the loud neighing of excited steeds. About an hour after sunset all our preparations were concluded, save only the Shugduf, at which the boy Mohammed still worked with untiring zeal; he wisely remembered that he had to spend in it the best portion of a week and a half. The evening was hot, we therefore dined outside the house. I was told to repair to the Harim for the Ziyarat al-Wida'a, or the ' Farewell Visi tation '; but my decided objection to this step was that we were all to part,—how soon!—and when to meet again we knew not. My companions smiled consent, assuring me that the ceremony could be performed as 'well at a distance as in the temple. I hen Shaykh Hamid made me pray a two-bow prayer, and afterwards, facing towards the Harim, to recite this supplication with raised hands : a 11 u ^ ^P os ^ e we beg Thee to entreat Almighty Allah that He cut off no Portion of the Good resulting to us, from this Visit to Thee and to Thy Harim !

I raise to Thee, O Lord, Lord of Glory, greater than Man can describe! and Peace be upon the Apostle, and Laud to Allah, the Lord of the (three) Worlds.' This concludes, as usual, with the Testification and the Fatihah. Pious men on such an occasion go to the Rauzah, where they strive, if possible, to shed a tear,—a single drop being a sign of acceptance,—give alms to the utmost of their ability, vow piety, repentance, and obedience, and retire overwhelmed with grief, at separating themselves from their Prophet and Intercessor. It is customary, too, before leaving Al-Madinah, to pass at least one night in vigils at the Harim, and for learned men to read through the Koran once before the tomb. Then began the uncomfortable process of paying of little bills. The Eastern creditor always, for diven reasons, waits the last moment before he claims his debt Shaykh Hamid had frequently hinted at his difficulties the only means of escape from which, he said, was to rel) upon Allah. He had treated me so hospitably, that could not take back any part of the £$ lent to him a Suez. His three brothers received a dollar or two each and one or two of his cousins hinted to some effect tha such a proceeding would meet with their approbation. The luggage was then carried down, and disposed « packs upon the ground before the house, so as to be read; for loading at a moment's notice. Many flying parties c travellers had almost started on the high road, and lat in the evening came a new report that the body of th Caravan would march about midnight. We sat up til about two a.m ., when, having heard no gun, and havini seen no camels, we lay down to sleep through the sultr remnant of the hours of darkness.XXIII.—The Damascus Caravan. 57 Thus, gentle reader, was spent my last night at Al- Madinah. I had reason to congratulate myself upon having passed through the first danger. Meccah is so near the coast, that, in case of detection, the traveller might escape in a few hours to Jeddah, where he would find an English Vice-Consul, protection from the Turkish authorities, and possibly a British cruiser in the harbour. But at Al- Madinah discovery would entail more serious conse quences. The next risk to be run was the journey between the two cities, where it would be easy for the local officials quietly to dispose of a suspected person by giving a dollar to a Badawi.(3ist Ham in ho comp age, v as it 1 an \i[ were CHAPTER XXIV.

Pie was ac companied by his son, a bold boy about fourteen years of age, who fought sturdily about the weight of each package as it was thrown over the camel's back ; and his nephew, an ugly pock-marked lad, too lazy even to quarrel. We were ordered to lose no time in loading ; all started into activity, and at nine a.m. I found myself standing opposite the Egyptian Gate, surrounded by my friends, who had accompanied me thus far on foot, to take leave with due The ^ ono ur. After affectionate embraces and parting me- 3 line me ntoes, we mounted, the boy Mohammed and I in the ribed litter &gt; and Shaykh Nur in his cot.

Terrible earthquake, ^ accompanied by a thundering noise, shook the town ; from fourtee to eighteen were observed each night. On the third of Jamac one ' al-Akhir, after the Isha prayers, a fire burst out in the dim ^ out tion of Al-Hijaz (eastward); it resembled a vast city with a tu ^ j nn retted and battlemental fort, in which men appeared drawin e the flame about, as it were, whilst it roared, burned, and meltt 'pj lurs ^ like a sea everything that came in its way. Presently red and bluis ^ streams, bursting from it, ran close to Al-Madinah; and, at the sarn curren) time, the city was fanned by a cooling zephyr from the same dire ^ ^ ^ tion.

Si aspect of the country was volcanic, abounding in basalts and scoriae, more or less porous : sand veiled the black bed whose present dimensions by no means equal the descrip tions of Arabian historians. I made diligent enquiries about the existence of active volcanoes in this part of Al- Hijaz, and heard of none. At five p.m ., travelling towards the East, we entered a Bughaz, 1 or Pass, which follows the course of a wide Fiumara, walled in by steep and barren hills,—the portals of a region too wild even for Badawin. The torrent-bed narrowed where the turns were abrupt, and the drift of h eavy stones, with a water-mark from s ix to seven feet nine feet.

This is an object of some import- clas ance, as, during the whole journey, marching order must spre not be broken. We met with a host of minor accidents, load camels falling, Shugdufs bumping against one another, and plentiful abuse. Pertinaciously we hurried on till M six a.m., at which hour we emerged from the Black Pass. JL The large crimson sun rose upon us, disclosing, through Jzj purple mists, a hollow of coarse yellow gravel, based upon a hard whitish clay. About five miles broad by ^3 twelve long, it collects the waters of the high grounds \ after rain, and distributes the surplus through an exit towards the North-west, a gap in the low undulating hills Th, around. Entering it, we dismounted, prayed, broke oil neig fast, and after half an hour's halt proceeded to cross its breadth.

Respectable men, especially Arabs, were mounted on dromedaries, and the soldiers had horses: a led animal was saddled for every grandee, ready whenever he might wish to leave his litter. 'Women, children, and invalids of the poorer classes sat upon a 'Haml Musattah,'—rugs and cloths spread over the two large boxes which form the camel's load. 1 JVIany occupied Shibriyahs; a few, Shugdufs, and only the wealthy and the noble rode in Takht-rawan (litters), carried by camels or mules. 2 The morning beams fell brightly upon the glancing arms which surrounded the stripped Mahmil, 3 and upon the scarlet and gilt conveyances of the grandees.

They are no onger placed, as Abd al-Karim relates, in the rear ot the Caravan or post of danger. 1 Lane has accurately described this article; in the Hijaz it is sometimes made to resemble a little tent. 2 The vehicle mainly regulates the expense, as it evidences a an s means.

He was in his glory. There were many Meccans in the Caravan, among them his elder brother and several friends: the Sharif Zayd had sent, he said, to ask why he did not travel with his com patriots. That evening he drank so copiously of clarified butter, and ate dates mashed with flour and other abomi- nations to such an extent, that at night he prepared to give up the ghost. We passed a pleasant hour or two before sleeping. I began to like the old Shaykh Mas'ud, who, seeing it, entertained me with his genealogy, his battles, and his family affairs. The rest of the party could not prevent expressing contempt when they heard me putting frequent questions about torrents, hills, Badawin, and the direc- tions of places. 'Let the Father of Moustachios ask and learn,' said the old man; 'he is friendly with the Badawin, 1 and knows better than you all.' This reproof was intended to be bitter as the poet's satire, ' All fools have still an itching to deride, And fain would be upon the laughing side.' It called forth, however, another burst of merriment, for the jeerers remembered my nickname to have belonged to that pestilent heretic, Sa'ud the Wahhabi. On Saturday, the 3rd September, the hateful signal- gun awoke us at one a.m. In Arab travel there is nothing more disagreeable than the Sariyah or night-march, and yet the people are inexorable about it.

The day-sleep, too, is a kind of lethargy, and it is all but impossible to preserve an appetite during the hours of heat. At half-past five a.m ., after drowsily stumbling through hours of outer gloom, we entered a spacious basin at least six miles broad, and limited by a circlet of low hill. It was overgrown with camel-grass and Acacia (Shittim) trees, mere vegetable mummies; in many places the water had left a mark; and here and there the ground was pitted with mud-flakes, the remains of recently dried pools. After an hour's rapid march we toiled over a rugged ridge, composed of broken and detached blocks of basalt and scoriae, fantastically piled together, and dotted with thorny trees. Shaykh Mas'ud passed the time in walking to and fro along his line of camels, addressing us with a Khallikum guddam, 'to the front (of the litter)!' as we ascended, and a Khallikum wara, 'to the rear!' during the descent. It was wonderful to see the animals step ping from block to block with the sagacity of moun taineers; assuring themselves of their forefeet before trusting all their weight to advance. Not a camel fell, either here or on any other ridge: they moaned, however, piteously, for the sudden turns of the path puzzled them; the ascents were painful, the descents were still more so; the rocks were sharp; deep holes yawned between the blocks, and occasionally an Acacia caught the Shugduf, almost overthrowing the hapless bearer by the suddenness and the tenacity of its clutch. This passage took place during daylight. But we had many at night, which I shall neither forget nor describe. Descending the ridge, we entered another hill-encircled basin of gravel and clay. In many places basalt in piles and crumbling strata of hornblende schiste, disposed edge ways, green within, and without blackened by sun and rain, cropped out of the ground. At half-past ten weXXIV. — From Al-Madinah to Al-Snwayrkiyah. 6g found ourselves in an 'Acacia-barren,' one of the things which pilgrims dread. Here Shugdufs are bodily pulled off the camel's back and broken upon the hard ground; the animals drop upon their knees, the whole line is de ranged, and every one, losing temper, attacks his Moslem brother. The road was'flanked on the left by an iron wall of black basalt. Noon brought us to another ridge, whence we descended into a second wooded basin sur rounded by hills. Here the air was filled with those pillars of sand so graphically described by Abyssinian Bruce. They scudded on the wings of the whirlwind over the plain,—huge yellow shafts, with lofty heads, horizontally bent backwards, in the form of clouds; and on more than one occasion camels were thrown down by them. It required little stretch of fancy to enter into the Arabs' superstition. These sand- columns are supposed to be Jinnis of the Waste, which cannot be caught, a notion arising from the fitful move ments of the electrical wind-eddy that raises them, and as they advance, the pious Moslem stretches out his finger, exclaiming, 'Iron! O thou ill-omened one 1 !' During the forenoon we were troubled by the Samum, which, instead of promoting perspiration, chokes up and hardens the skin. The Arabs complain greatly of its vio lence on this line of road. Here I first remarked the dif ficulty with which the BadaAvin bear thirst. Ya Latif, 0 Merciful!' (Lord),—they exclaimed at times; and yet the y behaved like men. 2 I had ordered them to place the 1 Even Europeans, in popular parlance, call them 'devils.' 2 The Eastern Arabs allay the torments of thirst by a spoonful of clarified butter, carried on journeys in a leathern bottle. Every European traveller has some recipe of his own. One chews a musket-bullet or a small stone. A second smears his legs with butter. ^ nother eats a crust of dry bread, which exacerbates the torments, and afterwards brings relief. A fourth throws water over his face and an s or his legs and feet; a fifth smokes, and a sixth turns his dorsal region (raising his coat-tail) to the fire. I have always foundyo Pilgrimage to Al-Mcidificih and Mcccnh. water-camel in front, so as to exercise due supervision. Shaykh Mas'ud and his son made only an occasional refer ence to the skins. But his nephew, a short, thin, pock marked lad of eighteen, whose black skin and woolly head suggested the idea of a semi-African and ignoble origin, was always drinking; except when he climbed the camel s back, and, dozing upon the damp load, forgot his thirst. In vain we ordered, we taunted, and we abused him; he would drink, he would sleep, but he would not work. At one p.m. we crossed a Fiumara; and an hour afterwards we pursued the course of a second. Mas ud called this the Wady al-Khunak, and assured me that it runs from the East and the South-east in a North and North-west direction, to the Madinah plain. Early in the afternoon we reached a diminutive flat, on the Fiumara bank. Beyond it lies a Mahjar or stony ground, black as usual in Al-Hijaz, and over its length lay the road, white with dust and with the sand deposited by the camels' feet. Having arrived before the Pasha, we did not know where to pitch; many opining that the Caravan would traverse the Mahjar and halt beyond it. We soon alighted, however, pitched the tent under a burning sun, and were imitated by the rest of the party. Mas'ud called the place Hijriyah. According to my computation, it is twenty-five miles from Ghurab, and its direction is South-East twenty-two degrees. Late in the afternoon the boy Mohammed started with a dromedary to procure water from the higher part of the Fiumara. Here are some wells, still called Bir' Harun, after the great Caliph. The youth returned soon with two bags filled at an expense of nine piastres. This being the 28th Zu'l Ka'adah, many pilgrims busied them- that the only remedy is to be patient and not to talk. The more you drink, the more you require to drink—water or strong waters.

They failed; but we were consoled by seeing through a gap in the Western hills a heavy cloud discharge its blessed load, and a cool night was the result. We loitered on Sunday, the 4th September, at Al- Plijriyah, although the Shaykh forewarned us of a long march. But there is a kind of discipline in these great Caravans. A gun 1 sounds the order to strike the tents, and a second bids you move off with all speed. There are short halts, of half an hour each, at dawn, noon, the afternoon, and sunset, for devotional purposes, and these are regulated by a cannon or a culverin. At such times the Syrian and Persian servants, who are admirably expert in their calling, pitch the large green tents, with gilt crescents, for the dignitaries and their harims. The last resting-place is known by the hurrying forward of these 'Farrash,' or tent 'Lascars,' who are deter mined to be the first on the ground and at the well. A discharge of three guns denotes the station, and when the Caravan moves by night a single cannon sounds three or four halts at irregular intervals. The principal officers were the Emir Hajj, one Ashgar Ali Pasha, a veteran of whom my companions spoke slightingly, because he had been the slave of a slave, probably the pipe-bearer of some grandee who in his youth had been pipe-bearer to some other grandee. Under him was a Wakil, or lieu tenant, who managed the executive. The Emir al- Surrah—called simply Al-Surrah, or the Purse—had charge of the Caravan-treasure, and of remittances to the Holy Cities. And lastly there was a commander of the 1 We carried two small brass guns, which, on the line of march, were dismounted and placed upon camels. At the halt they were restored to their carriages. The Badawin think much of these harm- less articles, to which I have seen a gunner apply a match thrice before he could induce a discharge. In a 'moral' point of view, therefore, they are far more valuable than our twelve-pounders.72 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. forces (Bashat al-Askar): his host consisted of about a mac thousand Irregular horsemen, Bash-Buzuks, half bandits, dror half soldiers, each habited and armed after his oun in s fashion, exceedingly dirty, picturesque-looking, bra\e, and sucl in such a country of no use whatever. had Leaving Al-Hijriyah at seven a.m ., we passed over plac the grim stone-field by a detestable footpath, and at nine mad o'clock struck into a broad Fiumara, which runs from the how East towards the North-West. Its sandy bed is over grown with Acacia, the Senna plant, different species of gent Euphorbise, the wild Capparis, and the Daum Palm. Up low this line we travelled the whole day. About six p.m ., we larl} came upon a basin at least twelve miles broad, which Fiui absorbs the water of the adjacent hills. Accustomed as basi: I have been to mirage, a long thin line of salt efflorescence ston appearing at some distance on the plain below us, when heig the shades of evening invested the view, completely they deceived me. Even the Arabs were divided in opinion, kiya some thinking it was the effects of the rain which fell the Suw day before ; others were more acute. It is said that ' Gl beasts are never deceived by the mirage, and this, as far beyo as my experience goes, is correct. May not the reason be cour that most of them know the vicinity of water rather by gene smell than by sight ? Upon the horizon beyond the plain AA/es rose dark, fort-like masses of rock which I mistook for good buildings, the more readily as the Shaykh had warned me to ta: that we were approaching a populous place. At last the I descending a long steep hill, we entered upon the level has 1 ground, and discovered our error by the crunching sound the of the camel's feet upon large curling flakes of nitrous stron salt overlying caked mud. 1 Those civilised birds, the and kite and the crow, warned us that we were in the vicinity para] of man.

There were other obstacles, such as garden walls, wells, and hovels, so that midnight had sped before our weary camels reached the resting- place. A rumour that we were to halt here the next day, made us think lightly of present troubles ; it proved, however, to be false. During the last four days I attentively observed the general face of the country. This line is a succession of low plains and basins, here quasi-circular, there irregu larly oblong, surrounded by rolling hills and cut by Fiumaras which pass through the higher ground. The basins are divided by ridges and flats of basalt and green stone averaging from one hundred to two hundred feet in height. The general form is a huge prism ; sometimes they are table-topped. From Al-Madinah to Al-Suwayr- kiyah the low beds of sandy Fiumaras abound. From Al- Suwayrkiyah to Al-Zaribah, their place is taken by ' Ghadir,' or hollows in which water stagnates. And beyond Al-Zaribah the traveller enters a region of water courses tending West and South-West. The versant is generally from the East and South-East towards the ^est and North-West. Water obtained by digging is good where rain is fresh in the Fiumaras ; saltish, so as to taste at first unnaturally sweet, in the plains; and bitter in the basins and lowlands where nitre effloresces and rain has had time to become tainted. The landward faces of t e hills are disposed at a sloping angle, contrasting strongly with the perpendicularity of their seaward sides, and I found no inner range corresponding with, and parallel to, the maritime chain. Nowhere had I seen a an in which Earth s anatomy lies so barren, or one ri cher m volcanic and primary for mations. 1 Especially to -Ro^K 1115 b r Ut little read in geology.

The pre dominant formation was basalt, called the Arabs' Hajar Jahannam, or Hell-stone ; here and there it is porous and cellular ; in some places compact and black ; and in others coarse and gritty, of a tarry colour, and when fractured shining with bright points. Hornblende is com mon at Al-Madinah and throughout this part of Al-Hijaz: it crops out of the ground edgeways, black and brittle. Greenstone, diorite, and actinolite are found, though not so abundantly as those above mentioned. The granites, called in Arabic Suwan, 1 abound. Some are large-grained, of a pink colour, and appear in blocks, which, flaking off under the influence of the atmosphere, form ooidal blocks and boulders piled in irregular heaps. Others are grey and compact enough to take a high polish when cut. The syenite is generally coarse, although there is occasionally found a rich red variety of that stone. I did not see eurite or euritic porphyry except in small pieces, and the same may be said of the petrosilex and the milky and waxy quartz. 2 In some parts, particularly between Yambu' and Al-Madinah, there is an abundance of tawny Dr. Carter, Secretary to the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. His name is a guarantee of accuracy.

There is also a small admixture of the greenish sandstone which abounds at Aden. The secondary formation is repre sented by a fine limestone, in some places almost fit for the purposes of lithography, and a coarse gypsum often of a tufaceous nature.

Dr. Aloys Sprenger (Life of Mohammed, p. 18), throws 2 philosophic doubt upon the Ishmaelitish descent of Mohammed, who and i in personal appearance was a pure Caucasian, without any mingling irreg of Egyptian blood. And the Ishmaelitish origin of the whole Arab slend race is an utterly untenable theory. Years ago, our great historian my r sensibly remarked that 'the name (Saracens), used by Ptolemy and office Pliny in a more confined, by Ammianus and Procopius in a larger Arab sense, has been derived ridiculously from Sarah the wife of Abraham.' r ema In Gibbon's observation, the erudite Interpreter of the One Primaeval Indig Language,—the acute bibliologist who metamorphoses the quail of races the wilderness into a 'ruddy goose,'—detects 'insidiousness' and may 'a spirit of restless and rancorous hostility' against revealed Arab: religion.

The principal advent are the Noachians, a great Chal- daean or Mesopo t amian tribe whic h entered Arabia about Foster gratuitously attacked Burckhardt, whose manes had long rested in the good-will of man.

The great Anzah and the Nijdi families are types of this race, which is purely Caucasian, and shows a highly nervous temperament, together with those signs of 'blood' which distinguish even the lower animals, the horse and the camel, the greyhound and the goat of Arabia. These advense would correspond with the Arab al-Mutarribah or Arabicized Arabs of the eastern historians. 1 The third family, an ancient and a noble race dating from a.c. 1900, and typified in history by Ishmael, still occupies the so-called Sinaitic Peninsula. These Arabs, however, do not, and never did, extend beyond the limits of the mountains, where, still dwelling in the presence of their brethren, they retain all the wild customs and the un tamable spirit of their forefathers. They are distinguished from the pure stock by an admixture of Egyptian blood, s 1 Of this Mesopotamian race there are now many local varieties. The subjects of the four Abyssinian and Christian sovereigns who succeeded Yusuf. the Jewish ' Lord of the Pit.' produced, in Al-Yaman, the modern 'Akhdam' or 'Serviles.' The 'Hujur' of Al-Yaman and Oman are a mixed race whose origin is still unknown. And to quote no more cases, the 'Ebna' mentioned by the Ibn Ishak were descended from the Persian soldiers ot Anushirwan, who expelled the Abyssinian invader. 2 That the Copts, or ancient Egyptians, were ' Half-caste Arabs, a mixed people like the Abyssinians, the Gallas, the Somal, and the Kafirs, an Arab graft upon an African stock, appears highly probable. Hence the old Nilotic race has been represented as woolly -headed and of negro feature. Thus Leo Africanus makes the Africans to be descendants of the Arabs. Hence the tradition that Egypt was peopled by ^Ethiopia, and has been gradually whitened by admixture of Persian and Median, Greek and Roman blood. Hence, too, the fancied connection of ^Ethiopia with Cush, Susiana, Khuzistan or the lands about the Tigris.

And Strabo maintains the people of Mauritania to be Indians vhoXXV.—The Badawin of Al-Hijaz. 79 rove and by preserving the ancient characteristics of the )pier Nilotic family.

I will not apologise for entering into details concern- ^ ing the personah of the Badawin 1 ; a precise physical por trait of race, it has justly been remarked, is the sole deficiency in the pages of Bruce and of Burckhardt. The temperament of the Hijazi is not unfrequently the pure nervous, as the height of the forehead and the fine texture of the hair prove. Sometimes the bilious, and rarely the sanguine, elements predominate; the lymph atic I never saw. He has large nervous centres, and well-formed spine and brain, a conformation favourable to longevity. Bartema well describes his colour as a ' dark leonine '; it varies from the deepest Spanish to a chocolate hue, and its varieties are attributed by the people to blood. The skin is hard, dry, and soon wrinkled by ex posure. The xanthous complexion is rare, though not unknown in cities, but the leucous does not exist. The crinal hair is frequently lightened by bleaching, and the pilar is browner than the crinal. The voice is strong and clear, but rather barytone than bass : in anger it be comes a shrill chattering like the cry of a wild animal. The look of a chief is dignified and grave even to pensive- ness; the 'respectable man's ' is self-sufficient and fierce; the lower orders look 'ferocious, stupid, and inquisitive. Yet there is not much difference in this point between men of the same tribe, who have similar pursuits which engen- springs from a morbid sense of honour, and arose, it is popularly said, from an affront taken by a Sharif against his daughter's hus band. But all Arabs condemn the practice. i I use this word as popular abuse has fixed it. Every Orientalist knows that Badawin (Bedouin) is the plural form of Badawi, an 'ism al-nisbah,' or adjective derived from Badu, a Desert. 'Some words notoriously corrupt,' says Gibbon, 'are fixed, and as it were natural ised, in the vulgar tongue.' The word 'Badawi' is not insulting, like 'Turk' applied to an Osmanli, or 'Fellah' to the Egyptian. But you affront the wild man by mistaking his clan for a lower one. ' Ya Hitaymi,' for instance, addressed to a Harb Badawi, makes him finger his dagger.To fact vol. ii. page 81. BADAWI AND WAHHABI* HEADS AND HEAD-DRESSES. i.

The Badawi of the Hijaz, and indeed the featui race generally, has a small eye, round, restless, deep-set, and fiery, denoting keen inspection with an ardent temper- short ament and an impassioned character.

This, combined with its fixity of glance, forms J an expression now of lively fierceness, then of exceeding height sternness ; whilst the narrow space between the orbits im- averaj presses the countenance in repose with an intelligence statur not destitute of cunning. As a general rule, however, the ever z expression of the Badawi face is rather dignity than that restrai cunning for which the Semitic race is celebrated, and throug there are lines about the mouth in variance with the stern square or the fierce look of the brow. The ears are like those of about Arab horses, small, well-cut, ' castey,' and elaborate, three with many elevations aud depressions. The nose is pro- is sine nounced, generally aquiline, but sometimes straight like in-dra^ those Greek statues which have been treated as prodigious especii exaggerations of the facial angle. For the most part,it early r is a well-made feature with delicate nostrils, below which iront £ the septum appears : in anger they swell and open like a muscle blood mare's.

The lips are either hordes, denoting rudeness and instrun want of taste, or they form a mere line.

Yet there is no slouch in his walk ; it is light and springy, and errs only in one point, sometimes becoming a strut * , , , 1. r Such is the Badawi, and such he has been for ages. The national type has been preserved by systematic intermarriage. The wild men do not refuse then daughters to a stranger, but the son-in-law would be forced to settle among them, and this life, which has its charms for a while, ends in becoming wearisome. Here no evil results are anticipated from the union of first cousins, and the experience of ages and of a mightj nation may be trusted. Every Badawi has a right tc marry his father's brother's daughter before she is gnat to a stranger; hence 'cousin' {Bint Amm) in poit; phrase signifies a ' wife. 1 ' Our physiologists 2 adduce thi Sangre Azul of Spain and the case of the lower animalst prove that de generacy inevitably follows ' breedin g-in^ * !

Secondly, there is the terrible jari of blood-feud, which even the most reckless fear for their render posterity. And, thirdly, though the revealed law of the les tie Koran, being insufficient for the Desert, is openly disre- start- garded, the immemorial customs of the Kazi al-Arab (the ut cut Judge of the Arabs) 1 form a system stringent in the ■ firing extreme. a'ab d- The valour of the Badawi is fitful and uncertain. ^ polite Man is by nature an animal of prey, educated by the com- 1, and, plicated relations of society, but readily relapsing into his drunk- old habits. Ravenous and sanguinary propensities grow tots by apace in the Desert, but for the same reason the reckless ness of civilisation is unknown there. Savages and semi- r noble barbarians are always cautious, because they have nothing srosity, valuable but their lives and limbs. The civilised man, on d great the contrary, has a hundred wants or hopes or aims, with- [ souls, out which existence has for him no charms. Arab ideas 1 grave of bravery do not prepossess us. Their romances, full of t wori, foolhardy feats and impossible exploits, might charm for a ul afa time, but would not become the standard works of a really 11-Haib fighting people. 2 Nor would a truly valorous race admire 1 Throughout the world the strictness of the Lex Scripta is in inverse ratio to that of custom; whenever the former is lax, the latter is stringent, and vice versd. Thus in England, where law leaves men comparatively free, they are slaves to a grinding despotism of conventionalities, unknown in the land of tyrannical rule. This explains why many men, accustomed to live under despotic govern ments, feel fettered and enslaved in the so-called free countries. Hence, also, the reason why notably in a republic there is less private and practical liberty than under a despotism. The 'Kazi al-Arab' (Judge of the Arabs) is in distinction to the Kazi al-Shara, or the Kazi of the Koran. The former is, almost always, some sharp- witted greybeard, with a minute knowledge of genealogy and precer dents, a retentive memory and an eloquent tongue. 2 Thus the Arabs, being decidedly a parsimonious people, indulge in exaggerated praises and instances of liberality. Hatim Tai, whose generosity is unintelligible to Europeans, becomes the Arab model of the ' open hand.' Generally a high beau ideal is no proof of a people's practical pre-eminence, and when exaggeration enters into it and modem rted tj if socitt ;rafties! gives a i derives lixture oi :e policy.

Arab wars, too, are a succession of skirmishes, in which five hundred men will retreat after losing a dozen of their number. In this partisan-fighting the first charge secures a victory, and the vanquished fly till covered by the shades of night. Then come cries and taunts of women, deep oaths, wild poetry, excitement, and reprisals, which will probably end in the flight of the former victor. When peace is to be made, both parties count up their dead, and the usual blood-money is paid for excess on either side. Generally, however, the feud endures till, all becoming weary of it, some great man, as the Sharif of Meccah, is called upon to settle the terms of a treaty, which is nothing but an armistice. After a few months' peace, a glance or a word will draw blood, for these hates are old growths, and new dissensions easily shoot up from them. But, contemptible though their battles be, the Bada- win are not cowards. The habit of danger in raids and blood-feuds, the continual uncertainty of existence, the desert, the chase, the hard life and exposure to the air, blunting the nervous system ; the presence and the practice of weapons, horsemanship, sharpshooting, and martial exercises, habituate them to look death in the face like men, and powerful motives will make them heroes. The English, it is said, fight willingly for lib erty, our neighbours for glory ; the Spaniard fights, or rather fought, for religion and the Pundonor; and the Irishman fights for the fun of fighting. Gain and revenge draw the Arab's sword ; yet then he uses it fitfully enough, without the gay gallantry of the suits the public taste, a low standard of actuality may be fairly suspected. But to convince the oriental mind you must dazzle it. Hence, in part, the superhuman courage of Antar, the liberality of Hatim, the justice of Omar, and the purity of Laila and Majnun under circumstances more trying than aught chronicled in Mathilde, or in the newest American novel.XXV.—The Badawin of Al-Hijaz. 89 French or the persistent stay of the Anglo-Saxon. To become desperate he mast have the all-powerful stimulants of honour and of fanaticism. Frenzied by the insults of his women, or by the fear of being branded as a coward, he is capable of any mad deed. 1 And the obstinacy produced by strong religious impressions gives a steadfastness to his spirit unknown to mere enthusiasm. The history of the Badawi tells this plainly. Some unobserving travellers, indeed, have mistaken his exceeding cautiousness for stark cowardice. The incongruity is easily read by one who understands the principles of Badawi warfare ; with them, as amongst the Red Indians, one death dims a victory. And though reckless when their passions are thoroughly aroused, though heedless of danger when the voice of honour calls them, the Badawin will not sacrifice them- selves for light motives. Besides, they have, as has been said, another and a potent incentive to cautiousness. Whenever peace is concluded, they must pay for victory. There are two things which tend to soften the ferocity of Badawi life. These are, in the first place, intercourse with citizens, who frequently visit and entrust their child ren to the people of the Black tents ; and, secondly, the social position of the women. The Rev. Charles Robertson, author of a certain 1 At the battle of Bissel, when Mohammed Ali of Egypt broke the 40.000 guerillas of Faisal son of Sa'ud the Wahhabi, whole lines of the Benu Asir tribe were found dead and tied by the legs with ropes. This system of colligation dates from old times in Arabia, as the *• Affair of Chains ' (Zat al-Salasil) proves. It is alluded to by the late Sir Henry Elliot in his ' Appendix to the Arabs in Sind.'—a work of remarkable sagacity and research. According to the ' Beglar- Nameh.' it was a 'custom of the people of Hind and Sind, when ever they devote themselves to death, to bind themselves to each other by their mantles and waistbands.' It seems to have been an ancient practice in the West as in the East; the Cimbri, to quote no other instances, were tied together with cords when attacked by i anus.

' Lecture on Poetry, addressed to Working Men,' asserts that Passion became Love under the influence of Christi anity, and that the idea of a Virgin Mother spread over the sex a sanctity unknown to the poetry or to the phil osophy of Greece and Rome. 1 Passing over the objections of deified Eros and Immortal Psyche, and of the Virgin Mother—symbol of moral purity—being common to every old and material faith, 2 1 believe that all the noble tribes of savages display the principle. Thus we might expect to find, wherever the fancy, the imagination, and the ideality are strong, some traces of a sentiment innate in the human organisation. It exists, says Mr. Catlin, amongst the North American Indians, and even the Gallas and the Somal of Africa are not wholly destitute of it. But when the barbarian becomes a semi-barbarian, as are the most polished Orientals, or as were the classical authors of Greece and Rome, then women fall from their proper place in society, become mere articles of luxury, and sink into the lowest moral condition. In the next stage, ' civilisa tion,' they rise again to be ' highly accomplished,' and not a little frivolous. 1 Though differing in opinion, upon one subject, from the Re7. Mr. Robertson, the lamented author of this little work, I cannot re frain from expressing the highest admiration of those noble thoughts, those exalted views, and those polished sentiments which, combining the delicacy of the present with the chivalry of a past age, appear in a style 'As smooth as woman and as strong as man.'

Human nature, all the world over, differs but s of in degree. Everywhere women may be ' capricious, coy, )lace and hard to please ' in common conjunctures : in the into hour of need they will display devoted heroism. Any ilisa- chronicler of the Afghan war will bear witness that warm and hearts, noble sentiments, and an overflowing kindness to the poor, the weak, and the unhappy are found even in a harim.

Whoever peruses the Suspended Poem of Labid, will find thoughts at once so plaintive and so noble, that even Dr. Carlyle's learned verse cannot wholly deface their charm. The warrior-bard returns from afar. He looks upon the traces of hearth and home still furrowing the Desert ground. In bitterness of spirit he checks himself from calling aloud upon his lovers and his friends. He melts at the remembrance of their departure, and long indulges in the absorbing theme. Then he strengthens himself by the thought of Nawara's inconstancy, how she left him and never thought of him again. He impatiently dwells upon the charms of the places which detain her, advocates flight from the changing lover and the false friend, and, in the exultation with which he feels his swift dromedary start under him upon her rapid course, he seems to seek and finds some consolation for women's perfidy and forgetfulness. Yet he cannot abandon Nawara's name or memory. Again he dwells with yearning upon scenes of past felicity, and he boasts of his prowess—a fresh reproach to her,—of his gentle birth, and of his hospitality. He ends with an encomium upon his clan, to which he attributes, as a noble Arab should, all the virtues of man. This is Goldsmith's deserted village in Al-Hijaz. But the Arab, with equal simplicity and pathos, has a fire, a force of language, and a depth of feeling, which the Irishman, admirable as his verse is, could never rival. As the author of the Peninsular War well remarks, women in troubled times, throwing off their accustomed feebleness and frivolity, become helpmates meet for man.

And even the French have of late made an inroad into Teutonic mysticism successfully enough to have astonished Racine and horrified La Harpe. 2 This, however, does not prevent the language becoming option ally most precise in meaning; hence its high philosophical character. The word 'farz,' for instance, means, radically 'cutting,' second arily ' ordering,' or ' paying a debt,' after which come numerous meanings foreign to the primal sense, such as a shield, part of a tinder-box, an unfeathered arrow, and a particular kind of date. In theology it is limited to a single signification, namely, a divine com mand revealed in the Koran. Under these circumstances the Arabic becomes, in grammar, logic, rhetoric, and mathematics, as perfect and precise as Greek. I have heard Europeans complain that it is unfit for mercantile transactions.—Perhaps 1XXV.—The Bad aw in of Al-Hijaz. 101 which might be prolonged indefinitely, there is in the Semitic dialect a copiousness of rhyme which leaves the poet almost unfettered to choose the desired expression. 1 Hence it is that a stranger speaking Ajrabic becomes poetical as naturally as he would be witty in French and philosophic in German. Truly spake Mohammed al- Damiri, ' Wisdom hath alighted upon three things—the brain of the Franks, the hands of the Chinese, and the tongues of the Arabs.' The name of Harami —brigand—is still honourable among the Hijazi Badawin. Slain in raid or foray, a man is said to die Ghandilr, or a brave. He, on the other hand, who is lucky enough, as we should express it, to die in his bed, is called Fatis (carrion, the corps creve of the Klephts); his weeping mother will exclaim, ' O that my son had perished of a cut throat!' and her attendant crones will suggest, with deference, that such evil came of the will of Allah. It is told of the Lahabah, a sept of the Auf near Rabigh, that a girl will refuse even her cousin unless, in the absence of other opportunities, he plunder some article from the Hajj Caravan in front of the Pasha's links. Detected twenty years ago, the delinquent would have been impaled ; now he escapes with a rib-roasting. Fear of the blood-feud, and the certainty of a shut road to future travellers, prevent the Turks proceeding to ex tremes. They conceal their weakness by pretending that i As a general rule there is a rhyme at the end of every second line, and the unison is a mere fringe—a long a, for instance, through out the poem sufficing for the delicate ear of the Arab. In this they were imitated by the old Spaniards, who. neglecting the consonants, merely required the terminating vowels to be alike. We speak of the sort of harmonious simple flow which atones for the imperfect nature of the rhyme.' But the fine organs of some races would be hurt by that ponderous unison which a people of blunter senses find necessary to produce an impression.

' My young ones play upon the of th backs of camels,' was the reply made to me by a Jahayni pracl Badawi when offered some Egyptian plaything. The men ingol pass their time principally in hawking, shooting, and Thei riding. The 'Sakr, 1 ' I am told, is the only falcon in pisto general use ; they train it to pursue the gazelle, which Jamh _ — u p i i Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall, in the ' Falkner-Klee,' calli xi i this bird the ' Saker-falke.' Hence the French and English names 6 sacre and saker. The learned John Beckmann (History of Inven- tions, Discoveries, and Origins: sub voce) derives falconry from India, span: where, ' as early as the time of Ctesias, hares and foxes were hunted sequf by means of rapacious birds.' I believe, however, that no trace d desce this sport is found in the writings of the Hindus. Beckmann agrees f with Giraldus, against other literati, that the ancient Greeks knew the y 0 ' 1 art of hawking, and proves from Aristotle, that in Thrace men trained t ' e c falcons. But Aristotle alludes to the use of the bird, as an owl is fr om employed in Italy: the falcon is described as frightening, not catch- and 1 ing the birds. CElian corroborates Aristotle's testimony. Pliny, baj- c however, distinctly asserts that the hawks strike their prey down. t 'In Italy it was very common,' says the learned Beckmann, 'for ^ Martial and Apuleius speak of it as a thing everywhere known. . n 8 Hence the science spread over Europe, and reached perfection at th?

The Persians claim the invention for their Just King, tt Anushirawan, contemporary with Mohammed. Thence the sport worth passed into Turkey, where it is said the Sultans maintained a body of ~ 6000 falconers. And Frederic Barbarossa, in the twelfth century, T , 1 , brought falcons to Italy.

On such occasions feastings and merrymakings take place, as at our christenings. Women being a marketable commodity in barbarism as in civilisation, the youth in Al-Hijaz is not married till his father can afford to buy him a bride. There is little pomp or ceremony save firing of guns, dancing, singing, and eating mutton. The ' settlement ' is usually about thirty sound Spanish dollars, 1 half paid down, and the other owed by the bridegroom to the father, the brothers, or the kindred of his spouse. Some tribes will take animals in lieu of ready money. A man of wrath not con tented with his bride, puts her away at once. If peaceably inclined, by a short delay he avoids scandal. Divorces are very frequent among Badawin, and if the settlement money be duly paid, no evil comes of them. 3 The funerals of the wild men resemble those of the citizens, only they are more simple, the dead being buried where they die.

This coin was doubtless preferred by the Badawin for its superiority to the currency of the day: they make from it ornaments for their women and decorations for their weapons. The generic term for dollars is ' Riyal Fransah.' 2 Torale, sicut est mos Judaicus et Persicus, non inspiciunt.

Sandals, too, are of every description, from the simple sole of leather tied on with thongs, to the handsome and elaborate chaussure of Meccah ; the price varies from a piastre to a dollar, and the very poor wall barefooted. A leathern bandoleer, called Majdal, passed over the left shoulder, and reaching to the right hip, sup ports a line of brass cylinders for cartridges. 1 The other cross-belt (Al-Masdar), made of leather ornamented with brass rings, hangs down at the left side, and carries a Kharizah, or hide-case for bullets. And finally, the Hiza^ or waist-belt, holds the dagger and extra cartridge cases, A Badawi never appears in public unarmed. Women wear, like their masters, dark blue cottoi Tobes, but larger and looser. When abroad they cover the head with a Yashmak of black stuff, or a poppy-coloured Burhd (nose-gay) of the Egyptian shape. They wear nc pantaloons, and they rarely affect slippers or sandals The hair is twisted into Majdul, little pig-tails, and copiously anointed with clarified butter. The rich pe: fume the skin with rose and cinnamon-scented oils, anc adorn the hair with Al-Shayh (Absinthium), sweetest her of the Desert; their ornaments are bracelets, collars, eai and nose-rings of gold, silver, or silver-gilt.

I never saw the man who could refrain from water upon the line of march; and in this point they contrast dis- advantageously with the hardy Wahhabis of the East, and the rugged mountaineers of Jabal Shammar. They are still ' acridophagi,' and even the citizens far prefer a dish of locusts to the Fasikh, which act as anchovies, sar dines, and herrings in Egypt. They light a fire at night, and as the insects fall dead they quote this couplet to justify their being eaten— 'We are allowed two carrions and two bloods, The fish and locust, the liver and the spleen. 1 Where they have no crops to lose, the people are thankful for a fall of locusts. In Al-Hijaz the flights are uncertain; during the last five years Al-Madinah has seen but few. They are prepared for eating by boiling in salt water and drying four or five days in the sun: a 'wet' locust to an Arab is as a snail to a Briton. The head is plucked off, the stomach drawn, the wings and the prickly part of the legs are plucked, and the insect is ready for the table. Locusts are never eaten with sweet things, which would be nauseous: the dish is always ' hot,' with salt and pepper, or onions fried in clarified butter, when it tastes nearly as well as a plate of stale shrimps. The favourite food on the line of march is meat cut into strips and sun-dried. This, with a bag of milk-balls a W 1 ^ 1 ! ver and the s P leen are both supposed to be 'congealed blood.'

(Fie upon thee, drunkard!) is a popular phrase, preserving the memory of another state of things. Some clans, though not all, smoie tobacco. It is generally the growth of the country called Hijazi or Kazimiyah ; a green weed, very strong, with a foul smell, and costing about one piastre per pound. The Badawin do not relish Persian tobacco, and cannot pro cure Latakia: it is probably the pungency of the natne growth offending the delicate organs of the Desert-mea, that caused nicotiana to be proscribed by the Wahhabis, who revived against its origin a senseless and obsolete calumny. The almost absolute independence of the Arabs, and of that noble race the North American Indians of a former generation, has produced a similarity between them worthy of note, because it may warn the anthropologist not alwajs to detect in coincidence of custom identity of origii. Both have the same wild chivalry, the same fiery sense of honour, and the same boundless hospitality: elopements from tribe to tribe, the blood feud, and the Vendetta aie common to the two. Both are grave and cautious in demeanour, and formal in manner,—princes in rags cr paint. The Arabs plunder pilgrims ; the Indians, bancs of trappers ; both glory in forays, raids, and cattle-lifting; and both rob according to certain rules. Both are alter nately brave to desperation, and shy of danger. Both are remarkable for nervous and powerful eloquence; diy humour, satire, whimsical tales, frequent tropes; boasts, and ruffling style; pithy proverbs, extempore songs, and languages wondrous in their complexity. Both, recog nising no other occupation but war and the chase, despise artificers and the effeminate people of cities, as the game cock spurns the vulgar roosters of the poultry-yard. 1 The i Ihe North American trappers adopted this natural prejudice;XXV.—Tht Badawin of Al-Hijaz. ng chivalry of the Western wolds, like that of the Eastern wilds, salutes the visitor by a charge of cavalry, by dis charging guns, and by wheeling around him with shouts and yells. The 'brave' stamps a red hand upon his mouth to show that he has drunk the blood of a foe. Of the Utaybah 'Harami' it is similarly related, that after mortal combat he tastes the dead man's gore. Of these two chivalrous races of barbarians, the Badawi claims our preference on account of his treatment of women, his superior development of intellect, and the glorious page of history which he has filled. The tribes of Al-Hijaz are tediously numerous : it will be sufficient to enumerate the principal branches of the Badawi tree, without detailing the hundred little off shoots which it has put forth in the course of ages. 1 Those ancient clans the Abs and Adnan have almost died out. The latter, it is said, still exists in the neighbourhood of Taif; and the Abs, I am informed, are to be found near Kusayr (Cosseir), on the African coast, but not in Al-Hijaz. Of the Aus, Khazraj, and Nazir details have been given in a previous chapter. The Benu Harb is now the ruling clan in the Holy Land. It is di vided by genealogists into two great bodies, first, the Benu Salim, and, secondly, the Masruh, 2 or 'roaming tribes.' the 'free trapper' called his more civilized confrere, 'mangeur de lard.' 1 Burckhardt shrank from the intricate pedigree of the Meccan Sharifs. I have seen a work upon the subject in four folio volumes in point of matter equivalent to treble the number in Europe. The best known genealogical works are Al-Kalkashandi (originally in seventy-five books, extended to one hundred); the Umdat al-Tullab by Ibn Khaldun; the 'Tohfat al-Arab fi Ansar al-Arab,' a well- known volume by Al-Siyuti; and, lastly, the Sirat al-Halabi, in six volumes 8vo. Of the latter work there is an abridgment by Moham med al-Banna al-Dimyati in two volumes 8vo.; but both are rare, and consequently expensive. 2 I give the following details of the Harb upon the authority of my friend Omar Effendi, who is great in matters of genealogy.XXV.—The Bad a win of Al-Hijaz. 123 13.

We have now left the territory of Al-Madinah. Al- SuAvayrkiyah, which belongs to the Sharif of Meccah, is about twenty-eight miles distant from Hijriyah, and by dead reckoning ninety-nine miles along the road from the Prophet's burial-place. Its bearing from the last station was S. W. 11 0 . The town, consisting of about one hundred houses, is built at the base and on the sides of a basaltic mass, which rises abruptly from the hard clayey plain. The summit is converted into a rude fortalice— without one, no settlement can exist in Al -Hijaz—by a bulwark of uncut stone, piled up so as to make a parapet. The lower part of the town is protected by a mud wall, with the usual semicircular towers. Inside there is a bazar, well supplied with meat (principally mutton) by the neighbouring Badawin; and wheat, barley, and dates are grown near the town. There is little to describe in the narrow streets and the mud houses, which are essentially Arab. The fields around are divided into little square plots by earthen ridges and stone walls; some of the palms are fine-grown trees, and the wells appear numerous. The water is near the surface and plentiful, but it has a brackish taste, highly disagreeable after a few days' use, and the effects are the reverse of chalybeate. The town belongs to the Benu Hosayn, a race ofXXVI.—From Al-Suwayrhiyah to Meccah. 125 schismatics mentioned in the foregoing pages. They claim the allegiance of the Badawi tribes around, princi pally Mutayr, and I was informed that their fealty to the Prince of Meccah is merely nominal. The morning after our arrival at Al-Suwayrkiyah witnessed a commotion in our little party: hitherto they had kept together in fear of the road. Among the number was one AH bin Ya Sin, a perfect 'old man of the sea.' By profession he was a ' Zemzemi,' or dis penser of water from the Holy Well, 1 and he had a hand some 'palazzo' at the foot of Abu Kubays in Meccah, which he periodically converted into a boarding-house. Though past sixty, very decrepit, bent by age, white- bearded, and toothless, he still acted cicerone to pilgrims, and for that purpose travelled once every year to Al- Madinah. These trips had given him the cunning of a veteran voyageur. He lived well and cheaply; his home-made Shugduf, the model of comfort, was garnished with soft cushions and pillows, whilst from the pockets protruded select bottles of pickled limes and similar luxuries ; he had his travelling Shishah (water-pipe), 4 and at the halting-place, disdaining the crowded, reeking tent, he had a contrivance for converting his vehicle into a habitation. He was a type of the Arab old man. He mumbled all day and three-quarters of the night, for he had des insomnies. His nerves were so fine, that if any 1 There are certain officers called Zemzemi, who distribute the holy water. In the case of a respectable pilgrim they have a large jar of the shape described in Chap, iv., marked with his names and titles, and sent every morning to his lodgings. If he be generous, one or more will be placed in the Harim, that men may drink in his honour. The Zemzemi expects a present varying from five to eleven dollars. 2 The shishah, smoked on the camel, is a tin canister divided into two compartments, the lower half for the water, the upper one for the tobacco. The cover is pierced with holes to feed the fire, and a short hookah-snake projects from one side.126 Pilgrimage to Al-Madtnah and Meccah. one mounted his Shugduf, the unfortunate was condemned a w0 to lie like a statue. Fidgety and priggishly neat, nothing the p annoyed him so much as a moment's delay or an article Bada' out of place, a rag removed from his water-gugglet, or a the le cooking-pot imperfectly free from soot; and I judged his scran avarice by observing that he made a point of picking ui: sig^t and eating the grains scattered from om pomegranates hours exclaiming that the heavenly seed (located there by Aral had ] superstition) might be one of those so wantonly wasted. happi Ali bin Ya Sin, returning to his native city, had nol the li been happy in his choice ol a companion this time. Th{ ^ other occupant of the handsome Shugdut was an ignoble- minec faced Egyptian from Al-Madinah. This ill-suited pair and 1 clave together for awhile, but at Al-Suwayrkiyah some trave dispute about a copper coin made them permanent foes. Shay With threats and abuse such as none but an Egyptian marr&lt; could tamely hear, AH kicked his quondam friend out of scare the vehicle. But terrified, after reflection, by the possi- mine: bility that the man, now his enemy, might combine with two or three Syrians of our party to do him a harm, and a Sc frightened by a few black looks, the senior determined to thinl; fortify himself by a triend.

Shaykh Nur, elated by the r sight of old Ali's luxuries, promised himself some joyous tes hours ; but next morning he owned with a sigh that he ra t had purchased splendour at the extravagant price of 3. happiness—the senior's tongue never rested throughout n0 j the livelong night. Ph* During our half-halt at Al-Suwayrkiyah we deter- bl e . mined to have a small feast; we bought some fresh dates, 3 a i t and we paid a dollar and a half for a sheep. Hungry )me travellers consider ' liver and fry ' a dish to set before a 3eSi Shaykh. On this occasion, however, our enjoyment was ian marred by the water ; even Soyer's dinners would t 0 f scarcely charm if washed down with cups of a certain ggj. mineral-spring found at Epsom. nth We started at ten a.m. (Monday, 5th September) in arc l a South-Easterly direction, and travelled over a flat, \ t0 thinly dotted with Desert vegetation. At one p.m we b C y passed a basaltic ridge ; and then, entering a long de- : j on pressed line of country, a kind of valley, paced down it rec j five tedious hours. The Samum as usual was blowing g e( j hard, and it seemed to affect the travellers' tempers. In g 0 f one place I saw a Turk, who could not speak a word of Arabic, violently disputing with an Arab who could not an&gt; understand a word of Turkish. The pilgrim insisted . tcl upon adding to the camel's load a few dry sticks, such as ^ a( j are picked up for cooking. The camel-man as persever- aib- ingly threw off the extra burthen. They screamed with rage, ent hustled each other, and at last the Turk dealt the Arab a nel. heavy blow. I afterwards heard that the pilgrim was irin, mortally wou nded that night, his stomach being ripped dis- 1 The Hindustani ' sir.'

On enquiring what had become of him, I was assured that he had been comfortably wrapped up in his shroud, and placed in a half-dug grave. This is the general practice in the case of the poor and solitary, whom illness or accident incapacitates from proceeding, It is impossible to contemplate such a fate without horror: the torturing thirst of a wound, 1 the burning sun heatinj the brain to madness, and—worst of all, for they do no: wait till death—the attacks of the jackal, the vulture, ani the raven of the wild. At six p.m., before the light of day had faded, w« traversed a rough and troublesome ridge. Descending it our course lay in a southerly direction along a roac flanked on the left by low hills of red sandstone and brighi porphyry. About an hour afterwards we came to £ basalt field, through whose blocks we threaded our wa) painfully and slowly, for it was then dark. At eight p.m the camels began to stumble over the dwarf dykes of thf wheat and barley fields, and presently we arrived at oui halting-place, a large village called Al-Sufayna. Thf plain was already dotted with tents and lights. We found the Baghdad Caravan, whose route here falls into the Dart al-Sharki. It consists of a few Persians and Kurds, and collects the people of North-Eastern Arabia, Wahhabis and others. They are escorted by the Agayl tribe and b} the fierce mountaineers of Jabal Shammar. Scarcely was our tent pitched, when the distant pattering of musketr) and an ominous tapping of the kettle-drum sent all m) companions in diflerent directions to enquire what was the cause of quarrel. The Baghdad Cafilah, though nol more than 2000 in number, men, women and children, had been proving to the Damascus Caravan, that, being per fectly ready to fight, they were not going to yield anj point of precedence. From that time the two bodies 1 When Indians would say ' he was killed upon the spot,' they use the picturesque phrase, 'he asked not for water.'9 XXVI.—From Al-Suwayrhiyah to Meccah. 129 encamped in different places. I never saw a more pug nacious assembly : a look sufficed for a quarrel. Once a Wahhabi stood in front of us, and by pointing with his finger and other insulting gestures, showed his hatred to the chibuk, in which I was peaceably indulging. It was impossible to refrain from chastising his insolence by a polite and smiling offer of the offending pipe. This made him draw his dagger without a thought; but it was sheathed again, for we all cocked our pistols, and these gentry prefer steel to lead. We had travelled about seventeen miles, and the direction of Al-Sufayna from our last halting place was South-East five degrees. Though it was night when we encamped, Shaykh Mas'ud set out to water his moaning camels: they had not quenched their thirst for three days. He returned in a depressed state, having been bled by the soldiery at the well to the extent of forty piastres, or about eight shillings. Af ter supper we spread our rugs and prepared to rest. And here I first remarked the coolness of the nights proving at this season of the year, a consider able altitude above the sea.

To my great disappoint- irface ment, a stir was observable in the Caravan. I at once 5y thi understood that another night-march was in store for us. frame At six p.m. we again mounted, and turned towards , oftei the Eastern plain. A heavy shower was falling upon the s ray Western hills, whence came damp and dangerous blasts. :erou Between nine p.m. and the dawn of the next day we had ppres a repetition of the last night's scenes, over a road so rugged and dangerous, that I wondered how men could prefer to travel in the darkness. But the camels of Dam- 3 ascus were now worn out with fatigue ; they could not endure the sun, and our time was too precious for a halt, water My night was spent perched upon the front bar of my ie, Al Shugduf, encouraging the dromedary ; and that we had in th( not one fall excited my extreme astonishment.

About five hours afterwards we crossed a high a lakt ridge, and saw below us the camp of the Caravan, not )esert more than two miles distant. As we approached it, a ply 0 figure came running out to meet us. It was the boy Mo- andec hammed, who, heartily tired of riding a dromedary with aid tc his friend, and possibly hungry, hastened to inform my ardec companion Abdullah that he would lead him to his Shug- :ay. duf and to his son. The Shaykh, a little offended by the Dam- fact that for two days not a friend nor an acquaintance nmar. had taken the trouble to see or to inquire about him, re- 3any; ceived Mohammed roughly ; but the youth, guessing the ig th€ grievance, explained it away by swearing that he and all about the party had tried in vain to find us. This wore the We semblance of truth : it is almost impossible to come upon her any one who strays from his place in so large and motley a body.136 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. At eleven a.m . we had reached our station. It is about twenty-four miles from Al-Ghadir, and its direction is South-east ten degrees. It is called Al-Birkat (the Tank), from a large and now ruinous cistern built of hewn stone by the Caliph Harun. 1 The land belongs to the Utaybah Badawin, the bravest and most ferocious tribe in Al- Hijaz ; and the citizens denote their dread of these ban ditti by asserting that to increase their courage they drink their enemy's blood. 2 My companions shook their heads when questioned upon the subject, and prayed that we might not become too well acquainted with them—an ill- omened speech! The Pasha allowed us a rest of five hours at Al- Birkat: we spent them in my tent, which was crowded with Shaykh Abdullah's friends. To requite me for this inconvenience, he prepared for me an excellent water-pipe, a cup of coffee, which, untainted by cloves and by cinna mon, would have been delicious, and a dish of dry fruits. As we were now near the Holy City, all the Meccans were busy canvassing for lodgers and offering their services to pilgrims. Quarrels, too, were of hourly occurrence. In our party was an Arnaut, a white-bearded old man, so 1 A 'birkat' in this part of Arabia may be an artificial cistern or a natural basin; in the latter case it is smaller than a 'ghadir.' This road was a favourite with Harun al-Rashid, the pious tyrant who boasted that every year he performed either a pilgrimage or a crusade. The reader will find in d'Herbelot an account of the cele brated visit of Harun to the Holy Cities. Nor less known in Oriental history is the pilgrimage of Zubaydah Khatun (wife of Harun and mother of Amin) by this route. 2 Some believe this literally, others consider it a phrase expressive of blood-thirstiness. It is the only suspicion of cannibalism, if I may use the word, now attaching to Al-Hijaz. Possibly the disgust ing act may occasionally have taken place after a stern fight of more than usual rancour. Who does not remember the account of the Turkish officer licking his blood after having sabred the corpse of a Russian spy? It is said that the Mutayr and the Utaybah are not allowed to enter Meccah, even during the pilgrimage season.XX VI.—From Al-Suwayrhiyah to Meccah. 137 decrepit that he could scarcely stand, and yet so violent that no one could manage him but his African slave, a brazen-faced little wretch about fourteen years of age. Words were bandied between this angry senior and Shaykh Mas'ud, when the latter insinuated sarcastically, that if the former had teeth he would be more intelligible. The Arnaut in his rage seized a pole, raised it, and de livered a blow which missed the camel-man, but, which brought the striker headlong to the ground. Mas'ud ex claimed, with shrieks of rage, ' Have we come to this, that every old-woman Turk smites us?' Our party had the greatest trouble to quiet the quarrelers. The Arab listened to us when we threatened him with the Pasha. But the Arnaut, whose rage was ' like red-hot steel,' would hear nothing but our repeated declarations, that unless he behaved more like a pilgrim, we should be compelled to leave him and his slave behind. At four p.m . we left Al-Birkat, and travelled East wards over rolling ground thickly wooded. There was a network of footpaths through the thickets, and clouds obscured the moon; the consequence was inevitable loss of way. About 2 a.m . we began ascending hills in a south-westerly direction, and presently we fell into the bed of a large rock-girt Fiumara, which runs from east to west. The sands were overgrown with saline and sal- solaceous plants; the Coloquintida, which, having no support, spreads along the ground 1 ; the Senna, with its small green leaf; the Rhazya stricta 2 ; and a large luxuri- ant variety of the Asclepias gigantea, 8 cotton ed over with 1 Coloquintida is here used, as in most parts of the East, medi cinally. The pulp and the seeds of the ripe fruit are scooped out, an the rind is filled with milk, which is exposed to the night air and drunk in the morning. 2 Used in Arabian medicine as a refrigerant and tonic.

At 6 a.m. (Sept. 9th) we left the Fiumara, and, turning to the West, we arrived about an hour after wards at the station. Al-Zaribah, 'the valley,' is an undulating plain amongst high granite hills. In many parts it was faintly green; water was close to the surface, and rain stood upon the ground. During the night we had travelled about twenty-three miles, and our present station was south-east 56° from our last. Having pitched the tent and eaten and slept, we pre pared to perform the ceremony of Al-Ihram (assuming the pilgrim-garb), as Al-Zaribah is the Mikat, or the ap pointed place. 1 Between the noonday and the afternoon prayers a barber attended to shave our heads, cut our nails, and trim our mustachios. Then, having bathed and perfumed ourselves,—the latter is a questionable sought apple of Sodom. Yet, if truth be told, the soft green bag is as unlike an apple as can be imagined; nor is the hard and brittle yellow rind of the ripe fruit a whit more resembling. The Arabs use the thick and acrid milk of the green bag with steel filings as a tonic, and speak highly of its effects; they employ it also to intoxi cate or narcotise monkeys and other animals which they wish to catch. It is esteemed in Hindu medicine. The Nubians and Indians use the filaments of the fruit as tinder; they become white and shi ning as floss-silk. The Badawin also have applied it to a similar pur pose. Our Egyptian travellers call it the ' Silk-tree'; and in Northern Africa, where it abounds, Europeans make of it stuffing for the mattresses, which are expensive, and highly esteemed for their cool ness and cleanliness. In Bengal a kind of gutta percha is made by boiling the juice. This weed, so common in the East, may one day become in the West an important article of commerce. 1 'Al-Ihram' literally meaning 'prohibition' or 'making unlawful,' equivalent to our 'mortification,' is applied to the ceremony of the toilette, and also to the dress itself. The vulgar pronounce the word 'heram,' or 'rehram.' It is opposed to v ihlal,' ' making lawful' or ' returning to laical life.' The further from Meccah it is assumed, provided that it be during the three months of Hajj, the greater is the religious merit of the pilgrim; consequently some come from India and Egypt in the dangerous attire. Those coming from the North assume the pilgrim-garb at or off the village of Rabigh.XXVI. —From Al-Suwayrhiyah to Meccah. 139 nara, point, we donned the attire, which is nothing but two ifter- new cotton cloths, each six feet long by three and a half is an broad, white, with narrow red stripes and fringes: in fact, nany the costume called in the baths at Cairo. 1 One rface, of these sheets, technically termed the Ridu, is thrown ,t we over the back, and, exposing the arm and shoulder, is esent knotted at the right side in the style Wishah. The Izar is wrapped round the loins from waist to knee,and, knotted ; pre- or tucked in at the middle, supports itself. Our heads g the were bare, and nothing was allowed upon the instep. 2 It j ap. is said that some clans of Arabs still preserve this religious noon but most uncomfortable costume; it is doubtless of an- t our c ^ en t date, and to this day, in the regions lying west of ithed ^e Red Sea, it continues to be the common dress of the lable people. &gt;ag is After the toilette, we were placed with our faces in arittle direction of Meccah, and ordered to say aloud, 3 ' I vow Arabs this Ihram of Hajj (the pilgrimage) and the Umrah (the ; as ^ Llttle Pilgrimage) to Allah Almighty I' Having thus per- sh^to J ormed a two-bow prayer, we repeated, without rising idians rom the sitting position, these words, 'O Allah! verily d shi- purpose the Hajj and the Umrah, then enable me to r pur- accomplish the two, and accept them both of me, and •thern make both blessed to me!'

No partner hast Thou, here am I 1 !' And we were warned to repeat these words as often as possible, until the conclusion of the ceremonies. 1 hen Shaykh Abdullah, who acted as director of our con sciences, bade us be good pilgrims, avoiding quarrels, immorality, bad language, and light conversation. We must so reverence life that we should avoid killing game, causing an animal to fly, and even pointing it out for de struction 8 ; nor should we scratch ourselves, save with the open palm, lest vermin be destroyed, or a hair uprooted by the nail. We were to respect the sanctuary by sparing the trees, and not to pluck a single blade of grass. As regards personal considerations, we were to abstain from all oils, perfumes, and unguents; from washing the head with mallow or with lote leaves; from dyeing, shaving, cutting, or vellicating a single pile or hair; and though we might take advantage of shade, and even form it with upraised hands, we must by no means cover our sconces. For each infraction of these ordinances we must sacrifice a sheep 4 ; and it is commonly said by Moslems that none 1 'Talbiyat' is from the word Labbayka ('here I am') in the cry—■ ' Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'! (Labbayka) LA Sharika laka, Labbayk'! Inna 'l-hamda wa *1 ni'amata laka wa '1 mulk! La Sharika laka, Labbayk'!' Some add, ' Here I am. and I honour thee, I the son of thy two slaves: beneficence and good are all between thy hands.' A single Talbiyah is a 'Shart' or positive condition, and its repetition is a Sunnat or Custom of the Prophet. The 'Talbiyat' is allowed in anv language, but is preferred in Arabic. It has a few varieties; the form above given is the most common. 2 The object of these ordinances is clearly to inculcate the strictest observance of the 'truce of God.' Pilgrims, however, are allowed to slay, if necessary, 'the five noxious,' viz., a crow, a kite, a scorpion, a rat, and a biting dog. 3 The victim is sacrificed as a confession that the offender deems himself worthy of death: the offerer is not allowed to taste any portion of bis offering.XXVI.—From Al-Suwayrkiyah to Meccah. but the Prophet could be perfect in the intricacies of as pilgrimage. Old Ali began with an irregularity: he en declared that age prevented his assuming the garb, m- but that, arrived at Meccah, he would clear himself by Is, an offering. Ve The wife and daughters of a Turkish pilgrim of our ie, party assumed the Ihram at the same time as ourselves, ie- They appeared dressed in white garments; and they had he exchanged the Lisam, that coquettish fold of muslin by which veils without concealing the lower part of the face, he for a hideous mask, made of split, dried, and plaited palm- ■ds leaves, with two 'bulls'-eyes' for light. 1 I could not ils, help laughing when these strange figures met my sight, ith and, to judge from the shaking of their shoulders, they ig, were not less susceptible to the merriment which they rht had caused. &gt;ed At three p.m . we left Al-Zaribah, travelling towards «or the South-\\ est, and a wondrously picturesque scene met . a the eye. Crowds hurried along, habited in the pilgrim- •ne garb, whose whiteness contrasted strangely with their — black skins; their newly shaven heads glistening in the sun, and their long black hair streaming in the wind. The rocks rang with shouts of Lahbayk! Labbayk! At a pass we fell in with the Wahhabis, accompanying the Baghdad Caravan, screaming 'Here am I'; and, guided iw0 by a large loud kettle-drum, they followed in double file igle the camel of a standard-bearer, whose green flag bore in js^a huge white letters the formula of the Moslem creed. ^ They were wild-looking mountaineers, dark and fierce, ^ith hair twisted into thin Dalik or plaits: each was the armed with a long spear, a matchlock, or a dagger, are They were seated upon coarse wooden saddles, without ite. c ushions or stirrups, a fine saddle-cloth alone denoting a -ms 1 reaso n why this 'ugly' must be worn, is, that a woman's any ^ Gunn S the Pilgrimage ceremonies is not allowed to touch heri j 2 Pilgviniugc to A l-Mcidtncih and Mecccih. chief. The women emulated the men; they either guided their own dromedaries, or, sitting in pillion, they clung to their husbands j veils they disdained, and their counten ances certainly belonged not to a 'soft sex. 1 hese Wahhabis were by no means pleasant companions. Most of them were followed by spare dromedaries, either un laden or carrying water-skins, fodder, fuel, and other necessaries for the march. The beasts delighted in dashing furiously through our file, which being lashed together, head and tail, was thrown each time into the greatest confusion. And whenever we were observed smoking, we were cursed aloud for Infidels and Idolaters. Looking back at Al-Zaribah, soon after our de parture, I saw a heavy nimbus settle upon the hill-tops, a sheet of rain being stretched between it and the plain. The low grumbling of thunder sounded joyfully in our ears. We hoped for a shower, but were disappointed by a dust-storm, which ended with a few heavy drops. There arose a report that the Badawin had attacked a party of Meccans with stones, and the news caused men to look exceeding grave. At five p.m . we entered the wide bed of the Fiumara, down which we were to travel all night. Here the country falls rapidly towards the sea, as the increasing heat of the air, the direction of the watercourses, and signs of violence in the torrent-bed show. The Fiumara varies in breadth from a hundred and fifty feet to three- quarters of a mile; its course, I was told, is towards the South-West, and it enters the sea near Jeddah. The channel is a coarse sand, with here and there masses of sheet rock and patches of thin vegetation. At about half-past five p.m . we entered a suspicious- looking place. On the right was a stony buttress, along whose base the stream, when there is one, swings; and to this depression was our road limited by the rocks and thorn trees which filled the other half of the channel.XXVI. — From Al-Suwayrkiyah to Meccah. 143 The left side was a precipice, grim and barren, but not so abrupt as its brother. Opposite us the way seemed barred by piles of hills, crest rising above crest into the far blue distance. Day still smiled upon the upper peaks, but the lower slopes and the Fiumara bed were already curtained with grey sombre shade. A damp seemed to fall upon our spirits as we approached this Valley Perilous. I remarked that the voices of the women and children sank into silence, and the loud Labbayk of the pilgrims were gradually stilled. Whilst still speculating upon the cause of this phenomenon, it became apparent. A small curl of the smoke, like a lady's ringlet, on the summit of the right-hand precipice, caught my eye; and simultaneous with the echoing crack of the matchlock, a high-trotting dromedary in front of me rolled over upon the sands,—a bullet had split its heart—throwing the rider a goodly somersault of five or six yards. Ensued terrible confusion; women screamed, children cried, and men vociferated, each one striving with might and main to urge his animal out of the place of death. But the road being narrow, they only managed to jam the vehicles in a solid immovable mass. At every match lock shot, a shudder ran through the huge body, as when the surgeon's scalpel touches some more sensitive nerve. The Irregular horsemen, perfectly useless, galloped up and down over the stones, shouting to and ordering one another. The Pasha of the army had his carpet spread at the foot of the left-hand precipice, and debated over his pipe with the officers what ought to be done. No good genius whispered 'Crown the heights.' Then it was that the conduct of the Wahhabis found favour in my eyes. They came up, galloping their camels,— 'Torrents less rapid, and less rash,— ' with their elf-locks tossing in the wind, and their flaring144 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. matches casting a strange lurid light over their features. Taking up a position, one body began to fire upon the ^ Utaybah robbers, whilst two or three hundred, dismount ing, swarmed up the hill under the guidance of the pisto Sharif Zayd. I had remarked this nobleman at Al- t h a t Madinah as a model specimen of the pure Arab. Like an j, all Sharifs, he is celebrated for bravery, and has killed so v many with his own hand. 1 When urged at Al-Zaribah Sha&gt; to ride into Meccah, he swore that he would not leave boy the Caravan till in sight of the walls; and, fortunately peop for the pilgrims, he kept his word. Presently the firing Sha&gt; was heard far in our rear, the robbers having fled. The was head of the column advanced, and the dense body of mani pilgrims opened out. Our forced halt was now exchanged behii for a flight. It required much management to steer our a j wa Desert-craft clear of danger; but Shaykh Mas'ud was g entl equal to the occasion. That many were not, was evident The by the boxes and baggage that strewed the shingles. I offen had no means of ascertaining the number of men killed but £ and wounded: reports were contradictory, and exaggera- pr0V( tion unanimous. The robbers were said to be a hundred and fifty in number; their object was plunder, and they large would eat the shot camels. But their principal ambition us _ was the boast, 'We, the Utaybah, on such and such a i The Sharifs are born and bred to fighting: the peculiar privileges of their caste favour their development of pugnacity. Thus, the modern diyah, or price of blood, being 800 dollars for a common Moslem, the chiefs demand for one of their number double that sum, with a sword, a camel, a female slave, and other items, and, if one of their slaves or servants be slain, a fourfold price. The rigorous way in which this custom is carried out gives the Sharif ^ and his retainer great power among the Arabs. As a general rule, they are at the bottom of all mischief. It was a Sharif (Hosayn bin and t Ali) who tore down and trampled upon the British flag at Mocha; a gloon Sharif (Abd al-Rahman of Waht) who murdered Captain Mylne ^ c near Lahedge.

At the beginning of the skirmish I had primed my pistols, and sat with them ready for use. But soon seeing that there was nothing to be done, and wishing to make an impression,—nowhere does Bobadil now 'go down' so well as in the Kast,—I called aloud for my supper. Shaykh Nur, exanimate with fear, could not move. The boy Mohammed ejaculated only an 'Oh, sir!' and the people around exclaimed in disgust, ' By Allah, he eats!' Shaykh Abdullah, the Meccan, being a man of spirit, was amused by the spectacle. 'Are these Afghan manners, Effendim?' he enquired from the Shugduf behind me. 'Yes, I replied aloud, 'in my country we always dine before an attack of robbers, because that gentry is in the habit of sending men to bed supperless.' The Shaykh laughed aloud, but those around him looked offended. I thought the bravado this time mal place; but a little event which took place on my way to Jeddah proved that it was not quite a failure. As we advanced, our escort took care to fire every large dry Asclepias, to disperse the shades which buried us. Again the scene became wondrous wild:— ' Full many a waste I've wander'd o'er, Clomb many a crag, cross'd many a shore, But, by my halidome, A scene so rude, so wild as this. Yet so sublime in barrenness, Ne'er did my wandering footsteps press, Where'er I chanced to roam.' On either side were ribbed precipices, dark, angry, and towering above, till their summits mingled with the glooms of night; and between them formidable looked the chasm, down which our host hurried with shouts and discharges of matchlocks. The torch-smoke and the mght-fires of flaming Asclepias formed a canopy, sable vol. 11. rj ' 10 ■■146 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. above and livid red below; it hung over our heads like a sheet, and divided the cliffs into two equal parts. Here the fire flashed fiercely from a tall thorn, that crackled and shot up showers of sparks into the air ; there it died away in lurid gleams, which lit up a truly Stygian scene. As usual, however, the picturesque had its inconveniences. There was no path. Rocks, stone-banks, and trees ob structed our passage. The camels, now blind in darkness, then dazzled by a flood of light, stumbled frequently , in some places slipping down a steep descent, in others slid ing over a sheet of mud. There were furious quarrels and fierce language between camel-men and their hirers, and threats to fellow-travellers; in fact, we were united in discord. I passed that night crying, 'Hai! Hai!' switching the camel, and fruitlessly endeavouring to fusti gate Mas'ud's nephew, who resolutely slept upon the water-bags. During the hours of darkness we made four or five halts, when we boiled coffee and smoked pipes, but man and beasts were beginning to suffer from a deadly fatigue. Dawn (Saturday, Sept. 10th) found us still travelling down the Fiumara, which here is about a hundred yards broad. The granite hills on both sides were less precipi tous ; and the borders of the torrent-bed became natural quays of stiff clay, which showed a water-mark of from twelve to fifteen feet in height. In many parts the bed was muddy ; and the moist places, as usual, caused acci dents. I happened to be looking back at Shaykh Abdul lah, who was then riding in old Ali bin Ya Sin's fine Shugduf; suddenly the camel's four legs disappeared from under him, his right side flattening the ground, and the two riders were pitched severally out of the smashed vehicle. Abdullah started up furious, and with great zest abused the Badawin, who were absent. ' Feed these Arabs,' he exclaimed, quoting a Turkish proverb, ' ancXXVI.—From Al-Suwayrkiyah to Meccah. 147 they will fire at Heaven! ' But I observed that, when Shaykh Mas ud came up, the citizen was only gruff. We then turned Northward, and sighted Al-Mazik, more generally known as Wady Laymun, the Valley of Limes. On the right bank of the Fiumara stood the Meccan Sharif s state pavilion, green and gold: it was surrounded by his attendants, and he had prepared to re ceive the Pasha of the Caravan. We advanced half a mile, and encamped temporarily in a hill-girt bulge of the Fiumara bed. At eight a.m. we had travelled about twenty-four miles from Al-Zaribah, and the direction of our present station was South-west 50°. . Sha y k h Mas'ud allowed us only four hours' halt; he wished to precede the main body. After breaking our last joyously upon limes, pomegranates, and fresh dates, we sallied forth to admire the beauties of the place. We are once more on classic ground—the ground of the ancient Arab poets,— ' ^ iS , the X iIIage ~ waste the halting place and home lna ' 0 er Rijam and Ghul wild beasts unheeded roam, n ayyan hill the channel lines have left their naked trace, ime-worn, as primal Writ that dints the mountain's flinty face; 1 '— and this Wady, celebrated for the purity of its air, has rom remote ages been a favourite resort of the Meccans.

Exactly at noon Mas'ud seized the halter of the fore most camel, and we started down the Fiumara. Troops of Badawi girls looked over the orchard walls laughingly, and children came out to offer us fresh fruit and sweet water. At two p.m ., travelling South-west, we arrived at a point where the torrent-bed turns to the right: and, quit ting it, we climbed with difficulty over a steep ridge of granite. Before three o'clock we entered a hill-girt plain, which my companions called ' Sola.' In some places were clumps of trees, and scattered villages warned us that we were approaching a city. Far to the left rose the blue peaks of Taif, and the mountain road, a white thread upon the nearer heights, was pointed out to me. Here I first saw the tree, or rather shrub, which bears the balm of Gilead, erst so celebrated for its tonic and stom achic properties. 1 I told Shaykh Mas'ud to break off a 1 The 'balsamon' of Theophrastus and Dioscorides, a corrup tion of the Arabic 'balisan' or ' basham,' by which name the Badawin know it. In the valley of the Jordan it was worth its weight in silver, and kings warred for what is now a weed. Cleopatra by a commission brought it to Egypt. It was grown at Heliopolis. The last tree died there, we are told by Niebuhr, in the early part of the seventeenth century (according to others, in a.d. 1502); a circum stance the more curious, as it was used by the Copts in chrisome, and by Europe for anointing kings. From Egypt it was carried to Al-Hijaz, where it now grows wild on sandy and stony grounds; but I could not discover the date of its naturalisation. Moslems gene rally believe it to have been presented to Solomon by Bilkis, Queen of Sheba. Bruce relates that it was produced at Mohammed's prayer from the blood of the Badr-Martyr. In the Gospel of Infancy (book i. ch. 8) we read,—'g. Hence they (Joseph and Mary) went out to that sycamore, which is now called MatareaXXVI.—From Al-Suwayrhiyah to Meccah. 149 twig, which he did heedlessly. The act was witnessed by our party with a roar of laughter ; and the astounded Shaykh was warned that he had become subject to an atoning sacrifice. 1 Of course he denounced me as the instigator, and I could not fairly refuse assistance. The tree has of late years been carefully described by many botanists; I will only say that the bark resembled in colour a cherry-stick pipe, the inside was a light yellow, and the juice made my fingers stick together. At four p.m . we came to a steep and rocky Pass, up which we toiled with difficulty. The face of the country was rising once more, and again presented the aspect of numer ous small basins divided and surrounded by hills. As we (the modern and Arabic name for Heliopolis). 10. And in Matarea the Lord Jesus caused a well to spring forth, in which St. Mary washed his coat; 11. And a balsam is produced or grows in that country from the sweat which ran down there from the Lord Jesus.' The sycamore is still shown, and the learned recognise in this ridiculous old legend the ' hiero-sykaminon,' of pagan Egypt, under which Isis and Horus sat. Hence Sir J. Maun- deville and an old writer allude reverently to the sovereign virtues of 'bawme.' I believe its qualities to have been exaggerated, but have found it useful in dressing wounds. Burckhardt (vol. ii. p. 124) alludes to, but appears not to have seen it. The best balsam is produced upon stony hills like Arafat and Muna. In hot weather incisions are made in the bark, and the soft gum which exudes is collected in bottles. The best kind is of the consistence of honey, and yellowish-brown, like treacle. It is frequently adulterated with water, when, if my informant Shaykh Abdullah speak truth, it becomes much lighter in weight. I never heard of the vipers which Pliny mentions as abounding in these trees, and which Bruce declares were shown to him alive at Jeddah and al Yambu*. Dr. Carter found the balm, under the name of Luban Dukah, among the Gara tribe of Eastern Arabia, and botanists have seen it at Aden. We may fairly question its being originally from the banks of the Jordan. 1 This being one of the ' Muharramdt,' or actions forbidden to a pilgrim At all times, say the Moslems, there are three vile trades, viz., those of the Harik al-Hajar (stone-burner), the Kdti' al-Shajar (tree-cutter, without reference to Hawarden, N.B.), and the Biyi' al- Bashar (man-seller, vulg.

Abd al-Muttahb bin Ghalib is a dark, beardless old man with African features derived from his mother. He was plainly dressed in white garments and a white muslin turband, 1 which made him look jet black; he rode an ambling mule, and the only emblem of his dignity was the large green satin The ' Main Pass' of Meccab. umbrella born by an attendant on foot, 2 Scattered around him were about forty matchlock men, mostly slaves. At long intervals, after their father, came his four sons, Riza Bey, Abdullah, Ali, and Ahmad, the latter still a child. The three elder brothers rode splendid drome daries at speed ; they were young men of light complexion, with the true Meccan cast of features, showily dressed in bright coloured silks, and armed, to denote their rank, with sword and gold-hilted dagger. 3 1 This attire was customary even in Al-Idrisi's time. 2 From India to Abyssinia the umbrella is the sign of royalty: the Arabs of Meccah and Sena'a probably derived the custom from the Hindus. 3 I purposely omit long descriptions of the Sharif, my fellow- travellers, Messrs. Didier and Hamilton, being far more competent to lay the subject before the public. A few political remarks may not be deemed out of place. The present Sharif, despite his civilised training at Constantinople, is, and must be a fanatic, bigoted man. He applied for the expulsion of the British Vice-Consul at Jeddah, on the grounds that an infidel should not hold position in the Holy Land. His pride and reserve have made him few friends, althoughash XXVI.—From Al-Stiwayrkiyah to Meccah. 151 We halted as evening approached, and strained our eyes, but all in vain, to catch sight of Meccah, which lies in a winding valley. By Shaykh Abdullah's direction I recited, after the usual devotions, the following prayer. The reader is forwarned that it is difficult to preserve the flowers of Oriental rhetoric in a European tongue. the Meccans, with their enthusiastic nationality, extol his bravery to the skies, and praise him for conduct as well as for courage. His position at present is anomalous. Ahmad Pasha of Al-Hijaz rules politically as representative of the Sultan. The Sharif, who, like the Pope, claims temporal as well as spiritual dominion, attempts to command the authorities by force of bigotry. The Pasha heads the Turkish, now the ruling party. The Sharif has in his interest the Arabs and the Badawin. Both thwart each other on all possible occasions; quarrels are bitter and endless; there is no government, and the vessel of the State is in danger of being water-logged, in con sequence of the squabbling between her two captains. When I was at Meccah all were in a ferment, the Sharif having, it is said, insisted upon the Pasha leaving Taif. The position of the Turks in Al-Hijaz becomes every day more dangerous. Want of money presses upon them, and reduces them to degrading measures In February, 1853, the Pasha hired a forced loan from the merchants, and but for Mr. Cole's spirit and firmness, the English proteges would have been compelled to contribute their share. After a long and animated discussion, the Pasha yielded the point by imprisoning his recusant subjects, who insisted upon Indians paying, like them selves. He waited in person with an apology upon Mr. Cole. 1 hough established at Jeddah since 1838, the French and English Consuls, contented with a proxy, never required a return of visit from the Governor. If the Turks be frequently reduced to such ex pedients for the payment of their troops, they will soon be swept from the land. On the other hand, the Sharif approaches a crisis. His salary, paid by the Sultan, may be roughly estimated at ^15,000 per annum. If the Turks maintain their footing in Arabia, it will probably be found that an honourable retreat at Stambul is better for the thirty-first descendant of the Prophet than the turbulent life of Meccah; or that a reduced allowance of ^500 per annum would place him in a higher spiritual, though in a lower temporal position. Since the above was written the Sharif Abd al-Muttalib has been de posed. The Arabs of Al-Hijaz united in revolt against the Sultan, but after a few skirmishes they were reduced to subjection by their old ruler the Sharif bin Aun.152 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah.

And have Mercy upon our Lord Mohammed, and upon the Progeny of our Lord Moham med, and upon his Followers, One and All!' This was concluded with the ' Talbiyat,' and with an especial prayer for myself. We again mounted, and night completed our dis appointment. About one a.m . I was aroused by general excitement. 'Meccah! Meccah!' cried some voices; ' The Sanctuary! O the Sanctuary !' exclaimed others; and all burst into loud ' Labbayk,' not unfrequently broken by sobs. I looked out from my litter, and saw by the light of the Southern stars the dim outlines of a large city, a shade darker than the surrounding plain. We were passing over the last ridge by a cutting called the Saniyat Kuda'a, the winding-place of the cut. 1 The ' winding path ' is flanked on both sides by watch-towers, which command the Darb al-Ma'ala or road leading from the North into Meccah. Thence we passed into the Ma'abidah (Northern suburb), where the Sharif s Palace is built. 2 After this, on the left hand, came 1 Saniyat means a ' winding path,' and Kuda'a, ' the cut.' Formerly Meccah had three gates: 1. Bab al-Ma'ala, North-East; 2. Bab al-Umrah, or Bab al-Zahir, on the Jeddah road. West; and 3, Bab al-Masfal on the Yaman road. These were still standing in the twelfth century, but the walls were destroyed. It is better to enter Meccah by day and on foot; but this is not a matter of vital consequence in pilgrimage. 2 It is a large whitewashed building, with extensive wooden balconied windows, but no pretensions to architectural splendour. Around it trees grow, and amongst them I remarked a young cocoa.XXVI.—From Al-Suwayrkiyah to Meccah. 153 n) and the deserted abode of the Sharif bin Aun, now said to be th safe a ' haunted house. 1 ' Opposite to it lies the Jannat al- Dd, my Ma'ala, the holy cemetery of Meccah.

From Wady Laymun to Meccah the distance, ao cording to my calculation, was about twenty-three miles, the direction South-East forty-five degrees. We ar rived on the morning of Sunday, the 7th Zu'l Hijjah (nth September, 1853), and had one day before the beginning of the pilgrimage to repose and visit the Harim. I conclude this chapter with a few remarks upon the watershed of Al-Hijaz. The country, in my humble opinion, has a compound slope, Southwards and \\ est wards. I have, however, little but the conviction of the modern Arabs to support the assertion that this part of Arabia declines from the North. All declare the course of water to be Southerly, and believe the fountain ot Arafat to pass underground from Baghdad. The slope, as geographers know, is still a disputed point. Ritter, Jomard, and some old Arab authors, make the countrj rise towards the south, whilst Wallin and others express an opposite opinion. From the sea to Al-Musahhal is a gentle rise. The water-marks of the Fiumaras show that Al-Madinah is considerably above the coast, thougt geographers may not be correct in claiming for Jaba Radhwa a height of six thousand feet; yet that elevatior is not perhaps too great for the plateau upon whicl stands the Apostle's burial-place. From Al-Madinah tc Al-Suwayrkiyah is another gentle rise, and from the latter to Al-Zaribah stagnating water denotes a level. I believe the report of a perennial lake on the easterr. boundary of Al-Hijaz, as little as the river placed bj Ptolemy between Yambu' and Meccah. No Badaw could tell me of this feature, which, had it existed, woulc have changed the whole conditions and history of the X T _&lt;part iii. MECCACHAPTER XXVII. the first visit to the house of allah. The boy Mohammed left me in the street, and having at last persuaded the sleepy and tired Indian porter, by violent kicks and testy answers to twenty cautious queries, to swing open the huge gate of his fortress, he rushed up stairs to embrace his mother. After a minute I heard the Zaghritah, 1 Lululu, or shrill cry which in these lands welcomes the wanderer home; the sound so gladdening to the returner sent a chill to the stranger's heart. Presently the youth returned. His manner had changed from a boisterous and jaunty demeanour to one of grave and attentive courtesy—I had become his guest. He led me into the gloomy hall, seated me upon a large carpeted Mastabah, or platform, and told his bara Miyan 2 (great Sir), the Hindustani porter, to bring a light. 1 The Egyptian word is generally pronounced 'Zaghrutah,' the plural is Zagharit, corrupted to Ziraleet. The classical Arabic term is 'Tahlil' ; thePersians call the cry ' Kil.' It is peculiar towomen, and is formed by raising the voice to its highest pitch, vibrating it at the same time by rolling the tongue, whose modulations express now joy, now grief. To my ear it always resembled the brain-piercing notes of a fife. Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds. The ' unsavoury comparison,' however, may owe its origin to the circumstance that Dr. Buchanan heard it at the orgies of Ja- , gannath. 2 As an Indian is called ' Miyan,' sir, an elderly Indian becomes 'bara Miyan,' great or ancient sir. I shall have occasion to speak at a futur* period of these Indians at Meccah.160 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Meanwhile a certain shuffling of slippered feet above in. formed my hungry ears that the Kabirah, 1 the mistress of the house, was intent on hospitable thoughts. When the camels were unloaded, appeared a dish of fine vermicelli, browned and powdered with loaf-sugar. The boy Mohammed, I, and Shaykh Nur, lost no time in exerting our right hands; and truly, after our hungry journey, we found the Kunafah delicious. After the meal we procured cots from a neighbouring coffee-house, and we lay down, weary, and anxious to snatch an houi or two of repose. At dawn we were expected to perform our Tawaf al-Kudim, or ' Circumambulation of Arrival,' at the Harim. Scarcely had the first smile of morning beamed upon the rugged head of the eastern hill, Abu Kubays, 2 when we arose, bathed, and proceeded in our pilgrim-garb to the Sanctuary. We entered by the Bab al-Ziyadah, or prin cipal northern door, descended two long flights of steps, traversed the cloister, and stood in sight of the Bayt Allah. * * * * ❖ * ❖ There at last it lay, the bourn of my long and weary Pilgrimage, realising the plans and hopes of many and many a year. The mirage medium of Fancy invested the 1 ' Sitt al-Kabirah,' or simply ' Al-Kabirah,' the Great Lady, is the title given to the mistress of the house. 2 This hill bounds Meccah on the East. According to many Moslems, Adam, with his wife and his son Seth, lie buried in a cave here. Others place his tomb at Muna; the Majority at Najaf. The early Christians had a tradition that our first parents were interred under Mount Calvary; the Jews place their grave near Hebron. Habil (Abel), it is well known, is supposed to be entombed at Damascus: and Kabil (Cain) rests at last under Jabal Shamsan, the highest wall of the Aden crater, where he and his progeny, tempted by Iblis, erected the first fire-temple. It certainly deserves to be the sepulchre of the first murderer. The worship, however, was prob ably imported from India, where Agni (the fire god) was, as the Vedas prove, the object of man's earliest adoration.XXVII.—The First Visit to the House of Allah. 161 /e in- huge catafalque and its gloomy pall with peculiar charms. ;ss oi There were no giant fragments of hoar antiquity as in Vhen Egypt, no remains of graceful and harmonious beauty as fine m Greece and Italy, no barbarous gorgeousness as in the The buildings of India ; yet the view was strange, unique—and ne in ^ ow ^ ew h^ve looked upon the celebrated shrine!

The origin of this is. that 'ted ® enu Shaybah means the 'sons of an old woman' as well as be the descendants of Shaybah.' And history tells us that the Benu Shay- prob are deriv ed from one Shaybah (bin Osman, bin Talhah, bin Vedas ^^ah, bin Talhah, bin Abd al-Dar), who was sent by Mu'awiyah to make some alterations in the Ka'abah.

Then we proceeded to the • jj ; Shafe'is' place of worship—the open pavement between ' the Makam Ibrahim and the well Zemzem—where we : performed the usual two-bow prayer in honour of the g a i Mosque. This was followed by a cup of holy water and at j a present to the Sakkas, or carriers, who for the considera- e pj tion distributed, in my name, a large earthen vaseful to f ac poor pilgrims. mj The word Zemzem has a doubtful origin. Some ^oc derive it from the Zam Zam, or murmuring of its waters, cer others from Zam ! Zam ! (fill! fill! i.e. the bottle), Hagar's h i r impatient exclamation when she saw the stream. Sale translates it stay ! stay ! and says that Hagar called out j s in the Egyptian language, to prevent her son wandering. baj The Hukama, or Rationalists of Al-Islam, who invariably to | connect their faith with the worship of Venus, especially, anc and the heavenly bodies generally, derive Zemzem from wr the Persian, and make it signify the 'great luminary.' fla ' Hence they say the Zemzem, as well as the Ka'abah, tea denoting the Cuthite or Ammonian worship of sun and wa] fire, deserves man's reverence. So the Persian poet ^ Khakani addresses these two buildings;— p re ' O Ka'abah, thou traveller of the heavens ! ' f art ' O Venus, thou fire of the world! ' ^ Thus Wahid Mohammed, founder of the Wahidiyah sect, ^ identifies the Kiblah and the sun ; wherefore he says the door fronts the East. By the names Yaman (' right- ^ hand '), Sham (' left-hand '), Kubul, or the East wind ('fronting'), and Dubur, or the West wind ('from the ^ back '), it is evident that worshippers fronted the rising ^ sun. According to the Hukama, the original Black Stone represents Venus, ' which in the border of the ^ heavens is a star of the planets,' and symbolical of tfie ^ Ka 'abah key was committed to the charge of Osman bin Talhah by the Prophet.XXVII.—The First Visit to the House of Allah. 163 ' lll; generative power of nature, ' by whose passive energy lC ' w the universe was warmed into life and motion.'

And Musaylimah, who in his ^ nd attempt to found a fresh faith, gained but the historic epithet of ' Liar, allowed his followers to turn their t0 faces in any direction, mentally ejaculating, «I address myself to thee, who hast neither side nor figure ; ' a )me doctrine which might be sensible in the abstract,'but ers ' certainly not material enough and pride-flattering to win f 1 s him many converts in Arabia. 5al ® The produce of Zemzem is held in great esteem. It is use d for drinking and religious ablution, but for no l |V baser purposes ; and the Meccans advise pilgrims always ^ y t0 break th eir fast with it. It is apt to cause diarrhoea 1 y&gt; and boils, and I never saw a stranger drink it without a r0 „ wr y f ac e. Sale is decidedly correct in his assertion : the )ah flavour is a sal t-bitter, much resembling an infusion of a and teas P oonful of E P s om salts in a large tumbler of tepid 3oet water * Moreover, it is exceedingly 'heavy' to the digestion.

Upon this the P assa ge Mr. W. Muir (Life of Mahomet, vol. 1, p. cclviii.) ■ the remarks that ' the flavour of stale water bottled up for ^ months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn.' But it might easily be analysed. The water is transmitted to distant regions in glazed164 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. earthern jars covered with basket-work, and sealed by the Zemzemis. Religious men break their lenten fast with it, apply it to their eyes to brighten vision, and imbibe a few drops at the hour of death, when Satan stands by holding a bowl of purest water, the price of the departing soul. Of course modern superstition is not idle about the waters of Zemzem. The copious supply of the well is considered at Meccah miraculous ; in distant countries it facilitates the pronounciation of Arabic to the student; and everywhere the nauseous draught is highly meritorious in a religious point of view. We then advanced towards the eastern angle of the Ka'abah, in which is inserted the Black Stone ; and, standing about ten yards from it, repeated with upraised hands, ' There is no god but Allah alone. Whose Cove nant is Truth, and Whose Servant is Victorious. There is no god but Allah, without Sharer ; His is the Kingdom, to Him be Praise, and He over all Things is potent.' After which we approached as close as we could to the stone. A crowd of pilgrims preventing our touching it that time, we raised our hands to our ears, in the first position of prayer, and then lowering them, exclaimed, O Allah (I do this), in Thy Belief, and in verification of Thy Book, and in Pursuance of Thy Prophet's Example- may Allah bless Him and preserve ! O Allah, I extend my Hand to Thee, and great is my Desire to Thee ! 0 accept Thou my Supplication, and diminish my Ob stacles, and pity my Humiliation, and graciously grant me Thy Pardon !' After which, as we were still unable to reach the stone, we raised our hands to our ears, the palms facing the stone, as if touching it, recited the various religious formulae, the Takbir, the Tahlil, and the Ham- dilah, blessed the Prophet, and kissed the finger-tips of the right hand. The Prophet used to weep when he touched the Black Stone, and said that it was the place for the pouring forth of tears. According to most authors, theXXVII.—The First Visit to the House of Allah. 165 second Caliph also used to kiss it. For this reason most Moslems, except the Shafe'i school, must touch the stone with both hands and apply their lips to it, or touch it with the fingers, which should be kissed, or rub the palms upon it, and afterwards draw them down the face. Under cir cumstances of difficulty, it is sufficient to stand before the stone, but the Prophet's Sunnat, or practice, was to touch it. Lucian mentions adoration of the sun by kissing the hand. Then commenced the ceremony of Tawdf, 1 or circum- ambulation, our route being the Mataf—ihe low oval of polished granite immediately surrounding the Ka'abah. I 1 The Moslem in circumambulation presents his left shoulder; the Hindu's Pradakshina consists in walking round with the right side towards the fane or idol. Possibly the former may be a modification of the latter, which would appear to be the original form of the rite. Its conjectural significance is an imitation of the procession of the heavenly bodies, the motions of the spheres, and the dances of the angels. These are also imitated in the circu lar whirlings of the Darwayshes. And Al-Shahristani informs us that the Arab philosophers believed this sevenfold circumambulation to be symbolical of the motion of the planets round the sun. It was adopted by the Greeks and Romans, whose Ambarvalia and Ambur- balia appear to be eastern superstitions, introduced by Numa, or by the priestly line of princes, into their pantheism. And our processions round the parish preserve the form of the ancient rites, whose life is long since fled. Moslem moralists have not failed to draw spiritual food from this mass of materialism. 'To circuit the Bayt Ullah,' said the Pir Raukhan (As. Soc. vol. xi. and Dabistan, vol.iii., 'Miyan Bayazid'), 'and to be free from wickedness, and crime, and quarrels, is the duty enjoined by religion. But to circuit the house of the friend of Allah {i.e. the heart), to combat bodily propensities, and to worship the Angels, is the business of the (mystic) path.' Thus Sa'adi, in his sermons,—which remind the Englishman of 'poor Yorick,'—' He who travels to the Ka'abah on foot makes a circuit of the Ka'abah, but he who performs the pilgrimage of the Ka'abah in his heart is encircled by the Ka'abah.' And the greatest Moslem divines sanction this visible representation of an invisible and heavenly shrine, by declaring that, without a material medium, it is impossible for man to worship the Eternal Spirit.i66 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. repeated, after my Mutawwif, or cicerone, 1 ' In the Name of Allah, and Allah is omnipotent ! I purpose to circuit seven circuits unto Almighty Allah, glorified and exalted!' This is technically called the Niyat (intention) of Tawaf. Then we began the prayer, ' O Allah (I do this), in Thy Belief, and in Verification of Thy Book, and in Faithful ness to Thy Covenant, and in Perseverance of the Example of the Apostle Mohammed—may Allah bless Him and preserve!' till we reached the place Al- Multazem, between the corner of the Black Stone and the Ka'abah door. Here we ejaculated, 'O Allah, Thou hast Rights, so pardon my transgressing them.' Opposite the door we repeated, ' O Allah, verily the House is Thy House, and the Sanctuary Thy Sanctuary, and the Safe guard Thy Safeguard, and this is the Place of him who flies to Thee from (hell) Fire!' At the little building called Makam Ibrahim we said, ' O Allah, verily this is the Place of Abraham, who took Refuge with and fled to Thee from the Fire !—O deny my Flesh and Blood, my Skin and Bones to the (eternal) Flames !' As we paced slowly round the north or Irak corner of the Ka'abah we exclaimed, 'O Allah, verily I take Refuge with Thee from Polytheism, and Disobedience, and Hypocrisy, and evil Conversation, and evil Thoughts con cerning Family, and Property, and Progeny!' When fronting the Mizab, or spout, we repeated the words, 'O Allah, verily I beg of Thee Faith which shall not decline, and a Certainty which shall not perish, and the good Aid of Thy Prophet Mohammed—may Allah bless Him and preserve! O Allah, shadow me in Thy Shadow on that Day when there is no Shade but Thy Shadow, and cause me to drink from the Cup of Thine Apostle Mohammed—may Allah bless Him and preserve!— that pleasant Draught after which is no Thirst to all Eternity, O Lord of Honour and Glory!' Turning the i The Mutawwif, or Dalil, is the guide at Meccah.XXVII.—The First Visit to the House of Allah. 167 west corner, or the Rukn al-Shami, we exclaimed, ' O Allah, make it an acceptable Pilgrimage, and a Forgive ness of Sins, and a laudable Endeavour, and a pleasant Action (in Thy sight), and a store which perisheth not, O Thou Glorious! O Thou Pardoner!' This was re peated thrice, till we arrived at the Yamani, or south corner, where, the crowd being less importunate, we touched the wall with the right hand, after the example of the Prophet, and kissed the finger-tips. Finally, be tween the south angle and that of the Black Stone, where our circuit would be completed, we said, 'O Allah, verily I take Refuge with Thee from Infidelity, and I take Refuge with Thee from Want, and from the Tortures of the Tomb, and from the Troubles of Life and Death. And I fly to Thee from Ignominy in this World and the next, and I implore Thy Pardon for the Present and for the Future. O Lord, grant to me in this Life Prosperity, and in the next Life Prosperity, and save me from the Punishment of Fire.' Thus finished a Shaut, or single course round the house. Of these we performed the first three at the pace called Harwalah, very similar to the French /as gymnas- tique, or Tarammul, that is to say, 'moving the shoulders as if walking in sand.' The four latter are performed in Ta'ammul, slowly and leisurely; the reverse of the Sai, or running. These seven Ashwat, or courses, are called collec tively one Usbu. The Moslem origin of this custom is too well known to require mention. After each Taufah or circuit, we, being unable to kiss or even to touch the Black Stone, fronted towards it, raised our hands to our ears, exclaimed, 44 In the Name of Allah, and Allah is omnipotent!' kissed our fingers, and resumed the cere mony of circumambulation, as before, with 'Allah, in Thy Belief,' &amp;c. At the conclusion of the Tawaf it was deemed advis able to attempt to kiss the stone. For a time I stood168 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. looking in despair at the swarming crowd of Badawi and they other pilgrims that besieged it. But the boy Mohammed had was equal to the occasion. During our circuit he had they displayed a fiery zeal against heresy and schism, by foully man abusing every Persian in his path 1 ; and the inopportune reac introduction of hard words into his prayers made the by ii latter a strange patchwork; as 'Ave Maria purissima,— leasl arrah, don't ye be letting the pig at the pot,—Sanctis- and sima,' and so forth. He might, for instance, be repeat- awa- ing 'And I take Refuge with Thee from Ignominy in this almc World,' when 'O thou rejected one, son of the rejected!' the 5 would be the interpolation addressed to some long- a ' bearded Khorasani,—'And in that to come'—'O hog sprit and brother of a hoggess!' And so he continued till I with wondered that none dared to turn and rend him. After grou vainly addressing the pilgrims, of whom nothing could be ance seen but a mosaic of occupits and shoulder-blades, the 'a 1 boy Mohammed collected about half a dozen stalwart awl Meccans, with whose assistance, by sheer strength, we wedged our way into the thin and light-legged crowd. the The Badawin turned round upon us like wild-cats, but press Ka'a i In a.d. 1674 some wretch smeared the Black Stone with impurity, and every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard. C The Persians, says Burckhardt, were suspected of this sacrilege, and m y ^ now their ill-fame has spread far; at Alexandria they were described Deec to me as a people who defile the Ka'abah. It is scarcely necessary to whic say that a Shi'ah, as well as a Sunni, would look upon such an action Thm with lively horror. The people of Meccah, however, like the Madani, have turned the circumstance to their own advantage, and make an occasional 'avanie.' Thus, nine or ten years ago, on the testimony w ^ 0 &gt; of a boy who swore that he saw the inside of the Ka 'abah defiled by Eter a Persian, they rose up, cruelly beat the schismatics, aud carried them we b off to their peculiar quarter the Shamiyah, forbidding their ingress to that the Ka'abah.

The season being autumn, they i ed had not swelled themselves with milk for six months; and ^ad they had become such living mummies, that I could have illy managed single-handed half a dozen of them. After thus me reaching the stone, despite popular indignation testified the by impatient shouts, we monopolised the use of it for at ,— least ten minutes. Whilst kissing it and rubbing hands tis- and forehead upon it I narrowly observed it, and came at- away persuaded that it is an aerolite. It is curious that his almost all travellers agree upon one point, namely, that 1!' the stone is volcanic. Ali Bey calls it ' mineralogically ' ig- a 'block of volcanic basalt, whose circumference is iog sprinkled with little crystals, pointed and straw-like, 1 I with rhombs of tile-red feldspath upon a dark back- ter ground, like velvet or charcoal, except one of its protuber- be ances, which is reddish.' Burckhardt thought it was he 'a lava containing several small extraneous particles of irt a whitish and of a yellowish substance.' we Having kissed the stone we fought our way through '•d. the crowd to the place called Al-Multazem. Here we •ut pressed our stomachs, chests, and right cheeks to the ~ Ka'abah, raising our arms high above our heads and ex- claiming, 'O Allah! O Lord of the Ancient House, free nd m y Neck from Hell-fire, and preserve me from every ill ed Deed, and make me contented with that daily bread to which Thou hast given to me, and bless me in all on Thou hast granted!' Then came the Istighfar, or beg an ging of pardon; 'I beg Pardon of Allah the most high, jjy who, there is no other God but He, the Living, the by Eternal, and unto Him I repent myself I ' After which m we blessed the Prophet, and then asked for ourselves all to that our souls most desired. 1 ly -— 10 1 Prayer is granted at fourteen places besides Al-Multazem, ie V ' Z ' •— [ 0 1.

Fatigue put this fresh trial completely out oi the question.XXV11.—The First Visit to the House of Allah. 171 and a lone woman, had made over for the season all the an ^ apartments to her brother, a lean old Meccan, of true ancient type, vulture-faced, kite-clawed, with a laugh like a hyena, and a mere shell of body. He regarded me with no favouring eye when I insisted as a guest upon having some place of retirement ; but he promised that, after our return from Arafat, a little store-room should be cleared out for me. With that I was obliged to be con tent, and to pass that day in the common male drawing- room of the house, a vestibule on the ground floor, called in Egypt a Takhta-bush. 1 Entering, to the left (a ) was a large Mastabah, or plat form, and at the bottom ( b ) a second, of smaller dimensions and foully dirty. Behind this was a dark and unclean c $7&gt; i&gt;&lt;L £=s store-room (c) containing the Hajis' baggage. Opposite the Mastabah was a firepan for pipes and coffee ( d), superintended by a family of lean Indians; and by the side (e ) a doorless passage led to a bathing-room ( f ) and stair case ( g). I had scarcely composed myself upon the carpeted Mastabah, when the remainder was suddenly invaded by the Turkish, or rather Slavo-Turk, pilgrims inhabiting the house, and a host of their visitors. They were large, hairy men, with gruff voices and square figures; they did not take the least notice of me, although feeling the intru sion, I stretched out my legs with a provoking nonchalance? At last one of them addressed me in Turkish, to which I 1 I have been diffuse in my description of this vestibule, as it is the general way of laying out a ground-floor at Meccah. During the pilgrimage time the lower hall is usually converted into a shop for the display of goods, especially when situated in a populous quarter. 2 This is equivalent to throwing oneself upon the sofa in Europe. Only in the East it asserts a decided claim to superiority; the West would scarcely view it in that light.172 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. replied by shaking my head. His question being inter- preted to me in Arabic, I drawled out, 11 My native place is the land of Khorasan.' This provoked a stern and stony stare from the Turks, and an 'ugh !' which said plainly enough, ' Then you are a pestilent heretic.' I surveyed them with a self-satisfied simper, stretched my legs a trifle farther, and conversed with my water-pipe. Presently, when they all departed for a time, the boy Mohammed raised, by request, my green box of medicines, and deposited it upon the Mastabah ; thus defining, as it were, a line of demarcation, and asserting my privilege to it before the Turks. Most of these men were of one party, headed by a colonel of Nizam, whom they called a Bey, My acquaintance with them began roughly enough, but afterwards, with some exceptions, who were gruff as an English butcher when accosted by a lean foreigner, they proved to be kind-hearted and not unsociable men.

Below, the minarets became pillars of count silver, and the cloisters, dimly streaked by oil lamps, their bounded the views of the temple with horizontal lines of i 5 shade. Wsfor Before nightfall the boy Mohammed rose to feed the to inc Mosque pigeons, for whom he had brought a pocketful of it a 4 barley. He went to the place where these birds flock— of the the line of pavement leading from the isolated arch to the Eastern cloisters. During the day women and children are to be seen sitting here, with small piles of grain upon little plaited trays of basket-work. For each they demand a copper piece ; and religious pilgrims consider it their duty to provide the reverend blue-rocks with a plentiful meal. The Hindu Pandits assert that Shiwa and his spouse, under the forms and names of Kapot-Eshwara (pigeon god) and Kapotesi, dwelt at Meccah. The dove was the device of the old Assyrian Empire, because it is supposed Semiramis was preserved by that bird. The Meccan pigeons, resembling those of Venice, are held sacred probably in consequence of the wild traditions of the Arabs about Noah's dove. Some authors declare that in Mohammed's time, among the idols of the Meccan Pantheon, was a pigeon carved in wood, and above it another, which Ali, mounting upon the Prophet's shoulder, pulled down. This might have been a Hindu, a Jewish, or a Christian symbol. The Moslems connect the pigeon 1 To distinguish it from the Jiyad (above the cemetery Al-Ma'ala) over which Khalid entered Meccah. Some topographers call the Jiyad upon which the fort is built 'the lesser,' and apply 'greater' to Jiyad Amir, the hill north of Meccah. 2 The Meccans, however, do not fail to boast of its strength; and has stood some sieges.XXVII.—The First Visit to the House of Allah. 175 on two occasions with their faith: first, when that bird appeared to whisper in Mohammed's ear; and, secondly, during the flight to Al-Madinah. Moreover, in many countries they are called ' Allah's Proclaimers,' because their movement when cooing resembles prostration. Almost everywhere the pigeon has entered into the history of religion, which probably induced Mr. Lascelles to incur the derision of our grandfathers by pronouncing it a ' holy bird.' At Meccah they are called the doves of the Ka'abah, and they never appear at table. They are remarkable for propriety when sitting upon the holy building. This may be a minor miracle: I would rather believe that there is some contrivance on the roof. My friend Mr. Bicknell remarks: 'This marvel, however, having of late years been suspended, many discern another omen of the approach of the long-predicted period when unbelievers shall desecrate the sacred soil.' Late in the evening I saw a negro in the state called Malbus—religious frenzy. To all appearance a Takruri, he was a fine and a powerful man, as the numbers required to hold him testified. He threw his arms wildly about him, uttering shrill cries, which sounded like le le le lei and when held, he swayed his body, and waved his head from side to side, like a chained and furious elephant, straining out the deepest groans. The Africans appear unusually subject to this nervous state which, seen by the ignorant and the imaginative, would at once suggest 'demoniacal possession. 1 ' Either their organisation is more impressionable, or more probably, the hardships, privations, and fatigues endured whilst wearily traversing inhos pitable wilds, and perilous seas, have exalted their 1 In the Mandal, or palm-divination, a black slave is considered the best subject.

Often they are seen prostrate on the pavement, or clinging to the curtain, or rubbing their foreheads upon the stones, weeping bitterly, and pouring forth the wildest ejacu lations. That night I stayed in the Harim till two a.m., wishing to see if it would be empty. But the morrow was to witness the egress to Arafat; many, therefore, passed the hours of darkness in the Harim. Numerous parties of pilgrims sat upon their rugs, with lanterns in front of them, conversing, praying, and contemplating the Ka'abah. The cloisters were full of merchants, who resorted there to 'talk shop,' and to vend such holy goods as combs, tooth-sticks, and rosaries. Before ten p.m . I found no opportunity of praying the usual two prostrations over the grave of Ishmael. After waiting long and patiently, at last I was stepping into the vacant place, when another pilgrim rushed forward; the boy Mohammed, assisted by me, instantly seized him, and, despite his cries and struggles, taught him to wait. Till midnight we sat chatting with the different ciceroni who came up to offer their services. I could not help remark ing their shabby and dirty clothes, and was informed that during pilgrimage, when splendour is liable to be spoiled, they wear out old dresses; and appear endimanches for the Muharram f6te, when most travellers have left the city. Presently my two companions, exhausted with fatigue, fell asleep; I went up to the Ka'abah, with the intention of 'annexing' a bit of the torn old Kiswat or curtain, but too many eyes were looking on. At this season of the year the Kiswat is much tattered at the base, partly by pilgrims' fingers, and partly by the strain of the cord which confines it when the wind is blowing. It is con sidered a mere peccadillo to purloin a bit of the venerable stuff; but as the officers of the temple make money by selling it, they certainly would visit detection with anXXVII.—The First Visit to the House of Allah. 177 unmerciful application of the quarterstaff. The piece in my possession was given to me by the boy Mohammed before I left Meccah. Waistcoats cut out of the Kiswah still make the combatants invulnerable in battle, and are considered presents fit for princes. The Moslems gener ally try to secure a strip of this cloth as a mark for the Koran, or for some such purpose. The opportunity, how ever, was favourable for a survey, and with a piece of tape, and the simple processes of stepping and spanning, I managed to measure all the objects concerning which I was curious. At last sleep began to weigh heavily upon my eyelids. I awoke my companions, and in the dizziness of slumber they walked with me through the tall narrow street from the Bab al-Ziyadah to our home in the Shamiyah. The brilliant moonshine prevented our complaining, as other travellers have had reason to do, of the darkness and the difficulty of Meccah's streets. The town, too, appeared safe; there were no watchmen, and yet people slept everywhere upon cots placed opposite their open doors. Arrived at the house, we made some brief preparations for snatching a few hours' sleep upon the Mastabah, a place so stifling, that nothing but utter exhaustion could induce lethargy there. vol . ir. 12CHAPTER XXVIII. the ceremonies of the yaum al-tarwiyah, or the first day. At ten a.m., on the 8th Zu 'l Hijjah, a.h. 1269 (Mon day, 12th Sept., 1853), habited in our Ihram, or pilgrim garbs, we mounted the litter. Shaykh Mas ud had been standing at the door from dawn-time, impatient to start before the Damascus and the Egyptian caravans made the road dangerous. Our delay arose from the tyrannical conduct of the boy Mohammed, who insisted upon leaving his little nephew behind. It was long before he yielded. I then placed the poor child, who was crying bitterly, in the litter between us, and at last we started. We followed the road by which the Caravans entered Meccah. It was covered with white-robed pilgrims, some few wending their way on foot 1 ; others riding, and all men barefooted and bareheaded. Most of the wealthier classes mounted asses. The scene was, as usual, one of strange contrasts: Badawin bestriding swift dromedaries; Turkish dignitaries on fine horses; the most picturesque beggars, and the most uninteresting Nizam. Not a little wrangling mingled with the loud bursts of Talbiyat. Dead animals dotted the ground, and carcasses had been cast into a dry tank, the Birkat al-Shami which caused every Badawi to 1 Pilgrims who would win the heavenly reward promised to those who walk, start at an early hour.XXVIII.—Ceremonies of the Yaunt Al-Tavwiyah. 179 hold his nose. 1 Here, on the right of the road, the poorer pilgrims, who could not find houses, had erected huts, and pitched their ragged tents. Traversing the suburb Al- Ma'b'dah (Ma'abadah), in a valley between the two barren prolongations of Kayka'an and Khandamah, we turned to the north-east, leaving on the left certain barracks of Turkish soldiery, and the negro militia here stationed, with the Saniyat KudcCa in the background. Then, advancing about 3000 paces over rising ground, we passed by the conical head of Jabal Nur, 2 and en tered the plain of many names. 8 It contained nothing but a few whitewashed walls, surrounding places of prayer, and a number of stone cisterns, some well pre served, others in ruins. All, however, were dry, and water-vendors crowded the roadside. Gravel and lumps of granite grew there like grass, and from under every large stone, as Shaykh Mas'ud took a delight in showing, a small scorpion, with tail curled over its back, fled, Parthian-like, from the invaders of its home. At eleven a.m., ascending a Mudarraj, or flight of stone steps, about thirty yards broad, we passed without difficulty, for we were in advance of the caravans, over the Akabah, or Steeps, 4 and the narrow, hill-girt entrance, to the low gravel basin in which Muna lies. 1 The true Badawi, when in the tainted atmosphere of towns, is always known by bits of cotton in his nostrils, or by his kerchief tightly drawn over his nose, a heavy frown marking extreme disgust. 2 Anciently called Hira. It is still visited as the place of the Prophet's early lucubrations, and because here the first verse of the Koran descended.

Muna, more classically called Mina, 1 is a place of con siderable sanctity. Its three standing miracles are these: The pebbles thrown at 'the Devil' return by angelic agency to whence they came; during the three Days of Drying Meat rapacious beasts and birds cannot prey there; and, lastly, flies do not settle upon the articles of food exposed so abundantly in the bazars. 3 During pilgrimage, houses are let for an exorbitant sum, and it becomes a 'World's Fair' of Moslem merchants. At all other seasons it is almost deserted, in consequence, says popu lar superstition, of the Rajm or (diabolical) lapidation. 8 Dis tant about three miles from Meccah, it is a long, narrow, straggling village, composed of mud and stone houses of one or two stories, built in the common Arab style. Traversing a narrow street, we passed on the left the Great Devil, which shall be described at a future time. After a quarter of an hour's halt, spent over pipes and coffee, we came to an open space, where stands the Mosque 'Al-Khayf.' Here, according to some Arabs, Adam lies, his head being at one end of one long wall, and his feet at another, whilst the dome covers his om phalic region. Grand preparations for fireworks were being made in this square; I especially remarked a fire- 1 If Ptolemy's 'Mincei' be rightly located in this valley, the present name and derivation ' Muna ' (desire), because Adam here desired Paradise of Allah, must be modern. Sale, following Pococke, makes ' Mina ' (from Mana) allude to the flowing of victims' blood. Possibly it may be the plural of Minyat, which in many Arabic dia lects means a village. This basin was doubtless thickly populated in ancient times, and Moslem historians mention its seven idols, repre senting the seven planets. 2 According to Mohammed the pebbles of the accepted are removed by angels ; as, however, each man and woman must throw 49 or 70 stones, it is fair to suspect the intervention of something more material. Animals are frightened away by the bustling crowd, and flies are found in myriads. 3 This demoniacal practice is still as firmly believed in Arabia as it formerly was in Europe.XXVIII.—Ceremonies of the Yanm Al-Tavwiyah. 181 ship, which savoured strongly of Stambul. After passing through the town, we came to Batn al-Muhassir, 'The Basin of the Troubler, 1 ' (Satan) at the beginning of a descent leading to Mnzdalifah (the Approacher), where the road falls into the valley of the Arafat torrent. At noon we reached the Muzdalifah, also called Mashar al-Haram, the 'Place dedicated to religious Ceremonies. 2 ' It is known in Al-Islam as 'the Minaret without the Mosque,' opposed to Masjid Nimrah, which is the ' Mosque without the Minaret.' Half-Way between Muna and Arafat, it is about three miles from both. There is something peculiarly striking in the distant ap pearance of the tall, solitary tower, rising abruptly from the desolate valley of gravel, flanked with buttresses of yellow rock. No wonder that the ancient Arabs loved to give the high-sounding name of this oratory to distant places in their giant Caliph-empire. Here as we halted to perform the mid-day prayer, we were overtaken by the Damascus Caravan. It was a grand spectacle. The Mahmil, no longer naked as upon the line of march, flashed in the sun all green and gold. Around the moving host of white-robed pilgrims hovered a crowd of Badawin, male and female, all mounted on swift dromedaries, and many of them armed to the teeth. As their drapery floated in the wind, and their faces were veiled with the 'Lisam,' it was frequently difficult to 1 Probably because here Satan appeared to tempt Adam, Abra ham, and Ishmael. The Qanoon e Islam erroneously calls it the ' Valley of Muhasurah,' and corrupts Mashar al-Haram into ' Muzar al-Haram ' (the holy shrine). 2 Many, even since Sale corrected the error, have confounded this Mashar s\-Haram with Masjid a.\-Hurum of Meccah. According to Al-Fasi, quoted by Burckhardt, it is the name of a little eminence at the end of the Muzdalifah valley, and anciently called Jabal Kuzah ; it is also, he says, applied to ' an elevated platform inclosing the mosque of Muzdalifah.' Ibn Jubayr makes Mashar al-Haram synony mous with Muzdalifah, to which he gives a third name, ' Jami.'182 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Mcccah. distinguish the sex of the wild being, flogging its animal turn to speed.

Nothing can be more sinful in Al-Islam 1 than such deed—it is murder, 44 made sicker ' by sacrilege; the yet the prevalence of the practice proves how feeble is the p a i a religion's hold upon the race.

Here the an d spurs of the rock limited the road to about a hundred thej paces, and it is generally a scene of great confusion. After this we arrived at Al-Bazan (the Basin), 2 a widening ^ of the plain ; and another half-hour brought us to the mai Alamayn (the 'Two Signs'), whitewashed pillars, or con . rather thin, narrow walls, surmounted with pinnacles, fyl], which denote the precincts of the Arafat plain.

At last, about three p.m ., we found a vacant space near the Matbakh, or kitchen, formerly belonging to a Sharif's palace, but now a ruin with a few shells of arches. Arafat is about six hours' very slow march, or twelve miles, 1 on the Taifroad, due east of Meccah. We arrived there in a shorter time, but our weary camels, during the last third of the way, frequently threw themselves upon the ground. Human beings suffered more. Between Muna and Arafat I saw no fewer than five men fall down and die upon the highway : exhausted and moribund, they had dragged themselves out to give up the ghost where it departs to instant beatitude. 3 The spectacle showed how easy it is to die in these latitudes 8 ; each man suddenly staggered, fell as if shot; and, after a brief convulsion, lay still as marble. The corpses were care fully taken up, and carelessly buried that same evening, in a vacant space amongst the crowds encamped upon the Arafat plain. 4 The boy Mohammed, who had long chafed at my per- 1 Mr. \V. Muir, in his valuable Life of Mahomet, vol. 1, p. ccv., remarks upon this passage that at p. 180 ante, I made Muna three miles from Meccah, and Muzdalifah about three miles from Muna, and Arafat three miles from Muzdalifah,—a total of nine. But the lesser estimate does not include the outskirts of Meccah on the breadth of the Arafat Plain. The Calcutta Review (art. 1, Sept. 1853) notably errs in making Arafat eighteen miles east of Meccah. Ibn Jubayr reckons five miles from Meccah to Muzdalifah, and five from this to Arafat. 2 Those who die on a pilgrimage become martyrs. 3 I cannot help believing that some unknown cause renders death easier to man in hot than in cold climates; certain it is that in Europe rare are the quiet and painless deathbeds so common in the East. 4 We bury our dead, to preserve them as it were; the Moslem tries to secure rapid decomposition, and makes the graveyard a dan gerous as well as a disagreeable place.Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. tinacious claim to Darwaysh-hood, resolved on this occa sion to be grand. To swell the party he had invited Omar Effendi, whom we accidentally met in the streets of Meccah, to join us : but failing therein, he brought with him two cousins, fat youths of sixteen and seventeen, and his mother's ground-floor servants. These were four Indians : an old man ; his wife, a middle-aged woman of the most ordinary appearance ; their son, a sharp boy, who spoke excellent Arabic 1 ; and a family friend, a stout fellow about thirty years old. They were Panjabis, and the bachelor's history was instructive. He was gaining an honest livelihood in his own country, when suddenly one night Hazrat Ali, dressed in green, and mounted upon his charger Duldul 2 —at least, so said the narrator—ap peared, crying in a terrible voice, ' How long wilt thou toil for this world, and be idle about the life to come ?' From that moment, like an English murderer, he knew no peace; Conscience and Hazrat Ali haunted him. 8 Find- 1 Arabs observe that Indians, unless brought young into the country, never learn its language well. They have a word to express the vicious pronunciation of a slave or an Indian, 'Barbaret al- Hunud.' This root Barbara like the Greek 'Barbaros,' appears to be derived from the Sanscrit Varvvaraha, an outcast, a barbarian, a man with curly hair. 2 Ali's charger was named Maymun, or, according to others, Zu'l Janah (the winged). Indians generally confound it with 'Dul dul,' Mohammed's mule. 3 These visions are common in history. Ali appeared to the Imam Shafe'i, saluted him,—an omen of eternal felicity,—placed a ring upon his finger, as a sign that his fame should extend wide as the donor's, and sent him to the Holy Land. Ibrahim bin Adham, the saint-poet hearing, when hunting, a voice exclaim, 'Man! it is not for this that Allah made thee!' answered, 'It is Allah who speaks, his servant will obey!' He changed clothes with an attendant, and wandered forth upon a pilgrimage, celebrated in Al-Islam. He per formed it alone, and making noo genuflexions each mile, prolonged it to twelve years.

Mr. Cole, when holding that appointment, informed me that, though men die of starvation in the streets, he was unable to relieve them. The highways of Meccah abound in pathetic Indian beggars, who affect lank bodies, shrinking frames, whi ning voices, and all the circumstance of misery, because it supports them in idleness. There are no fewer than fifteen hundred Indians at Meccah and Jeddah, besides seven or eight hundred in Al- Yaman. Such a body requires a Consul. 1 By the repre sentation of a Vice-Consul when other powers send an officer of superior rank to Al-Hijaz, we voluntarily place ourselves in an inferior position. And although the Meccan Sharif might for a time object to establishing a Moslem agent at the Holy City with orders to report to the Consul at Jeddah, his opposition would soon fall to the ground. With the Indians' assistance the boy Mohammed removed the handsome Persian rugs with which he had covered the Shugduf, pitched the tent, carpeted the ground, disposed a Diwan of silk and satin cushions round the interior, and strewed the centre with new Chi- buks, and highly polished Shishahs. At the doorway was placed a large copper fire-pan, with coffee-pots sing ing a welcome to visitors. In front of us were the litters, and by divers similar arrangements our establishment was made to look fine. The youth also insisted upon my removing the Rida, or upper cotton cloth, which had become way-soiled, and he supplied its place by a rich cashmere, left with him, some years before, by a son of the King of Delhi. Little thought I that this bravery of attire would lose me every word of the Arafat sermon next day.

The main street of tents and ape. booths, huts and shops, was bright with lanterns, and le la the bazars were crowded with people and stocked with ares all manner of Eastern delicacies. Some anomalous inah spectacles met the eye. Many pilgrims, especially the that soldiers, were in laical costume. In one place a half- : his drunken Arnaut stalked down the road, elbowing peaceful ivac passengers and frowning fiercely in hopes of a quarrel. In another part, a huge dimly-lit tent, reeking hot, and veil- garnished with cane seats, contained knots of Egyptians, iven as their red Tarbushes, white turbands, and black eval Za'abuts showed, noisily intoxicating themselves with pent forbidden hemp. There were frequent brawls and great n at confusion; many men had lost their parties, and, mixed ipon with loud Labbayks, rose the shouted names of women ig to as well as of men. I was surprised at the disproportion of ; its female nomenclature—the missing number of fair ones ther seemed to double that of the other sex—and at a practice so opposed to the customs of the Moslem world.

So the welkin rang with the indecent sounds of O Fatimah! O Zaynab! O Khayz'ran! 1 Plunderers, too, were abroad. As we returned to the tent we found a crowd assembled near it; a woman had seized a thief as he was beginning operations, and had the courage to hold his beard till men ran to her assistance. And we were obliged to defend by force our position against a knot of grave-diggers, who would bury a little heap of bodies within a yard or tvro of our tent. One point struck me at once—the difference in point of cleanliness between an encampment of citizens and of Badawin. Poor Mas'ud sat holding his nose in ineffable disgust, for which he was derided by the Meccans. I consoled him with quoting the celebrated song of May sunah, the beautiful Badawi wife of the Caliph Mu'a- wiyah. Nothing can be more charming in its own Arabic than this little song ; the Badawin never hear it withou' screams of joy. ' O take these purple robes away. Give back my cloak of camel's hair, And bear me from this tow'ring pile To where the Black Tents flap i' the air. The camel's colt with fait'ring tread, The dog that bays at all but me.

The morning of the ninth Zu'l Hijjah (Tuesday, 13th Sept.) was ushered in by military sounds: a loud discharge of cannon warned us to arise and to prepare for the cere monies of this eventful day. After ablution and prayer, I proceeded with the boy Mohammed to inspect the numerous consecrated sites on the 'Mountain of Mercy.' In the first place, we re paired to a spot on rising ground to the south-east, and within a hundred yards of the hill. It is called 'Jami al-Sakhrah 1 '—the Assembling Place of the Rock—from two granite boulders upon which the Prophet stood to perform 'Talbiyat.' There is nothing but a small en closure of dwarf and whitewashed stone walls, divided into halves for men and women by a similar partition, and pro- ^ vided with a niche to direct prayer to wards Meccah. Entering by steps, we found crowds of devotees and guardians, who for a consideration offered mats and carpets. After a two-bow prayer and a long supplication opposite the niche, we retired to the inner compartment, stood upon a boulder and shouted the ' Labbayk.' Thence, threading our way through many obstacles 1 Ali Bey calls it ' Jami al-Rahmah'—of mercy.XXIX.—Ceremonies of the Yaum Arafat. 193 of tent and stone, we ascended the broad flight of rugged steps which winds up the southern face of the rocky hill. Even at this early hour it was crowded with pilgrims, principally Badawin and Wahhabis, who had secured favourable positions for hearing the sermon. Already their green flag was planted upon the summit close to Adam's Place of Prayer. The wilder Arabs insist that 'Wukuf' (standing) should take place upon the Hill. This is not done by tke more civilised, who hold that all the plain within the Alamayn ranks as Arafat. Accord- ing to Ali Bey, the Maliki school is not allowed to stand upon the mountain. About half way up I counted sixty- six steps, and remarked that they became narrower and steeper. Crowds of beggars instantly seized the pilgrims' robes, and strove to prevent our entering a second enclo sure. This place, which resembles the former, except that it has but one compartment and no boulders, is that whence Mohammed used to address his followers; and here, to the present day, the Khatib, or preacher, in imitation of the ' Last of the Prophets,' sitting upon a dromedary, recites the Arafat sermon. Here, also, we prayed a two-bow prayer, and gave a small sum to the guardian. Thence ascending with increased difficulty to the hill top, we arrived at a large stuccoed platform, 1 with prayer- niche and a kind of obelisk, mean and badly built of lime and granite stone, whitewashed, and conspicuous from afar. It is called the Makam, or Mada'a Sayyidna Adam. 3 Here we performed the customary ceremonies amongst a cr owd o f pilgrims, and then we walked down the little hill. 1 Here was a small chapel, which the Wahhabis were demolishing when Ah Bey was at Meccah. It has not been rebuilt. Upon this spot the Prophet, according to Burckhardt, used to stand during the ceremonies. 2 Burckhardt gives this name to a place a little way on the left and about forty steps up the mountain. vol. 11. 13194 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Close to the plain we saw the place where the Egyptian and Damascus Mahmils stand during the sermon ; and, descending the wall that surrounds Arafat by a steep and narrow flight of coarse stone steps, we found on our right the fountain which supplies the place with water. It bubbles from the rock, and is exceedingly pure, as such water generally is in Al-Hijaz. Our excursion employed us longer than the descrip tion requires—nine o'clock had struck before we reached the plain. All were in a state of excitement. Guns fired incessantly. Horsemen and camel-riders galloped about without apparent object. Even the women and the chil dren stood and walked, too restless even to sleep. Arrived at the tent, I was unpleasantly surprised to find a new visitor in an old acquaintance, Ali ibn Ya Sin the Zern- zemi. He had lost his mule, and, wandering in search of its keepers, he unfortunately fell in with our party. I had solid reasons to regret the mishap—he was far too curious and too observant to suit my tastes. On the present occasion, he, being uncomfortable, made us equally so. Accustomed to all the terrible 'neatness' of an elderly damsel in Great Britain, a few specks of dirt upon the rugs, and half a dozen bits of cinder upon the ground, sufficed to give him attacks of 'nerves.' That day we breakfasted late, for night must come before we could eat again. After mid-day prayer we per formed ablutions; some the greater, others the less, in preparation for the 'Wukuf,' or Standing. From noon onwards the hum and murmur of the multitude increased, and people were seen swarming about in all directions. A second discharge of cannon (at about 3.15 p.m.) announced the approach of Al-Asr, the afternoon prayei, and almost immediately we heard the Naubat, or bani preceding the Sharif's procession, as he wended his way towards the mountain.

After the chargers paraded a band of black slaves on foot bearing huge matchlocks; and immediately preceded by three green and two red flags, came the Sharif, riding in front of his family and courtiers. The prince, habited in a simple white Ihram, and bare-headed, mounted a mule; the only sign of his rank was a large green and gold embroidered umbrella, held over him by a slave. The rear was brought up by another troop of Badawin on horses and camels. Behind this procession were the tents, whose doors and walls were scarcely visible for the crowd; and the picturesque background was the granite hill, covered, wherever standing-room was to be found, with white-robed pilgrims shouting 'Labbayk,' and waving the skirts of their glistening garments violently over their heads. Slowly and solemnly the procession advanced towards the hill. Exactly at the hour Al-Asr, the two Mahmils had taken their station side by side on a platform in the lower slope. That of Damascus could be distinguished as the narrower and the more ornamented of the pair. The Sharif placed himself with his standard-bearers and his retinue a little above the Mahmils, within hearing of the preacher. The pilgrims crowded up to the foot of the mountain : the loud ' Labbayk' of the Badawin and with the utmost contempt of the African horse. In India we now depend for Arab blood upon the Persian Gulf, and the consequences of monopoly display themselves in an increased price for inferior animals. Our studs are generally believed to be sinks for rupees. The Governments of India now object, it is said, to rearing, at a great cost, animals distinguished by nothing but ferocity. It is evident that Al-Hijaz never can stock the Indian market. Whether Al-Nijd will supply us when the transit becomes safer, is a considera tion which time only can decide. Meanwhile it would be highly advisable to take steps for restoring the Aden trade by entering into closer relations with the Imam of Sana'a and the Badawi chiefs in the North of Al-Yaman.XXIX.—Ceremonies of the Yaum Arafat. 197 Wahhabis 1 fell to a solemn silence, and the waving of white robes ceased—a sign that the preacher had begun the Khutbat al-\\ akfah, or Sermon of the Standing (upon Arafat). From my tent I could distinguish the form of the old man upon his camel, but the distance was too great for ear to reach. But how came I to be at the tent ? A short confession will explain. They will shrive me who believe in inspired Spenser's lines— ' And every spirit, as it is more pure, And hath in it the more of heavenly light, So it the fairer body doth procure To habit in.' The evil came of a ' fairer body.' I had prepared en cachette a slip of paper, and had hid in my Ihram a pencil destined to put down the heads of this rarely heard dis course. But unhappily that red cashmere shawl was upon my shoulders. Close to us sat a party of fair Meccans, apparently belonging to the higher classes, and one of these I had already several times remarked. She was a tall girl, about eighteen years old, with regular features, a skin somewhat citrine-coloured, but soft and clear, symmetrical eyebrows, the most beautiful eyes, and a figure all grace. There was no head thrown back, no straightened neck, no flat shoulders, nor toes turned out— in fact, no ' elegant ' barbarisms : the shape was what the Arabs love, soft, bending, and rel axed, as a woman's 1 I obtained the following note upon the ceremonies of Wah- habi pilgrimage from one of their princes, Khalid Bey:—The Wahhabi (who, it must be borne in mind, calls himself a Muwahhid, or Unitarian, in opposition to Mushrik—Polytheist—any other sect but his own) at Meccah follows out his two principal tenets, public prayer for men daily, for women on Fridays, and rejection of the Prophet's mediation. Imitating Mohammed, he spends the first night of pilgrimage at Muna, stands upon the hill Arafat, and, returning to Muna, passes three whole days there. He derides other Moslems, abridges and simplifies the Ka'abah ceremonies, and, if possible, is guided in his devotions by one of his own sect.ig8 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Mcccah. figure ought to be. Unhappily she wore, instead of the usual veil, a ' Yashmak ' of transparent muslin, bound round the face ; and the chaperone, mother, or duenna, by whose side she stood, was apparently a very unsus picious or complaisant old person. Flirtilla fixed a glance of admiration upon my cashmere. I directed a reply with interest at her eyes. She then by the usual coquettish gesture, threw back an inch or two of head-veil, disclos ing broad bands of jetty hair, crowning a lovely oval. My palpable admiration of the new charm was rewarded by a partial removal of the Yashmak, when a dimpled mouth and a rounded chin stood out from the envious muslin. Seeing that my companions were safely employed, I entered upon the dangerous ground of raising hand to forehead. She smiled almost imperceptibly, and turned away. The pilgrim was in ecstasy. The sermon was then half over. I was resolved to stay upon the plain and see what Flirtilla would do. Grace to the cashmere, we came to a good understanding. The next page will record my disappointment—that even ing the pilgrim resumed his soiled cotton cloth, and testily returned the red shawl to the boy Mohammed. The sermon always lasts till near sunset, or about three hours. At first it was spoken amid profound silence. Then loud, scattered ' Amins ' (Amens) and volleys of ' Labbayk ' exploded at uncertain intervals At last the breeze brought to our ears a purgatorial chorus of cries, sobs, and shrieks. Even my party thought proper to be affected : old Ali rubbed his eyes, which in no case un connected with dollars could by any amount of straining be made to shed even a crocodile's tear ; and the boy Mohammed wisely hid his face in the skirt of his Rida. Presently the people, exhausted by emotion, began to descend the hill in small parties; and those below struck their tents and commenced loading their camels, although at least an hour's sermon remained.

The pilgrims, «« swaying to and fro, tish Like waves of a great sea, that in mid shock los- Confound each other, white with foam and fear,' rushed down the hill with a 'Labbayk' sounding like a ^ blast, and took the road to Muna. Then I saw the scene which has given to this part of the ceremonies the name ous of Al-Dafa min Arafat, — the 'Hurry from Arafat.' re d» Every man urged his beast with might and main: it was ^ to sunset; the plain bristled with tent-pegs, litters were ne ^ crushed, pedestrians were trampled, camels were over thrown: single combats with sticks and other weapons ' took place; here a woman, there a child, and there an ^ 0 ' animal were lost; briefly, it was a chaotic confusion. To my disgust, old Ali insisted upon bestowing his en ' company upon me. He gave over his newly found mule an ^ to the boy Mohammed, bidding him take care of the beast, and mounted with me in the Shugduf. I had per- iree suaded Shaykh Mas'ud, with a dollar, to keep close in lce - rear of the pretty Meccan; and I wanted to sketch the 5 Holy Hill. The senior began to give orders about the t ^ e camel—I, counter-orders. The camel was halted. I ies » urged it on; old Ali directed it to be stopped. Meanwhile &gt; the charming face that smiled at me from the litter grew un ' dimmer and dimmer; the more I stormed, the less I was im g listened to—a string of camels crossed our path—I lost ho y sight of the beauty. Then we began to advance. Again, my ida. determination to sketch seemed likely to fail before the Zemzemi's little snake's eye. After a few minutes' angry uc ^ search for expedients, one suggested itself. 'Effendi!' said old Ali, 'sit quiet; there is danger here.' I tossed about like one suffering from evil conscience or from the2oo Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and, Meccah. colic. 'Effendi!' shrieked the senior, 'what art thou - „ ^ doing?

In the ecstasy ofk^ fear my tormentor turned his face, as he was bidden, towards the camel's head. A second halt ensued, when &lt; eac j 1 I looked out of the aperture in rear, and made a rough n - drawing of the Mountain of Mercy. At the Akhshabayn, double lines of camels, bristling j iainr with litters, clashed with a shock more noisy than the ^ un , meeting of torrents. It was already dark ; no man knew what he was doing.

Before sleeping each man collected for himself seven 'Jamrah'—bits of granite the size of a small bean. 4 Then, weary with emotion and exertion, all lay down except the boy Mo hammed, who preceded us to find encamping ground at Muna. Old Ali, in lending his mule, made the most stringent arrrangements with the youth about the exact place and the exact hour of meeting—an act of simplicity at which I could not but smile. The night was by no means peaceful or silent. Lines of camels passed us every ten minutes, and the shouting of travellers con tinued till near dawn. Pilgrims ought to have nighted at the Mosque, but, as in Burckhardt's time, so in mine, baggage was considered to be in danger thereabouts, and consequently most of the devotees spent the sermon-hours in brooding over their boxes. 1 Hanafis usually follow the Prophet's example in nighting at Muzdalifah; in the evening after prayers they attend at the Mosque, listen to the discourse, and shed plentiful tears. Most Shafe'is spend only a few hours at Muzdalifah. 2 We failed to buy meat at Arafat, after noon, although the bazar was large and well stocked ; it is usual to eat flesh there, consequently it is greedily bought up at an exorbitant price. 3 Some sects consider the prayer at Muzdalifah a matter of vital importance. 4 Jamrah is a ' small pebble;' it is also called *• Hasa,' in the plural, ' Hasayat.' theCHAPTER XXX. the ceremonies of the yaum nahr, or the third day. A t dawn on the Id al-Kurban(ioth Zu 'l Hijjah, Wednes day, 14th September) a gun warned us to lose no time; we arose hurriedly, and started up the Batn Muhassir to Muna. By this means we lost at Muzdalifah the 'Salat al-fd,' or 'Festival Prayers,' the great solemnity of the Moslem year, performed by all the community at day break. My companion was so anxious to reach Meccah, that he would not hear of devotions. About eight a.m. we entered the village, and looked for the boy Mohammed in vain. Old Ali was dreadfully perplexed; a host of high-born Turkish pilgrims were, he said, expecting him; his mule was missing—could never appear—he must be late—should probably never reach Meccah—what would become of him ? I began by administering admonition to the mind diseased; but signally failing in a cure, I amused myself with contemplating the world from my Shugduf, leaving the office of directing it to the old Zemzemi. Now he stopped, then he pressed forward; here he thought he saw Mohammed, there he discovered our tent; at one time he would ' nakh ' the camel to await, in patience, his supreme hour; at another, half mad with nervous ness, he would urge the excellent Mas'ud to hopeless inquiries. Finally, by good fortune, we found one of the boy Mohammed's cousins, who led us to an enclosureXXX.—Ceremonies of the Yawn Nahr. 203 called Hosh al-Uzam, in the Southern portion of the Muna Basin, at the base of Mount Sabir. 1 There we pitched the tent, refreshed ourselves, and awaited the truant's return. Old Ali, failing to disturb my equanimity, attempted, as those who consort with philosophers often will do, to quarrel with me. But, finding no material wherewith to build a dispute in such fragments as 'Ah!'— 'Hem!'—'Wallah!' he hinted desperate intentions against the boy Mohammed. When, however, the youth appeared, with even more jauntiness of mien than usual, Ali bin Ya Sin lost heart, brushed by him, mounted his mule, and, doubtless cursing us 'under the tongue,' rode away, frowning viciously, with his heels playing upon the beast's ribs. Mohammed had been delayed, he said, by the diffi culty of finding asses. We were now to mount for 'the Throwing, 2 ' as a preliminary to which we washed ' with seven waters ' the seven pebbles brought from Muzdalifah, and bound them in our Ihrams. Our first destination was the entrance to the western end of the long line which composes the Muna village. We found a swarming crowd in the narrow road opposite the 'Jamrat al-Akabah, 8 ' or, as it is vulgarly called, theShaytan al-Kabir—the 'Great Devil.' These names distinguish it from another pillar, the ' Wusta, ' or 'Central Place,' (of stoning,) built in the middle of Muna, and a third at the eastern end, 'Al- Aula,' or the 'First Place. 4 ' The ' Shaytan al-Kab ir' is a dwarf buttress of rude 1 Even pitching ground here is charged to pilgrims. 2 Some authorities advise that this rite of ' Ramy ' be performed on foot. 3 Ihe word ' Jamrah ' is applied to the place of stoning, as well as to the stones. 4 1 hese numbers mark the successive spots where the Devil, in m the shape of an old Shaykh, appeared to Adam, Abraham, and s mael, and was driven back by the simple process taught by Gabriel, ot throwing stones about the size of a bean.204 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. masonry, about eight feet high' by two and a half broad, placed against a rough wall of stones at the Meccan entrance to Muna. As the ceremony of 'Ramy,' or Lapidation, must be performed on the first diiy by all pilgrims between sunrise and sunset, and as the fiend was malicious enough to appear in [a rugged Pass, 1 the crowd makes the place dangerous. On one side of the road, which is not forty feet broad, stood a row of shops belong ing principally to barbers. On the other side is the rugged wall against which the pillar stands, with a chevaux defrise of Badawin and naked boys. The narrow space was crowded with pilgrims, all struggling like drowning men to approach as near as possible to the Devil; it would have been easy to run over the heads of the mass. Amongst them were horsemen with rearing chargers. Badawin on wild camels, and grandees on mules and asses, with out runners, were breaking a way by assault and battery. I had read Ali Bey's self-felicitations upon escaping this place with 'only two wounds in the left leg,' and I had duly provided myself with a hidden dagger. The precaution was not useless. Scarcely had my donkey entered the crowd than he was overthrown by a drome dary, and I found myself under the stamping and roaring beast's stomach. Avoiding being trampled upon by a judicious use of the knife, I lost no time in escaping from a place so ignobly dangerous. Some Moslem travellers assert, in proof of the sanctity of the spot, that no Mos lem is ever killed here: Meccans assured me that accidents are by no means rare. Presently the boy Mohammed fought his way out of the crowd with a bleeding nose. We both sat down upon ^jsubench before a barber's booth, and, schooled by ad- i I borrow this phrase from Ali Bey, who, however, speaks more like an ignorant Catalonian than a learned Abbaside, when he calls the pillar 'LaMaisondu Diable,' and facetiously asserts that ' le diable a eu la malice de placer sa maison dans un lieu fort etroit qui n'a peut-etre pas 34 pieds de large.'XXX.—Ceremonies of the Yami Nahr. 205 versity, awaited with patience an opportunity. Finding an opening, we approached within about five cubits of the place, and holding each stone between the thumb and the forefinger 1 of the right hand, we cast it at the pillar, exclaiming, 'In the name of Allah, and Allah is Al mighty! (I do this) in Hatred of the Fiend and to his Shame.' After which came the Tahlil and the 'Sana,' or praise to Allah. The seven stones being duly thrown, we retired, and entering the barber's booth, took our places upon one of the earthern benches around it. This was the time to remove the Ihram or pilgrim's garb, and to return to Ihlal, the normal state of Al-Islam. The barber shaved our heads, 2 and, after trimming our beards and cutting our nails, made us repeat these words: 'I purpose loosening my Ihram according to the Practice of the Prophet, Whom may Allah bless and preserve! O Allah, make unto me in every Hair, a Light, a Purity, and a generous Reward! In the name of Allah, and Allah is Almighty!' At the conclusion of his labour, the barber politely addressed to us a 'Na'iman—Pleas ure to you!' To which we as ceremoniously replied, 'Allah give thee pleasure!' We had no clothes with us, but we could use our cloths to cover our heads, and slippers to defend our feet from the fiery sun; and we now could safely twirl our mustachios and stroke our beards placid enj oyments of which we had been deprived by the 1 Some hold the pebble as a schoolboy does a marble, others between the thumb and forefinger extended, others shoot them from the thumb knuckle, and most men consult their own convenience. 2 The barber removed all my hair. Hanifis shave at least a quarter of the head, Shafe'is a few hairs on the right side. The prayer is, as usual, differently worded, some saying, •' O Allah this my Forelock is in Thy Hand, then grant me for every Hair a Light on Resurrection-day, by Thy Mercy O most Merciful of the Merciful!' I remarked that the hair was allowed to lie upon the ground, whereas strict Moslems, with that reverence for man's body—the Temple of the Supreme—which characterizes their creed, carefully bury it in the earth.206 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Laws of Pilgrimage. After resting about an hour in the booth, which, though crowded with sitting customers, was delightfully cool compared with the burning glare of the road, we mounted our asses, and at eleven a.m . we started Meccah-wards. This return from Muna to Meccah is called Al-Nafr, or the Flight 1 : we did not fail to keep our asses at speed, with a few halts to refresh ourselves with gugglets of water. There was nothing remarkable in the scene: ou: ride in was a repetition of our ride out. In about half an hour we entered the city, passing through that classica; locality called 'Batn Kuraysh,' which was crowded with people, and then we repaired to the boy Mohammed's house for the purpose of bathing and preparing to visit the Ka'abah. Shortly after our arrival, the youth returned home in a state of excitement, exclaiming, ' Rise, Effendi! dress and follow me!' The Ka'abah, though open, would for a time be empty, so that we should escape the crowd. My pilgrim's garb, which had not been removed, was made to look neat and somewhat Indian, and we sallied forth together without loss of time. A crowd had gathered round the Ka'abah, and I had no wish to stand bareheaded and barefooted in the mid day September sun. At the cry of 'Open a path for the Haji who would enter the House,' the gazers made way Two stout Meccans, who stood below the door, raised me in their arms, whilst a third drew me from above into the building. At the entrance I was accosted by several officials, dark-looking Meccans, of whom the blackest and plainest was a youth of the Benu Shaybah family,' 1 This word is confounded with 'Dafa' by many Moslem authors. Some speak of the Nafr from Arafat to Muzdalifah and the Da/a from Muzdalifah to Muna. I have used the words as my Mutawwif used them. 2 They keep the keys of the House.

He held in his hand the hugs silver-gilt padlock of the Ka'abah, 1 and presently taking his seat upon a kind of wooden press in the left corner of the hall, he officially inquired my name, nation, and other particulars. The replies were satisfactory, and the boy Mohammed was authoritatively ordered to con duct me round the building, and to recite the prayers. I will not deny that, looking at the windowless walls, the officials at the door, and the crowd of excited fanatics below— 'And the place death, considering who I was,' 8 my feelings were of the trapped-rat description, acknow ledged by the immortal nephew of his uncle Perez. This did not, however, prevent my carefully observing the scene during our long prayers, and making a rough plan with a pencil upon my white Ihram. Nothing is more simple than the interior of this celebrated building. The pavement, which is level with the ground, is composed of slabs of fine and various col oured marbles, mostly, however, white, disposed chequer wise. The walls, as far as they can be seen, are of the same material, but the pieces are irregularly shaped, and many of them are engraved with long inscriptions in the Suls and other modern characters. The upper part of the walls, together with the ceiling, at which it is con- sidered disrespectful to look, 8 are cover ed with handsome X In Ibn Jubayr's time this large padlock was of gold. It is said popularly that none but the Benu Shaybah can open it; a minor miracle, doubtless proceeding from the art of some Eastern Hobbs or Bramah. 2 However safe a Christian might be at Meccah, nothing could preserve him from the ready knives of enraged fanatics if detected in the House. The very idea is pollution to a Moslem. 3 I do not known the origin of this superstition; but it would be unsafe for a pilgrim to look fixedly at the Ka'abah ceiling. Under the arras I was told is a strong planking of Saj, or Indian teak, and above it a stuccoed Sath, or flat roof.208 Pilgrimage to Al-MadimJt and Meccah. red damask, flowered over with gold, 1 and tucked up about six feet high, so as to be removed from pilgrims' hands. The flat roof is upheld by three cross-beams, whose shapes appear under the arras; they rest upon the eastern and western walls, and are supported in the centre by three columns 2 about twenty inches in diameter, covered with carved and ornamented aloes wood. 8 At the Iraki corner c 9 9 9 e »• 9 b b ' » A plan of ka'abah. 1 1.

The ' Aswad ' or 1 Exactly realising the description of our English bard:— 'Goodly arras of great majesty, Woven with gold and silk so close and nere, That the rich metal lurked privily, As feigning to be hid from envious eye.' 2 Ibn Jubayr mentions three columns of teak.

Generally the pillars have been three it number. 3 This wood, which has been used of old to ornament sacrec buildings in the East, is brought to Meccah in great quantities bj Malay and Java pilgrims.

Between the columns, and about nine feet from the ground, ran bars of a metal which I could not distinguish, and hanging to them were many lamps, said to be of gold. Although there were in the Ka'abah but a few at tendants engaged in preparing it for the entrance of pilgrims, 4 the windowless stone walls and the choked-up door made it worse than the Piombi of Venice ; perspir ation trickled in large drops, and I thought with horror what it must be when filled with a mass of furiously jost ling and crushing fanatics. Our devotions consisted of a two-bow prayer, 5 followed by long supplications at the Shami (West) corner, the Iraki (north) angle, the Yamani (south), and, lastly, opposite the southern third of the back wall. 6 These concluded, I returned to the door, where payment is made. The boy Mohammed told me that the total expense would be seven dollars. At the same time he had been indulging aloud in his favourite rhodomontade, boasting of my greatness, and had declared me to be an Indian pilgrim, a ra ce still supposed at 1 The Hajar al-Aswad is also called Al-As'ad, or the Propitious. 2 Here, in Ibn Jubayr's time, stood two boxes full of Korans. 3 The key is sometimes placed in the hands of a child of the house of Shaybah, who sits in state, with black slaves on both sides. 4 In Ibn Jubayr's day the Ka'abah was opened with more cere mony. The ladder was rolled up to the door, and the chief of the Benu Shaybah, ascending it, was covered by attendants with a black veil from head to foot, whilst he opened the padlock. Then, having kissed the threshold, he entered, shut the door behind him, and prayed two Rukats; after which, all the Benu Shaybah, and, lastly, the vulgar were admitted. In these day the veil is obsolete. The Shaykh enters the Ka'abah alone, perfumes it and prays; the pilgrims are then admitted en masse; and the style in which the eunuchs handle their quarter-staves forms a scene more animated than decorous, 5 Some pray four instead of two bows. Burckhardt erroneously says, 'in every corner '■ vol. 11. j 142io Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Meccah to be made of gold. 1 When seven dollars were tendered, they were rejected with instance. Expecting something of the kind, I had been careful to bring no more than eight. Being pulled and interpellated by half a dozen attendants, my course was to look stupid, and to pretend ignorance of the language. Presently the Shay- bah youth bethought him of a contrivance. Drawing forth from the press the key of the Ka'abah, he partly bared it of its green-silk gold-lettered etui? and rubbed a golden knob quartrefoil-shaped upon my eyes, in order to brighten them. I submitted to the operation with a good grace, and added a dollar—my last—to the former offering. The Sharif received it with a hopeless glance, and, to my satisfaction, would not put forth his hand to be kissed. Then the attendants began to demand vails. I replied by opening my empty pouch. When let down from the door by the two brawny Meccans, I was expected to pay them, and accordingly appointed to meet them at the boy Mohammed's house; an arrangement to which they grumblingly assented. Wben delivered from these troubles, I was congratulated by my sharp companion thus: ' Wallah, Effendi! thou hast escaped well! some men have left their skins behind. 8 ' 1 These Indians are ever in extremes, paupers or millionaires, and, like all Moslems, the more they pay at Meccah the higher be comes their character and religious titles.

It is of silk, embroidered witi golden letters, and upon it are written the Bismillah, the name of th« reigning Sultan, 'Bag of the key of the holy Ka'abah,' and » verselet from the 'Family of Amran' (Koran, ch. 3).

Omar Effendi, for instance, who never missed a pilgrimage, had never seen the interior. 2 Those who tread the hallowed floor are bound, among many other things, never again to walk barefooted, to take up fire with the fingers, or to tell lies. Most really conscientious men cannot afford the luxuries of slippers, tongs, and truth. So thought Thomas, when offered the apple which would give him the tongue which cannot lie:— '' My tongue is mine ain,' true Thomas said. ' A gudely gift ye wad gie to me 1 I neither dought to buy nor sell At fair or tryst, where I may be, I dought neither speak to prince or peer, Nor ask of grace from fair ladye 1' ' Amongst the Hindus I have met with men who have proceeded upon a pilgrimage to Dwarka, and yet who would not receive the brand of the god, because lying would then be forbidden to them. A confidential servant of a friend in Bombay naively declared that he had not been marked, as the act would have ruined him. There is a sad truth in what he said : Lying to the Oriental is meat and drink, and the roof that shelters him. The Ka'abah had been dressed in her new attire when we entered. 8 The covering, however, instead of being i The same is the case at Al-Madinah ; many religious men object on conscientious grounds to enter the Prophet's mosque.

It was of a brilliant black, and the Hizam—the zone or golden band running round the upper portion of the building—as well as the Burka (face-veil), were of dazzling brightness. The origin of this custom must be sought in the ancient practice of typifying the church visible by a \ irgin The Ka'abah in its new covering. or bride. The poet Abd al-Rahim al Bura'i, in one of his Gnostic effusions, has embodied the idea :— ' And Meccah's bride {i.e. the Ka'abah) is displayed with (miraculous) signs.' This idea doubtless led to the face-veil, the covering, and the guardianship of eunuchs. The Meccan temple was first dressed as a mark ol unclothed, the Ka'abah is called Uryanah (naked), in opposition to its normal state, •' Muhramah,' or clad in Ihram. In Burckhardt s time the house remained naked for fifteen days ; now the investiture is effected in a few hours. i The gold-embroidered curtain covering the Ka'abah door is called by the learned •' Burka al-Ka'abah ' (the Ka'abah's face-veil), by the vulgar Burka Fatimah ; they connect it in idea with the Prophet £ daughter.XXX. — Ceremonies of the Yawn Nahr. 213 honour by Tobba the Himyarite when he Judaized. 1 If we accept this fact, which is vouched for by Oriental history, we are led to the conclusion that the children of Israel settled at Meccah had connected the temple with their own faith, and, as a corollary, that the prophet of Al- Islam introduced their apocryphal traditions into his creed. The pagan Arabs did not remove the coverings : the old and torn Kiswah was covered with a new cloth, and the weight threatened to crush the building. 8 From the time of Kusay, the Ka'abah was veiled by subscription, till Abu Rabi'at al-Mughayrah bin Abdullah, who, having acquired great wealth by commerce, offered to provide the Kiswah on alternate years, and thereby gained the name of Al -Adil. The Prophet preferred a covering of fine Yaman cloth, and directed the expense to be defrayed by the Bayt al-Mal, or public treasury. Omar chose Egyp tian linen, ordering the Kiswah to be renewed every year, and the old covering to be distributed among the pilgrims. In the reign of Osman, the Ka'abah was twice clothed, in winter and summer. For the former season, it received a Kamis, or Tobe (shirt) of brocade ; with an Izar, or veil: for the latter a suit of fine linen. Mu'awiyah at first sup plied linen and brocade; he afterwards exchanged the former for striped Yaman stuff, and ordered Shaybah bin Osman to strip the Ka'abah and to perfume the walls with Khaluk. Shaybah divided the old Kiswah among the pilgrims, and Abdullah bin Abbas did not object to this distribution. 8 The Caliph Ma'amun (9th century) ordered 1 The pyramids, it is said, were covered from base to summit with yellow silk or satin. 2 At present the Kiswah, it need scarcely be said, does not cover the flat roof. 3 Ayishah also, when Shaybah proposed to bury the old Kiswah, that it might not be worn by the impure, directed him to sell it, and to distribute the proceeds to the poor. The Meccans still follow the rst half, but neglect the other part of the order given by the ' Mother o the Moslems.' Kazi Khan advises the proceeds of the sale being214 Pilgrimage to Al-Madimh and Meccah. the dress to be changed three times a year. In his day it was red brocade on the 10th Muharram ; fine linen on the ist Rajab ; and white brocade on the ist Shawwal. At last he was informed that the veil applied on the 10th of Muharram was too closely followed by the red brocade in the next month, and that it required renewing on the ist of Shawwal. This he ordered to be done. Al- Mutawakkil (ninth century), when informed that the dress was spoiled by pilgrims, at first ordered two to be given and the brocade shirt to be let down as far as the pave ment : at last he sent a new veil every two months. During the Caliphat of the Abbasides this investiture came to signify sovereignty in Al-Hijaz, which passed alternately from Baghdad to Egypt and Al-Yaman. In Al-Idrisi's time (twelth century a.d .) the Kiswah was com posed of black silk, and renewed every year by the Caliph of Baghdad. Ibn Jubayr writes that it was green and gold. The Kiswah remained with Egypt when Sultan Kalaun 1 (thirteenth century a.d .) conveyed the rents of two villages, 'Baysus' and 'Sindbus, 2 ' to the expense of providing an outer black and an inner red curtain for the Ka'abah, with hangings for the Prophet's tomb at Al- Madinah. When the Holy Land fell under the power of Osmanli, Sultan Salim ordered the Kiswah to be black; and his son Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent (sixteenth devoted to the repairs of the temple. The ' Siraj al-Wahhaj ' posi tively forbids, as sinful, the cutting, transporting, selling, buying, and placing it between the leaves of the Koran. Kutb al-Din (from whom I borrow these particulars) introduces some fine and casuistic distinc tions. In his day, however, the Benu Shaybah claimed the old, after the arrival of the new Kiswah ; and their right to it was admitted. To the present day they continue to sell it. 1 Some authors also mention a green Kiswah, applied by this monarch. Embroidered on it were certain verselets of the Koran, the formula of the Moslem faith, and the names of the Prophet's Com panions. 2 Burckhardt says ' Bysous ' and ' Sandabeir.'XXX.—Ceremonies of the Yaum Nahr. 215 century a.d .), devoted considerable sums to the purpose. The Kiswah was afterwards renewed at the accession of each Sultan. And the Wahhabis, during the first year of their conquest, covered the Ka'abah with a red Kiswah of the same stuff as the fine Arabian Aba or cloak, and made at Al-Hasa. The Kiswah is now worked at a cotton manufactory called Al-Khurunfish, of the Tumn Bab al-Sha'ariyah, Cairo. It is made by a hereditary family, called the Bayt al-Sadi, and, as the specimen in my possession proves, it is a coarse tissue of silk and cotton mixed. The Kiswah is composed of eight pieces—two for each face of the Ka'ab ah—the seams being concealed by the Hizam, a broad band, which at a distance looks like gold; it is lined with white calico, and is supplied with cotton ropes. An ciently it is said all the Koran was interwoven into it. Now, it is inscribed 'Verily, the First of Houses founded for Mankind (to worship in) is that at Bekkah 1 ; blessed and a Direction to all Creatures'; together with seven chapters, namely, the Cave, Madam, the Family of Am- ran, Repentance, T.H. with Y.S. and Tabarak. The character is that called Tumar, the largest style of East ern calligraphy, legible from a considerable distance. 2 The Hizam is a band about two feet broad, and sur rounding the Ka'abah at two-thirds of its height. It is divided into four pieces, which are sewn together. On the first and second is inscribed the 'Throne verslet,' and on the third and fourth the titles of the reigning Sultan. These inscriptions are, like theBurka, or door curtain, gold worked into red silk, by the Bayt al-Sadi. When the Kiswah is ready at Khurunfish, it is carried in 1 From the 'Family of Amran' (chap. 3). 'Bekkah' is 'a piace of crowding'; hence applied to Meccah generally.

Parties of Takruri might be seen sitting vulture-like, contemplating the sheep and goats; and no sooner was the signal given, than they fell upon the bodies, and cut them up without removing them.

A ll was dull after the excitement of the Great Fes tival. The heat of the succeeding night rendered every effort to sleep abortive; and as our little camp required a guard in a place so celebrated for plunderers, I spent the greater part of the time sitting in the clear pure moon light. 1 After midnight we again repaired to the Devils, and, beginning with the Ula, or first pillar, at the Eastern extremity of Muna, threw at each, seven stones (making a a total of twenty-one), with the ceremonies before de scribed. On Thursday (Sept. 15th, 1853), we arose before dawn, and prepared with a light breakfast for the fatigues of a climbing walk. After half an hour spent in hopping from boulder to boulder, we arrived at a place situated on the lower declivity of the Jabal Sabir, the northern wall of the Muna basin. Here is the Majarr al-Kabsh, ' the Dragging- place of the Ram,' a small, whitewashed square, divided 1 It is not safe to perform this ceremony at an early hour, although the ritual forbids it being deferred after sunset. A crowd of women, however, assembled at the Devils in the earlier part of the nth night (our 10th) : and these dames, despite the oriental modesty of face-veils, attack a stranger with hands and stones as heartily as English hop-gatherers hasten to duck the Acteon who falls in their way. Hence, popular usage allows stones to be thrown by men until the morning prayers of the nth Zu'l Hijjah.220 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinnh and Meccah. into two compartments. The first is entered by a few ragged steps in the south-east angle, which lead to an enclosure thirty feet by fifteen. In the north-east corner is a block of granite ( a ), in which a huge gash, several inches broad, some feet deep, and completely splitting the stone in knife-shape, notes the spot where Ibrahim's blade fell when the archangel Ga briel forbade him to slay Ismail his son. The second compartment contains a diminutive hypogaeum ( b ). In this cave the patriarch sacrificed the victim, which gives the place a name. We descended by a flight of steps, and under the stifling ledge of rock found mats and praying-rugs, which, at this early hour, were not overcrowded. We followed the example of the patriarchs, and prayed a two-bow prayer in each of the enclosures. After distributing the usual gratification, we left the place, and proceeded to mount the hill, in hope of seeing some of the apes said still to haunt the heights. These animals are supposed by the Meccans to have been Jews, thus transformed for having broken the Sabbath by hunting. 1 They abound in the elevated regions about Arafat and Taif, where they are caught by mixing the juice of the Asclepias and narcotics with dates and other sweet bait. 2 The Hijazi ape is a hideous cynocephalus, with small eyes placed close together, and almost hidden by a disproportionate snout; a greenish-brown coat, lonj arms, and a stern of lively pink, like fresh meat. Thej 1 Traditions about these animals vary in the different parts o Arabia. At Aden, for instance, they are supposed to be a remnant o the rebellious tribe of 'Ad. It is curious that the popular Arabic, lik( the Persian names, Sa'adan, Maymun, Shadi, &amp;c., &amp;c., are allexprcs sive of (a probably euphuistic) ' propitiousness.' 2 The Egyptians generally catch, train, and take them to thi banks of the Nile, where the 'Kurayeati' (ape-leader) is a populai character.XXXI,—The Three Days of Drying Flesh. 221 are docile, and are said to be fond of spirituous liquors, and to display an inordinate affection for [women. Al- Mas'udi tells about them a variety of anecdotes. Accord ing to him their principal use in Hind and Chin was to protect kings from poison, by eating suspected dishes. The Badawin have many tales concerning them. It is universally believed that they catch and kill kites, by exposing the rosy portion of their persons and concealing the rest; the bird pounces upon what appears to be raw meat, and presently finds himself viciously plucked alive. Throughout Arabia an old story is told of them. A mer chant was once plundered during his absence by a troop of these apes ; they tore open his bales, and, charmed with the scarlet hue of the Tarbushes, began applying those articles of dress to uses quite opposite to their normal purpose. The merchant was in despair, when his slave offered for a consideration to recover the goods. Placing himself in the front, like a fugleman to the ape-company, he went through a variety of manoeuvres with a Tarbush, and concluded with throwing it far away. The recruits carefully imitated him, and the drill concluded with his firing a shot; the plunderers decamped and the caps were recovered. Failing to see any apes, we retired to the tent ere the sun waxed hot, in anticipation of a terrible day. Nor were we far wrong. In addition to the heat, we had swarms of flies, and the blood-stained earth began to reek with noisome vapours. Nought moved in the air'except kites and vultures, speckling the deep blue sky: the denizens of earth seemed paralysed by the fire from above. I spent the time between breakfast and nightfall lying half- dressed upon a mat, moving round the tent-pole to escape the glare, and watching my numerous neighbours, male and female. The Indians were particularly kind, filling my pipe, offering cooled water, and performing similar little offices. I repaid them with a supply of provisions,'The Great Devil.' 222 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah, which, at the Muna market-prices, these unfortunates could ill afford. When the moon arose the boy Mohammed and I walked out into the town, per formed our second lapidation, 1 and visited the coffee-houses. The shops were closed early, but business was transacted in places of public resort till mid- —^ night. We entered the houses of numerous acquaintances, who accosted my companion, and were hospitably welcomed with pipes and coffee. The first question always was, ' Who is this pilgrim ? ' and more than once the reply, ' An Afghan,' elicited the language of my own country, which I could no longer speak. Of this phenomenon, however, nothing was thought: many Af ghans settled in India know not a word of Pushtu, and even above the Passes many of the t ownspeople are imperfectly i This ceremony, as the reader will have perceived, is performed by the Shafe'is on the loth, the nth, and the 12th of Zu'l Hijjah. The Hanafis conclude their stoning on the 13th. The times vary with each day, and differ considerably in religious efficacy. On the night of the 10th (our gth), for instance, lapidation, according to some authorities, cannot take place; others permit it, with a sufficient reason. Between the dawn and sunrise it is Makruh, or disapproved of. Between sunrise and the declination is the Sunnat-time, and therefore the best. From noon to sunset it is Mubah, or permissible the same is the case with the night, if a cause exist. On the ntl and 12th of Zu'l Hijjah lapidation is disapproved of from sunset tc sunrise. The Sunnat is from noon to sunset, and it is permissible at all other hours. The number of stones thrown by the Shafe'is, is 49, viz., 7 on the 10th day, 7 at each pillar (total 21) on the nth day, and the same on the 12th Zu'l Hijjah. The Hanafis also throw 21 stones on the 13th, which raises their number to 70. The first 7 bits of granite must be collected at Muzdalifah; the rest may be taker from the Muna valley; and all must be washed 7 times before being thrown. In throwing, the Hanafis attempt to approach the pillar, ii possible, standing within reach of it. Shafe'is may stand at a greatei distance, which should not, however, pass the limits of 5 cubits.XXXI.—The Three Days of Drying Flesh. 223 acquainted with it. The Meccans in consequence of their extensive intercourse with strangers and habits of travel- ling, are admirable conversational linguists. They speak Arabic remarkably well, and with a volubility surpassing the most lively of our continental nations. Persian, Turkish, and Hindustani are generally known : and the Mutawwifs, who devote themselves to various races of pilgrims, soon become masters of many languages. Returning homewards, we were called to a spot by the clapping of hands 1 and the loud sound of song. We found a crowd of Badawin surrounding a group engaged in their favourite occupation of dancing. The perform ance is wild in the extreme, resembling rather the hop ping of bears than the inspirations of Terpsichore. The bystanders joined in the song; an interminable recitative, as usual, in the minor key, and—Orientals are admirable timists—it sounded like one voice. The refrain appeared to be— 'LdYayhal LaYayhal' to which no one could assign a meaning. At other times they sang something intelligible. For instance:— 11 (J Ai S j:C .bJl .C That is to say,— ' On the Great Festival-day at Muna I saw my lord. I am a stranger amongst you, therefore pity me !' This couplet may have, like the puerilities of certain moder n and European poets, an abstruse and mystical 1 Here called Safk. It is mentioned by Herodotus, and known to almost every oriental people. The Badawin sometimes, though rarely, use a table or kettledrum. Yet, amongst the 'Pardah,' or musical modes of the East, we find the Hijazi ranking with the Isfahani and the Iraki. Southern Arabia has never been celebrated for producing musicians, like the banks of the Tigris to which we owe, besides castanets and cymbals, the guitar, the drum, and the lute, father of the modern harp. The name of this instrument is a corruption of the Arabic 'Al-'Ud' through liuto and luth, into lute.224 Pilgrimage to Al-MadinaJi and Meccah. meaning, to be discovered when the Arabs learn to writ erudite essays upon nursery rhymes. The style of salta tion, called Rufayah, rivalled the song. The dancer raised both arms above their heads, brandishing a dagger pistol, or some other small weapon. They followed eaci other by hops, on one or both feet, sometimes indulgingi the most demented leaps; whilst the bystanders clappe with their palms a more enlivening measure. This I m told is especially their war-dance. They have other form which my eyes were not fated to see. Amongst the Bad; win of Al-Hijaz, unlike the Somali and other Africa races, the sexes never mingle: the girls may dance tc gether, but it would be disgraceful to perform in the corr pany of men. After so much excitement we retired to rest, and slef soundly. On Friday, the i2th[Zu'l Hijjah, the camels appeared according to order, at early dawn, and they were loade with little delay. We were anxious to enter Meccah i time for the sermon, and I for one was eager to escap the now pestilential air of Muna. Literally, the land stank. Five or six thousaa animals had been slain and cut up in this Devil's Fund bowl. I leave the reader to imagine the rest. The ev. might be avoided by building abattoirs, or, more easilystii by digging long trenches, and by ordering all pilgrim under pain of mulct, to sacrifice in the same place. Ui happily, the spirit of Al-Islam is opposed to these pn cautions of common sense,—' Inshallah' and 'Kismat must take the place of prevention and of cure. And a Meccah, the head-quarters of the faith, a desolating attac of cholera is preferred to the impiety of ' flying in tb face of Providence,' and the folly of endeavouring t avert inevitable decrees. 1 ^ i Note to Third Edition .—Since this was written there ha^ been two deadly epidemics, which began, it is reported, at Mutt15 XXXI,—TJu Three Days of Drying Flesh. 225 o writ Mounting our camels, and led by Mas'ud, we entered f salta Muna by the eastern end, and from the litter threw the lancer remaining twenty-one stones.

Long-drawn faces and continual sighs evidenced nostalgia. At last the house became a scene of preparation. Blue china- ware and basketed bottles of Zemzem water appeared standing in solid columns, and pilgrims occupied them selves in hunting for mementoes of Meccah ; ground-plans; combs, balm, henna, tooth-sticks; aloes-wood, turquoises, coral, and mother-o'-pearl rosaries; shreds of Kiswah- cloth and fine Abas, or cloaks of camels'-wool. It was not safe to mount the stairs without shouting 'Tarik' (Out of the way!) at every step, on peril of meeting face to face some excited fair. 1 The lower floor was crowded with provision-vendors; and the staple article of conver sation seemed to be the chance of a steamer from Jeddah to Suez. Weary of the wrangling and chaffering of the hall below, I had persuaded my kind hostess, in spite of the surly skeleton her brother, partially to clear out a small store-room in the first floor, and to abandon it to me between the hours of ten and four. During the heat of the day clothing is unendurable at Meccah. The city is so 'compacted together' by hills, that even the Samum can scarcely sweep it; the heat reverberated by the bare rocks is intense, and the normal atmosphere of an Eastern town communicates a faint lassitude to the body and irritability to the mind. The houses being un usually strong and well-built, might by some art of therm- antidote be rendered cool enough in the hottest weather: the journey account for the smallness of the number. In theology it is ' Jaiz,' or admissible, to begin with the Prophet's place of burial. But those performing the ' Hajjat al-Islam ' are enjoined to commence at Meccah. i When respectable married men live together in the same house, a rare occurrence, except on journeys, this most ungallant practice of clearing the way is and must be kept up in the East.XXXII.—Life at Meccah, ami the Umrah. 229 they are now ovens. 1 It was my habit to retire immediately after the late breakfast to the little room upstairs, to sprinkle it with water, and to lie down on a mat. In the few precious moments of privacy notes were committed to paper, but one eye was ever fixed on the door. Some times a patient would interrupt me, but a doctor is far less popular in Al-Hijaz than in Egypt. The people, being more healthy, have less faith in physic: Shaykh Mas'ud and his son had never tasted in their lives aught more medicinal than green dates and camel's milk. Occasionally the black slave-girls came into the room, asking if the pilgrim wanted a pipe or a cup of coffee: they generally retired in a state of delight, attempting vainly to conceal with a corner of tattered veil a grand display of ivory consequent upon some small and innocent facetiousness. The most frequent of my visitors was Abdullah, the Kabirah's eldest son. This melancholy Jacques had joined our caravan at Al-Hamra, on the 1 I offer no lengthened description of the town of Meccah : Ali Bey and Burckhardt have already said all that requires saying. Although the origin of the Bayt Ullah be lost in the glooms of past time, the city is a comparatively modern place, built about a.d. 450, by Kusay and the Kuraysh, It contains about 30,000 to 45,000 in habitants, with lodging room for at least treble that number ; and the material of the houses is brick, granite, and sandstone from the neighbouring hills. The site is a winding valley, on a small plateau, half-way ' below the Ghauts.' Its utmost length is two miles and a half from the Mab'dah (North) to the Southern mount Jiyad ; and three- quarters of a mile would be the extreme breadth between Abu Kubays Eastward,—upon whose Western slope the most solid mass of the town cl usters,—and Jabal Hindi Westward of the city. In the centre of this hne stands the Ka'abah. I regret being unable to offer the reader a s etch of Meccah, or of the Great Temple. The stranger who would ' 0 this should visit the city out of the pilgrimage season, and hire a room looking into the quadrangle of the Harim. This addition to our knowledge is the more required, as our popular sketches (generally frorn D'Ohsson) are utterly incorrect. The Ka'abah is always a recognisable building ; but the 'View of Meccah ' known to Europe s not more like Meccah than like Cairo or Bombay.230 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Yambu' road, accompanied us to Al-Madinah, lived there, and journeyed to Meccah with the Syrian pilgrimage ; yet he had not once come to visit me or to see his brother, the boy Mohammed. When gently reproached for this omission, he declared it to be his way—that he never called upon strangers until sent for. He was a perfect Saudawi (melancholist) in mind, manners, and personal appearance, and this class of humanity in the East is almost as uncomfortable to, the household as the idiot of Europe. I was frequently obliged to share my meals with him, as his mother—though most filially and reverentially entreated—would not supply him with breakfast two hours after the proper time, or with a dinner served up forty minutes before the rest of the household. Often, too, I had to curb, by polite deprecation, the impetuosity of the fiery old Kabirah's tongue. Thus Abdullah and I became friends, after a fashion. He purchased several little articles required, and never failed to pass hours in my closet, giving me much information about the country; deploring the laxity of Meccan morals, and lamenting that in these evil days his countrymen had forfeited their name at Cairo and at Constantinople. His curiosity about the English in India was great, and I satisfied it by praising, as a Moslem would, their politike, their even- handed justice, and their good star. Then he would in quire into the truth of a fable extensively known on the shores of the Mediterranean and of the Red Sea. The English, it is said, sent a mission to Mohammed, inquiring into his doctrines, and begging that the heroic Khalid bin Walid 1 might be sent to proselytise them. Unfortunately, 1 It is curious that the Afghans should claim this Kuraysh noble as their compatriot. ' On one occasion, when Khalid bin Walid was saying something in his native tongue (the Pushtu or Afghani), Mohammed remarked that assuredly that language was the peculiar dialect of the damned. As Khalid appeared to suffer from the observation, and to betray certain symptoms of insubordination, the Prophet condescended to comfort him by graciously pronouncing theXXXII.—Life at Meccah, and the Umrah. 231 the envoys arrived too late—the Prophet's soul had winged its way to Paradise. An abstract of the Moslem scheme was, however, sent to the ' Ingreez,' who declined, as the Founder of the New Faith was no more, to abandon their own religion; but the refusal was accompanied with expressions of regard. For this reason many Moslems in Barbary and other countries hold the English to be of all 'People of the Books' the best inclined towards them. As regards the Prophet's tradi tion concerning the fall of his birthplace, and the thin- calved from the Habash (Abyssinians) shall destroy the Ka'abah,' I was informed that towards the end of time a host will pass from Africa in such multitudes that a stone shall be conveyed from hand to hand between Jeddah and Meccah. This latter condition might easily be accom plished by sixty thousand men, the distance being only forty-four miles, but the citizens consider it to express a countless horde. Some pious Moslems have hoped that in Abdullah bin Zubayr's re-erection of the Ka'abah the prophecy was fulfilled 1 : the popular belief, however, re mains that the fatal event is still in the womb of time. In a previous part of this volume I have alluded to similar evil presentiments which haunt the mind of Al-Islam; and the Christian, zealous for the propagation of his faith, may see in them an earnest of its still wider diffusion in future ages. 2 Late in the afternoon I used to rise, perform ablution, and repair to the Harim, or wander about the bazars till sunset. After this it was necessary to return home and prepare for supper—dinner it would be called in the West. words 'Ghashe lindd riovi,' i.e., bring me my bow and arrows.

I232 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Mac ah. The meal concluded, I used to sit for a time outside the street-door in great dignity, upon a broken-backed black- wood chair, traditionally said to have been been left in the house by one of the princes of Delhi, smoking a Shishah, and drinking sundry cups of strong green tea with a slice of lime, a fair substitute for milk. At this hour the seat was as in a theatre, but the words of the actors were of a nature somewhat too Fescennine for a respectable public. After nightfall we either returned to the Harim or retired to rest. Our common dormitory was the flat roof of the house; under each cot stood a water-gugglet; and all slept, as must be done in the torrid lands, on and not in bed. I sojourned at Meccah but a short time, and, as usual with travellers, did not see the best specimens of the population. The citizens appeared to me more civi lised and more vicious than those of Al-Madinah. They often leave ' Home, where small experience grows,' and— $ui multum pengrinatur, vavo sanctificatur —become a worldly-wise, God-forgetting, and Mammonish sorf of folk. Tuf w* asaa, w' aamil al-saba —' Circumambulate and run (i.e. between Safa and Marwah) and commit the Seven (deadly sins) is a satire popularly levelled against them. Hence, too, the proverb Al-havdm f il Haramayti 'Evil (dwelleth) in the two Holy Cities'; and no wonder, since plenary indulgence is so easily secured. 1 The pilgrim is forbidden, or rather dissuaded, from abid- ing at Meccah after the rites, and wisely. Great emotions must be followed by a re-action. And he who stands struck by the first aspect of Allah's house, after a few months, the marvel waxing stale, sweeps past with indif ference or something worse. 1 Good acts done at Meccah are rewarded a hundred-thousand fold in heaven, yet it is not auspicious to dwell there. Omar informs us that an evil deed receives the punishment of seventy.XXXII.—Life at Meccah, and the Umrah. 233 There is, however, little at Meccah to offend the eye. As among certain nations further West, a layer of ashes overspreads the fire: the mine is concealed by a green turf fair to look upon. It is only when wandering by starlight through the northern outskirts of the town that citizens may be seen with light complexions and delicate limbs, coarse turbands, and Egyptian woollen robes, speaking disguise and the purpose of disguise. No one within the memory of man has suffered the penalty of immorality. Spirituous liquors are no longer sold, as in Burckhardt's day, 1 in shops; and some Arnaut officers assured me that they found considerable difficulty in smuggling flasks of Araki from Jeddah. The Meccan is a darker man than the Madinite. The people explain this by the heat of the climate. I rather believe it to be caused by the number of female slaves that find their way into the market. Gallas, Sawa- hilis, a few Somalis, and Abyssinians are embarked at Suakin, Zayla, Tajurrah, and Berberah, carried in thou sands to Jeddah, and the Holy City has the pick of every batch. Thence the stream sets Northwards, a small cur rent towards Al-Madinah, and the main line to Egypt and Turkey. 2 Most Meccans have black concubines, and, as has been said, the appearance of the Sharif is almost that of a negro. I did not see one handsome man in the Holy City, although some of the women appeared to me beauti ful. The male profile is high and bony, the forehead recedes, and the head rises unpleasantly towards the region of firm ness. In most families male children, when forty days old, are taken to the Ka'abah, prayed over, and carried home, where the barber draws with a razor three parallel gashes 1 It must be remembered that my predecessor visited Meccah when the Egyptian army, commanded by Mohammed Ali, held the town. 2 In another place I have ventured a few observations concern- mgthe easy suppression of this traffic.234 Pilgviinagc to Al-Mcidiuah and Msec ah. down the fleshy portion of each cheek, from the exterioi ^ ou angles of the eyes almost to the corners of the mouth, ^ These Mashali, as they are called, 1 may be of modem bill date: the citizens declare that the custom was unknot r to their ancestors.

It is a common practice for the citizen to anticipate the pilgrimage season by falling into the hands of the usurer. If he be in luck, he catches and 'skins' one or more of the richest Hajis. On the other hand, should fortune fail him, he will feel for life the effect of interest running on at the rate of at least fifty per cent., the simple and the compound forms of which are equally familiar to the wily Sarraf. 1 The most unpleasant peculiarities of the Meccans 2 are their pride and coarseness of language. Looking upon themselves as the cream of earth's sons, they resent with extreme asperity the least slighting word concerning the Holy City and its denizens. They plume themselves upon their holy descent, their exclusion of Infidels, 8 their strict fastings, their learned men, and their purity of lan guage. 4 In fact, their pride shows itself at every moment; 1 Sayrafi, money-changer; Sarraf, banker; the Indian ' Shroff,' banker, money-changer, and usurer. 2 When speaking of the Meccans I allude only to the section of society which fell under my observation, and that more extensive division concerning which I obtained notices that could be depended upon. 3 The editor of Burckhardt's 'Travels in Arabia' supposes that his author's 'sect of light extinguishers' were probably Parsees from Surat or Bombay. The mistake is truly ludicrous, for no pious Parsee will extinguish a light. Moreover, infidels are not allowed by law to pass the frontiers of the Sanctuary. The sect alluded to is an obscure heresy in Central Asia; and concerning it the most im probable scandals have been propagated by the orthodox. 4 It is strange how travellers and linguists differ upon the subject of Arabic and its dialects. Niebuhr compares their relation to that of Proven9al, Spanish, and Italian, whereas Lane declares the dialects to resemble each other more than those of some different counties in England. Herbin (Grammar) draws a broad line between ancient and modern Arabic; but Hochst (Nachrichten von Marokos und Fez) asserts that the difference is not so great as is imagined. Per haps the soundest opinion is that proposed by Clodius, in his236 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. but it is not the pride which makes a man too proud to do in e 'dirty work.' My predecessor did not remark their scurrility: he seems, on the contrary, rather to commend them for respectability in this point. If he be correct, the mar present generation has degenerated. The Meccans ap- no 1 peared to me distinguished, even in this foul-mouthed an ^ East, by the superior licentiousness of their language. W1 ^ Abuse was bad enough in the streets, but in the house it became intolerable. The Turkish pilgrims remarked, but J ect they were too proud to notice it. The boy Mohammed and one of his tall cousins at last transgressed the limits ^ asa of my endurance. They had been reviling each other vilely one day at the house-door about dawn, when I ad- ministered the most open reprimand: 'In my country sem (Afghanistan) we hold this to be the hour of prayer, the a PP season of good thoughts, when men remember Allah; ^ no even the Kafir doth not begin the day with curses and ^ ur abuse.' The people around approved, and the offenders s P e&lt; could not refrain from saying, 'Thou hast spoken truth, O Effendi!' Then the bystanders began, as usual, to ^ ai1 'improve the occasion.' 'See,' they exclaimed, 'this ma ^ Sulaymani gentleman, he is not the Son of of a Holy City, t ^ a1 and yet he teacheth you—ye, the children of the Prophet! tr01 —repent and fear Allah!' They replied, 'Verily we do ar01 repent, and Allah is a Pardoner and the Merciful!'— were silent for an hour, and then abused each other more r ° r foully than before. Yet it is a good point in the Meccan character, that it is open to reason, it can confess itself ^ on Bet 'Arabic Grammar': 'dialectus Arabum vulgaris tantum differt }jg^ ab erudita, quantum Isocrates dictio ab hodterna lingua Grsecl' But it must be remembered that the Arabs divide their spoken and even written language into two orders, the 'Kalam Wati,' or vulgar ass&lt; tongue, sometimes employed in epistolary correspondence, and the clr C 'Nahwi,' or grammatical and classical language. Every man of the education uses the former, and can use the latter. And the Koran f r i e is no more a model of Arabic (as it is often assumed to be) than *' Paradise Lost' is of English.

The sir Meccans are, it is true, to be reproached with their hu open Mammon-worship, at times and at places the most ini sacred and venerable; but this has no other effect upon G( the pilgrims than to excite disgust and open reprehension. to Here, however, we see no such silly frauds as heavenly th fire drawn from a phosphor-match ; nor do two rival cle churches fight in the flesh with teeth and nails, requiring on the contemptuous interference of an infidel power to keep ca around order. Here we see no fair dames staring with their glasses, hraques at the Head of the Church ; or sup- at porting exhausted nature with the furtive sandwich; or Oi carrying pampered curs who, too often, will not be silent, or scrambling and squeezing to hear theatrical music, ar j reckless of the fate of the old lady who—on such occasions thi there is always one—has been ' thrown down and cruell) ex trampled upon by the crowd.' If the Meccan citizens ' are disposed to scoff at the wild Takruri, they do it not th so publicly or shamelessly as the Roman jeering with Se ribald jest at the fanaticism of strangers from the bogs of en Ireland.

Whether Ishmael or his sire ever visited Meccah to build the Ka'abah is, in my humble opinion, an open question. The Jewish Scripture informs us only that the patriarch dwelt at Beersheba and Gerar, in the south-west of Palestine, without any allusion to the annual visit which Moslems declare he paid to their Holy City. At the same time Arab tradition speaks clearly and consistently upon the subject, and generally omits those miraculous and superstitious adjuncts which cast shadows of sore doubt upon the philosophic mind. The amount of risk which a stranger must encounter at the pilgrimage rites is still considerable. A learned Orientalist and divine intimated his intention, in a work 1 The legend that Abraham was the ' Son of Fire ' might have arisen from his birthplace, Ur of the Chaldees. This Ur (whence the Latin tiro) becomes in Persian Hir; in Arabic Irr or Arr. It explains the origin of 'Orotalt' better than by means of 'Allahu Ta'ala.' This word, variously spelt Ourotalt, Orotalt, and Orotal (the latter would be the masculine form in Arabic), is Urrat-ilat, or the goddess of fire, most probably the Sun (Al-Shams) which the Semites make a feminine. Forbiggen translates it Sonnen-gott, an error of gender, as the final consonant proves. The other deity of pagan Arabia, Alilat, is clearly Ai-Lat. May not the Phoenicians have supplied the word 'Irr,' which still survives in Erin and in Ireland? even so they gave to the world the name of Britain, Brettainke, Barrat et Tanuki (eLiJl tjJ), the land of tin. And I should more readily believe that Eeran is the land of fire, than accept its derivation from Eer (vir) a man.240 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah ar.d Meccah. published but a few years ago, of visiting Meccah without disguise. He was assured that the Turkish governor would now offer no obstacle to a European traveller. I would strongly dissuade a friend from making the attempt. It is true that the Frank is no longer, as in Captain Head's day, 1 insulted when he ventures out of the Meccan Gate of Jeddah; and that our Vice-Consuls and travellers are allowed, on condition that their glance do not pollute the shrine, to visit Taif and the regions lying Eastward of the Holy City. Neither the Pasha nor the Sharif would, in these days, dare to enforce, in the case of an English man, the old law, a choice thrice offered between circum cision and death. But the first Badawi who caught sight of the Frank's hat would not deem himself a man if he did not drive a bullet through the wearer's head. At the pilgrimage season disguise is easy on account of the vast and varied multitudes which visit Meccah exposing the traveller only to ' stand the buffet with knaves who smell of sweat.' But woe to the unfortu nate who happens to be recognised in public as an Infidel—unless at least he could throw himself at once upon the protection of the government. 2 Amidst, however, a crowd of pilgrims, whose fanaticism is worked up to the highest pitch, detection would probably ensure his dismissal at once al ntmero de' piu. Those who find danger the salt of pleasure may visit Meccah ; but if asked whether the results justify the risk, I should reply in the negative. And the Vice-Consul at Jeddah would only do his duty in peremptorily forbidding European travellers to attempt Meccah without disguise, until the day comes when such steps can be taken in the certainty of not causing a mishap; 1 Captain C. F. Head, author of ' Eastern and Egyptian Scenery,' was, as late as a.d. 1829, pelted by the Badawin, because he passed the Eastern gate of Jeddah in a Prankish dress. 2 The best way would be to rush, if possible, into a house; and the owner would then, for his own interest, as well as honour, defend a atranger till assistance could be procured.XXXII.—Life at Meccah, and the Umrah. 241 an accident would not redound to our reputation, as we could not in justice revenge it. 1 On the 14th Zu'l Hijjah we started to perform the rite of Umrah, or Little Pilgrimage. After performing ablution, and resuming the Ihram with the usual cere monies, I set out, accompanied by the boy Mohammed and his brother Abdullah. Mounting asses which resembled mules in size and speed, 3 we rode to the Harim, and prayed there. Again remounting, we issued through the Bab al-Safa towards the open country north-east of the city. The way was crowded with pilgrims, on foot as well as mounted, and their loud Lahhayk distinguished those en S a £&gt; e&lt; i in the Umrah rite from the many whose business was with the camp of the Damascus Caravan. At about half a mile from the city we passed on the left a huge heap of stones, where my companions stood and cursed. This grim-looking cairn is popularly believed to note the place of the well where Abu Lahab laid an ambuscade for the Prophet. This wicked uncle stationed there a slave, with orders to throw headlong into the pit the first person who 1 Future pilgrims must also remember that the season is gradually receding towards the heart of the hot weather. For the next fifteen years, therefore, an additional risk will attend the traveller. 2 Pliny is certainly right about this useful quadruped and its congeners, the zebra and the wild ass, in describing it as 'animal frigoris maxime impatiens.' It degenerates in cold regions, unless, as in Afghanistan and Barbary, there be a long, hot, and dry summer! Aden, Cutch, and Baghdad have fine breeds, whereas those of India and South-Eastern Africa are poor and weak. The best and the ighest-priced come from the Maghrib, and second to them ranks the Egyptian race. At Meccah careful feeding and kind usage transform the dull slave into an active and symmetrical friend of man: he knows his owner's kind voice, and if one of the two fast, it is generally the biped. The asses of the Holy City are tall and p ump, with sleek coats, generally ash or grey-coloured, the eyes of eer, heads gracefully carried, an ambling gait, and extremely sure- ootea. They are equal to great fatigue, and the stallions have been Known miheir ferocity, to kill the groom. The price varies from 25 10 150 dollars. J VOL.

We added our quota of stones, 2 and pro ceeding, saw the Jeddah road spanning the plain like a white ribbon. In front of us the highway was now lined with coffee-tents, before which effeminate dancing-boys performed to admiring Syrians ; a small whitewashed ' Bungalow,' the palace of the Emir al-Hajj, lay on the left, and all around it clustered the motley encampment of his pilgrims. After cantering about three miles from the city, we reached the Alamayn, or two pillars that limit the Sanctuary ; and a little beyond it is the small settle ment popularly called Al-Umrah. 8 Dismounting here, we 1 Such is the popular version of the tale, which differs in some points from that recorded in books. Others declare that here, in days gone by, stood the house of another notorious malignant, Abu Jahl. Some, again, suppose that in this place a tyrannical governor of Meccah was summarily ' lynched ' by the indignant populace. The first two traditions, however, are the favourites, the vulgar- citizens, as well as pilgrims—loving to connect such places with the events of their early sacred history. Even in the twelfth century we read that pilgrims used to cast stones at two cairns, covering the remains of Abu Lahab, and the beautiful termagant, his wife. 2 Certain credulous authors have contrasted these heaps with the clear ground at Muna, for the purpose of a minor miracle. According to them this cairn steadily grows, as we may believe it would; and that, were it not for the guardian angels, the millions of little stones annually thrown at the devils would soon form a mass of equal magnitude. This custom of lapidation, in token of hate, is an ancient practice, still common in the East. Yet, in some parts of Arabia, stones are thrown at tombs as a compliment to the tenant. And in the Somali country, the places where it is said holy men sat, receive the same doubtful homage. 3 It is called in books Al-Tanim (bestowing plenty); a word which readers must not confound with the district of the same nameXXXII.—Life at Meccah, and the Umrah, 243 sat down on rugs outside a cofifee-tent to enjoy the beauty of the moonlit night, and an hour of Kayf, in the sweet air of the Desert. Presently the coffee-tent keeper, after receiving pay ment, brought us water for ablution. This preamble over, we entered the principal chapel ; an unpretending building, badly lighted, spread with dirty rugs, full of pil grims, and offensively close. Here we prayed the Isha, or night devotions, and then a two-bow prayer in honour of the Ihram, 1 after which we distributed gratuities to the guardians, and alms to the importunate beggars. And now I perceived the object of Abdullah's companionship. The melancholy man assured me that he had ridden out for love of me, and in order to perform as Wakil (substi tute) a vicarious pilgrimage for my parents. Vainly I assured him that they had been strict in the exercises of their faith. He would take no denial, and I perceived that love of me meant love of my dollars. With a surly assent, he was at last permitted to act for the 'pious pilgrim Yusuf (Joseph) bin Ahmad and Fatimah bint Yunus,'—my progenitors. It was impossible to pre vent smiling at contrasts, as Abdullah, gravely raising his hands, and directing his face to the Ka'abah, intoned, ' I do vow this Ihram of Umrah in the name of Yusuf Son of Ahmad, and Fatimah Daughter of Yunus ; then render it attainable unto them, and accept it of them 1 Bismillah ! Allaho Akbar !' in the province Khaulan (made by Niebuhr the 'Thurana,' ' Thomna,' or ' Tamna,' capital of the Catabanites). Other authors apply Al-Tanim to the spot where Abu Lahab is supposed to lie. There are two places called Al-Umrah near Meccah. The Kabir, or greater, is, I am told, in the Wady Fatimah, and the Prophet ordered Ayishah and her sister to begin the ceremonies at that place. It is now visited by picnic parties and those who would pray at the tomb of Maimunah, one of the Prophet's wives. Modern pilgrims com mence always, I am told, at the Umrah Saghir (the Lesser), which is about half-way nearer the city. 1 Some assume the Ihram garb at this place.244 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Remounting, we galloped towards Meccah, shouting Lahbayk, and halting at every half-mile to smoke and drink coffee. In a short time we entered the city, and repairing to the Harim by the Safa Gate, performed the Tawaf, or circumambulation of Umrah. After this dull round and necessary repose we left the temple by the same exit, and mounting once more, turned towards Al-Safa, which stands about a hundred yards South-East of the Mosque, and as little deserves its name of ' Mountain ' as do those that undulate the face of modern Rome. The Safa end is closed by a mean-looking building, composed of three round arches, with a dwarf flight of stairs leading up to them out of a narrow road. Without dismounting, we wheeled our donkeys 1 round, 'left shoulders forward,' no easy task in the crowd, and, vainly striving to sight the Ka'abah through the Bab al-Safa, performed the Niyat, or vow of the rite Al-Sai, or the running. 2 After Tahlil, Tak- bir, and Talbiyat, we raised our hands in the supplicatory position, and twice repeated, 3 ' There is no god but Allah, Alone, without Partner ; His is the Kingdom, unto Him be Praise ; He giveth Life and Death, He is alive and perisheth not ; in His Hand is Good, and He over all Things is Omnipotent.' Then, with the donkey-boys leading our animals and a stout fellow preceding us with lantern and a quarter-staff to keep off the running Badawin, camel-men, and riders of asses, we descended Safa, and walked slowly down the street Al-Massa, towards Marwah. 4 1 We had still the pretext of my injured foot. When the Sai rite is performed, as it should be, by a pedestrian, he mounts the steps to about the height of a man, and then turns towards the temple. 2 I will not trouble the reader with this Niyat, which is the same as that used in the Tawaf rite. 3 Almost every Mutawwif, it must be remembered, has his own set of prayers. 4 'Safa' means a large, hard rock; 'Marwah,' hard, white flints, full of fire.XXXII.—Life at Meccah, and the Umyah. 245 During our descent we recited aloud, ' O Allah, cause me to act according to the Sunnat of Thy Prophet, and to die in His faith, and defend me from errors and disobedience by Thy Mercy, O most Merciful of the Merciful !' Arrived at what is called the Batn al-Wady (Belly of the Vale), a place now denoted by the Milayn al-Akhzarayn (the two green pillars 1 ), one fixed in the Eastern course of the Harim, the other in a house on the right side, 2 we began the running by urging on our beasts. Here the prayer was, ' O Lord, pardon and pity, and pass over what Thou knowest, for Thou art the most dear and the most generous ! Save us from Hell-fire safely, and cause us safely to enter Paradise ! O Lord, give us Happiness here and Happiness hereafter, and spare us the Torture of the Flames ! ' At the end of this supplication we had passed the Batn, or lowest ground, whose farthest limits were marked by two other pillars. 8 Again we began to ascend, repeating, as we went, ' Verily, Safa and Marwah are two of the Monuments of Allah. Whoso, therefore, pilgrimeth to the Temple of Meccah, or performeth Umrah, it shall be no Crime in him (to run between them both). And as for him who voluntarily doeth a good Deed, verily Allah is Grateful and Omniscient 4 !' At length we reached Marwah, a little rise like Safa in the lower slope of Abu Kubays. The houses cluster in amphitheatre shape above it, and from the Masa'a, or street below, a short flight of steps to a platform, bounded on three sides like a tennis-court, by tall walls without arches. The 1 In former times a devastating torrent used to sweep this place after rains. The Fiumara bed has now disappeared, and the pillars are used as landmarks. Galland observes that these columns are planted upon the place which supported Eve's knees, when, after 300 years' separation, she was found by Adam. 2 This house is called in books Rubat al-Abbas. 3 Here once stood ' As'af ' and 'Naylah,' two idols, some say a man and a woman metamorphosed for stupration in the Temple. 4 Koran, chap. ii.246 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. street, seen from above, has a bowstring curve : it is between eight and nine hundred feet long, 1 with high houses on both sides, and small lanes branching off from it. At the foot of the platform we brought 'right shoulders forward,' so as to face the Ka'abah, and raising hands to ears, thrice exclaimed, ' Allaho Akbar.' This concluded the first course, and, of these, seven compose the ceremony Al-Sai, or the running. - There was a startling contrast with the origin of this ceremony,— 'When the poor outcast on the cheerless wild, Arabia's parent, clasped her fainting child,'— as the Turkish infantry marched, in European dress, with sloped arms, down the Masa'a to relieve guard. By the side of the half-naked, running Badawin, they look as if Epochs, disconnected by long centuries, had met. A laxity, too, there was in the frequent appearance of dogs upon this holy and most memorial ground, which said little in favour of the religious strictness of the administration. 3 Our Sai ended at Mount Marwah. There we dis mounted, and sat outside a barber's shop, on the right- hand of the street. He operated upon our heads, causing us to repeat, 'O Allah, this my Forelock is in Thy Hand, then grant me for every Hair a light on the Resurrection- day, O Most Merciful of the Merciful!' This, and the paying for it, constituted the fourth portion of the Umrah, or Little Pilgrimage. Throwing the skirts of our garments over our heads, to show that our ' Ihram' was now exchanged for the normal state, ' Ihlal,' we cantered to the Harim, prayed there a two-bow prayer, and returned home not a little fatigued. 1 Ibn Jubayr gives 893 steps: other authorities make the distance 780 short cubits, the size of an average man's forearm. 2 The ceremony of running between Safa and Marwah is supposed to represent Hagar seeking water for her son. Usually pilgrims per form this rite on the morning of visiting the Ka'abah.CHAPTER XXXIII. places of pious visitation at meccah. T he traveller has little work at the Holy City. With exceptions of Jabal Nur and Jabal Saur, 1 all the places of pious visitation lie inside or close outside the city. It is well worth the while to ascend Abu Kubays; not so much to inspect the Makan al-Hajar and the Shakk al-Kamar, 3 as to obtain an excellent bird's-eye view of the Harim and the parts adjacent. 8 The boy Mohammed had applied himself sedulously to commerce after his return home; and had actually been seen by Shaykh Nur sitting in a shop and selling small curiosities. With my plenary consent I was made 1 Jabal Nur, or Hira, has been mentioned before. Jabal Saur rises at some distance to the South of Meccah, and contains the celebrated cave in which Mohammed and Abu Bakr took refuge during the flight. 2 The tradition of these places is related by every historian. The former is the repository of the Black Stone during the Deluge. The latter, ' splitting of the moon,' is the spot where the Prophet stood when, to convert the idolatrous Kuraysh, he caused half the orb of night to rise from behind Abu Kubays, and the other from Jabal Kayka'an, on the Western horizon. This silly legend appears unknown to Mohammed's day. 3 The pilgrimage season, strictly speaking, concluded this year on the 17th September (13th Zu'l Hijjah); at which time travellers began to move towards Jeddah. Those who purposed visiting Al- Madinah would start about three weeks afterwards, and many who bad leisure intended witnessing the Muharram ceremonies at Meccah.248 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. over to Abdullah, his brother. On the morning of the 15th Zu'l Hijjah (19th Sept.) he hired two asses, and accompanied me as guide to the holy places. Mounting our animals, we followed the road before described to the Jannat al-Ma'ala, the sacred cemetery of Meccah. A rough wall, with a poor gateway, encloses a patch of barren and grim-looking ground, at the foot of the chain which bounds the city's western suburb, and be low Al-Akabah, the gap through which Khalid bin Walid entered Meccah with the triumphant Prophet. 1 Inside are a few ignoble, whitewashed domes: all are of modern construction, for here, as at Al-Bakia, further north, the Wahhabis indulged their levelling propensities. 2 The rest of the ground shows some small enclosures belonging to particular houses,—equivalent to our family vaults,— and the ruins of humble tombs, lying in confusion, whilst a few parched aloes spring from between the bricks and stones. 8 1 This is the local tradition; it does not agree with authentic history. Muir (Life of Mahomet, vol. iv. p. 126) reminds me that Khalid and his Badawin attacked the citizens of Meccah without the Prophet's leave. But after the attack he may have followed in his leader's train. 2 The reason of their Vandalism has been noticed in a previous volume. 3 The Aloe here, as in Egypt, is hung, like the dried crocodile, over houses as a talisman against evil spirits. Burckhardt assigns, as a motive for it being planted in graveyards, that its name Saber denotes the patience with which the believer awaits the Last Day. And Lane remarks, 'The Aloe thus hung (over the door), without earth and water, will live for several years, and even blossom: hence it is called Saber, which signifies patience.' In India it is hung up to prevent Mosquitoes entering a room. I believe the superstition to be a fragment of African fetichism. The Gallas, to the present day, plant Aloes on graves, and suppose that when the plant sprouts the deceased has been admitted into the gardens of 'Wak'—the Creator. Ideas breed vocables; but seldom, except among rhyme sters, does a vocable give birth to a popular idea: and in Arabic 'Sibr,' as well as 'Sabr,' is the name of the Aloe.XXXIII.—Places of Pious Visitation at Meccah. 249 The cemetery is celebrated in local history: here the body of Abdullah bin Zubayr was exposed by order of Hajjaj bin Yusuf; and the number of saints buried in it has been so numerous, that even in the twelfth century many had fallen into oblivion. It is visited by the citizens on Fridays, and by women on Thursdays, to pre vent that meeting of sexes which in the East is so detri mental to public decorum. I shall be sparing in my description of the Ma'ala ceremonies, as the prayers, prostrations, and supplications are almost identical with those performed at Al-Bakia. After a long supplication, pronounced standing at the doorway, we entered, and sauntered about the burial- ground. On the left of the road stood an enclosure, which, according to Abdullah, belonged to his family. The door and stone slabs, being valuable to the poor, had been removed, and the graves of his forefathers appeared to have been invaded by the jackal. He sighed, recited a Fatihah with tears in his eyes, and hurried me away from the spot. The first dome which we visited covered the remains of Abd al-Rahman, the son of Abu Bakr, one of the Worthies of Al-Islam, equally respected by Sunni and by Shi'ah. The tomb was a simple catafalque, spread with the usual cloth. After performing our devotions at this grave, and distributing a few piastres to guardians and beggars, we crossed the main path, and found ourselves at the door of the cupola, beneath which sleeps the venerable Khadijah, Mohammed's first wife. The tomb was covered with a green cloth, and the walls of the little building were decorated with written specimens of re- 'gious poetry. A little beyond it, we were shown into another dome, the resting-place of Sitt Aminah, the Pro- P et s mother. 1 B urckhardt chronicles its ill-usage by 1 Burckhardt mentions the 'Tomb of Umna, the mother of 0 amme d,' in the Ma'ala at Meccah; and all the ciceroni agree250 Pilgrimage to Al -Madinah and Meccah. the fanatic Wahhabis : it has now been rebuilt in that frugal style that characterizes the architecture of Al-Hijaz. An exceedingly garrulous old woman came to the door, invited us in, and superintended our devotions; at the end of which she sprinkled rosewater upon my face. When asked for a cool draught, she handed me a metal saucer, whose contents smelt strongly of mastic, earnestly directing me to drink it in a sitting posture. This tomb she informed us is the property of a single woman, who visits it every evening, receives the contributions of the Faithful, prays, sweeps the pavement, and dusts the fur niture. We left five piastres for this respectable maiden, and gratified the officious crone with another shilling. She repaid us by signalling to some score of beggars that a rich pilgrim had entered the Ma'ala, and their impor tunities fairly drove me out of the hallowed walls. Leaving the Jannat al-Ma'ala, we returned towards the town, and halted on the left side of the road, at a mean building called the Masjid al-Jinn (of the Genii). Here was revealed the seventy-second chapter of the Koran, called after the name of the mysterious fire-drakes who paid fealty to the Prophet. Descending a flight of steps,—for this Mosque, like all ancient localities at Meccah, is as much below as above ground,—we entered a small apartment containing water-pots for drinking and all the appurtenances of ablution. In it is shown the Mauza al-Khatt (place of the writing), where Mohammed wrote a letter to Abu Mas'ud after the homage of the Jinnis. A second and interior flight of stone steps led to another diminutive oratory, where the Prophet used to pray and receive the archangel Gabriel. Having per formed a pair of bows, which caused the perspiration about the locality. Yet historians place it at Abwa, where she gav; up the ghost, after visiting Al-Madinah to introduce her son to bf relations. And the learned believe that the Prophet refused to pra; over or to intercede for his mother, she having died before Al-Islar was revealed.XXXIII.—Places of Pious Visitation at Meccah. 251 to burst forth as if in a Russian bath, I paid a few piastres, and issued from the building with much satis faction. We had some difficulty in urging our donkeys through the crowded street, called the Zukak al-Hajar. Presently we arrived at the Bayt al-Nabi, the Prophet's old house, in which he lived with the Sitt Khadijah. Here, says Burckhardt, the Lady Fatimah first saw the light 1 ; and here, according to Ibn Jubayr, Hasan and Hosayn were born. Dismounting at the entrance, we descended a deep flight of steps, and found ourselves in a spacious hall, vaulted, and of better appearance than most of the sacred edifices at Meccah. In the centre, and well railed round, stood a closet of rich green and gold stuffs, in shape not unlike an umbrella-tent. A surly porter guarded the closed door, which some respect able people vainly attempted to open by honeyed words : a whisper from Abdullah solved the difficulty. I was directed to lie at full length upon my stomach, and to kiss a black-looking stone—said to be the lower half of the Lady Fatimah's quern 2 —fixed at the bottom of a basin of the same material. Thence we repaired to a corner, and recited a two-bow at the place where the Prophet used to pray the Sunnat and the Nafilah, or supererogatory devotions. 8 Again remounting, we proceeded at a leisurely pace homewards, and on the way passed through the principal 1 Burckhardt calls it ' Maulid Sittna Fatimah ' : but the name *'Kuhhat el Wahy,' applied by my predecessor to this locality, is generally made synonymous with Al-Mukhtaba, the ' hiding-place' where the Prophet and his followers used in dangerous times to meet for prayer. 2 So loose is local tradition, that some have confounded this quern with the Natak al-Nabi, the stone which gave God-speed to the Prophet. 3 He would of course pray the Farz, or obligatory devotions, at the shrine.252 Pilgrimage to A l-Madinah and Meccah, slave-market.

The owner is highly popular among the Badawin, and feared by the citizens on account of his fierce looks, courage, aud treachery. They described him to me as vir bonus, bene stvangulando peritus; but Mr. Cole, who knew him personally, gave him a high character for generosity and freedom from fanaticism. He seems to have some idea of the state which should ' hedge in ' a ruler. His palaces at Meccah, and that now turned into a Wakalah at Jeddah, are the only places in the country that can be called princely. He is now a state prisoner at Constantinople, and the Badawin pray in vain for his return. 1 The other places of pious visitation at Meccah are briefly these:— 1. Natak al-Nabi, a small oratory in the Zukak al- Hajar. It derives its name from the following circum- 1. The Prince was first invested with the Sharifat by Mohammed Ali of Egypt in a.d. 1827, when Yahya fled, after stabbing his nephew in the Ka'abah, to the Benu Harb Badawin. He was supported by Ahmad Pasha of Meccah, with a large army; but after the battle of Tarabah, in which Ibrahim Pasha was worsted by the Badawin, Mohammed Bin Aun, accused of acting as Sylla, was sent in honour able bondage to Cairo. He again returned to Meccah, where the rapacity of his eldest son, Abdullah, who would rob pilgrims, caused fresh misfortunes. In a.d. 1851, when Abd al-Muttalib was appointed Sharif, the Pasha was ordered to send Bin Aun to Stambul—no easy task. The Turk succeeded by a manoeuvre. Mohammed's two sons, happening to be at Jeddah, were invited to inspect a man-of-war, and were there made prisoners. Upon this the father yielded himself up; although, it is said, the flashing of the Badawi's sabre during his em barkation made the Turks rejoice that they had won the day by state-craft. The wild men of Al-Hijaz still sing songs in honour of this Sharif. 1 J OTETO Second E dition.— Early in 1856, when the Sharif Abd al-Mattahb was deposed, Mohammed bin Aun was sent from Con- stantmople to quiet the insurrection caused by the new slave laws in Al-Hijaz. In a short space of time he completely succeeded.2^ Pilgrimage to Al-Madmcih and Meccah, stance. As the Prophet was knocking at the door of Abu Bakr's shop, a stone gave him God-speed, and told him that the master was not at home. The wonderful mineral is of a reddish-black colour, about a foot in dimen sion, and fixed in the wall somewhat higher than a man's head. There are servants attached to it, and the street sides are spread, as usual, with the napkins of importun- ate beggars. 2. Maulid al-Nabi, or the Prophet's birthplace. 1 It is a little chapel in the Suk al-Layl, not far from Mohammec bin Aun's palace. It is below the present level of thi ground, and in the centre is a kind of tent, concealing, i is said, a hole in the floor upon which Aminah sat to b( delivered. 3. In the quarter 'Sha'ab Ali,' near the Maulid al Nabi, is the birthplace of Ali, another oratory below thf ground. Here, as in the former place, a Maulid and &lt; Ziyarah are held on the anniversary of the Lion's birth. 4. Near Khadijah's house and the Natak al-Nabi a place called Al-Muttaka, from a stone against which the Prophet leaned when worn out with fatigue. It is mud visited by devotees ; and some declare that on one occa sion, when the Father of Lies appeared to the Prophet it the form of an elderly man, and tempted him to sin bj asserting that the Mosque-prayers were over, this stone, disclosing the fraud, caused the Fiend to flee. 5. Maulid Hamzah, a little building at the old Ba: Umrah, near the Shabayki cemetery. Here was tb Bazan, or channel down which the Ayn Hunayn ran int the Birkat Majid.

Before leaving Meccah I was urgently invited to dine by old Ali bin Ya Sin, the Zemzemi; a proof that he entertained inordinate expectations, excited, it appeared, by the boy Mohammed, for the simple purpose of exalt ing his own dignity. One day we were hurriedly sum moned about three p.m . to the senior's house, a large building in the Zukak al-Hajar. We found it full of pil grims, amongst whom we had no trouble to recognise our fellow-travellers, the quarrelsome old Arnaut and his im pudent slave-boy. Ali met us upon the staircase, and conducted us into an upper room, where we sat upon diwans, and with pipes and coffee prepared for dinner. Presently the semicircle arose to receive a eunuch, who lodged somewhere in the house. He was a person of im portance, being the guardian of some dames of high de gree at Cairo and Constantinople: the highest place and enumerated. The ciceroni and books mention twelve other visita tions, several of which are known only by name. 1. Al-Mukhtaba, the ' hiding-place ' alluded to in the preceding pages. Its locality is the subject of debate. 2. Dar al-Khayzaran, where the Prophet prayed secretly till the con version of Omar enabled him to dispense with concealment. 3- Maulid Omar, or Omar's birthplace, mentioned in books as being visited by devotees in the 14th Rabia al-Awwal of every year. 4- Abu Bakr's house near the Natak al -Nabi. It is supposed to have been destroyed in the twelfth century. 5' Maulid Ja'afar al-Tayyar, near the Shabayki cemetery. 6. Al-Mada'a, an oratory, also called Naf al-Arz, because creation here began. ?• Dar al-Hijrah, where Mohammed and Abu Bakr mounted for the flight. 8. Masjid al-Rayah, where the Prophet planted his flag when Meccah surrendered. 9- Masjid al-Shajarah, a spot at which Mohammed caused a tree to advance and to retire. 10.

TO JEDDAH. A general plunge into worldly pursuits and pleasures announced the end of the pilgrimage ceremonies. All the devotees were now ' whitewashed '—the book of their sins was a tabula rasa : too many of them lost no time in making a new departure 'down south,' and in opening a fresh account. The faith must not bear the blame of the irregularities. They may be equally observed in the Cal- vinist, after a Sunday of prayer, sinning through Monday with a zest, and the Romanist falling back with new fer vour upon the causes of his confession and penance, as in the Moslem who washes his soul clean by running and circumambulation ; and, in fairness, it must be observed that, as amongst Christians, so in the Moslem persuasion, there are many notable exceptions to this rule of extremes. Several of my friends and acquaintances date their reform ation from their first sight of the Ka'abah. The Moslem's ' Holy Week' over, nothing detained me at Meccah. For reasons before stated, I resolved upon returning to Cairo, resting there for awhile, and starting a second time for the interior, via Muwaylah. 1 The Meccans are as fond of little presents as are nuns : the Kabirah took an affectionate leave of me, begged me to be careful of her boy, who was to accom- i This second plan was defeated by bad health, which detained we in Egypt till a return to India became imperative.26o Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. pany me to Jeddah, and laid friendly but firm hands upon a brass pestle and mortar, upon which she had long cast! the eye of concupiscence. Having hired two camels for thirty-five piastres, and paid half the sum in advance, I sent on my heavy boxes with Shaykh, now Haji Nur, to Jeddah. 1 Omar Effendi was to wait at Meccah till his father had started, in com mand of the Dromedary Caravan, when he would privily take ass, join me at the port, and return to his beloved Cairo. I bade a long farewell to all my friends, em braced the Turkish pilgrims, and mounting our donkeys, the boy Mohammed and I left the house. Abdullah the Melancholy followed us on foot through the city, and took leave of me, though without embracing, at the Shabayki quarter. Issuing into the open plain, I felt a thrill of pleasure —such joy as only the captive delivered from his dungeon can experience. The sunbeams warmed me into renewed life and vigour, the air of the Desert was a perfume, and the homely face of Nature was as the smile of a dear old friend. I contemplated the Syrian Caravan, lying on the right of our road, without any of the sadness usually sug gested by a parting look. It is not my intention minutely to describe the line down which we travelled that night: the pages of Burck- hardt give full information about the country. Leaving Meccah, we fell into the direct road running south of Wady Fatimah, and traversed for about an hour a flat surrounded by hills. Then we entered a valley by a flight of rough stone steps, dangerously slippery and zig zag, intended to facilitate the descent for camels and for laden beasts.

The others mounted, and left us quietly to sleep. I have been diffuse in relating this little adventure, which is characteristic, showing what bravado can do inj Arabia. It also suggests a lesson, which every traveller in these regions should take well to heart. The people are always ready to terrify him with frightful stories, which are the merest phantoms of cowardice. The reason why the Egyptian displayed so much philanthropy was that, had one of the party been lost, the survivors might have fallen into trouble. But in this place, we were, I believe,—despite the declarations of our com panions that it was infested with Turpins and Fra Diavolos,—as safe as in Meccah. Every night, during the pilgrimage season, a troop of about fifty horsemen patrol the roads ; we were all armed to the teeth, and our party looked too formidable to be ' cruelly beaten by a single footpad.' Our nap concluded, we remounted, and resumed the weary way down a sandy valley, in which the poor donkeys sank fetlock-deep. At dawn we found our companions halted, and praying at the Kahwat Turki, another little coffee-house. Here an exchange of what is popularly called 'chaff' took place. 'Well,' cried the Egyptian, 'what have ye gained by halting? We have been quiet here, praying and smoking for the last hour!' ' Go, eat thy buried beans, 1 ' we replied. 'What does an Egyptian boor know of manliness!' The surly donkey-boy was worked up into a paroxysm of passion by such small jokes as telling him to convey our salams to the Governor of Jeddah, and by calling the asses after the name of his tribe. He replied by ' foul, unmannered, scurril taunts,' which only drew forth fresh derision, and the coffee-house keeper laughed consumedly, 1 The favourite Egyptian food by the Arabs. kitchen ' ; held to be contemptibleXXXIV.—To Jeddah. 265 having probably seldom entertained such 'funny gentle men.' Shortly after leaving the Kahwat Turki we found the last spur of the highlands that sink into the Jeddah Plain. This view would for some time be my last of ' Infamous hills, and sandy, perilous wilds and I contemplated it with the pleasure of one escaping from it. Before us lay the usual iron flat of these regions, whitish with salt, and tawny with stones and gravel; but relieved and beautified by the distant white walls, whose canopy was the lovely blue sea. Not a tree, not a patch of verdure was in sight; nothing distracted our attention from the sheet of turquoises in the distance. Merrily the little donkeys hobbled on, in spite of their fatigue. Soon we distinguished the features of the town, the minarets, the fortifications—so celebrated since their honeycombed guns beat off in 1817 the thousands of Abdullah bin Sa'ud, the Wahhabi, 1 and a small dome outside the walls. The sun began to glow fiercely, and we were not sorry when, at about eight a.m., after passing through the mass of hovels and coffee-houses, cemeteries and sand hills, which forms the eastern approach to Jeddah, we entered the fortified Bab Makkah. Allowing eleven hours for our actual march,—we halted about three,— those wonderful donkeys had accomplished between forty- 1 In 1817 Abdullah bin Sa'ud attacked Jeddah with 50,000 men, determining to overthrow its ' Kafir-works' ; namely, its walls and towers. The assault is described as ludicrous. All the inhabitants aided to garrison: they waited till the wild men flocked about the place, crying, 'Come, and let us look at the labours of the infidel,' they then let fly, and raked them with matchlock balls and old nails acting grape. The Wahhabi host at last departed, unable to take a place which a single battery of our smallest siege-guns would breach in an hour.

And they passed the archway of Jeddah cantering eve almost as nimbly as when they left Meccah. asS( Shaykh Nur had been ordered to take rooms for me p ro in a vast pile of madrepore—unfossilized coral, a recent formation,—once the palace of Mohammed bin Ann, and t h a now converted into a Wakalah. Instead of so doing, Indian-like, he had made a gipsy encampment in the square opening upon the harbour. After administering our the requisite correction, I found a room that would suit T e( j ( me. In less than an hour it was swept, sprinkled with j ow water, spread with mats, and made as comfortable as its wh j capability admitted. At Jeddah I felt once more at home. acti The sight of the sea acted as a tonic.

The Moslems politely assented to the first, but denied the second part of the proposition. Mr. Cole promised himself a laugh at the Turks' beards; but since my departure, he wrote to me that the subject made the owners look so serious, that he did not like recurring to it. Truly gratifying to the pride of an Englishman was our high official position assumed and maintained at Jeddah. Mr. Cole had never, like his colleague at Cairo, lowered himself in the estimation of the proud race with which he has to deal, by private or mercantile trans actions with the authorities. He has steadily withstood the wrath of the Meccan Sharif, and taught him to respect the British name. The Abbe Hamilton ascribed the attentions of the Prince to ' the infinite respect which the Arabs entertain for Mr. Cole's straightforward way of doing business,—it was a delicate flattery addressed to him.' And the writer was right; honesty of purpose is never thrown away amongst these people. The general contrast between our Consular proceedings at Cairo and Jeddah is another proof of the advisability of selecting Indian officials to fill offices of trust at Oriental courts. They have lived amongst Easterns, and they know one Asiatic language, with many Asiatic customs ; and, chief merit of all, they have learned to assume a tone of com mand, without which, whatever may be thought of it in England, it is impossible to take the lead in the East. The ' home-bred ' diplomate is not only unconscious of the thousand traps everywhere laid for him, he even plays into the hands of his crafty antagonists by a cere monious politeness, which they interpret—taking ample care that the interpretation should spread—to be the effect of fear or of fraud. Jeddah 1 has been often described by modern pens. 1 Abulfeda writes the word ' Juddah,' and Mr. Lane, as well as268 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Burckhardt (in a.d. 1841) devoted a hundred pages of his two volumes to the unhappy capital of the Tihamat al- Hijaz, the lowlands of the mountain region. Later still, MM. Mari and Chedufau wrote upon the subject; and two other French travellers, MM. Galinier and Ferret, pub lished tables of the commerce in its present state, quoting as authority the celebrated Arabicist M. Fresnel. 1 These MM. Mari and Chedufau, adopt this form, which signifies a ' plain wanting water.' The water of Jeddah is still very scarce and bad; all who can afford it drink the produce of hill springs brought in skins by the Badawin. Ibn Jubayr mentions that outside the town were 360 old wells (?), dug, it is supposed by the Persians. 'Jeddah,' or ' Jiddah,' is the vulgar pronounciation ; and not a few of the learned call it ' Jaddah ' (the grandmother), in allusion to the legend of Eve's tomb. 1 In Chapters iii. and vi. of this work I have ventured some remarks upon the advisability of our being represented in Al-Hijaz by a Consul, and at Meccah by a native agent, till the day shall come when the tide of events forces us to occupy the mother-city of Al-Islam. My apology for reverting to these points must be the nature of an Englishman, who would everywhere see his nation ' second to none,' even at Jeddah. Yet, when we consider that from twenty-five to thirty vessels here arrive annually from India, and that the value of the trade is about twenty-five lacs of rupees, the matter may be thought worth attending to. The following ex tracts from a letter written to me by Mr. Cole shall conclude this part of my task ;— ' You must know, that in 1838 a commercial treaty was concluded be tween Great Britain and the Porte, specifying (amongst many other clauses here omitted),— ' 1. That all merchandise imported from English ports to Al-Hijaz should pay 4 per cent. duty. ' 2. That all merchandise imported by British subjects from countries not under the dominion of the Porte should likewise pay but 5 per cent. ' 3. That all goods exported from countries under the dominion of the Porte should pay 12 per cent., after a deduction of 16 per cent, from the market-value of the articles. ' 4. That all monopolies be abolished.' 'Now, when I arrived at Jeddah, the state of affairs was this. A monopoly had been established upon salt, and this weighed only upon our Anglo-Indian subjects, they being the sole purchasers. Five per cent, wasXXXIV.—To Jcddah. 269 have been translated by the author of ' Life in Abyssinia.' Abd al-Karim, writing in 1742, informs us that the French had a factory at Jeddah; and in 1760, when Bruce re visited the port, he found the East India Company in pos session of a post whence they dispersed their merchandise over the adjoining regions. But though the English were at an early epoch of their appearance in the East received here with especial favour, I failed to procure a single ancient document. Jeddah, when I visited it, was in a state of commo tion, owing to the perpetual passage of pilgrims, and pro visions were for the same reason scarce and dear. The two large Wakalahs, of which the place boasts, were crowded with travellers, and many were reduced to en camping upon the squares. Another subject of confusion was the state of the soldiery. The Nizam, or Regulars, had not been paid for seven months, and the Arnauts could scarcely sum up what was owing to them. East erns are wonderfully amenable to discipline; a European army, under the circumstances, would probably have helped itself. But the Pasha knew that there is a limit to a man's endurance, and he was anxiously casting about for some contrivance that would replenish the empty pouches of his troops. The worried dignitary must have sighed for those beaux jours when privily firing the town and allowing the soldiers to plunder, was the Oriental style of settling arrears of pay. 1 levied upon full value of goods, no deduction of the 20 per cent, being allowed; the same was the case with exports; and most vexatious of all, various charges had been established by the local authorities, under the names of boat-hire, weighing, brokerage, &amp;c., &amp;c. The duties had thus been raised from 4 to at least 8 per cent. • • * This being represented at Constantinople, brought a peremptory Firman, ordering the governor to act up to the treaty letter by letter. * * * I have had the satisfaction to rectify the abuses of sixteen years' standing during my first few months of office, but I expect all manner of difficulties in claiming reimbursement for the over-exactions.' 1 M. Rochet {soi-disant d'Hericourt) amusingly describes this manoeuvre of the governor of Al-Hodaydah.270 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Jeddah displays all the license of a seaport and gar- you rison town. Fair Corinthians establish themselves even em j within earshot of the Karakun, or guard-post; a symptom the of excessive laxity in the authorities, for it is the duty of S pn the watch to visit all such irregularities with a bastinado a d preparatory to confinement. My guardians and attend- w hi ants at the Wakalah used to fetch Araki in a clear glass littl bottle, without even the decency of a cloth, and the mes- pla( senger twice returned from these errands decidedly drunk. swe More extraordinary still, the people seemed to take no pas notice of the scandal. to f The little 'Dwarka' had been sent by the Bombay I oj Steam Navigation Company to convey pilgrims from Al- by Hijaz to India. I was still hesitating about my next all voyage, not wishing to coast the Red Sea in this season we; without a companion, when one morning Omar Effendi yoi appeared at the door, weary, and dragging after him an enc ass more weary than himself. We supplied him with a pipe and a cup of hot tea, and, as he was fearful of pur- S er suit, we showed him a dark hole full of grass under which son he might sleep concealed. tev The student's fears were realised; his father appeared did early the next morning, and having ascertained from the s tri porter that the fugitive was in the house, politely called upon me. Whilst he plied all manner of questions, his tin black slave furtively stared at everything in and about utr the room. But we had found time to cover the runaway hrj with grass, and the old gentleman departed, after a fruit- sec less search. There was, however, a grim smile about his a ft, mouth which boded no good. wo That evening, returning home from the Hammam, I a &lt; found the house in an uproar. The boy Mohammed, who aft had been miserably mauled, was furious with rage; and the Shaykh Nur was equally unmanageable, by reason of his SU ; fear. In my absence the father had returned with a past ttu comitatus of friends and relatives. They questioned the isXXXIV.—To Jeddah. 271 youth, who delivered himself of many circumstantial and emphatic mis-statements. Then they proceeded to open the boxes ; upon which the boy Mohammed cast himself sprawling, with a vow to die rather than to endure such a disgrace. This procured for him some scattered slaps, which presently became a storm of blows, when a prying little boy discovered Omar Effendi's leg in the hiding- place. The student was led away unresisting, but mildly swearing that he would allow no opportunity of escape to pass. I examined the boy Mohammed, and was pleased to find that he was not seriously hurt. To pacify his mind, I offered to sally out with him, and to rescue Omar Effendi by main force. This, which would only have brought us all into a brunt with quarterstaves, and similar servile weapons, was declined, as had been foreseen. But the youth recovered complacency, and a few well-merited encomiums upon his ' pluck ' restored him to high spirits. The reader must not fancy such escapade to be a serious thing in Arabia. The father did not punish his son ; he merely bargained with him to return home for a few days before starting to Egypt. This the young man did, and shortly afterwards I met him unexpectedly in the streets of Cairo. Deprived of my companion, I resolved to waste no time in the Red Sea, but to return to Egypt with the utmost expedition. The boy Mohammed having laid in a large store of grain, purchased with my money, having secured all my disposable articles, and having hinted that, after my return to India, a present of twenty dollars would find him at Meccah, asked leave, and departed with a coolness for which I could not account. Some days afterwards Shaykh Nur explained the cause. I had taken the youth with me on board the steamer, where a bad suspicion crossed his mind. ' Now, I understand,' said the boy Mohammed to his fellow-servant, ' your master is a Sahib from India ; he hath laughed at our beards.'272 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. He parted as coolly from Shaykh Nur. These worthy youths had been drinking together, when Mohammed, having learned at Stambul the fashionable practice cf Bad-masti, or 'liquor-vice,' dug his 'fives' into Nur's eye. Nur erroneously considering such exercise likely tD induce blindness, complained to me ; but my sympathy was all with the other side. I asked the Hindi why he had not returned the compliment, and the Meccan once more overwhelmed the Miyan with taunt and jibe. It is not easy to pass the time at Jeddah. In thj square opposite to us was an unhappy idiot, who afforded us a melancholy spectacle. He delighted to wander about in a primitive state of toilette, as all such wretches do; but the people of Jeddah, far top civilised to retain Moslem respect for madness, forced him, despite shrieks and struggles, into a shirt, and when he tore it off they best him. At other times the open space before us was diversi fied by the arrival and the departure of pilgrims, but it was a mere rechauffe of the feast, and had lost all power to please. Whilst the boy Mohammed remained, he used to pass the time in wrangling with some Indians, who weie living next door to us, men, women, and children, in a promiscuous way. After his departure I used to spend my days at the Vice-Consulate ; the proceeding was net perhaps of the safest, but the temptation of meeting a fellow-countryman, and of chatting 'shop' about the service was too great to be resisted. I met there the prin cipal merchants of Jeddah ; Khwajah Sower, a Greek; M. Anton, a Christian from Baghdad, and others. 1 And I was introduced to Khalid Bey, brother of Abdullah bin Sa'ud, the Wahhabi. This noble Arab once held the 1 Many of them were afterwards victims to the ' Jeddah mass acre ' on June 30, 1858.

He is brave, frank, and unprejudiced, fond of Europeans, and a lover of pleasure. Should it be his fate to become chief of the tribe, a journey to Riyaz, and a visit to Central Arabia, will offer no difficulties to our travellers. I now proceed to the last of my visitations. Outside the town of Jeddah lies no less a personage than Sittna Haw- wa, the Mother of mankind. The boy Mohammed and I, mounting asses one evening, issued through the Meccan gate, and turned towards the North-East over a sandy plain. After half an hour's ride, amongst dirty huts and tattered coffee-hovels, we reached the enciente, and found the door closed. Presently a man came running with might from the town ; he was followed by two others ; and it struck me at the time they applied the key with peculiar empressement, and made inordinately low conges as we entered the enclosure of whitewashed walls. 'The Mother ' is supposed to lie, like a Moslemah, . fronting the Ka'abah, with her feet northwards, her head southwards, and her right cheek propped by her right hand. Whitewashed, and conspicuous to the voyager and traveller from afar, is a diminutive dome with an opening to the West; it is furnished as such places usually are in Al-Hijaz. Under it and in the centre is a square stone, planted upright and fancifully carved, to represent the omphalic region of the hu man frame. This, as well as the dome, is called Al-Surrah, or the navel. The ci- cerone directed me to kiss this manner The Surrah. of hieroglyph, which I did, thinking the while, that, under the circumstances, the salutation was quite uncalled-for. Having prayed here, and at the head, where a few young trees grow, we walked along the side of the two parallel dwarf walls which define the outlines of the body: they are about six paces apart, and between them, upon Eve's vol. n. 182y^ Pilgrimage to Al-Mudiiiah and Meccah, neck, are two tombs, occupied, I was told, by Osman Pasha and his son, who repaired the Mother's sepulchre, I could not help remarking to the boy Mohammed, that if our first parent measured a hundred and twenty paces from head to waist, and eighty from waist to heel, she must have presented much the appearance ot a duck To this the youth replied, flippantly, that he thanked his stars the Mother was underground, otherwise that men would lose their senses with fright. Ibn Jubayr (twelfth century) mentions only an old dome, 'built upon the place where Eve stopped on the way to Meccah.' Yet Al-Idrisi (a.d. 1154) declares Eves VOh10» C ■ j ^ * ltd l&gt;ACf* rM OS 1) 1HI H LAO .THifSiT TC:4B9 Plan of Eve's Tomb. grave to be at Jeddah. Abd al-Karim (1742) compares it to a parterre, with a little dome in the centre, and tie extremities ending in barriers of palisades; the circum ference was a hundred and ninety of his steps. Rooke's Travels we are told that the tomb is twenty feet long. Ali Bey, who twice visited Jeddah, makes no allu sion to it; we may therefore conclude that it had beea destroyed by the Wahhabis. Burckhardt, who, I needXXXIV.—To Jeddah. 275 scarcely say, has been carefully copied by our popular authors, was informed that it was a ' rude structure of stone, about four feet in length, two or three feet in height, and as many in breadth'; thus resembling the tomb of Noah, seen in the valley of Al-Buka'a in Syria. Bruce writes: 'Two days' journey from this place (? Meccah or Jeddah) Eve's grave, of green sods, about fifty yards in length, is shown to this day'; but the great trav eller probably never issued from the town-gates. And Sir W. Harris, who could not have visited the Holy Place, repeats, in 1840, that Eve's grave of green sod is still shown on the barren shore of the Red Sea.' The present structure is clearly modern; anciently, I was told at Jeddah, the sepulchre consisted of a stone at the head, a second at the feet, and the navel-dome. The idol of Jeddah, in the days of Arab litholatry, was called Sakhrah Tawilah, the Long Stone. May not this stone of Eve be the Moslemized revival of the old idolatry? It is to be observed that the Arabs, if the tombs be admitted as evidence, are inconsistent in their dimensions of the patriarchal stature. The sepulchre of Adam at the Masjid al-Khayf is, like that of Eve, gigantic. That of Noah at Al-Buka'a is a bit of Aqueduct thirty- eight paces long by one and a half wide. Job's tomb near Hulah (seven parasangs from Kerbela) is small. I have not seen the grave of Moses (south-east of the Red Sea), which is becoming known by the bitumen cups there sold to pilgrims. But Aaron's sepulchre in the Sinaitic peninsula is of moderate dimensions. On leaving the graveyard I offered the guardian a dollar, which he received with a remonstrance that a man of my dignity should give so paltry a fee. Nor was he at all contented -with the assurance that nothing more could be expected from an Afghan Darwaysh, however pious. Next day the boy Mohammed explained the276 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. man's empressement and disappointment,—I had been mis taken for the Pasha of Al-Madinah. ******** For a time my peregrinations ended. Worn out with fatigue, and the fatal fiery heat, I embarked (Sept. 26) on board the 'Dwarka'; experienced the greatest kindness from the commander and chief officer (Messrs. Wolley and Taylor); and, wondering the while how the Turkish pilgrims who crowded the vessel did not take the trouble to throw me overboard, in due time I arrived at Suez. And here, reader, we part. Bear with me while I conclude, in the words of a brother traveller, long gone, but not forgotten—Fa-hian—this Personal Narrative of my Journey to Al-Hijaz : 'I have been exposed to perils, and I have escaped from them; I have traversed the sea, and have not succumbed under the severest fatigues; anc my heart is moved with emotions of gratitude, that I have been permitted to effect the objects I had in view.' 1 1 The curious reader will find details concerning Patriarchal and Prophetical Tombs in ' Unexplored Syria,' i. 33—35APPENDIX I. OF IIAJJ, OR PILGRIMAGE. The word Hajj is explained by Moslem divines to mean ' Kasd,' or aspiration, and to express man's senti ment that he is but a wayfarer on earth wending towards another and a nobler world. This explains the origin and the belief that the greater the hardships the higher will be the reward of the pious wanderer. He is urged by the voice of his soul: ' O thou whotoilest so hard for worldly pleasures and perishable profit, wilt thou endure nothing to win a more lasting reward ?' Hence it is that pilgrim age is common to all old faiths. The Hindus still wan der to Egypt, to Tibet, and to the inhospitable Caucasus; the classic philosophers visited Egypt; the Jews annually flocked to Jerusalem; and the Tartars and Mongols— Buddhists—journey to distant Lamaserais. The spirit of pilgrimage was predominant in mediaeval Europe, and the processions of the Roman Catholic Church are, accord ing to her votaries, 1 modern memorials of the effete rite. Every Moslem is bound, under certain conditions, 2 1 M. Hue's 'Travels in Tartary.' 2 The two extremes, between which lie many gradations, are these. Abu Hanifah directs every Moslem and Moslemah to perform the pilgrimage if they have health and money for the road and for tha support of their families; moreover, he allows a deputy-pilgrim, whose expenses must be paid by the principal. Ibn Malik, on the contrary, enjoins every follower to visit Meccah, if able to walk, and to earn his bread on the way. As a general rule, in Al-Islam there are four Shurut al-Wujub, or necessary conditions, viz.:—280 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. to pay at least one visit to the Holy City. This consti tutes the Hajjat al-Farz (the one obligatory pilgrimage), ' or Hajjat al-Islam, of the Mohammedan faith. Repeti- 1 tions become mere Sunnats, or practices of the Prophet, and are therefore supererogatory. Some European writers have of late years laboured to represent the Meccan pil grimage as a fair, a pretext to collect merchants and to afford Arabia the benefits of purchase and barter. It would be vain to speculate whether the secular or the spiritual element originally prevailed; but most probably each had its portion. But those who peruse this volume will see that, despite the comparatively lukewarm piety of the age, the Meccan pilgrimage is religious essentially, accidentally an affair of commerce. Moslem pilgrimage is of three kinds. 1. Al-Mukarinah (the uniting) is when the votary performs the Hajj and the Umrah 1 together, as was done by the Prophet in his last visit to Meccah. 2. Al-Ifrad (singulation) is when either the Hajj or the Umrah is performed singularly, the former preceding the latter. The pilgrim may be either Al-Mufrid b'il Haj; 1. Islam, the being a Moslem. 2. Bulugh, adolescence. 3. Hurriyat, the being a free man. 4. Akl, or mental sanity. Other authorities increase the conditions to eight, viz.;— 5. Wujud al-Zad, sufficiency of provision. 6. Al-Rahlah, having a beast of burthen, if living two days' journey from Meccah. 7. Takhliyat al-Tarik, the road being open; and 8. Imkan al-Masir, the being able to walk two stages, if the pilgrin hath no beast. Others, again, include all conditions under two heads:— 1. Sihhat, health. 2. Istita'at, ability. These subjects have exercised not a little the casuistic talents of the Arab doctors: a folio volume might be filled with differences of opinion on the subject, ' Is a blind man sound ?' 1 The technical meaning of these words will be explained below.Appendix I. — Of Hajj, or Pilgrimage. 281 (one who is performing only the Hajj), or vice versa, Al- Mufrid b'il Umrah. According to Abu Hanifah, this form is more efficacious than the following. 3. Al-Tamattu (' possession ') is when the pilgrim assumes the Ihram, and preserves it throughout the months of Shawwal, Zu'l Ka'adah, and nine days (ten nights) in Zu'l Hijjah, 1 performing Hajj and Umrah the while. There is another threefold division of pilgrimage:— 1. Umrah (the little pilgrimage), performed at any time except the pilgrimage season. It differs in some of its forms from Hajj, as will afterwards appear. 2. Hajj (or simple pilgrimage), performed at the pro per season. 3. Hajj al-Akbar (the great pilgrimage) is when the 'day of Arafat' happens to fall upon a Friday. This is a most auspicious occasion. M. Caussinde Perceval and other writers, departing from the practice of (modern ?) Islam, make ' Hajj al-Akbar ' to mean the simple pil grimage, in opposition to the Umrah, which they call 'Hajj al-Asghar.' The following compendium of the Shafe'i pilgrim-rites is translated from a little treatise by Mohammed of Shir- bin, surnamed Al-Khatib, a learned doctor, whose work is generally read in Egypt and in the countries adjoining. C hapter I.—O f P ilgrimage. 3 ' Know,' says the theologist, with scant preamble, 'that the acts of Al-Hajj, or pilgrimage, are of three kinds:— 1 At any other time of the year Ihram is considered Makruh, or objectionable, without being absolutely sinful. 2 In other books the following directions are given to the intended pilgrim:—Before leaving home he must pray two prostrations, concluding the orisons with a long supplication and blessings upon relatives, friends, and neighbours, and he must distribute not fewer than seven silver pieces to the poor. The day should be either a Thursday or a Saturday; some, however, say ' Allah hath honoured the Monday and the Thursday,'282 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. ' 1. Al-Arkan or Farayz; those made obligatory by Koranic precepts, and therefore essentially necessary, and not admitting expiatory or vicarious atonement, either in Hajj or Umrah. '2. Al-Wajibat (requisites); the omission of which may, according to some schools, 1 be compensated for by the Fidyat, or atoning sacrifice: and— ' 3. Al-Sunan (pi. of Sunnat), the practice of the Prophet, which may be departed from without positive sin. ' Now, the Arkan, the ' pillars' upon which the rite stands, are six in number, 2 viz.:— '1. Al-Ihram ('rendering unlawful'), or the wearing pilgrim garb and avoiding certain actions. '2. Al-Wukuf, the 'standing' upon Mount Arafat. '3. The Tawaf al-Ifazah, or circumambulation of im petuosity. 8 If possible, the first of the month should be chosen, and the hour early dawn. Moreover, the pilgrim should not start without a Rafik, or com panion, who should be a pious as well as a travelled man. The other Mukaddamat al-Safar, or preambles to journeying, are the following. Istikharah, consulting the rosary and friends. Khulus al-Niyat, vowing pilgrimage to the Lord (not for lucre or revenge). Settling worldly affairs, paying debts, drawing up a will, and making arrangements for the support of one's family. Hiring animals from a pious person. The best tnontm is a camel, because preferred by the Prophet; an ass is not commendable; a man should not walk if he can afford to ride; and the palanquin or litter is, according to some doctors, limited to invalids. Reciting long prayers when mounting, halting, dismounting, and at nightfall. On hills the Takbir should be used: the Tasbih is properest for vales and plains; and Meccah should be blessed when first sighted. Avoiding abuse, curses, or quarrels. Sleeping like the Prophet, namely, in early night (when prayer- hour is distant), with 'Iftirash,' or lying at length with the right cheek on the palm of the dexter hand; and near dawn with 'Ittaka,' ». e. propping the head upon the hand, with the arm resting upon the elbow. And, lastly, travelling with collyrium-pot, looking-glass and comb, needle and thread for sewing, scissors and tooth-stick, staff and razor. 1 In the Shafe'i school there is little difference between Al-Farz and Al- Wajib. In the Hanafi the former is a superior obligation to the latter. 2 The Hanafi, Maliki, and even some Shafe'i doctors, reduce the number from six to four, viz.:— 1. Ihram, with 'Niyat.' 3- Wukuf. 2. Tawaf. 4- Sai. 3 The Ifazah is the impetuous descent from Mount Arafat. Its Tawaf, generally called Tawaf al-Ziyarat, less commonly Tawaf al-Sadr or TawafAppendix I.—Of Hajj, or Pilgrimage. 283 '4. The Sai, or course between Mounts Safa and Marwah. '5. Al-Halk; tonsure (of the whole or part) of the head for men; or taksir, cutting the hair (for men or women). 1 '6. Al-Tartib, or the due order of the ceremonies, as above enumerated. 'But Al-Sai (4), may either precede or follow Al-Wukuf (2), provided that the Tawaf al-Kudum, or the circumambula- tion of arrival, has previously been performed. And Halk (5) may be done before as well as after the Tawaf al-Ifazah (3). ' Now, the Wajibat (requisites of pilgrimage, also called 'Nusuk') are five in number, viz.:— ' 1. Al-Ihram, or assuming pilgrim garb, from the Mikat, or fixed limit. 2 '2. The Mabit, or nighting at Muzdalifah: for this a short portion, generally in the latter watch, preceding the Yaum al- Nahr, or victim-day, suffices. '3. The spending at Muna the three nights of the 'Ayyam al-Tashrik,' or days of drying flesh: of these, the first is the most important. '4. The Rami al-Jimar, or casting stones at the devil; and— '5. The avoiding of all things forbidden to the pilgrim when in a state of Ihram. 'Some writers reduce these requisites by omitting the second and third. The Tawaf al-Wida'a, or the circumambula- tion of farewell, is a 'Wajib Mustakill,' or particular requisite, which may, however, be omitted without prejudice to pilgrimage. ' Finally, the Sunnat of pilgrimage are many in number. Of these I enumerate but a few. 'Hajj' should precede 'Umrah.' The 'Talbiyat' should be frequently ejaculated. The 'Tawaf al-Kudum' must be performed on arrival at Meccah, before pro ceeding to Mount Arafat. 8 The two-bow prayer should follow al-Nuzul, is that performed immediately after throwing the stones and resuming the laical dress on the victim-day at Mount Muna. 1 Shaving is better for men, cutting for women. A razor must be passed over the bald head; but it is sufficient to burn, pluck, shave, or clip three hairs when the chevelure is long. 2 The known Mikat are: North, Zu'l Halifah; North-East, Karn al- Manazil; North-West, Al-Juhfah (^ h P ) South, Yalamlam ; East, Zat Irk, 3 This Tawaf is described in chapter v.284 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Tawaf. A whole night should be passed at Muzdalifah and Muna. 1 The circumambulation of farewell must not be for gotten, 2 and the pilgrim should avoid all sewn clothes, even slippers.' Section I.— Of Ihratn. 'Before doffing his laical garment, the pilgrim performs a total ablution, shaves, and perfumes himself. He then puts on a ' Rida' and an ' Izar, 8 ' both new, clean, and of a white colour: after which he performs a two-bow prayer (the ' Sunnat' of Al- Ihram), with a so^o-wcc Niyat, specifying which rite he intends.' 'When Muhrim (i.e. in Ihram), the Moslem is forbidden (unless in case of sickness, necessity, over-heat, or unendurable cold, when a victim must expiate the transgression),— ' 1. To cover his head with aught which may be deemed a covering, as a cap or turband; but he may carry an umbrella, dive under water, stand in the.shade, and even place his hands upon his head. A woman may wear sewn clothes, white or light blue (not black), but her face-veil should be kept at a distance from her face. '2. To wear anything sewn or with seams, as shirt, trowsers, or slippers; anything knotted or woven, as chain- armour ; but the pilgrim may use, for instance, a torn-up shirt or trowscrs bound round his loins or thrown over his shoulders, he may knot his ' Izar,' and tie it with a cord, and he may gird his waist. ' 3. To knot the Rida, or shoulder-cloth. 6 1 Generally speaking, as will afterwards be shown, the pilgrims pass straight through Muzdalifah, and spend the night at Muna. 2 The 'Tawaf al-Wida'a' is considered a solemn occasion. The pilgrim first performs circumambulation. He drinks the waters of Zemzem, kisses the Ka'abah threshold, and stands for some time with his face and body pressed against the Multazem. There, on clinging to the curtain of the Ka'abah, he performs Takbir, Tahlil, Tahmid, and blesses the Prophet, weeping, if possible, but certainly groaning. He then leaves the Mosque, backing out of it with tears and lamentations, till he reaches the ' Bab al- Wida'a,' whence, with a parting glance at the Bayt Ullah, he wends his way home. 3 See chapter v. 4 Many pronounce this Niyat. If intending to perform pilgrimage, the devotee, standing, before prayer says, 'I vow this intention of Hajj to Allah the most High.' 5 In spite of this interdiction, pilgrims generally, for convenience, knot their shoulder-clothes under the right arm.Appendix I.—Of Hajj t or Pilgrimage. 285 '4. To deviate from absolute chastity, even kissing being forbidden to the Muhrim. Marriage cannot be contracted during the pilgrimage season. '5* To use perfumes, oil, curling the locks, or removing the nails and hair by paring, cutting, plucking, or burning. The nails may be employed to remove pediculi from the hair and clothes, but with care, that no pile fall off. '6. To hunt wild animals, or to kill those which were such originally. But he may destroy the ' five noxious,'—a kite, a crow, a rat, a scorpion, and a dog given to biting. He must not cut down a tree, 1 or pluck up a self-growing plant; but he is permitted to reap and to cut grass. ' It is meritorious for the pilgrim often to raise the 'Talbiyat' cry (for which see p. 140 ante). ' ' Labbayk' Allahumma Labbayk'! Li Sharika laka Labbayk'! Inna '1 hamda wa '1 ni'amata laka w'al mulk! La Sharika laka, Labbayk.' 2 'When assuming the pilgrim-garb, and before entering Meccah, 'Ghusl,' or total ablution, should be performed; but if water be not procurable, the Tayammum, or sand ablution, suffices. The pilgrim should enter the Holy City by day and on foot. When his glance falls upon the Ka'abah he should say, '0 Allah, increase this (Thy) house in degree, and greatness, and honour, and awfulness, and increase all those who have honoured it and glorified it, the Hajis and the Mutamirs (Umrah-performers), with degree, and greatness, and honour, and dignity!' Entering the outer Bab al-Salam, he must exclaim, ' O Allah, Thou art the Safety, and from Thee is the Safety 1' And then passing into the Mosque, he should repair to the 4 Black Stone,' touch it with his right hand, kiss it, and commence his circumambulation. 8 1 Hunting, killing, or maiming beasts in Sanctuary land and cutting down trees, are acts equally forbidden to the Muhrim and the Muhill (the Moslem in his normal state). For a large tree a camel, for a small one a sheep, must be sacrificed. 2 See chapter v. After the 'Talbiyat' the pilgrim should bless the Prophet, and beg from Allah paradise and protection from hell, saying, 'O Allah, by thy mercy spare us from the pains of hell-fire!' 3Most of these injunctions are 'meritorious,' and may therefore omitted without prejudice to the ceremony. 5, knotpray ( 286 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. ' Now, the victims of Al-Ihram are five in number, viz.:— ' Niyat, ' 1. The 'Victim of Requisites,' when a pilgrim accidentally or for or willingly omits to perform a requisite, such as the assump tion of the pilgrim garb at the proper place. This victim is a to sheep, sacrificed at the Id al-Kurban (in addition to the usual 'h e ^ offering), 1 or, in lieu of it, ten days' fast—three of them in the uP on Hajj season (viz. on the 6th, 7th, and 8th days of Zu'l Hijjah) and seven after returning home. '2. The 'Victim of Luxuries,' (Turfah), such as shaving the head or using perfumes. This is a sheep, or a three days' fast, or alms, consisting of three sd'a measures of grain, dis tributed among six paupers. '3. The 'Victim of suddenly returning to Laical Life'; that is to say, before the proper time. It is also a sheep, after the sacrifice of which the pilgrim shaves his head. '4. The 'Victim of killing Game.' If the animal slain be one for which the tame equivalents be procurable (a camel for an ostrich, a cow for a wild ass or cow, and a goat for a gazelle), the pilgrim should sacrifice it, or distribute its value, or purchase with it grain for the poor, or fast one day for each ' Mudd' measure. If the equivalent be not procurable, the offender must buy its value of grain for alms-deeds, or fast a day for every measure. '5. The 'Victim of Incontinence.' This offering is either a male or a female camel 2 ; these failing, a cow or seven sheep, or the value of a camel in grain distributed to the poor, or a day's fast for each measure.' Section II.— Of Tawaf, or Circumamhulation. 'Of this ceremony there are five Wajibat, or requisites, viz.:—Concealing 'the shame, 8 ' as in prayer. Ceremonial purity of body, garments, and place. Circumambulation inside the Mosque. Seven circuits of the house. Commencement of circuit from the Black Stone. Circumambulating the house with the left shoulder presented to it.

One 3 Cu 6 -nt Ibrahim saw, in a vision, a speaker, who said to him, ' Allah orders rwah, thee to draw near him with a victim!' He awoke, and not comprehending ■ s till' the scope of the dream, took especial notice of it (^jj); hence the first day of pilgrimage is called Yaum al-Tarwiyah. The same speaker visited him on the next night, saying,' Sacrifice what is dearest to thee! From the Patriarch's knowing (i—) what the first vision meant, the be S iD second day is called Yaum Arafat. On the third night he was ordered to ;tailCC sacrifice Ismail; hence that day is called Yaum Nahr (of 'throat-cutting ). Drtant The English reader will bear in mind that the Moslem day begins at sun set. I believe that the origin of 'Tarwiyat' (which may mean carrying hie to water ') dates from the time of pagan Arabs, who spent that day in pro- viding themselves with the necessary. Yaum Arafat derives its name from the hill, and Yaum al-Nahr from the victims offered to the idols in the e steps Muna valley. 2 The present generation of pilgrims, finding the delay inconvenient, ; wholi always pass on to Arafat without halting, and generally arrive at the n. mountain late in the afternoon of the 8th, that is to say, the first day of VOL. II. I 9290 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. 'On the second day (gth), the ' Yaum Arafat,' after perform ing the early prayer at 4 Ghalas' (». e. when a man cannot see his neighbour's face) on Mount Sabir, near Muna, the pilgrim should start when the sun is risen, proceed to the 4 Mountain of Mercy,' encamp there, and after performing the noontide and afternoon devotions at Masjid Ibrahim, 1 joining and shortening them, 2 he should take his station upon the mountain, which is all standing ground. But the best position is that preferred^by the Prophet, near the great rocks lying at the lower slope of Arafat. He must be present at the sermon, 8 and be abundant in Talbiyat (supplication), Tahlil (recitations of the chapter 'Say he is the one God I' 4 ), and weeping, for that is the place for the outpouring of tears. There he should stay till sunset, and then decamp and return hastily to Muzdalifah, where he should pass a portion of the night. 5 After a visit to the Mosque 'Mashr al-Harim,' he should collect seven pebbles and proceed to Muna. 6 'Yaum al-Nahr, the third day of the pilgrimage (10th Zu'l Hijjah), is the great festival of the Moslem year. Amongst pilgrimage. Consequently, they pray the morning prayer of the 9th at Arafat. 1 This place will be described afterwards. 2 The Shafe'i when engaged on a journey which takes up a night and day, is allowed to shorten his prayers, and to 'join' the noon with the afternoon, and the evening with the night devotions; thus reducing the number of times from five to three per diem. The Hanafi school allows this on one day and on one occasion only, namely, on the ninth of Zu'l 1 Hijjah (arriving at Muzdalifah), when at the 'Isha' hour it prays the Maghib and the Isha prayers together, 3 If the pilgrim be too late for the sermon, his labour is irretrievably lost.—M. Caussin de Perceval (vol. iii. pp. 301-305) makes the Prophet to have preached from his camel Al-Kaswa on a platform at Mount Arafat before noon, and to have again addressed the people after the post-meridian prayers at the station Al-Sakharat. Mohammed's last pilgrimage, called by Moslems Hajjat al-Bilagh ('of perfection,' as completing the faith), Hajjat al-lslam, or Hajjat al-VVida'a ('of farewell'), is minutely described 1 by historians as the type and pattern of pilgrimage to all generations. 4 Ibn Abbas relates a tradition, that whoever recites this short chapter 11,000 times on the Arafat day, shall obtain from Allah all he desires, 5 Most schools prefer to sleep, as the Prophet did, at Muzdalifah, pray the night devotions there, and when the yellowness of the next dawa appears, collect the seven pebbles and proceed to Muna. The Shafe'i, how ever, generally leave Muzdalifah about midnight. 6 These places will be minutely described in a future chapter.Appendix I.—Of Hajj, ov Pilgrimage. 291 its many names, 1 'fd al-Kurban' is the best known, as expres sive of Ibrahim's sacrifice in lieu of Ismail. Most pilgrims, after casting stones at the Akabah, or ' Great Devil,' hurry to Meccah. Some enter the Ka'abah, whilst others content them selves with performing the Tawaf al-Ifazah, or circumambula- tion of impetuosity, round the house. 2 The pilgrim should then return to Muna, sacrifice a sheep, and sleep there. Strictly speaking, this day concludes the pilgrimage. 'The second set of 'trois jours,' namely, the nth, 8 the 12th, and the 13th of Zu'l Hijjah, are called Ayyam al-Tashrik, or the ' days of drying flesh in the sun.' The pilgrim should spend that time at Muna, 4 and each day throw seven pebbles at each of the three pillars. 5 'When throwing the stones, it is desirable that the pilgrim should cast them far from himself, although he is allowed to place them upon the pillar. The act also should be performed after the Zawal, or declension of the sun. The pilgrim should begin with the pillar near the Masjid al-Khayf, proceed to the Wusta, or central column, and end with the Akabah. If unable to cast the stones during the daytime, he is allowed to do it at night. 'The 'throwing' over:—The pilgrim returns to Meccah, and when his journey is fixed, performs the Tawaf al-Wida'a ('of farewell'). On this occasion it is a Sunnat to drink the waters of Zemzem, to enter the temple with more than usual 1 Id al-Kurban, or the Festival of Victims (known to the Turks as Kurban Bayram, to the Indians as Bakar-id, the Kine Fete), Id al- Zuha, 'of forenoon,' or Id al-Azha, 'of serene night.' The day is called Yaum al-Nahr, 'of throat-cutting.' 2 If the ceremony of 'Sai' has not been performed by the pilgrim after the circuit of arrival, he generally proceeds to it on this occasion. 3 This day is known in books as 'Yaum al-Karr,' because the pilgrims pass it in repose at Muna. 4 'The days of drying flesh,' because at this period pilgrims prepare provisions for their return, by cutting up their victims, and exposing to the sun large slices slung upon long lines of cord. The schools have introduced many modifications into the ceremonies of these three days. Some spend the whole time at Muna, and return to Meccah on the morning of the 13th. Others return on the 12th, especially when that day happens to fall upon a Friday. 5 As will afterwards appear, the number of stones and the way of throwing them vary greatly in the various schools.292 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. respect and reverence, and bidding it adieu, to depart from the Holy City.

The House of Allah 1 has been so fully described by my predecessors, that there is little inducement to attempt a new portrait. Readers, however, may desire a view of« the great sanctuary, and, indeed, without a plan and its. explanation, the ceremonies of the Harim would be scarcely intelligible. I will do homage to the memory of the accurate Burckhardt, and extract from his pages a description which shall be illustrated by a few notes. ' The Kaabah stands in an oblong square (enclosed by a great wall) 250 paces long, and 200 broad, 2 none of the sides of which runs quite in a straight line, though at first sight the whole appears to be of a regular shape, j This open square is enclosed on the eastern side by a colonnade. The pillars stand in a quadruple row ; they are ' three deep on the other sides, and are united by pointed arches, every four of which support a small dome plastered and whitened on the outside. These domes, according to Kotobeddyn, are 152 in number. 8 The. 1 'Bayt Ullah' (House of Allah) and 'Ka'abah,' i .e. cube (house), 'la maison carr6e,' are synonymous. 2 Ali Bey gives 536 feet g inches by 356 feet; my measurement isi 257 paces by 210. Most Moslem authors, reckoning by cubits, make 1 ' the parallelogram 404 by 310. 3 On each short side I counted 24 domes; on the long, 35. Tto would give a total of 118 along the cloisters. The Arabs reckon i»; all 152; viz., 24 on the East side, on the North 36, on the South 36,Appendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 295 illars are above twenty feet in height, and generally rom one foot and a half to one foot and three quarters in iameter ; but little regularity has been observed in regard to them. Some are of white marble, granite or porphyry; but the greater number are of common stone of the Meccah mountains. 1 El Fasy states the whole at 589, ind says they are all of marble excepting 126, which are if common stone, and three of composition. Kotobeddyn eckons 555, of which, according to him, 311 are of marble, nd the rest of the stone taken from the neighbouring lountains; but neither of these authors lived to see ie latest repairs of the Mosque, after the destruction ^ pasioned by a torrent in a.d. 1626. 2 Between every ree or four columns stands an octagonal one, about four it in thickness. On the east side are two shafts of ddish gray granite in one piece, and one fine grey (HDrphyry with slabs of white feldspath. On the north side is one red granite column, and one of fine-grained red porphyry; these are probably the columns which Koto beddyn states to have been brought from Egypt, and one on the Mosque corner, near the Zarurah minaret; 16 at the porch of the Bab al-Ziyadah; and 15 at the Bab Ibrahim. The shape of these domes is the usual ' Media-Naranja,' and the super stition of the Meccans informs the pilgrim that they cannot be counted. Books reckon 1352 pinnacles or battlements on the temple Wall. 1 The 'common stone of the Meccah mountains' is a fine grey granite, quarried principally from a hill near the Bab al-Shabayki, which furnished material for the Ka'abah. Eastern authors describe the pillars as consisting of three different substances, viz.: Rukham, white marble, not 'alabaster,' its general sense; Suwan, or granite (syenite?); and Hajar Shumaysi,' a kind of yellow sandstone, so called from 'Bir Shumays,' a place on the Jeddah road near Haddah, the half-way station. 2 I counted in the temple 554 pillars. It is, however, difficult to be accurate, as the four colonnades and the porticos about the two great gates are irregular; topographical observations, moreover, tnust here be made under difficulties. Ali Bey numbers them roughly at 'plus de 500 colonnes et pilastres.'296 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. principally from Akhmim (Panopolis), when the chief (Caliph) El Mohdy enlarged the Mosque in a. h. 163. Among the 450 or 500 columns which form the enclosure I found not any two capitals or bases exactly alike. The capitals are of coarse Saracen workmanship ; some of them, which had served for former buildings, by the ignorance of the workmen, have been placed upside down upon the shafts. I observed about half a dozen marble bases of good Grecian workmanship. A few of the marble columns bear Arabic or Cufic inscriptions, in which I read the dates 863 and 762 (a. h.). 1 A column on the east side exhibits a very ancient Cufic inscription, somewhat defaced, which I could neither read nor copy. Some of the columns are strengthened with broad iron rings or bands, 2 as in many other Saracen buildings of the East. They were first employed by Ibn Dhaher Berkouk, king of Egypt, in rebuilding the Mosque, which had been destroyed by fire in a. h. 802. 8 ' ' Some parts of the walls and arches are gaudily painted in stripes of yellow, red, and blue, as are also the minarets. Paintings of flowers, in the usual Muselman 1 The author afterwards informs us, that ' the temple has been so often ruined and repaired, that no traces of remote antiquity are to be found about it.' He mentions some modern and unimportant inscriptions upon the walls and over the gates. Knowing that many of the pillars were sent in ships from Syria and Egypt by the Caliph Al-Mahdi, a traveller would have expected better things. 2 The reason being, that 'those shafts formed of the Meccan stone are mostly in three pieces; but the marble shafts are in one piece.' 3 To this may be added, that the facades of the cloisters are twenty-four along the short walls, and thirty-six along the others; they have stone ornaments, not inaptly compared to the French 'fleur de lis.' The capital and bases of the outer pillars are grander and more regular than the inner; they support pointed arches, and the Arab secures his beloved variety by placing at every fourth arch a square pilaster. Of these there are on the long sides ten, on the short seven.Appendix II.—Tin Bayt Ullah. 297 style, are nowhere seen; the floors of the colonnades are paved with large stones badly cemented together.' 'Some paved causeways lead from the colonnades towards the Kaabah, or Holy House, in the centre. 1 They are of sufficient breadth to admit four or five persons to walk abreast, and they are elevated about nine inches above the ground. Between these causeways, which are covered with fine gravel or sand, grass appears growing in several places, produced by the Zem Zem water oozing out of the jars which are placed in the ground in long rows during the day. 2 There is a descent of eight or ten steps from the gates on the north side into the platform of the colonnade, and of three or four steps from the gates on the south side.' 'Towards the middle of this area stands the Kaabah; it is 115 paces from the north colonnade, and 88 from the south. For this want of symmetry we may readily account, the Kaabah having existed prior to the Mosque, which was built around it, and enlarged at different periods. The Kaabah is an oblong massive structure, 18 paces in length, 14 in breadth, and from 35 to 40 feet in height. 8 It is constructed of the grey Mekka stone, in large blocks of different sizes joined together, in a very 1 I counted eight, not including the broad pavement which leads from the Bab al-Ziyadah to the Ka'abah, or the four cross branches which connect the main lines. These ' Firash al-Hajar,' as they are called, also serve to partition off the area. One space for in stance is called ' Haswat al-Harim,' or the 'Women's sanded place,' because appropriated to female devotees. 2 The jars are little amphorae, each inscribed with the name of the donor and a peculiar cypher. 3 My measurements give 22 paces or 55 feet in length by 18 (45) of breadth, and the height appeared greater than the length. Ali Bey makes the Eastern side 37 French feet, 2 inches and 6 lines, the Western 38° 4' 6', the Northern 29 feet, the Southern 31 0 6', and the height 34 0 4'. He therefore calls it a 'veritable trapezium.' In Al-Idrisi's time it was 25 cubits by 24, and 27 cubits high.298 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. rough manner, with bad cement. 1 It was entirely rebuilt, as it now stands, in a.d. 1627. The torrent in the pre ceding year had thrown down three of its sides, and, pre paratory to its re-erection, the fourth side was, according to Asamy, pulled down, after the Olemas, or learned divines, had been consulted on the question whether mortals might be permitted to destroy any part of the holy edifice without incurring the charge of sacrilege and infidelity.' 'The Kaabah stands upon a base two feet in height, which presents a sharp inclined plane. 2 Its roof being flat, it has at a distance the appearance of a perfect cube. 8 The only door which affords entrance, and which is opened but two or three times in the year, 4 is on the 1 I would alter this sentence thus:—' It is built of fine grey granite in horizontal courses of masonry of irregular depth; the stones are tolerably fitted together, and are held by excellent mortar like Roman cement.' The lines are also straight. 2 This base is called Al-Shazarwan, from the Persian Shadar- wan, a cornice, eaves, or canopy. It is in pent-house shape, project ing about a foot beyond the wall, and composed of fine white marble slabs, polished like glass; there are two breaks in it, one opposite and under the doorway, and another in front of Ishmael's tomb. Pilgrims are directed, during circumambulation, to keep their bodies outside of the Shazarwan; this would imply it to be part of the building, but its only use appears in the large brass rings welded into it, for the purpose of holding down the Ka'abah covering. 3 Ali Bey also errs in describing the roof as ' plat endessus.' Were such the case, rain would not pour off with violence through the spout. Most Oriental authors allow a cubit of depression from South-West to North-West. In Al-Idrisi's day the Ka'abah had a double roof. Some say this is the case in the present building, which has not been materially altered in shape since its restoration by Al- Hajjaj, a.h. 83. The roof was then eighteen cubits long by fifteen broad. 4 In Ibn Jubayr's time the Ka'abah was opened every day in Rajab, and in other months on every Monday and Friday. The house may now be entered ten or twelve times a year gratis; and by pilgrims as often as they can collect, amongst parties, a sum sufficient to tempt the guardians' cupidity.Appendix II.—The Bayt Ullcih. 299 north side and about seven feet above the ground. 1 In the first periods of Islam, however, when it was rebuilt in a.h. 64 by Ibn Zebeyr (Zubayr), chief of Mecca, it had two doors even with the ground floor of the Mosque. 2 1 This mistake, in which Burckhardt is followed by all our popular authors, is the more extraordinary, as all Arabic authors call the door-wall Janib al-Mashrik—the Eastern side—or Wajh al-Bayt, the front of the house, opposed to Zahr al-Bayt, the back. Niebuhr is equally in error when he asserts that the door fronts to the South. Arabs always hold the ' Rukn al-Iraki,' or Irak angle, to face the polar star, and so it appears in Ali Bey's plan. The Ka'abah, there fore, has no Northern side. And it must be observed that Moslem writers dispose the length of the Ka'abah from East to \\ est, whereas our travellers make it from North to South. Ali Bey places the door only six feet from the pavement, but he calculates distances by the old French measure. It is about seven feet from the ground, and six from the corner of the Black Stone. Between the two the space of wall is called Al-Multazem (in Burckhardt, by a cleiical error, Al- Metzem,' vol. i. p. 173). It derives its name, the 'attached-to,' because here the circumambulator should apply his bosom, and beg pardon for his sins. Al-Multazem, according to M. de Perceval, fol- lowing d'Ohsson, was formerly 'le lieu des engagements, whence, according to him, its name, ' Le Moltezem,' says M. Galland (Kits et Ceremonies du P^lerinage de la Mecque), 'qui est entre la pierre noire et la porte, est I'endroit ou Mahomet se reconcilia avec ses dix compagnons, qui disaient qu'il n'etait pas veritablement Prophete. 2 From the Bab al-Ziyadah, or gate in the northern colonnade, you descend by two flights of steps, in all about twenty-five. This depression manifestly arises from the level of the town having been raised, like Rome, by successive layers of ruins ; the most populous and substantial quarters (as the Shamiyah to the north) would, we might expect, be the highest, and this is actually the case. But I am unable to account satisfactorily for the second hollow within the temple, and immediately around the house of Allah, where the door, according to all historians, formerly on a level with the pavement, and now about seven feet above it, shows the exact amount of depression, which cannot be accounted for simply by calcation. Some chroniclers assert, that when the Kuraysh rebuilt the house they raised the door to prevent devotees entering without their per mission. But seven feet would scarcely oppose an entrance, and how will this account for the floor of the building being also raised to that height above the pavement ? It is curious to observe the300 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. The present door (which, according to Azraky, was brought hither from Constantinople in a.d. 1633), is wholly coated with silver, and has several gilt ornaments; upon its threshold are placed every night various small lighted wax candles, and perfuming pans, filled with musk, aloe-wood, &amp;C. 1 ' 'At the north-east 2 corner of the Kaabah, near the door, is the famous 'Black Stone' 8 ; it forms a part of the similarity between this inner hollow of the Meccan fane and the arti ficial depression of the Hindu pagoda where it is intended to be flooded. The Hindus would also revere the form of the Meccan fane, exactly resembling their square temples, at whose corners are placed Brahma, Vishnu, Shiwa and Ganesha, who adore the great Universal Generator in the centre. The second door anciently stood on the side of the temple opposite the present entrance; inside, its place can still be traced. Ali Bey suspects its having existed in the modern building, and declares that the exterior surface of the wall shows the tracery of a blocked-up door, similar to that still open. Some histor ians declare that it was closed by the Kuraysh when they rebuilt the house in Mohammed's day, and that subsequent erections have had only one. The general opinion is, that Al-Hajjaj finally closed up the western entrance. Doctors also differ as to its size ; the popular measurement is three cubits broad and a little more than five in length. 1 Pilgrims and ignorant devotees collect the drippings of wax, the ashes of the aloe-wood, and the dust from the 'Atabah,'or threshold of the Ka'abah, either to rub upon their foreheads or to preserve as relics. These superstitious practices are sternly rebuked by the Olema. 2 For North-East read South-East. 3 I will not enter into the fabulous origin of the Hajar al-Aswad. Some of the traditions connected with it are truly absurd. ' When Allah,' says Ali, ' made covenant with the Sons of Adam on the Day of Fealty, he placed the paper inside the stone' ; it will, therefore, appear at the judgment, and bear witness to all who have touched it. Moslems agree that it was originally white, and became black by reason of men's sins. It appeared to me a common aerolite covered with a thick slaggy coating, glossy and pitch-like, worn and polished. Dr. Wilson, of Bombay, showed me a specimen in his possession, which externally appeared to be a black slag, with the inside of a bright and sparkling greyish-white, the result of admixture of nickelAppendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 301 with the iron. This might possibly, as the learned Orientalist then suggested, account for the mythic change of colour, its appearance on earth after a thunderstorm, and its being originally a material part of the heavens, Kutb al-Din expressly declares that, when the Karamitah restored it after twenty-two years to the Meccans, men kissed it and rubbed it upon their brows ; and remarked that the blackness was only superficial, the inside being white. Some Greek philosophers, it will be remembered, believed the heavens to be com posed of stones (Cosmos, ' Shooting Stars '): and Sanconiathon, ascribing the aerolite-worship to the god Coelus, declares them to be living or animated stones. ' The Arabians,' says Maximus of Tyre (Dissert. 38, p. 455), ' pay homage to I know not what god, which they represent by a quadrangular stone.' The gross fetichism of the Hindus, it is well known, introduced them to litholatry. At Jagannath they worship a pyramidal black stone, fabled to have fallen from heaven, or miraculously to have presented itself on the place where the temple now stands. Moreover, they revere the Salagram, as the emblem of Vishnu, the second person in their triad. The rudest emblem of the 'Bonus Deus' was a round stone. It was succeeded in India by the cone and triangle ; in Egypt by the pyramid ; in Greece it was represented by cones of terra-cotta about three inches and a half long. Without going deep into theory, it may be said that the Ka'abah and the Hajar are the only two idols which have survived the 360 composing the heavenly host of the Arab pantheon. Thus the Hindu poet exclaims :— ' Behold the marvels of my idol-temple, O Moslem ! That when its idols are destroy'd, it becomes Allah's House.' Wilford (As. Soc. vols. iii. and iv.) makes the Hindus declare that the Black Stone at Mokshesha, or Moksha-sthana (Meccah) was an incarnation of Moksheshwara, an incarnation of Shiwa, who with his consort visited Al-Hijaz. When the Ka'abah was rebuilt, this emblem was placed in the outer wall for contempt, but the people still respected it. In the Dabistan the Black Stone is said to be an image of Kaywan or Saturn ; and Al-Shahristani also declares the temple to have been dedicated to the same planet Zuhal, whose genius is represented in the Puranas as fierce, hideous, four-armed, and habited in a black cloak, with a dark turband. Moslem his torians are unanimous in asserting that Sasan, son of Babegan, and other Persian monarchs, gave rich presents to the Ka'abah; they especially mention vwo golden crescent moons, a significant offering. The Guebers assert chat, among the images and relics left by Mahabad and his successors in the Ka'abah, was the Black Stone, an emblem of Saturn. They ilso 'all the city Mahgah202 Pilygiuicigc to Al-Madinah and Mccccih. sharp angle of the building, 1 at four or five feet above the ground. 2 It is an irregular oval, about seven inches in diameter, with an undulating surface, composed of about a dozen smaller stones of different sizes and shapes, well joined to gether with a small quantity of cement, and perfectly well smooth ed : it looks as if the whole had been broken into many pieces by a ^ violent blow, and then united again, It is very difficult to determine ac curately the quality of this stone, which has been worn to its present surface by the million The Black stone, touches and kisses it has received. It appeared to me like a lava, containing several small extraneous particles of a whitish and of a yellowish substance. Its colour is now a deep reddish brown, approaching to black. It is surrounded on all sides by a border composed of a substance which I took to be a close cement moon's place—from an exceedingly beautiful image of the moon; •whence they say the Arabs derived ' Meccah.' And the Sabaeans equally respect the Ka'abah and the pyramids, which they assert to be the tombs of Seth, Enoch (or Hermes), and Sabi the son of Enoch. Meccah, then, is claimed zs a sacred place, and the Hajar al-Aswad, as well as the Ka'abah, are revered as holy emblems by four different faiths—the Hindu, Sabaean, Gueber, and Moslem. 1 have little doubt, and hope to prove at another time, that the Jews connected it with traditions about Abraham. This would be the fifth religion that looked towards the Ka'abah—a rare meeting-place of devotion. 1 Presenting this appearance in profile. The Hajar has suffered from the iconoclastic principle of Islam, having once narrowly escaped destruction by order of Al-Hakim of Egypt. In these days the metal rim serves as a protection as well as an ornament. 2 The height of the Hajar from the ground, according to my measurement, is four feet nine inches; Ali Bey places it forty -two inches above the pavementAppendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 303 of pitch and gravel of a similar, but not quite the same, brownish colour. 1 This border serves to support its detached pieces; it is two or three inches in breadth, and rises a little above the surface of the stone. Both the border and the stone itself are encircled by a silver band, 2 broader below than above, and on the two sides, with a considerable swelling below, as if a part of the stone were hidden under it. The lower part of the border is studded with silver nails.' 'In the south-east corner of the Kaabah, 8 or, as the Arab call it, Rokn al-Yemany, there is another stone about five feet from the ground; it is one foot and a half in length, and two inches in breadth, placed upright, and of the common Meccah stone. This the people walking round the Kaabah touch only with the right hand; they do not kiss it. 4 ' 1 The colour was black and metallic, and the centre of the stone was sunk about two inches below the metal circle. Round the sides was a reddish-brown cement, almost level with the metal, and sloping down to the middle of the stone. Ibn Jubayr declares the depth of the stone unknown, but that most people believe it to extend two cubits into the wall. In his day it was three 'Shibr' (the large span from the thumb to the little finger-tip) broad, and one span long, with knobs, and a joining of four pieces, which the Karamitah had broken. The stone was set in a silver band. 'Its softness and moisture were such,' says Ibn Jubayr, 'that the sinner would never remove his mouth from it, which phenomenon made the Prophet declare it to be the covenant of Allah on earth.' 2 The band is now a massive circle of gold or silver gilt. I found the aperture in which the stone is, one span and three fingers broad. 3 The ' Rukn al-Yamani' is the corner facing the South. The part alluded to in the text is the wall of the Ka'abah, between the Shami and Yamani angles, distant about three feet from the latter, and near the site of the old western door, long since closed. The stone is darker and redder than the rest of the wall. It is called Al-Mustajab (or Mustajab min al-Zunub or Mustajab al-Dua, ' where prayer is granted '). Pilgrims here extend their arms, press their bodies against the building, and beg pardon for their sins. 4 I have frequently seen it kissed by men and women.304 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. 'On the north side of the Kaabah, just by its door, 1 and close to the wall, is a slight hollow in the ground, lined with marble, and sufficiently large to admit of three persons sitting. Here it is thought meritorious to pray: the spot is called El Maajan, and supposed to be where Abraham and his son Ismail kneaded the chalk and mud which they used in building the Kaabah; and near this Maajan the former is said to have placed the large stone upon which he stood while working at the masonry. On the basis of the Kaabah, just over the Maajan, is an ancient Cufic inscription; but this I was unable to de cipher, and had no opportunity of copying it.' 'On the west (north-west) side of the Kaabah, about two feet below its summit, is the famous Myzab, or water-spout, 2 through which the rain-water collected on the roof of the building is discharged, so as to fall upon the ground; it is about four feet in length, and six inches in breadth, as well as I could judge from below, with borders equal in height to its breadth. At the 1 Al-Ma'ajan, the place of mixing or kneading, because the patriarchs here kneaded the mud used as cement in the holy building. Some call it Al-Hufrah (the digging), and it is generally known as Makam Jibrail (the place of Gabriel), because here descended the inspired order for the five daily prayers, and at this spot the Arch angel and the Prophet performed their devotions, making it a most auspicious spot. It is on the north of the door, from which it is distant about two feet; its length is seven spans and seven fingers; breadth five spans three fingers ; and depth one span four fingers. The following sentence from Herklet's 'Qanoon e Islam' (ch. xii. sec. 5) may serve to show the extent of error still popular. The author, after separating the Bayt Ullah from the Ka'abah, errone ously making the former the name of the whole temple, proceeds to say, ' the rain-water which falls on its (the Ka'abah's) terrace runs off through a golden spout on a stone near it, called Rookn-e-Yemtni, or alabaster-stone, and stands over the grave of Ismaeel.' ! 2 Generally called Mizab al-Rahmah (of Mercy). It carries rain from the roof, and discharges it upon Ishmael's grave, where pilgrims stand fighting to catch it. In Al-Idrisi's time it was of wood; now it is said to be gold, but it looks very dingy.Appendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 305 mouth hangs what is called the beard of the Myzab; a gilt board, over which the water flows. This spout was sent hither from Constantinople in a. h. 981, and is reported to be of pure gold. The pavement round the Kaabah, below the Myzab, was laid down in a.h. 826, and consists of various coloured stones, forming a very handsome specimen of mosaic. There are two large slabs of fine verdi aniico 1 in the centre, which, according to Makrizi, were sent thither, as presents from Cairo, in a.h. 241. This is the spot where, according to Mohammedan tradition, Ismayl the son of Ibrahim, and his mother Hajirah are buried; and here it is meritorious for the pilgrim to recite a prayer of two Rikats. On this side is a semicircular wall, the two extremities of which are in a line with the sides of the Kaabah, and distant from it three or four feet, 2 leaving an opening, which leads to the burial-place of Ismayl. The wall bears the name of El Hatym 3 ; and the area 1 Usually called the Hajar al-Akhzar, or green stone. Al-Idrisi speaks of a white stone covering Ishmael's remains ; Ibn Jubayr of 'green marble, longish, in form of a Mihrab arch, and near it a white round slab, in both of which are spots that make them appear yellow.' Near them, we are told, and towards the Iraki corner, is the tomb of Hagar, under a green slab one span and a half broad, and pilgrims used to pray at both places Ali Bey erroneously applies the words Al-Hajar Ismail to the parapet about the slab. 2 My measurements give five feet six .inches. In Al-Idrisi's day the wall was fifty cubits long. 3 Al-Hatim lit. the 'broken'). Burckhardt asserts that the Mekkawi no longer apply the word, as some historians do, to the space bounded by the Ka'abah, the Partition, the Zemzem, and the Makam of Ibrahim. I heard it, however, so used by learned Mec- cans, and they gave as the meaning of the name the break in this part of the oval pavement which surrounds the Ka'abah. Historians relate that all who rebuilt the ' House of Allah' followed Abraham's plan till the Kuraysh, and after them Al-Hajjaj| curtailed it in the direction of Al-Hatim, which part was then first broken off, and ever since remained so. vol . n. 20306 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. which it encloses is called Hedjer or Hedjer Ismayl, 1 on account of its being separated from the Kaabah: the wall itself also is sometimes so called.' ' Tradition says that the Kaabah once extended as far as the Hatym, and that this side having fallen down just at the time of the Hadj, the expenses of repairing it were demanded from the pilgrims, under a pretence that the revenues of government were not acquired in a manner sufficiently pure to admit of their application towards a purpose so sacred. The sum, however, obtained, proved very inadequate; all that could be done, therefore, was to raise a wall, which marked the space formerly occupied by the Kaabah. This tradition, although current among the Metowefs (cicerones) is at variance with history; which declares that the Hedjer was built by the Beni Koreish, who contracted the dimensions of the Kaabah; that it was united to the building by Hadjadj,' and again separated from it by Ibn Zebeyr. It is asserted by Fasy, that a part of the Hedjer as it now stands was never compre hended within the Kaabah. The law regards it as a portion of the Kaabah, inasmuch as it is esteemed equally meritorious to pray in the Hedjer as in the Kaabah itself; and the pilgrims who have not an oppor tunity of entering the latter are permitted to affirm upon oath that they have prayed in the Kaabah, although they have only prostrated themselves within the enclosure of the Hatym. The wall is built of solid stone, about five feet in height, and four in thickness, cased all over with white marble, and inscribed with prayers and invocations 1 Al-Hijr ( ^IT ) is the space separated, as the name denotes, from the Ka'abah. Some suppose that Abraham here penned his sheep. Possibly Ali Bey means this part of the Temple when he speaks of Al-Hajar (j ^T ) Ismail—lespierres d'Ismail. 2 ' Al-Hajjaj' ; this, as will afterwards be seen, is a mistake.

The walk round the Ka'abah is performed on the outside of the wall—the nearer to it the better.' ' Round the Kaabah is a good pavement of marble s about eight inches below the level of the great square; it was laid in a.h. 981, by order of the sultan, and describes an irregular oval; it is surrounded by thirty-two slender gilt pillars, or rather poles, between every two of which are suspended seven glass lamps, always lighted after sun set.® Beyond the poles is a second pavement, about eight paces broad, somewhat elevated above the first, but of coarser work; then another six inches higher, and eighteen paces broad, upon which stand several small buildings; beyond this is the gravelled ground ; so that two broad steps may be said to lead from the square down to the Kaabah. The small buildings just mentioned which sur round the Kaabah are the five Makams, 4 with the well 1 As well as memory serves me, for I have preserved no note, the inscriptions are in the marble casing, and indeed no other stone meets the eye. 2 It is a fine, close, grey polished granite: the walk is called Al-Mataf, or the place of circumambulation. 3 These are now iron posts, very numerous, supporting cross rods, and of tolerably elegant shape. In Ali Bey's time there were ' trente-une colonnes minces en piliers en bronze.' Some native works say thirty-three, including two marble columns. Between each two hang several white or green glass globe-lamps, with wicks and oil floating on water ; their light is faint and dismal. The whole of the lamps in the Harim is said to be more than 1000, yet they serve but to ' make darkness visible.' 4 There are only four ' Makams,' the Hanafi, Maliki, Hanbali, and the Makam Ibrahim ; and there is some error of diction below, for in these it is that the Imams stand before their congregations, and nearest the Ka'abah. In Ibn Jubayr's time the Zaydi sect was allowed an Imam, though known to be schismatics and abusers of the caliphs. Now, not being permitted to have a separate station308 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. of Zem Zem, the arch called Bab es Salam, and the Mambar.' ' Opposite the four sides of the Kaabah stand four other small buildings, where the Imaums of the orthodox Mohammedan sects, the Hanefy, Shafey, Hanbaly, and Maleky take their station, and guide the congregation in their prayers. The Makam el Maleky on the south, and that of Hanbaly opposite the Black Stone, are small pavilions open on all sides, and supported by four slender pillars, with a light sloping roof, terminating in a point, exactly in the style of Indian pagodas. 1 The Makam el Hanafy, which is the largest, being fifteen paces by eight, is open on all sides, and supported by twelve small pillars; it has an upper story, also open, where the Mueddin who calls to prayers takes his stand. This was built in a.h. 923, by Sultan Selim I.; it was afterwards rebuilt by Khoshgeldy, governor of Djidda, in 947; but all the four Makams, as they now stand, were built in a.h. 1074. The Makam-es'-Shafey is over the well Zem Zem, to which it serves as an upper chamber. 2 ' 'Near their respective Makams the adherents of the four different sects seat themselves for prayers. During my stay at Meccah the Hanefys always began their prayer first; but, according to Muselman custom, the Shafeys should pray first in the Mosque; then the Hanefys, Malekys, and Hanbalys. The prayer of the Maghreb is an exception, which they are all enjoined to utter to- for prayer, they suppose theirs to be suspended from heaven above the Ka'abah roof. 1 The Makam al-Maliki is on the west of, and thirty-seven cubits from, the Ka'abah ; that of the Hanbali forty-seven paces distant. 2 Only the Mu'ezzin takes his stand here, and the Shafe'is pray behind their Imam on the pavement round the Ka'abah, between the corner of the well Zemzem, and the Makam Ibrahim. This place is forty cubits from the Ka'abah, that is say, eight cubits nearer than the Northern and Southern ' Makams.' Thus the pavement forms an irregular oval ring round the houseAppendix II. — The Bayt Ullah, 309 the gether. The Makam el Hanbaly is the place where the officers of government and other great people are seated during prayers : here the Pasha and the sheriff are placed, and in their absence the eunuchs of the temple. These fill the space under this Makam in front, and behind it the female Hadjys who visit the temple have their places assigned, to which they repair principally for the two evening prayers, few of them being seen in the Mosque at the three other daily prayers; they also perform the Towaf, or walk round the Kaabah, but generally at night, though it is not uncommon to see them walking in the day-time among the men.' 'The present building which encloses Zem Zem stands close by the Makam Hanbaly, and was erected in a.h. 1072: it is of a square shape, and of massive con struction, with an entrance to the north, 2 opening into the room which contains the well. This room is beauti fully ornamented with marbles of various colours; and adjoining to it, but having a separate door, is a small room with a stone reservoir, which is always full of Zem Zem water. This the Hadjys get to drink by passing their hand with a cup through an iron grated opening, which serves as a window, into the reservoir, without enter ing the room. The mouth of the well is surrounded by a wall five feet in height and about ten feet n diameter. Upon this the people stand who draw up the water in leathern buckets, an iron railing being so placed as to 1 In Burckhardt's time the schools prayed according to the seniority of their founders, and they uttered the Azan of AI-Maghrib together, because that is a peculiarly delicate hour, which easily passes by unnoticed.

Now the Shaykh al-Mu'ezzin begins the call, which is taken up by the others. He is a Hanafi ; as indeed are all the principal people at Meccah, only a few wild Sharifs of the hills being Shafe'i. 2 The door of the Zemzem building fronts to the south-east.310 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. prevent their falling in. In El Fasy's time there were eight marble basins in this room, for the purpose of ab lution.' 'On the north-east (south-east) side of Zem Zero stand two small buildings, one behind the other, 1 called El Kobbateyn; they are covered by domes painted in the same manner as the Mosque, and in them are kept water- jars, lamps, carpets, mats, brooms, and other articles used in the very Mosque. 4 These two ugly buildings are in jurious to the interior appearance of the building, their heavy forms and structure being very disadvantageously contrasted with the light and airy shape of the Makams. I heard some Hadjys from Greece, men of better taste than the Arabs, express their regret that the Kobbateyn should be allowed to disfigure the Mosque. They were built by Khoshgeldy, governor of Djidda a.h. 947; one is called Kobbet el Abbas, from having been placed on the site of a small tank said to have been formed by Abbas, the uncle of Mohammed.' 1 This is not exactly correct. As the plan will show, the angle of one building touches the angle of its neighbour. 2 Their names and offices are now changed. One is called the Kubbat al-Sa'at, and contains the clocks and chronometers (two of them English) sent as presents to the Mosque by the Sultan. The other, known as the Kubbat al-Kutub, is used as a store-room for manuscripts bequeathed to the Mosque. They still are open to Burckhardt's just criticism, being nothing but the common dome springing from four walls, and vulgarly painted with bands of red, yellow, and green. In Ibn Jubayr's time the two domes contained bequests of books and candles. The Kubbat Abbas, or that further from the Ka'abah than its neighbour, was also called Kubbat al- Sharab (the Dome of Drink), because Zemzem water was here kept cooling for the use of pilgrims in Daurak, or earthen jars. The nearer was termed Kubbat al-Yahudi; and the tradition they told me was, that a Jew having refused to sell his house upon the spot, it was allowed to remain in loco by the Prophet, as a lasting testimony to his regard for justice. A similar tale is told of an old woman's hut, which was allowed to stand in the corner of the Great Nushirawan s royal halls.Appendix 11.—The Bayt Ullah. 311 were 'A few paces west (north-west) of Zem Zem, and 'f ab- directly opposite to the door of the Kaabah, stands a ladder or staircase, 1 which is moved up to the wall of the Zem Kaabah on days when that building is opened, and by :alled which the visitors ascend to the door.

The stone is said to have yielded under the weight of the Patriarch, and to preserve the impression of his foot still visible upon it; but no hadjy has ever seen it, 1 as the frame is always entirely covered with a brocade of red silk richly em broidered. Persons are constantly seen before the railing invoking the good offices of Ibrahim; and a short prayer must be uttered by the side of the Makam after the walk round the Kaabah is completed. It is said that many of the Sahaba, or first adherents of Mohammed, were in terred in the open space between this Makam and Zero Zem 3 ; from which circumstance it is one of the most 1 This I believe to be incorrect. I was asked five dollars for permission to enter; but the sum was too high for my finances. Learned men told me that the stone shows the impress of two feet, especially the big toes, and devout pilgrims fill the cavities with water, which they rub over their eyes and faces. When the Caliph al-Mahdi visited Meccah, one Abdullah bin Osman presented him- self at the unusual hour of noon, and informing the prince that he i had brought him a relic which no man but himself had yet seen, | produced this celebrated stone. Al-Mahdi, rejoicing greatly, kissed it, rubbed his face against it, and pouring water upon it, drank the draught. Kutb al-Din, one of the Meccan historians, says that it was j visited in his day. In Ali Bey's time it was covered with 'un magnifique drap noir brode en or et en argent avec de gros glands j en or he does not say, however, that he saw the stone. Its veils, j called Sitr Ibrahim al-Khalil, are a green ' Ibrisham,' or silk mixed with cotton and embroidered with gold. They are made at Cairo of three different colours, black, red, and green ; and one is devoted to each year. The gold embroidery is in the Sulsi character, and expresses the Throne-verse, the Chapter of the Cave, and the name of the reigning Sultan ; on the top is ' Allah.' below it 'Mohammed' ; be neath this is ' Ibrahim al-Khalil' ; and at each corner is the name of one of the four caliphs. In a note to the 'Dabistan' (vol. ii. p. 410). we find two learned Orientalists confounding the Black Stone with Abraham's Station or Platform. ' The Prophet honoured the Black Stone, upon which Abraham conversed with Hagar, to which he tied his camels, and upon which the traces of his feet are still seen.' .. 2 Not only here, I was told by learned Meccans, but under an the oval pavements surrounding the Ka'abah.Appendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 313 favourite places of prayers in the Mosque. In this part of the area the Khalif Soleyman Ibn Abd el Melek, brother of Wolyd (Al-Walid), built a fine reservoir in a.h. 97, which was filled from a spring east of Arafat 1 ; but the Mekkawys destroyed it after his death, on the pre tence that the water of Zem Zem was preferable.' 'On the side of Makam Ibrahim, facing the middle part of the front of the Kaabah, stands the Mambar, or pulpit of the Mosque ; it is elegantly formed of fine white marble, with many sculptured ornaments; and was sent as a present to the Mosque in a. h. 969 by Sultan Soley man Ibn Selym. 2 A straight, narrow staircase leads up to the post of the Khatyb, or preacher, which is sur mounted by a gilt polygonal pointed steeple, resembling an obelisk. Here a sermon is preached on Fridays and on certain festivals. These, like the Friday sermons of all Mosques in the Mohammedan countries, are usually of the same turn, with some slight alterations upon extraordinary occasions. 8 ' ' I have now described all the buildings within the inclosure of the temple.'

The eastern gates are the Greater Bab al-Salam, through which the pilgrim enters the Mosque; it is close to the north-east angle. Next to it the Lesser Bab al- Salam, with two small arches; thirdly, the Bab al-Nabi, where the Prophet used to pass through from Khadijah's house; and, lastly, near the south-east corner, the Bab Ali, or of the Benu Hashim, opening upon the street between Safa and Marwah. Beyond the north-eastern corner, in the northern wall, is the Bab Duraybah, a small entrance with one arch. Next to it, almost fronting the Ka'abah, is the grand adit, 'Bab al-Ziyadah,' also known as Bab al- Nadwah. Here the colonnade, projecting far beyond the normal line, forms a small square or hall supported by pillars, and a false colonnade of sixty-one columns leads to the true cloister of the Mosque. This portion of the building being cool and shady, is crowded by the poor, the diseased, and the dying, during Divine worship, and at other times by idlers, schoolboys, and merchants. Passing through three external arches, pilgrims descend by a flight of steps into the hall, where they deposit their slippers, it not being considered decorous to hold them when circumambulating the Ka'abah. 1 A broad pavement, in the shape of an irregular triangle, whose base is the cloister, leads to the circuit of the house. Next to the Ziyadah Gate is a small, single-arched entrance, 44 Bab Kutubi,' and beyond it one similar, the Bab al-Ajlah also named Al-Basitiyah, from its proximity to the college of Abd al-Basitah. Close to the north-west angle of the cloister is the Bab al- Nadwah, anciently called Bab al-Umrah, and now Bab 1 An old pair of slippers is here what the ' shocking bad hat ' is at a crowded house in Europe, a self-preserver.

Near this place and opening into the Ka'abah, stood the 'Town Hall' (Dar al-Nadwah), built by Kusay, for containing the oriflamme 'Al-Liwa,' and as a council-chamber for the ancients of the city. 1 In the western wall are three entrances. The single-arched gate nearest to the north angle is called Bab Benu Saham or Bab al-Umrah, because pilgrims pass through it to the Tanim and to the ceremony Al-Umrah (Little Pilgrimage). In the centre of the wall is the Bab Ibrahim, or Bab al-Khayyatin (the Tailors' Gate); a single arch leading into a large projecting square, like that of the Ziyadah entrance, but somewhat smaller. Near the south-west corner is a double arched adit, the Bab al-Wida'a (' of farewell'): hence departing pilgrims issue forth from the temple. At the western end of the southern wall is the two- arched Bab Umm Hani, so called after the lady's residence, when included in the Mosque. Next to it is a similar building, 'Bab Ujlan' which derives its name from the large college 'Madrasat Ujlan'; some call it Bab al-Sharif, because it is opposite one of the palaces. After which, and also pierced with two arches, is the Bab al-Jiyad (some erroneously spell it Al-Jihad, 'of War'), the gate leading to Jabal Jiyad. The next is double arched, and called the Bab al-Mujahid or Al- Rahmah ('of Mercy'). Nearly opposite the Ka'abah, and connected with the pavement by a raised line of stone, is the Bab al-Safa, through which pilgrims now issue to perform the ceremony 'Al-Sai'; it is a small and unconspicuous erection. Next to it is the Bab al- Baghlah with two arches, and close to the south-east angle of the Mosque the Bab Yunus, alias Bab Bazan, alias Bab al-Zayt, alias Bab al-Asharah ('of the ten'), because a favourite with the first ten Sahabah, or Com- i Many authorities place this building upon the site of the modern Makam Hanafi.Appendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 317 panions of the Prophet. 'Most of these gates,' says Burckhardt, 'have high pointed arches; but a few round arches are seen among them, which, like all arches of this kind in the Hejar, are nearly semi-circular. They are without ornament, except the inscription on the exterior, which commemorates the name of the builder, and they are all posterior in date to the fourteenth cen tury. As each gate consists of two or three arches, or divisions, separated by narrow walls, these divisions are counted in the enumeration of the gates leading into the Kaabah, and they make up the number thirty-nine. There being no doors to the gates, the Mosque is con sequently open at all times. I have crossed at every hour of the night, and always found people there, either at prayers or walking about. 1 ' ' The outside walls of the Mosques are those of the houses which surround it on all sides. These houses belonged originally to the Mosque ; the greater part are now the property of individuals. They are let out to the richest Hadjys, at very high prices, as much as 500 piastres being given during the pilgrimage for a good apartment with windows opening into the Mosque. 2 Windows have in consequence been opened in many parts of the walls on a level with the street, and above that of the floor of the colonnades. Hadjys living in these apartments are allowed to perform the Friday's prayers at home; because, having the Kaabah in view from the windows, they are supposed to be in the Mosque itself, and to join in prayer those assembled within the 1 The Meccans love to boast that at no hour of the day or night is the Ka'abah ever seen without a devotee to perform ' Tawaf.' 2 This would be about 50 dollars, whereas 25 is a fair sum for a single apartment. Like English lodging-house-keepers, the Meccans make the season pay for the year. In Burckhardt's time the colon- nato was worth from 9 to 12 piastres; the value of the latter coin is now greatly decreased, for 28 go to the Spanish dollar all over Al- Hijaz.318 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. temple. Upon a level with the ground floor of the colon- atta nades and opening into them are small apartments formed reac in the walls, having the appearance of dungeons; these han have remained the property of the Mosque while the vice houses above them belong to private individuals.

The Naib al-Harim, or vice-intendant, is one Sayyid Ali, said to be of Indian extraction ; he is superior to all the attendants. There are about eighty eunuchs, whose chief, Sarur Agha, was a slave of Mohammed Ali Pasha. Their pay varies from 100 to 1,000 piastres per mensem ; it is, however, inferior to the Madinah salaries. The Imams, Mu'ezzins, Khatibs, Zemzemis, &amp;c., &amp;c., are under their respective Shaykhs who are of the Olema. 1 Briefly to relate the history of the Ka'abah. The ' House of Allah' is supposed to have been built and rebuilt ten times. 1. The first origin of the idea is manifestly a sym bolical allusion to the angels standing before the Almighty and praising his name. When Allah, it is said, informed the celestial throng that he was about to send a vice gerent on earth, they deprecated the design. Being reproved with these words, ' God knoweth what ye know not,' and dreading the eternal anger, they compassed the Arsh, or throne, in adoration. Upon this Allah created the Bayt al-Ma'amur, four jasper pillers with a ruby roof, 1 I have illustrated this chapter, which otherwise might be un intelligible to many, by a plan of the Ka'abah (taken from Ali Bey al-Abbasi), which Burckhardt pronounced to be ' perfectly correct.' This author has not been duly appreciated. In the first place, his disguise was against him ; and, secondly, he was a spy of the French Government. According to Mr. Bankes, who had access to the original papers at Constantinople, Ali Bey was a Catalonian named Badia, and was suspected to have been of Jewish extraction. He claimed from Napoleon a reward for his services, returned to the East, and died, it is supposed, of poison in the Hauran, near Damascus. In the edition which I have consulted (Paris, 1814) the author labours to persuade the world by marking the days with their planet ary signs, &amp;c., &amp;C., that he is a real Oriental, but he perpetually be trays himself. Some years ago, accurate plans of the two Harims were made by order of the present Sultan. They are doubtless to be found amongst the archives at Constantinople320 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. and the angels circumambulated it, crying, ' Praise to Allah, and exalted be Allah, and there is no ilah but Allah, and Allah is omnipotent!' The Creator then ordered them to build a similar house for man on earth. This, according to Ali, took place 40, according to Abu Hurayrah, 2,000 years before the creation ; both authori ties, however, are agreed that the firmaments were spread above and the seven earths beneath this Bayt al- Ma'amur. 2. There is considerable contradiction concerning the second house. Ka'ab related that Allah sent down with Adam 1 a Khaymah, or tabernacle of hollow ruby, which the angels raised on stone pillars. This was also called Bayt al-Ma'amur. Adam received an order to compass it about; after which, he begged a reward for obedience, and was promised a pardon to himself and to all his progeny who repent. Others declare that Adam, expelled from Paradise, and lamenting that he no longer heard the prayers of the angels, was ordered by Allah to take the stones of five hills, Lebanon, Sinai, Tur Zayt (Olivet), Ararat, and Hira, which afforded the first stone. Gabriel, smiting his wing upon earth, opened a foundation to the seventh layer, and the position of the building is exactly below the heavenly Bayt al-Ma'amur,—a Moslem corruption of the legends concerning the heavenly and the earthly Jerusalem. Our First Father circumambulated it as he had seen the angels do, and was by them taught the for mula of prayer and the number of circuits. According to others, again, this second house was not erected till after the 'Angelic Foundation ' was destroyed by time. 3. The history of the third house is also somewhat 1 It must be remembered that the Moslems, like many of tk Jews, hold that Paradise was not on earth, but in the lowest firma ment, which is, as it were, a reflection of earth.Appendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 321 confused. When the Bayt al-Ma'amur, or, as others say, the tabernacle, was removed to heaven after Adam's death, a stone-and-mud building was placed in its stead by his son Shays (Seth). For this reason it is respected by the Sabaeans, or Christians of St. John, as well as by the Moslems. This Ka abah, according to some, was destroyed by the deluge, which materially altered its site. Others believe that it was raised to heaven. Others, again, declare that only the pillars supporting the heavenly tabernacle were allowed to remain. Most authorities agree in asserting that the Black Stone was stored up in Abu Kubays, whence that ' first created of mountains ' is called Al-Amin, ' the Honest.' 4. Abraham and his son were ordered to build the fourth house upon the old foundations: its materials, according to some, were taken from the five hills which supplied the second; others give the names Ohod, Kuds, Warka, Sinai, Hira, and a sixth, Abu Kubays. It was of irregular shape; 32 cubits from the Eastern to the Northern corner; 32 from North to West; 31 from West to South; 20from South to East; and only9 cubits high. There was no roof; two doors, level with the ground, were pierced in the Eastern and Western walls; and inside, on the right hand, near the present entrance, a hole for treas ure was dug. Gabriel restored the Black Stone, which Abraham, by his direction, placed in its present corner, as a sign where circumambulation is to begin ; and the patri arch then learned all the complicated rites of pilgrimage. When this house was completed, Abraham, by Allah's order, ascended Jabal Sabir, and called the world to visit the sanctified spot; and all earth's sons heard him, even those ' in their father's loins or in their mother's womb, from that day unto the day of resurrection.' 5. The Amalikah (descended from Imlik, great grand son of Sam, son of Noah), who first settled near Meccah, founded the fifth house. Al-Tabari and the Moslem V0L - '•322 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. historians generally made the erection of the Amalikah £ ron . to precede that of the Jurham; these, according to others, nort repaired the house which Abraham built. east 6. The sixth Ka'abah was built about the beginning . of the Christian era by the Benu Jurham, the children of Kahtan, fifth descendant from Noah. Ismail married, was according to the Moslems, a daughter of this tribe, Da'alah bint Muzaz (^U.) bin Omar, and abandoning thei] Hebrew, he began to speak Arabic (Ta arraba). Hence t j on his descendants are called Arabicized Arabs. After 0 £ r Ismail's death, which happened when he was 130 years c j 10s old, Sabit, the eldest of his twelve sons, became ' lord of amc the house.' He was succeeded by his maternal grand- ]y[ ai father Muzaz, and afterwards by his children. The Jur- j am ham inhabited the higher parts of Meccah, especially Jabal g en Ka'aka'an, so called from their clashing arms; whereas sout the Amalikah dwelt in the lower grounds, which obtained the name of Jiyad, from their generous horses. 7. Kusay bin Kilab, governor of Meccah and fifth forefather of the Prophet, built the seventh house, accord- w hi ( ing to Abraham's plan. He roofed it over with palm st 0] leaves, stocked it with idols, and persuaded his tribe to 0 f j settle near the Harim. obsl 8. Kusay's house was burnt down by a woman's censer, which accidentally set fire to the Kiswah, or cover- that ing, and the walls were destroyed by a torrent. A mer- buil chant-ship belonging to a Greek trader, called 'Bakum' Wh ((.yilj), being wrecked at Jeddah, afforded material for thai the roof, and the crew were employed as masons. The beei Kuraysh tribe, who rebuilt the house, failing in funds of stor pure money, curtailed its proportions by nearly seven taki cubits and called the omitted portion Al-Hatim. In cub digging the foundation they came to a green stone, like a ^ camel's hunch, which, struck with a pickaxe, sent forth , blinding lightning, and prevented further excavation. the] The Kuraysh, amongst other alterations, raised the walls destiAppendix II.—The Bayt Ullah. 323 from nine to eighteen cubits, built a staircase in the northern breadth, closed the western door and placed the eastern entrance above the ground, to prevent men enter ing without their leave. When the eighth house was being built Mohammed was in his twenty-fifth year. His surname of Al-Amin, the Honest, probably induced the tribes to make him their umpire for the decision of a dispute about the posi tion of the Black Stone, and who should have the honour of raising it to its place. 1 He decided for the corner chosen by Abraham, and distributed the privilege amongst the clans. The Benu Zahrah and Benu Abd Manaf took the front wall and the door; to the Benu Jama and the Benu Sahm was allotted the back wall; the Benu Makhzum and their Kuraysh relations stood at the southern wall; and at the ' Stone ' corner were posted the Benu Abd al-Dar, the Benu As'ad, and the Benu Ada. 9. Abdullah bin Zubayr, nephew of Ayishah, rebuilt the Ka'abah in a.h. 64. It had been weakened by fire, which burnt the covering, besides splitting the Black Stone into three pieces, and by the Manjanik (catapults) of Hosayn ) bin Numayr, general of Yazid, who obstinately besieged Meccah till he heard of his sovereign's death. Abdullah, hoping to fulfil a prophecy, 2 and seeing that the people of Meccah fled in alarm, pulled down the building by means of ' thin-calved Abyssinian slaves.' When they came to Abraham's foundation he saw that it included Al-Hijr, which part the Kuraysh had been unable to build. The building was made of cut stone and fine lime brought from Al-Yaman. Abdullah, taking in the Hatim, lengthened the building by seven cubits, and added to its former height nine cubits, 1 Others derive the surname from this decision. 2 As will afterwards be mentioned, almost every Meccan knows the prophecy of Mohammed, that the birthplace of his faith will be destroyed by an army from Abyssinia. Such things bring their own fulfilment.■HBttMMMBMBi 324 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. thus making a total of twenty-seven. He roofed over; the whole, or a part; re-opened the western door, to : serve as an exit; and, following the advice of his aunt, who quoted the Prophet's words, he supported the in terior with a single row of three columns, instead of the double row of six placed there by the Kuraysh. Finally, he paved the Mataf, or circuit, ten cubits round with the remaining slabs, and increased the Harim by taking in the nearer houses. During the building, a curtain was stretched round the walls, and pilgrims compassed them j externally. When finished, it was perfumed inside and out- | side, and invested with brocade. Then Abdullah and all the citizens went forth in a procession to the Tanim, a reverend place near Meccah, returned to perform Umrah, the Lesser Pilgrimage, slew 100 victims, and rejoiced with great festivities. The Caliph Abd al-Malik bin Marwan besieged Abdullah bin Zubayr, who, after a brave defence, was slain. In a.h. 74, Hajjaj bin Yusuf, general of Abd al- • Malik's troops, wrote to the prince, informing him that 1 Abdullah had made unauthorised additions to and changes j in the Harim : the reply brought an order to rebuild the house. Hajjaj again excluded the Hatim and retired the northern wall six cubits and a span, making it twenty- five cubits long by twenty-four broad ; the other three sides were allowed to remain as built by the son of Zubayr.

Again, supposing the Meccan temple to be originally dedicated to the sun, why should the pure Arab word ' Ba'al ' become the Hebraeized Hobal, and the deity be only one in the three hundred and sixty that formed the Pantheon ? 1 This is an audacious falsehood; the Ka'abah is scarcely ever opened without some accident happening.The r of :over swah ;very spec- there ty in i the four ople.' ter'? turns ghter.

The first of the pilgrims to Meccah and Al-Madinah who has left an authentic account of the Holy Cities is 'Lewes Wertomannus (Lodovico Bartema), gentelman of the citie of Rome. 1 ' ' If any man,' says this aucthor, ' shall demand of me the cause of this my voyage, cer- teynely I can shewe no better reason than is the ardent desire of knowledge, which hath moved many other to see the world and the miracles of God therein.' In the year of our Lord 1503 he departed from Venice 'with prosperous wynds,' arrived at Alexandria and visited Babylon of Egypt, Berynto, Tripoli, Antioch, and Damascus. He started from the latter place on the 8th of April, 1503, 'in familiaritie and friendshyppe with a certayne Captayne Mameluke ' (which term he applies to 'al such Christians as have forsaken theyr fayth, to serve the Mahumetans and Turks'), and in the garb of a 1 I have consulted the ' Navigation and Voyages of Lewes Wertomannus to the Regions of Arabia, Egypt, Persia, Syria, Ethiopia, and East India, both within and without the River of Ganges, &amp;c., conteyning many notable and straunge things both Historicall and Natural.

The Hijazi Badawi of this day is a much more danger ous enemy; the matchlock and musket have made him so ; and the only means of crippling him is to prevent the importation of firearms and lead, and by slow degrees to disarm the population. After performing the ceremonies of pilgrimage at Al-Madinah and Meccah, he escaped to Zida or Gida (Jeddah), 'despite the trumpetter of the aep: caravana giving warning to all the Mamalukes to make e readie their horses, to direct their journey toward Syria, __ej with proclamation of death to all that should refuse so to ] 5 — — ; — 'T One 1 The number of pilgrims in this Caravan is still grossly ev ^ aggerated.

He touched at certain ports of Al-Yaman, and got into trouble at Aden, ' where the Mahumetans took him,' and ' put shackles on his legges, which came by occasion of a cer- tayne idolatour, who cryed after him, saying, O, Christian Dogge, borne of Dogges. 1 ' The lieutenant of the Sultan 'assembled his council,' consulted them about putting the traveller to death as a ' spye of Portugales,' and threw him ironed into a dungeon. On being carried shackled into the presence of the Sultan, Bartema said that he was a Roman, professed a Mamaluke in Babylon of Alcayr ;' but when told to utter the formula of the Moslem faith, he held his tongue, ' eyther that it pleased not God, or that for feare and scruple of conscience he durst not.' For which offence he was again ' deprived of ye fruition of heaven.' But, happily for Bartema, in those days the women of Arabia were ' greatly in love with whyte men.' Before escaping from Meccah, he lay hid in the house of a Mohammedan, and could not express his gratitude for the good wife's care; ' also,' he says, ' this furthered my good enterteynement, that there was in the house a fayre young mayde, the niese of the Mahumetan, who was greatly in loue with me.' At Aden he was equally fortunate. One of the Sultan's three wives, on the departure of her lord and master, bestowed her heart upon the traveller. She was 'very faire and comely, after theyr maner, and of colour inclynyng to blacke:' she i This venerable form of abuse still survives the lapse of time.

He seems to have played his part to some purpose, under the colour of madness, converting a «great fatt shepe' to Mohammedanism, killing an ass because he refused to be a proselyte, and, finally, he « handeled a Jewe so euyll that he had almost killed hym.' After sundry adventures and a trip to Sanaa, he started for Persia with the Indian fleet, in which, by means of fair promises, he had made friendship with 3 certain captain. He visited Zayla and Berberah in the Somali country, and at last reached Hormuz. The srd book 'entreateth of Persia,' the 4th of ' India, ^and of the cities and other notable thynges seene there.' The 8th book contains the ' voyage of India,' in which he includes Pegu, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, where, ' abhorryng the beastly maners ' of a cannibal popula tion, he made but a short stay. Returning to Calicut, he used ' great subtiltie,' escaped to the ' Portugales,' and was well received by the viceroy. After describing in his 7th book the ' viage or navigation of Ethiopia, Melinda, Mombaza, Mozambrich (Mozambique), and Zaphala (Sofala),' he passed the Cape called 'Caput Bonse Spei, and repaired to the goodly citie of Luxburne (Lisbon),' where he had the honour of kissing hands, The king confirmed with his great seal the 'letters patentes,' whereby his lieutenant the viceroy of India had given the pilgrim the order of knighthood. 'And thus,' says Bartema by way of conclusion, ' departing from thence with the kyngs pasporte and safe conducte, at the length after these my lon g and great trauayles and 1 For a full account of the mania fit I must refer the curious reader to the original (Book ii. chap, v.)

This old traveller's pages abound with the informa tion to be collected in a fresh field by an unscrupulous and hard-headed observer. They are of course disfigured with a little romancing. His Jews at Khaybor, near Al- Madinah, were five or six spans long. At Meccah he saw two unicorns, the younger ' at the age of one yeare, and lyke a young coolte; the horne of this is of the length of four handfuls. 1 ' And so credulous is he about anthropophagi, that he relates of Mahumet (son to the Sultan of Sanaa) how he ' by a certayne naturall tyrannye and madnesse delyteth to eate man's fleeshe, and there fore secretly kylleth many to eate them. 8 ' But all things well considered, Lodovico Bartema, for correctness of observation and readiness of wit, stands in the foremost rank of the old Oriental travellers. I proceed to quote, and to illustrate with notes, the few chapters devoted in the 1st volume of this little- known work to Meccah and Al-Madinah. Chapter XI.— Of a Mount ayne inhabited with J ewes, and of the Citie of Medinathalnabi, where Mahumet was buried.

They might, therefore, possibly have been African antelopes, which a lusus natura had deprived of their second horn. But the suspicion of fable remains. 2 This is a tale not unfamiliar to the Western World. Louis XI. of France was supposed to drink the blood of babes,— 'pour rajeunir sa veini epuisee.'

It is therefore to bee vnderstoode, that none other shynyng came out of the sepulchre, then a certayne flame which the priests caused to come out of the open place of the towre 1 spoken of here before, whereby they would have deceyved vs. And therefore our captayne commaunded that thereafter none of vs should enter into the temple. Of this also we haue most true experience, and most certaynely assure you that there is neyther iron or Steele or the magnes stone that should so make the toombe of Mahumet to hange in the ayre, as some haue falsely imagined ; neyther is there any mountayne nearer than foure myles : we remayned here three dayes to refreshe our company.

Chapter XIV.— The Journey to Mecha* After we were satisfied, or rather wearyed, with the filthinesse and lothesomenesse of the trumperyes, deceites, trifles, and hypocrisis of the religion of Mahumet, we determined to goe forward on our journey; and that by guyding of a pylot who might directe our course with the mariners boxe or compasse, with also the carde of the sea, euen as is vsed in sayling on the sea. And thus bendyng our journey to the west we founde a very fayre 1 It is unnecessary to suppose any deception of the kind.

In this sea of sande we traueiled the journey of in three days and nightes: this is a great brode plaine, all int couered with white sande, in maner as small as floure.

When the wynde bloweth from the northeast, then the sand riseth and is driuen against a certayne moun- tayne, which is an arme of the mount Sinai. 1 There we found certayne pyllers artificially wrought, whiche they call lanuan. On the lefte hande of the sayde mountayne, in the toppe or rydge thereof, is a denne, and the entrie into it is by an iron gate. Some fayne that in that place Mahumet lyued in contemplation. Here we heard a certayne horrible noyse and crye; for passyng the sayde mountayne, we were in so great daunger, that we thought neuer to have escaped. Departyng, therefore, from the fountayne, we continued our journey for the space of ten dayes, and twyse in the way fought with fyftie thousande Arabians, and so at the length came to the citie of Mecha, where al things were troubled by reason of the warres betweene two brethren, contendyng whiche of them shoulde possesse the kyngedome of Mecha. Chapter XV.— Of the Fouvme and, Situation of the Citie of Mecha; and why the Mohumetans resort thyther. Nowe the tyme requireth to speake somewhat of the famous citie of Mecha, or Mecca, what it is, howe it is situate, and by whom it is gouerned. The citie is very fayre and well inhabited, and conteyneth in rounde fourme syxe thousande houses, as well buylded as ours, and some that cost three or foure thousande peeces of golde: it hath no walles. About two furlongs from the citie is a mount, where the way is cutte out, 3 whiche leadeth to a playne 1 This is probably Jabal Warkan, on the Darb al-Sultani, or Sea road to Meccah.

It is on euery syde fortified with mountains,!: the stead of walles or bulwarkes, and hath foure entries The Gouernour is a Soltan, and one of the foure brethen of the progenie of Mahumet, and is subject to the Soltar of Babylon of whom we haue spoken before. His othe: three brethren be at continuall warre with hym. The eighteen daye of Maye we entered into the citie by the north syde; then, by a declynyng way, we came into a playne. On the south syde are two mountaynes, the on; very neere the other, distant onely by a little valley, which is the way that leadeth to the gate of Mecha. Or the east syde is an open place betweene two mountaynes lyke vnto a valley, 1 and is the waye to the mountayne where they sacrifice to the Patriarkes Abraham anc Isaac. 2 This mountayne is from the citie about ten 01 twelve myles, and of the heyght of three stones cast it is of stone as harde as marble, yet no marble. 8 In tht toppe of the mountaine is a temple or Meschita, madf after their fashion, and hath three wayes to enter into it. 1 At the foote of the mountayne are two cesterns, whidi conserue waters without corruption: of these, the one ii reserued to minister water to the camels of the carauam of Babylon or Alcayr; and the other, for them of Da masco. It is rayne water, and is deriued far of. 6 But to returne to speake of the citie ; for as touchync the maner of sacrifice which they vse at the foote of the mountayne wee wyll speake hereafter. Entryng, there fore, into the citie, wee founde there the carauana 0: Memphis, or Babylon, which prevented vs eyght dayes, and came not the waye that wee came. This carauana 1 This is the open ground leading to the Muna Pass. 2 An error. The sacrifice is performed at Muna, not on Arafc, the mountain here alluded to. 3 The material is a close grey granite. 4 The form of the building has now been changed. 5 The Meccans have a tradition concerning it, that it is den\e- from Baghdad.Appendix IV.—Lndovicns Vcrtomannus. 347 conteyned threescore and foure thousande camelles, and a hundred Mamalukes to guyde them. And here ought you to consyder that, by the opinion of all men, this citie is greatly cursed of God, as appereth by the great barren- nesse thereof, for it is destitute of all maner of fruites and corne. 1 It is scorched with drynesse for lacke of water, and therefore the water is there growen to suche pryce, that you cannot for twelue pence buye as much water as wyll satysfie your thyrst for one day. Nowe, therefore, I wyll declare what prouision they have for victuales. The most part is brought them from the citie of Babylon, otherwyse named Memphis, Cayrus, or Alcayr, a citie of the ryuer of Nilus in Egypt as we have sayde before, and is brought by the Red Sea (called Mare Erythreum) from a certayne port named Gida, distaunt from Mecha fourtie myles. 2 The rest of theyr prouisions is brought from Arabia Faelix, (that is) the happye or blessed Arabia : so named for the fruitfulnesse thereof, in respect of the other two Arabiaes, called Petrea and Diserta, that is, stonye and desart. They haue also muche corne from Ethyopia. Here we found a marueylous number of straungers and peregrynes, or pylgryms ; of the whiche some came from Syria, some from Persia, and other from both the East Indiaes, (that is to say) both India within the ryuer of Ganges, and also the other India without the same ryuer. I neuer sawe in anye place greater abundaunce and fre- quentation of people, forasmuche as I could perceyue by tarrying there the space of 20 dayes. These people resort thyther for diuers causes, as some for merchandies, some to obserue theyr vowe of pylgrymage, and other to haue pardon for theyr sinnes : as touchyng the whiche we wyll speake more hereafter. 1 Moslems who are disposed to be facetious on serious subjects, often remark that it is a mystery why Allah should have built his house in a spot so barren and desolate. 2 This is still correct. Suez supplies Jeddah with corn and other provisions.348 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Chapter XVII.— Of the Pardons or Indulgences ofMecha, Let vs now returne to speake of the pardons of pil- gryms, for the which so many strange nations resort thither. In the myddest of the citie is a temple, in fashyon lyke vnto the colossus of Rome, the amphitheatrum, I meane, lyke vnto a stage, yet not of marbled or hewed stones, but of burnt bryckes ; for this temple, like vnto an amphitheatre, hath fourscore and ten, or an hundred gates, 1 and is vaulted. The entrance is by a discent of twelve stayers or degrees on euery part 2 : in the church porche, are sold only jewels and precious stones. In the entry the gylted walles shyne on euery syde with incomparable splendour. In the lower part of the temple (that is vnder the vaulted places) is seene a maruelous multitude of men; for there are fyue or sixe thousande men that sell none other thyng then sweete oyntmentes, and especially a cer- tayne odoriferous and most sweete pouder wherewith dead bodyes are embalmed. 8 And hence, all maner of sweete sauours are carried in maner into the countreys of all the Mahumetans. It passeth all beleefe to thynke of the exceedyng sweetnesse of these sauours, farre surmounting the shoppes of the apothecaries. The 23 daye of Maye the pardones began to be graunted in the temple, and in what maner we wyll nowe declare. The temple in the myddest is Open without any inclosyng, and in the myddest also thereof is a turrett of the largnesse of sixe passes in cercuitie, 4 and inuolued or hanged with cloth or 1 A prodigious exaggeration. Burckhardt enumerates twenty The principal gates are seventeen in number. In the old buildir? they were more numerous. Jos.

They enter into the turret by a gate of syluer, and is on euery syde besette with vesselles full of balme. On the day of Pentecost licence is graunted to al men to se these thynges. The inhabitantes affyrm that balme orbalsame to be part of the treasure of the Soltan that is Lorde of Mecha. At euery vaulte of the turret is fastened a rounde circle of iron, lyke to the ryng of a doore. 2 The 22 day of Maye, a great multitude of people beganne, early in the mornyng before day, seuen tymes to walke about the turret, kyssing euery corner thereof, often tymes feelyng and handelyng them. From this turret about tenne or twelue pases is an other turret, like a chappell buylded after our maner. This hath three or foure entryes in the myddest thereof is a well of threescore and tenne cubites deepe ; the water of this well is infected with salt peter or saltniter. 3 Egypt men are therevnto appoynted to drawe water for all the people : and when a multitude of people haue seuen tymes gone rounde about the first turret, they come to this well, and touchyng the mouth or brym thereof, they saye thus,' Be it in the honour of God; God pardon me, and forgeue me my synnes.' When these woordes are sayde, they that drawe the water powre three buckettes of water on the headdes of euery one of them, and stand neere about the well, and washe them all wette from the headde to the foote, although they be apparelled with sylk. Then the dotyng fooles dreame that they are cleane from all theyr synnes, and that theyr synnes are forgeuen them. They saye, furthermore, that vol. i. p. 248.)

Therefore, when they intend to sacrifice, some of them kyll three sheepe, some foure, and tenne ; so that the butcherie sometyme so floweth with blood that in one sacrifice are slayne above three thousande sheepe. 1 hey are slayne at the rysyng of the sunne, and shortly after are distributed to the poore for God's sake: for I sawe there a great and confounded multitude of poor people as to the number of 20 thousande.

I beleue that these poore people came thither rather for hunger than for deuotion, which I thinke by this coniectur,—that great abundance of cucumbers are brought thyther from Arabia F aelix, whiche they eate, castyng away the parynges without their houses or tabernacles, where a multitude of the sayde poore people geather them euen out ofthemyre and sande, and eate them, and are so greedie of these parynges that they fyght who may geather most. 2 The 1 There is great confusion in this part of Bartema's narrative.

The summe of the sermon was, that ihara ^vith teares they should bewayle theyr sinnes, and beate their brestes with sighes and lamentation. And the preacher hymselfe with loude voyce spake these wordes, ' 0 Abraham beloued of God, O Isaac chosen of God, and his friend, praye to God for the people of Nabi.' When these woordes were sayde, sodenly were heard lamenting voyces. When the sermon was done, a rumor was spredde that a great armye of Arabians, to the num ber of twentie thousande, were commyng. With which newes, they that kept the caraunas beyng greatly feared, with all speede, lyke madde men, fledde into the citie of Mecha, and we agayne bearyng newes of the Arabians approche, fledde also into the citie. But whyle wee were in the mydwaye between the mountayne and Mecha, we came by a despicable wall, of the breadthe of foure cubites ; the people passyng this wall, had couered the waye with stones, the cause whereof, they saye to be this : when Abraham was commaunded to sacrifice his sonne, he wylled his sonne Isaac to folowe hym to the place where he should execute the commaundement of God. As Isaac went to follow his father, there appeared to him in the way a Deuyl, in lykenesse of a fayre and freendly person, not farre from the sayde wall, and asked hym freendlye whyther h e went. Isaac answered that he went to his and other Africans, but it attributes to them an unworthy motive. once asked a learned Arab what induced the wretches to rush upon destruction, as they do, when the Faith renders pilgrimage obligatory only upon those who can afford necessaries for the way. ' By Allah,' ne replied, 'there is fire within their hearts, which can be quenched only at God's House, and at His Prophet's Tomb.' i Bartema alludes to the 'Day of Arafat,' gth of Zu'l Hijjah, ^nich precedes, not follows, the ' Day of Sacrifice.' id. s are here- theyr id to , and with ;ande , and ake: poor nake ifyre at is ;hese i for ^reat -abia nges de of myre :hese The ative. in the then they i the ruri,'2^2 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Miccah. father who tarryed for him. To this the enemie of man- kynde answered, that it was best for hym to tarrye, and yf that he went anye further, his father would sacrifice him. But Isaac nothyng feareyng this aduertisement of the Deuyl, went forward, that his father on hym myght execute the commaundement of God : and with this answere (as they saye) they Deuyell departed. Yet as Isaac went forwarde, the Diuell appeared to hym agayne in the lykenesse of an other frendlye person, and forbade hym as before. Then Isaac taking vp a stone in that place, hurlde it at the Deuyl and wounded him in the fore head : In witnesse and remembraunce whereof, the people passyng that waye when they come neare the wall, are accustomed to cast stones agaynst it, and from thence go into the citie. 1 As we went this way, the ayre was in maner darkened with a multitude of stock doues. They saye that these doues, are of the progenie of the doue that spake in the eare of Mahumet, in lykenesse of the Holye Ghost. 2 These are seene euery where, as in the villages, houses, tauernes and graniers of come and ryse, and are so tame that one can scharsely dryue them away.

Chapter XX.— Of diners thynges which chaunced io me in Mecha; and of Zida, a port of Mecha. It may seeme good here to make mention of certayne thynges, in the which is seene sharpenesse of witte in case of vrgent necessitie, which hath no lawe as sayeth the prouerbe, for I was dryuen to the point howe I myght prieuly escape from Mecha. Therefore whereas my Cap- tayne gaue me charge to buy certayne thynges, as I was in the market place, a certayne Mamaluke knewe me to be a christian, and therefore in his owne language spake vnto me these woordes, ' Inte mename,' that is, whence art thou P 1 To whom I answered that I was a Mahumetan. But he sayde. Thou sayest not truely. I sayde agayne, by the head of Mahumet I am a Ma humetan. Then he sayde agayne. Come home to my house, I folowed hym willingly. When we were there, he began to speake to me in the Italian tongue, and asked me agayne from whence I was, affyrming that he knewe me, and that I was no Mahumetan : also that he had been sometyme in Genua and Venice. And that his woordes myght be better beleeued, he rehearsed many thinges which testified that he sayed trueth. When I vnder- stoode this, I confessed freely, that I was a Romane, but professed to the fayth of Mahumet in the citie of Babylon, and there made one of the Mamalukes; whereof he seemed greatly to reioyce and therefore vsed me honourably. But because my desyre was yet to goe further, I asked the Mahumetan whether that citie of Mecha was so famous as all the world spake of it: and inquired of him where was the great aboundaunce of pearles, precious stones, spices, and other rich merchandies that the bruite went of to be in that citie. And all my talke was to the ende 1 In the vulgar dialect, ' Ant min ayn?' vol. 11. 23354 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinak and Meccah. to grope the mynde of the Mahumetan, that I migb! know the cause why such thinges were not brought thyther as in tyme paste. But to auoyde all suspition, I durst here make no mention of the dominion which the Kyng of Portugale had in the most parte of that ocean, and of the gulfes of the Redde Sea and Persia. Then he began with more attentyue mynde, in order to declare vnto me the cause why that marte was not so greatly frequented as it had been before, and layde the only faulte thereof in the Kyng of Portugale. But when he had made men tion of the kyng, I began of purpose to detracte his fame, lest the Mahumetan might thinke that I reioyced that the Christians came thyther for merchandies. When he perceyued that I was of profession an enemy to the Chris tians, he had me yet in greater estimation, and proceeded to tell me many thynges more. When I was well in structed in all thynges, I spake vnto him friendly these woordes in the Mahumet's language Menaba Menalhabi, that is to say, ' I pray you assist mee. 1 ' He asked mee wherein. ' To help me (sayed I) howe I may secretly departe hence.'

Our second pilgrim was Jos. Pitts, of Exon, 1 a youth fifteen or sixteen years old, when in a.d. 1678, his genius ' leading him to be a sailor and to see foreign countries,' caused him to be captured by an Algerine pirate. After living in slavery for some years, he was taken by his ' patroon ' to Meccah and Al-Madinah via Alexandria, Rosetta, Cairo, and Suez. His description of these places is accurate in the main points, and though tainted with prejudice and bigotry, he is free from superstition and credulity. Conversant with Turkish and Arabic, he has acquired more knowledge of the tenets and practice of Al-Islam than his predecessor, and the term of his residence at Algier, fifteen years, sufficed, despite the defects of his education, to give fulness and finish to his observations. His chief patr oon, captain of a troop of 1 It is curious, as Crichton (Arabia, vol. ii. p. 208) observes, that Gibbon seems not to have seen or known anything of the little work published by Pitts on his return home. It is entitled 'A faithful Account of the Religion and the Manners of the Mahometans, in which is a particular Relation of their Pilgrimage to Mecca, the Place of Mahomet's Birth, and Description of Medina, and of his Tomb there,' &amp;C., &amp;c. My copy is the 4th edition, printed for T. Longman and R. Hett, London, a.d. 1708.

He began by large offers and failed ; he succeeded by dint of a great cudgel repeatedly applied to Joseph Pitts' bare feet. ' I roared out,' says the relator, ' to feel the pain of his cruel strokes, but the more I cried, the more furiously he laid on, and to stop the noise of my crying, would stamp with his feet on my mouth.' ' At last,' through terror, he ' turned and spake the words (la ilaha, &amp;c.), as usual holding up the forefinger of the right hand '; he was then circumcised in due form. Of course, such conversion was not a sincere one—' there was yet swines-flesh in his teeth.' He boasts of saying his prayers in a state of impurity, hates his fellow religionists, was truly pleased to hear Mahomet called sabbatero, i.e., shoemaker, reads his bible, talks of the horrid evil of apostacy, calls the Prophet a ' bloody imposter,' eats heartily in private of hog, and is very much concerned for one of his country men who went home to his own country, but came again to Algier, and voluntarily, without the least force used towards him, became a Mahometan. His first letter from his father reached him some days after he had been compelled by his patroon's barbarity to abjure his faith. One sentence appears particularly to have afflicted him : it was this, ' to have a care and keep close to God, and to be sure never, by any methods of cruelty that could be used towards me, be prevailed to deny my blessed Saviour, and that he (the father) would rather hear of my death than of my being a Mahometan.' Indeed, through out the work, it appears that his repentance was sincere. ' God be merciful to me a Sinner I' is the deprecation that precedes the account of his ' turn ing Turk,' and the book concludes with, 'To him, therefore, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Three360 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Persons and one God, be all Honour, Glory, and Praise world without end. Amen' Having received from his patroon, whom he acknow ledges to have been a second parent to him, a letter of free dom at Meccah and having entered into pay, still living with his master, Pitts began to think of escape. The Grand Turk had sent to Algier for ships, and the renegade was allowed to embark on board one of them provided with a diplomatic letter 1 from Mr. Baker, Consul of Algier, to Mr. Raye, Consul at Smyrna. The devil, we are told, was very busy with him in the Levant, tempting him to lay aside all thoughts of escaping, to return to Algier, and to continue a Mussulman, and the loss of eight months' pay and certain other monies seems to have weighed heavily upon his soul. Still he prepared for the desperate enterprise, in which failure would have exposed him to be dragged about the streets on the stones till half dead, and then be burned to ashes in the Jews' burial-place. A generous friend, Mr. Eliot, a Cornish merchant who had served some part of his apprenticeship in Exon and had settled at Smyrna, paid £/[ for his passage in a French ship to Leghorn. Therefrom, in the evening before sailing, he went on board ' apparel'd as an Englishman with his beard shaven, a campaign periwig, and a cane in his hand, accompanied with three or four of his friends. At Leghorn he prostrated himself, and kissed the earth, blessing Almighty God, for his mercy and goodness to him, that he once more set footing on the 1 Some years afterwards, Mr. Consul Baker, when waited upon by Pitts, in London, gave him a copy of the letter, with the following memorandum upon the back of it—'Copy of my letter to Consul Raye at Smyrna, to favour the escape of Joseph Pitts, an Eng lish renegade, from a squadron of Algier men-of-war. Had my kind ness to him been discovered by the government of Algiers, my legs and arms had first been broken, and my carcass burnt—a danger hitherto not courted by any.'Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 361 European Christian 1 part of the world.' He travelled through Italy, Germany, and Holland, where he received many and great kindnesses. But his patriotism was damped as he entered ' England, his own native country, and the civilised land must have made him for a time regret having left Algier. The very first night he lay ashore, he was ' imprest into the kings service' (we having at that time war with France); despite argu ments and tears he spent some days in Colchester jail, and finally he was put on board a smack to be carried to the Dreadnought man-of-war. But happily for himself he had written to Sir William Falkener, one of the Smyrna or Turkey company in London ; that gentleman used his interest to procure a protection from the Ad miralty office, upon the receipt of which good news, Joseph Pitts did ' rejoice exceedingly and could not for bear leaping upon the deck.' He went to London, thanked Sir William, and hurried down to Exeter, where he ends his fifteen years' tale with a homely, heartful and affecting description of his first meeting with his father. His mother died about a year before his return. 7 he following passages are parts of the 7th and 8th chapters of Pitts' little-known work. 'Next we came to Gidda, the nearest sea-port town to Mecca, not quite one day's journey from it, 2 where the ships are unloaded. Here we are met by Dilleels, 8 certain persons who came from Mecca on purpose to instruct the Hagges, or pilgrims, in the ceremonies (most 1 The italics in the text are the author's. This is admirably char acteristic of the man. Asiatic Christendom would not satisfy him. He seems to hate the ' damnable doctrines' of the ' Papists,' almost as much as those of the Moslems. 2 He must have been accustomed to long days' journeys. Al- Idrisi makes Jeddau forty miles from Meccah; I calculated about forty-four. 3 Dalil, a guide, generally called at Meccah ' Muttawwif.'362 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. of them being ignorant of them) which are to be used in their worship at the temple there; in the middle of which is a place which they call Beat Allah, i.e. the House of God. They say that Abraham built it; to which I give no credit. 'As soon as we come to the town of Mecca, the Dilleel, or guide, carries us into the great street, which is in the midst of the town, and to which the temple joins. 1 After the camels are laid down, he first directs us to the Fountains, there to take Abdes 2 ; which being done, he brings us to the temple, into which (having left our shoes with one who constantly attends to receive them) we enter at the door called Bab-al-salem, i.e. the Welcome Gate, or Gate of Peace. After a few paces entrance, the Dilleel makes a stand, and holds up his hands towards the Beat-Allah (it being in the middle of the Mosque), the Hagges imitating him, and saying after him the same words which he speaks. At the very first sight of the Beat-Allah, the Hagges melt into tears, then we are led up to it, still speaking after the Dilleel; then we are led round it seven times, and then make two Erkaets. 8 This being done, we are led into the street again, where we are sometimes to run and sometimes to walk very quick with the Dilleel from one place of the street to the other, about a bowshot. 4 And I profess I could not chuse but admire to see those poor creatures so extraordinary de vout, and affectionate, when they were about these superstitions, and with what awe and trembling they 1 Pitts' Note,—that before they'll provide for themselves, they serve God in their way. 2 Abdast is the Turkish word, borrowed from the Persian, for ' Wuzu,' the minor ablution. 3 Ruka'at, a bending.

After all this is done, we returned to the place in the street where we left our camels, with our provisions, and necessaries, and then look out for lodgings; where when we come, we disrobe and take of our Hir- rawems, 1 and put on our ordinary clothes again. 'All the pilgrims hold it to be their great duty well to improve their time whilst they are at Mecca, not to do their accustomed duty and devotion in the temple, but to spend all their leisure time there, and as far as strength will permit to continue at Towoaf, i.e. to walk round the Beat-Allah, which is about four and twenty paces square. At one corner of the Beat, there is a black stone fastened and framed in with silver plate, 2 and every time they come to that corner, they kiss the stone; and having gone round seven times they perform two Erkaets-nomas, or prayers. This stone, they say, was formerly white, and then it was called Haggar Essaed, i.e. the White Stone. 8 But by reason of the sins of the multitudes of people who kiss it, it is become black, and is now called Haggar Esswaed, or the Black Stone. 'This place is so much frequented by people going round it, that the place of the Towoaf, i.e. the circuit which they take in going round it, is seldom void of people at any time of the day or night. 4 Many have waited several weeks, nay months, for the opportunity of finding it so. For they say, that if any person is blessed with such an opportunity, that for his or her zeal in keeping up the honour of Towoaf, let they petition what they will at the Beat-Allah, they shall be answered. Many will walk round 1 Ihram, the pilgrim-garb. 2 Now gold or gilt. 3 This is an error. The stone is called Hajar Aswad, the Black Stone, or Hajar As'ad, the Blessed Stone. Moreover, it did not change its colour on account of the sins of the people who kissed it. 4 The Meccans, in effect, still make this a boast.364 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah'and Meccah. till they are quite weary, then rest, and at it again; care fully remembering at the end of every seventh time to per form two Erkaets. This Beat is in effect the object of their devotion, the idol which they adore : for, let them be never so far distant from it. East, West, North, or South of it, they will be sure to bow down towards it; but when they are at the Beat, they may go on which side they please and pay their Sallah towards it. 1 Sometimes there are several hundreds at Towoaf at once, especially after Acshamnomas, or fourth time of service, which is after candle-lighting (as you heard before), and these both men and women, but the women walk on the outside the men, and the men nearest to the Beat. In so great a resort as this, it is not to be supposed that every individual person can come to kiss the stone afore-mentioned; therefore, in such a case, the lifting up the hands towards it, smoothing down their faces, and using a short expression of devotion, as Allah-waick barick, i.e. Blessed God, or Allah cabor, i .e. Great God, some such like; and so passing by it till opportunity of kissing it offers, is thought sufficient. 2 But when there are but few men at Towoaf, then the women get opportunity to kiss the said stone, and when they have gotten it, they close in with it as they come round, and walk round as quick as they can to come to it again, and keep possession of it for a considerable time. The men, when they see that the women have got the place, will be so civil as to pass by and give them leave to take their fill, as I may say in their Towoaf or walking round, during which they are using some formal expressions. When the women are at the , stone, then it is esteemed a very rude and abominable thing to go near them, respecting the time and place. 1 Nothing more blindly prejudiced than this statement. Moslems 1 turn towards Meccah, as Christians towards Jerusalem. 2 As will afterwards be explained, all the four orthodox schools do not think it necessary to kiss the stone after each circumambula- tion.Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 365 ' I shall now give you a more particular description of Mecca and the temple there. ' First, as to Mecca. It is a town situated in a barren place (about one day's journey from the Red Sea) in a valley, or rather in the midst of many little hills. It is a place of no force, wanting both walls and gates. Its buildings are (as I said before) very ordinary, insomuch that it would be a place of no tolerable entertainment, were it not for the anniversary resort of so many thousand Hagges, or pilgrims, on whose coming the whole depen- dance of the town (in a manner) is; for many shops are scarcely open all the year besides. ' The people here, I observed, are a poor sort of people, very thin, lean, and swarthy. The town is sur rounded for several miles with many thousands of little hills, which are very near one to the other. I have been on the top of some of them near Mecca, where I could see some miles about, yet was not able to see the farthest of the hills. They are all stony-rock and blackish, and pretty near of a bigness, appearing at a distance like cocks of hay, but all pointing towards Mecca. Some of them are half a mile in circumference, but all near of one height. The people here have an odd and foolish sort of tradition concerning them, viz.; That when Abraham went about building the Beat-Allah, God by his wonderful providence did so order it, that every mountain in the world should contribute something to the building thereof; and accordingly every one did send its proportion; though there is a mountain near Algier, which is called Corradog, i.e. Black Mountain; and the reason of its blackness, they say, is because it did not send any part of itself towards building the temple at Mecca. 1 Between 1 These are mere local traditions. The original Ka'abah was composed of materials gathered from the six mountains of Paradise (chap, xx.) The present building is of grey granite quarried in a hill near Meccah.566 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. these hills is good and plain travelling, though they stand one to another. ' There is upon the top of one of them a cave, which they term Hira, 1 i. e. Blessing ; into which (they say) Ma homet did usually retire for his solitary devotions, medita tions, and fastings; and here they believe he had a great part of the Alcoran brought him by the Angel Gabriel. I have been in this cave, and observed that it is not at all beautified ; at which I admired. ' About half a mile out of Mecca is a very steep hill, and there are stairs made to go to the top of it, where is a cupola, under which is a cloven rock; into this, they say, Mahomet, when very young, viz. about four years of age, was carried by the Angel Gabriel, who opened his breast, and took out his heart, from which he picked some black blood-specks, which was his original corruption; then put it into its place again, and afterwards closed up the part; and that during this operation Mahomet felt no pain. ' Into this very place I myself went, because the rest of my company did so, and performed some Erkaets, as they did. ' The town hath plenty of water, and yet but few herbs, unless in some particular places. Here are several sorts of good fruits to be had, viz. grapes, melons, water melons, cucumbers, pumkins, and the like ; but these are brought two or three days'journey off, where there is a place of very great plenty, called, if I mistake not, Habbash.' 1 Now Jabal Nur. 2 They come from the well-known Taif, which the country people call Hijaz, but never Habbash. The word Taif literally means the 'circumambulator.' It is said that when Adam settled at Meccah, finding the country barren, he prayed to Allah to supply him with a bit of fertile land. Immediately appeared a mountain, which having performed Tawaf round the Ka'abah, settled itself down eastward of Meccah. Hence, to the present day, Taif is called Kita min al-Sham, a piece of Syria, its fatherland.Appendix V. — Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 367 Likewise sheep are brought hither and sold. So that as to Mecca itself, it affords little or nothing of comfortable provisions. It lieth in a very hot country, insomuch that people run from one side of the streets to the other to get into the shadow, as the motion of the sun causes it. The inhabitants, especially men, do usually sleep on the tops of the houses for the air, or in the streets before their doors. Some lay the small bedding they have on a thin mat on the ground ; others have a slight frame, made much like drink-stalls on which we place barrels, standing on four legs, corded with palm cordage, on which they put their bedding. Before they bring out their bedding, they sweep the streets and water them. As for my own part, I usually lay open, without any bed-covering, on the top of the house : only I took a linen cloth, dipt in water, and after I had wrung it, covered myself with it in the night; and when I awoke I should find it dry ; then I would wet it again : and thus I did two or three times in a night. ' Secondly. I shall next give you some account of the temple of Mecca. ' It hath about forty-two doors to enter into it, not so much, I think, for necessity, as figure ; for in some places they are close by one another. The form of it is much resembling that of the Royal Exchange in London, but I believe it is near ten times bigger. It is all open and gravelled in the midst, except some paths that come from certain doors which lead to the Beat-Allah, and are paved with broad stones. The walks, or cloisters, all round are arched over-head, and paved beneath with fine broad stone ; and all round are little rooms or cells, where such dwell and give themselves up to reading, studying, and a devout life, who are much akin to their dervises, or hermits. 'The Beat-Allah, which stands in the middle of the temple, is four-square, about twenty-four paces each368 Pilgrimage to A l-Madinah mid Meccah. square, and near twenty-four foot 1 in height. It is built with great stone, all smooth, and plain, without the least bit of carved work on it. It is covered all over from top to bottom with a thick sort of silk. Above the middle part of the covering are embroidered all round letters of gold, the meaning of which I cannot well call to mind, but I think they were some devout expressions. Each letter is near two foot in length and two inches broad. Near the lower end of this Beat are large brass rings fastened into it, through which passeth a great cotton rope; and to this the lower end of the covering is tacked. The threshold of the door that belongs to the Beat is as high as a man can reach ; and therefore when any person enter into it, a sort of ladder-stairs are brought for that purpose. The door is plated all over with silver 2 and there is a covering hangs over it and reaches to the ground, which is kept turned up all the week, except Thursday night, and Friday, which is their Sabbath. The said covering of the door is very thick imbroidered with gold, insomuch that it weighs several score pounds. The top of the Beat is flat, beaten with lime and sand; and there is a long gutter, or spout, to carry off the water when it rains; at which time the people will run, throng, and struggle, to get under the said gutter, that so the water that comes off the Beat may fall upon them, accounting it as the dew of Pleaven, and looking on it as a great happiness to have it drop upon them. But if they can recover some of this water to drink, they esteem it to be yet a much greater happiness. 1 This is an error of printing for 'paces.' 2 (Pitts' Note.) Not of massy gold, as a late French author (who, I am sure, was never there) says. The door is of wood, only plated over with silver; much less is the inside of the Beat ceiled with massy gold, as the same Frenchman asserts. I can assure the world it is no such thing. The door is of wood, thickly plated over with silver, in many parts gilt. And whatever hereabouts is gilt, the Meccans always call gold. (R. F. B.)Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 369 Many poor people make it their endeavour to get some of it, and present it to the Hagges, for which they are well rewarded. My Patroon had a present made him of this water, with which he was not a little pleased, and gave him that brought it a good reward. ' This Beat-Allah is opened but two days in the space of six weeks, viz. one day for the men, and the next day for the women. 1 As I was at Mecca about four months, I had the opportunity of entering into it twice ; a reputed advantage, which many thousands of the Hagges have not met with, for those that come by land make no longer stay at Mecca than sixteen or seventeen days. ' When any enter into the Beat, all that they have to do is to perform two Erkaets on each side, 2 with the holding up their two hands, and petitioning at the con clusion of each two Erkaets. And they are so very reverent and devout in doing this, that they will not suffer their eyes to wander and gaze about; for they account it very sinful so to do. Nay, they say that one was smitten blind for gazing about when in the Beat, as the reward of his vain and unlawful curiosity. 8 I could not, for my part, give any credit to this story, but looked on it as a legendary relation, and, therefore, was resolved, if I could, to take my view of it; I mean not to continue gazing about it, but now and then to cast an observing eye. And I profess I found nothing worth seeing in it, only two wooden pillars in the midst, to keep up the roof, 4 and a bar of iron fastened to them, on which hanged ^ ree or four silver lamps, which are, I suppose, but sel- 1 1 his is no longer the case. Few women ever enter the Ka'abah, on account of the personal danger they run there. 2 More correctly, at three of the corners, and the fourth oppo site the southern third of the western wall. 3 It is deemed disrespectful to look at the ceiling, but pilgrims turn their eyes in any other direction they please. 4 There are now three.

In one corner of the Beat is an iron or brass chain, I cannot tell which (for I made no use of it): the pilgrims just clap it about their necks in token of repentance. The floor of the Beat is marble, and so is the inside of the walls, on which there is written some thing in Arabick, which I had no time to read. The walls, though of marble on the inside, are hung over with silk, which is pulled off 1 before the Hagges enter. Those that go into the Beat tarry there but a very little while, viz. scarce so much as half a quarter of an hour, because others wait for the same privilege; and while some go in, others are going out. After all is over, and all that will have done this, the Sultan of Mecca, who is Shirreef, ». e. one of the race of Mahomet, accounts himself not too good to cleanse the Beat; and, therefore, with some of his favourites, doth wash and cleanse it. And first of all, they wash it with the holy water, Zem Zem, and after that with sweet water. The stairs which were brought to enter in at the door of the Beat being removed, the people crowd under the door to receive on them the sweep ings of the said water. And the besoms wherewith the Beat is cleansed are broken in pieces, and thrown out amongst the mob ; and he that gets a small stick or twig of it, keeps it as a sacred relique. ' But to speak something further of the temple of Mecca (for I am willing to be very particular in matters about it, though in so being, I should, it may be, speak of things which by some people may be thought trivial).

'On each of the four squares of the Beat is a little room built, and over everyone of them is a little chamber with windows all round it, in which chambers the Em- aums (together with the Mezzins) perform Sallah, in the audience of all the people which are below. These four chambers are built one at each square of the Beat, bv reason that there are four sorts of Mahometans. The rst are called Hanifee ; most of them are Turks.

It is made some what like the tombstones which people of fashion have among us, but with a very handsome imbroidered cover ing. Into this persons are apt to gaze. A small dis tance from it, on the left-hand, is a well, which they call Beer el Zem Zem, the water whereof they call holy water; and as superstitiously esteem it as the Papists do theirs. In the month of Ramadan they will be sure to break their fast with it. They report that it is as sweet as milk; but for my part I could perceive no other taste in it than in common water, except that it was somewhat brackish. The Hagges, when they come first to Mecca, drink of it unreasonably ; by which means they are not only much purged, but their flesh breaks out all in pimples ; and this they call the purging of their spiritual corruptions. 1 here are hundreds of pitchers belonging to the temple, which in the month of Ramadan are filled with the said water and placed all along before the people (with cups to drink) as they are kneeling and waiting for Acsham-nomas, or evening service ; and as soon as the Mezzins or clerks on the tops of the minarets began their bawling to call them to nomas, they fall a drinking thereof before they begin their devotions. This Beer or well of Zem Zem is in the midst of one of the little rooms before mentioned, at each square of the Beat, distant about twelve or fourteen paces from it, out of which four men are employed to draw water, without any pay or reward, for any that shall desire it. Each of these men have two leather buckets tied to a rope on a small wheel, one of which comes up full, while the other goes down empty. They do not only drink this water, but oftentimes bathe themselves with it, at which time they take off their clothes, only covering their lower parts with a thin wrapper, and one of the drawers pours on each person's head five or six buckets of water. 1 The i (Pitts' Note.) The worthy Mons. Thevenot saith, that theAppendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 373 person bathing may lawfully wash himself therewith above the middle, but not his lower parts, because they account they are not worthy, only letting the water take its way downwards. In short, they make use of this water only to drink, take Abdes, and for bathing 1 neither may they take Abdes with it, unless they first cleanse their secret parts with other common water. Yea, such an high esteem they have for it, that many Hagges carry it home to their respective countries in little latten or tin pots ; and present it to their friends, half a spoonful, may be, to each, who receive it in the hollow of their hand with great care and abundance of thanks, sipping a little of it, and bestowing the rest on their faces and naked heads ; at the same time holding up their hands, and desiring of God that they also may be so happy and prosperous as to go on pilgrimage to Mecca. The reason of their putting such an high value upon the water of this well, is because (as they say) it is the place where Ishmael was laid by his mother Hagar. I have heard them tell the story exactly as it is recorded in the 21st chapter of Genesis ; and they say, that in the very place where the child paddled with his feet, the water flowed out. ' I shall now inform you how, when, and where, they receive the honourable title of Hagges, for which they are at all this pains and expence. ' The Curbaen Byram, or the Feast of Sacrifice, follows two months and ten days after the Ramadan fast. The eighth day after the said two months they all enter into Hirrawem, i.e. put on their mortifying habit again, and in that manner go to a certain hill called Gibbel el Orphat (El Arafat), i.e. the Mountain of Knowledge ; for waters of Meccah are bitter; but I never found them so, but as sweet and as good as any others, for aught as I could perceive. Pitts has just remarked that he found the waters of Zemzem brackish. To my taste it was a salt-bitter, which was exceedingly disagreeable. (R. F. B.)374 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. there, they say, Adam first found and knew his wife Eve. And they likewise say, that she was buried at Gidda near the Red Sea ; at whose sepulchre all the Hagges who come to Mecca by way of the Red Sea, perform two Erkaets-nomas, and, I think, no more. I could not but smile to hear this their ridiculous tradition (for so I must pronounce it), when observing the marks which were set, the one at the head, and the other at the foot of the grave: I guessed them to be a bow-shot distant from each other. On the middle of her supposed grave is a little Mosque built, where the Hagges pay their religious respect. ' This Gibbel or hill is not so big as to contain the vast multitudes which resort thither; for it is said by them, that there meet no less than 70,000 souls every year, in the ninth day after the two months after Ramadan; and if it happen that in any year there be wanting some of that number, God, they say, will supply the deficiency by so many angels. 1 ' I do confess the number of Hagges I saw at this mountain was very great; nevertheless, I cannot think they could amount to so many as 70,000. There are certain bound-stones placed round the Gibbel, in the plain, to shew how far the sacred ground (as they esteem it) extends; and many are so zealous as to come and pitch their tents within these bounds, some time before the hour of paying their devotion here comes, waiting for it. But why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place, and receive from hence the title of Hagges, I confess I do not more fully understand than what I have already said, giving but little heed to these delusions. I observed nothing worth seeing on this hill, for there was only a small cupola on the top of it : 1 They are not so modest. 600,000 is the mystical number, others declare it to be incalculable. Oftentimes 70,000 have met at Arafat. 2 The cupola has now disappeared ; there is a tall pillar 0 masonry-work, whitewashed, rising from a plastered floor, for praying-Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 375 neither are there any inhabitants nearer to it than Mecca. About one or two of the clock, which is the time of Eulea-nomas, having washed and made themselves ready for it, they perform that, and at the same time perform Ekinde-nomas, which they never do at one time, but upon this occasion ; because at the time when Ekinde- nomas should be performed in the accustomed order, viz. about four of the clock in the afternoon, they are imploring pardon for their sins, and receiving the Emaum's benediction. 1 ' It was a sight indeed, able to pierce one's heart, to behold so many thousands in their garments of humility and mortification, with their naked heads, and cheeks watered with tears ; and to hear their grievous sighs and sobs, begging earnestly for the remission of their sins, promising newness of life, using a form of penitential expressions, and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours, viz. until the time of Acsham-nomas, which is to be performed about half an hour after sunset. (It is matter of sorrowful reflection, to compare the indifference of many Christians with this zeal of these poor blind Mahometans, who will, it is to be feared, rise up in judgment against them and condemn them.) After their solemn performance of their devotions thus at the Gibbel, they all at once receive that honourable title of Hagge from the Emaum, and are so stiled to their dying day. Immediately upon their receiving this name, the trumpet is sounded, and they all leave the hill and return for Mecca, and being gone two or three miles on their way. they then rest for that night 3 ; but after nomas, before 1 On the 9th Zu'l Hijjah, or the Day of Arafat, the pilgrims, having taken their stations within the sacred limits, perform ablution about noon, and pray as directed at that hour. At three p.m., after again performing the usual devotions, or more frequently after neglecting them, they repair to the hill, and hear the sermon. 2 At Muzdalifah.376 Pilgriniage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. they go to rest, each person gathers nine-and-forty small stones about the bigness of an hazle nut; the meaning of which I shall acquaint you with presently. 'The next morning they move to a place called Mina, or Muna; the place, as they say, where Abraham went to offer up his son Isaac, 1 and therefore in this place they sacrifice their sheep. It is about two or three miles from Mecca. I was here shown a stone, or little rock, which was parted in the middle. They told me, that when Abraham was going to sacrifice his son, instead of strik ing him. Providence directed his hand to this stone, which he clave in two. It must be a good stroke indeed! ' Here they all pitch their tents (it being in a spacious plain), and spend the time of Curbaen Byram, viz. three days. As soon as their tents are pitched, and all things orderly disposed, every individual Hagge, the first day, goes and throws seven of the small stones, which they had gathered, against a small pillar, or little square stone building. 3 Which action of theirs is intended to testify their defiance of the devil and his deeds; for they at the same time pronounce the following words, viz. Erzum le Shetane wazbehe 8 ; i.e. stone the devil, and them that please him. 4 And there are two other of the like pillars, which are situated near one another; at each of which 1 This, I need scarcely say, is speaking as a Christian. All Moslems believe that Ishmael, and not Isaac, was ordered to be sacrificed. The place to which Pitts alludes is still shown to pilgrims. 2 (Pitts' Note.) Monsieur de Thevenot saith, that they throw these stones at the Gibbsl or Mount; but, indeed, it is otherwise: though I must needs say, he is very exact in almost every thing of Turkish matters; and I pay much deference to that great author. 3 The Rami or Jaculator now usually says, as he casts each stone, 'In the name of Allah, and Allah is omnipotent (Raghman li'sh' Shaytani wa Khizyatih), in token of abhorrence to Satan, and for his ignominy (I do this).' 4 The Arabic would mean stone the devil and slay him, unless 'wazbehe' be an error for 'wa ashabih,'—'and his companions.'Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. small niean all three), the second day, they throw seven ng of stones; and the same they do the third day. As 1 was going to perform this ceremony of throwing the stones, Vlina, a facetious Hagge met me; saith he, 'You may save went your labour at present, if you please, for I have hit out they the devil's eyes already.' You must observe, that after from tlle y have thrown the seven stones on the first day (the vhich country people having brought great flocks of sheep to be when sold), every one buys a sheep and sacrifices it; some of strik- which they give to their friends, some to the poor which vhich come out of Mecca and the country adjacent, very ragged poor, and the rest they eat themselves; after cious which they shave their heads, throw off Hirrawem, and three P u t on other clothes, and then salute one another with a hings kiss, saying, 'Byram Mabarick Ela,' i.e. the feast be a ( } a y ) blessing to you. they 'These three days of Byram they spend festivally, stone rejoicing with abundance of illuminations all night, shoot- sstify in g of guns, and fireworks flying in the air; for they t the reckon that all their sins are now done away, and they im le shall &gt; when they die, go directly to heaven, if they don't that apostatize; and that for the future, if they keep their vow liars, anc ^ do well, God will set down for every good action ten; diich hut if they do ill, God will likewise reckon every evil —^ action ten; and any person, who, after having received to be the title of Ha gg e » shall fall back to a vicious course jrims. of life, is esteemed to be very vile and infamous by them. 1 throw 'Some have written, that many of the Hagges, rwise; after they have returned home, have been so austere to n S o{ themselves as to pore a long time over red-hot bricks, or stone * n ^ ots of iron, and by that means willingly lose their li'sh* Slgilt » desiring to see nothing evil or profane, after so brhis sacred a sight as the temple at Mecca; but I never knew any such thing done. unless ! Even in the present day, men who have led 'wild' lives in their youth, often date their reformation from the first pilgrimage.378 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. 'During their three days' stay at Mina, scarce any Hagge (unless impotent) but thinks it his duty to pay his visit, once at least, to the temple at Mecca. They scarce cease running all the way thitherward, shewing their vehement desire to have a fresh sight of the Beat-Allah; which as soon as ever they come in sight of, they burst into tears for joy ; and after having performed Towoaf for a while, and a few Erkaets, they return again to Mina. And when the three days of Byram are expired, they all, with their tents, &amp;c., come back again to Mecca. ' They say, that after the Hagges are gone from Mina to Mecca, God doth usually send a good shower of rain to wash away the filth and dung of the sacrifices there slain ; and also that those vast numbers of little stones, which I told you the Hagges throw in defiance of the devil, are all carried away by the angels before the year comes about again. But I am sure I saw vast numbers of them that were thrown the year before, lie upon the ground. After they are returned to Mecca, they can tarry there no longer than the stated time, which is about ten or twelve days; during which time there is a great fair held, where are sold all manner of East India goods, and abundance of fine stones for rings and bracelets, &amp;c., brought from Yeamane 1 ; also of China-ware and musk, and variety of other curiosities. Now is the time in which the Hagges are busily employed in buying, for they do not think it lawful to buy any thing till they have received the title of Hagge. Every one almost now buys a caffin, or shroud of fine linen, to be buried in (for they never use coffins for that purpose), which might have been procured at Algier, or their other respective homes, at a much cheaper rate; but they choose to buy it here, because they have the advantage of dipping it in the holy water, Zem Zem. They are very careful to carry the said i Al-Yaman, Southern Arabia, whose 'Akik,' or cornelians were celebrated.Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 379 caffin with them wherever they travel, whether by sea or land, that they may be sure to be buried therein. 'The evening before they leave Mecca, every one must go to take their solemn leave of the Beat, entering at the gate called Babe el Salem, i.e. Welcome Gate, and having continued at Towoaf as long as they please, which many do till they are quite tired, and it being the last time of their paying their devotions to it, they do it with floods of tears, as being extremely unwil ling to part and bid farewell; and having drank their fill of the water Zem Zem, they go to one side of the Beat, their backs being towards the door called by the name of Babe el Weedoh i.e., the Farewell Door, which is opposite to the welcome door; where, having performed two or three Erkaets, they get upon their legs and hold up their hands towards the Beat, making earnest petitions ; and then keep going backward till they come to the above said farewell gate, being guided by some other, for they account it a very irreverent thing to turn their backs towards the Beat when they take leave of it. All the way as they retreat they continue petitioning, holding up their hands, with their eyes fixed upon the Beat, till they are out of sight of it ; and so go to their lodgings weeping. ' Ere I leave Mecca, I shall acquaint you with a passage of a Turk to me in the temple cloyster, in the night time, between Acsham-nomas, and Gega-nomas, i-e., between the evening and the night services. The Hagges do usually spend that time, or good part of it (which is about an hour and half), at Towoaf, and then sit down on the mats and rest themselves. This I did, and after I had sat a while, and for my more ease at last was lying on my back, with my feet towards the Beat, but at a distance as many others did, a Turk which sat by me, asked me what countryman I was ; 'A Mogrebee' (said I), i.e. one of the West. 4 Pray,' quoth he, ' how far west did you come ?' I told him from Gazair, i .e. Algier. ' Ah 1' replied he, ' have you taken so much380 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. pains, and been at so much cost, and now be guilty of this irreverent posture before the Beat Allah ?' ' Here are many Moors, who get a beggarly live lihood by selling models of the temple unto strangers, and in being serviceable to the Pilgrims. Here are also several Effendies, or masters of learning, who daily expound out of the Alcoran, sitting in high chairs, and some of the learned Pilgrims, whilst they are here, do undertake the same. ' Under the room of the Hanifees (which I mentioned before), people do usually gather together (between the hours of devotion), and sitting round cross-legged, it may be, twenty or thirty of them, they have a very large pair of Tessbeehs, or beads, each bead near as big as a man's fist, which they keep passing round, bead after bead, one to the other, all the time, using some devout expressions. I myself was once got in amongst them, and methought it was a pretty play enough for children,—however, I was to appearance very devout. ' There are likewise some dervises that get money here, as well as at other places, by burning of incense, swinging their censers as they go along before the people that are sitting ; as this they do commonly on Friday, their Sabbath. In all other Gamiler or Mosques, when the Hattib is preaching, and the people all sitting still at their devotion, they are all in ranks, so that the dervise, without the least disturbance to any, walks between every rank, with his censer in one hand, ane with the other takes his powdered incense out of a little pouch that hangs by his side. 1 ' But though this place, Mecca, is esteemed so very holy, yet it comes short of none for lewdness anc debauchery. As for uncleanness, it is equal to Grancj Cairo ; and they will steal even in the temple itself. 1 This is still practised in Moslem countries, being considered s decent way of begging during public prayers, without interruptin? them.Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 381 ' Chapter VIII, — Of the Pilgrims' return from Mecca: their visit made at Medina to Mahomet's tomb there. 'Having thus given you an account of the Turks' pilgrimage to Mecca, and of their worship there (the manner and circumstances of which I have faithfully and punctually related, and may challenge the world to convict me of a known falsehood), I now come to take leave of the temple and town of Mecca. ' Having hired camels of the carriers, we set out, but we give as much for the hire of one from Mecca to Egypt, which is about forty days' journey, as the real worth of it is, (viz.) about five or six pounds sterling. If it happen that the camel dies by the way, the carrier is to supply us with another; and therefore, those carriers 1 who come from Egypt to Mecca with the Caravan, bring with them several spare camels; for there is hardly a night passeth but many die upon the road, for if a camel should chance to fall, it is seldom known that it is able to rise again; and if it should, they despair of its being capable of performing the journey, or ever being useful more. It is a common thing, therefore, when a camel once falls, to take off its burden and put it on another, and then kill it; which the poorer sort of the company eat. I myself have eaten of camel's flesh, and it is very sweet and nourishing. If a camel tires, they even leave him upon the place. 'The first day we set out from Mecca, it was without any order at all, all hurly burly; but the next day every one laboured to get forward; and in order to it, there was many time much quarrelling and fighting. But after every one had taken his place in the Caravan, they orderly and peaceably kept the same place till they came to Grand Cairo. They travel four camels in a breast, 1 These people will contract to board the pilgrim, and to provide him with a tent, as well as to convey his luggage.382 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. which are all tied one after the other, like as in teams. 1 1 The whole body is called a Caravan, which is divided 1 into several cottors, or companies, each of which hath I its name, and consists, it may be, of several thousand ; camels; and they move one cottor after another, like distinct troops. In the head of each cottor is some great gentleman or officer, who is carried in a thing like a horse-litter, borne by two camels, one before and the other behind, which is covered all over with sear-cloth, and over that again with green broad cloth, and set forth very handsomely. If the said great person hath a wife with him, she is carried in another of the same. 2 In the head of every cottor there goes, likewise, a sumpter camel which carries his treasures, &amp;c. This camel hath two bells, about the bigness of our market-bells, having one on each side, the sound of which may be heard a great way off. Some other of the camels have round bells about their necks, some about their legs, like those which our carriers put about their fore-horses' necks; which together with the servants (who belong to the camels, and travel on foot) singing all night, make a pleasant noise, and the journey passes away delightfully. They say this musick make the camels brisk and lively. Thus they travel, in good order every day, till they come to Grand Cairo; and were it not for this order, you may guess what confusion would be amongst such a vast multitude. ' They have lights by night (which is the chief time of travelling, because of the exceeding heat of the sun by ■ day), which are carried on the tops of high poles, to direct the Hagges on their march. 8 They are somewhat like 1 The usual way now is in ' Kitar,' or in Indian file, each camel s| halter being tied to the tail of the beast that precedes him. Pit's i 'cottor' must be a kitar, but he uses the word in another of its numerous senses. 2 This vehicle is the ' Takht-rawan ' of Arabia. 3 He describes the Mashals still in use. Lane has sketched j them, Mod, Egypt, chap. vi.Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 383 iron stoves, into which they put short dry wood, which some of the camels are loaded with ; it is carried in great sacks, which have an hole near the bottom, where the servants take it out, as they see the fires need a recruit. Every cottor hath one of these poles belonging to it, some of which have ten, some twelve, of these lights on their tops, or more or less; and they are likewise of different figures as well as numbers; one, perhaps, oval way, like a gate; another triangular, or like an N or M, &amp;c., so that every one knows by them his respective cottor. They are carried in the front, and set up in the place where the Caravan is to pitch, before that comes up, at some distance from one another. They are also carried by day, not lighted, but yet by the figure and number of them, the Hagges are directed to what cottor they belong, as soldiers are, by their colours, where to rendezvous ; and without such directions it would be impossible to avoid confusion in such a vast number of people. 'Every day, viz. in the morning, they pitch their tents, and rest several hours. When the camels are unloaded the owners drive them to water, and give them their provender, &amp;c. So that we had nothing to do with them, besides helping to load them. 'As soon as our tents were pitched, my business was to make a little fire and get a pot of coffee. When we had ate some small matter and drank the coffee, we lay down to sleep. Between eleven and twelve we boiled something for dinner, and having dined, lay down again, till about four in the afternoon; when the trumpet was sounded which gave notice to every one to take down their tents, pack up their things, and load their camels in order to proceed on their journey. It takes up about two hours time ere they are in all their places again. At the time of Acsham-nomas, and also Gega-nomas, they make a halt, and perform their Sallah (so punctual384 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. are they in their worship), and then they travel till next morning. If water be scarce, what I call an imaginary Abdes 1 will do. As for ancient men, it being very troublesome for such to alight off the camels, and get up again, it is lawful for them to defer these two times of nomas till the next day; but they will be sure to perform it then. ' As for provisions, we bring enough out of Egypt to suffice us till we return thither again. At Mecca we compute how much will serve us for one day, and conse quently, for the forty days' journey to Egypt, and if we find we have more than we may well guess will suffice us for a long time, we sell the overplus at Mecca. There is a charity maintained by the Grand Seignior, for water to refresh the poor who travel on foot all the way; for there are many such undertake this journey (or pilgrimage) without any money, relying on the charity of the Hagges for subsistence, knowing that they largely extend it at such a time. ' Every Hagge carries his provisions, water, bed ding, &amp;c., with him, and usually three or four diet to gether, and sometimes discharge a poor man's expenses the whole journey for his attendance on them. There was an Irish renegade, who was taken very young, insomuch that he had not only lost his Christian religion, but his native language also. This man had endured thirty years slavery in Spain, and in the French gallies, but was afterwards redeemed and came home to Algier. He was looked upon as a very pious man, and a great Zealot, by the Turks, for his not turning from the Mahommedan faith, notwithstanding the great temptations he had so to do. Some of my neighbours who intended for Mecca, the same year I went with my patroon thither, offered 1 Pitts means by ' imaginary Abdes,' the sand ablution,—lawful when water is wanted for sustaining life.Appendix V.—Pilgrimage of Joseph Pitts. 385 this renegado that if he would serve them on this journey they would defray his charges throughout. He gladly embraced the offer, and I remember when we arrived at Mecca he passionately told me, that God had delivered him out of hell upon earth (meaning his former slavery in France and Spain), and had brought him into a heaven upon earth, viz. Mecca. I admired much his zeal, but pitied his condition. 'Their water they carry in goats' skins, which they fasten to one side of their camels. It sometimes happens that no water is to be met with for two, three, or more days; but yet it is well known that a camel is a creature that can live long without drinking (God in his wise provi dence so ordering it: for otherwise it would be very diffi cult, if not impossible to travel through the parched deserts of Arabia). ' In this journey many times the skulking, thievish, Arabs do much mischief to some of the Hagges; for in the night time they will steal upon them (especially such as are on the outside of the Caravan), and being taken to be some of the servants that belong to the carriers, or owners of the camels, they are not suspected. When they see an Hagge fast asleep (for it is usual for them to sleep on the road), they loose a camel before and behind, and one of the thieves leads it away with the Hagge upon its back asleep. Another of them in the meanwhile, pulls on the next camel to tie it to the camel from whence the halter of the other was cut ; for if that camel be not fastened again to the leading camel, it will stop, and all that are behind will then stop of course, which might be the means of discovering the robbers. When they have gotten the stolen camel, with his rider, at a convenient distance from the Caravan, and think themselves out of danger, they awake the Hagge, and sometimes destroy him immediately; but at other times, being a little more vol. 11. 25386 Pilgrimcige to Al-Mcidincih and Mcccah. inclined to mercy, they strip him naked, and let him return to the Caravan. 1 ' About the tenth easy day's journey, after we come out of Mecca, we enter into Medina, the place where Mahomet lies entombed. Although it be (as I take it) two or three days' journey out of the direct way from Mecca to Egypt, yet the Hagges pay their visit there for the space of two days, and come away the third. 'Those Mahometans which live to the southward01 Mecca, at the East Indies, and thereaway, are not bound to make a visit to Medina, but to Mecca only, because it would be so much out of their way. But such as come from Turkey, Tartary, Egypt, and Africa, think them selves obliged to do so. , ' Medina is but a little town, and poor, yet it is walled round, 3 and hath in it a great Mosque, but nothing near so big as the temple at Mecca. In one corner of the Mosque is a place, built about fourteen or fifteen paces square. About this place are great windows, 3 fenced with brass grates. In the inside it is decked with some lamps, and ornaments. It is arched all over head. (I find some relate, that there are no less than 3000 lamps abou: Mahomet's tomb ; but it is a mistake, for there are not, as I verily believe, an hundred ; and I speak what I know, and have been an eye-witness of). In the middle of this place is the tomb of Mahomet, where the corpse of thai bloody impostor is laid, which hath silk curtains all aroun. it like a bed ; which curtains are not costly nor beautitui There is nothing of his tomb to be seen by any, by rea sft- 1 As I shall explain at a future time, there are still some Hijai Badawin whose young men. before entering life, risk everything order to plunder a Haji.

All the privilege the Hagges have, is only to thrust in their hands at the windows, 2 between the brass grates, and to petition the dead juggler, which they do with a wonderful deal of reverence, affection, and zeal. My patroon had his silk handkerchief stole out of his bosom, while he stood at his devotion here. ' It is storied by some, that the coffin of Mahomet hangs up by the attractive virtue of a loadstone to the roof of the Mosque ; but believe me it is a false story. When I looked through the brass gate, I saw as much as any of the Hagges; and the top of the curtains, which covered the tomb, were not half so high as the roof or arch; so that it is impossible his coffin should be hanging there. I never heard the Mahometans say anything like it. On the outside of this place, where Mahomet s tomb is, are some sepulchres of their reputed saints ; among which is one prepared for Jesus Christ, when he shall come again personally into the world ; for they hold that Christ will come again in the flesh, forty years before the end of the world, to confirm the Mahometan faith, and say likewise, that our Saviour was not crucified in person, but in effigy, or one like him. ' Medina is much supplied by the opposite Abyssine country, which is on the other side of the Red Sea : from thence they have corn and necessaries brought in ships: an odd sort of vessels as ever I saw, their sails being made of matting, such as they use in the houses and Mosques to tread upon. 1 This account is perfectly correct. The Eunuchs, however, do not go into the tomb ; they only light the lamps in, and sweep the passage round, the Sepulchre. 2 These are the small apertures in the Southern grating. See Chap. xvi.388 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. ' When we had taken our leave of Medina, the third day, and travelled about ten days more, we were met by a great many Arabians, who brought abundance of fruit to us, particularly raisins ; but from whence I cannot tell. 1 When we came within fifteen days' journey of Grand Cairo, we were met by many people who came from thence, with their camels laden with presents for the Hagges, sent from their friends and relations, as sweet meats, &amp;c. But some of them came rather for profit, to sell fresh provisions to the Hagges, and trade with them, ' About ten days before we got to Cairo, we came to a very long steep hill, called Ackaba, which the Hagges are usually much afraid how they shall be able to get up. Those who can will walk it. The poor camels, having no hoofs, find it very hard work, and many drop here. They were all untied, and we dealt gently with them, moving very slowly, and often halting. Before we came to this hill, I observed no descent, and when we were at the top there was none, but all plain as before. ' We past by Mount Sinai by night, and, perhaps, when I was asleep ; so that I had no prospect of it. ' When we came within seven days'journey of Cairo, we were met by abundance of people more, some hundreds, who came to welcome their friends and re lations; but it being night, it was difficult to find those they wanted, and, therefore, as the Caravans past along they kept calling them aloud by their names, and by this means found them out. And when we were in three days journey of it, we had many camel-loads of the water of the Nile brought us to drink. But the day and nigh before we came to Cairo, thousands came out to meet us with extraordinary rejoicing.

Giovanni Finati. T he third pilgrim on our list is Giovanni Finati who, under the Moslem name of ' Haji Mohammed, made the campaign against the Wahhabis for the re covery of Meccah and Al-Madinah. A native of Ferrara. the eldest of the four scions of a small landed proprietor, • tenderly attached to his mother,' and brought up mos: unwillingly for a holy vocation,—to use his own words. ' instructed in all that course of frivolous and empty ceremonials and mysteries, which form a principal feature in the training of a priest for the Romish Church,' in a.d. 1805, Giovanni Finati's name appeared in the listo: Italian conscripts. After a few vain struggles with fate, he was marched to Milan, drilled and trained ; the next year his division was ordered to the Tyrol, where the young man, ' brought up for the church,' instantly deserted. Discovered in his native town, he was seal under circumstances of suitable indignity to join his regiment at Venice, where a general act of grace, pro mulgated on occasion of Napoleon's short visit, preserved him from a platoon of infantry. His next move waste Spalato, in Dalmatia, where he marched under Genera: Marmont to Cattaro, the last retreat of the hardy anfl warlike Montenegrins. At Budoa, a sea-port S.E. 01 Ragusa, having consulted an Albanian 'captain -mer chant,' Giovanni Finati, and fifteen other Italians-Appendix VI.—Giovanni Finati. 391 «including the sergeant's wife,' swore fidelity to one another, and deserted with all their arms and accoutre ments. They passed into the Albanese territory, and were hospitably treated as ' soldiers, who had deserted from the infidel army in Dalmatia,' by the Pasha, posted at Antivari to keep check upon the French operations. At first they were lodged in the Mosque, and the ser geant's wife had been set apart from the rest; but as they refused to apostatize they were made common slaves, and worked at the quarries till their ' backs were sore.' Under these circumstances, the sergeant dis covering and promulgating his discovery that ' the Mahometans believe as we do in a god; and upon examination that we might find the differences from our mother church to be less than we had imagined,'—all at once came the determination olprofessing to be Moham medans. Our Italian Candide took the name of Mahomet, and became pipe-bearer to a Turkish general officer in the garrison. This young man trusted the deserter to such an extent that the doors of the Harim were open to him, and Giovanni Finati repaid his kindness by seducing Fatimah, a Georgian girl, his master's favourite wife. The garrison then removed to Scutari. Being of course hated by his fellow servants, the renegade at last fell into disgrace, and exchanging the pipe-stick for the hatchet, he became a hewer of wood. This degradation did not diminish poor Fatimah's affection; she continued to visit him, and to leave little presents and tokens for him in his room. But presently the girl proved likely to become a mother,—their intercourse was more than suspected,—Giovanni Finati had a dread of circumcision/ 1 He describes the Harim as containing ' the females of different countries, all of them young, and all more or less attractive, and the merriest creatures I ever saw.' His narration proves that affection and fidelity were not wanting there. 2 Mr. Bankes, Finati's employer and translator, here comments upon Ali Bey's assertion, ' Even to travellers in Mahometan coun-392 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. so he came to the felon resolution of flying alone from Scutari. He happened to meet his ' original friend the captain-merchant,' and in March, 1809, obtained from him a passage to Egypt, the Al-Dorado to which all poverty-struck Albanian adventurers were then flocking. At Alexandra the new Mahomet, after twice deserting from a Christian service, at the risk of life and honour, voluntarily enlisted as an Albanian private soldier in a Moslem land; the naivete with which he admires and comments upon his conduct is a curious moral phenom enon. 1 hence he proceeded to Cairo, and became a ' Balik bash ' (corporal), in charge of six Albanian pri vates, of Mohammed Ali's body-guard. Ensued a cam- paign against the Mamluks in Upper Egypt, and his being present at the massacre of those miscreants in the citadel of Cairo,—he confined his part in the affair to plundering from the Beys a ' saddle richly mounted in silver gilt,' and a slave girl with trinkets and money. He married the captive, and was stationed for six months at Matariyah (Heliopolis), with the force preparing to march upon Meccah, under Tussun Pasha. Here he suffered from thieves, and shot by mistake his Bim Bash! or sergeant, who was engaged in the unwonted and dan gerous exercise of prayer in the dark. The affair was compromised by the amiable young commander-in-chief, who paid the blood money amounting to some thousand piastres. On the 6th October, 1811, the army started for Suez, where eighteen vessels waited to convey them to Yambu'. Mahomet assisted at ths capture of that port, and was fortunate enough to escape alive from the desperate action of Jadaydah. 1 Rheumatism obliged him tries, I look upon the safety of their journey as almost impossible, un less they have previously submitted to the rite.' Ali Bey is correct; the danger is doubled by non-compliance with the custom. Mr. Bankes apprehends that 'very few renegadoes do submit to it.' In bigoted Moslem countries, it is considered a sine qud non. J 1 See Chap. xiii. of this work.Appendix VI.—Giovanni Finati. 393 to return to Cairo, where he began by divorcing his wife for great levity of conduct. In the early part of 1814, Mahomet, inspired by the news of Mohammed Ali Pasha's success in Al-Hijaz, joined a reinforcement of Albanians, travelled to Suez, touched at Yambu' and at Jeddah, assisted at the siege and capture of Kunfudah, and was present at its recapture by the Wahhabis. Wounded, sick, harassed by the Badawin, and disgusted by his com manding officer, he determined to desert again, adding, as an excuse, ' not that the step, on my part at least, had the character of a complete desertion, since I intended to join the main body of the army;' and to his mania for desertion we owe the following particulars concerning the city of Meccah. ' Exulting in my escape, my mind was in a state to receive very strong impressions, and I was much struck with all I saw upon entering the city ; for though it is neither large nor beautiful in itself, there is something in it that is calculated to impress a sort of awe, and it was the hour of noon when everything is very silent, except the Muezzins calling from the minarets. * * 5;: s;: * * ' The principal feature of the city is that celebrated sacred enclosure which is placed about the centre of it; it is a vast paved court with doorways opening into it from every side, and with a covered colonnade carried all round like a cloister, while in the midst of the open space stands the edifice called the Caaba, whose walls are en tirely covered over on the outside with hangings of rich velvet, 1 on which there are Arabic inscriptions em broidered in gold. ' Facing one of its angles (for this little edifice is of 1 ' Black cloth, according to Ali Bey; and I believe he is cor rect. So Mr. Bankes. If Ali Bey meant broad-cloth, both are in error, as the specimen in my possession—a mixture of silk and cotton —proves.394 Pilgnniage to Al-Maclinah and Meccah. a square form), 1 there is a well which is called the well Zemzem, of which the water is considered so peculiarly holy that some of it is even sent annually to the Sultan at Constantinople; and no person who comes to Meccah, whether on pilgrimage or for mere worldly considerations, ever fails both to drink of it and to use it in his ablutions, since it is supposed to wipe out the stain of all past transgressions. ' There is a stone also near the bottom of the build ing itself which all the visitants kiss as they pass round it, and the multitude of them has been so prodigious as to have worn the surface quite away. ' Quite detached, but fronting to the Caaba, stand four pavilions (corresponding to the four sects of the Mahometan religion), adapted for the pilgrims; and though the concourse had of late years been from time to time much interrupted, there arrived just when I came to Meccah two Caravans of them, one Asiatic and one from the African side, amounting to not less than about 40,000 persons, who all seemed to be full of reverence towards the holy place. 2 ' After commenting on the crowded state of the city, the lodging of pilgrims in tents and huts, or on the bare ground outside the walls, 8 and the extravagant prices of provisions, Haji Mahomet proceeds with his description. ' Over and above the general ceremonies of the purification at the well, and of the kissing of the corner* 1 AH Bey showed by his measurements that no two sides corres pond exactly. To all appearance the sides are equal, though it is certain they are not; the height exceeds the length and the breadth 2 Ali Bey (a.d. 1807) computes 80,000 men, 2,000 women, and 1,000 children at Arafat. Burckhardt (a.d. 1814) calculated it at 70,000. I do not think that in all there were more than 50,000 souls assembled together in 1853. 3 Rich pilgrims always secure lodgings; the poorer class cannot j afford them ; therefore, the great Caravans from Egypt, Damascus, Baghdad, and other places, pitch on certain spots outside the city.Appendix VI.—Giovanni Finati. 395 stone, 1 and of the walking round the Caaba a certain number of times in a devout manner, every one has also his own separate prayers to put up, and so to fulfil the conditions of his vow and the objects of his particular pilgrimage.' We have then an account of the Mosque-pigeons, for whom it is said, ' some pilgrims bring with them even from the most remote countries a small quantity of grain, with which they may take the opportunity of feeding these birds.' This may have occurred in times of scarcity; the grain is now sold in the Mosque. ' The superstitions and ceremonies of the place,' we are told, ' are by no means completed within the city, for the pilgrims, after having performed their devotions for a certain time at the Caaba, at last in a sort of procession go to a place called Arafat, an eminence which stands detached in the centre of a valley; and in the way thither there is a part of the road for about the space of a mile where it is customary to run. 2 The road also passes near a spot where was formerly a well which is superstitiously sup posed to be something unholy and cursed by the Prophet himself. And for this reason, every pilgrim as he goes by it throws a stone ; and the custom is so universal and has prevailed so long that none can be picked up in the neigh bourhood, and it is necessary therefore to provide them from a distance, and some persons even bring them out of their own remote countries, thinking thereby to gain the greater favour in the sight of Heaven. 3 1 An incorrect expression ; the stone is fixed in a massive gold or silver gilt circle to the S.E. angle, but it is not part of the building. 2 Ali Bey is correct in stating that the running is on the return from Arafat, directly after sunset. 3 This sentence abounds in blunders. Sale, Ali Bey, and Burck- hardt, all give correct accounts of the little pillar of masonry—it has nothing to do with the well—which denotes the place where Satan appeared to Abraham, The pilgrims do not throw one stone, but396 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. ti Beyond this point stands a column, 1 which is set up as the extreme limit of the pilgrimage, and this every pilgrim must have passed before sunrise ; while all such as have not gone beyond it by that time must wait till the next year, if they wish to be entitled to the consideration and privileges of complete Hajis, since, without this cir cumstance, all the rest remains imperfect. ' The hill of Arafat lying at a distance of seven hours from Meccah, it is necessary to set out very early in order to be there in time; many of the pilgrims, and especially the more devout amongst them, performing all the way on foot. 'When they have reached the place 3 all who have any money according to their means sacrifice a sheep, and the rich often furnish those who are poor and desti tute with the means of buying one. ' Such a quantity of sacrifices quite fills the whole open space with victims, and the poor flock from all the country round to have meat distributed to them. ' After which, at the conclusion of the whole cere mony, all the names are registered by a scribe appointed for the purpose 3 : and when this is finished the African many. The pebbles are partly brought from Muzdalifah, partly from the valley of Muna, in which stands the pillar. 1 Mr. Bankes confounds this column with the Devil's Pillar at Muna. Finati alludes to the landmarks of the Arafat plain, now called Al-Alamayn (the two marks). The pilgrims must stand within these boundaries on a certain day (the gth of Zu'l Hijjah), otherwise he has failed to observe a rital ordinance. 2 He appears to confound the proper place with Arafat. The sacrifice is performed in the valley of Muna, after leaving the moun tain. But Finati, we are told by his translator, wrote from memory —a pernicious practice for a traveller. 3 This custom is now obsolete, as regards the grand body of pilgrims. Anciently, a certificate from the Sharif was given to all who could afford money for a proof of having performed the pilgrim age, but no such practice at present exists. My friends have frequently asked me, what proof there is of a Moslem's having becomeAppendix VI.—Giovanni Finati. and Asiatic Caravans part company and return to their own several countries, many detachments of the pilgrims visiting Medinah in the way.' Being desirous of enrolment in some new division of Mohammed Ali's army, Finati overcame the difficulty of personal access to him by getting a memorial written in Turkish and standing at the window of a house joined on to the enclosure of the great temple. After the sixth day the Pasha observed him, and in the ' greatest rage imaginable ' desired a detailed account of the defeat at Kunfudah. Finati then received five hundred piastres and an order to join a corps at Taif, together with a strict charge of secresy, ' since it was of importance that no reverse or check should be generally talked of.' Before starting our author adds some 'singular particulars' which escaped him in his account of Meccah. 'Many of the pilgrims go through the ceremony of walking the entire circuit of the city upon the outside; and the order in which this is performed is as follows. The devoted first goes without the gates, and, after pre senting himself there to the religious officer who presides, throws off all his clothes, and takes a sort of large wrap ping garment in lieu of them to cover himself; upon which he sets off walking at a very quick pace, or rather running, to reach the nearest of the four corners of the city, a sort of guide going with him at the same rate all the way, who prompts certain ejaculations or prayers, which he ought to mention at particular spots as he passes ; at every angle he finds a barber, who with wonderful quickness wets and shaves one quarter of his head, and so on ; till he has reached the barber at the fourth angle, who completes the work. After which the a Haji. None whatever; consequently impostors abound. Sa'adi, in the Gulistan, notices a case. But the ceremonies of the Hajj are so complicated and unintelligible by mere description, that a little cross- questioning applied to the false Haji would easily detect him.398 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. pilgrim takes his clothes again, and has finished that act of devotion. 1 ' There is also near the holy city an eminence called the hill of light, 2 as I imagine from its remarkable white ness. Upon this the pilgrims have a custom of leaping while they repeat at the same time prayers and verses of the Koran. Many also resort to a lesser hill, about a mile distant from the city, on which there is a small Mosque, which is reputed as a place of great sanctity. ' An annual ceremony takes place in the great temple itself which is worth mentioning before I quit the subject altogether. ' I have already spoken of the little square building whose walls are covered with hangings of black and gold, and which is called the Caaba. Once in the year, 8 and once only, this holy of holies is opened, and as there is nothing to prevent admission it appears surprising at first to see so few who are willing to go into the interior, and especially since this act is supposed to have great efficacy in the remission of all past sins. But the reason must be sought for in the conditions which are annexed, since he who enters is, in the first place, bound to ex ercise no gainful pursuit, or trade, or to work for his liveli- 1 No wonder Mr. Bankes is somewhat puzzled by this passage. Certainly none but a pilgrim could guess that the author refers to the rites called Al-Umrah and Al-Sai, or the running between Mounts Safa and Marwah. The curious reader may compare the above with Burckhardt's correct description of the ceremonies. As regards the shaving, Finati possibly was right in his day ; in Ali Bey's, as in ray time, the head was only shaved once, and a few strokes of the razor sufficed for the purpose of religious tonsure. 2 Jabal Nur, anciently Hira, is a dull grey as of granite; it de rives its modern name from the spiritual light of religion. Circum stances prevented my ascending it, so I cannot comment upon Finati's 'custom of leaping.' 3 Open three days in the year, according to Ali Bey, the same in Burckhardfs, and in my time. Besides these public occasions, private largesses can always turn the key.Appendix VI.—Giovanni Finati. 399 hood in any way whatever ; and, next, he must submit patiently to all offences and injuries, and must never again touch anything that is impure or unholy. 1 ' ' One more remark with reference to the great scene of sacrifice at Arafat. Though the Pasha's power in Arabia had been now for some time established, yet it was not complete or universal by any means—the Wah- habees still retaining upon many sides a very considerable footing, so that open and unprotected places, even within half a day's journey of Meccah, might be liable to surprise and violence.' For these reasons, our author informs us, a sufficient force was disposed round Arafat, and the prodigious mul titude went and returned without molestation or insult. 3 1 I heard from good authority, that the Ka'abah is never opened without several pilgrims being crushed to death. Ali Bey (remarks Mr. Bankes) says nothing of the supposed conditions annexed. In my next volume [Part iii. (' Meccah') of this work] I shall give them, as I received them from the lips of learned and respectable Mos lems. They differ considerably from Finati's, and no wonder; his account is completely opposed to the strong good sense which pervades the customs of Al-Islam. As regards his sneer at the monastic orders in Italy—that the conditions of entering are stricter and more binding than those of the Ka'abah, yet that numbers are ready to profess in them—it must not be imagined that Arab human nature differs very materially from Italian. Many un worthy feet pass the threshold of the Ka'abah; but there are many Moslems, my friend, Omar Effendi, for instance, who have per formed the pilgrimage a dozen times, and would never, from con scientious motives, enter the holy edifice. 2 In 1807, according to Ali Bey, the Wahhabis took the same precaution, says Mr. Bankes. The fact is, some such precautions must always be taken. The pilgrims are forbidden to quarrel, to fight, or to destroy life, except under circumstances duly provided for. Moreover, as I shall explain in another part of this work, it was of old, and still is, the custom of the fiercer kind of Badawin to flock to Arafat—where the victim is sure to be found—for the purpose of revenging their blood-losses. As our authorities at Aden well know, there cannot be a congregation of different Arab tribes without a400 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. After the pilgrimage Haji Mahomet repaired to Taif. On the road he remarked a phenomenon observable' in Al-Hijaz—the lightness of the nights there. Finati attributes it to the southern position of the place. But, observing a perceptible twilight there, I was forced to seek further cause. May not the absence of vegetation, and the heat-absorbing nature of the soil,—granite, quartz, and basalt,—account for the phenomenon 1 ? The natives as usual, observing it, have invested its origin with the garb of fable. It is not my intention to accompany Mahomet to the shameful defeat of Taraba, where Tussun Pasha lost three quarters of his army, or to the glorious victory of Bissel, where Mohammed Ali on the 10th January, 1815, broke 24,000 Wahhabis commanded by Faysal bin Sa'ud. His account of this interesting campaign is not full or accurate like Mengin's; still, being the tale of an eye-witness, it attracts attention. Nothing can be more graphic than his picture of the old conqueror sitting with exulting countenance upon the carpet where he had vowed to await death or victory, and surrounded by heaps of enemies' heads. 1 Still less would it be to the purpose to describe the latter details of Haji Mahomet's career, his return to Cairo, his accompanying Mr. Bankes to upper Egypt and Syria, and his various trips to Aleppo, Kurdistan, the little murder. After fighting with the common foe, or if unable to fight with him, the wild men invariably turn their swords against their private enemies. 1 So, on the wild and tree-clad heights of the Neilgherry hills, despite the brilliance of the stars, every traveller remarks the darkness of the atmosphere at night. 2 Mohammed Ali gave six dollars for every Arab head, which fact accounts for the heaps that surrounded him. One would sup pose that when acting against an eneny, so quick and agile as the Arabs, such an order would be an unwise one. Experience, however, proves the contrary.Appendix VI.—Giovanni Finati. 401 1 to Sa'id, the great Oasis, Nabathaea, Senna'ar, and Dongola. able We concede to him the praise claimed by his translator, nati that he was a traveller to no ordinary extent; but beyond But, this we cannot go. He was so ignorant that he had forgotten to write 1 ; his curiosity and his powers of obser vation keep pace with his knowledge 2 ; his moral character as it appears in print is of that description which knows no sense of shame: it is not candour but sheer insen sibility which makes him relate circumstantially his repeated desertions, his betrayal of Fatimah, and his various plunderings. 1 ' Finati's long disuse of European writing,' says Mr. Bankes, ,, made him very slow with his pen.' Fortunately, he found in London some person who took down the story in easy, unaffected, and not inelegant Italian. In 1828, Mr. Bankes translated it into English, securing accuracy by consulting the author, when necessary. 2 His translator and editor is obliged to explain that he means Cufic, by ' characters that are not now in use,' and the statue of Memnon by ' one of two enormous sitting figures in the plain, from which, according to an old story or superstition, a sound proceeds when the sun rises.' When the crew of his Nile-boat ' form in circle upon the bank, and perform a sort of religious mummery, shaking their heads and shoulders violently, and uttering a hoarse sobbing or barking noise, till some of them would drop or fall into convulsions,'—a sight likely to excite the curiosity of most men—he 'takes his gun in pursuit of wild geese.' He allowed Mr. Bankes' mare to eat Oleander leaves, and thus to die of the commonest poison. Briefly, he seems to have been a man who, under favourable circum stances, learned as little as possible. bills, :ness hich sup- 1 the iver. vol. ii.gcq thej up. note it m ther then APPENDIX VIL notes on my journey. b y a. sprenger. I n the map to a former edition of the Pilgrimage, Captain Burton's route from Madina to Meccah is wrongly laid down, owing to a typographical error^oi the text, 'From Wady Laymun to Meccah S.E. 45 0 ;' (see vol. ii. p. 155, ante), whereas the road runs S.W. 45 0 , or, as Hamdany expresses himself in the com mentary on the Qa9yda Rod., 'Between west and south; and therefore the setting sun shines at the even ing prayer (your face being turned towards Meccah) on your right temple.' The account of the eastern route from Madina to Meccah by so experienced a traveller as Captain Burton is an important contribu tion to our geographical knowledge of Arabia. It leads over the lower terrace of Nejd, the country which Mus lim writers consider as the home of the genuine Arabs and the scene of Arabic chivalry. As by this mistake the results of my friend's pilgrimage, which, though pious of ^ as he unquestionably is, he did not undertake from pure} religious motives, have been in a great measure marred, I called in 1871 his attention to it. At the same time submitted to him a sketch of a map in which his own and Burckhardt's routes are protracted, and a few notes culled from Arabic geographers, with the intention ot showing how much light his investigations throw on earlyAppendix VII.—Notes on my Journey. 403 geography if illustrated by a corrected map; and how they fail to fulfil this object if the mistake is not cleared up. The enterprising traveller approved of both the notes and the map, and expressed it as his opinion that it might be useful to append them to the new edition. I therefore thought proper to recast them, and to present them herewith to the reader. At Sufayna, Burton found the Baghdad Caravan. The regular Baghdad-Meccah Road, of which we have two itineraries, the one reproduced by Hamd^ny and the other by Ibn Khordadbeh, Qodama, and others, keeps to the left of Sufayna, and runs parallel with the Eastern Madina-Meccah Road to within one stage of Meccah. We find only one passage in Arabic geographers from which we learn that the Baghdadlies, as long as a thou sand years ago, used under certain circumstances to take the way of Sufayna. Yacut, vol. iii. p. 403, says: 'Sufayna (i^ Cufayna), a place in the c Aliya (Highland) within the territory of the Solaymites, lies on the road of Zobayda. The pilgrims make a roundabout, and take this road, if they suffer from want of water. The pass of Sufayna, by which they have to descend, is very difficult.' The ridges over which the road leads are called al-Sitar, and are described by Ykcut, vol. iii. p. 38, as a range of nd hills, flanking Sufayna, with defiles which serve as passes. Burton, vol. ii. p. 128, describes them as low hills of red sandstone and bright porphyry. Zobayda, whose name the partly improved, partly newly opened Hajj-Road from Baghdad to Meccah bore, was the wife of Caliph Harun, and it appears from Burton, pp. 134 and 136, that the improvements made by this spirited woman—as the wells near Ghadir, and the Birkat (Tank) are now ascribed to her weak, fantastical, and con temptible husband. Burton's description of the plain covered with huge boulders and detached rocks (p. 131) puts us in mind of404 Pilgrmage to Al-Madinah and Mcccah. the Felsenmeer in the Odemvald.

The whole Wady is one of the A c radh (oasis like districts) of Madina, and is administered by a Lieutenant of the Governor of that city.

Though we know much less of it than Yac&lt;it, we may safely assert that the cultivation has vanished and the condition has altered. At Zariba ( i-j^, Dhariba) Burton and his party ot rail put on the Ihram (pilgrim-garb). If the Baghdadlies fol- of th [e frot vers t id Ses i at si he tw or si antain ;e, pro (Wad' second )lace c y SayJ re tw regiot lescrif PP ontaic Wadl at (tlx )urse &lt; of tH ages« of the low the regular road they perform this ceremony at Dzat- c Irq, which lies somewhat lower down than Dhariba, to the South-east of it, and therefore the rain-water which falls in Dhariba flows in the shape of a torrent to Dzat- c Irq, and is thence carried off by the Northern Nakhla. Above the station of Dzat- c Irq there rise ridges called c Irq ; up these ridges the regular Baghdad Road ascends to the high-plateau, and they are therefore con sidered by early geographers as the western 1'mit of Nejd. c Omara apud Yacut, vol. iv. p. 746, says: 'All the coun try in which the water flows in an Easterly (North-east erly) direction, beginning from Dzat- c Irq as far as Baby lonia, is called Nejd ; and the country which slopes West wards, from Dzat- c Irq to Tihama (the coast), is called Hijaz.' The remarks of Arabic geographers on the Western watershed, and those of Burton, vol. ii. pp. 142 and 154, illustrate and complete each other most satis factorily. It appears from Yacut that the Fiumara in which Burton's party was attacked by robbers takes its rise at Ghomayr close to Dzat- c Irq, that there were nu merous date-groves in it, and that it falls at Bostan Ibn c Amir into the Nakhla, wherefore it is called the Northern f pari Nakhla. The Southern Nakhla, also called simply )ducii![i Nakhla, a term which is sometimes reserved for the trunk lowe' formed by the junction of the Southern and Northern406 Pilgyinicigt to Al-Madinah and Meccah. Nakhla from Bostan Ibn c Amir downwards, is on account of its history one of the most interesting spots in all Arabia; I therefore make no apology for entering on its geography. In our days it is called Wady Laymun, and Burckhardt, vol. i. p. 158, says of it : 'Zeyme is a half, ruined castle, at the eastern extremity of Wady Lymoun, with copious springs of running water. Wady Lymoui is a fertile valley, which extends for several hours (toward; West) in the direction of Wady Fatme (anciently calld Bafn Marr, or Marr-Tzahran, which is, in fact, a contin uation of Wady Nakhla). It has many date-plantation^ and formerly the ground was cultivated ; but this, I be lieve, has ceased since the Wahabi invasion: its fruit gardens, too, have been ruined. This (he means tht village Laymun, compare Burton, vol. ii. p. 147) is tht last stage of the Eastern-Syrian Hadj route. To the South-east or East-south-east of Wady Lymoun is another fertile valley, called Wady Medyk, where some sherifs are settled, and where Sherif Ghaleb possessed landed property. 1 ' In the commentary on the QagydaRod^ 1 Medyk is Burton's El-Mazik, the spelling in Arabic being jsAi Madhyq. Burckhardt's account leads us to think that the village now called Madhyq, or Wady Laymun, lies on the left bank of the Fiumara, and is identical with Bostan Ibn'Amir, which is de scribed by YScut as situated in the fork between the Northern and Southern Nakhlas, and which in ancient times had, like the village Wady Laymun, the name of the valley of which it was the chief place, viz., Batn Nakhla. Burton gives no information of the P 051 ^ of the village, but he says : '• On the right bank of the Fiumara stood the Meccan Sharif's state pavilion.' Unless the pavilion is separ ated from the village by the Fiumara there is a discrepancy between ♦he two accounts, which leads me to suspect that ' right' is an over sight for ' left.' Anciently was pronounced Nakhlat, and, 1 we suppress the guttural, as the Greeks and Romans sometimes di , Nalat. Strabo, p. 782, in his narrative of the retreat of Aelius Ga us, mentions a place which he calls Malotha, and of which he says 1 stood on the bank of a river—a position which few towns in Ara a have. The context leaves no doubt that he means Batn Isakhla, aria that MalStha is a mistake for Nalotha.Appendix VII.—Notes on my Journey. 4 0 7 Wady Nakhla, as far as the road to Meccah runs through it, is described as follows : From the ridges with whose declivity the Western watershed begins, you descend into Wady Baubat; it is flanked on the left side by the Sarat mountains, on which T^yif stands, and contains Qarn- almanazil (once the capital of the Minaeans, the great trading nation of antiquity). Three or four miles below Qarn is Masjid Ibrahym, and here the valley assumes the name of Wady Nakhla. At no great distance from the Masjid there rise on the left-hand side of the Wady two high peaks called Jebel Yasum and Jebel Kafw. Both were the refuge of numerous monkeys, who used to invade the neighbouring vineyards. As you go down Wady Nakhla the first place of importance you meet isal-Zayma. Close to it was a garden which, during the reign of Moq- tadir, belonged to the Hashimite Prince c Abd Allah, and was in a most flourishing condition. It produced an abundance of henna, plantains, and vegetables of every description, and yielded a revenue of five thousand Dinar- mithqals (about ^2,860) annually. A canal from Wady (the river) Nakhla feeds a fountain which jets forth in the midst of the garden, and lower down a tank. In the gar den stood a fort (which in a dilapidated condition is extant to this day, and spoken of by Burckhardt). It was built of huge stones, guarded for the defence of the pro perty by the BanCi Sa'd, and tenanted by the servants and followers of the proprietor. Below al-Zayma is Sabtaha, a post-station where a relay of horses was kept for the transport of Government Despatches. To give an idea of the distances, I may mention that the post-stages were twelve Arabic miles asunder, which on this road are rather larger than an English geographical mile. The first station from Meccah was Moshash, the second Sabfiha, and the third was at the foot of the hill Y^stim. The author of the commentary from which I derive this information leaves W4dy Nakhla soon after Sabuha, and408 Pilrimagc to Al-Madinah and Meccah. turns his steps towards the holy city. He mentions 'the steep rocky Pass ' up which Burton toiled with difficulty, and calls it Orayk. Though he enters into many details, he takes no notice of the hill-girt plain called Sola. This name occurs however in an Arabic verse, apud Y^cilt, vol ii. p. 968: ' In summer our pasture-grounds are in the country of Nakhla, within the districts of al-Zayma and Sola.' In Wady Fatima, Burckhardt found a perennial riv ulet, coming from the Eastward, about three feet broad and two feet deep. It is certain that Wady Fatima, for- j S p merly called Wady Marr, is a continuation of Wady em ^ Nakhla, and Yactit considers in one passage Nakhla as a or jj subdivision of Marr, and in another Marr as part of Wady or c Nakhla ; but we do not know whether the rivulet, which the at al-Zayma seems to be of considerable size, disappears! v jii £ under the sand in order to come forth again in Wady. had Marr, or whether it forms an uninterrupted stream. In men ancient times the regular Baghdad-Meccah Road did not | an( j run down from Dzat- c Irq by the Northern Nakhla which it s ; Burton followed, but it crossed this Wady near its North- our ern end and struck over to the Southern Nakhla as far ^air as Qarn almarazil, which for a long time was the second p er j station from Meccah, instead of Dzat- c Irq. mon | or g i we I toric 1 Alia Her The One quer sacr sign,s 'the ficulty, ietails, This iit, vol. in the na and APPENDIX VIII. ial riv- the meccah pilgrimage. ■ H aving resolved to perform the Meccah pilgrimage, la, for- J S p ent a f ew months at Cairo, and on the 22nd of May Wadyj embarked in a small steamer at Suez with the ' mahmil ' la as al or an ^ jj-g military escort, conveying the ' kiswah '* Wadyl or covering for the 'kabah.' On the 25th the man at whichj ^0 w heel informed us that we were about to pass the ppears village of Rabikh, on the Arabian coast, and that the time Wady had consequently arrived for changing our usual habili- T 1 - ments for the 'ihram,' or pilgrim-costume of two towels, did not an( j fo r taking the various interdictory vows involved in which its assumption : such as not to tie knots in any portion of North- our dress, not to oil the body, and not to cut our nails or l as ar hair, nor to improve the tints of the latter with the cop- second p er y re( i of henna. Transgression of these and other cere monial enactments is expiated either by animal sacrifice, or gifts of fruit or cereals to the poor. After a complete ablution and assuming the ihram, we performed two prayer-flections, and recited the meri torious sentences beginning with the words ' Labbaik Allah huma labbaik !' ' Here I am, O God, here I am ! Here I am, O Unassociated One, here I am, for unto Ihee belong praise, grace, and empire, O Unassociated i One !' This prayer was repeated so often, people not unfre- jquently rushing up to their friends and shrieking the i sacred sentence into their ears, that at last it became a signal for merriment rather than an indication of piety.410 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. On the 26th we reached Jeddah, where the utter bet sterility of Arabia, with its dunes and rocky hills, becomes of 1 apparent. The town, however, viewed from the sea, is one not unpicturesque. Many European vessels were at anchoi off the coast ; and as we entered the port, innumerablf small fishing-boats darting in all directions, their sails nd ha-y longer white, but emerald green from the intense lustre 0 div the water, crowded around us on all sides, and remindei one by their dazzling colours and rapidity of motion ofthi shoals of porpoises so often seen on a voyage round tin Cape. On disembarking we were accosted by severa ' mutawwafs,' or circuit-men, so termed in Arabic because, besides serving as religious guides in general their special duty is to lead the pilgrim in his sevei obligatory circuits around the Kabah. We encampec outside the town, and, having visited the tomb of 'oui Mother Eve,' mounted our camels for Meccah. After a journey of twenty hours across the Desert we passed the barriers which mark the outermost limits 0: the sacred city, and, ascending some giant steps, pitchec our tents on a plain, or rather plateau, surrounded bj barren rock, some of which, distant but a few yards, masl from view the birthplace of the Prophet. It was midnight; a few drops of rain were falling, and lightning playec around us. Day after day we had watched its brightness from the sea, and many a faithful haji had pointed out tc his companions those fires which were Heaven's witness to the sanctity of the spot. ' A1 hamdu Lillah! Thanks be to God ! we were now at length to gaze upoc the ' Kiblah,' to which every Mussulman has turned it prayer since the days of Muhammad, and which for long ages before the birth of Christianity was reverenced by the wa Patriarchs of the East. Soon after dawn arose from out gre midst the shout of ' Labbaik ! Labbaik ! ' and passing thrAppendix VIII.—The Meccah Pilgrimage. 411 between the rocks, we found ourselves in the main street of Meccah, and approached the' Gateway of Salvation,' one of the thirty-nine portals of the Temple of Al-Haram. On crossing the threshold we entered a vast unroofed quadrangle, a mighty amplification of the Palais Royal, having on each of its four sides a broad colonnade, divided into three aisles by a multitude of slender columns, and rising to the height of about thirty feet. Surmounting each arch of the colonnade is a small dome : in all there are a hundred and twenty, and at different points arise seven minarets, dating from various epochs, and of some what varying altitudes and architecture. The numerous pigeons which have their home within the temple have been believed never to alight upon any portion of its roof, thus miraculously testifying to the holiness of the building. This marvel having, however, of late years been suspended, many discern another omen of the approach of the long- predicted period when unbelievers shall desecrate the hal lowed soil. In the centre of the square area rises the far-famed Kabah, the funereal shade of which contrasts vividly with the sunlit walls and precipices of the town. It is a cubical structure of massive stone, the upper two-thirds of which are mantled by a black cloth embroidered with silver, and the lower portion hung with white linen. At a distance of several yards it is surrounded by a balustrade provided with lamps, which are lighted in the evening, and the space thus enclosed is the circuit-ground along which, day and night, crowds of pilgrims, performing the circular ceremony of Tawaf, realize the idea of perpetual motion. We at once advanced to the black stone imbedded in an angle of the Kabah, kissed it, and exclaimed, ' Bismillah wa Allahu Akbar,'—' In God's name, and God is greatest.' Then we commenced the usual seven rounds, three at a walking pace, and four at a brisk trot. Next412 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah. followed two prayer-flections at the tomb of Abraham, after which we drank of the water of Zamzam, said to be the same which quenched the thirst of Hagar's exhausted son. Besides the Kabah, eight minor structures adorn the quadrangle, the well of Zamzam, the library, the clock- room, the triangular staircase, and four ornamental resting- places for the orthodox sects of Hanafi, Shaft, Maliki.and Hanbali. We terminated our morning duties by walking and running seven times along the streets of Safa and Marwa, so named from the flight of seven steps at each of its extremities. After a few days spent in visiting various places ol interest, such as the slave-market and forts, and the houses of the Prophet and the Caliphs 'Ali and Abubakr, we started on our six hours'journey to the mountain of 'Arifat, an hour's sojourn at which, even in a state oi insensibility, confers the rank of haji. It is a mountain spur of about a hundred and fifty feet in height, presenting an artificial appearance from the wall encircling it and the terrace on its slope, from which the iman delivers a sermon before the departure of his congregation for Meccah. His auditors were, indeed, numerous, their tents being scattered over two or three miles of the country A great number of their inmates were fellow-subjects of ours from India. I surprised some of my Meccah friends by informing them that Queen Victoria numbers nearly twenty millions of Mohammedans among her subjects. On the 5th of June, at sunset, commencing our return, we slept at the village of Muzdalifah, and there gathered and washed seven pebbles of the size of peas, to be flung at three piles of whitewashed masonry known as the Shaitans (Satans) of Muna. We acquitted ourselves satisfactorily of this duty on the festival of the 6tb ofAppendix VIII.—The Meccah Pilgrimage. 413 June, the 10th day of the Arabian month Zu'lhijah. Each of us then sacrificed a sheep, had his hair and nails cut, exchanged the ihram for his best apparel, and, embracing his friends, paid them the compliments of the season. The two following days the Great, the Middle, and the Little Satan were again pelted, and, bequeathing to the unfortunate inhabitants of Muna the unburied and odorous remains of nearly a hundred thousand animals, we returned, eighty thousand strong, to Meccah. A week later, having helped to insult the tumulus of stones which marks, according to popular belief, the burial-place of Abulahab, the unbeliever, who, we learn from the Koran, has descended into hell with his wife, gatherer of sticks, I was not sorry to relinquish a shade temperature of 120°, and wend my way to Jeddah en route for England, after delegating to my brethren the recital of a prayer in my behalf at the Tomb of the Prophet at Medina. In penning these lines I am anxious to encourage other Englishmen, especially those from India, to perform the pilgrimage, without being deterred by exaggerated reports concerning the perils of the enterprise. It must, however, be understood that it is absolutely indispensable to be a Mussulman (at least externally) and to have an Arabic name. Neither the Koran nor the Sultan enjoins the killing of intrusive Jews or Christians ; nevertheless, two years ago, an incognito Jew, who refused to repeat the creed, was crucified by the Meccah populace, and in in the event of a pilgrim again declaring himself to be an unbeliever the authorities would be almost powerless to protect his life. An Englishman who is sufficiently conversant with the prayers, formulas, and customs of the Mussulmans, and possess a sufficient guarantee of orthodoxy, need, however, apprehend no danger if he applies through the British Consulate at Cairo for an introduction to the Amirul Haj, the Prince of the Caravan.416 Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah.

Commander Robinson, whose able work, 'The British Fleet,' was reviewed in these columns in November, 1894, has now undertaken the editing of a series of handbooks, each of which will deal with one particular subject connected with that great creation, the Royal Wavy. Our national literature has certainly lacked much in this respect. Such books as nave heretofore been produced have almost invariably been of a character too scientific and technical to be of much use to the general public. The series now being issued is intended to obviate this defect, and when completed will form a description, both historical and actual, of the Koyal .Navy, which will not only be of use to the professional student, but also be of interest to all who are concerned in the maintenance and efficiency of the Na.vy.'—Broad Arrow. The series of naval handbooks edited by Commander Robinson has made a most hopeful peginnmg, and may be counted upon to supply the growing popular demand for information in regard to the Navy, on which the national existence depends.'— Times. Messrs. Be'l s series of 'Royal Navy Handbooks' promises to be a very successful en erpnse. They are practical and definitely informative, and, though meant for the use of persons closely acquainted with their subjects, they are not so discouraginely technical as to be useless to the lay seeker after knowledge.'— BookmanA Classified Catalogue of Selected Works. 35 BELL'S CATHEDRAL SERIES. jllustratcD /iRouoarapbs in Ibau&amp;B S(3e. edited by GLEESON WHITE AND E.

THE inauguration of this series of copyright works was the first attempt on the part of English publishers to provide good literature at a low price. It was commenced in 1847 by Mr. H. G. Bohn with the issue of his Standard Library , which consisted of reprints and translations of the classical literature of England, Germany, France, and Italy. The success which attended this was so great that Mr. Bohn was encouraged to extend the field, and he started the various 'Libraries' known as The Scientific, The Illustrated, The Classical, The Antiquarian, &amp;c . In every case the works were admirably printed on good paper, and furnished with illustrations, portraits, and maps of the highest quality. So important an influence has this series obtained in the advancement of English education, that there is hardly a library, public or private, the nucleus of which is not founded in ' Bohn.' THOMAS CARLYLE said of it: '/ may say, in regard to all manner of books, Bohn's Publication Series is the usefullest thing I knowj' and his friend EMERSON recognised its admirable purpose when he said: ' The translations of Bohn's Library have done for literature what railroads have done for internal intercourse} In 1864 Messrs. Bell &amp; Sons acquired the series, and from time to time added new works, until to-day it includes over 77° volumes in all departments of literature, art, and science. With the progress of scholarship and research, Messrs. Bell &amp; Sons have found that new editions and new translations were necessary, and these they have initiated, with the result that Bohn's Libraries are unrivalled for accuracy of text. As for the editorial work, the chief literary organ of America—the New York CRITIC—considers ''the Impnnt oj Bohn's Standard Library is a guaranty of %ood editing? Within late years the publishers have so far improved the paper, printing, and binding, that the volumes form handsome as well as essential additions to every library.' An imponant body of cheap literature, for which every living worker in this country who draws strength from the past has reason to be grateful,' Professor Henry Morlet. ' Messrs. Bell &amp; Sons are still energetically pursuing their task of adding to and improving the famous series of Bohn's Libraries, which Thomas Carlyle pro nounced to be 'the usefullest thing I know,' and are . . . constantly adding to the Libraries, in the new and certainly pleasanter form, reprints of Standard Works which no gentleman's library should be without.'—Mr. Frederic Harrison in the Daily Chronicle.

' This new and attractive form in which the volumes of Bohn's Standard Library are being issued is not meant to hide either indifference in the selection of books included in this well-known series, or carelessness in the editing.' Si. Jameis Gaxette. ' Messrs. Bell &amp; Sons are making constant additions of an eminently acceptable character to 'Bohn's Libraries.''— AthencBum, The seven hundred and forty-eight volumes of which the set consists form a collection of literature which, for general usefulness and convenience, is quite unequalled ; and in their new form this convenience is decidedly increased.'
