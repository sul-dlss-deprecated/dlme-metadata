Dated 31st Deceinber 1927 received 1st January 1928. Following is opinion regarding situation of affairs in desert country. Dawish is acting contrary to Ibn Saud's wishes and the latter is just as anxious for peace on the 'border at the present time as we are. He is in a very difficult position however as he is hated in Hejaz and has enemies in Hejd even among his own family (his brother and nephew were almost certainly at the 'bottom of the plot to murder his son and I'bn Jilawi last sommer), and the people whom he has to rely on most to keep him on his throne are the Ikhwan tribes. Consequently, although he is extremely annoyed with them,he will not dare to try to punish the Mutair, particularly in view of the oath taken by Dawish, Sultan bin Humaid, Ibn Hithlain in 1926 mutually to support each other in such a case On the other hand it is probable he will re-establish his % authority by persuasion and peaceful means and will then be in a position to keep tribes quiet, at any rate for some time. would be This is what is hoped will happen as anything better than the appalling chaos which would follow revolution in Hejd even if it did remove ban on trade with Kuwait. which Dawish has up to the present enjoyed are having a very prejudicial effect on our prestige in Arabia (Irak Government hAs no prestige and is looked on as a negligible quantity). It is argued our areopianes cannot protect the frontier or not understood i our reason for not retaliating and punishing Mutair by bombing them or their villages is that we cannot ? Meanwhile recent events and success in raid harm raiders. Our respect for treaties and frontiers is oror date not. Were we to take such a course and go right into Nejd to punish them I'bn Saud might possibly protest hut really he would 'be very pleased. Unless our aircraft have good raffffpirfcTitigj-ty fortune to get an opportunity to teach them a severe lesson soon, not only will all desert tribes inevit- -ably 'become Akhwan soon hut the movement would probably spread to the Jezireh. Such is opinion here among intelligent people. POLITICAL.Telegram From To Bio* V/ Code Political, Bahrain# Resident, Busiiire.

In arguing against post at Busaiyah he is more than probably merely voicing frontier tribal opinion not because IT he wants to but because he has to do so and his statement that this post and others projected have caused excitement amongst frontier tribes is correct. My own information corroborates Political Agent, Kuwait, that Ibn Saud would not be sorry to see Faisal al Dawish disappear but he cannot take action to this effect himself. I have today received telegram from Bahrain say- 1 -ing letter has come from Ibn Saud in answer to my letter sent under sanction of your telegram 438, dated 9th December,saying that he is detained by pressure of work at Riadh but hopes to meet me later. I think there is little doubt that he is postponing meeting until situation clears and until he has taken such steps as he can.

Whole question has now 'been further considered. H.M's. Government are convinced that Whatever may be the personal attitude of Ibn Saud towards raids, as to which results of Haworth's conversation with Ibn Saud must be awaited, it is essential that early steps should be taken to make raiders understand that further aggression on their part willnot be tolerated. In view of the difficulty of catching raiders red-handed, which would clearly be best and most effective method, only practicable course appears to be to attack their headquarters from the air. Selection of particular villages etc. most suited for such attack must be left to your decision in consultation with Air Officer Commanding. Air Ministry suggest following objectives as possibly suitable for purpose HAFAR AL BAT IN, JARIYAH AL ILYAH, JARIYAH AS SIFLAH. Would no doubt consider what advanced bases it would be necessary to establish in order to facilitate attack. Question of bombing main tribal headquarters at ARTAWIYAH has also been raided but the place could presumab ~ly be reached only bases in Kuwait and political objections to using Kuwait territory for such a purpose are obvious. I shall be glad to have your views on this point. You should send immediate message to Ibn Saud infoiming him of latest raid and stating that we regard it as 'ScuJ. absolutely u/.

It should 'be made cleaoir to him that our action will take the form of bombing villages | of guilty tribes. After a lapse of a reasonable interval, during which warnings would be dropped, punitive action would be taken accordingly. Every care should be ex/ercised that no action is taken against any place which has been occupied by Ibn Saud^ regular troops or where his authority has been re-established. As to this you will no doubt confirm rumour mentioned in your telegram Ho • 622 that ARTAWIYAH has been occupied by Ibn Saud's forces.

Political Agent, Kuwait, } Dated 4th received 5th January 1928. / ^' Your telegram ITo. 1. Question of attacking tribal headquarters has been discussed with Mesopotamian Ministers and Air Officer Commanding. Unanimous opinion is that such attacks are impracticable. Except at Artawiyah, which is too remote, 'buildings are not known to exist - other places are merely wells or small oases where tents are pitches and occupants would presumably scatter on receipt of warming and render subsequent useful operations impossible. Existing maps are very inaccurate and there is no British officer in Mesopotamia with sufficient local knowledge to insure machines reaching their objectives. Whatever operations are undertaken they must fulfill two equally important aims (i) to put immediate stop to raids (ii) to punish Mutair as severely as possible. These objectives can, in my opinion and that of the Air Officer Commanding, be obtained by exercising air control oyer as large an area of Hejd territory as possible. Two air bases under armoured car protection will therefore be established immediately. Bases will be well within Mesopotamian frontier at first but v/ill be graduallyaosxBX moved as far south as consideration of supplies, etc. renders practicible, being finally located if possible at both ends Ox neutral zone. Earning will be dropped on parties camped or grazing in territory where Mutair usually graze, telling them to retire four days march south of frontier, if they do not do so they will be attacked. Moving bodies unaccompanied2V T q] unaccompanied 'by flocks and herds can only be raiders and will 'be attacked .whenever met without warning. There is no danger that Ihn Saud T s forces willoe in area controlled. I These measures will, in our opinion, 'be the 'best method of (i) checking frontier raids (ii) inflicting punishment on Mutair (iii) proving to Akhwan that if they can prevent Mesopotamian tribes from grazing peacefully in Mesopotamia we are equally capable of preventing them from grazing peace- -fully in their usual pastures (iv) forcing Mutair to submit to Ibn Saud. These measures will make it impossible to meet Anezeh Chief's request for presence of aeroplanes and cars with his tribe but they should effectively reassure Anezeh. It is also intended with immediate object of reassuring Mesop -otamian tribes,and probably as permanent measure, to estab- -lish small posts equipped with Lewis guns and wireless at Salman and Sha^fbichah. Bedouin opion is strong that bckocade of Hasa ports is best weapon against Akhwan. It v/ould not however be as rapid and effective as attacks on Mutair and is open to objection that it would appear to be directed against Ibn Saud himself and not only against his rebellious tribes. I am however still of opinion that this measure should be adopted if those proposed in this telegram do not prove effective. Latest news from Nejd very conflicting but indicates that Ibn Saud*3 measures against Dawish have been checked by threatening attitude of Ataiba tribe. If latter combine with Mutair expert opinion holds that Ibn Saud will be powerless to reduce them by force. Adoption of measures indicated above will necessitaoe amendment of message outlined in your telegram -' 0 * Presume you will instruct Bushire accordingly.

In reply to a request from Ibn Sa^ud that more effective measures should be taken by the ''Iraq Government to prevent raid- ing, the High Commissioner informed him through the British Consul, Jiddah, of the measures taken to this end and also sent a list of the Shammar tribes believed to be in Syria. The High Commis sioner added that while the ^Iraq Government could not accept responsibility for raids carried out by such tribes against Najd, they would do their best to prevent raiding parties from crossing 'Iraq territory.Summary of correspondence with Jbn Sa\ul etc. contd.

No further reply was sent to Ibu Sa'ud by Commissioner. In November Ibn Sa'ud wrote a further letter to the British Consul drawing attention to the importance of checking raids from 'Iraq and emphasising the fact that though the raiders may have^ come from Syria, none the less they had to pass through 'Iraq territory and consequently the Iraq Govern ment must I ear the responsibility. He urged that this matter should be settled at the earliest date possible. No reply was sent to this letter.. The Secretary of State commenting on Ibn Sa/ud's letter (see 2) considered th*t some responsibiiity rested on 'Iraq in respect of raiding parties traversing the 'Iraq corridor and asked for pro posals for preventing such raids.

It was the building o£ this post which enraged Faisal al Dawish and the Akhwan, In September 1927,. Ibn Sa'ud addressed to 'the High C* mmtssioner a protest against tbe building of barracks and forts at Busaiyah on the ground that it constituted an infringement of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol, (This letter war written before the receipt of the- High Commissioner's letter referred to under No. 8.)

High Commissioner's tele gram No. 480, dated 12th October, 1927. 11 The Colonial Office, after 16 days'delay, telegraphed that Jiddah has been authorised to communicate reply to Ibn Sa'ud ; suggested that the message should also be sent through Bushire, as Ibn Sa'ud was reported to have left for Hasa. Secretary of State's tele gram No. 385, dated 28th October, 1927. 12 This was &lt;3oue ; (though it turned out that Ibn Sa'ud was still at Riyadh). Note. —An acknowledgment of this message was received by Consul Jiddah from the Hizaj Ministry of Foreign Affairs who disputed the location of Busaiyah. No acknowledgment however was received from Ibn Sa'ud until the middle of December when the Poli tical Eesident in the Pursian Gulf received two letters from Ibn Sa'ud of which copies have not yet reached the High Commission wide telegram No. T.-114 dated 15th December, 1927, from Politi cal Eesident to Secretary of State\ High Commissioner's tele- giam No. 572, dated 29th October, 1927. 13 In the meantime a further letter was received from Ibn Sa'ud acknowledging receipt of the High Com- nrssioner's letter of August 17th (See No. 8) point ing out that the High Commissioner had taken nearly a year to answer his letter and that erection of a frontier ' posts by the 'Iraq Government, even though intended to check raiding into Najd, were contrary to the Uqair Protocol. He must therefore insist on the removal of these fortifications which were causicg alarm and commotion among his tribe?. IS ate. —This letter was referred to the 'Iraq Government and it was proposed to supply Ibn Sa'ud with detailed informalion of the position and strength of the posts. The 'Iraq Government agreed and supplied tlie information, but the attack on Busaiyah intervened and the letter was not sent. Ibn Sa'ud's letter No. 273, dated 2 J st September, 1927. 14 On November 5th, the day of the Busaiyah attack, Ibn Sa'ud wrote to the High Commissioner that on arrival at Riyadh he found that the tribes were filled with resentment on account of the military activities of the ' Iraq Government ; he added that the tribes were on the ' Iraq frontier far from Headquarters and he could not guarantee the safety of the frontier unless the frontier forts were dis mantled. In a second letter written on the same day he referred to the resentment aroused among the tribes by the flights of British aeroplanes over their territory and the visits of cars to the frontier and neutral zone. Ibn Sa'ud's letter No.2/3 and No. 3/1003, dated 5th November 1927. 15 On November 7th, Ibn Sa'ud wrote a further letter to the High Commissioner stating that information had just reached him that certain desert tribes had actually gone out to oppose the construction of the Busaiyah Post. He had sent forces in pursuit to stop them and to effect their arrest and punishment if the report proved true. He again urged the immediate demolition of the Post.

On November Mthj the Secretary of State instructed the Political Resident, Bushire, to transmit a message to Ibn Sa'ud protesting against the attack on the Busaiyah Post and asking that the offenders should be punished, compensation paid for killed and wounded and measures taken to prevent further raids ; Kuwait Conference also to be postponed. On 8th December, 1927, a telegram was received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, saying that Shaikh Hafidh (Ibn Sa'ud^s representative, who had been sent to Kuwait to attend the conference) bad been instructed by Ibn Sa-'ud to warn the High Com missioner that serious trouble had broken out in Nejd and that a force was marching north contrary to 'his orders. The Secretary of State authorised the Political .Resident, Bushire, to despatch to Ibn Sa^ud a message aeknowleding the warning referred to in para. 16 and informing him of the conflict between British aeroplanes and an Akhwan force in the neutral zone on December 9th'and adding; that as a temporary expedient and until Ibn Sa^ud control of the frontier areas, would pursue Akhwan raiding Nejd frontier where necessary and salutary lesson. had re established British aeroplanes parties across the to inflict a lasting On November 30th Ibn Sa^ud wrote to the Political Resident, Bu o hire, referring to past correspondence between himself and the High Commissioner claim ing that his protests against raids from J Iraq had been ignored and then answered by the crea tion of frontier posts in defiance of the Uqair Protocol.

I am in receipt of Yovir Excellency's letter No. 1J743 dated the 7th November 19-7, in sirhich you convey to me the 'Iraq Government's demand that I should prove that the Dahamishah, iacludiag Muhaaaad bin Mijlad, .were Najd subjects at the time of the signature of the 'Uqair Protocol. I am surprised at this demand, as I should not have thought it necessary to prove what is as clear as the noonday sun. I do not wish to produce the proof myself, but rather to refer the 'Iraq Government to the tribes of 'Iraq, and to refer the 'Iraq Government and the Office of the High Oommis- sioner for 'Iraq to the files of old communications about the Dahamishah. Have the Dahamishah ever come in to the 'Iraq Government, or been subject to thers from the time of the establishment of the 'Iraq Government up to the present moment? I am convinced that if reference oe made to the aote on the discussion about the Dahamishah #hich tooK place between Sir Percy Cox and me in the presence of the delegate of 'Iraq % and Pahd al-Hadhdhal ample proof will be found that the D.ahamishah are Najd subjects. That was the object of Article I of the Second Protocol other than to be an acknow- ledgment on the part of 'Iraq that the Dahamishah n h d become Najd subjects in that they had not been in 'Iraq but had come to us from Syria. As a matter of fact the Dahamishah migrated to us and became naturalised many years ago, since when they have obeyed our orders and laws, and have not been subject to the 'Iraq Government for a single day. Again, there can be no question that the Treaty of Muhammarah was not ratified by ooth parties, and v?aa replaced by the 'Uqair Protocol. With regard to what you say about the attack naving taken place within the boundaries of 'Iraq, According to theiaformatlon which I received it 4id not taite place urithin the boundaries of 'Iraq, but I have ordered fresh inquiries to be made, ou ask aie in your letter to have the plunder taken by Ibn Mijlad from the Surpir returned. I agree to this, and it was only for his attaok: on the Suqur that I have punlsh©d Ion fljlad^and have ordered the plunder taken from the Suaur re&amp;rnecC to be.I have now caused inquiries to be made as to whether this has been actually done, and if so I shall inform you to whom it was given. If it has not yet been restored, I aai prepared to do so. On the other hand it appears from His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq's letter No,6.^2 dated the IQth June 1927 that the Saqur raided Ibn Mijlld in my territory and drove off about fifty camels, the restitution of which I now demand, I wish the 'Iraq Government to know that I only punished Ibn MlJlad in order to keep my promise to them, and I ask to be similarly met by the 'Iraq Government as regards the fulfilment of promises. Regarding your statement that the 'Iraq Government justifies the action of the ^utasarrif of Dfwanfyah in summoning Kuhammad at-Turki bin liijlad and Jazza' bin lad, becauae they are Dahauishah, and the Dahamishah belong to to the 'Amarat, who are 'Iraq subjects. This, in my opinion ia not supported by proof or evidence. Is there anyone of the tribal leaders who will ^ive evidence to this effect^ I accordingly protest against the 'Iraq Governiaent * s ^laisi tnat the -Dahamisha|i are their subjects, and repeat my protest against the action of the Mutasarrif of Dfwaniyah in communicating with my subjects without my knowledge, and I demand that the agreements between me and 'Iraq be respected so that our friendly relations may continue.

We feel pleased and happy for their appointing the Hon'ble Colonel Haworth the Political Resident in the Persin Gulf to discuss with us and try to clear up the misuiiderstanding which, has arisen in this case.

The situation in Najd after the recent actiontr; of the Iraq Government has changed a gxeat deal and it does not allow us to do all that we ' sjtfl tfa want and desire® We will give the reason^ here which want to be conveyed to the Hon'ble the Political Resident for the information of Kis Majesty's Government so that when a meeting takes place between us and }lis Honour he will be in possession of all the necessary Instructions in this matter and their details. W&amp; do not want to conceal it from you that there is i no man, woman or child in Kajd who was not very much disappointed owing to the building of Bi^saiyah^forV bj' the Iraq Government* And t 'e next disappointment i that followed it was due to two actions of the Iraq Government. First they (Iraq) welcomed the criminals whom we wanted to punfeih on account of,Iraq Government A as they have done in the past in the case of Yusuf as- Sadun and his Najdi followers and as they did recently in the case of Bin Mijlad when we puafcehed him on account of the Iraq. He ran away to them and they gave him a shelter and offered him help. Secondly the coming qd of the Iraq officials^and their mixing with our tribes and asking them to run away from our country^and instigat -ing them to cause trouble in our country. For this reason the Najd people felt it very much. When we want ti send them to punish the Dawish they say M we do not(3) fioo) -o - (mmaaj-z-'jc disobey your orders but th? Iraqis ar© the people who ^ contravened the agreement* ' Secondly if we were to punish the-Dawish he would run away to Iraq and there * the Iraq people would shelter him, then what have we done? This ithe situation at Hajd about those who are at XXHXK AL HADUD. Tlierefore there are three ways to settle this dispute and we then accept any responsiblity which may arise should the Iraq Government carry them out regulary.. First article three of the protocal should be observed and the Busaiyah fort t-e-be pulldown with • others, secondly both parties undertake not to accept any criminal coming}' from the country of the other party whatever his crime may be« Third the Iraq Government should undertake to prevent the visit of any motor car aeroplane or man from mixing with our tribes with^intent -ion of creating trouble and we undertake to observe the same. If any agreement is arrived at on these three articles the situation will be quite claar and every thing will bo settled. We 7;ould also be able to punish the big and small in our country and recover all that they have plundered and make them pay for it and punish them for all that they have done* This is r statement we have put up before the &amp; h dtjcc British Government as 'ppomcte for^he coming meeting* Should this be ag^reed upon I hope by the will of God it will remove all the trouble.

POLITICAIie140 Sa'ud is and where lie is likely to remain, in six days. I said that although we were very anxious not to embarrass Ibn Sa'ud we had at the same time a clear duty to the 'Iraq Government and must take immediate steps to stop the Mutair raiding and reassure the 'Iraq tribes. He said he quite realised this and thought that the action we proposed taking might be effective in punishing the Mutair and in preventing them from raiding; although he pointed out that the Mutair are in a state of exalted religious fanaticism and have no fear whatever of death. At the same time he felt sure that it would do great harm to Ibn Sa'ud, as all of his tribes would be angry with him and would accuse him of calling in 'infidels' to help him against 'true believers.' He went on to say that one reason which operated to deter Ihn Sa'ud from suppressing Faisal al Dawish by force was his fear that Dawish might flee to 'Iraq, that his 'dakhala' might be accepted by the 'Iraq Gov ernment, and that he would then become a source of friction in the same way as the refugee Shammar had been in the past. I pointed out that it was scarcely likely that Dawish would try to take refuge in 'Iraq when the Air Force were undertaking active operations against him. I asked him how fai lle thought Ibn Sa'ud was really able to suppress the Mutair. He said that according to his information Ibn Sa'ud was holding a meeting of the reli gious leaders at Riyadh in order to obtain from them a fatwa to the effect that Faisal al Dawish had offended against the Shara' by rebelling against the State, and that he would then be able to declare a 'Jehad' against him I asked him whether he thought that the Akhwan tribes would obey such a fatwa. He said that the Harb would undoubtedly do so. As regards the 'Ataibah, Sultan Ibn Humaid was personally not^ on good terms with Dawish; he had, however, egged him on to his present insubordination and intended to join him if he was thoroughly successful. He would not how ever, be really sorry if Dawish was crushed by Ibn Sa'ud and would, in that event^ submit to Ibn Sa'ud. He said that Dawish himself was a religious fanatic and that his followers were either religious fanatics like himself or scoundrels who were merely out for loot. He said that Ibn Sa'ud was thoroughly sick of the Akhwan who were opposing all his attempts at pro gress Ibn Sa ud wished to connect up all his headquarters by wireless, which would not only be a more efficient but a much better means of communication tnan the present method, but that he was prevented from doinf so by the Akhwan. I ^then handed him a copy of the notice which it is proposed to drop in Najd territory; his only comment was that it should be printed in good large types. • Turning to the question of the Busaiyah post, he asked me whether it would not be possible to abandon it. I said that not only was this entirely out of the question but that other posts would probably be established in tnture. He then said that no good could possibly come of the continuance of the present discussion of the wrongs or the rights of the case. We would go on insisting that Busaiyah was not 'ala atraf al hudud.' while Ibn Sa'ud- would go on insisting that it was without entering into any reasonable ex planation for his contention. It was quite clear to any intelligent man that ala atraf al hudud could only mean within four or five miles of the frontier, and he did not personally believe that Ibn Sa'ud really thought that there had been any contravention of the Ojair Protocol. At the same time, the tribes were m astate of intense indignation on account of the establishment of this post and Ibn Sa ud was compelled to voice public opinion in the matter. He suggested (and the suggestion seems to me a very good one) that recourse should be had to arbitration. There could, he imagined, be only one result of such arbitration but Ibn Sa'ud's face would be saved. He r 0 -1' U i 'n 6 Sa Jr 0 ' 1 have stated m y point of view and the British Government have stated theirs. The case has been referred to an impartial nidge and we must abide by his decision.' He thought it would be better for the suggestion for arbitration to come from Ibn Sa'ud himself Vrli ,should wnte to Ibn Sa'ud proposing this solution without Ion. Sa ud knowing that he had discussed it with us141 He mentioned to me incidentally that he had received a fortnight ago a letter, which he promised to show me, from Ibn Sa'ud to Lord Lloyd. Ihe letter, after dealing with matters with which Lord Lloyd was concerned, went on to make three complaints connected with 'Iraq: (i) that the High Commissioner had not answered his letters, (ii) that the Busaiyah post was a contravention of the Ojair Protocol, and (iii) that he had certain informa tion that both Faisal and Abdullah were stirring up Ibn Sa'ud's tribes against him. He said that he had not forwarded this letter and had written to Tbn Sa ud explaining his reasons for withholding it. These reasons were,, that the letter contained a complaint against the 'Iraq Government and against His Britannic Majesty's Government's representative there. It should therefore have been addressed to either to H. E. or to the British Government direct and not to their representative in Egypt who had nothing whatever to do with 'Iraq affairs. » He also told me that just before leaving Kuwait he had received a letter from Ibn Sa'ud in which the latter stated that he had asked the British Gov ernment to send a delegate to him to discuss he difficulties between 'Iraq and Najd. The letter to him did not state what meeting place had been suggest ed. I said that the British Government had not, so far as I knew, yet re ceived any such communication from Ibn Sa'ud, but thought it possible that this fact might be explained by the message having been sent from Hijaz. We also discussed the nationality question about which I shall note separately. Enclo. No. 2. Note on conversation between the High Commissioner and Shaikh Hafidh Wahha on the 7th of January, 1928, in the presence of Captmn Holt. 1. I said that my Counsellor had communicated to me the gist of his conversation with the Shaikh on the previous day, on which I had been prevented from seeing him by illness. But I should like to hear again from him personally what were the complaints of Ibn Sa'ud against 'Iraq. The Shaikh then read out to me portions of the letter from Ibn Sa'ud to Lord Lloyd a,nd of a letter from Ibn Sa'ud to the Shaikh himself. The letter appeared to deal mainly with what is now ancient history but encouragement given some two years ago by King Faisal to some of the Mutair who had taken refuge in 'Iraq and had subsequently raided into Najd. Therd was mention of the intrigues of 'the two brothers' by which expression, the Shaikh said, King Faisal and the Amir 'Abdullah were meant 2. I replied that it was useless to deny that His Majesty King Faisal was for for family and historical reasons not personally friendly .to Ibn ba ud. . He could not be expected to be so; and it was true, I said that two years ago there had been some encouragement to petty refugees'from Najd on the part of the Palace. But that was all long over The Shammar refugees who came originally from Hail had been for a long time strictly restrained and the Mutair refugees had been driven north with such ' d h ' 1 - 3 The Shaikh replied that this might be so; but'the real diffindtv lay m the refusal of 'Iraq to extradite Najd criminals taking ref^ Iraq. It was true that there were no regular Courts in Naid but justice administered was of the kind suitabk to the deser tribes and h^l was no valid excuse for refusing extradition Moreover ttere wnff^ question of political offenders. In a country like Naid it was imnoLw! o separate political offences from ordinary criminal offences.142 4 I pointed out that there had been no refusal in principle on the part of 'Iraq to conclude an extradition agreement to deal with ordinary criminals. In Article 10 of the Bahra Agreement it had been specifically provided that discussions with this object should be initiated within one year, i.e., before the 1st November, 1926. Unfortunately first of all Ibn Sa'ud had said that he was too busy to arrange a conference with 'Iraq and later when a, conference was arranged circumstances had prevented its taking place. I thought that now, as soon as the difficulties caused by the Mutair raids had passed, the negotiations for an extradition agreement should certainly take place. But I warned him that there could be no yielding on the point of political offenders. To refuse the extradition of political offenders was a universal custom, both in Europe among the most advanced nations and in Asia among the most backward, and Ibn' Sa'ud could not expect an exception to be made for him. 5. We then turned to the question of the recent Mutair raids. The Shaikh repeated what he had said to the Counsellor. I assured him that the fast thought of His Britannic Majesty's Government, or of myself as their representative, or even of the 'Iraq Government (who were not influenced _by the personal feelings of King Faisal) was to weaken Ibn ba ud. We recognised that without him Arabia would fall into anarchy and that it was far better for 'Iraq that there should be a strong consoli dated Government on her borders. But we could not sit still and do nothing under the constant attacks from the Mutair and, as Ibn Sa'ud had told us that they were out of his control, nothing was left for us but to try to i estrain them ourselves by punitive measures. If they were weakened bv our measures, it would be so much [the easier for Ibn Sa'ud to regain sT : nH tw • J;, ?, ?ge n 111111 t0 C0nvey an assurallc e from me to Ibn ud tllat we wished his Government to be strong and effective. . .. 6 ' 1 ^ en asked th e Shaikh what was the real objection of the Akhwan tnbes to the posts at Busaiyah and elsewhere, which I explained were for he purpose of getting rapid information in the desert and enabling us to be ready to stop either raids from tribes in Syria into Nafd across the Iiaq corridor (and this, I said, had been their original obiect) or rairlq from Najd into 'Iraq. He said that a stronP- rumour had hi™ J k ! among the Akhwan tribes that the posts were oX a Drellmi^l . railway and that they believed that Thn hn i P r ^ 1 ? niIiar y to a agreement with the British Gov rnment to bu d a ra'WfC R T/1 to Hail and onwards, for the purpose of dominating a S' 1 Bagh i ! 1 a . d was the real reason for their excitement.

The Shaikh then turned to the nnp^Hrm r^-p ^ Ibn Sa'ud's letter to Lord Lloyd He said that th t0 ? gypt and about which Ibn Sa'ud was concerned was the T^K prmoi P a question Yemen. This made Ibn Sa'ud's Do4iorini. ^ P enetra tion of the trouble in its train. It was far the most vit 1 ^ '''t W i S ' ; ' ollrld to bring point of view.

The Shaikh replied that i was undoubtedly dangerous to Ibn Sa'ud, since it aimed generally at upsetting men s minds and destroying all authority. t ?' Shaikh then took his leave. I again urged on him to impress ? n -jn ka ud that I personally as High Commissioner entertained the ri t ri fl t v 0 ^ awar( ^ s rule and was anxious to see it strengthened an fi • iT i P as ^ insisted and should continue to insist that no ^ng snould be done from the 'Iraq side in a spirit unfriendly to him or designed to weaken his control.No. 38-S.

He informed High Commissioner of departure of raiding party just as High Commissioner had previously informed him of departure of Shammar raiding party. He did not con- -elude that the Shammar, whom he knew were acting contrary to MesopotajBian wishes, were out of control, and it should not be ♦ concluded that Dawish cannot be punished, but he will not punish Dawish till he gets the guarantee against harbouring of refugees which he mentioned before. Present situation im Hejd is matched everyday in Mesopotamia. There is no disturbance but some Bejd tribesmen attack Mesopotamia just at MAYI^, the Sharamari, twice attacked Shararat at Jauf, action about which he has just written to High Commissioner. Action of H.M's. Government in sending aeroplanes t0 Nejd is contrary to las. If Governments are to pursue raiders into their own territory definite agreement to the same effect should be made.

After oompliments, # We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Ho.0.14 dated 15th Rajab 1546 ( i.e. 8-1-28 ) in which you communicate to us the contents of the telegram you received from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in which he informs us of what the British Government had instructed him to write and inform us» We request you to telegraph to the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform the British Government of our following reply to (their) telegram;- The incidents narrated in the telegram about the action of the Dawish of which we disapprove had a bad effect on us and v/e are not going to let the Dawish f with all those who took part with him go without being punished. We never ourselves declared at any time that we were unable to punish the Dawish or any others. i v, \ ii The Government that has been established in this wide desert, which with its power, brought all forces that are in it under its control and managed its adminstration by the virtue of the social teachings of the religion^ and made all the desert tribes within the lands under our control obey our orders in a manner that cannot be compared with(that of any other Government ) in the world towards nomad tribes and the best proof of this, is the state of peace which is spread all over our king -dom and which makes us to boast and say that there is no similar tiling to be found in any country in the world^ A Government which by its own force made its authority 1 Cctyjs^ t-y 'l n ' /S a.^ , 'f ifb ' j. d' 'i(2) 1 nw firm in this vast country and establisliod this sort of rule will never be a weak one and unable to punish the Dawish and others like him# Nothing has prevented us from punishing the Dawish at the present time except what w'^ referred to in our s^v4ral letters which we sent to the British Government. \ We made one condition in the matter of purTtefujft^r the Dawish and his followers which we make clear in our tM r letter viz that the Iraq Government should undertake that when we punish the Dawish and his follow -srs should any of them run away to Iraq either before we effect the punishment or after it Iraq Government should undertake to turn him out and object to shelter him. When the Iraq Government make such an undertaking you will then see how we punish the Dawish and all those who took part with him in these actions of which we disapprove, it will be a punishment that, by the grace of God, will prevent them for ever from taking action on the frontier. But if we were to send a force today for their punishment which may or may not catch them and punish them, and then they run away to' Iraq Government and there the Iraq Government accept and welcome them, what will be the result of our punish -nent then. If the Iraq Government underrtake to turn them out when they take refuge with them then the present condition of affairs will be altered. With exceedingly great surprise we read that it is the intention of the British Governmmnt to attack with their Military aeroplanes the Mutair tribe at thexicxKtng places in which they are living in our country and kingdom and punish a party of our subjects in the interior of our country. V/ill not the British Government see in this action a breach of our \. independance and an aggression against our national authority which no inter ••national law wil^. allow(5) and which is never practised between Governments* This is one point and the second is that the correspond -ance on the subject is not over yet and the third one is who is going to lead those aeroplanes to those so that they may punish them criminalsj/and how can the aeroplanes know if the criminals are staying with their tribes-men or not and who sa,id that all the Mutair took part in these actions! If, God forbid, the aeroplanes take such action which(we never expect the British Government to take) we would dignify the British Government from taking (they will find) no Mutair tribesmen before them except the innocent who are busy praying to their God, and among them the baby, the old and helpless man and the woman. All these are from among those who had done no fault, and there is no doubt that the human law prevents transgression against them. As regards the mention of the Hon'ble the Political Resident that the present difficuilties will be settled by a meeting and verbal conversation, this is true, and we concur with his honour. When we find ourselves to to u. . iiave recouped our health and rel&amp;fcved of the sickness W0 have we will fix a time for our meeting x 'or the settlment of this trouble, within which time his honour will doubtless receive full instructions from His Majesty's Government regarding the proposals we suggested for the settlorient of the present trouble* U.S.Confidential ^ \ ^7 7 / Telegram-P, Prom Political, Bahrein, ^ i^igli C orimi s b i oner, Bagiidad., y No *58 BUSr !^ H9pfr^7&gt;c\ &gt; -^, - - M,, ,|, n , .JU,^ Dated 28th January 1928. ^ /Z ^ Cafe KfiDiU x • I have Just received a coummnication from H.M.the King of Hejaz and l^ejd addressed to Y, ^•in which he reports a raid near Jauf conduct ed by Shammar tribesmen from Iraq, which re sulted in the killing of men and carrying off of camels# His Majesty has not yet ascertained the number of casualties but he asks you to use your influence to prevent such raids.

We request you to communicate our reply to the (said) telegram to the ! Hon'ble the Political Resident which we ask his honour to forv/ard to His Majesty's Government as soon as possible We regret that the object of our letter which we sent to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq through. Kuwait was misunderstood and we also regret that the misunderstanding of the Hon'ble the Political Resident caused a delay in the reply for three weeks. We informed the High Commissioner in our letter StlO-' H o . m /^/ s ? dated the 12th Jamad 1,1346 (i.e,7-11-27 ) that the effect on the Najd people especially those t Vrl n ^ who are staying at the frontier has reached its limit on account of the Iraq Government and their breach of their undertaking regarding building the posts and the interferance of their officials' motor cars with our tribesmen with the intention of spoiling them and we ilCa -i were afraid of such effect hence we issued our orders for raore careful watch at the frontier but In spite of the precautions which we took we were inforraed that a few tribeenen intended to go out or that they may have gone out from unknown directions meaning Busalyah post to oppose its being built. And that we have ordered for more watch at the frontier and enquiries In this matter. This is the extract of what we informed file Ezcellency ^_ s ^nr» But His Excellency the High Commissioner In our i .zior. , t &lt;!m 0) oxn^aindd in the manner (described) in the telegram sent H4 g majesty *6 Government which was sent to ug recently that great trouble had broken out at Najd and that as the raiders were acting in defiance of our authority His Majesty f s Government have 'Dermitted the British Air \ craft as a temporary expedient and until our authority is reestablished over our recalcitrant tribes to persue the raiders accross the Iraq—Kajd frontier if necessary to punish the raiders in an effective manner 11 • This is the result of misunderstanding of our Object in our said letter to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq. Therefore we want to explain in this our letter certian points so that it may remove the misunderstanding that resulted from our previous letters. Many of the Iraq and Trans Jordanian tribes had previously attacked Wajd tribes. Were those tribes in their raids obeying the orders of the Iraq and Trans joran Governments or not ? Most certianly they were not obey -ing but were disobedient and (acting) against their orders, thus the Iraq and Trans Jordan Government were not able to stop them from their bad action and if they had iss&amp;istx&amp;HKx been able to do so thoy would had© done it. But those tribes came and plundered and then returned to -i their living places quite safely and peacfully and we never heard that any of those tribes w^s punished for raiding our tribes- Last year we were informed by His Excellency the High Commissioner that a party of Shammar who are residing in Iraq went against the orders of the Iraa Government and proceeded to the Syrian desert to rendez vous there with the intehtion of raiding our tribes and that an Iraq force supported by a British one war not able to set right that tribe and prevent it from its bad action. But when we were attacked by those mischievous raiders and when we received the letter.of His Excellency the High Commissioner that the Iraqlii that th© Iraq Government war© not able to stop the Shammar tribe we never explained that the Iraa Government were not able to punish their thoir tribes and they had no more control over them neither did we take the right in our hands by persui^Lng those raiders into the interior of their country, and punishing them there• As we know that wha t fthey had done was contrary to the opinion of thier Government. We can see no difference between the two situations, that of the Iraq Government towrds the raiders of their subjects and our present situation and the attack of the Dawish and his followers about whom we informed the British Government just as they(British Government) informed us of the movement of Shammar. However, we were open in our mention of matters which the Iraq Government used to keep quite. We said that we had made a more care -ful watch at the frontier but in spite of such watch some of the tribesmen had gone out and done what happened without our knowledge. Then we said we did not punish the Dawish for his action of which we disapprove as we know that the Iraq Government welcomes every one whom we punish on thier behalf who goes to them as they did in the case of Yusuf as-Sa'dun and his Hajd followers and as they recently did with Bin Mijlad when we punished him on their behalf. We will not punish the Dawish unless we get an undertaking that when we punish him the Iraq Government undertake not to accept him or any of those who took part with him. The situation in Najd which we explained has got a counterpart in Iraq every day and every hour, but the misunderstanding of the object ot our letter is the cause of news emanating from the 3ritis.'.i House of Common^ and the Chamber of Deputies in Iraq^ that there are disturbances and troubles in Najd while there are no disturbances and no trouble • All that happened is that Bom beduins attacked Iraq tribes just as A1 Mayiq of the Shataaar residing in Iraq who went out against the (will)* &gt;1 (4) v (7® Iraa Governmont smnA attackad the Shararat tribe at Jauf HsCkayiq) was accompaniad by ^0 canal-iman* Ha plundarad tlire'' hardG (ov/camals) . A sacond tima ha repeated this action in tha company of 15 creators of'trouble and attack -ad tha Shararat and took three other herds. We will write to His Excellency tha High Commissioner and protest against the action of A1 Mayiq, and what is tha diffferenct batwaen the action of the Mayiq and that of the Dawish• But wa took the way of being frank in saying so that wa may coma to a firm agreement (understanding ). While our authority over our tribesmen and subjects is regular and / complote- It was never explained in the past that whan a raiding party goes out to another* country the Government had no authority over its people and subjects. The action which, you- Informed us of that is that Bteltish Government intend to send their aeroplanes to the interior of our country for the punishment of our subjects this, just as k ■' III we said in our letter which we sent previous to this one, f is a new principle which no Government law will accept. And if the British Government find it an accepted principle an agreement should be reached before it is carried out and then this system will be adopted that should any m! raiders go to another country and th^n return/to their own country), then the raided Government will have the right to persue the criminals within their own country and punish them in it. When we adopt such an agreement and accept it then the situation will be changed. i These are our details which we put before the British Government and hope by them part of the misunder •standing may be cleared.

Many raids were mad^ before by the Transjordania tribesmen of we which A made a list of the total and submitted it to the British Government. Then a Tribunal of hothj sides(Hajd and Transjordania) was held to deal wit * those cases of plunder. The attitude of the Transjordania Government i made it unsucoesful and this made us inform His Excellency General Clayton when he was at Jiddali that we leave this disputed matter to the justice of the British Government to choose the way in v .liich we may be able to recover ttliei rights which the Najd people have lost. Many days have passed since we talked with His Excellency General Clayton but we have been unable to get any result.

We request His Britannic Eajetty's Uovemment/ i to give the matter a great consider -ation so that the robbed rights may be recovered and that the necessary steps may be taken in Transjordama to put^stop to these transgressions which have much increased.

He has some justification for his argument that a chain of fortresses in this locality is not conveniently sited for the purpose of inter cepting raiding parties crossing from Syria to Najd, and for his suspicion that the 'Iraq Government had some other motive for the creation of these posts. i 3. In the first place it seems advisable to explain to King Ibn Sa'ud that the list of posts south west of Nasiriyah and Diwaniyah contained in Mr. Bourdillon's letter to him of 17th August 1927, were, with the single exception of Busaiyah, old posts which had been established some time bfefore. It is therefore not the fact that the Iraq Government seized the opportunity of erecting a chain of posts in the desert. I enclose a statement showing the locality and strength of the police posts which existed in this region at the time of the attack on Busaiyah, and the dates on which they were establish ed. The statement includes the Abu Ghar post which has since been abandoned and also the Salam post which was only established in October 1927. The latter post was in an exposed position and had no defences of any ki'nd; ft was therefore abandoned after having been occupied for a few days. (It is, as you are aware, now being re-established and fortified). It was intended that a copy of this statement together with a map should be communicated to King Ibn Sa'ud in reply to his letter dated the 21st of September 1927, but the attack on Busaiyah intervened and the correspon dence was broken off. 1 4. Secondly it may be admitted that, although these desert posts as in telligence centres would undoubtedly facilitate the interception of any raid ing parties from Syria which might take the route to the east of the impass able Dahana desert (which lies close to the neutral zone), this was not the only consideration which prompted the 'Iraq Government to establish them. As you are aware, the 'Iraq shepherd tribes, who graze their flocks in the desert south west of Nasiriyah, have in the past years been terrorised by Faisal al Dawish into paying blackmail to his agents in return for immunity from his raids. The establishment of small desert police posts gave the tribes con fidence in the ability of the 'Iraq Government to protect them from Faisal al Dawish. It was therefore with the perfectly legitimate object of protecting their own tribes from Faisal al Dawish as well as preventing raids into Naid territory that the 'Iraq Government established these posts, and it is for that very reason that their establishment was so strongly resented by Faisal al Dawish and his following. 5. I suggest that, in the course of the conversation to be held with Kin^ Ibn Sa'ud, the facts to which I have referred in the preceding paragraphs should be laid frankly before him. 6 f 6. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to the Poli tical Resident, Bushire, the Political Agent, Kuwait, the High Commis sioner, Jerusalem, and the British Agent and Consul, Jeddah.Argument. 4. Ibn Sa'ud complains of the delay that occurred in answering his letters. He sent many protests and warnings and received no reply. This silence made him doubt the sincerity of the 'Iraq Government and greatly aggravated the crisis. He makes the following complaints in detail:— (i) In 1926 on receipt of a warning from the High Commissioner that Shammar tribes then in Syria contemplated raiding into Najd, he had written protesting against the 'Iraq Government for allowing this and asking that steps may be taken to prevent such raids. He received no reply for 10 months when the High Commissioner informed him of the establishment of posts on the frontier. Reply. of a post of 10 police in the desert 75 miles from the Najd frontier cannot possibly be inter preted as an offensive action against the Najd Government. The Busaiyah post was intended to be primarily an intelligence centre. Raiding parties from Syria seeking to enter Najd through the desert west and south of the Euphrates must pass east of the Dahana, and news of their approach would be transmitted by the Busaiyah post to headquarters, whereupon action would be taken to intercept the raiders before they entered Najd territory. Ibn Sa'ud suggests that the posts are useless to intercept such raiding parties, but it is significant that with two doubtful exceptions no raids into Najd from 'Iraq have taken place since the posts were established. 4. Ibn Sa'ud forgets that the transmission of letters to and from the interior of Najd is a slow business more particularly when his whereabouts and future movements are not known. Moreover his letters deal with important matters which it is often necessary not only for the departments of the 'Iraq Government but also for the departments of His Britannic Majesty's Government in London to examine and discuss before replies can be sent. To reply to his complaints seriatim :— (i) On receipt of the High Commissioner's warning Ibn Sa'ud wrote to the British Consul, Jeddah, on 22nd October 1926, and again on 13th November 1926, stating his point of view, namely, that 'Iraq must bear responsibility for raids from 'Iraq territory into Najd even though the raiders came from Syria and urging that steps should at once be taken to prevent such raids. The first of these letters was, we know, acknowledged by the British Consul and no doubt the second was too. No reply seemed to be immediately called for by the High Commissioner to whom the letters were not addressed. Action was, however, taken to carry out Ibn Sa'ud's wishes by the strengthening of existing police posts and by the establishment of an additional small post at Busaiyah where news of the movements of the raiding parties could be obtained so that action could be taken to intercept them. In consequence of these measures the Shammar tribes in Syria abandoned their intention of raiding into Najd and except for a minor raid which occurred in October 1927 no such raids eventuated so far as is known. This was in the circumstances the most effective reply possible to Ibn Sa'ud's requests. The Secretary of State, who had throughout been kept informed of the measures taken by the 'Iraq Government, approved them and suggested in July 1927 that Ibn Sa'ud should be informed of what had been done in order that he might realise that the 'Iraq Government was sincerely attempting to meet his wishes. Ibn Sa'ud was accordingly inform ed in detail of the action taken in Mr. Bourdillon's letter of 17th August 1927, which reached him after he had despatched his letter, dated 5th September 1927, protesting against the Busaiyah Post.Argument. 5. Ibn Sa'ud protests that ' aeroplanes from Iraq fly over the borders of our territories and over our tribes, some of them landing in the midst o, our lands ; also motor cars run through the neutral zone and the extremities of the border.' He says that these visits of aeroplanes and motor cars to the JNajcl frontier were deliberately provocative. 6. Ibn Sa'ud states that, whereas he has prevented all raids from Najd, 'raids on us have never been discontinued either by Iraq or by Trans- Jordania Reply. 5 There is no truth in the statement that Royal Air Force aeroplanes had crossed the Naid frontier (Ibn Sa'ud's letter was written on November 5th : aeroplanes have of course crossed the frontier since that date). Ibn Sa'ud has no grounds for objecting to air or ground reconnaissances provided they do not cross the frontier. Such reconnaissances are valuable or improving our knowledge of the topography of the country and correcting the existing maps as weU as for maintaining peace and seenrity in the desert They can on y be % Aose who are interested in resisting the extension of law and order in this area. [Such wconna sances have in the past extended to the neutral zone. This does not in any way . Article 1 (c) of the First Uqair Protocol which runs ; The area . • • • • will remain neutral and common to the two Governments of 'Iraq and Najd who will enjoy equal ngh s i it for all purposes.] , -d i a- It is worth noting that when Ibn Sa'ud wrote this protest on November 5th no Royal Air Force aeroplanes or cars from'Iraq had been nearer to the Najd frontier of the neutral zon than Busaiyah since the previous April. (It seems possible m th ® is referring to flights down the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. Whether Imperial ways have always respected the 3-mile limit we can't say. In any case this is nothmg whatever to do with the 'Iraq Government. 6 It is entirely untrue that raids from 'Iraq on Najd have never been d J sc ® nt f^ 1925 the 'Iraq Government moved the Najd refugees from the neighbourhood of the ^ajd frontier where they had in previous years made raids into Najd territory, to the northern Jazirah.' This extremely difficult operation, which was carried out solely with the object of preventing raids on Najd, was successfully accomplished and achieved its object for since th n rahte have vh'tually ceased. The stringent measures taken by the Iraq Government to prevent raiding however resulted in some of the Shammar sections crossing into Syria where the Ir ^ Government could not control them. It was reported that they intended from thereto raid Naid and the High Commissioner warned Ibn Sa'ud accordingly in order that e mio-bt realise that the tribes in question had passed out of the control of the Iraq Government. Ibn Sa'ud demanded that further steps should be taken by the 'Iraq Government to prevent these threatened raids from materialising, and the 'Iraq Government accordmglyesa small post at Busaiyah and tightened up the system of small P ollc ° as nearly as possible on the routes that such raidmg parties would follow m traversing Iraq territory in order that information of their movements could be obtained and steps .. intercept 'hem. These measures were entirely successful. With ^ doubtful except there have been no raids on Najd from 'Iraq or Syria since ®™'en rf the was from Syria, and the last raid by an 'Iraq tribe was m November 1923, 7 hen 8 ^ Dhafir carried out a very small raid across the frontier. In the circumstances Ihn Sa uds statements that raids have never been discontinued by 'Iraq is entirely eontrary o _ reveals a singular lack of appreciation of the energetic and successful efforts mad 5 ' Government to prevent such raids.! r i 7. Ibn Sa'ud protests against the interference of the 'Iraq Government with his tribes and cites the action of the Mutasarriff, Diwaniyah, in addressing Muhammad ibn Turki and Jazza' ibn Mijlad direct. A The first doubtful exception was a retaliatory raid by the Suqur (Amarat) on Muhammad ibn Turki of the Dahamshah (Amarat) and took place in February 1927. Muhammad ibn Turki who had been camped on the Najd side of the frontier crossed into 'Iraq and looted 50 camels of the Suqur, subsequently retiring across the frontier again. The Suqur, however, followed him across the frontier and looted a similar number of camels. Private negotiations for the reciprocal exchange of the looted animals failed owing to Muhammad Turki's refusal to hand over the Suqur camels. The Mutasarrif, Diwaniyah, complained to Ibn Musa'ad, Amir of Hail, who sent a force under Ad wan ibn Rammal against Muhammad Turki. The latter crossed again into 'Iraq. Adwan ibn Rammal followed across the frontier and attacked him in 'Iraq territory capturing 150— 200 animals. The exchange of camels with the Suqur is now being arranged. This is not an ordinary case of raiding between 'Iraq and Najd tribes because the Dahamshah are an 'Iraq tribe (though Ibn Sa'ud disputes this). Moreover the first raid (by the Dahamshah on the Suqur) was from Najd into 'Iraq. Adwan ibn Rammal's raid on the Dahamshah on 'Iraq territory was also an irregularity against which 'Iraq has protested, though the motive of the raid was good. This Suqur-Dahamshah incident is being satisfactorily settled and there is no need for the matter to be raised with Ibn Sa'ud, but it is possible that he will cite the Suqur raid as an 'Iraq raid against Najd, when it can be pointed out that it was preceded and followed by raids from Najd into 'Iraq. The second exception occurred at the end of October 1927. The Rutbah post telegraphed on November 2nd that a party of Shammar and Fid'an passed through Ga'arah when returning to Syria with 50 camels looted from the Najd Ruwallah at Jauf. The camels had been seized by a' Sba' chief in 'Iraq and sent by him to his Rais who handed over the camels to Nuri Sha'lan. The said Rais was subsequently reprimanded by the 'Iraq Commandant of Police for not having brought the camels to the Muhaiwir post. The Mutasarrif, Dulaim, subsequent ly received a letter from the Amir of Hail claiming the return of the camels to which he replied that the raid was carried out by Syrian tribes, that he could not do anything and that the claim should be addressed to the Syrian Government. Ibn Sa'ud has never protested against this raid and may be ignorant of it ; on the other hand he may bring it up in justifica tion of his statement about raids from Iraq. 7. This raises a longstanding controversy which is still being pursued. Ibn Sa'ud claims that Article 1 of the Second Uqair Protocol was expressly intended to cover Muhammad bin Turki and Jazza' ibn Mijlad and their tribe, the Dahamshah. This is disputed by 'Iraq which claims that the Dahamshah, being a section of the Amarat, are an 'Iraq tribe under Article 1 (a) of the Muhammerah Treaty. Ibn Sa'ud forwarded a copy of a letter addressed by the Mutasarrif, Diwaniyah, to Jazza' ibn Mijlad, but when the letter was written Jazza' ibn Mijlad was in 'Iraq territory and Ibn Sa'ud has therefore no grounds for complaint.6 Argument. 8. Ibn Sa ud complains that Iraq newspapers, ' especially those con nected with the high Government officials, ' have attacked and insulted Najd and to this he attributes in part the resentment of his tribes against 'Iraq. Reply. On the other hand the 'Iraq Government have had cause to complain of the giving of presents by Ibn Sa'ud to certain Dhafir Shaikhs, namely, Ajaimi al Suwait, Hazza' ibn 'Agab Hamdan ibn Duwaihis, Khamis al Aslab and others, with the result that many of them have settled m Najd territory. The 'Iraq Government find it difficult to reconcile Ibn Sa'ud's action with the terms of Article 4 of the Bahra Agreement. There has been correspondence with Ibn ba ud on this subject. 8. The local press for the period July to December 1927 has been examined and a note is attached showing the result. As will be seen the 'Iraq Press has not shown undue hostilitv to Ibn ba ud, and has at times been markedly friendly. ' Al Zaman ' newspaper, in particular published on 7th October 1927 an article strongly supporting Ibn Sa'ud and deprecating criticism of his regime. This paper was closely ' connected with High Government officials ' It may be noted that in a recent article dated 16th December 1927 ' Um al Qura ' of Mecca (a paper which incidentally has not shown much friendliness toward 'Iraq) referred to ' the malevolent ' Alif Ba and other 'Iraq journals.' ' Alif Ba ' is a Syrian newspaper and it seems possible, therefore, that the 'Iraq newspapers are being held responsible by Ibn Sa'ud for the misdeeds of their Syrian contemporaries. Ibn Sa'ud probably finds it difficult to understand the ' freedom of the press ' which obtains in 'Iraq. Suffice it to say that the local press has on occasions attacked both the 'Iraq and British Governments more violentlv than it ha.s attacked Ibn Sa'ud,9 Enclo. 2 of Serial No. 181.

(d) Treaty of Jeddah : The 'Iraq press was almost equally divided in their reception of this treaty—some acclaiming it as a sreat success, others as a camouflaged failure ; it may, however be remarked that opinions of the latter type were mainly taken irom the by nan press.

' {g) Najdi danger to Kuwait. (h) Akhwan attacks on 'Iraq territory. (3) On careful examination of publications in the 'Iraq press on these subjects a fairminded man can easily discern the following ; (a) The Iraq press as a whole has given fair publication in its columns to information creditable to Ibn Sa'ud in connection with his administration of affairs in his territories—except in regard to the pulling down of holy shrines in Madina. (h) In matters relating to the general policy of Ibn Sa'ud, the ' 'Iraq ' has been condemnatory in its tone, the Istiqlal 'gave publication to information and views creditable to Ibn Sa'ud and the 44 Zaman ' put up on one occasion a strong defence of Ibn Sa'ud as a great servant of the Arab cause. The ' Nahdha' (a Shi'ah newspaper) was, as can be expected, condemnatory. In this connection it may be pointed out that ' Az-Zaman,' which put up such a defence of Ibn Sa'ud, was intimately connected with Nuri Pasha al Sa'id, a Minister of the 'Iraq Government and a recognised favourite of His Majesty King Faisal. (c) In dealing with rumoured attempts by Najd agents for winnino- Zubairis to Najd nationality and with Akhwan attacks on # 'Iraq territory, no one can reasonably expect the 'Iraq press to be less violent against Ibn Sa'ud. In the meantime it may be pointed out that in the early stage of the recent series of Akhwan attapks, the 'Iraq press 'was almost unanimous in10 trying to disassociate Ibn Sa'ud and lay the blame solely on the Dawish, calling upon the former to hold his rebellious followers in check. On the whole it may be said that in a comparatively progressive country like 'Iraq, with laws providing for the freedom of the press, no check within the law could have been exercised on the press in view of the provocation received. Within the last six months a section of the press in Iraq has been considerably more offensive against both the 'Iraq and British Governments than against Ibn Sa'ud. 976(0 p&amp;ri)12 \ V Enclosure 4 of Serial No. 181. \ Telegram from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political resi dent in the Persian Gijlf, Bushire , No. 83, dated the 11th Feb ruary 1928. \ \ (Repeated Highcoma, Baghdad, Special Service Officers at Basrah and Napiriyah.)

' „ . 16 ^ lonour transmit herewith a translation of a letter of the 25th ultimo addressed to me by King Ibn Saud from Eiyadh. On this letter and on 1 s comments thereon was based my telegram No. 4 of the 7th instant, fhe King had unfortunately at the time of writing not received the communication addressed to him in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 1 of the 13th January. 3* ma kes no mention of His Majesty's Government's invitation to meet Colonel naworth, though I gather from paragraph 15 of Bagdad Intelligence Report No. 1 of 1928 that the invitation accompanied a protest against the Mutair raid of the 9th December, and the ' warning ' referred to by him in the second paragraph of the Kings letter may be the 'invitation.' 4. Ibn baud has received Hafez Wahba's report from Koweit; he is surprised that the building of a post at Busaya is not regarded as a breach of the Uqair protocol. He gives as evidence that it must be so considered his own refusal to allow Nejdi tribes to build at Lina and other water holes near the frontier. Lina is more than 30 miles in a straight line from the nearest point of the neutral zone. 5. Ihe King is convinced that the building of the Busaya post was an act of intentional provocation calculated to cause friction between himself and Feisal- ud-Doweish. 6. The King view 7 s with disfavour the proposal conveyed through Hafez Wahba that the question of building should be referred to a commission of arbitration. He wishes the question to be settled as between himself and His Majesty's Government, and is confident that the latter will see the justice of his contention. 7. He then draws the attention of His Majesty's Government to the very critical position in which he now stands. He is faced with one of two risks : either to silence Nejd opinion by force of arms, and the whole of Nejd may be against him, or by not doing so to find himself in conflict with His Majesty's Government—an alternative opposed both to his wishes and to the interests of Arabia. 8. He begs His Majesty's Government to find a solution to his difficulties by removing the present causes of friction ; a definite settlement must be arrived at, both as regards the building of posts and the harbouring by Iraq of Nejdi raiders. 9. I discussed the King's letter very fully with the Director of Foreign Affairs before despatching my telegram under reference. I told Dr. Damluji that I would certainly telegraph, but that I could not w r ire the letter in extenso, first because I had already reported the Nejd point of view fully by despatch, and His Majesty's letter brought out no new points, and, secondly, because the communication which on your instruction I had addressed to Ibn Saud was an answer to the King's request for your assistance. I begged Dr. Damluji to use all his influence to induce Ibn Saud to accept the invitation to meet the Political Resident at Bushire. Colonel Haw r orth was entirely independent of Iraq and could have no anti-Nejd bias. 10. As regards Ibn Sand's accusation against Iraq of harbouring Nejdi raiders, I pointed out that the persons referred to were claimed by Iraq as Iraqi subjects. Ibn Saud fears that if Feisal-ud-Doweish takes refuge in Iraq he will be harboured there. I said that I thought his fears in this respect were surely groundless. 11. Neither the production of maps nor photographs will, I fear, convince Ibn Saud that Iraq were justified in building a post at Busaya. He understood the wells in the vicinity of the frontier to mean all wells in the desert area usually frequented by tribes of both sides. His refusal to allow building to be carried on around wells in his own territory is evidence of his belief. In the absence of any mention in the protocol of a definite prohibited radius, it is certainly difficult to say at what distance from the frontier posts may be erected without infringing the terms of the agreement.

Action suggested would definitely link Kuwait with 'Iraq in Ibn Saud's mind and points are, first, whether (a) with present Iraq strained relations this is desirable in Kuwait interests or (b) at any time in furtherance of our future policy, second, whether Air and Iraq present necess- -ities are sufficient to outweigh other political consider- -ations. Kuwait's commercial prosperity depends upon Nejd and the town is stagnant owing to Ibn Saud^ embargo on transit trade with Hejd: this is one of the subjects I hope to get settled with Ibn Saud when I meet him. ibn Saud is already sore oyer Kuwait but with added irritation of aero- -planes stationed in Kuwait talcing action on behalf of Iraq against distant objectiTes in Hejd this soreness will necessarily become enmity without corresponding benefit to Kuwaito The advantage of Ibn Saud learning that Kuwait has adequate support is, I think, outweighed by the position which would arise, and which I think would only be permissibl if our relations with Ibn Saud were definitely ruptured. In jax writing to Ibn Saud I stated that 1 felt sure that a meeting seoox with him would put an end to present unfortunate conditions: in replying he has taken up this point and says that he is in full agreement with this and that unquestionably a meeting will have the effect of ending present difficulties. With the bad case which he h •has at present I would in his position myself play for time before having the meeting.Until then Meeting takes place or definitely is not to take place 1 would take no action to make our relations aore difficult except such aa is odiously necessary for protection of Kuwait and Iraq, frontiers.

Flahtlng. at Rlaa 'i MEMORANDUM. With reference to my telegram No. 55 dated the 27th January 1928 and subsequent correspondence on the subject of the recent fighting on the borders of Kuwait, the following is an account of what actually happened. On the evening of Friday, the a7th January,news reached Kuwait that 'All bin 'Ashwan, of the Aulad Wasil sub-section of the Buraih section of the Mutair, with a force of camel riders and 50 horsemen, had raided the Kuwait tmrifTKinr' ♦ ! tJraibdar, or local Arabs, at Umm Ruwaisat in the Shiqaq district, 38 miles to the north west of Jahrah, killing three men and carrying off a considerable number of camels and sheep. All available cars were at once commandeered and sent out to Jahrah the same night, with orders to proceed to Riqa'i, $0 miles further to the west,south-west, as soon as it was light enough to see , in the hope of cutting off the raiders' retreat# This they nn .TrWi in doing, and at 4,30 p.m. on the 28th January fifteen cars out of twenty five which had left view of the fact that there is no road beyond Jahrah, and all the cars were grossly overloaded, some carrying as manv as nine men. There they encountered the raiders, and at once attacked them. Although only numbering about 75 rifles, the Kuwait force was very much better armed than 3ucce.eciecc Kuwait arrived at Riqa'i - a very creditable performance in(2) the raiders, to whom moreover the motor oar was an enti new factor In war. The result was that the Kuwait force inflicted very heavy casualties On the enemy, and forced them to abandon a considerable portion of the booty. Their own casualties were comparatively light, but included Shaikh 'All al-Khalffah (the commander-in-chief of the Kuwait forces) who was severely wounded, and Shaikh 'Abdullah al- Jabir (the brother of the Shaikh of Kuwait) who was slightly wounded. After the engagement proper was over Shaikh 'All as- S^llni (a son of the late Shaikh of Kuwait) a very gallant but hot-heafied and rash young man, who had been delayed by car trouble, arrived on the scene, touch galled at being too late for the engagement. In direct defiance of orders he in sisted on pressing on alone, with the result that he and his party were trapped in the Batin, kjsjcjs where they fought till they ran out of ammunition, and were eventually butchered in cold blood. But for this regretable incident,the action of the Kuwait force would have been an unqualified success* As it was, the Kuwait casualties on the 28th January amounted to eleven killed and about the same number wounded, of whom one has since died# The casualties amongst the Mutair are not accurately known, but twenty seven killed is the most modest estimate, and something between thirty five and forty is probably nearer the correct figure* In addition to this many were doubtless wounded and a con siderable number of animals were killed. Pour Kuwait cars had to be temporarily abandoned, but these have since been brought in* n On the 29th January British aeroplanes located the raiders in Najd territory fifteen miles north of Hafar al« B*Jtin» The raiders opened fire on the aircraft, which replied with bombs and machine-^un fire, inflicting casualties estimated at ten men and twenty camels killed# On the afternoon of the 30th January our aeroplanes twice attacked the raiders eight miles south of ife|btr al-(3) Batin, and are believed to havp k-i n i 4- t jv-illed ty/elve men and a'' number of camels and horses. On tne whole the raiders appear to have suffered very neavily, and will probably not look upon Kuwait tribes as Tne extensive use of cars by the Kuwait forces in this ensagement i s interestins, and it e ive S them an advantage over the Ikhw^n which the latter can never counter.
