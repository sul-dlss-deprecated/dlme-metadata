I now send you a copy of the reply from Cairo,from s / which you will see that the Embassy have arranged for Tewfik r Doss Pasha to go to Koweit. 3- Tewfik Doss Pasha is a Copt, and apparently a most aole lawyer. The most recent Personalities Report (of which I send you an extract} talks of his 'tortuous methods' and 'strong suspicions of corruption', hut if he gets a fee of the proportions recommended in this telegram it will not be worth his while to attempt to douhlecross the Sheikh (and in fact almost impossible for him to do so, as he will only be giving advice out of court), especially as he has been made aware of the interest taken by His Majesty’s Government in the case. In any case, the Embassy must have had good reasons for choosing him and it is too late to question their choice now, unless you think the fee too high. 4 * Y ou may prefer that if possible the question of the Pasha’s fees should be settled before he leaves for Kjweit,and I should thereiore be glad to learn your views as soon as possiole.

Well educated (American Mission),with an excellent knowledge of English and French; possesses marked ability as a speaker. He made a big reputation for himself defending political prisoners under martial law in the early days of the Independence movement - among others, Abdurrahman Fahmy Bey in the ll Yengeance Society' trial.

Minister of Agriculture in Ziwer Pasha 1 s Cabinet, March-Septesber 1925, when he xell under palace influence and made desperate attempts to retain ofiice in September 1925, but could not quite manage it. However, he sent in a conditional resignation from the Liberal party, and for some months he ceased to attend party meetings. Stood for the Beni Korra constituency (Assiout) against Ahmed Khashaba pasha (Wafdist) in the elections of May 1926. Thanks to strong Ittehadist backing and interference of the Ziwer Government on his side, he was elected Deputy, wt resigned when a :Out to be unseated by the Chamber on the charge (justifiable) of electoral irregularities* From 1927 on Tewfik Doss^ connexion with the palace has become much closer. He played a prominent pait in supporting the candidature of the present corrupt Coptic Patriarch against the reformers, and he was in league with His late Majesty and the Patriarch in certain obscure financial misappropriations of Coptic vi/aqfs. He/2 He was much against the appointment of Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha and in favour of Sidky at the time of the coup d ! Etat of 1928, and no one was surprised when, in June 193C,Sidky made him Minister of Communications. He joined the Executive Committee of Lhe Shashist party in December 193C. He was the Cabinet mouthpiece to foreigh press correspondents and the 'well-informed” source of their telegrams. His tortuous methods complicated, but fortunately did not prevent, the Aviation and Wireless and Cables settlements in 1932. Strong suspicions of corruption made him an embarrassing colleague in the Cabinet, but his omission from Sidky Pasha’s second Cabinet in January 1933, for which the late King was responsible, appeared not to have affected his close personal relations with the prime Minister. He was suggested for the Washington Legation, where he could hardly have been persona grata, but ”preferred to serve his country as a Deputy in the 'Chamber”. After Sidky Pasha’s eclipse he played a somewhat equivocal role, leaving the main parliamentary attack on his former crony to his brother Wahi'b. A third brother, Habib, supported the Government in the Senate. He is no longer persona grata in the palace, but would no doubt like to be so again.

KUWAIT DATE GARDENS . Shaikh’s Egyptian Lawyer arrives Hotel Maude Baghdad this morning 24th March. You may wish to see him. Politj cal(176/3/38) No /P~V Dated \ AIR MAlZi* 9th March, 1938. My dear Baggallay, I am writing in haste to tell you of the latest developments in the affair of the properties of the Shaikh of Ko*eit In Iraq. Towards the middle of February, one of the senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked Holt to go to see him to discus© ^attman 1 s Mote Ho. 347 of July 8th, 1936, in which, as you will remember, it was proposed that Land Settlement procedure should be employed to dispose of ' disputes concerning the Shaikh of Koweit 1 s garden in Iraq* Holt’s talks in the Minis try led to the production of a draft reply to Bateman’s note, a copy of which I enclose herein. Holt was told that this was only a departmental draft and that before they put it up to the Council of Ministers the Ministry would like to know privately whether it was lively to be acceptable to liis Majesty’s Government. Holt pointed out that it would not be possible ior the Embassy to recommend His Majesty’s Government to agree to paragraph 5 of the draft. This paragraph leaves it in doubt whether the Shaikh would be given deeds for land awarded to him by the Settlement Officer, if such land was not ’mulk* (freehold). That is to lay if it was ’alienated’ land or what in Arabic is called ’ miri rnufawwaz ’ and in the Settlement Law ’miri land granted in Tapu ’ (English version Article 3 XV) « Holt’s view was that the reservation contained in the second part of this paragraph might result in title deeds being refused to the Shaikh, on the grounds that ho was &amp; foreigner BAGGALLAY, ESQ.foreigner, for a great deal of his properties even though his claim to them 'sas recognised by the Settlement Officer, and Aston (one of the Settlement Officers who had been consulted closely by Bateman when his note was prepared) confirmed this view. The Ministry were therefore told that,although the rest of the draft looked good, we could not accept paragra; h 5, and they were asked to try to redraft it. We had hoped at first to be able to get this done and the letter sent off to you for comments well in time for a decision to be reached and Settlement declared before the Faddaghiyah case comes before the courts at Basra on March 2Sr&amp;, but this hope is now fading. holt has been bothering the Ministry, but although a fairly satisfactory new draft of paragraph 5 is now, he thinks, being studied in the Ministry of Justice, the process is slow. Yesterday morning, I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and urged him to get the thing settled in time to stop the case coming on in Basra, and he said he would do his best. In the meanwhile, perhaps Fowle'a efforts to obtain a postponement my succeed. However, it looks as though there may have to be some heavy telegraphing in a few days 1 time, so X am sending you the draft now in order that you may know what is being done Apart from paragraph 5, it seems to be good enough, and I am enclosing a short note commencing on it paragraph paragraph. There is, however, a further difficulty. A new Land Settlement Law which is to supersede Law Mo. 50 of 1932 is now before Parliament and has already passed its third reading in««* 3 * ■ * the Chamber of Deputies. No authentic text has yet been published, but v*e have an Arabic text published in the press, fhis shows that, except for Articles 10, 11 and 30, the amendments made are textual, and involve no change in the meaning or purpose of the law. I enclose a translation of Article 10. In the opinion of Aston (the Land Settlement Officer) in its new form this article would, in application, work no less favourably for the Shaikh of Aoweit than the old article. Article 11 which deals with the grant of hazim rights has been extensively redrafted in so far as it concerns the acquisition of title by pump owners and it contains a new and essential provision that Aazma rights shall only be granted to Iraqis. It seems, however, that it was never expected that the Shaikh of Koweit could gain any advantages under this article and the restriction of the grant of hazira rights to Iraqis should not, therefore, react unfavourably on the Shaikh’s position. Article 32 has been recast without change of meaning. I enclose a translation. It seems, therefore, that the new law does not change the basis on which the original proposals contained in the Ait mm note were drawn up. X am sending a copy of this letter to Fowl© at Jushire and De Gaury at howeit. lours ever.IEA.QI SSAPT KS.’W TO Mr. BATEKAM'S LETTER TO HUiil miiA Ko. 347 of JULY 8til, 1936. (ENCLOSURE TO SAOML iJSSPATCH TO THE ypRIilOM OFPICf:, Bo. 368 of JULY 15th. 1936V ;; ;&gt; Your Excellency, The propoaals concerning the properties in Iraq claimed, by the Shaikhs or Kowoit and Mohai®ieI’fth which were contained in Mr. G.K. Batenan’e Mote ho. 54? of July ath, 1936, addressed to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Al Sayid Muri A1 Said, have now received the careful consideration of the Iraqi Government. 2. The Iraqi Govarmient are disposed to accept these proposals, subject to the following*- 3. With regard to sub-paragx*&amp;ph (a) of paragraph 6 of '&lt;r. BatetMan’ s Bote, legislation must be passed befoi»e the undertaking can be given. The Iraqi Government are prepared to propose such legislation and, on its coming into force, to give the undertaking requested. 4. With regard to sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 6, the British Government may rest assured that the Iraqi Government have no intention of imposing discriminatory taxation on the property of any person in Iraq. Further more, the British Government must be aware that such taxation would be in conflict with the provisions of the Iraqi Constitution. The Iraqi Government do not, therefore, consider it proper or necessary for any further assurance to be given by them in this connection. 5. With regard to paragraph 8, the Iraqi Government confirm that the Shaikhs* non-Iraqi nationality will constitute no impediment or delay to the completion of the registration in the case of ! ‘mulk* f property, but should it appear in the course of the Land Settlement procedure that an alienated property is claimed, the non-Iraqi nationality of the claimant to the property must be taken into account in accordance with the existing law. 6 . m i I t6* The Iraqi G^venvaeiit are prepared to give the assurance mentioned in paragraph 9 on the basis of the hand Settlement haw or the Regulation® issued thereunder# 7. ith regard to paragraph 10, it is necessary to point out that Article 25 (b) of the Land Settlement haw provides that all Judgments of the Special Court are subject to appeal to the Court of Cassation on points of law# The Iraqi Government cannot, therefore, confine litigation against the Shaikh of Koweit to appeals, against the decisions of Land Settlement Officer, to the Special Court set up by virtu© of Article 4 of the Law. 8# With regard to paragraph 12, it follows from paragraph 7 above that the British Government should recognise the decision of the Court of Cassation as well as the decisions of the Land Settlement Officer and the Special Court, and that the British Government* s undertaking not to object to any changes which raay result to the present boundaries of the Shaikhs* lands in consequence of the land settlement procedure must extend to changes which may result from any decision© of the Court of Cassation# 9. The Iraqi Government consider it necessary as part of the settlement of the present question to put an end finally to all dispute© as to the competence of the Iraqi Courts and the application of Iraqi law in all matters relating to immovable property in Iraq owned or possessed by either Shaikh or in which either Shaikh has or claims an interest, and for this purpose the Iraqi Government declare that for the future they will exercise the Iraqi jurisdiction over such property and all matters relating thereto without any distinction being made between it and other immovable property In Iraq or between the Shaikhs and other persona interested in immovable property in Iraq.3- 10 . On receiving the British Government* $ acceptance of the condition© abavernention©d the Iraqi Oovernment are prepared to carry out with a minimum of delay the course of action proposed in r.

There appears to be no possibility of excluding appeal to the Court of Cassation under Article 25 (b) of the Land Settlement Law.

In view of the ruling given in paragraph 4 of Foreign Office despatch Go. 262 of April 27th, 1936, it seems that the Iraqi declaration of Intention to exercise full jurisdiction over the properties of the bhaikhs which is contained in this paragraph need not be contested. Ho reference is made in the draft to the suggestion put forward in paragraph 10 of Mr. Gaternan's note that the Special Court provided for in Article 4 of the Land Settlement Law should be set up In Basra under the • resident of the Civil Court. It would, however, be possible to maintain that paragraph 10 of the draft reply implies agreement to this suggestion.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, ' (Forgive me, if I have not your present mode of address correct. I have no books of reference by me). I have received your confidential letter No.P.Z.3380/33 about the Shaikh of Kaweit's date-gardens near Basra. So far as I remember, there was not issued during my time any order by the Army Commander specifying the Revenue Commissioner’s duties, in fact I think that I was opposed to the issue of any such order at the beginning, since my work then included such a medley of Turkish Departments of which we scarcely knew the names and included the Judicial Department. I do, however, remember distinctly that a special order Y*ras issued about the reopening of the Tapu Department, which had been closed, I think, frcro the beginning of the War until April 1915. If this order cannot be found in the files of orders by the Army Commander, it is practically certain to have jaeen published in the Basra Times, since I remember that I made special efforts to give the greatest possible publicity to the fact bf the reopening. It is possible that this order v/ill be i found to include a specifixation of the powers of the Revenue Commissioner in relation to Tapu operations. A t would of course be a general disaster to the inhabitajits of Basra, were the Tapu Powers of the Revenue Commissioner in 1915 and 1916 now to be successfully challenged since immense arrears of applice/bions for Tapu Transfers had accumulated under the Turks and I worked them off pretty rapidly, enquiring into and signing some thousands of transfers Many titles would be invalidated and there v/ould be general discontent./discontent. I can hardly believe that the Iraq Government would choose now to adopt such a course. Yours sincerely, Sd/~, H. Dobbs.

INDIA OFFICE V/hitehall, S.W.l. 7th July 1933. My dear George, We sent you a few days ago copy of a letter to Sir denry Dobbs on the subject of the Sheikh’s date gardens. I now enclose a copy of his reply which is, I think, self-explanatory. We will again make a search here for the special order about the reopening of the Tapu Department. But might I suggest that it might be worth while to ask Baghdad without further delay whether they can help in this matter? It is quite possible that, even if certain of their records have been destroyed, they will be in a position to trace the order to which Sir Henry Dobbs refers more rapidly than will be possible for us here. We should all, I think, agree with the last paragraph of Sir Henry Dobb’s letter and the point which he makes seems an additional argument for general validatory action on the lines which we have been contemplating.

But tuis protection is of a special nature, for tae Agreement apart from tnese gei^rai undertakings based on tue principles of We general Intentiation&amp;l Law, special guarantees wnereby Great Britain undertake to safeguard t*.e properties in Basrali of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, especially mentioned fhereae Great Britain stood as guarantor for the properti« in Basrah oi* the Kuwait Emirate and particularly those of the family of His Highness tae Huler of Kuwait ubarak el Sabah, his sons and grand T sons tiie guarantor State has, in accordance with the principles of tiie general International haw, tne right to interfere when anotner State, through axiy of her judicial boay wiiatsoever, attempts to affect what has been guaranteed by tne State. The validity of such interference is being one of tne most complicated ai*u critical matters in tne International law, particularly when the euacters did not observe full care when dealing therewith. The discussion, however, of tae acts of hue Jtates is of no use not because tne States are adopting differential principles only but it is also due to tue fact that some States act, in certain events, as such that it conflicts with their action in other similar of the numerous historical events impracticable. I n such occasions it is imperative to refer to the original principles of procedure in respect of the independence and the protection obligations. concluded between Britain and the Kuwait Emirate embodies, therein, and among which is the property of P&amp;daghiya. event, a matter which renders the deduction of any procedure . • —..Interference is almost a political method whicn is not free from encroacjument upon Justice. But in exceptional cases, tnis interference may sometl.:.es be coma a legal rignt although tne adoption tuereof leads to tne infrii-ige^ent of tne moral obligations e.g. tne interference for the realisation of a right embodied in a Treaty and/or in tne International ruling i.e. in the event of the interference of tne State which had guaranteed tne safety of tne property of ano Uier State or t..e safety of tne ruling family or of other definite aliape of Governments therein* There are many events of interference in t*.e history e*g* tae interference of the nited States with Cuba in l^Ot which interference had occurred oy virtue of the provisions of tue Treaty of Havana of 1903 wherein America was given the right to interfere with a view to protecting tne independence of Cuba under tne control of a regular Government in oraer to protect life, property and liberty* In tne circumstances, ti*e dispute is now regarded to nave taken place between Great Britain anu tne Goveriiment of Iraq, as tne latter being responsible for t*,e rights of her subjects Who are *.er own people* By eaying that the dispute is raised between Great Britain arid ti*e Govexument of Iraq we base our indication on tne guarantee referred to above which nas been assumed by the -ritisn Govemmeiit towards tne Emirate of Kuwait for U*e protection of t^ose properties which are now the subject of the suit under review. How we nave to discuss whether tne relations effected between Great Britain and tne Government of Iraq allow in# ordinary Courts in Iraq to pass decision in such dispute or tne same is being outside their province* War was declared against Turkey on otii toveiaher 1914 when Iraq was one of tu© Turkish Vilayets* The 'English Troops occupied the Basraa Vilayet on 6 th HovCiftber 1914, and, by virtue of her Occupation Britain had the same rights as usuallyenjoyed by any Government in the occupied lends. The Iraqi lands re?nained under the Occupation of the British Government since that date until 1922 when she made agreement with the Iraqi Nation and had also concluded another 0 , it thereafter under a Treaty executed in 1926. Ol 30th June 1930 she had executed further Treaty designed as ’‘Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq” which Treaty had, in Article (7), covered a convention which reads as follows :- • 1 Thia rreety re siacea jt ie ^ treaties - x 11 anc e “signed at Baghdad on the 10th day of October 1922 ““corresponding to 19th Gafar 1341 and on the 16th January “1926 correspondin'' to 23th damadi el Akhar 11 ^- . as “the sunolementary conventions thereof which shall be • “repealed when this Treaty is put into execution*. Therefore, the Treaty of 1930 became in force instead of the other treaties previously concluded between Great Britain ant' the Kingdom of Iraq. This Treaty covered a clear definition whereby the Kingdom of Iraq is bound to respect any guarantee given by the British Government to others since such guarantee is not being in contravention with the covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaty for the prevention of Jar. In other word ; it has been stipulated that this guarantee, xr icn shoui bo esteemed, became a legitimate one possessed by those who had assumed the same. The following is the text embodied in the Treaty of 1930:- “Art!c1e (9). Toth ing in this Tre a ty which 7 wh a t b o• ve r “or aims at the breach of rights and guarantees attached or “being attached to or against any othe high contracting “parties in conformity with the Covenant of the r.ea ue of “Nations or the Treaty for the prevention of -ar signed at “Paris on the 27th day of August 1923“. It will therefore be gathered from the foreroin that Greatwiiicii provides tnat no one of tixe contracting party should offend tue other or affect his interests, in ti*e interior or outside, or his relationship with the otiier States* This alliance had also provided that tne guarantees against Great Britain should be esteemed by txie Iraqi Kingdom* It ixas been outlined above that England had assumed a guarantee towards the Emirate of Kuwait to safeguard the properties in Basrah of the said .Emirate which specifically involve Fadaghiya Property as well* The matter did not end with this point but the Treaty of 1330 embodies a definition governing the solution method to be adopted when any dispute creeps in oetween both States in connection witii txi© interpretation or application of this Treaty* Article 10 provides as follows s~ w When any dispute takes place in connection with the application of this Treaty or the interpretation Uiereof and both tne high contracting parties did not come to conclusion by direct negotiation between them the dispute may taen be treated in conformity with tne provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations”* This definition itself renders tnis suit outside the duty of the Courts in the Iraqi Kingdom as tne basis of the present dispute, as stated above, is confined to toe fact toat certain Iraqi individuals are claiming from a foreign Emirate, i*e* the Kuwait Emirate, for her certain properties in Iraq whilst this Emirate is protected by Great Britain who ensures her properties in Basrah* The guarantee or covenant of Great Britain could not be affected by toe Alliance Treaty concluded between Great Britain and toe Kingdom of Iraq by virtue of Article 9 of this Treaty* Therefore, the discussion now permeates the subject oi interpretation of tola Treaty and the application thereof, and, it has been agreed that this interpretation and application is beyond the jurisdiction of toe ordinary Courts as, by virtueY&gt; oi tne pi'Ovisions of Articl (10), it nas been renasreci as suoject to nsgotiations be Ween botii States and, snould the/ fail, the dispute should tuen oe settled in ooni'omity with the Covenant of the League of Nations. Tne Covenant of tne league of Nations which had organized tne relationship of the States who acceded thereto had, likewise, taken into consideration such event as well, for Article (16) of tnls Covenant provides as follows t- wth# members of tne League agree that k an/ dispute wt*.Wn arises and timy consider that suen dispute is solvable b/ means of arbitration out coulu not be solved satisfactorily in a political way the subject of dispute may then be submitted, as a whole, for arbitration#” among tne disputes solvable by arbitration, in general / are, it is considered, those which are connected witn the interpretation of a treaty or with any of the subjects of tne International law or with the evidence of any event the affiliation oi. which involves infringement of an International guarantee and/or with ti*e amoujut and kind of the indemnity required for similar infringement# Besides tue foregoing, His Highriess Shaikh Ahmad el Jabir el Sabah is one of the defendants and it lias already been agreed and recognised by the Govt.of Iraq that he is tne Ruler of an independant Emirate protected by Great Britain and, by virtue of kiiis position ana standing duly recognised by tue Govt#of Iraq, ne enjoys all tne international privileges usually enjoyed by tae Kings and Presidents of the Nations, hence it is not appropriate that he should undergo litigation personally nor can he be litigated in an ordinary court, but any matter arising between him and a certain State or individuals of certain State should be solved through tae political methods• Objection may perhaps be raised^to our foregoing statement, that the present suit is coiuiected witi* a private ptopertj owned in Basrau by Ills Highness tne Shaikh of k u waxt ana not owned ^y him under the capacity of^the Shaikh of Kuwait but is owned *^y hia as an ordinary individual# ;uch objection, if a^y, Jiaist be regarded as incorrect as H#H# 'The Shaikh of /.. t3 wait is aa president of an independaiit Emirate and wnen acquiring a property in different States nis act could not in way be regarded as having departed or assigned his personality as the Huler of an independaiit Emirate* As already pointed out, the Govemuent of Great Britain had guaranteed the properties in Basrah of H*H* Shaikh, his sons and grandsons* Great Britain, by giving tnis guarantee, was not an ordinary individual but is a Government enjoying similar concessions as tiiose of tne otdier Governments by virtue of their mutual relations* Therefore the internationality of tills suit, if not based on tne personality of H.H.T^e Shaikh of Kuwait, must be considered as based on the guarantee of Great Britain to the Bhaikii of Kuwait in respect of tne property in question, and, on this State we have to base our statement that tne suit, by virtue of this adaption, is outside tne competence of this Court (1) Owing to the position of tne defendants from tne general point of view, (2) by virtue of tne guarantee of Great Britain, (3) by virtue of tue provisions of tne Alliance Treaty concluded between Great Britain ana tne Iraqi Kingdom in 1-20, and, particularly by virtue of tne provisions of Articles 9 ana 10 oi this Alliance* DEFENCE BY PBEBCBlPTIOh* Before discussiii iv the relations of tnis defence with the subject of the present suit, it is considered advisable to lay before tne Court tne legal procedures applicable to the defence by prescription* It is interesting to observe that most of the Laws provide the devolution of the rights in the event of prescription and particularly tne Muslims Law on which principles the Iraqi Laws were enacted as the luslims Law, although do not provide for the devolution of rights for tne oldness thereof, disallows tne hearing of tne suit in the event of prescription#8 ~ Article lu60 of the n ;

It is further considered that should the opinion of ShaKir ei Hanhili, stipulating that the reason of appropriation should be ie^.iti«iate, he correct, there would be no necessity for defence on the grounds of prescription as wnen Uie reason of appropriation is legitimate it would alone be sufficient ensugh to defeat hue claim ©i the plaintiff for the substance. The Iraqi Court of Cassation nutfiaowever a moderate opinion as they had resolved in suit M 0 *251/926 a certain procedure published in 'hajallat el hdliya** (tne fagaasine of the Ministry of Justice) in its fourth edition of ti.e second year (page 100 ) where they saids- w The hearing of defence regarding the disposal, duriiig Uie prescription, in connection witn a property registered under a valid deed is not admissible unless the defence for prescription is uased on a certain reason of appropria tion by virtue of a written document 1 *. After having laid a own these opinions and definitions covering the procedure of prescription we now a ish to discuss txiO facts of tne present suit to sea whether tnese facts, as enumerated in the statement of tne suit mid according to the facts established in tne documents, allow tue hearing of Uie suit or tne court is disallowed to near the same by virtue of the prescription of 16 years* In the statement of the suit the plaintiff alleges that he owns an inheritance from his paternal aunt Awaaha Khaaum l/Lc^ hint, / bdulla A1 Zuhair msd is being one tuira of tne whole date trees situated at Fadaghiya at fao Kahia and registered at Tapu in her name unaer serial Ho *94, 95, 96 and 97 during January 1324 (perman nt) aiid under H®#11 aiid 12 of August 1916 (permanent) said has baaed his statement on tne grounds of the legal partition dated 31st December 1951 as well as on the Tapu records abovementisned, He then stated that the defendants had appropriated tx.e saae property ana are objecting to his ownership therein* He further indicated that Hamad and Abdulla s/o Shaikh 1 %’oarak el Sabah and Jabir, Salem anaNaasir s/o ShaiU, ./uDara/. el Safrafc tiie legators of u*e oumr dieteudaxits fosuX ottalnedl tiie #aiE# Xsi an unlawful miKcuit&amp;r arid by illegal deeds given in taeir nair.ea under H 0 .13, 14, 15, It, 17 and 18 of August 1916* The statement of U*e plaintiff covers two points ( 1 ) That the defendants are denying his property and ( 2 ) that this denial took place, in his opinion, since ugust 1915. men referring to tne date of t*a application of the suit it will be found that he had only raised his suit before U*e Courts, claiming for this property, on 20th October 1932 arid thus it will be revealed tkmi, over 15 years have lapsed since tae defena&amp;nis have appropriated the property in question - which is the specified period on expiry of which tne hearing of the suit becomes disallowed* On referring to tne legal partition dated 31st December 1931 it will be seen that tue death of Aesha bint Abdulla el guhair, the legatoress of the plaintiff, two months before tne date of tne partition is evident i*e. she died on 21 st October 1931 hence tne period between the date, alleged by the plaintiff f s attorney in the application of the suit to be the date of appropriation of the property by tne defendants, and tne date of t. : e death of Aesna el mohair y t^e Isgatorcss of tue plaintiff, exceeds 15 v , ears which is U*e legal period for tx^e non hearing of tne suit* Therefore the right for tne hearing' of tlie suit having xapaed before the death 0 f the lego tore ss and tue estate haviixg been transferred to the neire^s of el Zun&amp;ir, among whm is tue plaintiff, hence there oe in 0 no rignt for ti*e of this suit as it is $&amp;€h. by a person who have no legal quality to file tue said suit* #hen considering the facts of the suit in the light of the various views dealing witn tue reasons of appropriation it will be revealed 'that tnese facts are involved by ail tne opinions and preclude tne hearing of the suit*If we attribute tne appropriation by tiia dei'eaaants to tue extortion this will preclude tne nearing oi the suit by prescription.

Therefore, and, in view of these instruments the Tapu Deed in respect of the land was given in tne name of the sons who also have another deed covering the trees which are included in the sale aiid so toe property has been registered in the names of Jab ir, S&amp;lem, Ha sir, Atoad and Abdullah a/o Shaikh Mubarak Pasha el Sabah. These were the stages and circumstances of tae saxe in question but it has been indicated in tue application of Um plaintiff’s suit that these aeeds were illegal without pointing out the reasons of their invalidity. It is believed that he attempts to say that tne same were not concluded in conformity with the Tapu Regulation or, in the other word, Uie agreement is not an official one i.e. the offer and acceptance of tae sale aas not been made before an Officer duly authorized to perform tnis transaction* This what we believe our litigant (tne plaintiff) may wish to say as he did not mention in his application the reason for the invalidity of the deeds of ownership in possession of the defendants and that he must have based this opinion on the fact that the offer and acceptance in respect of tiie a 0 reenient of* sale should have been made before an authorized officer, a matter which has never been stipulated by most of tne laws of many nations. The sale in Ugypt, ior instance, is to be carried out hj mutual agreement which does not provide any other action and similarly in France and also in tue Islamic Laws as the sale and purchase of absolute property is within the special rights granted to imividuals with entire liberty arid is being one of the transactions which, made liable to special formalities under the haws, would oe handicappedand this conilieta with this oconoiiiicnl re qu xr&amp;ni^n'ts whicn caiX iai* &amp;11 ^esputcii ^order to s&amp;fe^u&amp;rci tii# in'terests ao much required 0 / the economic iiule• there are some transactions which are subject to fortml actions as provided by many of the Laws 9 such as the mort^.a^.e in Egypt arid France ai.d the sale 01 Govt, properties and tne properties rendered as »taqf* in an Incorrect maimer in Iraq and tne marriage as well. The factors involving the liability of tnese transactions to formal actions are apparent e.g# the marriage which provides that the lineage should first be proved whilst this proof is ti.e right of others, but tu% liability of marriage to formal actions has only tahen place recently in Egypt. And likewise the mortgage which involves severe consequences such as the dispossession of tne mortgager, and the liability thereof to formal action is with a vie^ to allowing ample tine to tiie aortager to think of his fate. This is also detrimental and would lead to tae abandonment of tne mortgage of property by tne mortgager. In tills connection Shaitir el Hand ill, tae viewer of the Lands Law had, in his views on this subject, $aias~ M It is doubtless tnat tne perfojmance of the sale, gifts and mortgages at ti*e fhakani Depts. and tne issue of a Khakani deed to ti.e purchaser, Donee and mortgagee is very beneficial from the point of view of the regularity of transactions, but hue non acknowledgment of these transactions wnen performed outside tne Khakani Dept, and tue disallowance of tiie Judges to hear the suits respecting properties not bound by a Khakani deed or, in the other word, the application of tne transactions in respect of Govt* lands to the properties calls for consideration from the point of view of the contravention thereof to the 3h&amp;ra f a provisions. It is possible to adopt special provisions to govern the disposal of Govt, lands so as to conform with the interests of the Treasury since the surveillance thereof is entrusted to the latter. But absolute properties are governed by the ihura * a Laws* as the ^Dajalia” provides that every person may dispose off his property at his discretion but provided tn&amp;t he should not injure the properties of others and that the agreements duly given by the respective owners are valid. Therefore the sale, gift and mortgage of properties outside tne Khakani Dept, is in order from the Shura 1 provisions point of view and tne non hearing of suits by the jhnr'a and Civil Courts wfcxi&amp;g respecting disputes taking plsice between the seller and tne purchaser, the Denar aixa Donee, the aortgager and mortgagee in connection with properties as well as the non issue of judgment, pursuant upon the confession of thelitigant, owing to tu% non-hearing of tne suit would lead to tue devolution of rights and tne departure frou, the purpose aimed at froia tne introauetion of tne Law 11 * It would therefore be observed ti*at the performance of tne formality which U&amp; litigant attempts to allege as having been omitted in tne title deeds in possession of tne defendants is not Justified by any reason whatsoever. Moreover, has this formality been stipulated against tue contracting parties or, in the other word, is it necessary that the acceptance should, squally to the offer, be performed before an authorized officer ? It is theoretically agreed in several Laws suca as in France and Egypt taat tne offer is to be performed 'before tne Government Officer as tne seller is the one who is relinquishing his property duly registered in his name and transferring tue same to others. This has been specifically provided in the Egyptian and French laws in connection with the mortgage of an estate. As regards the acceptance, saae can be made in any form even by tne use of the standardized form confirming tne offer of the mortgager as if being submitted by We mortgagee creditor for registration. We would also like to point out in this statement that tne non-compliance with the stipulation regarding We formalities respecting the agreements and tne registration thereof does not affect in any way We contracting parties, but any snortcoming effect in these actions would be apparent amongst two individuals having under dispute the place in which the agreement has ta&amp;en place. This has been observed by almost all laws arid even in Iraq as on 5tn July 1919 the Acting Ccmmander-in-Chisf, Iraq Expeditionary Forces had issued Motification,Article 3 of which reads as follows:.M nevert. elees, if person sells nis absolute property by an ordinary deed not registered and it tnen appears that ne or nis heirers ana/or Agent had solo or fiiortga^ed tx.at property tfitn another person who nad registered ti*e s&amp;o.e in tne Tapu Dept, without knowing of tne existence of in© ojrainnr^ deed the latter will not be executed on tne possessor of tne registered deed.” The Irani Govt, had on IBtn April 1922 introduced a Law designated as M Law governing the xxaaxxjba.t.xxx Unregistered dales and Transfers* Article t of which reads as follows i» r, Any sale or final transfer and/or conditional transfer sxiail not be executed against a person who is entitled to a land by virtue of another agreement given by the game seixer or transferer or by his heirera or transferees if tne other agreement had been duly registered at the Tapu Dept# without knowing any thing about the previous unregistered agreement * 11 Likewise tne Egyptian Govt, had enacted a Law for the registration of agreements of this nature i.e. Law K 0 .1B and 19 of 1923 article 1 of which reads as follows *~ tt Ali agreeMents^conciuded y fey against a substitute or otherwise and which provide tne establishment of a right of ownership or a ri&amp;ht of ethex* estate property or tne transfer, alteration and/or the elimination thereof as well a© tne final judgments covering such a condition should be declared by having tue same registered at tne office oi the Preliminary Court where tne estate is enrolled or at the Shara Court, with due regards to the provisions in force at present in connection with the concessions, mortgage of estate© and estate allotments''. M The non- registration provides txiat tne above rights siiall not take effect, nor it be transferred, altered _ and/or eliminated neither among tne eontr&amp;ctxng parties nor in comparison with others and non registered agreements shall have no effect out tne personal undertaking© be tween tne contracting parties the provisions of this article are regarded as a ^ restriction to tne provisions goveiTiiiig the transfer of ownership and other rights oi estate substance by the mere offer am acceptance between tne contracting parties*• n against this Law ti*e Egyptian uourt oi Cassation ©aids- *Thc aureement of sale is one or U&amp; mutual agreements which concludes and takes effect uy the mrst acceptance of both parties* The only invention introduced by tne HListration Law in respect thereof is that the transfer of ownership, after having been regarded as essential result for tne proper sale a© provided by tne provisions of para Cl) Article 2tt of tnc Civil haw on aaving the same concluded by an agreement, it has now become loose until after tne registration. The other proviaion© of tue sale are still in force and have never been revoxeu4 '»26— * 0 j tiie i &amp;kr&amp;Xion 1 &gt;b.w as 'tiie seller recmina Oovuid* oy virtue oi tte agreement, to nand over tne sale ana tne transfer of ownership to tm purchaser whilst tne latter remains bound to pay the value etc. as mutually agreed to by the mere conclusion of the agreement * M It will be seen from the above provisions that the Scale wuIX 2 iOt be null anci void when riot fulfilling these its formal formalities but %uxs effect becomes loose, as indicated by the Egyptian Court of Cassation, pending completion of tue said formal formalities between the contracting parties alone • as regards tliose who nave under dispute a property not transferred, toe party who having fulfilled those formal formalities before his competitor will be given preference as delineated above. This procedure is not of tne day as it has been said before tnat M wn© he endeavours to revoke what has been done by him his endeavours snail reflect on him'. We now wish to discuss t:.e following matter hid the laws in Iraq really provide tnat the offer and acceptance in respect of the sale of absolute lands should be performed before an authorised officer or not ? h-e have perused certain legal books which deal with this matter and were all found to be stipulating the same without showing the origin of that opinion. Ve nave also referred to tne Laws governing;, tae sale of immoveable properties and particularly the haw governing tne disposal of Immoveable properties and have observed that Article 1) Uicreof provides as follows H /^ll transactions relating to Govt.Lands aiid ” ,aqf** Lands should be performed at tna Office of the Khakani .Depts• only and t/*« disposers tiiereof be fc iven a i h&amp;kani deed, ana, whereas tne disposal without a title deed is disallowed, the hearing of a suit by tne fh&amp;ra'a arid Civil Courts and the performance of the transaction at tne Govt.depts. in respect of lands for which no K^akani dead is produced is likewise prohibited should it happen at the places where ti.e document and demarcation have been performed in accordance with tiie new Law'.It appears from Urn provision of this article that the same apply to the transactions relating to G 0 vt* Laiids ana -a.' i lands and did not provide anytiiing about tae absolute property, therefore, tae liability of the latter to the provisions of this ai*ticie is beyond tae definitions thereof* It would oe understood tram the expression (as the disposal without a need is disallowed hue hearing of...*.* is likewise prohibited) tnat the saae alludes to the disposal of absolute property, but this comprehension is wrong as toe disposal alluded to by this article, according to this expression, is tiie specific disposal referred to in Ui© beginning of this article i.e. tu*e traiisactions relating to Govt, lands and waqf lands* When referring to the Regulation desigiiated as (Tapu Regulation - form of tne Ha,, i ayoni deed - to be complied with accordingly) it will be observed tuat rticie ( 1 ) thereof provided as follows*.- H Whereas tue Revenue Officers l*e* toe haftardara, U*e sfudix* ei al arid tne y l3 dirs of the w aduas are authorised to grant reclteatione ana accept tenders in respect of Govt.lands in outside stations they should therefore be regarded equally to tne owner of the land**. It will also be seen tnat the provision of this article refers to Govt, lands onl^• Article (3) begins also with tne following (If any one intends to relinquish a land etc) and it is intuitively understood that relincuiehing does no o take place in connection with absolute property. , All the foregoing provisions do not in any way provide tne necessity of obtaining Tapu deeds for absolute property and, although the sa ■ &amp; are beneficial therefor and render tiie absolute property subject to Tapu Regulation, they do not repeal these agreements but, as provided in tne Egyptian Law, defer the traces thereof pending fulfilment of these formal formalities.The abovementione* Laws and Regulations all provide . V that a suit in respect or the property should not be neard but Uiey do not however define the revoking of the agreement. In this connection we would like to point out tnat, under this dispute, we are only defendants and not plaintiffs. It is also desired to discuss tae origin of this succession since we are unable to find out any trace for it in these Laws, i.e. tue necessity tuat tne xlkiaar offer and acceptance should be aaade before a co ape tent Officer* We have already referred, in our discussion, to tne resolutions of the Iraqi Court of Cassation and it oM % . was found that tiiese resolutions provide that tiie sale of iimioveable properties outside tne kh&amp;k&amp;ni Dept, is not valid and these resolutions were based on the provisions of article (1) of the Law governing the disposal of immoveable property and tne Ko^&amp;l Warrant issued in September 1318. These resolutions firstly provide, in general, 'tne sale of L...movable properties’** Rut it is not understood whether hnis expression covers toe sale of absolute properties or other property. Since, however, tne sane resolutions have been based on the provisions of article (1) of the Law governing the disposal of immoveable property which article governs the Govt* property and the Waqf Lands only, these resolutions must therefore be referring to this kina ox property only. But tne resolutions in question had also referred to tne Royal arrant issued in September 1318 and though we tried to refer to the text of tnis warrant no trace was made of this text. We have been able to trace the Instructions issued by the Minister of Interior to the dilayets in execution of this Warrant. 3n referring to tne provisions of these Instructions and although, it is appreciated, that tne sane nave not tixe sa .e legal effect, but it has been found tnat these Instructions provide as follows—29*» 'Pursuant upon U±% issue of a Royal Warrant disallow. the courts to hear suits tahltyg place between two parties | 0 !«m for proving tne sale aiid ourcuase executed on ordinary documents, tne disposers ex'* properties should be advised ti.at they must hasten to obtain tae necessary deeds and U,e sarae be also broadcast throughout the Wilayet by iaeans 01 local papers and otaer methods^ • It seems from the contents of these Instructions that the latter do not revoke tne agreements but simply disallow the hearing of tne suit, whilst the difference between the revoking of the agreement and the disallowance of the hearing of tne suit is great. Hevertneless, do the defendants in this dispute lack Tapu needs ? The late Shaikh Muharak ei Saban had purchased these properties from Abdul Waiiab pasha ei Qirt&amp;ss, as being Agent of ...esi.a KRanum el Sul'mir, in 1327 and subsequently correspondence were exchanged between him ana the Sublime Porte and the matter took a political shape until Great Britain occupied Basraii Wilayet. In this corresponuenc e the Sublime Porte had recognised the correctness of the sale of these properties and issued instructions for the registration thereof at tne Tapu Department as shown in the letter of tne wall of Basraii in 1328,as indicated above, but the same has not been executed for some political factors which we need hardly mention herein although the letter of the tali of Basraii above-mentioned alludes to tne same reasons indirectly who indicated that dijharram Kff, his predecessor, nad BQnm omm *..... I.. in these political factors. The mat er lias thus remained lingering until Great Britain occupied Basrah and, after having organized her affairs therein, sue discussed toe question of the ownership of H.H. The Shaikh as sue was in previous touen with him In this respect and the British Governuent had resolved that tne sale was in order. Subsequently, the Director of Finance Hr.Henry Dobbs nad issued orders to tne Tapu Dept, for the registration of this property in the names of the owners thereof i.e. the legators oft«ii© @iiciiuil&gt;s * ‘ 1 liB of* %lm Tiipu o.©^&lt;i sk&amp;M already been outlined above. Objection may periiapa be raised to tne incorrectness 01 course oi action but tnis objection is out of* uie question, as Great Britain wnen occupying Basraii as invader and sue has to organize matters in the lands occupied by ner at her own discretion. Therefore, the Coriander in Chief of the Occupation Troops had issued circular during August 1915 covering tne organization of matters in the occupied country and designated the same as tt Tiie o cup led Iraq Country Law 11 . Chapter 6 of this haw unaer the heading i, Mlscellaneou 8 n part 4 ? reads as follows w The Courts established by virtue of this Law shall not adopt the Ottoman Venal laws nor anything connected witn the evidence of the Laws or the Ottoman Civil Laws”. Whereas Great Britain navin 0 been irwader State she has to regularize matters in Iraq as she may deem suitable, hence the officials were not receiving their power from the provisions of the Laws but from the instructions received from the Commander-in-Chl*f or his representative, the r olitical Officer or hia representative. Therefore, tne officials of the Tapu Dept. Basrai* had received written instructions from the Director of Finance, Mr.Henry Dobbs, to have these properties registered in the names of the sons of H.H.T^e Shaikh of Kowait and nave executed ti*e same order accordingly. The agreements actually in existence at tne time but not registered were not treated by the * awe as invalid ana the latter Laws allowed the registration thereof in tne names of the respective owners. The said Laws stipulated however that no rights of otriers should be effected on tire registration thereof. Among these Laws is the notification issued by the Coiamander-in-Chief in 19ID as well as the Law introduced by the Iraqi G 0 vt. in 1922 which all definitely provide ( 1 ) the non revoking of agreements concluded outside tne Tapu Dept, and (g) thepower granted to tne Coiijmnder-in-Chief Umn allows tnis course of action not by virtue of %m provisions of tiie Law but because &amp;ue was an invader State# All Authors agree that Ui» acts of the officials of tiie invader Govermieiit are to be conaidered in order and a^aong those Autiiors is Ahamd Hashaat Beg the Law professor of tae Royal Egyptian Law School who, in his book known (Rissalat el Itnbat Fi el Taahudat), said:- 'When a lawful Govt* becomes conquered and tlie extorting Govt, appoints an official the latter correspondence should be considered as official correspondence as he is an official in reality. If we consider his acts as invalid tnis would lead to the hindrance of the people*s interests and paralyses the operations due to the absence of otner person. Such an official when writing any document tne same would cover the people*s interests or embodies certain Civil obligations against the people - which obligations must be esteemed particularly when the preparation of agreements being made merely on the mutual desire and discretion of tne contracting parties as it is doubtless that it ialt^e public aaci private interest tu regard such documents and agreements as ofticial oms* According to tne Islamic Shara ^aw, tne J t ,dgruent of tne Qadhi appointed by the invader Autaor'ity is to be treated as in order**. This is bving the saiae opinion of the English Author (Goodnow) in his book (Tne Comparative Administration Law) edition (2) page (26) unaer the heading •Office de Factor 1 *. It will therefore be gathered from the foraging that the claim of ti.e plaintiff is groundless from all aspects and snould he rejected. In spite of our confidence in our safe situation in this suit it is imperative on us to mention something about the mode of service of tue process of 'this suit on the defendants, as this has been carried out illegally. The Civil Procedure Code provides that service of any process should be raade on the defendant or his attorney, whilst ti^e plaintiff car^e forward with this suit in 1932 4 M failed to hme the ia..,e served on t^e defendaxit because they reside in an independant Emirate far away from the Government of Iraq. H.H# A^aad el Jauir el Sabah the Shaikh of Kuwait had appointed one of us (Abdul Jelil rartow) as his attorney to see certain matters but hisf power of attorney did not autnoriae the s aid Advocate to plead in this case, specifically, but in fact the power of attorney had prevented him from the right of accepting the service of any process ana, in the otner legal sense of tue word, H*H*Th© Shaikii did not allow tiie discretion to the Advocate in person or his office to allow the service on him and has evidently prevented him from this in tne said power of attorney hence the service in this case is beyond these definitions (1) because the Advocate in question has not been a ppointed to plead in this case but has been appointed to act in other cases ( 2 ) in this power of attorney he has been prevented from accepting any service* The Court haviiit, decided tne litigation of H*H*T^e Shaikh on the grounds of a Telegram sent by K*K# to the president of the Court on the understanding that this telegram is being in acknowledgment of the service on H*H* the Shaikfi whic** is incorrect, as tne wire did not cover such expression or a word which could toe treated as comprehended by the court besides the fact that, as enumerated above, the abovementioned advocate is not an attorney in this case and is prevented from accepting any service. In addition to tne above the case was fixed for hearing on 5th January 1938 but on that date the case was postponed for scrut ini nation and fixed for 12th January 1938 but the court did not resolve the nearing of tne case against H.H.the Shaikh* On 12tn January the case was adjourned for 15/1/38, due to the absence of tne President, without resolving the hearing thereof # On 15th January 1938 the Court resolved the hearing of tne case by default, a matter which is absolutely in contravention to the Law as article 144 (amended) provides that tne hearing can be resolved to be made by default when the defendant fails to attend on the day fixed for trial and that if, on tne said date, thehearing by default is not resolved, against Uie defendaii't and hue case is adjourned for obiter dabe, for so-.n* reason or another, another summons siiould then be issued to hue defendant* In tnis case the court had adjourned tue suit twice eu.d did not resolve hue trial of ti.e case by default and, in the hnird instance, tne court heal’d tne case by default whilst tn® defendant has never been served by any means, whatsoever, to attend on 16th January 1S3B hence tiie said actions should oe regarded as null and void and no service should be considered as having been received by the defendants* The matter did not end at tnis sta^e but the court nad fixed the hearing on 23/1/38 and this has ’been promulgated in the papers which is another illegal action, as the notice to oe only published in ti.e local papers when the residence of the defendant is unknown whilst tne residence of Uie defendants in this case could not be considex*ed as unknown and it is considered that these actions ai'e illegal and we are reluctantly compelled to nave the same enumerated nere with a view to fulfilling the bearings of the defence in tnis case* In the circumstances we insist upon our claims that tne suit of the plaintiff Should oe rejected and tne service process be likewise cancelled and tue plaintiff be made liable to aset all court fees plus tne honorary fees including tiie staii of ID. 11/250 being tne fees for tne drawing up of this statement* Attorneys )£ tne Defendants, th/«i/38 *t i To, Through Political .agency, Kuwait.

The defence of the defendants are framed in four points and they are: - The duty of the court, The passage of CiTil Time, which they preteM* The passage of the Indian time, and She origin of the case, let th© duty of the Court . In their defence, the defendants in this personal case put before the Court th© reason that Britain is protecting Kuwait, which they think that will extricate tneta from this lawful case, Ttiey say that Kuwait cam© under the British protection on 3rd hovemoer 1913, and. tnat the agreomsnt of protection also guarantees the properties of Shailch Mubarak as-3ubah In Basra. They, in this my, try to put a new obstacle in this case, and also they avoided the service of the documents of the case for many years. This case is one of the several personal oases put up to prevent the intervention with an immovable property situated in Iraq,, This is a pure personal case between individuals, and there is nothing to Justify the defendants in claiming it as a political or International one. If we carefully ©xamina the guarantee, which the defendants state, has been given by the British Government, and find it valid and executive, thex~*j jAr' the defendants could only claim whatever they loss from that Government, If they go carefully through the wording of that letter | they would find it incomplete as regards the undertaking to Shaikh Muharak*® non-payment of tax on liis properties« To uphold to it {the guarantee] wou3d mean to usurp the rights of others aid their properties t which is imlawful from the point of view of the Governments * 1mm and rights. There is nothing in the laws of the world which gives the right to any Government giving any person the property of other (person), if an agreement concluded between the British Government and Shaikh Mubarak, this does not affect the residents of the ottoman Country and their properties there. The Laws in the Ottoman country are not subjected to any opposition. As regards what the agent of the defendants allege that the Iraqi Government want to touch their rights (the defendants*), which is a strange thing and an attack (towards the Government), and this should not be put before the Justice. The British Govemaent could interfere with the Kuwait affairs, within the borders of the Emirate, and the Shaikh has not to ask an Iraqi Court for the interference of the British Government in a private case before an Iraqi Justice. However if m submit and say there is an agreement concluded between Shaikh Mubarak and the British Government, according to an extract from letter dated 3/11/14 presented to m by the agents of the defendants, and if we go through it, we would find a word *.rwamx* (asadows), which means thethe meadows possessed, while the pi*oporties in question| are not Shaikh Mubarak*s nor his heirs* at any time, and this (property) does not coma wider this letter, which only refers to what the Shaikh Abdulla, Jabir, Hasir and Salim, in a time when they were not Eulers or Bmirs, but were ordinary persons i*e* during i^halkli Mubarak as-Subah*s reign* 'mis property has not any connection with what Shaikh Mubarak aa-Subah possessed or to have it possessed., because it was not left by Mm or he left it to his heir©, and ho did not possess It at all* If the British guarantee is proper, which if recourse! to, the case does not come under it at all* connection with this case, so they should not be brought before the Courts* the defendants Ahmad al-Jabir, the Bnlr of Kuwait, and requests that the case to be taken up as a government *s case* The status of Ahmad al-Jabir in this case 1© as one of the defendants in this ordin and legal case* He, Mmself, has filed many suit© and he still files against the individuals in Iraq before the same Courts and through the same agent Abdul-Jalil Xartu* Many Judgements were passed aga him, and among which one was under Ho*930/77, which was appealed and passed under Wo* 1932/66 in connect with a. property in the Faddaghiyah State, l*e. in b sane state, which the defendants allege, included in iijj possessed* Besides the persons who intervened ansi registered it in their names, and they are Hamad, The agent of the defendants says that amon The Anglo-Iraq treaties have not any» /gl/1 %®£{ &amp;*3£&amp;&amp;¥JteM ^ ^' ■ • ■ '^ $ *wmf ton. i&amp;r.\u ***$&amp; vx* ■ mx&amp;tw yiw^yt Tife 8 stoaW(X * .^v.. ^•s®.o^ ' vred^ Jto? i'&amp;bs&amp;il &amp;* ** ' * ' ' ' ' ' -:-•. -.. , ftlMi® w£*f&amp;&amp; ./&gt;,*i &amp;$£w mltmmov W *taxi mti ot£2 m to 3*mmm€ tm^^m i&amp;m&lt;M t*&amp;* &amp;d to ®l&amp; ~£ $$s€ tm w * $k - 9 M^m^so^. ,XXa •** i.ts if ;••;-&gt; . •- ‘l-c ^!i£t ^ #1 ^ f'c;—; t ^s cn &gt; t t .

My Lord, / With reference to m? letter (176/4,/m) of March SBM, to Mr. Baggallay, I have the honour to report that the efforts which have been mm® to persuade the Ministry of foreign affairs to aiaend paragraph 5 of the draft reply to Mr. Bateman* a letter to hurl Pasha of July 8 th, 1956 (Bo. 54?) relative to the application of land settlement procedure to the properties of the Shaikh of Koweifc in Iraq, have unfortunately proved fruitless. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and hie departmental officials have from the outset maintained that the Ira^i law imposes a number of restrictions on the ownership by foreigners of tapu (i.e. mirl land granted in Taou ) property in Iraq. Pressed to quote the law on which thia assertion is based, they have produced, after a long delay. Article 110 of the Ottoman Land Code (I enclose a copy of this Article taken from ff Ottoman hand Laws* by Stanley Fisher, M.AI Hiimphrey Milford 1919). They have explained, that the exerts in the government departments have assured them that this Article makes it Impossible for the Iraqi Government to give, in full, the assurance for which they were asked in the last sentence of paragraph 8 of the note of July 1936. 5. We have argued that such an interpretation of thl Article is inconsistent with the existing procedure, whereby foreigners are given title for teiovable properties, subject only to the consent of the Minister of the Interior or, in special cases, of the Council of Ministers. We have pointed out that there i Eight Honourable The Viscount Halifax, &amp;.G., 0.0.8.1., 0.0.1.M., etc., etc., etc. I1 5, , 2 there la nothing in this Article of the Land Cods which provides a reason for the dimerlmiimtion which la made in the draft i^eply to the note of July 1936, between the grant to the Shaikh of title for mx£k and for faim property, md we have urged that, in any event, Article 110 does not apply to the Shaikh’s properties as, although some of them may have been acquired by one or other of his forebears while technically an Ottoman subject, the present Shaikh, Ahmad al Jabir, mat, at the tine he inherited the properties, have been of the same nationality as the man from whom he inherited them* All these efforts, have however, failed to move the Ministry* 4* Shaikh Ahmad, succeeded hie uncle, Balia, in February 1981, before the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne. It would seem, therefore, that he inherited or at any rate cmm into effective possession of, the properties in question while he was an Ottoman subject, and the if ini® try of Foreign affairs have been ‘unable to refer to any law or treaty which prevents ex-Ottomans, who have acquired nationality other than Iraqi under the Treaty of Lausanne, from continuing to own iwnovable property of which they were in possession before they ©eased to he Ottoman subjects* For example, there seems to be nothing to prevent an ex-Ottoman, now a Syrian, from remaining in possession of property which he owned in Iraq before the War. The ministry however, have stuck obstinately to their point and say that they cannot go further to meet our wishes than the wording of paragraph 5 of their draft 5. ' On their side it must, in fairness, be admitted that Article 110 of the Land Code does suggest the possibility of complications concerning the Shaikh’s title which do not seem hitherto to have been fully considered. For example, the promise given to shaikh Mubarak In 1914 guarantees ownership of hie i: ■I IWii his garuenis in Iraq to hi© d©®aerj&amp;©ai©* But it do©© not promise tlxat the oworship shall be vested in hia succeaaors. Mubarak was succeeded by hU eldeat son, but Jabir was followed by his brother, and Ahiaed is the nephew of Salim* 3 © that there is room for difficulties in 'the matter of inheritanee* 1 ^ position in regard to th# right of foreigner ® ^ acquire j)roperty in Iraq is, 00 far as quxi b© ascertained, tliat set out in paragraph 2 of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s despatch Ho. 286 of duly 14th, 1937, and I suspect that it is tho council of Sinister’s resolution of 1934 referred to therein which is the real obstacle to the Iraqi Govorikioiit agreeing to give the assurance asked for in paragraph 8 of Mr* Bateman 1 a note of July 1936* 7* I observe, however, that the Oomiander-in-Ohief * © Proclaimtion ho* m of July both, 1919, deals with the alienation of imovable property to foreigners, whereas the Council of Minister © 1 resolution of 1934 (of which there is unfortunately no copy in tho archives of this Bmbaasy) is said to restrict the ownership of property by foreigners to purpose© of residence only. Kven if it is assumed that the word 'ownership' is intended here to have the same meaning as 'alienation' in I-roolamatian Ho* 38 the Proclaimtion itself provides no explicit ground for restricting permission to house property and it .may be the fear that the legality of the resolution will be challenged which has deterred the Iraqi authorities from quoting It as the Justification for the foimnila adopted in paragraph 6 of the draft note under discusaion* It will be recalled that house property (other than w nqf ) is usually classified as mulk . It must also be noted that the Proclamation says nothiiig about the grant of title to foreigners for property to which they can establish a claim (other than that of acquisition after the data of 1 ^-of t»li® l-Toelainaticm } f uxiloss It can toe argued ttoat suoh grant would, in law, toe alienation toy the Oovermnent. There is, moreover, the Turkish 'Law aiding Foreigners the Eight to Eos seas litmovatole Property in the Ottoman empire 11 of 7th L&amp;f&amp;r, 1EB4 (as© page 57 of Stanley ?iaher f s work quoted above), which was not abrogated in Iraq until the coming into fore© in June 1931 of the 'Personal Status -aw' (see Compilation of i&amp;w&amp; for 1931 page 143). It could possibly toe argued that the shaikh should be given title under the Law of 7th Safer because he owned the land before it was repealed! on the other hand, it could perhaps toe equally well maintained that Article 18 ( 8 ) of the Personal Status Law prevents the grant of title under the Law of 7th Safer, at any date after the coming into fore© of the Personal status Law itself• a. Xn these circumstances of legal uncertainty and oonfusio: I have been considering whether it might not toe advisable for His Majesty 9 e Government to accept the formula proposed toy the Iraqi Government* subject to the reservation toy His Majesty’s Government of all rights concerning the effect of the Lhsikto 1 a non-Iraqi status on the question of the grant to him of tapu deeds for properties awarded to him by the hand Lettl©ment committee. The disadvantages of talcing this course would bas te) That although, under the he facto practice described above (and setting aside the complications to which Article 110 might give rise In the matter of inheritance), the only bar to the grant of title to the Shaikh for properties awarded to .him toy Land Settlement is apparently the Council of Ministers 1 resolution of 1934, there- is no guarantee that when the time comes the Council of Ministers would be willing to instruct the Tapu office to grant the Shaikh title for any tout mu Ik properties# Xn fact there seem® to toe a, consider able risk~ £ ~ risk that thsy wouX?! iK&gt;t agree to do so and would deTiss ■ v a variety of argument© to justify their re.fu©al. 0&gt;) I'hat# so for a© 2 have been able to find out f moet of the property now in the possession of the Shaikh is, or if swarded to him .would become, mlrl msxfmwmz* Tory little, if any, seems to be i^ojjg , though it is possible that the trees planted in the gardens may be milk {Article 26 of the Land cod©; but I feel unable to assoss what effect this additional complication jnay have on the Shaikh f a right to title a© a non-Ira-ai* (c) That in consequence of the considerations mentioned in (a) and (l&gt;), the proposed Land Settlement ;procedure might lead to a situation in which the Staikh of Koweit (or the Shaikh and other heirs of 3Mdi Mubarak) might be confirmed in their claim to the bulk of the properties which are now in their possession, but ho refused title for them. Such a situation might bring into prominence the whole question of the Shaikh* a right a© a foreigner to own property in Iraq whereas up to the present his right has only been contested by private individual® in respect of part of the properties* On the other hand, the advantages to be gained would be:- (a) That civil suits against the Shaikh (including the case now before the Oaurts about the Fadd&amp;ghiyah properties) would not be heard* (b) That full Information about the Shaikh*© properties (including survey plans) would at last be available, a result which, for many reasons, would bo a help toward© the final settlement of the question of ownership* (c) That .Land Settlement will, in any event, be applied{&amp;) Although tli© Iraqi GoveriMent are not willing to give in full the assurance asked for, they have not declare that title will not he given, for ta pu land, but only that i: this regard the law xm&amp;t be taken into account. The provisions of the law are not clear but, whatever they are, they cannot in the end be avoided and, provided that when run by allowing the matters to stand mm they are. (e) That the rest of the draft reply is satisfactory and, if the present opportunity to reach agreement about the appreciation of the position covers all contingencies, I feel that the balance of argument lies on the aide of the advantage a of accepting the draft and, subject to Your Lordship*a own vie%o, application of Land Settleimmt is allowed to pass, aiiother may not occur again. the time comes ti («le is net refused except in cases where the law so demands, the risks entailed in having Land Settlement applied now are probably leas than those which u Although I cannot pretend that the above summary- 7 *» will be in a position later on ahould title be refused to the Shaikh by a Council pf !.lilUstera , resolution or by a false inter pretation of the law, to bring pressure to bear on the Iraqi Government to change their attitude. I enclose a draft of a letter on these lines which I suggest l inight be authariaied to ©end to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to the letter ill which he cosmuxicate© to ims the docmmnt now under discussion. 10. In making the above reccaa^sndatlons, X m also bearing in mind the fact that Mr. Kdsn f in his telegram i&lt;o. 120 of July 4 th 1956, suggested the advisability of omitting the la#t sentence of paragraph 8 of the not© of July 8 th 1936, and that it therefore appears that Els Majesty’s Oovermaent mmj not wish to insist on obtaining the assurance to which that sentence refers. 11. After the long delays which have occurred, it la desirable that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be informed, a© soon as possible, whether or not lie Majesty*s Government would ba willing to accept the proposed reply to Mr. Batsman* s mots of July, 1938, and 1 accordingly request that I may be speedily informed of your wishes. 12.

Sir, The Lords Cciranissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury wilJ. toe aware, from semi-official correspondence that has recently passed between the Treasury, India Office and this department, that it has ueen considered des«retole to provide the present Sheikh of Koweit, at the expense of His Majesty’s Government, with expert legal assistance in connexion with a lawsuit tor ought in the Iraqi courts against him ana otner heirs of the late Sheikh Mibarak of Koweit in respect of one of the properties whose continued possess- -ion was guaranteed by His Majesty's Government in 1914 to Sheikh Mubarak and to his heirs ana successors. The expense forjwhich it nas been agreed to assume responsibility in this connexion are:- (a) A fee of £400, plus expenses, to an ■ Egyptian lawyer recommended by His Majesty's Ambassador at Cairo, who has recently visited Koweit irom Egypt in order to assist in the pre- -paration of tne Sheikh's case, ana (b) A fee, which it is anticipated will not exceed £130, for an Iraqi lawyer whoduring the actual hearing of the case at Basra (this latter expenditure will be in- -curred in the first instance by the » Political Agent at Koweit ana v/ill be recovered by the India Off ice in due course from the Foreign Office). 3. I uirected by discount t Ia ' 1 ifax to request that ^heir Lordships may be moved to u ive their formal sanction to the expenditure detailed above. As it is probable that very considerable further expenditure will be incurred in connexion with the pledge given in 1914, which covered the property in Iraq not only of Sheikh Mubarak but also of the late Sheikh Khazzal of Mohammerah, and as it would appear to be convenient to charge all the expenditure relating to this natter under one subhead, I am to suggest that the expenditure on legal assistance for the Shaikh of Koweit should be met from Subhead X (Special Missions) of the Dip- -lomtic and Consulate Vote, rather than from Sub- -head (?

Maltre Rushdi is anxious that copies of the English version of the 'conclusions' should be distributed as soon as possible to: The four copies required are accordingly enclosed herein and I should be grateful if, while retaining one, you could arrange for the onward transmission of the others* In the event of Your Excellency considering that it might embarrass the British President of the Court at Basra to receive this document from His Majesty’s Embassy direct, The President of the Court at Basra The Political Agent at Koweit.

Maltre Rushdi has also communicated copies of a translation of the further document which he prepared as a reply to the observations of the plaintiffs on his original memorandum or 'conclusions'. He has already sent this document in Arabic to Koweit in official form for the purposes of the case. Four copies of the English translation of this reply are also enclosed herein and I request that Your Excellency will be good enough to distribute them in the same manner as the 'conclusions'.

The pasha, who was profuse in expressions of regret at his 'inability” to go personally to Koy/eit, said that he had been into the matter fully with his substitute, Rushdy Bey, on the latter^ return from Koweit. He thought Rushdy Bey had performed an excellent piece of work, and that his 'conclusions' as to the legal situation were admirably drawn up and should suffice in an unbiassed Court to win the cases for the Sheikh. Doss Pasha then said that he was pretty certain not only that the Armenian lav/yers, whom the Sheikh has hitherto employed, were out to keep the litigation going (a fact which we had always realised in the Foreign Office, I think), but also that the Sheikh himself was anxious to los e, the cases so that he might draw compensation in hard cash from His Majesty’s Government! In any case, the pasha said, there was no doubt that the Sheikh’s cases had in the past been very badly prepared and handled in the Iraqi Courts, and the present cases would have been lost but for the intervention of the Egypt ion lav/yer. I understand that the present position is that the Court has adjourned the hearing so as to permit the claimants answer/ Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.l.answer RusMy Bey’s ’'conclusions 1 '.. Boss Pasha is, of course, naturally out to magnify the role of his Egyptian colleague, hut it is interesting that he should, spontaneously volunteer the point ahout the Sheikh wishing to lose the cases, X do not remember that we ever suspected the Sheikh of going quite as far as that.' Incidentally, Boss pasha said that if the cases eventually came up on Appeal to the Iraqi Court of Cassation he would be very happy to handle personally the Sheikh’s case. He did not, however, mention the fee he would ask for doing so’ Yours ever, (Signed) JACK WARB.Telegram k No. 198 hated 21st May, 1938 Prom Resident Bushire x o Political Kuwait.

A L &gt;908 H?V '1 OR: IGK OFFICE, 0 ,. . 1 . 3rd June» 1938, d*^ Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to invite a reference to Foreign Office letter E 1459/28/93 of the 22nd March enclosing a copy of a soni-official letter to this department from His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad regarding the properties in Iraq of the late Sheikhs of Kov/eit and Mohammerah. The Marquess of Zetland will recall that in this letter Mr „ Morgan enclosed the text of a draft note which had been prepared by the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in reply to Mr o Bateman’s note of the 8 th July, 1936, that Mr 0 Morgan expressed the opinion that, with the exception of paragraph 5, v/hich deals with the effect of the Sheikhs' non-Iraqi nationality on the registration of their properties, the draft seemed on the whole satisfactory, and that he was endeavouring to secure a redraft of paragraph 5 which would contain an assurance as to the miri as well as the muIk properties to which the Sheikhly families could be shown to have a valid claim. 2. From the enclosed copy of a despatch which has now been received from His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad it will be seen that the efforts of His Majesty’s Embassy to secure a redraft of this paragraph have unfortunately proved fruitless, but that Sir Maurice Peterson is inclined to/ The Under Secretary of India Office*V to think that on the whole the balance of argument is in favour of accepting the draft note as it stands, subject to the reservation by His Majesty’s Government of the right, in the event of the non-Iraqi nationality of the heirs of the two Sheikhs becoming an impediment in the grant to them of title deeds in respect of miri land awarded them by the Land Settlement Committee, to take the matter up with tho Iraqi Government through the diplomatic channel. 3. The legal grounds on which the Iraqi Government justify their refusal to give the desired assurance regarding miri lands are, as Sir Maurice Peterson says, very uncertain and confused. But Lord Halifax considers that no useful purpose v/ould be served by pressing them further at this stage to reconsider their decision,, Indeed, His Lordship fears that to do so , or to make enquiries of the Iraqi Government as to what course they would follow in the event of the land settlement authorities proving unable to grant title deeds for properties to which no one except the Sheikhly families could be shown to have any claim might only lead them to commit themselves more obstinately than hitherto to positions from which they would later find it difficult to withdraw. 4 . It seems to His Lordship that the immediate objective of His Majesty’s Government in this matter must be to arrange that the titles of the heirs of the two Sheikhs to the lands now in their possession may be examined, and if possible confirmed, at an early date. Once this has been achieved, and all other private claimants have been eliminated, it should prove possible to reach some agreement with/with the Iraqi Government which would satisfactorily safeguard the interests of tlae Sheikhly families, either hy arranging that they may remain in possessoon of their properties, or alternatively by ensuring that, if they are obliged (failing a sale on satisfactory terms) to surrender possession of their mini lands to the State , they shall receive proper compensation from the Government. 5. Lord Halifax therefore proposes to instruct Sir Maurice Peterson to inform the Iraqi Government that His Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the terms of the draft reply to Mr. Bateman’s note. He considers that the further communication to be addressed thereafter to the Iraqi Government should, subject to the further views of His Majesty's Ambassador, take the form of a formal note from the Ambassador to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (rather than a letter) and should indicate that if the non-Iraqi nationality of the heirs of the two Sheikhs should become the cause of impediment or delay in the grant to them of title deeds under the Land Settlement Law, His Majesty’s Government must reserve the right to seek redress from the Iraqi Government through the diplomatic channel. A redraft on these lines of the communication in question is enclosed herein. 6 . I am to enquire v/hether the Marquess of Zetland concurs in the action proposed.

Could you find out what is the position about the Sumraing Up in the case of the Zuhair heirs against the heirs of iiheiAh Mubarak of Kuwait ?. Judgement was given verbally on the Ibth for the Plaintiffs, and I heard from the Sheikh’s lawyer that it is usual for these to be a written summing up issued later, following which and within thirty days of the issue of which appeal can be made. According to the lawyer there has so far been no Summing Up, written or otherwise but in a case of this importance surely there must be a reasoned summing up° Could you get a side line on this from Goode privately?.

It is about the payraBnt of the translation which you so kindly permitted him to do, on payment, when a lengthy translation was urgently required for handing to Mr. Justice Lloyd, during the court case between the Zuhair family and the heirs of Gheikh Mubarak in tie Basra Court. The translation was one f r cm the jira bic statement of defence, prepared by an Egyptian lawyer, employed by His Mujesty ? s Government on behalf of tie heirs of Mubarak. 2 . in theory I think thrtrgr this bill of the translation should he paid by tie lawyer under the heading of his 'expenses”. In ftict as he did not seem disposed to do so the Sheikh himself through his son Mohammed, his -agent in Basra, was prepared to settle the bill. 3 .

He informs me that the uosition is somewhat as follows :- The plaintiff, having pleaded uoverty, was unable to denosit with the Courts the amount of the Court fees and until such time as the Court fees are paid no judgment will be served. The plaintiff has now requested, in view of the fact that judgment was given in his favour, that the fees should be collected, from the defendant, and has requested the Execution Department to act accordingly. Now, the position is that until the fees are paid nothing can be done. Your friends may, if they like, nay the plaintiff’s fees and then judgment will be serfed against your friends.

Shaikh Mubarak ll-Subah as per deed, also executed out of the Tapu Department, and Shaikh Mubarak,and his iieir-s after him, have taken full possession of the property and administered it upto 2931 then one of the daughters, kno^n as Bafi’ah Bint 4li Paslia, had institued a oas© Ho. 77/931 at the Court of Instance, Basra, ajjaimt H.H. Shaikh Ahmed M-Jatir Al-Suhah for restraining him from nreventing her to take possession (of her share?) of the said property. H.H. the Shaikh was defended hy the lawyer Sayid Muhammad vfasfl, the olaiia of the plaintiff was dismissed on the ground that a case should have Been instituted against the legality of the deed of sale Before instituing a o;ise for restraining the deferaient from preventing tiisJ talcixig of possession By the plaintiff. She appealed, against this decision, on 9.u.1931* &amp; • 1931 anal the Coiart of /ij eal held, that tiie &amp;o®&amp; on ^hioh the ag -X in Its decision Mo, 148/1931, oiiu of tht Shaikh relied needs no institution of a ome against its legality as, (due to its ■ being executed out of the Tapu separtnsnt) it is deemed non- exist ant. The papers of the suit were returned to the Court ( of Instance which re-examined, it on 30.12.1931 and issued a Judgement, then, for restraining the Shaikh from preventing the said Bafi*ah from taking possession of her shares in the said property* Service of the said Judgement was mails on the lawyer Sayid Muhammad ^asfi on 18*2.32 and it was passed, on to the Department of Executions and was served on the lawyer Iskander Mansur, who was appointed by iMul kziz vl-lalim on hehalf of the Shaikh with full authority, the lawyer Iskander Mansur filed, an appeal against this decision which was confirmed on 9th .May 1932 on the ground that sales effected out of the Tapu Department .are not recognised and that the second Judgement of the Court of Instance is correct, and thus the Judgament hecarie final* The Oourt of Instance,at Basra, wanted to serve ‘the judgement on r^, and on my refusal to accept service the legal procedure, In the face of a refusal, was made against me* Thai on 8,6*38 the lawyer Sayid Sulaiman Faidhi, on 'behalf of Kasim 'bin Abdul Bsq.ui ^. 1 —auhair, obtained an sttaohiaent against the share of the 2 nd daughter, Bahijah hint ill Pasha Al-luhair, for the date produce of this years date season of Al*Bashlyyah, the attachment was effected and a third person was appointed to tak© possession of the same* The shares of the other heir’s will certainly he attached soon because of the events of tnis case. treat the matter after uixs, aid according to the present Law of Iraq, there remains no legal course for us to follow in order to avoid the oases of these inheritors, and whoever, among them, wishes to institute a case against us ©an obtain a Judgment against us in the same way as was done by their sister Bafi # ah* I also oeleive that they can also demaid from us the value of the date produce for a time not exceeding 18 yeats on the ground that the sexier H&lt;1 . .or- } hajiyy^i Sh^fik^ii did not :rully represent the minors as there was another guardian over them, he is Ahmed Pasha Al-^uhair f g because the t^Lving of the dates produce can be deemed, as an action, by guardians, \4iich is against the interests of the minors, therefore, it cannot be upheld against them* 3* The course which we should take in this case is that we should ipiae&amp;iately contest the order of the Cheif Officer of Executions, by which the attachment was mid© against the share of Buhijah, and contend that we are the owners of the same and are in possession, and that the creditor of Bahljah has no right to attache the property in our hands, and that he has to refer the .matter to the Courts by instituting a suit. Although there is little or no hope cr lr of success, yet this is one the courses which are open to us, and which ®e must, primarily, follow while awaiting the result of the ease of Abdulla 1- 'uh-»i and this decision of the Court of Appeal on the folitioal points of the case. If the Court accepts our contentions on the Political points then we, on behalf of the heirs of Shaikh aubarak, can contest the case of Hafi’ah from that point, and then we oan hold on to this defence against all the other claimants. If the Court decides against us on the olitioal points then we would have no course left except to file a'suit against the heirs of Shafikah bint Hafidh for recovery of the value which she had received from the late Shaikh Kubarak tl-oubah, and the attaohment of her share and the shares of her heirs, the claimants in the present case, If we -re able to prove that they have received anything from the estate of heir mother, the K!&gt;ld shafikah* Usual ending./ Heirs of All Pasha Al-Zuahlr« ^ &gt; f \ i '-i i 1.

In his last Kote the plaintiff interpreted that statement as a recognition of Ms ownership, despite the lapse of time and gave as evidence of Ms allegation in this connexion Article 1674 of the n l:agallah ,: • -e should therefor© go back to the text of Article 1674 of the tt Lagallalr f in order to ascertain the intention of the author of that text. Article 1674 of the 'tlagailaM runs as follows?- si xhe forfeiture of right cannot be effected by lapse of time. There fore if the defendant clearly admits in the presence of the Courts that the plaintiff has an existing right in a case effected by prescription in the manner claimed by the plaintiff. no consideration should be given to the prescription and a decree should be issued in accordance with the confession of the defendant. st this is the text of the Article of n kl mag&amp;llalr which does not require any explanation. It also provides that the confession of the right claimed should take place during the progress of the case. 7he annotator of hue ^Mag&amp;ll&amp;h referred to that matter and gave examples in which he sayss- Th© word existing is a precautionary restriction which means that the confession of the defendant does not repel prescription except Aon he admits of that right being under his security. It therefore follows that if a person claims a property alleged to be in Ms ownership and inherited from his father ano the defendant replies that he purchased it from the father or uncle, for a certain ram, and has possessed it for 40 years, no evidence is required here in support of the purchase, but the only thing required from Mm is to prove his disposal of that property during that lapse of time, because in claiming the purchase from /the fatherthe father and mother of plaintiff, he did not admit of their ownership at present, and therefore his confess ion cannot he repelled by the prescription. If we revert after this to the definition of the is confession, a reference to this/made in article 1593 of the *: agallah' which runs as follows*- 'Confession is an achnowlodg^at by a person, of a right belonging to mother, therefor© he is called the confessor while the other is called the person confessed to, and the right, the aclmowledged right. After explaining these rules, we have to return to what the plaintiff called the acknowledged right. It appears that the plaintiff has not understood the real fact ot attempted to establish the contrary, All that wc said is that we purenasod that property and produced documents in support thereof * ,niis re’.juts the clai., put forward by the plaintiff for the ownership of that property. therefore the prescription neither repels nor forfeits the statement made by us in thio connexion. There now remains the question oi the legal excuse. The plaintiff appears to have differed from us In the interpretation of the internittcat absence and gave as evidence of his allege- tlon the text of Articles 1463 and 14ti4. he comait-ued a nistake in this and perhaps he wished to refer to Articles 1663 and 1664. before discussing the provisions of those two Articles, we consider it advisable to speak briefly on the question of the excuses that repel the lapse of time. e have now an epistle by fcoitre ^ Kheir A1 ^u -feegi Bey, President of the Parquet in the Civil Circle of the Court of Cassation, caned Suspension of prescription for compulsory reasons one. —- M !t o»t»i».d a. optol»« ot «-» “ “ u ' tho..

The author mentions on pa^e 11 of that epistle the following* - Baudrat (?) and lessie (?) are of the opinion that the prescription was enacted for social interest iris* the stability of the fait aocoxapli and paying no heed to past events, overlooking the wisdom in enacting the law of prescription which is tn elmm. ' „ : the prescription is based on the presumption that the owner of the right has neglected his right and left it, and did not pay any attention for its aaintenmce and therefore the incapable person is to he exerted from the application of the prescription on account of his lack of dieerlnin&amp;iion- Hi© same should be logically applied to whoever cannot maintain his right owing to forced circumstances, because in that case he absolutely cannot claim his right* It is impossible to ascribe to negligence or inability a case where action was impossible. A person cannot be asked to do the Impossible* In reply to Baudret and Bessie 1 s allegation that the interest of the Individual should be forfeited for public interest the author points out that laws were intended for the complete sacrifice of the interest of the individual to the public benefit, but that the interest of the individual should also be taken Into consideration* The author of the epistle then left to rc*as*ons lor the prescription for discussion of legal excuses, and dealt with the question of abconco, pointing out on page 13 the following;- m he question of absence has remained the source oi difference of opinion in the fgyptian. Courts, owing to the text of Article 132 of a book called Auurshed al hayra&amp;n ( A guid© for the perplexed) which places absence with minority and lunacy, and considers it among legal excuses which prevents the progress of lapse of time. /The author** 9 • * t&amp;e mtfoor iMm Ms person-'’X opinion with rosard to the question of absence and stated on page 14 the folloMrigs- w Pistinction eliould be mad© in the ease of absenoe between two things# If the absence is a co-men m®» (i*e# if m a person Imrm for a certain knom or^nknoiria place and tlien returns) Ms absence in this ease cannot prevent the progress of prescription, because it wms possible for him to bake the necessary m&amp;mxrm before Ms depariure for the protection of Ms rights txm forfeiture# if he lives £m amy Ms country, it is posrible for hte * in the existence of the present facilities agreed upon mma the various QomxnmmbB - to send a power of attomoy to whoever represents Mxa in clais**' ing Ms rights, failing this ho will be considered, ncgliaent* Proscription ciemot be ©uspondod in the pro snap tioa of negligenc© as already snentioned# An oseepticmal ease snouM be allowed if the absentee suffered from a forced, incident during Ms absence, stioli as captivity, the cutting of or the quarantine reBtrictaons o-a ot posih o -..-c # la / eanaot bo oooo^.la c for m- -sois v hrnMmt filioh m&amp; not the result these cases the of absence but for the of any nagllgonee* -;yat if a person was caused to be absent by fores# for exarspl® toeing deported from hia am aoantry, reel: shall not he excused if it *** i» hle bfeforc hls departure to ap &gt;oiat an Agent or wa«, during hie doportuition, able be aP!«Jint m reprcscnfeafciw to fUe 0 cult clateln8 * ila rl#t. ihc contrary 1c applied, if ^ ^ that he wa. deported to a place tfeere he could not appoint m . 3 ent, „ ,, ft fitftfce of abrolutc inability to do anything or was iu s.

Xn both eases the prceeription ehoulfl be applied against him, because the agent represents him in the maintenance of his rights against forfeit. In the ease of negligence on the part of the '.gent, he himself or his heirs have grounds of action against the Agent. It may be pointed out in objection to this that the proscription is not applied to the incapacitated for vto©3» a guardian or attendant is appointed to administer his affairs and maintain his ri^ite. In reply to this 1 have to say that the incapacitated lames dleerledhsatieo and cannot administer his am affairs, if he finds his guardian or attendant negligent in maintaining his rights* therefore the legislator has provided a special procedure for this. She absmtee of gfo diaerijaination ow administer and maintain hi® ow» rights. If he appoints an Agent, or snob ®m igent is appointed by the JhdS® a - his behalf, he has to widorgo the cxmseuuenoes of his bad selection in the first place, and the non-administration of his own affairs which is a kind of negligence and does warrant fixe suspension of the prescription. Also if the judge appoints an Agent to an absentee whose absence Is intermittent* and that if his absence was of hie own accord, leaving hie affairs without being administered and his rights maintained, this is also considered a negligence which docs not warrant the suspension of the proscription. in this caw tee forced «vents &amp;j*0 lo ousaaarlse taxes® opinions the suspension of the proscription goo® *«»**•* *•*»*• ,risl *'******• iari ' mojeur and absence.

It a pears tmm that text that when referring to the incapacitated, it was decided not to apply the prescription whether such person was legally represented or not* fhc sutnor later referred to the aBsentee and did not mention anything regarding his legal representative, fhle distinction on his part means that the case with regird to aBsenc© differs from that of incapacity, That is to sey he mahes no difforesee in the case of incapacity itaelf* whether there is representative or otherwise. In the case of aisense* the presence of an igeirfc prevents the suspension of prescription whether such igest was appointed By the aBsontee or the judge.
