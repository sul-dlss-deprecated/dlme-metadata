                           A collection of Treaties,Engagements,and sunnuds relating to India and neighbouring countries,(India 1862-65)Henry Wheaton,
                           Wheaton's Elements of International Law(Boston:Sampson Low, 1864)The notes take the form of answers to questions on the publications, although the questions are only included for the notes on Wheaton's elements.The answers to questions on Aitchison's treaties are dated 19 May 1873 and all appear to relate to the states in India. The answers to Wheaton's work are dated 31 May 1873 and relate primarily to definitions on natural law and international law.At the end of both the answer sections there is an illegible signature with the initials CB and his position which may be 'Assistant Agent Governor General'.The title for this file originally attributed the notes to Lewis Pelly however not only do the signatures not match Pelly's but none of the papers in the file are written in his handwriting.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Charles Umpherston Aitchison</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Wheaton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x0003a5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
