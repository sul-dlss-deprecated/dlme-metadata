Ko. SiT'''- Adviserate, January 17, 1948 For a long time we have been trying to obtain a printing press which will be used for printing Government forms and also for printing a Government Gazette or a local newspaper. I feel that the need for this is now really urgent. We have at present no effective means of counteracting the increasing amount of mischievous political propaganda which is being directed against not only the Bahrain Govern ment but the British Government, If we had some sort of official news sheet we could publish statements and statistics which the public should know. 2. We have on order a secondhand printing press - we tried to obtain a new one but the shortest time for delivery was five years. We are buying it through Charles Kendall who is also trying to obtain Arabic type. It appears to be very difficult to obtain such type and I have today received a telegram from Kendall saying though many enquiries are in progress early delivery cannot be promised. The press is due to arrive here in about two months. 3. In view of our urgent need for Arabic type would it be possible for you^f to use your influence with the authorities in England to expedite the supply of Arabic type. C.J'.
