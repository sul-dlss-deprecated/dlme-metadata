                  <summary>Letter, mostly written by Solomon ‘the lowly’ (i.e. the Gaʾon Solomon b.
                     Judah), to Abraham ha-Kohen ‘Prince of the Congregation’ b. Isaac ha-Kohen,
                     asking the recipient to use his influence with the governor Abū l-Futūḥ
                     ha-Nagid, in order that Qayyīn b. ʿAbd al-Qādir, can avoid prosecution for
                     offences committed in the past but of which he has since repented, probably
                     relating to his former political loyalties. This request is being sent on
                     behalf of Murajjā ‘Elder of the Princes of the city’ (perhaps Ramla), who is a
                     friend of the accused. Both the accused and his friend are Muslim,
                     demonstrating the extent of Abraham’s influence as a physician to the Islamic court. </summary>

            <p>To the dear, glorious, honourable, great, holy master and teacher Abraham ha-Kohen
               ‘Prince of the Congregation’ – may the Rock be his aid and his shelter’s shade, and
               may he crown him and help him find grace, and hope and trust in Him – son of the
               honourable, holy master and teacher Isaac ha-Kohen – his rest be in Eden. Accept, our
               mighty Prince of the Congregation, a blessing from the LORD and righteousness from
               the God of his salvation, as well as from me and from my son, much wellbeing without
               end. The intention of these lines to his Honour concerns a request that was asked of
               me by an elder from the city's nobles by the name Murajjā, one of my greatest friends
               who honours me exceedingly. Men of his acquaintance came to him and asked him to make
               a request of his Honour. The one known as Qayn b. ʿAbd al-Qādir had reported that the
               governor, whose name and byname is Abū l-Futūḥ, Ruler of the District, has been
               seeking [his arrest] due to his earlier deeds. [Qayn] came to ask for a letter to his
               Honour asking this Abū l-Futūḥ the Ruler to do him no harm because he had already
               repented. And this man Qayn came and threw himself down on the floor: ‘I am your
               supplicant!’ And so I am requesting of his Honour to speak to the Ruler so that he
               does not harm him. And inform him of my standing with [his Honour] and of my standing
               with the elder so that my request will be more acceptable to him. And whatever he
               does to this man Qayn he also does to me, because members of his household came to
               the place where I am living now: they know that I am in good standing with our elder
               Prince of the Congregation. And may his wellbeing and the wellbeing of his honour and
               of his retinue and of his friends grow and not be laid low. A great salvation!</p>
            <p>Solomon the downtrodden, who looks for and awaits God’s salvation.</p>
