I informed His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran or this, and suggested that, in order to avoid an unfruitful contro versy and as in Bushire 1 am Consul-General mot Resident, I proposed subject to his approval informing my correspondents to address envelopes in future 'His Britannic Majesty*s Consul- General'.

To The, Political Agents, Muscat, Bahrain and. Kuwait Cl tt c U L A ft / / Vv r ith reference to my Circular No/189-S of 19th February 1934 with regard to Intelligence Summaries. 2. political Agents are reminded that the main object of the fRew form of Intelligence Summaries (taking the place of the old Diaries) which are now marked 'Secret', is to keep the numerous officials outside the Persian uulf. who are interested in its affairs, informed of the trend of events along the Arab Coast. If this object is achieved the writing of ad interim letters to these officials should be much reduced. 3. The following are examples of what is meant (a) The Patagonian Peacock Company are endeavouring to obtain a concession for the export of peacock feathers irom the territory of Shaikh Saif bin Faloos, who is also being approached by the British peacock Company. The Intelligence Summary of the r 0 litical Agent, in whose area these activi ties are being carried out, would contain these facts under an appropriate heading. In his next Summary the political Afent would chronicle the fact that the negotiators of both Companies had arrived and had commenced negotiations. Later he might have to give the information that Bin Faloos was inclined toward the foreign concern. Later still, he might have to mention that matters between the Shaikh and the two Companies had come to a deadlock. Finally, I trust, the political Agent would be in the happy position of stating /-stating that the British Company had secured the concession. (b) The Koyal Air -force wish to establish a base somewhere in a Political Agent T s territory. There are the usual delays but finally the ftoyal Air -force get what they want. The Political Agent concerned would note these various steps in his •Summaries. (c) Therfc is a state of unrest in some part of a Political Ageit T s area. He would note this in his Summary and continue to touch on the situation until it had been cleared up- 4. Mentions in Summaries can be brief as they are supple mented by the usual telegrams and desp|aches to the political Resident, Details of negotiations with ShaiKhs should not be given, nor normally should opinions be volunteered (these of course can be given in separate communications to the Political Resident). What are wanted are f acts . Sd/- T. C # Towle. Political Resident in the PersianNo. 1119-S of 1954. British Residency &amp; Consulate-Lr e neral Bushire, the ^9th November 1954. To The political Agents, Muscat, Bahrain ana Kuwait. circular Not infrequently it happens that political Agents have to co-operate with Naval ana Royal Air Force authorities in their political areas. When the particular incident etc. is at an end the political Agent concerned v/rites a report addressed to uhe Political Resident summing it up and giving his views in general. The practice has grown up for political Agents to send copies of these reports direct to the Senior Naval Utlicer, rersian uulf, and the Air Otiicer Commanding, Baghdad. 2 . There is no particular harm in this practice, but it contrary to the normal procedure of all Services whether Civil or Military by which an officer only communicates with the officer under whom he is serving, who deal with his Reports as is thought fit. 5. Moreover the Naval and Roya; Air Force authorities connected with the uulf quite correctly follow the normal procedure: the Resident does not receive copies of reports direct from officers serving under the Senior Naval Officer and the Air officer Commanding. 4. In all the circumstances therefore, and having regard to the lact that the Senior Naval Officer and Air Officer Commanding receive direct irom political Agents copies of their Intelligence Summaries which should keep them generally in conn .^ection with incidents, reconnaissances and so lorth informed /-•if © - 2 - inrormed or the course or events in the uuli, I should like the practice mentioned in paragraph 1 to cease. 5. It is hardly necessary to say that this ruling should in no way be taken as lessening the close co-opera tion, which I am glad to say, exists between political Officers and Naval and Royal Air Force Oiiicers, or the exchange of Intelligence. Set/- T. C. Fowle political Resiaent in the Persian oulf(Original at pa ^e 25 of file 3/1) ' Confidential. D.O.Bo.C/234 of 1936 Office of the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain, 25th November 1936 My dear Loch, You will remember that we discussed the increased powers which have been given to the Indian Assistant by his being made a Magistrate of the First Class. The main reason for our applying to Government for his being put in the First Class was not to get him these increased powers but to eneble him to try cases summarily, which he could only do if he was made a First Class Magistrate. 2. As you know, 1 am anxious that these increased powers should be exercised with due discretion and should be adequately controlled by you. If you think, therefore, that certain of the more serious cases which the Indian Assistant can now try as a Magistrate of the First Class should come before you please arrange accordingly. This could, 1 think, be done b; r an order by you, in your capacity of District Magistrate, limiting the powers of the Indian Assistant. This procedure might, however, have an unfortunate effect on the position of the Indian Assistant, and the better way would be to inform him that certain classes of cases should in the first instance come before you. You can always, if you think fi£, transfer these cases to the Indian Assistant for trial. 3 /- Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch, C.i.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.7 2 3. With regard to the summary powers of the Indian Assistant I enclose two copies of a note which you may find of use. ' One copy of the note might be given to the Indian Assistant for his guidance. You will see, vide last para graph of the note, that even in cases tried summarily there is now an appeal except when a sentence of a fine only not exceeding Rs. 200 has been passed. 4. While on the subject of judicial procedure in Bahrain, you are av/are of course that under section 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure all trials by a Sessions The Sessions Judge in Bahrain, i.e. the Political Agent, is however also the District Magistrate, and the special powers mentioned in s ection 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were, I understand, accorded to him in Prior's time (you might check this and let me have the reference). This being so, jury or assessors can be dispensed with by the Political Agent trying, as District Magistrate, and not as Sessions Judge, all offences not punishable with death. If, however, it is desired to give a punishment of transport- seven years, the Political Agent, will have to try the offence in his capacity of Sessions Judge. 5. As this letter deals with certain general principles tice of successive Assistant Political Agents, Bahrain, and also to new Political Agents, on taking over.

A further limitation under sec. 260 is that no case in which a Magistrate exercises the special powers conferred by sec. 34 can be tried summarily (This does not affect the Indian Assistant, who does not enjoy these special powers, but it does the Political Agent, who, in his capacity of District Magistrate, is so empowered). B. PUNISHMENT 651 p. 652 Note 8 Sec. 262 (1). No sentence of Imprisonment for a term exceeding three months can be passed in a summary trial.

Circular Memorandum As you are aware in most Administrations it is quite unusual Tor political Agents to receive papers direct from outside authorities or to address these authorities direct or repeat to them cogiies of communications adaressed to the Head of the Administration, owing however to the somewhat peculiar circumstances which exist in the Persian uuif i.e. delays in communication between my headquarters and the Agencies, some years ago I agreed to political Agents being sent direct by outside authorities, e.g. the inaia office and the uovern- ment of India, copies of papers addressed to me. 2. In doing so, however, I made it clear that {a) no decision should be taken by the political Agent, or (b) no approach be made to the local Ruler by him without prior reference to me; and (c) that no opinion should be expressed by the political Agent to outside authorities on papers received by him, also without prior reference to me. These instructions are obviously essential since the final responsibility for all political matters in the Persian (iulf rests on the Political Resident. 5. The system generally has worked well for several years, despite the disadvantage that every now and then a political Agent inadvertently overlooks my instructions. The only alternative would be for Political Agents not to receive any papers /-- 2 - |w papers direct, which would result in much delay and additional labour. 4. With regard to 2(c) above. What I had in mind was that in order to save time Political Agents could repeat to the India Ol'fice or other outside authority the result of action taken, without giving an expression of their opinion, which would be cnveyed separately to the Political Resident only. In view, however, of the difficulty of separating facts and opinion in such cases, I am of opinion it is best that Politi cal Agents should not, unless specifically instructed by me, repeat to outside authorities their reports to the political Resident. 1 5. The restrictions referred to in paragraph 2 aoove natural -ly apply with equal if not greater force to suggestions or expressions of opinion initiated by Political Agents, which should in no case be addressed or repeated to outside authori ties since the Political Resident may or may not agree with the views expressed by the Political Agent. ■ L he correct procedure in such cases is for the Political Agent to address the Poli tical Resident only. 6. I trust that Political Agents wall adhere strictly to the instructions contained in this Circular. Sd/- T.C. Fowle.

Dear Prior, There has recently come to notice a tendency on the part of certain officers of the Political Service to address to officers of the Headquarters Secretariat Staff, or to Heads of Local Administrations, communica tions marked ^Private and Personal ft in which they give expression to views, preferences, and even complaints, about postings orders by vhich they are, or are likely to be, affected. 9 )# This practice is open to objection on more than one ground, first and foremost it is obviously essen tial that at a time like the present when war conditions are putting an unprecedented strain on the man power ox the Department, to an extent which is perhaps not generally realised, the high standard of public service and sense of duty expected of Political Officers should be maintained more scrupulously than ever before. 3. Secondly, though those responsible for making the postirg are well aware that a similar strain is being imposed upon individual officers by increasing work, private anxieties and shortage cf leave, it must be clearly recognised that the predominant objective can only be the employment of every officer in such a manner as to secure the greatest public benefit. In such circumstances private inconveniences may often have to be ruthlessly disregarded, and it is only when the circumstances that an officer wishes to bring to notice are such as to be relevant to his efficiency in the appointment to which it is proposed to post him that they can be seriously considered.4. Thirdly, it is clearly undesirable that informa tion of this nature should reach the Secretariat in the form of 'Private and Personal' letters. Hot only is such correspondence likely to give rise to the impres sion that private friendships can be exploited for official ends hut, strictly speaking, information privately given ought not to he disclosed or taken into consideration by those isha have to determine questions of posting, even though it may be clear that it ms the intention or the hope of the waiters of such letters that this would be done. 5. For these reasons it has been found necessary to issue this order that no letters or representations of the nature referred to above shall be addressed to Headquarters by officers belcw the rank of Second Glass Resident otherwise than through the Head of the Local Administration under which they are serving. Heads of Administrations are requested to discourage such refer ences as far as possible and are accorded the discretion to withhold them, the criterion being to forward only such information or requests which they judge as being desirable to be brought to official notice, or to the personal notice of the Political Adviser ar Foreign Secretary, in the interests of the public service. Further any such representations will be regarded as demi-official and will be taken on record and, if necessary, taken into account on the confidential file of the officer concerned, 6. I am to request that you will kindly inform all officers of the Indian Political Service serving under you in the above terms. In so doing you will perhaps make it clear that the tendencies to which exception is being taken have been observed hitherto only among a small proportion of the officers of the cadre.

Rrom To The Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushirg. The Political Agent, la h r ^ln . Sir, / I have the honour to refer to the Honourable the Political Resident’s demi-official letter No. 16/42/8 dated the 5th January, 1940, to Mr. Weightman (copy enclosed for ready reference) and to say that it appears that no action has been taken upon the orders conveyed therein. In at least one case recently which should obviously have been conducted by the Assistant Political Agent, the onus was placed on the Indian Assistant with most unfortunate results. I am desired to say that it is considered essential that the Assistant Political Agent should handle a certain number of cases under the Indian Codes each month, and Sir Geoffrey would be glad if you would arrange that appropriate ones are transferred from your file or that of the Indian Assistant to his. It would not dislocate work unduly in the Agency if the Assistant Political Agent heard such cases on at least four days per mensem and I would request that this may be done in future and the records of the cases produced for the Political Resident’s inspection at his next visit. 2. Since it appears that these instructions have been lost sight of in the past I am to request that a copy of this letter should be placed upon your handing over file. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, jtoKw- ^ ~(Ua cV NS. Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,T Copy of demi-official letter No.16/42/8, dated the 5th January, 1944, from the Eon’tJle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to K. Weightman, Esguire, Political Agent, Bahrain. I was very disturbed to find on my last ' visit to Bahrain that Hallows is doing no judicial work whatever. It is essential that he should take a number of civil cases, so that he will not forget his Civil Law altogether. Now that a Naval Reporting Officer has been posted to Bahrain, I imagine that the work must have been lightened in the Agency office, and I would be glad if you would arrange for Hallows to take some selected civil suits, and also a few interesting criminal cases, so that I can see specimens of his judicial work at my next visit. 2. I am disappointed in the progress he has made in his Arabic, and presume it is due to lack of leisure since good teachers are available in Bahrain. If, he has some cases given him In which Arabs are involved, he will be killing two birds with one stone and improve his Arabic while brushing up his knowledge of the Law.
