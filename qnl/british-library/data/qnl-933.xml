Kemball states that the real objective of Sheikh Ali's mission in Bushire was to seek help from the Resident in the removal of the former Bahrain sheikh's sons from Damaum [Dammam]. Kemball writes that the Bahrain sheikhs propose to pay their relatives at Dammam an annual sum of 6,000 dollars, provided they retire to Kuwait or the Persian coast. Kemball also states that he intends to despatch the Bahrain Agent Hajee Jassim to Dammam to begin negotiations with the former Bahrain sheikh's sons at Dammam, with a view to establishing a truce between the two factions of the Khalifa family. There are a number of enclosures appended to the letter:1) Translated extract of a letter (ff 61-62) from Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Kemball, dated 23 September 1852. Sheikh Ali asks that Kemball request the Muscat Resident [Agent] to make enquiries at that place as to whether 'hostile designs' on Bahrain are being 'entertained' by the Imam of Muscat;2) Translation of a document (ff 62-63) given [and written] by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa Kemball, dated 24 September 1852, stating the proposal made by the Sheikh of Bahrain to pay the sons of Abdullah ben Ahmed 6,000 dollars annual tribute if they would remove themselves from Demaum [Dammam] to Kuwait or the Persian Coast;3) Translation of a letter (f 63 1) from Kemball to Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, dated 24 September 1852, acknowledging receipt of Sheikh Ali's proposal (ff 62-63), and reiterating that to his knowledge the Imam has no intentions to invade Bahrain, evidenced by his impending departure to his dominions at Zanzibar.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x00000e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
