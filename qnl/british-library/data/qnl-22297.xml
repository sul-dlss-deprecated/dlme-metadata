V- of 1366 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated 6th Dhulqada, 1366 September 20, 1947. H. B. M 1 s Political Agent Bahrain. Memorandum : I wish to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Sulman has ordered an increase of the existing dearness allowances in the salaries of all Bahrain Government employees from 25$, 15$ and 7£$ to 50$ to those drawing salaries under Es.300/-, 30$ on all salaries under Rs. 1,000/- and 15$ on all salaries above ik.1,000/- respectively. He has also ordered a 20$ increase on the present rate of 30$ on the Civil List salaries and a raise in the wages of labour employed by the P.W.D. and other Government departments. The total cost to the Government of this raise without the labour wages will be around Re.5,50,000/- per year. This does not include the Electricity Department and the Food Control Depart ment because these departments pay their own revenu so the amount involved by the raise in dearness allowances will be met from the revenue of two departments. The order has been put into effect and the increase will be paid from first of the Current Arabic month. I should appreciate your formal approval. ^ Ag. Adviser to the Government \ CosKcRatiai.

The increases in the allowances of those on the Civil List require your approval, and I feel that they should not have been brought into effect in anticipation of it. 3. The increase in the wages^of labour employed by the Bahrain Government (I understand it is ~/12/~ a day for working days only) and the increase in Dearness Allowance from 25# to 50# for persons drawing less than Rs.300/-p.m. are, in my view, justified. An increase in the wages paid to labourers was inevitable* and the Bahrain Government were having difficulty in recruiting and retaining any but the least employable clerks on their previous scales of pay. 4. The increases in the higher paid posts and in the allowances of those on the Civil List are also justified by the general increase in the wages of ser vants and in the cost of living generally that will result from the Arabian American Oil Company’s action in increasing wages. 5. The additional purchasing power released by the Bahrain Government (and other employers will have to follow them) will increase the demand for goods already in short supply; and, with the increase in che cost of food, will aggravate the present inflation in Bahrain. It constitutes, therefore, an argument against undue relaxation of internal price controls; but the release of new purchasing power itself has been dictated by the action of the Arabian American Oil Company over which the Bahrain Government have no control. 6. I should be grateful if I could be informed whether you approve of the increases in salaries and allowances already conceded by the Bahrain Government. v D.O. Wo. C/989 POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 1st of October, 1947 Dear Colonel Galloway 2 I enclose a copy of a letter from Yours sincerely The Hon’ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., 0•B•E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf B a h r a 1 n. NS.POLITICAL AGSNCY BAHRAIN, The 2nd of October, 1947 D.O. No.C/990, Dear Colonel Galloway, please refer to the correspondence resting with my demi-official letter No.c/989 dated the 1st October, 1947, and particularly to paragraph 2 of your demi- official letter No.1662-8 dated the 13th September, 1947, S' ^ 2. Regarding the condition of labourers and artizans in Bahrain I was of the opinion - vide paragraph 4 of rny demi-official letter No.C/958, dated the 11th September, 1947 - that the Bahrain Government should endeavour to retain their artizans in their employment by paying reasonable wages and by endeavouring to provide - by good administration - attractive living conditions in Bahrain rather than by restricting emigration in search of more profitable employment. 3. You will have seen from my demi-official letter No.C/989 dated the 1st October, 1947, that the Bahrain Government have now decided to increase the wages of all their employees and that Smith estimates that this will cost the Bahrain Government an additional S-J lakhs a year excluding additional disbursements by the Electricity and Food Control Departments. 4. At the same time I have received from the Acting Adviser a proposal to abolish price and export controls on all commodities other than those for which quotas are allotted from India, or for which foreign exchange is granted by the Agency. A copy of his letter is enclosed. / 'V 5. The increase in wages to be made by the Bahrain Government - which will also have to be made by the ; : .f-. Residency, the Agency, and other employers in Bahrain - will add considerably to the present excessive purchasing power which is already chasing inadequate supplies of consumer goods; and, in spite of controls, will contri bute directly and indirectly (through blaekmarket opera tions) to the inflationary spiral in Bahrain. 6. While, therefore, I am in general sympathy with the desire of the merchant community for freedom from controls, I cannot ignore the increase in the cost of living of labourers, artizans, and clerks which would occur if there were a sharp rise in the prices of essential and semi-essential commodities in Bahrain. To permit such a rise by the removal of price and export controls would discount the increases in wages now being made, and would considerably diminish the present favour able ratio between wages and the cost of living, upon /which The Hon'ble Lb-Col. political A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.J i - 2 - which the Bahrain Government and the companies here largely depend - or should depend - to retain their labour forces. ?. The merchants* argument that the removal of controls would induce them to import goods more freely and in larger quantities, and would reduce prices through the effects of competition, is one that can be supported by some examples, but many instances could be adduced to show that removal of controls has else where resulted in sharp rises in prices; because, however strong the merchants' desire freely to import large quantities of goods, many of the goods required here are just not available for export in sufficient quantities. For instance: there are a number of firms importing British textiles into Bahrain and none can get more than occasional token shipments of goods. 8. ^ I have therefore carefully gone through the details of the Bahrain Government's proposal and have amended the current Order relaxing price controls on a large range of goods while retaining export controls and price controls on commodities which are essential to those in the lower income groups, and which are still in short supply. These changes meet most of the merchants' objections; and I have not gone further because I consider that the need to maintain stable prices for essential consumer^goods (as a means of retaining the labour employed by the Oil Company on which the State depends) outweighs the desirability of meeting in full the merchants' demand for freer trading. 9. I enclose for your information a copy of Order No.8 of 1947 which supersedes Order No. 7 of 1947 sent to the Residency with Agency printed Letter No.2314 dated the 12th of July, 1947.
