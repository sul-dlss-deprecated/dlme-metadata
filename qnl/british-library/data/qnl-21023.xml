Sir, I have the honour to inform you with reference to your Despatch No.119 (E 1649/1130/34) of March 1st last that Doctor Alex Mann, lately agent in England of Ban Saud, has arrived in Tehran. He states that he has come to Persia as Representative of the phoenii; Oil and Transport Company, iiis principals, amongst ^ihom he mentions Sir Norton Griffiths, desire to acquire the oil rights around Damg^an and iiamman, situated on the Tehran-^shed road. He states that in Europe he met certain sons of the late Sani-ed-Dowleh who informed him that tney held a Firman according tnem the rights in question, but he had not seen the document. Damghan and Samnan are generally reckoned as being outside any of the Horthern Provinces which are covered by the Sinclair or Haji koin Bushiri Oil Concessions, but in that case it would appear that tney come within the concession of tne Anglo-Persian Oil Company whose concession, 1 believe, comprises the whole of Persia with the exception of the five Northern provinces, it will be of interest to learn wnether sush a Firman as mentioaed by Doctor kann exists and if sa what is the date of the document. In ar^ case Doctor kan states that he is unable to pursue the question for the moment as there is no commercial The Right Honourable J.Ramsay wacDonald, M.P. Foreign Office.f commercial outlet for any oil unich may be found but he hopes that it may be possible to have a clause for right of transport inserted into the Sinclair or into Haji Moi^s Grilan Concession which would enable him to pursue the matter further. I have, etc., (Sgd.)
