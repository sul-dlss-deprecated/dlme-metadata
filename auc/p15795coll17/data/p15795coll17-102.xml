Cleland interview</dc:title><dc:creator>Cleland, Wendell W.</dc:creator><dc:description>Wendell Cleland was one of the founders of The American University in Cairo from 1917, served as Director of AUC’s Extension Division from 1920 to 1947, played other administrative roles and became a Trustee, and was interim President from 1953-1954. Grace Cleland, his wife, supported the life of the university. Wendell Cleland, while assistant to  Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the United Presbyterian Church Charles R. Watson, was asked to support Watson’s exploratory study of bringing an American university to Egypt. Cleland explains the university’s intended mission and tells of being sent later faculty member Carl McQuiston to visit Egypt to study the situation in 1917, travelling via the Far East and India due to the First World War in Europe. Because of the war it was decided to postpone the project and that Cleland would pursue relief work in Palestine and Syria; he describes his efforts and contacts among the Arab village population, Jewish Zionists, the British military, and American residents of Jerusalem.  Wendell Cleland recalls returning with Grace Cleland to Cairo in 1919 to start the university, and purchasing the palace that became AUC’s Main Building, hiring the first Egyptian faculty members, and developing an academic program; students enrolled for the opening of classes in Fall 1920. He describes AUC students (among them Palestinians and Jews), prominent alumni, and the admission of female students. Besides the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Cleland also outlines the emergence of the School of Oriental Studies and its Arabic language programs, and recounts the story of the donation of funds for the construction of the S.O.S. Building and Ewart Hall auditorium.  He relates the development of AUC’s Extension Division and its mission and activities like adult education courses, village welfare projects, and Arabic lectures by prominent Egyptian speakers at Ewart Hall.  Grace Cleland also offers her recollections of early efforts to open AUC, learn Arabic, find housing, and provide meals for short-term faculty. She also tells of operating a neighborhood health clinic and establishing in 1923 what became the Cairo Women’s Club, with an international and multi-religious membership; she reflects on how the progress of the club echoed changes in women’s place in Egypt. </dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
