Reference your Memorandum Ho .TB/S dated 25th July 1942 about recruitment of labour units* 2. It is difficult to estimate the prospects of success for a recruiting campaign such as is suggested, but the effort is well worth making. 3. In Bahrain itself it is not impossible that, if recruit ing is done in the right way (i*e. through officials of the Bah rain Government) and if the standard of physique expected is not very high, 300 to 400 recruits might be forthcoming. In Bahrain it is unlikely that suitable material for officers could be found. Men of the right type, who are few in number, have already secured employment with the Bahrain Government. 4. On the Trucial Coast conditions are different. Arabs there would not enlist in a labour unit for service away from their own homes. A few Persians might enlist, but even this is doubtful as they can earn 12 annas a day locally as coolies and do not like leaving their families. It might be possible, how ever, to find a few young men of the officer class - Arabs of good social status and with good abilities. To attract such men the pay offered would have to be good, probably not less than Rs 25u/- p.m., as commercial enterprise at Dubai at present offers big rewards and is absorbing quite a number of men who might otherwise make good officers.

The position regarding Kuwait was given in para 3 °f your telegram Jo. 83 O dated the 14th May 1942. While wishing to do everything possible to assist the Array authorities in finding the required personnel it must be pointed out that the demand for labour in Kuvait is increasing and so far as can be foreseen is likely to go on increasing. If this increase continues saturation point may soon be reached. Barge construction for the X/T at tlie hoped for *nte of 90 per month, the extraction, loading and unloading of the Bitumen ordered by the 10th Array, (with the possibility of the United States Military Mission also requiring large quantities of Bitumen) the big sand contract with the AIOG, the likelihood of large quantities of stone being required by the Military AKfchaixxJu: Authorities for building purposes in Basra, the increasing dcm&amp;nu rsvra for XMk local local craft which will still'fui'th r increase when soiling season begins all place heavy deiaimds on the limited labour available. The removal cf kb our in any numbers night easily interfere with these operations ■ftiiich ;ur*e all iiaportant adjuncts to the war effort. Only if economic conditions compelled them would Kuwaiti labourers be likely to be prepared to work away from their homes ano with the present and increasing op^ j ortunities for work here, the high rates of ^ay oi»d adqu&amp;td food supplies it seems most unlikely even if labour conditions permitted, that recruits would be forthcoming. The basic pay of Rs. 30/- per month with rations end clothing would not compare unduly favourably wit]i local average rates of Rs i/S/Lper day for coolies and Rs 2/- per day for head coolies. Good class Arabs are usually adverse to being conneotec v.ith such work but a small number might be found if the terns of service were sufficiently attractive. (3gd) R.I.

(ill) Very few men will volunteer to go beyond the Basra- Jhaibah area. A definite guarantee that they will not be sent further north or east is essential. (iv) Men should not be asked to bind themselves for more than one year. They wish to feel that they can return to their chief industry of pearl fishing when it recommences in flay 1944 if they wish. Many will probably stay and others will replace those who go. (v) N.C.Os should be local men. These can be found. N*C.0s should be subject to dismissal but not reduction. V.C.Os should be uslima. Provided the above conditions are agreed to a battalion of about 1000 men can be raised, approximately half from Bahrain and 25 % from Sharjah and Muacat respectively. If it is decided to proceed with enlistment the following steps should be takea. The revised terms should be intimated at once to the^ Political Officers for general information. One senior recruit- ii**- officer and two assistants together with a medical officer should proceed.as soon as possible to Bahrain. Local authori ties can arrange for their accommodation at Bahrain, Sharjah and Muscat respectively. .As many as possible of these officers should speak Arabic. It is essential to commence at as early a date as possible since local personnel engage themselves as pearl divers some weeks before the pearling season opens (May to September). Suggested provisional instructions for the Chief Hecruiting Officer designate are attached.lost details can be settled on arrival by personal discussion with Mr* * akefleld and certain other officials with local knowledge. The following points should be borne in mind t- 1. Pay should be drawn from the date of enlistment but free rations should not be^given except in riahrain where 2m Physique will improve rapidly on receipt of army rations 3* Arrangements must be made for family allotments and payments to pearl diving employers* 4* Strict non-combatant status must be stressed. Unlike the Indian the local men do not like being regarded as semi- combatant. 5* Kssentlal cooks and sanitary men should be enlisted as specialists in these duties. Interpreters can he enlisted locally; if necessary these can be augmented on arrival at Basra*Urgent No. OS of 1362 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Moharram 18, 1362 January 25, 1943. H. B. M f s Political Agent, Baura in. J. C. ■ 3-y Memorandum: - With reference to the possibility of recruiting labour in Bahrain, I should like to acquaint you with the following facts which perhaps you could forward to the authorities. I have been recruiting men for the State Police as we are at present under strength. While doing so I enquired from the men who have attended the Fort for enlistment in the Police whether if they were offered coolie work in Basra they would be willing to go there for a year. I did not mention rates of pay etc. The immediate result of this was that numbers of men stated that they would be glad to go to Basra to work. I have taken down the names and addresses of men who wish to go and my list now exceeds 1,500 persons who appear to be suitable, though perhaps a proportion of these would not pass the prescribed medical test. I should be grateful if you would inform the recruiting authorities that it is my opinion that at least 2,000 men could be obtained from Bahrain for work in Basra. t Adviser to the Government. i s.z. ^ ^ ^ ' 6 -1 fib- &lt;t,vf Kb/VL. Directorate of Pioneers and Labour, General Headquarters, PAIPORCE. IS February 1943. Dear Wakefield, Just back from Cairo. The situation as regards our show is as follows. There is some doubt as to whether the men will be required or not. Delay in decision has been caused by everyone being snowed under with various JloLs including change in command. I have pointed out again how essential it is to decide one way or the other at an early date. I think if things are on an officer will reach you to make a start by March* I much enjoyed Cairo - everyone full of optimism.Confidential No, C/337 Political Agency, Bahrain, 7th March 1943.

Bahrain for work in Iraq. I believe a large proportion of the men who expressed their willingness to serve in Basra would have no objection to serving ' anywhere '. There is much unemployment in Bahrain owing to no big works being undertaken at present, this, and the great increase in the cost of living, has resulted in about 2000 men being anxious to obtain employment outside Bahrain.

I should be grateful for your comments as to whether I completely misunderstood the position or whether the undesirability of exporting labour to Abadan is involved. Should the latter be the case, I believe that Bahrain labour would be welcomed by the Army for employment in Iraq, as it would then be possible to switch an equivalent number of men now employed in Iraq to Abadan. I am writing to you personally as the labour problem is fortunately not one of my worries and I only became involved in this question through having been on the spot.

Reasons for the changed circumstances are as follows *- (i) Approximately 600 men are being employed by R.N. and R.A.F. on new works. (ii) Construction of extension of Refinery by Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited has already absorbed approximately 500 additional men. A further 500 will be required in August and 1000 - 1500 in Sept ember-October• (iii) Shipping agents will require large amount of additional labour during September-October to deal with heavy imports into Bahrain including — from October onwards — 40,000 tons of material for Refinery extension. 7.
