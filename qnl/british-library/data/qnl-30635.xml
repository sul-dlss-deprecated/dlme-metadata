C I received your letter No.C/201 dated 11th July 1934 concerning the Civil Air Agreement between H.M's Government and my Government and whilst thanking you for it I request that my reply with the following remarks thereon may be forwarded to my friend the Government. Ettifl (1) Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft. (a) Article 4 should read thus*- ”The aircraft shall not use as a place of landing or departure any place other than the aerodromes sanctioned by the Sultan’ 1 . The rest of the article stands as it is. In all the articles where ’’aerodrome or aerodromes occur !, the aerodromes sanctioned by the Sultan* should be substituted. (b) Article 12. It appears that at present the Government of Bombay and the Commissioner in Sind are issuing visas on my behalf without any authority from me These visas are granted to the individuals who desire to visit Muscat, as X have no official representatives in foreign countries I am prepared to authorise the continuance of the issue of such visas by H.M's government as long as I have no representatives in these places. However, I desire that proper arrangement should be made with a view t&lt; preventing the arrival of undesirables in my territories and of other individuals whose visits would not in any way be profitable to my Sultanate. I shall be grateful if H.M T s Government would let me know of their proposal as to what steps are to be taken in the matter. (2) Heads of agreement between H.M’s Government in th&lt; United Kingdom and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.(a) Article 1 should be thus 3 - /ITi i -v Tne Sultan of Muscat agrees to grant H.M's Govern, ment exclusive rights to establish and maintain as his agents, and subject to the provisions of this agreement and of the Air Navigation for Civil Aircraft issued by him,;to construct an aerodrome at Gwadur and a landing ground at ^ inas and ancillary services within the territories of the Suitan 01 Muscat, and to charge fees in respect of the use of these two aerodromes and such ancillary services. (b) Article 2. In paragraph (2) for 'aerodrome or aerddromes' should be substituted 'the said aerodromes'./ / v % y (c) Article 3, *° r 'aerodrome or aerodromes', should be substi- tuted 'the specified aerodromes' 1 . ^ (3) Article 16. The article concerning the Customs dues. It is evident from the proposed arrangements that the stores and materials imported in my territory for the B.a.F. should be subject to custom duty. This is against the principles ; of the exemption of Custom duty which I have accorded to the military forces of H.M's Government oA their stores and materials which are specially imported for the their own use I think that the sanction accorded by me still holds good, that is, the stores and materials of H.A.F. are exempt fa from duty. The Imperial Airways, other Companies and their staff should however pay duty on all their stores which are importea for their own use. But what I would wish to invite the attention of my friend the Government is about the rent of the aerodrome at Gwadur. My Government was the first Independent Government which agreed to grant facili ties for aircraft in the Persian Gulf air service and the first Government which accorded these facilities from 13th November 1929. In vIpw nr m*, the subiect I ^ previous communications on suojsct, I feel confident that the rpnt that date. ent w111 paid froi U.£ #CONFXJaMT 1AL . From To Mo.208/C of 1934.

Drafts of the agreement, in English and Arabic, were delivered to His Highness in June and I have, on two occasions, been very fully through the Agreement to explain points that were not clear to the oultan. 3. His Highness has now raised certain points which are formulated in his letter under reference, Aryi i n conversation Use Sultan has requested that these points may be embodied in an amended agreement. 4.

His Highness stated in conversation that he w ould 8eek extra payment if additional landing grounds »ere »anted. I told him at time that probability 'as unlikely but if a change of lieu 'as sought and an old ground given up for a new, then it 'ould be certain to be regarded as merely an exchange for w hieh extra payment w ould not accrue&lt; He wishes however to safeguard his interests. 2. I consider he w ould accept agreement if he receives separate letter as suggested. 3. Reference your para (3). I consider insertion in Article 16 as suggested appropriate but Sultan proposes to recover Customs duties on petrol, oil, etc. intended for use of other than R.A.F. 4. Reference your para (4). This is Sultan*e intention but wc.pt for material imported by sea, I doubt if he 'ould apply the rule to material brought in by air for emergency. He has no. Customs staff at aerodrome no* and is unlikely to institute any extra staff for the purpose unde^existing circumstances. 5. Your para 5. Yes, I think he Would accept this vie*, the main idea being to keep out agitators and unwanted visitors. 6. I attach greatest importance to getting full payment of arrears ab inititio. Sultan demurred at what he regarded as the small annual remuneration and also w an t e d to have right to fix his oW„ price for foreigners (w h ich he Would asses at double British lutes), j euccess f u ipy rode hlB , off theee pointsI 2 . raises question.

The Political Agent was successful in persuading him not to raise these questions, but states that if he does not get the aerears, the Sultan will certainly revert to them, e have enjoyed civil air facilities at Gwadur without let or hinderance ever since the institution of the air route ana it seems fair (especially having regard to iiultan’s very helpful attitude in the matter of facilities for the KoyAl Air Force) that in return payment should be made for the whole period (though Agreement as in Bahrain and Kuwait would run from the date of signature).

S. 32956/D.D.C. A, AIR MINISTRY, LONDON, W.C.2. 12 th October 1934. Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to India Office letter dated 10th September 1934, No.P.Z. 5737 / 34 ^ forwarding a copy of a despatch from the Political Resident in the xersian Gulf on the subject of the proposed civil air agreement with the Sultan of Muscat. Council note that the Sultan wishes to have -irtiole 1 of the draft Heads of Agreement modified with the object, apparently, of obtaining additional payment for any further civil aerodromes which may subsequently be required for use in his territory in addition to those mentioned in the draft agreement,via: - Gwadur and Shinas. I am to state, for the information of the Secretary °^ a te for India, that the Council are prepared to agree in principle that extra payment should be made for any further landing facilities which may be required and afforded in Muscat territory for the civil air service. They desire, however, that the Agreement with the Sultan should, so far as possible, be in t-ie same terms as those concluded with the Sheiichs of Bahrein and Koweit and, therefore, they would prefer that Article 1 should remain as drafted. 4# Council suggest, therefore, that, subject to Sir Samuel Hoare f s concurrence, the Political Resident should be instructed to approach the Sultan on the lines which he suggests in the second paragraph of his letter. With regard to paragraph 3 of the Political Residents letter the Council note that the Sultan has offered to exempt from payment of Customs duties petrol, oil and stores imported into Muscat for use by the Koyal Air Force, but thathe wishes to ifcvy duties on similar stores imported for use by Imperial Airways Limited. 6 / ■nder Secretary of State. India Office, S.W.l. 6 ./p 1J 2 . I am to say that, as regards 'aircraft and spare parte therefor and aero engines and spare parts therefor' to he used on the civil air service the Council cannot agree that Customs duties sgould he payable, and they note that the Political itesident will press for exemption in respect of this material. 2 he wireless apparatus (including D/F) and spare parts therefor at Gwadur are the property of the Air Council and should also he exempt from Customs duties. 7# As regards the fuel and oil imported for use on the civil air service the Council hope that, as in the cases of Bahrein and Koweit, it may he possible to secure exemption also for this material. They suggest that the Political Resident should he asked to consider whether further representations could he made towards this end, the rental being regarded as an inclusive figure. might, in this connection, he explained to the Sultan that, while His Majesty^ Government do not desire to question his right to levy import duties on petrol and oil, they hope that he will he prepared to agree that corresponding drawbacks should he allowed in respect of such material taken on hoard aircraft of Imperial Airways Limited in Muscat territory for use on the civil air service. tk® question of the arrears to he paid in respect of the use of Gwadur landing ground by Imperial Airways Limited it is noted that the Sultan has asked for and that the Political hesident recommends that payment should he made as from 13th November, 1929. According to Air Ministry records, however, Imperial Airways Limited commenced using Gwadur on 8 th June 1929 and the Council would he prepared to arrange for payment to he made to the Sultan as from the earlier date. In this connection I am to refer to the question of safeguarding the rights of the Royal Air Force to the use of landing grounds and flying boat anchorages in Muscat territory - see/3. see th. d emi official i etter dated 15th May 1934&gt; 3 ^^ from Ur.P.O.L. Bertram to Mr.J.G. Laithwaite. 11 ' Tl18 Counoil are anxious that the civil &gt;h r- vucm, W ie civil air agreement now und er discussion, and particularly , pcrticuiariy tiie proposal to make payment for the use of civil landing grounds in Muscat, shall in no way affect the free user of facilities there at present enjoyed hy Boyal Air Force aircraft, nor any additional ones whxch may be acquired in the future. The Council assume that as in the cases of the Bahrein and Soweit civil air agreements, the Political Hesident will be instructed to negotiate for an exchange of letters safeguarding this point. 12 ' “ the SultaJ1 P r0Tes difficult on this question of free user by the Royal Air Force the Political Resident might counter by suggesting that the amount of the arrears payment should be at a lower rate than £500 per annum seeing that ' Qwadur only has hitherto been used by the civil air service. 13 ‘ ThS C ° UnCil d0 not desir « that this point should be stressed, however, or even raised at all, except in the event of lt9 neoessa ^ to curb any rapacity which may be evinced by the Sultan in the negotiations. 14 ‘ A copy of this letter has been sent to the Fceign Office, X am, &amp;c., (Sgd,) J.S.

INDIA Oi^lGE, LONDON t &amp;.w # 1. 9th January, 1935, My dear iPowle, 1 venture to bother you on one or two points which have risen on the 'specal authorisations' recently i 88U e d in favour of Imperial Airways, etc, by the Shaikh of Bahrain, copies of which you sent us under cover of your printed despatch Io.ll70-S of loth December. 2 * ln the 1irat Place the word 'British' appears to have been omitted before the word 'natibnal ity' in paragraph 1 in all three cases. This is no doubt merely a clerical err or, 3. Secondly, paragraph 2 does not la, down a time limit for the validity of 'special authorisstione'. It was originally intended that there should be such a time limit (as is, I think, clear from the form of the draft 'special authorisation' prepared here after consultation with you), but I am afraid that owing to an oversight we failed to suggest *hat the actual period of validity should be . After informal consultation withthe Air Ministry we now suggest that the period in question should be one year. This will of course mean that companies operating air services will have to apply annually through the usual channels for a renewal of their 'special authorisations'. Paragraph 2 should therefore read ”™ 8 auth °‘-isation is limited to the period from (Insert date issue of authorisation) to ( ) i„ 0 i U8 i Ve i8 gr&amp;nt ^ ed 4# While the points referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are of relatively minor importance, we think, in light of discussion with the Air Ministry, that it would be desirable to obtain amended 'authorisations' from the Shaikh of Bahrain and to ensure that any authorisations issued by the Shaikh of Kuwait) o d &gt;o ni? m M 10 }da B i •• ido Od - 2 - and the Sultan of Muscat are in 8 i milar form .

Before proceeding to discuss the desirability of certain alterations in the wording of the Air Agreement, I will, if I may, deal with the following minor points. 3. We should he glad, in the first place, to know whether the Air Council agree that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company j through their agents at Gwadur, should be appointed suppliers for the purpose of certifying the quantity of fuel issued for the exclusive use of Imperial Airways under paragraph 15 of the Heads of Agreement between Kis Majesty*s Government and His Highness? 4. i/ill you be so kind also as to confirm that you seeno IW x objection to the new paragraph 16 which has been inserted in the Heads of Agreement? 5* You will see that Major Bremner is taking steps to obtain from the Sultan the necessary letter in regard to the use of aerodromes by military aircraft and tjie continued provision of free tacilities for Service machines • He has aLso been instructed to take steps to obtain the necessary special authorisations for the use of Muscat territory by machines of Imperial Airways• F .G.L.Bertram,Hsq.,C.B.E., Gwydyr House, Whitehall,S-W.1. 6. /- 2 - 6. From my letter of 4th January, No. P.z.66/35, to Burkett, you will see that we have further asked Colonel Fowle to confirm our assumption that tfce drawback under nrticle 15 of the Air Agreement will operate as from the date of signature of the Agreement. We have also raised with him the question of the method of payment of the arrears (and in future of the annual rent under the Agreement) due to the Sultan. It seems not unlikely to prove simplest in practice that the Resident should issue this amount locally on behalf of the Air Ministry, the necessary adjustment being made between the India Office and the Air Ministry, but we can leave this point over until we receive Colonel Fowle-s reply. 7* It has occurred to us in connection with the agreement which has now been signed that it may be well at this stage to take up with the Sultan of Muscat, in the same way as in agreement with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office we have taken it up previously with the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, the question of advising His Highness definitely to prohibit civil aircraft, whether commercial or private (with the exception, of course, of Imperial Airways) from flying over or landing in the Arabian territories of Muscat, save with the specific prior permission of the Sultan. The effect of such prohibition would, of course, be to confine civil air craft in general so far as Muscat territory is concerned, to Gwadur, the position of which is quite different, and where the special considerations which have cade us think it desirable to preclude private flights on the Arabian augix mainland do not operate. We are inclined to think that this point could on the whole probably most satisfactorily be covered by slight modifications in the text of the Civil air Agreement /9. / -3- Agreement the effect of which would, be to restrict (save in the case of Imperial Airways, for whom a special route would be laid down) civil aircraft to Gwadur. We regard it as of some importance in view of the fact that the various parts of the Civil Air Agreement, other than the confidential Heads of Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan, will ultimately be published, that the terms of the Regulations should ma^e it clear that civil aircraft in general are m not permitted to fly over Muscat territory other than Gwadur* 8. We are inclined, in these circumstances, subject to your comments and those of the Foreign Office, to suggest the following minor modifications in the Air Navigation Regulations and the connected papers (other than the Heads of Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan, in which no modification will be necessary). Air Navigation Regulations* ■ h lii 5 Paragraph 4 * Insert at the beginning 'save with the 1 Specific prior permission of the Sultan'. Substitute 'Gwadur' for 'Muscat”. For 'aerodromes' read 'aerodrome”. Paragraph 11 * Substitute 'Gwadur' for 'Muscat”. f&gt; l*1U Paragraph 13 * After 'Muscat' where mentioned insert the word 'territory'. Conditions governing the use of the aerodrome In the heading substitute 'Gwadur' for 'Muscat”, alternatively we might omit the words 'in Muscat' altogether? The notice would be posted at Gwadur aerodrome and could be given a general heading 'Gwadur Aerodrome'. Special Authorisation. In the heading insert the word 'territory' after 'Muscat?. Redraft to read: 'The aircraft shall not, 1*1 Paragraph 2(ii) . Redraft to read: 'The aircraft shall ] save with tne special permission of His Highness the Sultan, fly over the Arabian territories of His Highness or use as a place of landing or departure within Muscat territory any place other than the aerodrome at Gwadur and...'* -4- I U 9. In the event of the modifications suggested above being accented the Sultun will be invited to grant in the case of Imperial Airways, in a separate letter, special permission to fly across the tip of the Musandim Peninsula along the route already agreed between us, and in the event of emergency to land at Shinas. 10. Would you be so kind as to let me know whether the Air Ministry would see any objection to action on these lines? 11. A further pnifct for consideration on which we should welcome your views and those of the Foreign Office is whether, in the event of the Sultan agreeing to exclude private fliers from his dominions on the Arabian mainland, we need insist on the issue of a special authorisation to private fliers (as opposed to . ' ^^r~TrTrnri-irn i—V , , 11111 , 11 , 1 , _ „ ,| MIM m r-t- 11 n— &gt;fy—♦ regular air services) in respect of Gwadur or whether we might agree that private fliers should be permitted, as hitherto, to fly over or land at Gwadur without a special authorisation, so Ion# as the necessary visa has first been obtained by them? I am not quite clear what the present position is in regard to private flights along the Persian coast and there might be something to be said for making the procedure at Gwadur conform to that which obtains in respect of aerodromes along the old Imperial Airways route. If the Persians insist on a special authorisation being obtained in respect of landings in their territory by private fliers, there is no reason why we should not do the same at Gwadur. 12. On the pbint discussed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Colonel Fowle’s express letter 1169-S of 10th December, we are disposed, subject to your observations and those of the Foreign Office, to agree with the Resident that it is unnecessary for His Majesty*s Government to make a special approach to His Highness. It will however in due course be necessary for the K.L.k. to obtain /jj*') ,s- obtain authoi'isations in the sanctioned form for their flights over and calls at Gwadur. Would you be so kind as to let me s:: know your views? 13. I am taking up with the Foreign Office in the letter of which I enclose a copy the point raised in paragraph 6 of Colonel Fowle‘s express letter of 10th December. 14. We should be grateful if you could let us have your comments on the poiits raised above as early as possible. The Sultan is now proposing to return to Muscat on 30th January and it seems desirable to approach him without delay on his return about any alterations which we may wish to make in the Agreement^etc • Apart from thisj you will agree that the sooner we reach finality as regards the terms of the Air Agreement, the authorisations, etc. and dispose of the various minor points which are still outstanding, the better. 15. I am sending a copy of this letter to Kendel.

You will see that Fowle, in paragraph 6 of his express letter of 10th December, 1169-S, again referred to the desirability of a formal application by the French Government requesting permission to fly over and land at Gwadur.

While authorisation in case ol commercial aircraft is a matter of no difficulty as such cr^ft fly regularly over the route and are given an authorisation only once a year, application to the Gultan for each casual flight, and such flights may be expected to increase in number* as tl d ^oes on, will lead to delay and correspondence which saoula be avoided if possible. There are two ways in which this can be effected* U) by amending the uegulatioi*s so taat no authorisation is necessary for private iliers, or (b) b^ asking the Sultan to delegate his authority for grant-ng authorisation to the Government of India for flights starting from India, and to His Majesty's u&gt;verament for those start ing iron England.

Dear Laithv/aite, Thank you for your letter of 8th instant, P.Z.7940/34, on the subject of the Civil Air Agreement which has been concluded with the Sultan of Muscat. We have the following observations to offer on the various points which you have raised:- Paragraph 5. We agree that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company through their agents at Gwadur should be appointed suppliers for the purpose of certifying the quantity of fuel issued for the exclusive use of Imperial Airways Ltd. under paragraph 15 of the Heads of /agreement with the Sultan. Paragraph 4. We see no objection to the new paragraph 16 which has been inserted in the Heads of Agreement. We are considering the question whether His Majesty’s Government or Imperial Airways Ltd.should be responsible for the nominal monthly rent and perhaps you would let us know in due course the amount involved. fanagraph 5, Your observations are noted. Paragraph 6. We note the points you have raised with Colonel Fowle and that you will await his reply before considering the matters further. Paragraph 7. We certainly agree that civil aircraft other than those of Imperial Airways should be prohibited from flying over or landing in the Arabian territories of Muscat save with the specific prior permission of the Sultan. We also agree that the Air2, Navigation Regulations should he amended so as to make this point clear to all concerned. With regard to your draft amendments to the Regulations,etc. it vrauld appear that you have proceeded on the assumption that civil aircraft other than those of Imperial Airways Ltd. should not use Gwadur except with the prior permission of the Sultan. As you know, private aircraft and aircraft engaged on occasional commercial flights have made use of Gwadur now for some years past and it has never been the practice to seek the previous consent of the Sultan for such flights. We should he very much averse to disturbing thid position particularly in view of the time which v/ould elapse in each case in obtaining the Sultan's permission (presumably action would have to be taken through your Department and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf). We hope, therefore, that the Sultan will be prepared to continue this principle of freedom of innocent passage for occasional flights across his territory on the ncrfch side of the Gulf of Oman including landings at Gwadur. If he seems likely to object it might be pointed out to him that the facilities have been afforded for some years now and are in accordance with the practice which is now almost universally adopted towards private and other occasional flights. As regards the amendments which will bw required to give effect to the foregoing we suggest the following for your consideration. AIR NAVIGATION REGULATIONS. Heading: Add 'and Oman” after 'MUSCAT”. Divide Paragraph 1 into three parts as follows Paragraph 1 (i ) Insert after 'land in the” the words 'Arabian territories of Muscat” in place of 'territory of Muscat”.on Pc»r:irjr_ai3h__l i v ii) « Aircraft engaged in regular air services shall not fly over the territories of Muscat the nortli side of the Gulf of Oman or land at Gwadur except under the special authorisation issued hy His Highness the Sultan. —A' 1i --)« Aircraft other than those engaged in regular air services .way fly over the territories Highness The Sultan on the north side of the Gulf of Oman and land at Gwadur without such special authoris ation• £-hll a f r fiP n Delete the words 'so authorised'.Insert the words 'and Oman' after 'Muscat'. Insert before 'such other supplementary conditions' as the commencement of a second sentence to this paragraph the words 'Aircraft whose flight is authorised under Paragraphs 1 (i) and (ii) above shall in addition comply with'. A ara r ra 'ph 4 V Insert after 'place' in line 2 the words in muscat and Oman'. For 'the aerodrome at Muscat' substitute 'an aerodrome approved for the purpose by His Highness the Sultan'. Paragraph 11. Insert the word 'at' after 'abroad' in j-ine 1. Substitute for the v/ords 'Muscat Aerodrome' the words 'aerodromes in the territory of Muscat and Oman'. Paragraph 13 For 'Muscat' substitute 'the territory of Muscat and Oman'. CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USD OF THE AERODROME. We agree with your suggestions. The heading would then be, GWADUR AERODROME. CONDITIONS LAID DOWN WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE SULTAN TO' GOVERN THF USE OF THE AERODROME. A similar form f mutatis mutandis r could be used forShinas and for any other civil aerodromes which may be used in the territory. SPECIAL AUTHORISATION. Heading: Add u and Oman' after 'Muscat' in both places. Paragraph 1. Add the words 'and Oman' after 'The Sultan of Muscat'. Substitute in line 2 for the word 'Muscat' the words 'his territory'. Paragraph 2 (ii). It seems to us that, so far as Imperial Airways are concerned, it might be desirable to leave this sub-paragraph in its present form, provision being made in line 3 for landings at two places, viz. Gwadur and Shinas. With regard to the suggestions in paragraph 9 of your letter, while we agree that the Sultan should be asked to grant, in a separate letter, special permission for Imperial Airways aircraft to fly across the tip of Musandim Peninsula it seems unnecessary to obtain his special per mission, other than in the form of the special authorisation (valid for Gv/adur and Shinas), for the use of Shinas. In the cases, hov/ever, of the Dutch and French air services which at present make occasional landings at Gwadur, we agree that the wording suggested in your letter (adding perhaps 'and Oman' after 'Muscat' for consistency)for this sub-paragraph should be used in the authorisations to be issued 'by The Sultan. If and when these services (or other services) are authorised to fly over the Arabian territories of Muscat the present form of authorisation, as suggested for Imperial Airways Ltd. could be used. There is a further point v/hich arises in connection with 'the Schedule headed 'Extract from Air Ministry Notice to Airmen', and to which attention was previously drawn in respect °f the Bahrein and Koweit Agreements (see my letter dated 3rd November, 1934, numbered as above and your reply thereto of7th November, 1934, P.2.6845/34). The ’'Extract” in question shoulu, vc oU£j&lt;qeot, be headed at tne top '’Schedule X” and ocheaule II as a heading to housing Pees should be deleted As regards the Schedule of charges for attendance and other facilities (referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Heads of Agreement and also in paragraph 3 of the ’’Conditions governing the use of the Aerodrome' and intended to be Schedule II to th^Agreement) you will recall that a list of the charges proposed to be made by Imperial Airways Lta. Vo.o communicated to the india Office with my letter dated 21st August 1933, No. 248985/33/D.f. C .A. at least so far as private aircraft are concerned. I enclose a further ^ copy lor ease of reference. In subsequent correspondence on the question of including also in the Schedule the charges for use of the aerodromes by public transport aircraft it was agreed that it was unnecessary to publish these charges until sucn time as foreign air services are permitted to use the Arabian Coast aerodromes. 1 Prench and Dutch use Gwadur, however, we are asking Imperial Airways to let us have a list of their proposed charges for public transport aircraft for inclusion ln Schedule II to the Gwadur Agreement. I will forward the list tdferou as soon as it is received. Paragraph IP., v/e agree with the Political Resiaent that it is unnecessary to approach the Sultan again for permission for the Dutcli to fly over his territory on the north side of the Gulf of Oman and to land at Gwadur. The Dutch will, however, have to obtain special authorisation in the agreed form and we assume that, in v -iew of paragraph 5 of the Heads of Agreement, the Company should be instructed to make the necessary application through the Political Resident at Bushi re. Perhaps you willconsider and let me know whether the Political Resident should prompt the Dutch Company in this matter or whether action should he taken hy the Air Ministry. Paragraph 13. We note th- action you have taken with the Foreign Office regarding the question of permission for the French company to use Gwadur. £. a . r Ag r,a ]lIl 14.. We certainly agree that it is desirable to have all the above mentioned points cleared up as soon as possible. There do not appear to/any amendments required in this connection to the Heads of Agreement and in any case it is presumably undesirable that they should have to be amended so soon after signature.

We had hoped to be able to get off a letter to you by to-day^ air mail about these, but we hope that the letter may issue by the air mail of 2nd February. The modifications, as you will see, are practically all of relatively minor importance, with the exception of the proposed advice to the Sultan that he should prohibit private flights over his Arabian dominions (save to the extent that he agrees to flights by Imperial Airways over the tip of the Musandim i-eninsula), and we hope that Bremner will not have difficulty in securing His Highness’s agreement to them once our official request reaches you. Yours sincerely, sd.J.G.Laithwaite• The Hon’ble Lt.Col.T.C.Fowle,C.B.E., Bushire.(Received under India Office Printed Letter No. P.Z.401-35 of 18th January 1935. ) (E 176/17/91). Foreign Office,S.W.l. 18th January 1935. Rendel has asked me to reply to your letter No.PZ.7940/34 of the 8th January to him about the Muscat Civil Air Agreement and to let you know our views on the various points which you have raised in that letter and in your letter of the same number and date to Bertram at the Air Ministry, a copy of which was enclosed in it. 2* (a) Permission for French aircraft to use Gwadur . As I have already explained to you over the telephone, it seems to us that in his express letter No*1169-S of the 10th December, Fowle has misconceived the present position. In their note of the 6th September 1933, a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No .E.5287/11/91 of the 14th September, 1933, to the India Office, the French Government stated that the French Consul at Bushire had already approached the Sultan of Muscat with regard to this question. Whether the Sultan ever replied to that commhnica- tion does not appear from our papers; he may of course have done so without our being aware of the fact, any more thcin we were aware of the French Consul f s approach until the French Government told us of it* In any case we suggest that before we make any further enquiries of the French Government Fowle might be asked to enquire what reply, if any, was returned to the French Consult representations. 3. (b). Prohibition of flights by civil aircraft over the Arabian dominbns of the Sultan of Muscat . We agree generally with the views expressed in your letter to Bertram and we also concur in the detailed amendments in the Air Navigation / •G.Laithwaite Esq.,C.I.E.Na/i)g&amp; wiuxi Reguxatioiks and. coniiactad papers wiiich you propose in paragraph 8 of that letter. ^• (c) Xhsis tsnce on special authorisation for private using Gwadur . The Persian Government require private lliers who desire to pass over or land in Persia to apply for permission to doso. We see no reason, there fore, why the Sultan of Muscat should not equally insist on this requirement, if you consider it desirable that he should. 5. Finally, with reference to paragraph 12 of your letter to Bertram, we agree that there appears to be no necessity for obtaining the Sultan's formal sanction for the use of Gwadur by the Dutch. But presumably if or when the Dutch and French start using the Arab Coast route, special permission will be sought from the Sultan for their aircraft to fly over the Musandim Peninsula. 6.

Political Resident, at Bahrain From Secretary of State for India, London To Repeated Government of India, New Delhi. Air Officer Commanding, Iraq. Political Agent, Bahrain. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Subject : Air facilities on Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. N Please refer to Air Ministry letters No .S.34954/S .6 of 18th January 1935 (P.Z.395/35 of 8 th February 1935), and No .3.34954/S .6 of 14th February 1935 (P.Z.1094/35 ol 15th February x935), the former of which contained a Provisional List of the further facilities required, which List was confirmed in paragraph 4 ol the latter. 2. Of the facilities noted in the List, I am concerned with the following places: Nos.1. Kuwait. 3. Bahrain. 4. Halul. 5.Yas. 6 . Das. 7. Abu Dhabi. 8 .Sharjah. 9.Kalba. 12. Gwadur. (For facility of reference I have numbered the Air Ministry's No.2 is Saudi territory. No.10 is in Persia, while List) ( Designation)3. Nos .5 and 7 have been obtained - vide my Express Letter No*C/13 of 22nd February 1935. Nos.li, 13 and 14 are the concern of the Government of India. 3fhe facilities required with which I am concerned can be divided into two categories: ' ^ 1 A# T « rri torie» where we have obtained general facilities under respective Civil Air Agreements. This comprises Nos.l, 3 , 8 and 12 . B. This comprises two areas in Abu Dhabi territory (Nos.4 and 6 ) and Kalba (No.9). in the former territory we have merely obtained certain specific facilities limited to areas Nos.5 and 7, and in Kalba territory we have obtained no facilities at all. 5. I agree, however, with the^ir Ministry (paragraph 3 oi their letter of 18th January) that in the territories in A (Nos.l, 3, 8 and 12) the extra facilities now required can ins called as a matter of course and without raising the subject with the Shaikhs. Should the latter make objections we can quite fairly explain to them that the beacons, wireless and meteorological stations are part of the normal organization connected with landing grounds. Category B is however on a different footing. Before I give an opinion on the best way of obtaining facilities in territories under category B I would be grateful if I could be assured that these represent the final require ments of the Air Ministry, at all events for a period of say two years. A piecemeal method of obtaining air facilities from Shaikhs, as I pointed out before, renders a far from easy task still more difficult, and may also prove more expensive to His Majesty's Government. If the information, for instance, as to the air facilities at Halul and Das Islands had been received /-3- received by me in time it would have been convenient to have tried to obtain t^em at the same time as the others dealt with by Colonel Loch inhis recent negotiations (vide my letter of 22nd February already quoted), 8 . If therefore there is any doubt as to whether any further facilities should be added to the Air Ministry List it would be much preferable that further consideration should be given to this matter. This further consideration may lead to a slight delay in dealing with the facilities under category Bj but in the meantime the Royal Air Force can commence installing those under category A. sd• T•C.Fowle Lieut.-Colonel Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Attested.

Ill, 240 gallons, duty about Rs.iO/-. Now according to the agreement was concluded i October last between ourselves and our friend H.M's Government we M to refund the Customs duty which has been collected on the petrol usiimed by the planes of that Company during the year. Since the conclusion of the above agreement Hir service of Imperial Airways has doubled and and it is said that may be even still further increase. Even as things are,the amount that we refund oil and petrol is greater than that which we receive for the aerodrome Handing ground at Gwadur and Shinas respectively.Any increase of the •dee will mean an even greater loss to us. The Government is well aware of the financial ^ition of our state and we feel confident that it was never their ^ntion that we should thus be put to such great loss by the conclusion 16 agreement.On the contrary we think that our friend the Government ed that we should be benifited by the agreement. We request therefore that you will bring the ker to the attension of H.MVs Government and this matter may be revised light of actual facts. Your sicere Friend The Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman. mxL AURGENT. CONFIDENTT^. No.C/162 of 1936. Political Agency 4 H.B.M'e Consulate, Muscat f 2nd June 1936. From Major CaJS.u.Bremner, Political Agent 4 H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Subject*- Civil Air Agreement* Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the copy of a letter dated 1st June 1935 received from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat concerning the rebate of Customs duty which, under the terms of the ttlvil Air Agreement, he is bound to make to Messrs the Imperial Airways, the constituted Agents of Government. 2. His Highness unfortunately did not mention the matter to me at Gwadur, where the figures could have been checked in situ, but in the course of a recent conversation with me, he showed me his own Arabic notes culled from the Customs records. There appears no reason to doubt these records as they were personally inspected by His Highness. 3. Assuming therefore that His Highness's figures are correct, it would appear that whereas he receives only Hs 6,750 (£ 500 &amp; ft 13/8) p.a. as consideration for the use of Gwadur aerodrome, he repays ft 7,620 on Customs rebate and is actually out of pocket ft 870/- on the whole transaction, apart from the major loss to his revenues.- 2 - ■ 4. It would certainly appear that when the clause^ dealing with customs rebate on fuel and oil was being evolved no one realised the amounts involved. Certainly His Highness did not and, as I am not sufficient* acquainted with requirements of large aircraft in such matters, I was not in a position to draw attention to the fact myself. 5. As His Highness points out the service has been doubled since the Agreement was concluded, and a further increase is rumoured, to the great detriment of the State revenues. That the Sultan should be at a loss over the Agreement, is obviously not the intention of His Majesty's ernment. a modification therefore of clause 15 of the Heads of the Civil Air Agreement would appear essential, waereby the rebate on fuel and oils should either be cancelled, or so modified, that the Sultan is not called or virtually to pay Government for the privilege of having an aerodrome in his territories. in forwarding the matter for your early consideration i would strongly recommend that action on the above lines may be taken. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. ' Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. ASN.© GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department. A iA Coni' J5KSIAJJ aULF.

Sultan’s letters of 19th May and ??6th June 1934 to French Consul, Bushire, ( endr sed with my Express Letter of 15th May 1935 ) show that he wished to obtain paynent froa Air Orient in return for permission to use Owadur. These letters were however written before Sultan conduced the Civil Air Agreement, and as under Article 1 of that Agreement Sultan has granted to H.M*s. Government the exclusive right to charge fees, the question of payment to Sultan does not arise. French civil aircraft would therefore appear to he in the same position as Patch ana I am of opinion that action similar to that being taken in regard to the K.L.M. should be token in regard to AirFrance without further reference to friltan, i.e. that the French Government should be informed that AirFrance should apply to.tha Multan through me for special authorisation for their aircraft to use Gwadur.

A. 1 5th June 1935 \ Dear Laithwaite, I am sorry that there has been some delay in replying to your letter dated 8th April last, P.Z.2361/35, with which you enclosed an original Special Authorisation issued by the Sultan of Muscat in favour of Imperial Airways Limited. With regard to the small clerical errors in the Authorisation, to which you drew attention, we agree that, as the registration markings of the aircraft havebeen quoted correctly in this case, and to save the bother of sending the Authorisation back to Muscat, the errors might be ignored. We have, therefore, had photostatic copies made of the Special Authorisation for sending to Imperial Airways Limited. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter, we think that on the whole it would have been preferable not to have sub-divided the aircraft into those making regular flights and those making emergency flights. In point of fact, three of the aircraft in the first mentioned sub-division, namely, G-ABTK, G-ABTL and G-AASP should have been included in the list of aircraft required to make emergency flights and conversely, aircraft G-AAXE is engaged on the regular service. As you will appreciate, it may at any time become ; Laithwaite Esq., pfoa Office, necessary/ S.W.l.necessai y fop IinpGpial Aipways Limitsd. t-o utilisG aircpaff listed under the second sub-division on their regular service flights. \i q suggest, therefore, that when the renewal of this authorisation becomes due the whole of the list of aircraft should be shown v/ithout any sub—division. We note that you enclosed with your letter the original of a further Authorisation signed and sealed by the Sultan on the 20th March. We are not sure why this Authorisation was signed as no aircraft company is mentioned in it and we assume that it has only been forwarded for reference purposes. In this connection you will be aware that the Special Authorisation issued to Imperial Airways Limited by the Shaikh of Kuwait expired on the 22nd May 1935, and I shall be glad to know whether a renewal of the Authorisation has yet been obtained.

Both ior this reason and in view of the desirability of retaining the confidence and : ^ood will of the rulers concerned, His Lordship trusts that the proposals of the Political Resident will receive the oympathetic consideration of the Air Council, whose views lie would be ^lad to learn at an early date. Copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am etc., (Sd.) M.J .CL ARSON, ! cre tary, Ministry.V \ / ✓ J 1 RS.32956 II/D.D.C.A Sir » AIR MITISTRY, LOYDOl'T, W.C. 2. 31st August, 1935. I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to India Office letter of the 2nd August, ITo. P. Z. 5028/ ^0, in regard to the exemption frcm Customs duty of petrol and oil imported into Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit, for the use of Imperial Airways, Ltd. 2. I am to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India that Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister concurs in the view that there is a case for re-examining the effect of the Civil Air Agreements with the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheilchs of Bahrein and Koweit. 3. It seems to Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister, however, that if the concession proposed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is made in the form suggested by him, it will be extremely difficult to avoid continuing it on the same basis in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme. This would, of course, involve much larger payments than those now in question. With five services a week instead of two, and having regard to the heavier type of aircraft to be used, the liability would be trebled, anc would thus in each case amount to £750 per annum in addition to the annual rental of £500 paid to each of the three Rulers. 4. It is not considered that this Department should be committed to payment of more than £250 a year in each case, especially having regard to the pressure which is being applied to the Governments of Iraq, Palestine and Sgypt to give remission in full in connection with the Empire I i* / : Tnder Secretary of State, Political Department, India Office, S.W.l.Air Mail Scheme* 1 2 . /7 t 5- It is suggested therefore that, in all three cases, petrol and oil should be exempted from Customs and other duties a payment being made not exceeding £250 per annum to each Ruler, in part compensation, although it should be clearly provided that this payment will be the maximum whatever the actual consumption of petrol and oil may be. It seems essential to make it clear that the agreement will cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 onwards* 6* Sir j?hilip Cunl iff e-Lis ter presumes that if this suggestion commends itself to Lord Zetland there would be no diifl culty in securing an amendment of the current Civil Air Agreements or, alternatively, in negotiating fresh agreements, say, for a period of five years from 1st January 1936* 7. It seems preferable that a similar arrangement for the payment of this ’'compensation’' should, if possible, be made in all three cases. The present procedure in Muscat, under which the Cultan is called upon to make a substantial disbursement annually, tenas to focus his discontent* 8. The object which the Political Agent has in view would in this manner be equally well achieved as each Ruler would b enefit to the extent of £250 per annum. On the other hand, excessive liability for Air Funds in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme would be avoided* 9. in regard to refundment of duties under the current Muscat Agreement, I am to forward herewith a copy of a letter dated 21st August from Imperial Airways Limited# Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister will be glad to be furnished with any observations that Lord Zetland may wish to offer with reference to the second paragraph- 10.

After considerable discussion on the subject in which His Highness showed a desire to go with great care into the detailed figures of his probable losses or gains unuer the various suggestions for altering the present system, I was able to persuade him tc agree to accept (subject, of course, to the final approval of His Majesty*s Government), the offer of a lump sum payment of £ 250 per annum, in compensation for the loss of duty on petrol and oil consumed by the extra aeroplanes of the Imperial airways passing through Gwadur, irrespective s. e._ o _ • irrespective of possible further expansions of the Company^ services.
