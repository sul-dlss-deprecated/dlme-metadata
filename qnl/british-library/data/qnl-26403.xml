P. A.K. Harrison, Hsq. , Commonwealth relations Office, King Charles Street, Whitehall, 3.W. 1. Yours sincerely,•^■LCr. fci fin'***' 1. Please see the Deed of Further Modification flagged at A. Under Article A(b) BAFCQ are given , *the exclusive right to construct and operate refineries and storage tanks ^ Under Article lX G ) is specifically stated that the above does 'not include the exclusive right to sell or transport petroleum products • 2. The question came up before in connection with the construction of storage tanks for R.a.F. and B.O.A.C. - our standpoint was that under the G.A. Agreement H.M.G. have exclusive rights to 'establish and maintain an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services' and are permitted to import duty free petrol and oil for refuelling aircraft. 3. BAK50 stated in 1944 that they would contest the erection of aircraft fuel storage tanks as an infringement of monopoly - it was finally decided (October, 1945) to make no approach to BAPCO but to set up the tanks and let them complain if they wanted to - which they do not appear to have done. 4. As A.I.O.G. have been selling their wares in Bahrein (as stated in paragraph 2 of the P.A. *s letter of 1.9.47) the problem resolves itself into the question as to whether within the meaning of the 'Deed' 2 x 1,000 gallon tanks can be termed 'storage tanks' (The aerodrome tanks were 114 tons capacity each,). As presumably A.I.O.C. are already using drums, perhaps 20 or 2+0 gallons each - two 1,000 gallon tanks could scarcely be an infringement of monopoly - any more than the maintenance of two for the same purpose. 5. I suggest the action suggested in the first half of the P.R. *s paragraph 3 should be taken. '''J© Political Resident, Bahrain. H.M’s Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, London Repeated Political Agent, Bahrain (with Blue Print NO.R30825, returned). No.1615-S Dated the 6th September, 1947. Copy is enclosed of Bahrain Memorandum No.C/931, dated the 1st September, 1947, regarding the proposal of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to modernise their existing filling station, or to set up a new one, in Bahrain. 2. Article 4(b) of the Deed of Furtner Modification does give the Bahrain Petroleum Company the exclusive right to construct and operate storage tanks. The Company claimed this right in respect of the tankage required for the British Overseas Airways Corporation and the Royal Air Force (vide India Office Express Letter No.2960/45 dated 3rd July, 1945, and connected correspondence;. Such tankage was. howeve^*, commercial bulk tankage (two tanks of 114 tons each;. The position is not free from doubt but I am of the opinion that the installation and operation of two 1,000 gallon tanks to facilitate retail sales at a filling station would not amount to an infringement of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's exclusive rights, as these reservoirs cannot reasonably be held to constitute storage tanks within the meaning of Article 4(b) of the Deed of Further Modificat ion. 3. I am not in favour of adopting the suggestion in paragraph 4 of the Political Agent's Memorandum as this would indicate to the Bahrain Petroleum Company that we admit their right to object or, at any rate, that we are in doubt regarding the position. Snould His Majesty's Government concur in the opinion expressed in paragraph 2 above I suggest that I should be authorised to inform the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company tnat there is no objection on tne part of His Majesty's Government to their carrying out their plans; and to leave it to the Bahrain Petroleum Company to raise objection if they think fit. Should, however, His Majesty's Government consider that the installation and operation of this tankage v/ould amount to a violation of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's exclusive rights I suggest that I should be authorised to inform the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company accordingly, and to advise them to come to an agreement in the matter direct with tne Bahrain Petroleum Company.

Hitherto, the Anglo-Iranian Oil company’s product, B.O. motor spirit, has been sold commercially in Manama from drums. 3. The Bahrain petroleum Company have already endeavoured to reserve their rights under Article 4(b) of the Deed of Further Modification in respect of tanks erected on land at Muharraq leased to the Air Ministry for defence purposes; and it appears unlikely that they will agree to this installation for commercial purposes - at any rate without consideration. 4.

The Mr Ministry’s letter referred to is No.C.S.22257/S.9(0) of 15th Juno, 1945. In the telegram the words ’’held up” should be substituted for 'under his endorsement” • 2. Circumstances have of course altered since your letter of 15 th June was sent, and, so far as we can judge here, we should have thought it better that, for the moment, nothing should be said to the Bahrein Petroleum Company locally on the subject of installing tanks, but that it should bu left to the Bahrein Petroleum Company here to raise this issue if they must. This seems to be in accordance with paragraph 11 of the Note of the Meeting at the Ministry of Fuel and Power on 14th September. Moreover we arc now, as you know, contemplating the early extension of the Bahrein Civil Mr Agreement, and it is desirable that legal argument with B.A.P.C.O. should be postponed until negotiations are concluded. 3. Perhaps therefore you would, if you see no objection, ask A.O.C. Iraq to postpone action on the proposed letter to B.A.P.C.C. for the time being as Colonel Galloway has suggested. 4.

I have looked into the matter and our information is that, the Customs import duty, which is ba&amp;ed on 5$ tt ad valorem' yields to the Bahrein Government £1: 2s: 3d per ton as compared with the ‘royalty accruing from indigenous production, a figure I imagine of the order of Sh.6/- to 7/- per ton. It would*appear, therefore, that on financial considerations alone the imported product will not be to the disadvantage of'the Bahrein Government. You will be pleased to know that the’whol^ subject of supply at Bahrein has developed rapidly over the last few days, and we have been requested by the Air Ministry to make sui)plies of Abadan fuel available in Bahrein in quantity sufficient to meet the total requirements of British aircraft landing there. Y/e have undertaken to do this at the earliest possible moment and have already acquired a coasting tanker which “/ill leave this country for the Persian Gulf about the 4th October and should be in a position to lake up the traffic early in November. Until that date we are arranging transport from Abadan to Bahrein on an improvised basis*INDIA OFFICE, Ext, 4226/4-5 WHITEHALL, S.W.l. PTjtfoSepteiriber, 1945. Dear Jones, } enclose herer.dth a copy of a Note by Sir Geoffrey Prior 1 .^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (now on leave in this country) in which he suggests that it would be opportune to secure at an early date the agreement of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the extension lor another 10 years of the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement which is due to expire at the end of 1943. His suggestion has been put forward in connection with the question of the erection of oil tanks for the supply of aviation fuel at Bahrein. You were concerned with the latter question at an earlier stage but / '^PP 62 -- 1 ^ Nave attended the latest meeting held by the / ministry of Fuel and Power on 14th September, of which I enclose a note, _ Sir Geoffrey Prior is due to return to the Gulf via Banrcin in about a month’s time and if sanction is obtained here to the proposal, he could probably negotiate an extension of the agreement when he reaches Bahrein. We should not wish to delay the arrangements which the Air Kinistry are proposing to make with A. 1.0, C. for the supply of aviation fuel from Abadan, but it may be possible to arrange an extension of the agreement before our intentions in the matter of bulk storage tanks are revealed to B.A.P.C.O. and they connect the matter with our rights under the Civil Air Agreement. 3._ We shall be glad to know your views on Sir Geoffrey Prior's suggestion that he might offer some increased rate of payment to the Sheikh. We appreciate that there may be some difficulty in securing^ at short notice, financial sanction for an increase of the present rates and it may be better to leave this^ aspect until renewal of the agreement has been broached to the Sheikh. We should, however, be glad if you could let us know the exact sum which H.k.G. arc at present paying to the Major H. Jones, /Sheikh Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ariel House, W.C.2.—NOTE BY SIR GEOFFREY PRIOR Our position, nov/ rests entirely on the Civil Air d ^ C to cx P ire ^ 1948, and I feel that our first act should be to renew it for another ten years. We could explain to the Shaikh that heavy capital expenditure is ^ G ^ h e ? plated ’ ^ that ' bcforG incurring this we would naturally ion to secure our position for some time ahead. It would only be reasonable to offer some increased rate of payment as tne present figure is not very high. , . agreement has been extended we can then go anead \/ith the ancill.ory services : ' v/hich xri.ll naturally include bulk storage. I thinlc however it would be a mistake to show our intentions in the matter of the bulk storage until 0 ?vTt- SeCUred th ! extens i° n of the Civil Air Agreement. The ^ ^reement as extended by the Shaikh is subsequent % ? ine Shaikh s concession in Vv-hich he gave 3.A.P.C.O. the“sole rigut to erect tankage and so must be held to override it.

Geoffrey Prior. 20/9/45.1 Sheikh in connection with the Air Agreement. A. As regards the last paragraph of Sir Geoffrey PrArs note, we have recently seen the report (forwarded v.lth your letter R. 7302/A5/C. 0.1. of 12th September) on a recent tour of the Middle East and Africa by a joint Mission of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and B.O.A.C. in which there is suggested as a possibility the abandonment of Muharraq Aerodrome in favour of a new aerodrome near Hamala on the main Bahrein Island. The Civil Air Agreement, as Sir Geoffrey Prior points out, would cover such a new aerodrome since it refers to ”aerodromes' in the plural. There has doubt less not yet been time for you to consider the full implications of this suggestion but it would of course be helpful if we could know as soon as possible the future intentions of the Air Ministry and Ministry of Civil Aviation as regards Bahrein. 5 . I should be grateful to have your comments at an early date. If you agree that this is desirable we will arrange a meeting of those concerned to discuss the matter here in the near future. 6 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Rarapton at the Air Ministry, who may perhaps wish to attend any meeting that may be arranged, to Cheetham at the Foreign Office, and also to Stock of the Ministry of Fuel and Power.

Moreover, the war time ruling whereby local requirements of aviation fuel in Bahrein should be met from the Bahrein Reiineiy in accordance with the 'short h^.ul'. principle no longer applied* Other things being equal it would be in accordance with present policy to meet these requirements from the nearest sterling source (i.e* Abadan) if this were pr*p 11 o hhl e « ^ : G-ass stated that Anglo--Irani an were most anxious to be in a position to sapply aviation fuel to B.O.A.C. at Bahrein in order to avoid a break in their Cj.o.j n oi supply points on the air route to the East, and that they foresaw no difficulty in supplying fuel both to the R.A.F. and to the B.O.A.C. at Bahrein on a competitive basis, provided that they were not precluded from erecting the necessary tankage by i.A.P.f.0’s claim to a monopoly* It was agreed that bulk rduelling facilities were the oifly practicable method of handling future requirements, and Anglo-Iranian*s earlier suggestion of shipping supplies in drums from Abadan would not provide a sat inf notary alternative* Wing Commander Fuller stated that the Air Ministry’s current estimate of R.A.F. requirements of .100/130 Grade fuel in Bahrein was 6,730 barrels a month, and that total British requirements could now be estimated at about 8,000 barrels a month as against previous estimates of about 15 , 000 . 4-. Mr. Gordon thought that even at this rate it might be necessary to provide bulk storage in addition to the existing 700 ton tank on Muharraq. 5* Sir G-eoi 1 rey^Pryor suggested that in order to forestall any objection on the part of the Bahrain G-ove^nirien^-it mi^h£ be necessary to adjust the customs duty to bo paid by fuel ef^badhn origin so as to bring it into line with the royalties payable on Bahrein production. Mr® G-ass considered that this would not prevent Anglo-Iranifrom offerir^ fu^l at a competitive price. Air Commodore Collier while recognising the advantage of drawing fuel from a sterling source was anxious that this should not involve uneconomic expenditure on 1 r eight, equipment etc., or a law suit with B.A.P.C.O. as to the validity of their tankage monopoly. 7© Mr. Gass comirmed that Anglo—Iranian would be willing to meet the extra expenditure involved including, if necessary the erection of a new storage tank or tanks within the perimeter of Mbharraq airfield and on that portion of the arGa already purchased by the R.A.F. They ■would also be prepared to defray the cost of ary new pipelines and shore offloading facilities if these became necessary. On the monopoly, question Mr. Gass emphasised that B.A.P.C.0. were hot faced with any corresponding obstacle’in offering supplies in Iran or 8 * Mr. Stock pointed out that it would not be easy for Anglo-Iranian to negotiate an exchange arrangement with B.A.P.C.0. that did not involve dollar payment for Bahrein production either directly or indirectly, since B.A.P.C.0., U-n-»or the terms of their C.o.e. contract, already orv dollar outlet for their whole output.

As a first step the Air Ministry, provided they were assured of supplies to meet their immediate needs, would inform B.A.P.C.O. that they did not purchase any further supplies of Bahrein aviation fuel, and that th^ wo^^^ee local requirements from Ahadan under their existing contract with 1 !?aht Tf* B \ PC 0 raised any objection on the score of their tankage monopoly it might Z mcussaxy'toirect^'tank.agc on the m*arra q airfield in pl-e of the e^ing tank which would bo done at the expense of .agio-Iranian. formallv notify Ar^lo-Iranian of their requirements as early as possible in ra that toe latter to^ht go ahead vdth their supply arrangements which would involve the acquisition of a coasting tanker. 12.

In case a meeting is called on this subject while I am away it may be worth while ray letting you have a note on it. The trouble has arisen because the Bahrein Bstroleum Company clairn^under Article ^^of their concession which gives them ’’the exclusive right to contract and operate the^ineries and storage tanks within the Sheik’s Dominions', that nobody except themselves has the right to erect and operate petrol tanks for the refuelling of aircraft on the aerodromes. The legal question is a complicated one and we are not disposed to admit Bahrein Petroleum Company ’ s claim though we have wished to avoid a dispute with them on the subject. The question is discussed at length in the note flagged at 'X* and paragraph 3 of it represents the Legal Adviser’s views. You will see from their letter 28th August that Petroleum Division have now suggested that the time has come when we should face the issue with the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Prom the India Office point of view it is desirable in peace no less than in war that we should avoid unpleasantness with the Bahrein Petroleum Company where possible, but if the other departments consider we must have a showdown we cannot press our point too far. The Political Resident has advocated that, if the legal position must be argued with the Bahrein Petroleum Company, it should be done in London and not in Bahrein. At the earlier stage when it was contemplated that a communication should be made to the Bahrein Petroleum Company merely reserving our rights on the position, we agreed with the view of the Air Ministry that it would be better for the coninunication to be made in Bahrein in the first instance in order to avoid if possible a legal dispute developing. If, however, it is now suggested that we should have a showdown with the Bahrein Petroleum Company on the matter I think that the communication should be made in London* (presumably by the Air Ministry^ to the Bahrein Petroleum Ccmpary in the first instance. / . , ^ ■ ^ Ptwkv~-SECRET EXPRESS LETTER From:- Secretary of State for India.

I am to refer also to Air Ministry Signal OX. 6733 dated 14th December, in which you were asked to suspend action on the proposed contract for the present, for the reasons given in the Signal. 2. A general Conference on this question was held at the Air Ministry on the 30th October last, attended by representatives of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, the India Office and Officers of the Air Ministry. A Note of the Meeting is attached for your information. This will put you in possession of the general policy of the Air Ministry at that time, subject to such modification as later developments mJL ht require. lou will appreciate the highly confidential nature of this Mote. 3. As you are aware, the Bahrein Petroleum Company consider that their legal position as the sole Company entitled to maintain and operate the tankage in Bahrein, ia unassailable, and it is understood that they vould be prepared, if neoeasaiy, to take legal proceedings with a view to restraining the Anglo-lranian Oil from infringing what they believe to be their monopoly. 1 nn to observe in this connection that the Air Ministry does not admit the benrein retroieum Company*s contention in respect at' the two stations at kanaiar and AUharraq, for the reasons summarised in paragraph 3 of the Rote of the idsetiqg. It would however be undesirable, on the grounds set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Note of the Meeting, for the Air Ministry to become involved in any court proceedings on this issue at the present time. 4. As a result of further discussions held between those present at the meeting on the 3oth October, a letter was sent to the Anglo-lranian Oil Company, uondon, s copy of which is al&amp;o enclosed for your information. The Company replied to this letter on 12th Ceoember, acknowledging the Air Ministry's proposals but expressir%; some concern over the continuing * security of tenancy of shore tankage*. (This concern is met by the fact that these tanks are Air Ministry property and that we reserve the right with either Company to continue the proposed arrangements or to modify them in the light of experience&gt;. The Company goes on to raise the question of the future source of oil. Thus will be dealt with separately. % It remains to intimate the Air Ministry's scheme to the Bahrein Corapaxy locally. This will require very careful phrasing, in collaboration with the Political Resident, sad it ia requested that you should signal the outline of what it ia proposed to say. This would cover the Mudiarraq tanks in the first instance, end it is perhaps politic to deal with this first and separately. The same question for Manama can be taken up later, in the light of the developments which may ensue from the proposals in the following paragraph.

Bahjrein Petroleiga Installatioos Dear R&amp;&amp;$&gt;ton, Thank you for your letter Ho* CS• 22257/59(0) of the l6th May, oh the above subject. I think that the Political Resident*a point is that it is undesirable for tlie Political Agent and the local E*A«P» authorities to become involved in a dispute with the Bahrein Petroleum Co. at Bahrein on the legal issues involved in this question. If such a dispute does arise out of the coeounication which it is proposed should be made to the Bahrein Petroleum Cocpany by the A.O.C. , it seems to me that this should be conducted in London. But I think we had hoped that such a dispute rai^V be avoided, and all that was contemplated was that the A. O.C, should in making hi. consounicatlon to the Company make it dear tltfit H.M.G. cannot admit ^ that the Coapea^r's claim to an exduaivp right to erect and operate oil tanks covers storage wiiich forms part of the aerodrome installations or services. We would not, therefore, &gt;dsh at ttiis stage to raise any objection to the issue of the letter which has been drafted to the A.O.C. Iraq in Persia if you wish to proceed with this. Paragraph 6 of the draft willi however, now require some alteration, since (a) the Govemiient of Bahrein’s agreeraent to the definition of aerodrome in Indian Aircraft Rules, 1920, has now been secured, and (b) the demarcation of the aerodrome/ L.

Raspton, Esq., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kirigsway, W.C.2.aerodrome area to include space for the proposed oil installation has been held up, as explained in the Political Resident *s telegram 527* until the site for the storage tanks cah be determined* I note, however, from the signal No. 0243 of Mey 12th fron H.Q., R.A.F* Middle liJast, that BAPCO have since been invited to install the tankage at Manaiaa, ; but since their estimate is considered excessive aray channels are being explored, and also that the suggestion of using a dumb barge* lias been revived. It looks, therefore, as though the situation may undergo another change. • *0 &gt; - * -• *•* -• ■ v - ...... .. , * • ■ ^ ' I am sending a copy of this letter to Stock, ♦ « Tours sincereiy, * * V W P.

I think that undue significance has perhaps been attached to the suggestion in the Political Resident's signal that the announcement to the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be mane in London. The emphasis in that signal, is I feel, intended merely to be on the need of an early intimation to the Company of our intentions in general, so that the site for the storage tanks at Manama can be determined, and the delineation of the airfields can be completed* At the conference which you attended on the 30th Octooer, 1944 it was agreed for reasons of a political complexion that the notification to the Company should in the first place be mao.e to them in Bahrein and not in London, and as in his signal tne Political Resident has advanced no reasons for reversing this decision we cannot see any cause for doing so. Unless therefore you have in the meantime received cogent reasons to the contrary we propose as originally planned, to instruct the A.O.C. Iraq and Persia in consultation with the Political Residenij to make the agreed communication to the Company in Bahrein. I am sending a copy of this letter to ^tock at the Ministry of Fuel and Power and before despatching the letter to the A.O.C. will await your views.A.M.

ROUGH DRidFT ONLY SECRET Pcbruo-ry, 1945* Sir, t BAHREIN PETROLEU1/I INSTALL:\TIONS I am directed to refer to your Signal Q.620 dated 5th October , in which you sought Air Ministry sanction to enter into a formal contract with the Bahrein Petroleum Company in connection with refuelling arrangements for aircraft in Bahrein, I am to refer also to Air Ministry Signal OX.6733 dated 14th December, in which you were asked to suspend action on the proposed contract for the present, for the reasons given in the Signal, 2, A general Conference on this question had been held at the Air Ministry' on the 30'th October, attended by representatives of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, the India Office and Officers of the Air Ministry, A Note of the Meeting is attached for your information. You will appreciate the highly confidential na.turc of this Note. 3. As you are aware, the Bahrein Petroleum Company consider that' their legal position as the sole Company entitled to maintain and operate the tankage in Bahrein, is unassailable, and it is understood that they would be prepared, if necessary, to take legal proceedings with a view to restraining the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from infringing what they believe to be their monopoly. I am to observe in this connection that the Air Ministry does not admit the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s contention in respect of the two stations at Manama and Muharraq, for the reasons summarised in paragraph 3 of the Note of the Meeting. It would however be undesirable, on the grounds set out in paragraphs A and 5 °f the Note of the Meeting, for the .air Ministry to become involved in any Court proceedings on this issue. A. As a result- of further discussions held between those present at the meeting on the 30th October, a letter was sent to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Compajagr^London, a copy of which is also enclosed for your information. The Company r epli ed to this letter on 12th December, acknowledging the Air istfy’s -proposals but expressing some concern over the continuing 'security of tenancy of shore tankage'. (This concern is met by the fact that these tanks are Air Ministry property.and that we reserve the right with either Company to continue the proposed arrangements or to modify them in the light of experience). The Company goes on to raise the larger question of the /future•r future source of supply of oil. This is not pursued in the present letter to you and the general question of the future supply of oil will be dealt with separately on its own merits. 5* It remains to intimate the Air Ministry's scheme to the Bahrein Company locally. This will require very careful phrasing, in collaboration with theJPolitical Resident, and it is requested that you should signal the outline of what it is proposed to say. This would cover the Muharraq tanks in the first instance, and it is perhaps politic to deal with this first and separately. The same question for Manama can be taken up later, in the light of the developments which may ensue from the proposals in the foll&lt;*wing paragraph. 6 . As regards Manama, you have had the further Air Ministry telegram OX.9477 of 13th February. It is being arranged that the Political Resident will, I ^ ^ ! t-4 in consultation with yourself, take up two matters with the Sheikh*. J * r (a) the application of the fc-overnment of India's; definition of ^'Eea 1 : aerodrome' 1“ v; :f4o.&gt;W 14 7* &lt;+ J ^ ^ J v •A* © V - U ^T / which would v\ 14 2*^**^ Vi automatical!^ include eos l&amp;ndy/for ite off ioes- and/ ^ »/Kr»v f f t fv { installatA^ns} and hu Ka A^vCTl) vTVn^. ^ ty*-OL (b) jth.Q request for additional land)for the proposed oil installation on shore. Assuming that this goes through, the intention then is that the tanks would bo Air Ministry property, that they would be installed by the Bahrein Company as our agents, and that they v/ould be operated and maintained by the same Company. The Anglo-Iranian Company would carry out the physical refuelling in detail as at Muharraq. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, Tho Air Officer Commanding, Air Headquarters, IRAK &amp; PERSIA.

As regards any payments that may be considered due to Bahrein /Government2 . Government arising from definition of area of air-base, Air Ministry would not wish comparatively insignificant financial considerations involved to impede agreement but point out that payments to Sheikh arising from civil air operations have risen from £650 in first year of agreement to £1600 in last completed year and- are likely to^siso higher. 5, Air Ministry are sending parallel instructions to local R.A.F, authorities.

Apart from what is said in this enclosure, I would that, on the basis of the Air Ministry drafting, your paragraph 3 might be altered to read as follows 'It is now proposed that bulk storage tanks for maintaining aviation fuel supplies to aircraft should be installed at Manama.

Paragraph 3 of your draft cable indicates that the contract for erection and operation of the tanks 'will probably be given to BAPCO'. The draft cable on this subject to the olitioal Resident in the Persian Gulf which Harrison has circulated with his letter of the ^7th January is more categoric than this and he will, I understand, agree a common wording with you* Again in paragraph 3 of your draft cable, I suggest that the penultimate sentence dealing with the contract going to BAi-CX) should be lengthened by the addition of words to the following effect : 'In which case BAPCO will, at the same time, be informed that do not admit that their claim to exclusive right to erect and operate tanks covers storage which forms part of aerodron® installations or services'.

O ■ does not recomlse that BAiCO«a rights in respect of stesrage installations on Bahrein are exclusive in the sense that they extend to storage installations which are reoaired as part and parcel of the operation of flying stations. 1 For reasons of policy, however, it is not considered expedient t&lt;$ brix^ this in^ue to a head In wartime and it Is therefore intended that iiAKX, who bfrvo, of course, been very helpful in the past, should continue to operate the bulk stomge at £ 8 uharraq and should also operate the bulk storage at Itexwm, while the Anglo-Iranian will do the actual aircraft fuelling at both places. ' - X J j » * r » The A*l*C*c* accept this situation in tholr letter of 12 th 1 — ember, but go on to point out that bulk starv e is now an essential feature of any modem refuelling system and that a / without- 2 - without it A # I«0*C • will b© unable ©fficiontly to maintain ry its refbellint serrice in Bahrein. Consequently, if BAPCO alloved to exercise sole rights to eraet and operate storace they lwf«, in faot, the means to shut out unless K*&amp; # G # proride storage for their use* They therefore draw attention to the fhot that, while for reasons of tanker econcmy, they cannot expect to make bulk* supplies available in Bahrein ex Abadan in mrtiiae, after the war they m y be able to do so on a canpetitive basis with cu^plio© fraa the BMCC refinery* To put them in a position to ccmpete, howerer, they will need soourlty of tenure of bulk storage in Bahrein, Fe fully agree with this point, but, as you say, the A*I,Q,C'a prospects will be safeguarded by the fact that H,K*C. reserves its rights vis-a-vis KlCO's claims in regard to the operation of the storage you will have at flying stations on Bahrein, ?« feel that it is important to make it clear to BAJPGO that the Air Ministry considers itself quite free to transfer the storage agency frcm B/1C0 to Anglo-Iraniar, and to moke any other adjustments it sees fit in the agency arrangements now contempluted, Fran our point of view, we should like to see the a. 1,0,0. in charge of the shore tankage at imnam as they suggest at the end of their letter, but in view of the other factors to be taken into account, we should not wish to press thi ^point until your negotiations with the Sheikh are completed rnd, in any case, 1 understand the point may arise through the A*I*0,C* being in a position to provide this additions 1 tankage themselves and more quickly than could otherwise be arranged. Generally speaking, we would like you to bear in mind the desirability of putting the A. 1*0*0* in a position to maintain supplies to Bahrein, particularly if, in post-war conditions, they are able to supply competitively with BAPCC, Finally, I would suggest that in your reply to the Company, they should be encouraged to como to a working arrangement with BAiC 0 which would be mutually satisfactory to the companies. / X mt k I am sending a copy of this to at the India Of flea and enclose an extra copy to you in caa© you find it useful* « Tours sincerely* '-',r otocjc. f ir James hobs* Air Mnistry# thltetedtX; S.l*l,SECRET 945 /£ENDA FOR A MEETING- TO BE HELD iff /JR MINISTRY, IN W^h2.6 \' S,E&gt; 'wTO iJ 11QQ HOURS ON THURSDAY, 25TH J/JIUjiRY, 19A5 This meeting has been called to discuss the aviation fuel installations at Bahrein and to consider the provision of further facilities in the form of tankage and pipeline, 2, D.D,E,10 has recommended the installation of bulk tankage at Manama (flying boat base) and it is also for consideration as to 'hether such tankage, if provided, should be linked with the proposed main pipeline from Sitra (main installation) to Muharraq.

It w as not clear as to- whether any rental would be charged* C. 0. 1 .. then went on to say that the definition of a 'Sea aerodrome', as known in India, should be agreed as applicable to MUUIAkA. The Political Resident was being asked to confer with H. ,R. i^F. , Middle East as to the physical limits of the boundaries of the area. If these boundaries can be defined and INDIA OIF ICE agreement reached with the Bahrein Government, then there would be no difficulty in erecting the 2 tanks adjacent to the jetty.

IT ./ixo that, subject to negotiations, the contract would probably have to be placed with the Bahrein D.D.Q, 2. Company and that this would be done by H. Q. ,R. P. , Middle Bast, through Q. , Iraq and Persia, It was important that the contract should be worded as not to imply acceptance by the judr ministry of the Company's claim £hat any such work should be undertaken by than p.s of right. 9* as the Bahrein Petroleum Company i s now^ production ntage. IT liCRuLlD that it would be necessary ‘ to call upon them to operate and maintain the tankage as agents of the R. .u.F. The actual refuelling of flying boats would be undertaken by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company as hitherto, also acting as our agents. 10. IT laUS AGRDiD that if a main pipeline is laid from SITRA to MUHuRRAQ, the proposed tankage at MANAMA should be linked up by branch pipeline as this would involve little extra work and material. 11 . It was stated that a scheme had previously been formulated for the laying of a pipeline from SITRA to MUHARRAQ but that this had been temporarily abandoned some months ago owing to non-availability of material and labour. S/Ldr, Bannister, H.Q., R. A.F. , Middle Bast, stated that proposals were again under consideration in Iraq and Persia uND IT Wii that H. Q* * R. m. F. , Middle Bast should be asked D.D. 0. 2 . to submit a scheme with details'of plans and availability of materials and labour. 12. In view of the fact that the tankage would probably be installed, operated and maintained by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, it appeared logical that the laying of the pipeline should also be carried out by this Company. This, hov/ever, would be for decision at a later date when plans were more clearly defined, , ' ' 13 . IT iiGRBBD that when the time arrived the question of surveying the land and siting the tanks should be left to the Chief Engineer, A,H.Q. , Iraq and Persia, in consultation with the Contractors. 14# During the course Ttf' the~meeting, Mr, Walsh (F. 5 .(b)) ^ raised the question as to v/hether the land at MANAMA was or would be R.x^F. property as this would have a bearing on the ^ rights and claims of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in connection with the proposed tankage.

We have already developed refuelling facilities at Bahrein for present and post-war air traffic at considerable cost, out we shall have at best a precarious hold and shall be unable to enter into supply contracts unless we are given security of tenancy of shore tankage. If, further, the Air Council were able to reconsider the allocation of duties at lanama and utilise the services of A. I. 0. C. to operate and maintain the shore tankage there when erected as well as to refuel the aircraft, it would in our view greatly facilitate the refuelling operations as a whole at the two points where A, I. 0.

R. E, Latham), India Office (ifc, Harrison), iiL,Q,2 (Group Captain Tuille), IXHE. 10 (v&amp;ng Ooisaander Aberdein and Squadron Leader Marshall), ihjor Jones, representing D.GXC.A., and Sir Jajues Boss* Bie present position is that at Miharraq a contract has been placed locally with the Bahrein Petroleum Conpany for the maintenance and operation of the airfield tanks, while the Anglo—Iranian Company continue as hitherto to canty out the refuelling of aircraft in detail between the tanks and the landing ground* It had been proposed to give notice to close the B.A*P.CX(X contract and give all the local agency work (tanks and refuelling) to A. !• (X CX B. A, • C# C. » hearing of this, have let it be known that they may contest the matter in the Agency Courts, for an injunction to restrain A. I. (X C. from infringing their monopoly of operating tankage at Bahrain. ttiis meeting was therefore called to consider how to deal with the situation. 2. Bie case of Miharraq. was dealt with first. A somewhat dindlar problem for Ibnama was next considered, and a common policy covering both was defined. / ttie legal question arises over the extent and practical effect of 'the exclusive right to construct and operate refineries and storage tanks within the Sheikh's do^ILnionB•, granted to B.A.P.&lt;X&lt;X under their AgreeiiEnt % ('Deed of Modification') with the Sheikh dated 19th June, 19X0, having regard to - (a) the previous Civil Air Agreement between H. IX (X and the Sheikh dated 6th June, 1934, in which H,14(X had already received exclusive rights generally 'to establish and maintain .... an aerodrome, or aerodromes, and ancillary services in the Sheikh's territory,' including 'the sole right to supply either directly or through their Agents, fuel and lubricants to users of the Aerodromes ... ', and (b) the siibsequent Political Agreement between IX M G. and B.A,P.(XQ. dated 29th June, 19X£, in which the Conpany agreed (inter alia) that notwithstanding anything in its prior Agreements with the , /SheikhShaikh it would not have the right to use or occupy, and would not include in the areas selected for its operations, aixy sites which raey have been selected by H. 14 G* for defence purposes for aerodromes, aeroplane or sea-plane bases, tiider the Civil Air Agreement above-mentioned we might reasonably claim that we are at liberty to construct at the airfield any oil or other installation necessary fcr operating that airfield. Oil tankage for detail issue is as nuch an organic part of the airfield as the signalling plant or any other similar apparatus or office. Further, we could contend that the grant to B, A. 1. C. 0. relates solely to the storage tanks necessitated by the refineries and required for bulk storage and issue. Note. — This Civil Air Agreement relates not only to Lfcutiama, but also to Miharraq. Both airfields are specifically mentioned in the Air Navigation Regulations attached to the Agreement. 4* In ordinary course we would have no hesitation in taking the above line with B. A. P. 0. 0. There are, however, two policy considerations which qualify this:- (a) B.A.P. G.0. have been very helpful to the B. A.F. and local relations have hitherto been very good. It is important that these good relations shall continue, it being borne in mind that this Company have the entire rights of exploitation oi oil in Bahrein and will before long be the sole supplier of petrol in bulk to these two stations. (b) If the matter goes to the Courts it will certainly be mis represented in America that we have deliberately chosen A. I. 0. C. as our Agents and cancelled the contract with H A. P. C. G« because the latter is virtually an American conpaqy. vfc cannot afford at the present time to have a dispute of this kind over a matter which is really of secondaiy inportance. Biis American Con^ary is firmly established, so that there is no large comnercial interest at stake. It really comes to a matter of saving face for the Anglo-Iranian, and it is thought that this can be done by allowing them to continue to do the agency work of re-fuelling aircraft in detail. /5. A5* A further point of policy is that we want to buy additional land for the airfield at Muharraq, for which we mst have the Sheikh’s goodwill. Similarly at l&amp;ntijna land will have to be bought or leased for the shore tank installations now conteupdated. These things will be easier if there is no controversy, involving the Sheikh himself, over the tankage question. In the oase of Ifanama, the service hitherto has been provided on rough and ready lines, by tins stacked on shore and cap tied into fuel launches for the flying boats. This service has been provided for by A.I*(XC. for SLdiUC. and R.A.P. As a temporaxy expedient A. X. 0« G. have recently met the bulk storage difficulty by using a dunfo barge moored by the Jetty. This, however, is an inefficicrt arcangeroent and also presents a serious fire hazard. !Bie proper course is uo construct a tank installation ashore. This installation would be part of the shore buildings of the airport. IfB.0. A.C. (or A. I. 0. C. as their agents) were given a free hand to provide the tankage and manage it, there is little doubt that this would raise the same controversy as at Miharraq. Further, the controversy would con* back upon H. H G* , seeing that B, 0. A. C, are only there by authority from us under our Civil Air Agreement with the Sheikh. The tanks at Muharraq are B.A.F. property and were constructed under our supervision and for the same way the tankage at Manama should be provided by us and managed as our property. Bie only question is over the agency which we should choose. general policy which we reached at the conference was as follows:~ (1) Miharraq - We should instruct the A. 0.0. Iraq and Persia to inform B. A. ?. C, 0. f s local representative that the agency woik had been reviewed as a whole. It was understood that the Conpany claimed monopoly rights in the matter and might even go to law over it. The &amp; A. F. authorities were fully within their rights in providing and operating storage tanks, which were a necessary part of the working of the airport. Biey were, however, anxious to reach a friendly settlement of the matter, without any prejudice to thair lesal rights now or in the future. They had therefore /arranged7 aivanged thfit the contract a3.ready made with B. w P. C« 0. for the maintenanoe and operating of the tanks should be continue * for the present, while the corresponding arrangement with the Anglo-Irani an Conpany for the fuelling of the aircraft should similarly be maintained* TMs would be intimated to B. A. P. C. 0, at Bahrein to prevent the matter becoming one for London and Washington, but it would be intimated to the Anglo-Iranian Gompaiy in London* (2) ifcnama - Here we should follow mnh the same plan, though the detailed application will come later. Bie first point is to arrange for the purchase or lease of the additional land, intimating to the Sheikh the purpose for which it is required. !Biis would presumably be done through the Political Agent. Plan - This would then be as followss- aiiG. would own the installations in all cases; B.A.P.C.G. would be invited as agents to construct and operate the tanks, while A. I. 0. C. would be authorised to carry out the detailed refuelling of all aircraft. 7. In amplification of ( 3 ) above - the A. LaU have stated that th v can provide the tanks required at Itaama. * should therefore reserve the right to use their services if it turns out that B.A.P.c.0. have no tank. available or that A. L a C. are better placed to carry through the eerie required. 8. It will also be necessary to define more explicitly just what the two terms 'maintaining and operating tanks’ and ’refuelling’ OT an as technical terms in relation to each other*V ; l [ Received under B?dirain ifindoraeraent No* G/1461 dated 12th October. 1944.)

This berth forms part of certain additional facilities we are providing at the Marine Base, Manamah, to enable us to handle increased quantities of aviation fuel, which, we anticipate, will be required by B.O.a.C. and Refers Flying-boats in the near future. . To facilitate the loading of the refuelling launches we are arranging also to make available shortly at Manama a bulk barge of approximately 70,000 gallon capacity. This barge will normally lie at a deep water anchorage to the south of the jetty to be decided in consultation with Messrs.

It would appear from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company 1 s letter of the 18th August that they contemplate a bulk barge refuelling system will la from the Air ^nistry^ letter No. S. 102284 of the 7th of August they should be contemplating a shore tank refuelling system. The position is further complicated by the action of the 3.O.A.C. in doubling the width oi the h.A.F. pier and vastly extending the sea end on which thev have erected a house without any reference either directly to this Agency or through the Air Ministry whose agents they consider themselves to be. When a shelter was erected in 1937 adjacent to the H.A.F. pier for the B.OA.C. refreshment room it was held that the Bahrain Governments permission was required and they were liable to pay an annual rental. In fhis connection please see Bushire Express Letter No. 868-5 of the 20th pec ember--1922^ ' — — o. Presumably the local R.A.F. authorities when \ &gt; approached by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Copaany, as suggested in my (V demi-official- .letter No, 0/1285 of the 4th Je itcmhcr, will coir-municate with the Air .Ministry and after receiving instructions will take the matter up with this Agency. I hope that this v/ill result in it being finally decided what system of bulk supoiy the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will instal. It would certainly be of advantage if the question of the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ contention that they alone are entitled to erect ond operate storage tanks could be decided before the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company commence installing a refuelling system. In the meantime I will discuss the question of the pier extension with Belgrave immediately on his return. Yours sincerely. T. Hickinbotham.

T 4 67 2 944 ftSth October, 1 May I refer to Iraq and Persia telegram to Air Ministry No.Q* 620 of ^October 5th. I liave heard of no reactions to this telegram which seems to indicate that BAPGO are, in fact, operating as supply agents for aviation spirit on behalf of R.A.P., in spite of the agreement that this work should be attended to by A.I.O.G. I understand from A.I.O.G. that they have postponed incurring expenditure on distributing equipment on the island and have, for the time being, limited themselves to installing a bulk barge which could, of course, be removed. This is perhaps all to the good, but A.I.O.C. are in the dark as to what is going on. We have recently suggested to their Ghairaian that the knot should be cut by direct negotiations between A.I.O.C. and Galtex, but I do think that as a preliminary step we should hold a meeting with Air Ministry and Foreign Office, and, if possioie, wich a representative of A.I.O.G. to bring matters to a head.

You are aware of the position which has arisen at Bahrein in connection with the proposal that the Anglo “Irani an Oil Ccnipany should, erect shore fuel storage tanks at Manama to enable them adequately to cany out, as agents of B«0»A*C*, their responsibilities for refuelling R*A»P# and B*0*A»C* flying boats. We are satisfied that the present temporary expedient of using a dumb barge is unsatisfactory. The present barge is 25/30 years old and was designed to carry non-dangerous oil products only. The type of construction is unsuitable for highly inflammable fuels, and particularly so in an open sea anchorage. The barge has to be moored within a reasonable distance of the flying boat ali^iting area and in this position it presents a serious fire hazard in view of the numerous native craft operating in that area. necessitate frequent docking, and unfortunately the priority in other directions do not permit a replacement barge being made available. provision of shore tanks as early as possible. Tankage for 50,000 gallons is required. operation by A.I.O.C. of shore tankage at Manama on account of the doubt as to the legal position vis-a-vis the Bahrein Petroleum Company limited.

In this connection J understand, unofficially, from A.I.O.C. that . they have received a letter from Air Ministry coniimiLng that they are to continue, as Agents, for all supplies of aviation spirit. The relevant telegrams seem to me to be that from Air Ministry AX*424 of llarch 21 et to Ira , 3 . and Ibrsia and the reply of the latter dated I larch 23 rd reference 0.64. In the latter telegram A.H.Q. confirmed that they had eveiy intention of continuing the • arrangement by Uriah A.I.O.C* acted as agents. tty understanding of the general background was that R.A.P. would lease the land and instal such extra tanks as were needed, using BAPCO as agents for this work as necessary, but that once the equipment was in place, A.I.O.C. would,operate it on behalf of R.A # P # and be responsible for the supplying of the fuel into aircraft. This does not seem consistent with A.H.Q. letter dated April 10th to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in which they offer a contract with the latter covering the operation and maintenance of the tanks at lluharraq and stating that it is desired that BAK50 should be resppnsible for delivery from the * tanks into R.A.F. refuellers. / fta I »,. r 1*01 AYou vdlll remember that A # T ,0,G # , on the strength ox tlieir antioipation that they would remain agents of the R.A.F. and B.O # A.C. were proposing to incur considerable capital expenditure on facilities at Bahrein* I feel, therefore, that the next step should he that Air Ministiy sliould discuss the position in detail with so timt the latter should know jusk where, thay stand* Perhaps the next stags would be to request discuss the proposed airang scents, not only wi-h BAPuO, but also with the local A 0 1*O* people* X am sending a copy of this letter to Peel* » »Tours sincerely, (bgd) 4&gt; • bi n . ■ - / r&gt;r:rxr.;tr.'zc Sir James Ross,K*£.E.,C.B*,, .

These liiharraq tanks have nothing whatever to do with the wells and refineiu.es to which the Bahrein Company *s Agreement relate s. Actually the Bahrein Company have nothing to gain, so far as I can see, by doing this maintenance; their interests are in bulk fuel supply and that is not affected. We infer from the A. 0.

Petrol Storage and Supply - at Bahrein ; . nr-4 . / a— 12th June, 1%4. You vdll by this time have had a copy of our telegram Sec.X 314 of 10th June about the Bahrein Petrol Tanks. This is the best answer I can give to your letter of 6th June, and to Berthoud*s letter of 2nd June. I should like, however, to go over the sequence of events in outline, in view of the surprise which both Berthoud and yourself have felt over the action by idr Headquarters in asking BAPCO H to act as their agents for the maintenance of P.A.P. tank installations at Miharraq and for the delivery of aviation spirit therefrom into TL A. p. refuellers.' _ 7/e here have examined the telegrams afresh, and the notes of oui discussions, and we think that Air Headquarters have not really acted contrary to instructions. Indeed these particular points were nee dealt with in the instructions. You will remember how at first we were advised that we had no case legally and that the Bahrein- Gonpary could make good their claim to run the entire business. At that stage we did our best r to safeguard the position by the action detailed in our telegram of 13th H ardh, Sec. X. 757. In brief, the land would be leased by us and the tanks would be our property. As a matter of expediency, however, we would ask the Buhrein Gompary to instal the tanks as our agents for the works. In actual fact the B.A.F. installed the tanks themselves. I do not remember whether at that stage we discussed maintenance oi tanks and the re-fuelling of the individual aircraft. I don f t think we did. Anyhow it came to our knowledge within a few days that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Conpany were carrying out the re-fuelling of aircraft at Bahrein on behalf of the H. A. F. , using their own re fuelling vehicles and personnel. By this was meant the drawing of X R. Peel Bsq. , India Office, n JJC n K ! /gallons S. .7.1. * -V L.* gallons from the tanks and the fuelling of this into the aircraft. All that the BAPCO people would do would be to let off X gallons on demand. Te thereupon sent our further telegraiq^ of 21st lihrch, AX. 424 , instructing 3.A.3?* Headquarters to arrange, if poss hie, for A.I.O.C. to continue to act as our agents in providing re-fuelling services as hitherto. dr Headquarters telegraphed hack on 22nd Jferch, saying that this was all in order and would he continued. Lfeantime we were waiting for the legal position to he established beyond doubt. It was only after our first telegram ( 13 th luarch) had gone that we began to see that our legal position was much stronger than we had thought. This being so, we had it in mind to take advantage before long of our having safeguarded the position in respect of the lease of land and ownership of tanks and to say to the Bahrein Company that from some given date we will maintain the tanks ourselves. Probably also we would take responsibility for the bulk petrol delivered into these tanks. On receiving your letter we reviewed the local position afresh. Y/e do not know for certain that the proposals in para. 5 cf the letter of 19th Karch have been carried out, seeing that in their telegram of 1 7th March they reported that BAPCO thought we should operate and maintain the tanks ourselves. This is exactly what we want. We have, therefore, telegraphed to A. 0. C. Iraq and Persia asking him to take this up. This, is irrespective of the legal position. Why we did not do this before we just cannot reconstruct I am sending a copy of this to Berthoud.

(PETROLEUM DIVISION), Dean Stanley Street, London, S.W.l, 2ifth April, With reference to your letter to Prior of April 20th and its enclosures, I wonder whether you could very kindly let me have, for reference purposes, a copy of Hr. Beckett*s letter of April D+th which is mentioned. R. Peel, Esq,C.I.E. India Office, ^ Whitehall, ^ S. W.1.I saw Mr. G-ass,/Direct or of the .*1.0.0., on Thursday . 16th liaroh. He explained that for a nuciber of years his Company had been supplying B.0. A.C. (and its predecessor) with petrol on the air* route along the Gulf# Hitherto petrol has been brought in from Abadan in tanks and drums and has been poured straight into bov/sers on the aerodromes* ' 1 ,?ith the increase in traffic however requirements are getting too big for this method to be maintained successfully and it is essential to be able to put up storage tanks* Until the point was raised recently by the Bahrain Petroleum Comparer his Company had no knowledge of the exclusive right of A*P. Co. to construct and supply oil storage tanks in Bahrein and he wanted to find out what the position of his Company now was. Were they in effect now excluded from operating on behalf of the B. 0. A#C* in Bahrein as they have been doing hitherto? I explained to Mr* Gass that the exclusive right to erect and operate oil storage tanks had been in B. A.P. Co. *£ earlg^vagreements but had then only applied to a particular area. When in 1940 the Company obtained a further concession which gaitted*^ them the whole of the Sheikh^ territories the exclusive right as -« to storage tanks was again included and this of course had the effect of giving them exclusive right over the whole of Bahrein* Mr. Gass enquired whether they also had the exclusive right to sell oil in Bahrein and I was able to assure him that paragraph 4 (o) of the Agreement specifically excluded-any suoh right. I told Mr* Gass that as far as I could see although we had not yet had time to explore the position from its legal aspect, there was nothing in the Agreement to prevent his Company from contiiuing to operate except that they could not erect storage tanks. Under the Civil Air Agreement, Article 11, H*14G* have the right to supply petrol either direct or through their agents to users of the aerodrome, and if they chose to select A.I. 0. C* as their agents this would make the Company's position unassailable especially as there was a clause in the Political Agreement with the Bahrain Petroleum Company that said 'The Company shall not have the right to use or occupy any sites which may have been selected by H.M.G* for aerodrome or sea plane bases'. I explained to Mr. Gass that this/( 3 )/ » this was only ny personal opinion of the position and if, with a view to the future, his Company wished the whole position to he cleared up it would he .hest for him to take it up with the Petroleum Department in the first place. Leftal Adviser - ^ Tfe should he glad-to have your views on the legal point arising from this controversy. The following appear to the the relevant portions of the various Agreements (1) Article 4(h) of the Deed of Modification dated 19th June 1940 of the 1934 Lease between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Bahrain Petroleum Company - 'The Sheikh hereby grants to the Company on behalf of himself and his successors for the same period the exclusive right to construct and operate refineries and storage tanks in the Sheikh*s present and future dominions,•,••••' ^ (2) Article 7 of the Political Agreement between H.M.G* and the Bahrain Petroleum Conpary regarding their oil concession - 'Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy and shall not include in the areas selected for the purpose of its operations ary such sites which may have been selected by or on behalf of the Sheikh or for defence purposes for aerodromes, aeroplane or sea plane bases...,,,'.(3) Article 11 of the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement - 'H.M.G* shall have the sole right to supply either directly or through their agents fuel and lubricants to users of the aerodrome'. The Bahrein Civil Air Agreement is actually op earlier date than the Oil Leaseitl934* The use of the aerodrome by British Military aircraft is covered by the Exchange of Letters appended to the Civil Air Agreement. The points which we need to get clear seem particularly to be the relation of the Civil Air Agreement to the Oil Concession Agreement and the extent to which we could use the Political Agreement to bring pressure to bear on the Bahrain Petroleum Company. It would seem absurd for instance that if H.M.G. wished to employ the A.I.O.C., which is a British Company, as their agents for the supply of petrol to aircraft using/tu Bahrein air base they should be unable to do so siuply because the Bahrain Petroleum Conpany have the exclusive right to erect and operate oil storage tanks. There can be no doubt whatever that this right was intended to be related solely to their operations as an oil producing concern, and it never entered anyone's head that it could be used as giving the Conpany any rights in regard to ‘the supplying of aerodromes. It seems to me that there is much to be said for the line which I understand is taken by the Air Ministry that in wartime at any rate the use of an aerodrome which has been granted to the R.A.P. by the Sheikh would include all the necessary facilities, and ihat we should refuse to have R.A.P. operational needs hacpered by some right of the Oil Conpany in regaird to storage tanks. I do not imagine that the Bahrein Petroleum Conpany, who are always co-operative, would in fact dispute this attitude in wartime, but I feel some doubt whether from the strict legal aspect it would be possible to maintain it in the last resort. The matter is by no means free from doubt, but I would be inclined to regard the position as follows. I think in the first// «c first place that, inasmuch as full effect could presumably be given to the sole right granted to His Majesty's Government under their agreement with the Sheikh dated 6 th June 1934, to supply fuel to users of the aerodromes established thereunder, without the actual erection or operation of storage tanks, it could not fairly be suggested that there was anything to prevent the Sheikh subsequently grantees to the Bahrain Petroleum Company the exclusive right to erict and operate such tanks. When, however, the Coup any later agreed with His Majesty's Government under the Political Agreement of the 29th June, that nothing in their previous agreement with the Sheikh should give them the right 'to use or occupy' or 'include in t&amp;e areas selected for the purpose of their operations' any sites selected by His-Majesty's Government for defence purposes for aerodromes, they in faot ^ limited the area within which inter alia their exclusive right to erect and operate storage tanks could be exercised. such reliance as might be placed on their expressed desire (recited in the Political Agreement) to submit to the influence of His Majesty's Government within the 'Sheikh's territories - I do not think it could properly be contended that they would nevertheless be entitled to prevent others from erecting and operating storage tanks on the sites in question**'.

[ 944 j 14th April 1944. ^ear Peel, You wrote to me on the 50th March encl osing some telegrams and minutes about the dispute which had arisen on the question v/hether the Bahrein Petroleum Company's exclusive right to erect storage tanks meant that no-one else had the right to erect storage tanks for re-fuelling aircraft on the aerodrome at Bahrein. It has taken me some time to get all the relevant papers and, having read them (including the letter to you of 5th April from the Air Ministry) I am amongst those who think that the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s exclusive right does not extend to the aerodrome, i.e. I take generally the same view as Kemp and as Ross in his letter to you. Possibly I might be inclined to lay more emphasis on some parts of that argument than others, but as I reach the same conclusion I do not think you will want further reasoned argument from me.

There are of course these two parts of the question, the right to supply f uel and the right to erect and operate storage tanks. There is no doubt about the first, and the legal question arises over the second. I have consulted those concerned here, and we have the following comments to . offer* Vie think we are in a strong position on both fuel and tanks, now that we have the full text of the relevant paragraphs in the various Agreements, with one dissentient (para* 8 below). . II-..'? :: i ■ . y 3* ^ Starting from the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement, which is pre-1934, it is only common sense that our exclusive, ri^it under Article 11 to supply fuel to users of the aerodrome should carry with it the provision of the means on the aerodrome for this purpose* While this would only require 4D-gallon barrels and bowsers for relatively limited use, it would certainly require a tank installation on an increasing scale as the use of the aerodrome grows. 4* The next stage is the 1934 lease between the Sheikh and the Conpany, with the Deed of- Modification dated 19th June, 1940. It would surely be upheld by any arbitrator that this grant did not affect the earlier Bahrein Civil Air Agreement; if this had been interred it should and would have- been so stated. The Conpany had sinply been given n the exclusive light to construct and operate refineries and storage tanks w , and it seems clear to us that the tanks referred to are the tanks for the refineries, and in any case could not be construed in any circumstances as referring to petrol tanks on our aerodrome; so that we are under no sort of obligation to go to them to instal our tanks for purposes of civil flying. f A A A, 5. Finally, the Political Agreement between H. M G* and the Bahrein Company, dated 2^th June, 1940, makes it dear that the Conpany have no concern at all within ary site selected by us as an air base M for defence purposes'. One would have preferred the expression to be 'for defence or civil flying purposes', but we can properly take the view that this agreement was to cover ary additional sites needed for defence without affecting the existing position for the aerodrome already in use, for both civil and defence purposes* ( ‘ light we make one comment on (|^i Kenp f s reply,where he appears to suggest that the sole right granted to H. M G. to supply fuel to users of the aerodromes established thereunder was a right to supply it without the actual erection or operation of storage tanks. Our view (as already stated) is that, although no specific reference to storage tanks is made, permission to ’ quite certainly connotes the right to make installations on the — aerodromes for the purpose. The creation of such installations is of universal at all aerodromes of any inportance* R. Peel, Esq., C.I.E., India Office, S. W.i. BE*». ML * course A WeSECRET L. 14/238/i/q.D. g 2. S» 4*(G, S» ) (Sir James Ross) (thro* E»49) Copy tos- S»9» Aviation Petrol Tanks - Bahrein I am somewhat difTident in expressing ary view on your draft letter to Ihe India Office. In the first place, I feel that it does not come within ny province as Deputy-Direct or of a Service Directorate to remark on what is purely a legal natter. In the second place, I am more than hesitant in commenting on three agreements of which I have not copies. For what it is worth, however, I am offering a few suggestions. 2. It is not stated in the minute to the Legal .Adviser of the Balia Ofiice, vtoare the Parties to the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement Uiere is no suggestion that the Bahrein Petroleum Conpany is a Party rx&gt;r do I see why they should be. If I am right in my assunption that they are not Parties, then I do not see how the fact that His l&amp;jesty^ Government have been granted the sole right to supply fuel and lubricants to users of the airfield can in any way affect the Bahrein Conpany who were, by the Deed of L 0 dif ication dated 19th June, 1940, given the exclusive right to construct and operate refineries and storage tanks in Bahrein. This right is ati ected by Article 7 of the Political Agreement between H. 14 (4 and the Bahrein Company which barred the Conpary from using areas required ty H. H G. for defence puiposes for airfields. This Article did not, I suggest, envisage tanks being erected in these areas by conpetitors of the company but was directed to preventing the areas becoming encuiibered ard obstructed by tanks. 3. The position would seem to be that if the Anglo-Irani an Oil Conpary is enployed by us to erect storage tanks on our airfield then unless the Bahrein Petroleum Company were Parties to the Bahrein Civil Air .agreement, biey night well have a right of action against the Sheik who can be said to have granted H. 14 G. rights which are inconpatible with the exclusive licence given to the Bahrein Conpary by the Deed of Modification. I am assuming, as I think we may, that H.11 G. have implied lights under the Bahrein Civil Air^Agreement to erect tanks to enable them to simply fiel to users of the airfield. The Bahrein Coiipany might also endeavour by means of injunction or otherwise to prevent the Anglo-Iranian Oil Coup any irora proceeding with the work of erecting tanks on our airfield. 4* A3 I have said, I have not seen the Agreements but the above may be the legal position. If this position is in doubt perhaps it would be as well not to argue too nuch on it. You will see from What I have writ,an tnat I do not feel that I can agree with the ccnclusions which you have drawn in your letter nor am I convinced that tie comnon sense view you put forward is of necessity the one which would prevail as surely the terms of the agreement are the prime factors.

I suggest that you should read the Political Resident's telegrams Nos.437 and 430, the note of the meeting on march 11th and l.lr. Peel's note ok j.Iarch 13th. A sketch map is flagged showing trie location of the aerodrome and seaplane base. The following appear to be the relevant portions of the various agreements involved:- (1) Article 2^ of the Deed of Modification dated 19 th June, 1940, of the 1 Vikas e between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Bahrain Petroleum Company: 'The Shaikh hereby grants the Company on behalf of himself and his successors for the same period the exclusive right to construct and operate refineries and storage tanl:s within the Shaikh's present and future dominions.’.. (2) Article 7 of the Political Agreement between H.1I.G-. and the Bahrain Petroleum Company regarding their oil concession: 'Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement between the Company and the Shaikh the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy, an d shall not include ~UTthe areas selected for theli^u^ta. of its operations any sites which may have been selected # by or on behalf of the Shaikh H.iUC. for defence purposes for aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane bases ...^ / (3) Article 11 of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement. 'H.ll.G. shall have the sole right to supply either directly or through their agents fuel and lubricants to users of the aerodrome”. The Bahrain Civil, Air Agreement is actually of an earlier date than the please of 1934. The use of the aerodrome by British military aircraft is covered by the exchange of letters appended to the Civil Air Agreement. The main points on which we should like your views are (l) can the Bahrain Petroleum Company claim the right to operate the oil tanks to supply petrol to aircraft on the aerodrome, or can H.II.G. under Article 11 of the Civil Air Agreeme nt. nominate whatever agents they choose for this purpos^y (2J Could we use the Political Agreement to overrule the Bahrain Compary 1 s rights under Article of the Deed of Modification even as regards the erection of oil tanks? ft‘A' I frrrcr The matter is hy no means free from doubt, but I would be inclined to regard the position as follows, I think in the first place that, inasmuch as full effect could presumably be given to the sole right granted to His Majesty's Government under their agreement with the Sheildi dated,6th June 1934&gt; to supply fuel to users of the aerodromes established thereunder, without the actual erection or operation of storage tanks, it could not fairly be suggested that there was anything to prevent the Sheikh subsequently granting to the Bahrain Petroleum Company the exclusive right to erect and operate such tanks, Y/hen,however, the Company later agreed with His Majesty's Government under the Political Agreement of 29th June, 1940&gt; that nothing in their previous agreement with the Sheikh should give them the right ”to use or occupy'' or include in the areas selected for the purpose of their operations'any sites selected by His Majesty's Government for defence purposes for aerodromes, theyy^limited the area within which inter alia their exclusive right to erect and operate storage tanks could be exercised. In the circumstances - and apart altogether from such reliance as might be placed on their expressed desire (recited in the Political Agreement) to submit to the influence of His Majesty's Government within the Sheikh's territories - I do not think it could properly be contended that they would nevertheless be entitled to prevent others from erecting and operating storage tanks on the sites in question- A lL f ' v JfM A kA-. cvi-. /w &lt; yVv i * / . u!\ V' *CU~J 1^4. 2« Uk.Hr» Harrison, I saw tfr, Gass, a Director of the A.I.O.C.- on Thursday the 16th March. He explained that for a number of years his Company had been supplying B.O.A.C. (and its predecessor) with petrol on the air route along the Gulf. Hitherto petrol has been brought in from Abadan in tanks and drums and has been, poured straight into the bowsers on the aerodromes. With the increase in traffic, however, requirements are getting too big for this method to be maintained successfully and it is essential to be able to put up storage tanks. Until the point was raised recently by the Bahrein Petroleum Oil Company, Ms Company had no knowledge of the exclusive right of Bapco to construct and operate oil storage tanks in Bahrein and he wanted to find out what the position of Ms Company now was. Were they * in effect now excluded from operating on behalf of B.O.A.C. in Bahrein as they had been doing Mtherto/ I explained to Mr. Gass that the exclusive right to erect and operate oil storage tanks had been in Bapco*s earlier agreements but had then, of course, only applied to a particular area. When in 1940 the Company obtained a further concession wMch gave them the whole of the Sheikh*s territories, the exclusive right as to storage tanks was again included and tMs, of course, had the effect of giving them the exclusive right over the whole of Bahrein. Mr. Gass enquired whether they also had the exclusive right to s&amp;l^tf oil in Bahrein and I was able to assure him that paragraph 4 (c) of the agreement specifically excluded any such rigfrt. I told Mr. Gass that as far as I could see, although we had not yet had time fully to explore the position from its legal . aspect, there was nothing in the agreements to prevent Ms Company from continuing to operate, except that they could not erect storage tanks. Under the Civil Air agreement. Article 11, H.M.G. has the right to supply petrol either direct or through their Agents to users of the aerodrome and if they chose to select a.I.O.C. as their Agents, tMs would make the Company*s position unassailable, aspecially as there was a clause in the political agreement with the Bahrein Company that said that 'the company shall not have the right to use or occupy any sites wMch may have been selected by H.M.G. for aerodromes or sea-plane bases.” I explained to Mr. Gass/Gass that this was only ny own personal opinion of the position and if with a view to the future his Corapany wished the whole position to be cleared up, it would be best for him to take it up with the Petroleum Department in the first place. I understand from Mr. Berthoud that Mr. Gass is calling on him to-day. It seems clear, therefore, that we shall need to get the legal position clarified and I should be glad if you would take up with the Legal Adviser the various points involved, particularly the relation of the Civil Air agreement to the Oil Concession agreement and the extent to which we could use the political agreement to uring pressure to bear on the Bahrein Petroleum Oil Comp any 0 It would seem absurd for instance that if H.M.G-. wished to employ A.I.O.C., which is a British Company, as their Agents for the supply of petrol to aircraft using the Bahrein air base, they should be unable to do so simply because the Bahrein Company have the exclusive right to erect and operate the oil storage tanks. There can be no doubt whatever that this right was intended to be related solely to their operations as an oil producing concern and it never entered anyone *s head that it could be used as giving the Company any rights in regard to the supply of aerodromes. • « It was clear from our meeting the other day that the R.A.F. would take the line that in time of war at any rate the use of an aerodrome which has been granted to them by the i^heikh would include all the necessary facilities and they would certainly refuse to have their operational needs hampered by some right of the Oil Company in regard to storage tanks. I do not imagine that the Bahrein Petroleum Company, who are always co-operative, would in fact dispute this attitude^ but I feel some doubt whether from a strictly legal aspect, it would be possible to maintain it in the last resort.1 I A.M.

The Company objects to the installation of oil storage tanks on Muharraq Island or elsewhere within the domains of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain unless such installations are the property of the Company or the Company has the option of pur chasing same. The Company is willing to erect any tankage necessary for the use of the Royal Air Force at Muharraq and will endeavour to obtain the necessary materials, equipment and labour required. If, however, the Company is not able to install the tankage in the required time, the Company is prepared to enter into an agreement with the Royal Air Force whereby they supply and erect the tankage with the Company's assistance and at the Company's expense or with the right of purchase by the Company. The Company is agreeable to handling avhtion petrol shipped from Abadan in such tanks until such time as aviation petrol may be available from the Company's refinery. The Company is prepared to install at its expense a pine- line as required for the use of the Royal Air Force to the boundary of certain areas reserved by the Company.

I have to advise that the Company is not willing to sell or lease the Company property to your Company at this time. It was inferred from Mr. Grafton during the conversation thht the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited or the Rafidain Oil Company Limited is contemplating constructing storage tanks and certain oil installations in Bahrain Islands for fuelling of flying boats. I have to advise in this connection that the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited has the exclusive right to construct and operate storage tanks in the Bahrain Islands. In view of this, the Com pany will protest the construction and operation of storage tanks in' Bahrain Islands by your Company. This Company is prepared to erect storage tanks for the above purpose and to consider handling in them aviation gasoline shipped from Abadan dependent upon a satisfactory agreement being reached, until such time as aviation gasoline may be available from the Company^ refinery. I am not aware of the contemplated offtake ( of B.O.A.C. but believe the Company has suitable tanks available on the Island which could be installed in a short time. Will you please inform your Principals regarding the above. I f, •4. /3 3. Memorandum No.3AH/S.24/2/AIR dated the 10th February 1944 from the Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain, to the Air Headquarters, R.a.F. 1 Iraq and Persia, copy to the Political Agent, Bahrain. (Copy sent to the Hon*ble the Political Resident, Bushire, under Political Agency printed letter No.C/310 dated the 10th February 1944.) I• PROPOSED BULK AVIATION FUEL SUPPLIES - BAHRAIN I. In a recent conversation with Mr. ward Anderson reference was made to the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ Qoncession in which certain sole rights are vested in them in regard to H.H. n The Shaikh*s'* Domains. II. An informal note to the Political Agent on this subject has brought forth the attached correspondence. III. In amplification of BAPCO’s memorandum (Confidential C/PA-124) dated 8th February 1944, Mr. .tard Anderson and the A.L.O. met at the latter*s Offics at 0900 hrs. &amp;.T.;on 9th Feb. to discuss these problems. Iv « Notes on the Meeting . (H.B.M*s Political Agent left Bahrain early on the morning of the 9th and was therefore unable to be present.) 1. Mr. Anderson made it clear that the Company wished to retain full oimership of any Tankage constructed within the Concession Area, which covers the whole of H.H. Domains, and would therefore take up any lease of land required for such purpose. AT the same time he intimated that they wished to offer the fullest possible co-operation in these projects in order not to delay, in any way, the prosecution of the War. 2. Three alternatives present themselves in regard to the supply of the necessary tanks. (a) (i) BAPCO would be willing to supply and install 2 - 2000 Barrel Bolted tanks for Muharraq which, it is understood, have just been released from another of their projects. (ii) These tanks are Parkersberg, Rig and Reel tanks and would need to be dismantled and re-erected at Muharraq. (iii) Sufficient material to renew the Gaskets on one Tank only is available - the balance would hage to be supplied. (iv) If the necessary gasket material were available from out side sources, Mr. Anderson intimated that these tanks could be installed in one month from date of commencement. (b) (i) Bapco would be willing to purchase the 1000 Barrel Tanks referred to in Mr. Bowlby*s report under para 8 ^Summary of Recom mendations', sub para (d). (ii) Bapco would accept construction by outside agency under their own general supervision as stated in the third paragraph of their memorandum referred to above, provided of course that they become the owners of the installation. (c) (i) Bapco would be willing to purchase the 2 - 5000 Barrel Tanks and equipment referred to in the original scheme proposed by the USATC Representatives. (ii) Here again the same principle applies - They would accept installation on a contractor basis by either the RaF or USaTC . In this case, however, the USATC intimated that they would supply an installation complete with pumps etc., necessary to cope with both , *filling' of the Storage Tanks and also 'off-take' by Refuel ling Units.3, (i) In regard to the method of supply, Mr. Anderson, as is Mr. BowlbyJ.is in favour of the use of Tank Lorries rather than Pipe Line - at least until the dictates of future policy decide otherwise - and that therefore the most urgent need was to deter mine the maximum Wartime capacity of the Bridge on the Causeway. (ii) Mr. Anderson offered the services of Bapco f s Chief Engineer (Mr. Anderson) to examine the specifications of the Bridge for this purpose. The specifications have been obtained from State Engineer and handed over to Bapco. The results should be available soon and will be forwarded immediately. (iii) State Engineer contacted Holloway Bros, Baghdad in regard to using the Bridge for the suggested 4000 US. Gallon Tankers proposed by the USATC originally. Holloways, London cable back direct to the effect that M The Bridge was safe for axle weights 3 ton, 6 ton, 7 ton with 11 feet, 13 feet 4 feet centres respec tively” and this is now under'examination by BAPCO f s Chief Engineer. 4. Mr. iuiderson stated lie has every reason to believe that suffi cient suitable T'*nk Lorries could be made available from U.S.Army Sources with which to operate this scheme, but that there is the possibility that insufficient experienced Drivers would be availahfe It is suggested that these could be obtained from RAF sources (outside Bahrain) and hired to BAPCO for this work. V. Genera^ . 1. It is significant that both the Petroleum Division Representa tive (Mr. Bowlby) and Messrs. BAPCO favour the use of Tank Lorries in the initial stages until the decision is taken to install a 100;6 Pipe Line Job with the best materials.- 2. although it is regretted that Messrs. Bapco have not raised these points before, it seems reasonable that they should not be willing to waive their concessionary rights. 3. It is understood that the same queries have arisen between Messrs. Bapco and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Ltd., in regard to the proposed bulk Storage at the Marine Base, Manama, but no further information is yet available on this score. Para IV. 2 (a) add (v) Information is requested as to the type of gasket required for these tanks to stand up to 100 .Cetane Fuel. The type at present in use is the usual type of Rubber Gasket. (vi) No mention was made of assistance being required to carry out this proposal although it is possible that, with their own present programme, assistance might be required purely on a con tractor basis.Installation of* Oil Tanks tor Air Force reouirernents at Bahrein® ^ Note of a Meeting at the India Office on March tlie 11th, between ;^-;resentatives of the India Office, Foreign Office, Petroleum 1 Ision, and Air Ministry* &lt;3 Berthoud (Petroleum Division) explained that at present aviation spirit to meet requirements of the R*JUF* and U.S*A.A*F. at Bahrein wer*e beii% fciet by transport of aviation spirit in tins from Abadan^ ' * * l ^-he lack of storage 'tanks Sw the aerodrome ivas an inconvenience, and for this reason it was desirable to have them erected as soon as ' possi ble 0 Petrol would continue to be supplied from Abadan until theJrefinery at Bahrein was working, which was expected’ to be tliis summer* The Ainglo-Iranian Oil Company had no contracts to supply the h*A*J« 'v/ith aviation spirit, but they had contracts to supply the B*0&lt;,A«.C o over their whole route* He considered it was nnportant tliat the &lt; A®AoO*C. should be able to fulfil this contract to the B.OoAoC® after the War, and that it would be unfortunate if at Bahrein surrolv ./ar they v/ould market spirit produced from the Bahrein refinery as soon as this began to produce* There was no delay oi’ difficulty to be anticipated in the production of oil storage tanks by the A*I*0*C* for Bahrein* afk- P ee ?- pointed out that the legal position was that the Bahrein Pe croleum Company had the exclusive right to construct anfl {The faloO.G. accept^ the position that for the duration of the /under•* Under the Civil Air Agreement it was open to HolIcGo to use v/hatever agents they chose for the supply of petrol on the aerodrome, • The i r Ministry representatives urged, that the matter should be regarded primarily from the operational stand point.

As a result of the discussion it was decided that telegrams should be ‘sehf to the Political Resident and the A,0,C, Irak, to the effect that the best solution v/ould be for the R,A,P, to use the Bahrein Petroleum Company as their agents for the erection of the tanl:s, provided that this involved no undue delay. The R.A.P, would own the tanks when erected, and any land required would be obtained on lease by them and not sub-let. This would make it possible for the R.A,F, to use A,I,0,C, as their agents for supplying petrol’to the aerodrome, (ffhe A,i,0,C, might in fact obtain^petrol from the Bahrein Oil Company) and would preserve the Bahrein petroleum Company* s rights regarding erection of the tanks.'Nt Ext, 1014/Vf « 1 DRAFT TELEGRAM S *V From: Secretary of State for India, To: Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, repeated to the Government of India, External Affairs Department. tf) iJr ** Addressed Bushire repeated Government of v ^ ^ /s' / s' ^ * da.

Dear Harrison, Thank you for your letter of 7th March enclosing copy of a telegram No. 480 from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. f The statement attributed to Mr. Luard in the fifth paragraph 'of the telegram does not agree with the information at our disposal, since according to our records 36 American ships have bunkered at Bahrein from 1st January to 29^ February and 27 at Abadan. You may not be aware that an agreement was reached some time ago regulating the relative outputs of Abadan and Bahrein, and we had a telegram from the Ministry of War Transport Representative saying that the companies fully recognised that the offtake for bunkering was included in the agreement and that there way no complaint of excessive bunkering offtake at Bahrein.

This question of the petrol installations at Bahrein has so many i. unifications here that I am only now able to answer your letter of the 28th February:and only tentatively at that. Let me first enclose a copy of a telegram from Rear Air Headquarters, Iraq, dated l6th February, which you have not seen. This states that the R.A.F. will lease the land for these tanks and sub-lease it to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. This helps to maintain the position that we and not the Americans are principals in this matter and that the Bahrein Company are our agents. Para. 4 of this telegram is not correct. It is there stated that action on the proposals in the telegram is proceeding in anticipation of approval from here. Air Commodore Darvall (who was with Bowhill and is now back) tells me today this is not so. It remains therefore that instructions are awaited. The view taken here is that in the circumstances we would not object to action proceeding at once as proposed locally on the grounds stated in telegram 437 of 23rd February. (You will see that the two smaller tanks would be provided from R.A.F. local resources.) This is as proposed in your letter. We could even ourselves the larger tanks f rom the Company, and provide thou on that basis for the Americans. Then comes Berthoud’s letter of 6th March. The question is shifting to one of petrol supply, and we are quite ready to meet in conference as soon as you can arrange for this. Air Commodore Darvall tells me he would be available, with his recent local knowledge. f-A ^ ^ It is said that even we could not erect additional petrol storage, with the consent (of course) of the Sheikh, on the ground that the Bahrein Company has an exclusive right.

I have already discussed the subject matter of the enclosure to this letter with you and you will recollect that we have roughly surveyed the sites mentioned in para. 3. 3. You will note from para*3 of the dr Liaison Officer’s letter under reference that the Royal Air Force desire that negotiations for the lease of certain areas of land to them should be commenced as early as possible and that in addition they desire to lay a pipe line across the Ifuharraq-Manama causeway. I shall be grateful if the Land Department of the Bahrein Government will survey the sites at the earliest possible moment with a view to discovering whether they are Bahrein Government property or in private ownership. For this purpose I reooxjmend the suggestior made in paragraph 5 °f the Air Liaison Officer’s letter under reference be carried out. 2f. The ownership of the sites will of course determine the procedure to be followed when considering the lease. I shall there fore be glad if, should they be found to be Bahrein Goverunent property, the provisional approval of the Bahrein Government could be given to the lease on terms to be decided by negotiations between us on the basis suggested in para.6 of the Air Liaison Officer’s letter.

If any of the sites ore privately ovmed do you consider that the Bahrein Government would be prepared to acquire them by purchase iiaaediately or obtain an option to purchase so that there would be no difficulty in the lease negotiations if the Royal Air Force finally decide to proceed with the present plani# I understand that it has* been the custom in the past for the Bahrein ' Government to acquire private property for the purpose of leasing it to the Service Departments. 5* Since the Air Liaison Officer's letter has been received I have had a conversation with Group Captain Alexander who tells me that it has now been decided to take the pipeline right along the causeway and along the IWharraq sea road instead of as described in paragraph 3 of the Air Liaison Officer's letter. The pipe will be buried to a depth of twelve inches below the road surface and would I understand be most unlikely to cause any* inconvenience to the users of the causeway. 6. It is probable that if materials are available the petrol supply line wii.1 eventually* take the form of a pipeline seventeen miles long from the Refinery at Sitrah to the British Overseas Airways Corporation jetty and across the causeway as described above. This would of course be the most satisfactory arrangement as it would do away with intermediate pimping stations and the necessity for running heavy Tank Lorries, but, nothing definite has yet been decided and time iaay be required both to obtain official sanction and to discuss with the Bahrein Government the actual siting of the pipeline, to say nothing of the time required to carry out the actual construction. In the meantime I shall be glad, if the Bahrein v Government will approve the laying of the pipeline as described in my paragraph Nb.5 above. ^ I have, etc. * (Sd.)

This is to be utilised to house the llain W/H Transmitters, (c) Referring to Part 2 of the above signal, it has been confirmed that the bridge on the causeway will not carry the 18 ton Road Tanker, It will be necessaiy therefore to construct a pier on the north side of the causeway approximately 100 yards S#W* of the bridge opposite the present traffic turn-round on which to discharge and turn the Road Tankers concerned. The sise of the pier will need to be in the region of 50 yards square in order to effect a reasonable turn-around. A small puiqp-house and pump etc, will have to be constructed on one of the outside corners of the pier to effect a connection between the tank lorry and the necessary pipeline and the whole to be enclosed in a fence as a safety precaution. A 3' pipeline will need to be laid from the pump-house on the pier diagonally across the bay to the north, and on the sea bed to a convenient point at the road turning leading from the foreshore past the liuharraq School to the airfield and from that point to the proposed site for the storage tanks, (running past the school the line will be buried). A plot of ground 300 ft. x 300 ft. adjacent to and north of the road between the kuharraq School and the Cemetery Mosque will need to be acquired for the installation of the airfield bulk storage. 4* May negotiations be started with the Bahrain Government for the acquisition of these lands etc. in the terms of the signal quoted above. 5.

In particular, the distribution of contracts for refuelling services between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) and the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO). It therefore covers developments at the Manama Sea Plane Anchorage and the Muharraq Aerodrome. A great deal of correspondence in the file focuses on legal discussion over the extent of BAPCO's monopoly over the erection of bulk fuel storage tanks in Bahrain, and whether this overrules the right of the British Government to provide refuelling facilities at aerodromes granted under the Bahrain Civil Aviation Agreement.A sketch map showing a proposed oil pipeline from Sitra Island to the landing ground on Murharraq Island can be found on folio 59.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Sir Charles Geoffrey Prior and Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the India Office (Horace Algernon Fraser Rumbold, and Roland Tennyson Peel), officials of the Ministry of Fuel and Power (Eric Alfred Berthoud, Keith Lievesley Stock, and W D Mansell-Davis), and local RAF authorities.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
