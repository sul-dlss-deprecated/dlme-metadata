Dated, the 1st March 193 To . essrs John Blake Limited, Accrington Lancashire. Dear Sirs, I am considering installing a ram to lift water for domestic use to a cistern at the top o’ the Political Agency House. 2 . The water is piped from an artesian well source. A one inch tap fills a four gallon kerosene oil tin in one and an half minutes (possibly the flow dir-ect from tlie pipe would be a little qu cker as ^he tap is not a good one and is about 2 feet above the piping level). I can arrange a drop of three feet from the piping to just above sea level of the highest tide. The water has an high salt contents but is drimcable(with slightly epsom salts results). The sa e supply would be used for wording the ram and to be lifted. The cistern is to be about 35 feet above the level of the pining. The quantity of water lifted is to be enough to fill a 600(six hundred) gallon tank in the course of the 24 hours. The highest expenditure of water will be for baths in the roming, say 07.00 to 08.00 hours, and again in the evening about 19.00 to 20.00 h urs, and in the meantime washing up after meals. The climate is hot and damp in the hot entaer and cold | (but never freezing) in the cold weather* Iron work rusts with great rapidity. 3. X sh &gt;uld be glad of your advice and, if you think that a ra» will suit these conditions, an estimate c.i.f.

Sir, 17e thank you for yours of the Isf. and enclose a copy oi our illustrated catalogue of self-acting Hydi arns for raising water a perusal of which we trust may prove of interest and service. You will observe our machines are made in two classes- the 'A' type which raise a portion of the same water which drives them, and the 'B” type which while driven by impure wa^ei , i aise purer water obtained from another source. She situation you describe appears to be puite suitable for the use of a small Hydrarn of our rt A rt type but we fear it will not be practicable to raise quite as much water to the high level as you Vindicate - that is with a working fall of say 5 feet and B.6 gallons of driving water per minute. As a matter of fact with a working fall of 5 feet and 2.6 gallons of driving water per minute the Hydram we have in mind would raise 2^0 gallons per day of 24 hours to the vertical height— • •-*' —rrr mrnmm -([- 111 ^■pij|ii jnn! r - 2 - © u K^l ■ Lt.Col.Loch. 15 March 1934 Of 4 C feet throush say a f« bore or any lareer bore delivery pipe.

We note you would prefer to fix the Hydram below the sea wall. This would be in order providing of course the Hydram is fixed so that the waste water can be drained off from the ram-house floor to the sea.

How many farmers, because their grandfathers did it before them, persist in the same old methods of obtain ing their water supply, using the laborious hand pump, or carting water long distances for the farm buildings and stock ? These methods might have paid in their grandfathers’ day, but now with the scarcity and high cost of labour such conduct only makes for the bankruptcy court. Contrast the two pictures on this page. In the first the horse, cart, and man are probably engaged one to three hours a day in the summer months at a cost of anything up to five or even ten shillings per day. In the second, the farmstead has an abundant supply of water for dairy, stables, cattle, and milk cooling, at a total cost of say five to ten shillings per annum for repairs and renewals to the small hydram, no fuel, nor oil, nor packing, nor labour being required for it.

Materials of Construction. Strength of Design. Ease of Adjustment. No Oiling or Packing. No cost for Motive Power No attention Required. Cost of Repairs and Renewals. We have now been making and fixing Hydrams for 59 years, and our experience now enables us to turn out a machine of the most perfect type for the situation in which it is required to work. Our machines are of extraordinarily strong and massive con struction. All the valves and fittings are of the best gun-metal or bronze. The bodies and air vessels are of massive cast-iron of great strength and thickness. Instead of the thin flanges ordinarily used by other firms, these are made of great thickness to resist great strain and rough usage. All other Ram makers fit the ordinary wrought-iron nuts on the bolts used in their machines. These generally rust fast after a few months, and often when the ram has to be examined, it is necessary to cut the bolts before the flanges can be removed. To avoid this difficulty, we have for over 50 years always fitted gun-metal or bronze nuts to the bolts of our Hydrams, and make them of double depth to prevent the thread stripping. These can be removed with the greatest ease even 20 years after they are put on. This is a very important feature for a machine that has always to work in water or a damp atmosphere. The waste, delivery, and suction valves of most of the Hydrams are so made that a strong boy or farm labourer can put in a new set of clacks in a few minutes, as no filing, grinding, or fitting is necessary. The Hydrams never require oiling nor packing, and there is no cost whatever for motive power, as that is obtained from the water passing through the Hydram. They require little, if any, attention further than a casual inspection, say, once a month, after they have been properly adjusted, and many of our Hydrams have worked 12 months at a time without being seen once. See testimonial on page 34, referring to a Hydram which had been working for seven years without stopping once. The design of the Hydram is so simple, and the wear and tear so slight, that except for the very large sizes, the annual cost of repairs and renewals to the Hydrams only averages from 3/- to 10/- even Registered Trade Mark—“ HYDRAM.”after they have been working many years, and with waters which are not corrosive to gun-metal (and very few waters are), these Hydrams will be found nearly as good in 50 years as they are when first fixed. Even for the larger Hydrams and “ B ” Hydrams, the annual cost of repairs and renewals seldom averages more than 20/- to 30/- after they have been in use 15 to 20 years. Hydrams of Hydrams are divided into two classes : “ A ” type and “ B ” Two Kinds. type. “A” Type Hydrams Raise Part of Driving Water. Driving Water Required. These raise a part of the same water that works them. The exact amount of water raised depends upon the working fall and the vertical height to which the water has to be raised above the Hydram. The smallest sizes can be driven by small springs or streams delivering as little as half a gallon of water per minute, whilst the larger sizes can utilise streams of 2,000 to 3,000 gallons per minute. Adjustable to Work with Varying Quantities. They can be adjusted to work with any quantity of driving water from their maximum capacity to less than one-half thereof, so that, in cases where a stream or spring driving a Hydram is subject to diminution in a dry season, the Hydram can be adjusted accordingly. Working fall Required. The “A” type will work with any fall down to 15-in. (if the height to force the water be not very great in proportion), but the greater the working fall the less the cost of the Hydram to raise a given quantity of water, and the less water is required to drive it. Sizes made. They are made in sizes to raise any quantity of water from 150 gallons per day up to 500,000 gallons per day. ■i; vHave you a suitable place for a Hydram ? The first point to ascertain is : have you a stream of flowing water anywhere on your own land which would answer your purpose ? A well without an overflow is of no use to work a Hydram. You must have a stream, no matter how small, of flowing water. Where plenty of working fall can be got, a flow of even one gallon per minute will do to work a Hydram for small supplies. The majority of Hydrams are worked by water either issuing from small springs or else by water taken from small brooks or burns. Wherever there is an old mill or water wheel or turbine a Hydram can always be worked. The next point to ascertain is : to what height and distance do you wish to raise the water ? The horizontal distance to which the water has to be forced is of no consequence to the practicability of the scheme (only to the expense of carrying it out), because Hydrams can be made to force to a horizontal distance of five miles as easily as to a distance of 500 yards, providing the vertical height to which the water has to be raised is the same. But the vertical height to which the water has to be forced has everything to do with the practicability, because the greater the height and the more powerful is the Hydram required, and the less water can be raised by a given quantity of driving water. The next question to answer, and it is generally the most important one of all, is : How much working fall can you get ? Now in cases where there is a dam or weir in a stream, or a natural water-fall, this question can be easily answered, but in the case of sluggish streams or springs rising in flat land, the answer is not so apparent. Therefore, in the case of sluggish streams, ask yourself this question : What is the difference of level between the surface of the water in the stream at one point, and the surface of the stream 100, 200, 300, or 500 yards further up or further down stream ? Even if the stream is so sluggish that the difference of level between two points 500 yards apart is only four or five feet, it is quite sufficient to work a Hydram, if there be plenty of driving water. In the case of small springs on flat land, the point to ascertain is : Have you any drain or ditch within 200 or 300 yards of the spring at a lower level than the spring, to which you could run the waste driving water from the Hydram, and if so how much is this drain or ditch below the spring ? The next point to ascertain is : What is the least number of gallons per day of 24 hours the Hydram must raise ? Hydrams are made in sizes to raise any quantity of water, from 150 gallons per day of 24 hours to 500,000 gallons per day. But a Hydram that will raise any given quantity at full power can be adjusted in a few minutes to raise only half that quantity, or less, if necessary. Lastly, if the supply of driving water is not practically unlimited then an attempt should be made to measure the quantity of water flowing, for methods of doing which see pages 28, 29 and 30.Advantages of Blake’s Hydrams 9 No Goal No Oil. No Packing. No Labour No Costly Repairs. No Skilled Management. No Damage from Frost. No Large Reservoir Required. Replacement Sent by Post Small Working Fall Required. High Efficiency. Quiet Working. Ease of Adjust ment for vari able amount of driving water. 1. —No coal or oil required for fuel. The only fuel required is the driving water, and if that varies in quantity the Hydram can be adjusted accordingly. 2. —No oil required for lubrication. There are no parts whatever in our Hydrams which require oiling. 3. —No packing necessary. There are no piston glands requiring constant packing, or pistons requiring new leathers putting on. 4. —No cost for labour. The Hydrams require practically no attention other than an occasional inspection to see that all is right. The majority of our Hydrams can be left for months at a time without being even seen, and we have known several cases where the Hydram-house door had not been opened for several years, and the Hydram working well all the time. See letter on page 34, regarding a Hydram that worked for seven years without having been seen once. 5. —Little or no cost for repairs and upkeep. For evidence as to the low cost of upkeep of our Hydrams, see Testimonials on page 10. 6. —They can be managed by a farm servant or unskilled labourer. Our Hydrams are so simple that no mechanical or technical knowledge is required other than the simple instructions we give. 7. —Immunity from damage during frosty weather. Blake’s Hydrams are so constructed that they are seldom or never damaged by frost, and in the severe winter of 1892-1893 we heard of only two Hydrams, out of the many thousands we have fixed, being damaged by frost, and those in so slight a degree, that an outlay of a few shillings put them right. 8. —Small storage tank only required. As the Hydrams work 24 hours per day, and are only liable to be stopped for a very short time at once, for cleaning, etc., very large storage tanks are not needed, and a large saving is thereby effected. 9. — Easiness with which they can be repaired or rectified. In the majority of cases if anything does go wrong with the Hydram, a new set of valve clacks can be sent by letter post, and no skill is required to put them in, as it is only a few minutes’ trouble. Our Hydrams are unique in this respect. 10. —Our Hydrams will work with less fall and force to greater heights and distances than any other Rams. 11. —They will raise more water and give a greater percentage of efficiency than any other Rams. 12. —The majority of our Hydrams are almost noiseless, and work with very little “ shock ” and vibration. Some of the Rams supplied by other firms are so noisy that the sound is carried up the rising main, and causes a great nuisance and inconvenience to the inmates of the house supplied by the Ram. We have taken out many Rams by other makers for this reason alone. 13 . —They can be adjusted to work with any quantity of driving water from their maximum down to less than one half, so that if a Hydram be worked from a spring which falls off considerably in dry weather, the Hydram can be adjusted accordingly.Durability and Low Cost of Up-keep of Blake’s Rams and Hydrams In order to obtain reliable evidence as to the durability of our Hydraulic Rams, we have written to a few of our very old customers to enquire if the Hydrams we had supplied to them were still at work and working well, and below we give their replies. In not a single instance did anyone reply that the Hydram had not been satisfactory. After working 24 years. From the Right Hon. The EARL OF GRANARD, K.P., P.C., Castle Forbes, Newtownforbes, March 8th, 1903. Gentlemen —In reply to your note of the 13th February, 1903, I beg to state that the Hydraulic Ram erected for my late father 24 years ago continues to give every satisfaction. Yours faithfully, GRANARD. 17 years later. From the Right Hon. The EARL OF GRANARD, K.P., P.G., Castle Forbes, Newtownforbes, July 26th, 1920. Gentlemen — In the year 1879 you put up a Hydram for my father here which worked perfectly until 1910. In my absence abroad two new Rams of another make were put in to replace yours. I had nothing but trouble with these Rams, and should not have allowed any Ram other than yours to have been put up had I been aware of it. These two Rams were removed last year, and were replaced by one of yours, which as I expected has given every satisfaction. After working 36 years. From the Right Hon. The EARL OF GAINSBOROUGH, Exton Court, Oakham, Rutland, 22nd July, 1920. The Earl of Gainsborough begs to say in reply to Messrs. John Blake Limited’s letter of the 12th instant, that the Hydram they supplied in 1884 is still working satisfactorily, and has done so all along, and beyond ordinary repairs has never been out of order. After working 33 years. From the Right Hon. The EARL OF ROMNEY, 2 Herbert Crescent, London, S.W., October 25th, 1911. Sirs— I am glad to say in reply to your letter of October 5th, that the Hydraulic Ram which you supplied in the year 1878, for Gayton Hall, is still in working order, and gives every satisfaction. Yours faithfully, ROMNEY. 7/3 in 9 years. From the Right Hon. LORD CLIFFORD of Chudleigh, Ugbrooke Chudleigh, May 10th, 1897. Lord Clifford has much pleasure in informing Mr. John Blake that the Hydram he sent him nine years ago is still working very satisfactorily, and has been working about three hours a day since he had it. The new parts supplied by him, at the cost of 7/3, are the only repairs it has needed.El * r r r After working 24 years. After working 38 years. From Sir ROBERT MENZIES, Bart., D.L., J.P., Castle Menzies, Aberfeldy, N.B., February 14th, 1903. Dear Sir — I am glad to say the Hydraulic Ram on the River Erochd, in Rannoch, which supplies the two Shooting Lodges of Camserochd and Rannoch Lodge, is still working quite well, and it must be about 24 years since it was first put up (in 1879 or 1880), and it goes quite regularly still, and it is only once since that it has required to have some repairs done to it. Faithfully yours, ROBERT MENZIES. From Admiral Sir DAY H. BOSANQUET, G.C.V.O., K.C.B., Brom-y-Clos, Hereford, 31st March, 1919. Sir—I consider the Hydraulic Ram which you supplied to me 38 years ago, and installed at Brom-y-Clos, Hereford, a remarkable success. The Machine has now run day and night for 38 years, although I have understood that the fall is only 3-ft. 2-in. (however that may be), the Machine has during the whole course of that time driven 3,000 gallons of water daily to the top of the house, and supplied my stables and small farm-yard with water. The expense during the whole of this period for repairs to the Machine has amounted to only £17 14s. 5d., inclusive of £4 for new patent type of delivery valve. I sometimes notice the failure of Hydraulic Rams by other makers which have been installed in the neighbourhood, and I always find that they have been supplied too small for the work, or else badly installed. Yours faithfully, DAY H. BOSANQUET, Admiral. From JOHN ROWE BENNION, Esq., J.P., Nursted House, Petersfield, Hants., 15th July, 1920. After working Sirs —The two Hydrams I had from you 40 years ago are doing 40 years. their work well, they lift water 148-ft. and give great satisfaction here. During the whole time I have had these Hydrams the cost for repairs has only been £33 12s. 7d., or 7/9 per Hydram per annum. Yours truly, JOHN ROWE BENNION. From the Rev. H. J. DE SALIS, M.A., J.P., Portnall Park, Virginia Water, October 25th, 1911. Afterjworking 33^years. 1 have pleasure in stating that the Hydram with which you supplied me 33 years ago is still working quite satisfactorily. H. J. DE SALIS. 1112 1IYDRAMS FORCING WATER OVER 4i MILES. From JOHN BOYD BRODIE, Esq., M.I.G.E., 141 West George Street, Glasgow, 25th January, 1921. The two Hydrams which were installed in 1912 for the water supply to the Estate of Mellerstain, belonging to the late Lord Binning, are capable of raising 9,000 gallons of water per day from a spring yielding 52 gallons per minute, to a service reservoir, situated at a level of 92-ft. 4-in. above the Hydrams, the length of rising main being 23,200-ft. or over 4| miles in length. Besides pumping water to the service reservoir, from which a 7-in. main leads to the Mansion House, there are six farms supplied with water direct from the rising main. The Hydrams continue to give entire satisfaction. The cost of repairs and renewals throughout the past eight years has been about 11/- per annum for each Hydram. Considering their size and the simple methods adopted for their adjustment, 1 consider them highly efficient hydraulic machines, and feel justified in recommending their use wherever the circumstances are suitable. J. B. BRODIE, M.lnst.C.E. HYDRAMS FORCING TO A HEIGHT OF 719 FEET. From Sir GILBERT GREENALL, Bart., Walton Hall, Warrington, February 20th, 1899. Gentlemen— I am pleased to say the pair of patent “ B ” Hydrams with rising main pipe, which you fixed for me last autumn for the supply of water to my stud farm has proved a thorough success. The Hydrams are worked by impure water with a fall of only 9-ft., and force over 4,500 gallons of pure spring water per day to a distance of 1,233 yards, and to the very great height of 719-ft., that is about 80 times the height of the working fall. I certainly believe that your system is the most economic I could adopt to get the water required to the elevation named. Yours faithfully, GILBERT GREENALL. From LORD EUSTACE CECIL, Lytchett Heath, Poole, Dorset, February 14th, 1921. In reply to Messrs. Blake’s letter, Lord E. Cecil writes to say that the Hydram fixed by them goes admirably, and if properly cleaned and attended to is both satisfactory and inexpensive. This Hydram took the place of one by another maker which was not satisfactory. From The Right Hon. LORD CRANWORTH, Grundisburgh Hall, Woodbridge, Suffolk, 8th February, 1921. Gentlemen —I am very pleased to tell you that the Hydram erected by you for me last year is working excellently and that I now have a supply of water more than adequate. When I bear in mind the extremely small head of water available—a bare trickle— and the fact that experts who were previously consulted stated that it was almost an impossibility, I consider the result to be a great feather in your cap. Yours faithfully, CRANWORTH.I t II r % &lt;• Opinions of Renowned Civil Engineers (Specialists in Town and Village Water Supply). Copy of Letter from Messrs. BERRING I ON &amp; SON, Civil and Consulting Engineers. Prudential Chambers, Lichfield Street, Wolverhampton, 12th February, 1927. Dear Sirs— It gives us much pleasure to certify that the many Hydraulic Rams of your manufacture which we have put in during the last 25 years have, without exception, given entire satisfaction to our Clients. The installation of your pattern “ B ” type Hydrams which you have recently completed for the supply of water to the Village of Garth, is worthy of mention, owing to the exceptional circumstances. We specified that the Hydrams should be capable of raising to the High Level Reservoir, a lift of 672 feet, 10,000 gallons of water per 24 hours through a rising main 7,500 feet in length, or 15,000 gallons per 24 hours to the Low Level Reservoir, a lift of 338 feet, through a rising main 4,700 feet in length. We are glad to say that, on making a test recently, we found that the Hydrams were capable of delivering more than the volume specified, and that the supply to the Village is giving entire satisfaction.

Blake Ltd., of Accrington, Lancs., on the above Waterworks, has proved eminently satisfactory. The slope of the ground was unfavourable to the ordinary type of drive pipe, and a standpipe was consequently arranged so as to give the proper pulsations of the Hydram. The Hydram was required to raise 9,000 gallons of water per day, but actually raised 10,000 gallons, or about 11 per cent, more than the requirements. The Hydram has given every satisfaction ; it works smoothly, and keeps the Village well supplied with water - (Signed) TAYLOR &amp; WALLIN, Engineers to Longtown R.D.C. From Messrs. FAIRBANK &amp; SON, M.I.C.E., Lendal Chambers, York, 27th January, 1921. BEDALE AND AISKEW WATER SUPPLY (YORKS.) Dear Sirs— In reply to your enquiry of the 7th instant, the two Hydrams you supplied for the Bedale and Aiskew Waterworks some 10 years ago, are still working quite satisfactorily, and the total amount paid to you for repairs and renewals during that period is only £23 8s. 7d., or say, £2 7s. Od. per annum. As the Hydrams cost nothing for fuel or lubrication and next to nothing for attention, this result is very satisfactory. This water supply scheme is rather remarkable on account of the very small water power available having been made so much use of. The total available gross horse power of the water used for the two Hydrams was under 1 H.P., and yet the Hydrams raise 30,000 gallons of the spring water per day, to the High Level Service Reservoir for the supply of the town, at a height of 88 feet above the Hydrams, and at a distance of 820 yards. One Hydram is of your 'A” type driven by 42 gallons of spring water per minute gravitated to it from a distance of rather over a mile and the other Hydram being of your “ B ” type, driven by a supply of 82 gallons per minute, of beck or brook water, and raising the waste spring water from the “A” type Hydram. The probable alternative to the Hydram Scheme would have been to put down, say, an Oil Engine and Pump, to raise the water in eight hours daily, with less efficiency of motive power and necessitating much larger mains, larger storage reservoir for the spring water, and of course entailing a large annual expenditure for fuel, attendance, etc. Yours faithfully, FAIRBANK &amp; SON, M.I.C.E., M.I.W.E. 13Estimates and Prices Will be given on receipt of the following particulars : 1st.—The fall (in feet or inches), which can be obtained from the stream, lake, or other source of supply. 2nd.—The height to which the water is to be forced above the level of the Hydram. 3rd.—The distance to which the water has to be forced. 4th.—The approximate quantity of water (in pints or gallons) falling per minute. 5th.—The number of gallons required to be raised per day of 24 hours. 6th.—The distance in which the working fall is obtained. 7th.— If a “ B ” Hydram be required, the depth and horizontal distance from the Hydram to the clean water should be stated, unless the clean water will gravitate to the level of the Hydram. “A” HYDRAMS raise part of the same water that works them. “ B ” HYDRAMS work with impure water, whilst raising pure water from aspring or shallow well. Additional Particulars required in cases where Hydrams are required to replace Unsatisfactory Rams by other makers. A large proportion of the Hydrams we supply are to replace Rams by other makers which are not satisfactory, and which have been put in in the first place on account of their low price. In such a case we require the following information :— 1st.—The length and bore of the existing drive-pipe, and how long in use. 2nd.—The length and bore of the rising main, and how long in use. In taking the working fall on an old Hydram it should be measured from the surface of the water over the mouth of the drive pipe, to the escape outlet of the waste or “ pulse ” valve of the Hydram. We cannot quote Prices without first having the information asked for above. Would-be purchasers are often surprised that our Catalogue does not give any Prices, but it is almost impossible to do so. The cost of a Hydram depends on at least four things, which are never the same in two cases consecutively, that is on the working fall and quantity of driving water available, height to force, and amount of water to be raised, and therefore it is next to impossible to quote even approximate prices without at least having answers to the questions Nos. 1, 2, and 5 above. Inclusive Prices quoted for the Hydram with its drive and delivery pipes delivered and fixed, including tanks, service pipes and fittings, cattle troughs, and drinking bowls.Hydram worked by a Small Spring. # ft This view shows a small spring issuing from a bank or side of a hill, at the rate of three gallons per minute. By placing the Hydram in the hollow at a distance of about 60-ft. from the spring outlet, a working fall of 12-ft. is obtained on to the Hydram, and a supply of 500 gallons of the spring water per day is forced to the small homestead at a height of 80-ft. above the Hydram and at a distance from it of about 700 yards. If, by following the spring up the bank, to obtain it at a higher level, a working fall of, say 24-ft. could be obtained, then the Hydram would raise 1,000 gallons of water per day out of the same quantity of driving water. Or if by placing the Hydram further away from the spring, a greater fall can be obtained, then more water can be obtained even though it increase the vertical height to raise the water above the level of the Hydram. 15Applications of Blake’s Hydrams. No. II. Hydram worked by Spring on River Bank. This view shows a spring of water issuing from the ground on the bank of a river and used to drive a Hydram with a working fall of 3-ft. to force 1,000 gallons of the same water per day to a service tank in the roof of the Manor House for domestic use, and 1,500 gallons per day to a tank in the roof of the barn for the supply of Stables, Gardens, Dairy, etc. Sometimes the spring water may have to be carried for 100 to 200 yards in the direction of down stream, before sufficient working fall can be obtained. In such a case as this, if the spring does not yield enough water to work the Hydram, or if sufficient working fall cannot be obtained for it from the spring level (either by damming it up or by following it further up into the bank to intercept it at a higher level, or by sinking the Hydram in a chamber in the ground and laying a long earthenware pipe from the bottom of it to drain off the waste driving water to a lower level of the river), then often a “ B ” Hydram may be used, worked by the impure river water with 2 to 3-ft. fall, and let it raise part or the whole of the spring water.17 Applications of Blake’s Hydrams. No. III. Hydram worked by Water from a Pond or Lake. This view shows a Hydram worked by water from a pond or lake a few feet below which the Hydram is placed, the waste driving water from the Hydram flowing into the pond or stream nearest to it at a lower level. A Hydram can generally be worked in such a case as this, even if the Hydram may have to be placed 100 to 200 yards from the pond or lake to obtain sufficient working fall. If the pond or lake water be not sufficiently pure for the desired purpose, then it may be used to drive a Hydram of the “ B ” type to pump up any purer water which can be gravitated to it from any conveniently situated spring or well, or it may raise part of the same pond water after it has been passed through filtering beds. If the supply of pond water be ample for the purpose required, then any working fall down to 18-in. to 2-ft. is sufficient, though the greater the fall available, the smaller the Hydram required to raise a given quantity of water.• . a' « v 18 •V Applications of Blake’s Hydrams. No. IV. Hydram worked by Water from a Brook or River, the working fall or head being obtained from a Dam or Weir placed across the brook. The Hydram is shown raising water to a high level service reservoir for the supply of the village. Where the quantity of driving water available is limited and it is desirable to raise as much water as possible, the necessary working fall may be obtained partly by damming up the stream as shown above and partly by adopting the method shown on page 23. Where a Hydram is driven from a sluggish stream with only a small working fall, the Hydram may be subject to immersion in flood time, but if the floods are only of short duration this is generally found no great inconvenience.APPLICATIONS OF BLAKES HYDRA MS.Hydram worked by Water from a Brook or River, the fall being obtained without damming up the stream. (For explanation, see page 23.)* 23 Applications of Blake’s Hydrams. No. V. Hydram worked by Water from a Brook or River, the fall being obtained by laying an earthenware pipe along the bank of the stream for a distance of 100 to 200 yards (this pipe being laid nearly level), until a fall of 5 to 6-ft. can be obtained. The Hydram raises 10,000 gallons of water per day to the Mansion on the hill at a height of 300-ft. above the Hydram and one mile distant from it. Instead of using an earthenware pipe to carry the water, it may be conveyed in an open channel or canal cut along the bank of the stream. See illustration on page 25.I* % h The view above shows one of our “ B ” type Hydrams driven by the Mill Pond Water with a fall of 5-ft., and forcing up 30,000 gallons of water per day from the small spring of pure water rising on the opposite bank of the stream to a service reservoir on the hill 200-ft. above the Hydram and 1,000 yards distant from it, and from which the water gravitates for the supply of the village and surrounding farmsteads. *k. 0 025 Applications of Blake’s Hydrams. No. VII. | The Hydram in this case is worked by a fall of 15 feet obtained in the small river by running the driving water in an open channel or canal contoured along the bank for a considerable distance to a small concrete well placed on the mouth of the drive pipe of the Hydram, the working fall or head then being obtainable in a short distance. This is a very usual method of obtaining the necessary working fall in the Colonies and out-of-the-way places abroad where large bore piping is not easily obtainable. The Hydram then raises 10,000 gallons of water per day for the supply of a large farm, at a height of 150 feet above the river, branches being taken out of the rising main to supply cattle troughs on the way to the farm buildings. Where a river is subject to floods the Hydram can be placed in an underground chamber in the bank, out of the way of any possible damage.f Applications of Blake’s Hydrams. No. VIII. Hydram worked by Water rising from an Artesian Well or Borehole. Borehole. In districts where by sinking a borehole to an underlying water-bearing stratum, the water is found to rise a few feet above the surface of the ground, then a Hydram may be used to raise part of that water to a much higher level. The view above shows such a case as this, the borehole delivering 15 gallons of water per minute at a level of 8-ft. above the ground, or 10-ft. above the Hydram, and the latter raises part of this water at the rate of 3,000 gallons per day to a service tank fixed on a steel tower 50-ft. above the Hydram for the supply of the farm homestead, cattle troughs being supplied from the rising main at various points on the way. The surplus water is raised to watering places on the sheep runs beyond the homestead at an elevation of 200-ft. above the Hydram. As these boreholes generally deliver more water at a lower level and less water at a higher level, the Hydram is made adjustable to pass various quantities of driving water so that the most effective level and quantity of driving water may be utilised on the machine 427 NOTES ON ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS ON PAGE 14. (7&amp;) 1. —Working Fall.— Any working fall, from 18-ins. up to 100-ft., will do to work a Hydram, but the more working fall obtained up to about one-half of the total height the water has to be raised above the Hydram, and the less the Hydram will cost to raise a given quantity of water, and the less driving water will be required to lift that quantity. So that if driving water is very scarce or if you wish to raise as much water as possible, then get all the working fall you can. But where driving water is plentiful it is often less costly to be content with a small working fall and a more powerful Hydram, than go to the expense of obtaining the greater fall for the sake of enabling a smaller Hydram to do the work. If there be plenty of driving water a fall of four feet is sufficient to force to a height of 800 feet, but, of course, with such a small fall the Hydram would be very expensive for the quantity of water it would raise. In very sluggish streams which are not very wide, and the banks are high enough, the cheapest and easiest way to obtain a working fall is to place a dam in the stream, but very often this is not admissible. Then to obtain the fall it is necessary to take the driving water out of the stream in an open channel or in an earthenware pipe, laying the latter nearly level along the bank some distance down stream, until sufficient fall can be got in a short distance. The sketch below shows a very usual way of bringing working fall to bear on a Hydram. A The Hydram. F Level of Water at Spring, Pond, or Stream, and Top of Working Fall. B Injection Pipe. G Level of Waste Outlet Valve of Hydram and Bottom of Working Fall. D Feed Tank. H The Hydram House. E Power Water Feed Pipe. J Waste Water Outlet Pipe. The effective fall is estimated from the surface of the water in tank D, when the Hydram is at work, to the level of waste outlet valve of Hydram G.V 28 2. — Height to Force. —The height to force must be calculated from the level of the Hydram or bottom of the working fall. The greater the height to force the water, the more powerful must the Hydram be, to raise a given quantity, and the more driving water is required. With sufficient driving water and working fall Hydrams will force to any height up to 1,000-ft. (See Testimonial on page 12, for a pair of Hydrams forcing to a height of 719-ft., with a working fall of only 9-ft.). 3. — Distance to be Forced.— Our Hydrams will force to almost any distance, in fact, we would undertake that any of our Hydrams would force to a distance of 10 miles if necessary. We have many Hydrams working with delivery pipes two and three miles long, and in one case 4£ miles (see page 12). 4. — Driving Water.— The quantity of water required to drive a Hydram depends upon the amount of working fall available, the height to raise the water, and the quantity of water it is desired to raise. Our Hydrams can be made to work under favourable conditions with less than half a gallon of water per minute, and nearly all our Hydrams can be adjusted in two or three minutes to work with any quantity of driving water, from their maximum down to less than one-half, a very important feature where springs or streams are apt to vary considerably in volume, according to the season of the year. For example, suppose a spring ordinarily delivers say 30 gallons of water per minute, out of which the Hydram raises say 5,000 gallons of water per day of 24 hours. If then, in a very dry season, the flow of water from the spring drops down to say 15 gallons per minute, the Hydram can be adjusted to work continuously with that quantity, and raise 2,500 gallons per day. In special cases we can supply automatic stopping and starting gear, so that if the flow of water into the feed tank is not sufficient to keep the Hydram going, the Hydram automatically stops working when the feed tank is nearly empty and is re started automatically when the tank has filled up again. But, as a rule, this arrangement is not necessary with our Hydrams, and we prefer to put in a Hydram that can be adjusted to work with the minimum supply. Measuring Driving Water In giving the quantity of water available for working a Hydram, it is quite useless to say “ there is sufficient water to fill a pipe of a certain size, as many correspondents do, unless at the same time you give the length of the pipe and the “ head of water ” on it. because the quantity of water a pipe will deliver entirely depends upon the velocity of the water passing through it. For example, a 3-in. pipe running full would deliver about 15 gallons per minute if the velocity of the water passing through it were at the rate of only 50-ft. per minute, but if the velocity were 200-ft. per minute, then the same pipe “ running full ” would deliver over 60 gallons per minute. Now, unless the driving water is practically unlimited for the purpose required, it is best to make a positive measurement of the water. An easy method of measuring the flow of small springs and streams is to dam up the stream with a little puddle or pieces of turf piled one on the other across the stream, and. in the dam thus made, insert a short piece of earthenware or iron pipe to form a spout, as shown in the sketch on page 29.# I 4 The measurement should then be made by two persons, one to take the time and the other to catch the water. The latter should have, say a 3-gallon bucket, and at the signal from the time keeper he should instantly thrust the bucket under the spout for say, exactly 10, 15, or 30 seconds, taking it away again exactly at the signal of the time-keeper to do so. Then the quantity of water in the bucket should be measured by a pint or quart measure. You can then easily calculate the flow in gallons per minute. If the flow is rather too much to measure in this way, two, three, or more pipes may be inserted in the dam, and when they are all running steadily, each of them should be measured separately. (It is not necessary, of course, that each spout be made to deliver the same quantity.) A flow of 150 to 250 gallons per minute can easily be measured in this way. Measuring Larger Streams If the Hydram required be a large one and the stream be too large to measure in the way indicated above, then a “ weir gauge board ” should be used as shown in sketch on next page. The stream should be dammed up a few inches and on the top of the dam a notchboard thus should be fixed. The notch should be chamfered off to a thin edge, and the width of the notch should be about two-thirds of the width of the stream. # %—. 1 * A peg should be driven into the ground, say three feet back from the board, in the still water, with its top exactly level with the bottom of the notch. (The gauge board should be set perfectly level, and this may be tested and also the level of the peg by observation, just as the water rises to the bottom of the notch). If the width of the notch be then taken and the depth of the water passing over it (as measured from the top of the peg, three feet back to the surface of the water), the discharge in gallons per minute can then be easily calculated from the table below. Discharge of “Weir Boards” In gallons per minute for each foot of width. 4 r Depth, inches. Discharge per ft in width. Gallons per minute. Depth, inches. Discharge per ft. in width.

Water to be Raised.— This should be given in gallons per day of 24 hours, not by stating the size of the pipe it is desired to fill or force through, because, as stated before, the quantity of water a pipe will deliver depends entirely on the “ velocity ” of the water flowing through the pipe. Amount of water required to be raised In calculating the amount of water required for various purposes in the British Isles it is advisable to make allowances at the following rate :— A cottage, about 40 to 50 gallons per 24 hours. A small dwelling-house with, say, 10 inmates, one bathroom, and W.C., and no supply for stable nor garden included, about 300 gallons. Add for each horse and carriage in stable, say, 20 gallons. Add for each Motor Car, say 50 gallons. A small farmstead with, say, 50 head of cattle, about 750 gallons. A large farm with, say, 100 head of cattle and horses, about 1,500 gallons. Add for each head of cattle or horse over 100, 10 gallons. Add for each sheep, 1 gallon. Small country house, stable and garden of average size, about 1,500 to 2,000 gallons. Mansion, stable, and garden, about 3,000 to 5,000 gallons. Village supplies where the water is not taken into the houses, but only to stand pipes, 7 to 10 gallons per head of the population. Village supplies where it is taken into the houses by pipes, 12 to 15 gallons per head. Town Supplies, 25 gallons per head. 6.—Distance in which the Working Fall is Obtained.— Blake’s Hydrams always require a calculated length of drive pipe, according to the conditions of working fall available, and therefore it is advisable to state approximately the distance in which the fall can be obtained. (See sketch on page 27). 7-—“ B ” Hydrams.— “ B ” Hydrams will not draw water from deep wells, in fact we do not recommend them to “ draw ” water from a greater depth than 6 to 10-ft. below the Hydram, though they will force to almost any height above the Hydram. Nor can they be put below the bottom of the working fall to get them nearer to the water to be raised, as they will not work^under water. D r Diagram showing method of fixing a “ B” Hydram. In this case the pure water being above the bottom of the fall, it gravitates by the pipe L, to a small cistern M, close to the Hydram, from which it is pumped up.32 Ascertaining the Working Fall and Height to Force the Water Above the Hydram When it is not convenient to have one of our Surveyors to inspect a site and take accurate levels by Dumpy Level or Theodolite, fairly accurate levels can be taken by means of an ordinary builder’s spirit level and straight-edge, and a few wooden pegs. The straight-edge should be about five to eight feet long with perfectly straight and parallel sides. The diagrams on opposite page show two methods of levelling, the diagram No. I illustrating the method employed on rather flat or slowly falling ground, and No. II on steep ground. METHOD No. I. In this case it is best to level from the top in the direction of down hill, using a staff say exactly 10 feet long. A peg, say 3 feet long is driven into the ground, and a second peg about 5 feet from it to support the other end of the straight-edge. The spirit level is then put on the centre of the straight-edge and the second peg driven down until the straight-edge is exactly level. A penny is then placed on each end of the straight edge for “ sighting points.” An assistant should then take the 10 feet staff in the direction of down-hill, placing the foot of the staff on a stone or peg until a point is found where the top of the staff is exactly level with the line of sight as shown in the diagram No. I. The straight-edge is then moved and set up again over the stone or peg at the foot of the staff and the latter moved another 10 feet down the hill and so on until the whole distance is levelled, all the differences of level from peg to peg being then added together to find the total difference of level from starting point to finish. If the ground is not very steep the horizontal distance from peg to peg may be 70 to 100 yards. Of course the height of the straight-edge above the first peg must be taken at each side and deducted from the 10 feet (or whatever the length of staff used). By careful levelling and sighting in this way, a very accurate result may be obtained. METHOD No. II. This method is used chiefly for levelling only short distances or over very steep ground. A long straight-edge say 12 feet is used, and pegs driven into the ground, say every 12 feet. The difference of level is then taken from peg to peg in the manner shown in the diagram, using a two or three feet rule for ascertaining this difference as the straight-edge is held perfectly level. Method No. II may be used for ascertaining the working fall on a Hydram and No. I for levelling the lift or vertical height to force the water above the position of the Hydram.TESTIMONIALS FOR FARM WATER SUPPLY SCHEMES. £120 per Annum Additional Rental.

Dear Sirs —We have much pleasure in testifying to the excellency of your Hydraulic Rams. During the past 25 years we have put in a number of your Hydrams and they have all given the greatest satisfaction. Now that so much arable land is being laid down to pasture, an ample water supply for stock is essential, and we might mention one instance here where one of your Hydrams was put down in 1919 to supply some farm lands of which the grass keep was being sold by auction every Spring. Before the fields were supplied with water for the stock the grass keep of 120 acres realized under £180 a year, and since drinking troughs were installed in each field the grass keep has averaged just over £300 a year. This Hydram has only stopped once in the seven years it has been working. We put down a pair of your Hydrams some 20 years ago, to supply a country house near here, and when three years ago, an additional supply of water was required we were asked to inspect and report. We visited the site but could not find that any of the estate men even knew the situation of the Hydram house, there being a dense undergrowth in the wood in which it was situated, and when searching for it our assistant stepped on the timber roof of the house and partly fell through. Apparently this pair of Hydrams had been working for at least seven years without having been seen by anyone. Another of your Hydrams which we put in a few years ago to supply water to a farm house and lands, delivered so much more water than was anticipated that the supply was extended to the lands of three other adjoining farms which are all now getting an ample supply. Yours faithfully, SYMES &amp; MADGE. Callow Farm, Dymock, 24th February, 1927. Hydram saves Dear Sirs —I am most pleased with the Hydraulic Ram you £100 per year. supplied and fixed for me in 1920.

During the recent prolonged drought, 1 was probably the only person in Jersey on an elevation amply supplied with water at a pressure. I find the cost of upkeep since 1897 to be 4/- per Hydram per annum, plus a man’s time to turn on and close off.

Dear Sir —I have much pleasure in stating that the Hydram you supplied to Miss Talbot, of Margam Park, last September, has been working ever since most satisfactorily, and so far there has never been a stoppage. I am more particularly pleased, as we have had two Rams previously from two other makers, neither of which gave satisfaction, and although the price of your Hydram was considerably higher than the other Rams which we tried, the result promises to prove that your Hydram will be the cheapest in the end. I have, on the strength of the success of your Hydram, recommended one of Miss Talbot’s tenants to purchase a similar one, and I believe he will probably do so.

Dear Sir— I am very pleased to say that the Hydram you fitted up for me about 25 years ago has given me every satisfaction, and has worked without a single stoppage. This is all the more gratifying, as the Ram I had before from another maker was constantly out of order, and only forced up a small quantity of water, while yours forces up more than is required. Another great advantage of your Hydram is that it works with practically no noise. Yours truly, R. A. MORRIS. 36 IIHydrams for Irrigation Photograph of Hydram supplied for Irrigation in South Africa.

Either Hydram can then be worked alone or both at the same time, and in case one Hydram requires cleaning or adjusting, it can be attended to whilst the other is in operation.NEW STYLE.

EFFICIENT DOMESTIC PUMPING The Lister Domestic Electric Pump meets a pressing need of the country house owner who is not fortunate enough to have his home connected with the main water supply. Hand pumps are, of course, considered inefficient in these days of of simplicity, since, when the level of the water falls below a predetermined pomt, the pump is switched on, replenishing the tank to the normal level, whereupon the current is cut off. The pump can be installed in a small space, and, beyond occasional unskilled attention, it demands practically no care at all. It has a capacity of about 250 gallons per hour, with a vertical suction of 25ft., and a total head of 80ft. The initial cost of the pump, plus £2 3s. for the float-switch, is £16 10s., while the running costs are remarkably low, working out at 1,000 gallons for just under 2d., taking the cost of electricity as Id. per unit. The overall dimensions of the domestic pump are : Length, 1ft. Bin. ; width, 9Jin. ; and height, 1ft. Sin. Messrs. R. A. Lister and Co. have their factory at Dursley, Glos.

GATESHEAD General Fig- 3.—Sigma type VL 3/lll-HD-S “sil-ten.” The Sigma V is a pump of the turbine type. The water is thrown by centrifugal force through the vanes of the guide rings (diffusers) surrounding the periphery of the impellers, and is then guided, by curved channels, towards the centre of the pump, for entry into the impeller of the next stage. This process is repeated throughout the whole length of the pump—through all the impellers (stages). To the pressure of the water received from the first impeller is added the same degree of pressure by the next impeller, and so on, so that the resulting pressure at the discharge flange is the original pressure generated by the first impeller multiplied by the number of impellers (stages) used. The present day design of the Sigma “V” multi- stage pump is backed by 70 years of experience in the manufacture and development of pumping units of all types. These pumps are produced by men who know that trouble free long life and low running costs are the features most sought after by the users of pumping equipment even though it may entail higher initial purchase costs. In the outstanding design of the Sigma “V” it is not only the hydraulic problems which have been so effectively solved, but the mechanical side of its construction has also been thought out in great detail, strength and simplicity being the keynote. The individual stages of the multi-stage Sigma “V” are easily assembled, to the exclusion of any possible leakages, and absolute alignment is secured by the spigots and faucets of the intermediate stages. The balanced proportions of the component parts gives the whole a very harmonious appearance. The quiet hum of the Sigma “V”_ e ven at the highest revolutions—testifies to the perfection of design, and this, combined with the Sigmund high standard of workmanship, makes for long and dependable service. In the manufacture of “Sigma” pumps accuracy and interchangeability are ensured by the use of a strict system of standard gauges and tolerances. The standard Sigma V is built for cold clean water, but can easily be adapted for pumping hot water and also for all processed liquids.

GATESHEAD Specification Casing There are separate suction and delivery chambers (with respective flanges and supporting stands for bolting to the bed plate), and between them— secured by long bolts—are intermediate “stages” casings—in number according to the number of impellers used. Pump casings normally of close grain cast-iron but for abnormal pressures cast steel may be used. Impellers and Diffusers (Guide rings) On standard Sigma “V” pumps, these are of phosphor-bronze and/or gun-metal respectively, the outside surfaces being fully machined. The impellers are finely balanced, on a dynamic balancing machine and the well-designed passages in both impellers and guide rings, with their smooth finish, reduce the hydraulic losses to the absolute minimum. The diffusers are firmly fitted to the stage casing, but are easily removable. Shaft This is of high tensile steel, high finish being obtained by precision grinding, and is of ample proportion for the power to be transmitted. Where the shaft comes into contact with the water, it is protected by a removable hard bronze sleeve. Bearings (See text and illustrations on pages 4 and 5). Hydraulic Balance (See page 5). Stuffing Boxes These are completely water-sealed. The glands and neck bushes are of gun-metal, packed with soft graphited cotton packing rings which are easily renewable ; especially free access to the stuffing box bolts is provided. The discharge stuffing box on types intended for very high delivery heads is fully relieved of pressure (see “HD” construction on page 5). Bedplate This is usually of cast-iron, but can also be of fabricated steel construction. In both cases there is a smooth flat surface for the correct alignment of pump and motor or external bearing support (for belt drive). Coupling For motor, and also for some belt drive constructions (see paragraph “Drive”), the coupling is of the flexible type, of proved design and ample propor tions. Direction of Rotation Standard Sigma “V” pumps are supplied for clockwise rotation (as viewed from the discharge end). Anti-clockwise rotation can be arranged when specifically required. Fittings &amp; Accessories Standard Sigma “V” pumps are equipped with :— Priming funnel, with valve. Air cocks and drain plugs (on intermediate stages). Suction and delivery counter-flanges up to 2£' (all flanges to British Standard Specification). When required, any additional accessories can be supplied, such as strainers, sluice valves, taper pieces, vacuum and pressure gauges, holding-down bolts, etc. Let u s help FIG. 4.

The bearing cover is bolted to the pump casing, absolute alignment being secured by spigots and recesses. From the point of view of bearing location and hydraulic balance, there are three distinct classes of Sigma “V” pumps, denoted by the letters K, D and HD. Fig- 5.—Cross Section of Sigma type VL 2/IV-K-S, showing ‘K’ bearing arrangement (see also Fig. 2 for “V” pump with ‘K’ bearing). Bearing ‘K’ This is used for the smaller sizes of “V” pumps (and even here only for those with a small number of stages), such as are used for ordinary duties and light working conditions. This provides a pump at a very low initial cost, but still quite suitable for ordinary duties.\' V; % SIGMUND PUMPS (GREAT BRITAIN) LTD . TEAM VALLEY .

The shaft having ball bearings or ring oiled sleeve bearings at both ends. Axial thrust—a factor which demands careful consideration in pumps working against very high pressures—is completely eliminated. A specially designed, well-proportioned balancing disc fully counteracts the axial thrust, as the full pressure from the last impeller is brought to bear on its whole diameter, thus establishing perfect equilibrium. The water overflow from the balancing disc chamber is directed by an external pipe to the suction chamber. The stuffing box in the “HD” construction is relieved of all pressure.

GATESHEAD Sigma “V” for Boiler Feed Pumps The general trend in engineering of replacing reciprocating motion by rotary motion is clearly seen in the application of turbine type centrifugal pumps to boiler feed units. Pumps of the turbine centrifugal type are admirably suited to this work since modern boiler designs, embodying a small ratio of water volume to evaporation capacity, demand sensitive automatic boiler feeding, even against very high pressure. The Sigma “V” Boiler Feed Pump has been designed to fulfil to the letter all the conditions to be met in the boiler house. Some of the outstanding features in design are, special gland and bearing cooling when dealing with very hot water, the elimination of axial thrust by specially designed balancing discs, and in the case of pumps with ten or more stages, a Visual indicator is fitted so that at all times any movement of the pump impellers can be seen. The robust construction of both pump and fittings ensures long life under the most arduous conditions and as the production of all parts of these pumps is governed by a strict system of standard tolerances, spare parts are readily interchangeable. 41SIGMUND PUMPS (GREAT BRITAIN) LTD .

GENERAL. —While the end suction type represents one of the simplest forms of the centrifugal pump, the TANGYE ‘ AR ’ is offered as a thoroughly sound mechanical job, which may be confidently relied on for long dependable service. The ‘ AR ’ is of modern design, constructed of frst-class materials by precision methods to standard gauges, ensuring interchangeability of spare parts. IMPORTANT FEATURES OF DESIGN.— Differing from other pumps of the end suction type, no Neck bush Bearing is used to support the impeller and the inner end of the shaft (the weak point in other end suction Centrifugals, especially when the liquid pumped is not absolutely free from grit). 0 In the TANGYE ‘ AR ’ two widely spaced ball bearings (one a combined radial and thrust type) are used, in conjunction with a stiff shaft to support the impeller independent of any neck bush. 0 Driving pulleys are not overhung, avoiding bending of the shaft and permitting the fitting of loose pulley to an extension of fast pulley boss, without straining the pump bearing and eliminating the need of an outer bearing. 0 A balanced impeller is fitted, practically eliminating end thrust. The pedestal bracket is of substantial construction and suitable design to eliminate the necessity of a separate bedplate. METHOD OF DRIVE — CONVERTIBILITY.— Direct drive from electric motor can be used, or belt on to fast, or fast and loose pulleys, while we specially recommend the modern application of Vee Ropes, permitting simple adjustment of the pump duty, while needing minimum floor space. The pumps are convertible from one form of drive to another without shaft alteration. h IIbsunitnon .CI3TIMI I 71YDMAT DETAIL SPECIFICATION OF STANDARD ‘ AR ’ CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS. VOLUTE CASING.— Of cast iron, with drain and priming plugs. IMPELLER.— Of TANGYE SPECIAL TCI—I cast iron, of hydraulically balanced type to minimise end thrust, keyed to shaft. SHAFT. —The rigid shaft is of mild steel, carried in two widely separated ball bearings. Pumps can be converted from direct to belt drive, or vice versa, without shaft alteration. PEDESTAL : BEARINGS.— The cast iron pump pedestal is of substantial construction and suitable form to eliminate the necessity for a separate bed-plate. One radial and one com bined radial and thrust type ball bearing are fitted, widely separated to carry the shaft independent of any neck bush (see page I). Grease lubrication is ftted for the bearings. STUFFING BOX.— The Stuffing Box is fitted with a lantern ring with water sealing, to prevent air leakage. METHODS OF DRIVE.— The ffexible coupling for direct drive is of the rubber bushed pin type, and the standard fast pulley is mounted on the pump half coupling without shaft alteration. Loose pulley when required is fitted to extension of boss of fast pulley (see page I). SPANNERS— Suitable Spa nners included. ADDITIONAL ITEMS. —When required we can supply as extras : Loose Screwed Connecting Flanges and Bolts ; Combined Bedplate for pump and motor ; Sluice, Check and Foot Valves and Suction Strainer ; Holding-down Bolts ; Taper pieces for suction and delivery. Taper Pieces —to keep overall dimensions of pumps to a miminum, the length of branches has been kept down within reason—taper pipes are frequently recommended to take advantage of the full pump capacity. In this connection it should be borne in mind that branch sizes of a modern pump give no direct indication of capacity. ARRANGEMENTS OF BRANCHES AND DIRECTION OF ROTATION. Standard rotation counter clockwise— looking from driving end —opposite rotation is specially ordered. Vi, Diog rcm |, Dio g rom £, pio d nam 3. Diad ran 4 D&lt;o d rom I.

MEidQhANDlH The electric water pump installed in this Agency about ten years ago to supply water to the Political Agent’s residential quarters had become so worn out and had to be repaired so frequently that it became necessary to request the Bahrain State Engineer's Department last year to instal a new pump and motor. It may be mentioned that during the last two hot weather periods, the water supply stopped for several days at a time to the great inconvenience of the officers concerned. The installation of the new motor and pump has now been completed. 2. The cost of the pump and motor and the installation charges, amounting to Rs.1,629/8/0, vide attached billf, are to be paid now and I should be grateful if the sanction of tho Ministry of Works could be obtained for the settlement of these charges.
