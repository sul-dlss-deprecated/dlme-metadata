The India Office, London •K A (d) The prestige of Ibn Saud in Peninsula Oman is in direct proportion to his strength and ability to harm it. There is no foundation for believing that some of the tribes being so-called Wahabis, they desire the extension to themselves of the Iman^s full temporal authority. The Hanbali sect to which the Dhahirah tribes in a large measure belong, is not, as practised here, essentially different from the k&amp;llkl or 3hafi orthodoxy. Inherited from a time when it took a narrow and fanatical fom and imposed at the point of the sword, it is now whittled down to a moderateness and toleration that make it unrecognisable as &gt;,ahabism. bo -called co-religionists of Ibn Saud, these tribes are inveterate smokers, though as a relic of past proscription, they do not as a rule grow 'the weed' in their own territory. They would not gladly suffer the introduc tion of the rigid tenets of Riyadh. On the other hand Ibn Saud they cannot defy. Hopelessly divided against themselves into the Kinawiyah and Ghafiriyah factions, unable or unwilling to unite or sacrifice separate tribal sovereignty which is the genius of their system, it is only Ibn Saud who in the past hundred years has been able to invade and dominate them under a single authority at Garaimi. They know that it is only he who c*ay desire and is able to do this again. But it is not invasion that they fear which prompts them to pay 'zakat*. This spectacular method, which the first invader, Abdul Aziz the ,*ahabi, used at the beginning of the Nineteenth century is no longer jxecessary. To-day it is the power of letting loose a strong tribe to raid a weaker Dhahirah one and carry off its camels without hope of redress or retaliation that is Ibn/r\ Ibn Saud's etrength. Thus immediately before the arrival of Ibn Saud*s zakat collector, one of the Bani Yas tribes was raided by the Al Murra and lost a hundred and fifty- camels. Payment of zakat to Ibn Baud is therefore a kind of insurance against the raider. It is the wisdom and economy of the present Abdul Azi&lt;i to bring his insidious pressure to bear on a wavering tribe through a strong and loyal neighbour whose interest it is to be ensured the fruits of victory. Mindful of the lessons of the ruthless If intermittent aahabi occupations of the Dhahirah, the people of Peninsula Oman do not belittle the man of Kiyadh who to-day has repeated the exploits of his forerunners, but they do not love him. In reality it is not Ibn Baud himself* whom they desire to propitiate but his viceroy Ibn J&amp;luwi, Governor at Hofuf, whose activities extend to these eastern marches. Under this lighter regime Ibn Saud's influence does not as it did in 1800 penetrate into the Oman Sultanate or even to wadi Jizzi, nor does it reach the Coast as it did at Sharjah in the Eighteen Sixties. Its design seems to be to bring ; the Baduin camel tribes of the Dhahirah - the Minasir, Mizariya', Bani Yas baduin, Na'im, Albu Ghamis, Dhuwuhir, Daru', Awamir, Bani Ka'ab and Bani ^it&amp;b - to acknowledge a nominal degree of subordination and pay zakat without trouble or expense, or military rueasures calculated to rouse their antagonism. Clearly the tribes in close proximity to Hasa e.g. Minasir and Lizariya* are unable to resist, those further removed, the Bani Yas Badu (who also derive strength from their coastal connections), the Na'im, Dhuwahir arid Daru* are in a stronger position, while the Bani Ka'ab and Bani ^itab aresufficiently remote to say »No'. It is the wiidom of Ibn Baud to demand from the first, request from the second, and leave it to the volit- ion/volition of the third* The mauakhi this year f one Kuhaiamad bin Hansur of the Murra’ tribe, collected zakat on the following basis* One dollar on each camel from the ‘huwar* i*e* one year camel upwards. One dollar on e^ch ten head of sheep and &amp; oats. Poor caravaners were exempted and remissions were made to the moneyless Awamir. The Darn* paid very little and the Bani Ka'ab and Bani &lt;&lt;itab not at all. But behind the zakat collections, the power of Ibn Baud to turn one of these tribes within his influence on to another, its possibly hereditary enemy, and the fear felt within a tribe of its being left in isolation, give him an undeniable prestige* ..hen these facts are realised the volte face of bhaikh Saqar after promising you support for the Royal Air Force Expedition (Ibn Jaluwi is inwardly not on good terms with him) and t/ie initial tarx or of Shaikh Salim of the Bani Ka’ab to harbour the Royal Air Force party i will appear to be acts of self-preservation and give the observer pause before condemning* DHAHI&amp;vT ) Thus the situation in Jau, or the Baduin northern AL SIR * ) — half of the Dhahirah. The southern half of Dhahirah starting at Shank is called ,I«. Its inhabitants are chiefly settled and mainly belong to the Ghafiriyah faction and the Ibadhi sect* Ibn Saud has made no overtures here and his agent would be unwelcome in aiy of its chief towns Ibri, Sulaif, a1 Araqi, Ainan or Dariz • It will be remembered that in December 1925 the Imam of Interior Oman, and shaikh Isa bin Salih invaded and overran Dahirat al Sir. Ostensibly their object was to resist Wanabi encroachments which were believed to threaten Oman Proper itself* When their/-4- mM their move was seen however to involve worse implications, namely the subordination of Sir, predominantly Ghafiriyah, to a Kinawiyah hegemony, misunaerstandings arose and the army melted away* Sulai^an bin Karayar, Ghafiriyah, defected at the instigation of his co-factionists on the opposition side, and the Imam and Isa were obliged to abandon the edition. Biraimi and Dhahirat at Jau generally, Kanabi in sect and Ghafiriyah in politics, would never tolerate the extension of iianawiyah and Ibadhi influence into Jhahirat al Sir. In the event of a «ahabi invasion in strength I opine that Dhahirat al Sir would i allow the lead of Dhahirat al Jau, which must submit. aut spasmodic zakat collections alone, which represents the present measure of Ibn Saud’s interference in the Dhahirah, will not suffice to draw Dhahirat al Sir to his allegiance. ^ach small settlement prefers its independence, inclining in times of trouble to some historical local alliance.

Tribe / s®It is understood that the Royal Air Force officers are recommending the route Auhi - Mahadhah - Abu Dhabi instead of Sahar - Biraimi - Abu Dhabi which is a longer distance and lies to the south (see map). Tribal opposition to the air route falls into two categories (a) coastal (b) interior. The coastal tribes’ opposition will in the face of our sea-power break down the moment that it is decided (i) that the Air Route must happen (ii) that co-operation to this end will materially benefit them and that obstruction will materially harm them. Their recent action, calculated to induce us to despair of the obstacles and abandon the project, is the only card they have to play. If and when they see that they have to concede they will concede gracefully. Interior tribal opposition is not so easy. It is bound up with the Ibn Sa’ud question. Ibn Saud^ nebulous position in the Dhahirah will have to crystallise before the ^aduin tribes can be expected to take a definite line. The question of whether Imperial Air Route interests will best be served by (u) Government recognition of Ibn Baud’s position in ieninsula Oman, or (b) Ibn Baud’s entire exclusion therefrom, does not come within my purview. But it can be stated definitely that his present hall' and naif position there militates against any of the interior tribes co-operat ing with us. They do not know where they stand. In this connection it would seem that as Ibn Baud can already collect ^akat by moral force the present indeterminate position suits him. His own interests do not require his risking tribal opposition by an attempt to obtain complete sovereignty over the area. This has an important bearing on wiiat 1 presumeto be the vital position along the hir Route f namely the hall way landing ground at I^ahadhah in Bani Ka’ab country. I tentatively sounded Bhailch Salim about the Royal Air l orce using this place as a landing ground. He said he was friendly disposed but pointed out the difficulties. (i) the Ibn Saud question, and his own fear that he will fall between two stools. (ii) he could never agree to foreign troops being quartered there, or to buildings, or any action which would discredit him in the eyes of the Arabs. (iii) he could never agree to L.ahadhah being used in operations against Arab tribes. I pointed out that these views were oased upon a misconception of the objects we sought. As regards the first point, Shaikh Salim's opinions deserve attention. His support of the Royal hir Force party when other Dhahirah tribes were rallying to Ibn Baud's Agent is not likely to have endeared him to Ibn Saud: his opposition to Ibn Baud's claims in the Dhahirah are well known: to allow Bani ha'&amp;b territory to be used by our aero planes is calculated to estrange Ibn Saud still further and result in his being raided by Dhahirah trioes acting under instructions. In such circumstances he must walk warily. If, he asks, as a result of satisfying our Air demands he exposes himself to these risks will Ire afford him assistance or protection in certain eventualities ? Shaikh Salim ueiore he is able to agree to our proposals will therefore want to &amp;now how he stands vis k vis Ibn Saud. If he is satisfied on this point he said he is disposed to agree. Should the Trans-Oman Air Route be decided upon 1 suggest the following monthly subsidies to tribal Shaikhs• Rs. 100 Shaikh Salim bin Diyan (and &amp;a»adhid) for rent 01 landing/1 Ii8 • lana pg ground at Kiahadhah and protection throughout J ani Ka*ab territory* 30 shaikh ivhmad bin Abdullah for rent of landing ground at Auhi. 30 Shaikh Salim bin Abdullah for protection in southern half of ^adi Jiszi. 30 Shaikh Haxndan bin Khiilfan for protection in northern half of */adi Jlzzi. Between Mahadhah and Abu Jhabi it roiy be advisable to subsidise - in conjunction with Abu Shabi - one of the Bcdii Yas Baduin sections 30 Hs. per mensem for protection in case of forced landings in that area. Over and above this an occasional douceur of Hs.60/- to the Awamir and other Baduin who wander into this area would appear to be advisable. The total cost of this would be about Hs.3,0j0/- per annum.CONFIDENTIAL. bMi No# 1054-S of 1934.

Mr. Thomas was informed confidentially of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Blue Line and the general position was discussed with him. It was agreed thc^t steps should he taken to obtain a report written by him on the air route reconnaissance of 1927 from the Gulf and he kindly consented to answer a questionnaire to be compiled after that report had been seen if we should so desire. His views on the following points of general interest were as follows. 2* Desirability and practicability of fixed bounda r ies . Mr. Thomas, in the light ofhis experience of Arabia saw very strong objection to laying down fixed boundaries as represented by a line on the map in the hinterland of the Trucial Shaikhdoms, Muscat, etc. Such a line was meaningless so far as tribes and local rulers were concerned. The tribal boundary was the only real one. Moreover, the situation in the hinterland was essentially fluid and a line which might represent the position at the moment would be unlikely to do so, say, in ten years' time, even if the general political situation remained the same, and certainly would not do so once any major political alteration (such as the death of Ibn Baud, the death of Ibn Jiluwi, or the reassertion of the influence of Abu Dhabi) had taken place. 3• Possibility of settlement on a tribal basis . While a tribal basis was likely to be very much more satisfactory than a territorial basis, Mr.Thomas saw great difficulty in a settlement of this nature. He admitted that it might be possible to earmark settled elements of particular tribes such as the Manasir and to separate them from the nomad elements /- 2 - / O elements for the purpose of a tribal settlement. But he repeat ed that tribal allegiances were very light and varied very rapidly, that the area of the dira or circle within which a tribe operated mi 6 ht well be affected by failure of grass, etc., and that individual Shaikhs were not necessarily in a position to pledge their tribes to a certain allegiance. «Yhat had ^n practice in the past determined Tribal allegiances had been the wealth, the personality and the pov/er to bring pressure of the more important rulers at any given time, whether in Nejd, in Muscat, or in Abu Dhabi, and he thought we should oe incurring great risks if at this stage we entered into any written statement with Ibn Baud which attributed certain tribes to him. Incidentally the Manasir were historically an Abu Dhabi tribe, although in the last five or six years they had paid Zakat to Ibn Saud. 4• Ibn Saud *5 influence to t he east of the Blue Line and the payment of Zakat . Mr. Thomas in the first place confirmed a suggestion already made from the Gull that zakat represented no more than a mild form of insurance carrying with it no suggestion of suzerainty or sovereignty and corresponding closely to the ancient danegeld. It would be dangerous in his view to base any settlement merely on the fact that zakat had oeen paid by a particular tribe at any given time. What in practice happened was that a tribe which found itself engaged in hostilities with another neighbouring tribe, which, like itself, had not paid zakat to, say, Ibn Saud, seized the opportunity, by sending a camel or some small similiar tribute to Ibn Saud to secure his moral support in any raiding which it might undertake. The danger and the occasion ovei , the payment of zakat would lapse. Or again, nomad tribes might tender an offering to _ibn Saud, or to j-bn tTiluv^i, ii they found themselves in the course of their wanderings ne-^r the /the borders of Nejd or close to some area in which Saudi influence was strong. They certainly would not regard them selves as committed to any permanent allegiance to Ibn Saud by such a payment. Or again, a member of the shaikhly family, who had designs on the ruling Shaikh, or who found himself threatened by that shaikh, would send a present to Ibn Juluwi, by way of strengthening his hands against his own ruler. 5• Influence of Ibn Jiluwi . Mr. Thomas was of opinion that the influence of Ibn Jiluwi was the most substantial feature of the Saudi regime in north-eastern Arabia. Ibn Jiluwi’s strongly marked personality, his strength, and his severity had acquired a great influence for him among the Bedouin. In Mr. Thomas' opinion the influence of the Saudi Government in the hinter land of the area to the east of the Blue Line was likely to be very substantially reduced with Ibn Jiluwi’s death. Ibn Saud, unless he could find an equally dominating lieutenant, would not himself be in a position to carry anything like so much weight. 6. The r e ligious c o nflic t. Mr.Thomas said that there was no question of the Ibadhi tribes of Oman being willing to accept Saudi overlord ship or enter into relations with Ibn Saud. They were definitely and positively hostile on religious grounds and would certainly be opposed to any Saudi attempt to absorb them. This was true to a less extent of the Shafi tribes, which might or might not be prepared in certain circumstances to support or pay zakat to Ibn Saud. Baraimi. The tribes of Baraimi. while one section of them, 7-4- the El Shamis, had paid zakat to Ibn Saud, would certainly strongly resent any endeavour on his part to exercise effective control over them. In this connection Mr.Thomas referred to the great importance up to recently of Abu Dhabi, a shaikhdom which had for very many years been the post powerful in the Persian Gulf. 8. as regards the boundaries of Muscat , the position was that it was difficult, if not impossible, to set out their specific limit in the hinterland. The Imam and the Ibadhi tribes were for practical purposes, though not formally, inde pendent of the Sultan. For religious reasons they would, however be likely to be equally hostile to Ibn Saud. In the south-east, in Dhofar, there had never been any question of Saudi influence. Ibn Saud had sent emissaries to the Saar, Manahil, etc. But these tribes r together with the El Kathiri and the Lahra tribes of the southern steppe, did not pay zakat to Ibn Saud and had rejected overtures made to them by emissaries sent to them by the King. The tribes which used the sands did pay zakat to Ibn i Saud in a loose sort of way, but it wouldbe dangerous to base too much on this• Id. «J. G. L. 19.10.34. India Office.wmmmmmmm % ■i CONFIDENTIAL.

(£6769/279/91) Foreign Office,S.W.l. 7th November,1934 . My dear Gilbert, With reference to your letter P.Z.6810/34 of the 5th November, enclosing a note of Bertram Thomas's views on the south-eastern Arabian frontiers question, and to our various recent conversations on the subject, I write, as arranged, to put on record the very tentative suggestion which I mention ed to you for a possible solution of this problem on new lines in the light of the further information now available. 2. The most important new feature in the situation seems to me to be the point which Thomas brought out in his talk with us on the 31st October about the extremely shifting and temporary character of tribal allegiances in this area, and the probable impermanence of any overloraship v/hich may at any one moment be exercised over the desert tribes by whoever happens at the time to be the most powerful of the neighbouring Arabian rulers. If Thomas is right in stressing this point to the extent he does, it is perhaps more important than we at first thought that we should avoid tying our hands by any premature recognition of Saudi territorial sovereignty over a wide area over which it may no longer extend in practice when Ibn Saud dies and his personal prestige begins to be forgotten. Indeed it seems possible, from some of Thomas's remarks recorded in the note enclosed in your letter, that Saudi influence over some of the northern tribes in the desert area may wane even before Ibn Saud’s death, if Ibn Jiluwi, whose personal prestige has apparently done so much to bring these tribes within Ibn Saud's sphere, were to disappear. 3. The main object of my tentative suggestion would be to try / J.G.Laithwaite Esquire- 2 - try to meet this difficulty by the creation of a special 'desert zone' 5 within which it would still be possible lor Ibn Saud to maintain his present loose overlordship over the tribesj but in respect of which the various ^arties concerned should, by a kind of mutual self-denyiiig ordinance 9 renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the granting ol concessions, the establishment of permanent fortifications etc. It would not be a 'neutral H zone with so-caxled 'equal rights 1 , nor a mere 'no man’s land' where there would be no rights at all, but an area - rather like a maritime zone - where rights would be personal and not territorial. It would have to be subject to a special desert regime, which could I think be so devised as to enable Ibn Saud to maintain any personal rights which he does at present effectively exercise over the nomadic tribes - e.g. the right to levy a certain amount of zikat (either as tribute or as insurance) in the loose and rather undefined way wrich Thomas has described to us, etc. But at the same time it would preclude Ibn Saud - or for that matter ourselves acting for any of our prbteg&amp;s - from giving any oil or other concession implying territorial sovereignty, or irom establishing permanent territorial claims to the area in question. 4. Of course the main difficulty of any such suggestion will be to get Ibn Saud to accept it. On the other hand the present position is that we have taken our stand on the 'Blue Line' and do not admit that Ibn Saud possesses any rights whatever to the east of it. We have offered him a small modiiication of the 'Blue Line' but he apparently claims the entire desert up to the coastal belt. We could not possibly, I think, - particularly in the light of what Thomas has told us about the shifting character /character of tribal allegiance in this area - agree to recognise Ibn Sauces full territorial sovereignty over so large an area; and it seems to me that it is just possible that some arrangement on the lines I am now suggesting, by which Ibn Saud might be enabled to maintain a kind of loose personal sovereignty over the tribes over the whole of the desert without acquiring any territorial rights, might offer the means of reaching some compromise between the position on which we have at present taken our stand and his own extravagant claims. 5. My idea is that this ’’desert area” should be circumscribed by a kind of 'ring fence' consisting of the boundaries of the areas over which the surrounding rulers can be reasonably represented as having claims to exclusive territorial sovereignty. I would suggest that this 'ring fence” line should be drawn in such a way as to give the maximum possible amount of territory to the Trucial Shaikhs, the Sultanate of Muscat^and the Aden Protectorate. This would enable us to have a wide margin for purposes of any necessary defence measures - e.g. pursuit by the Royal Air Force of fugitive raiders, etc. One of our m&amp;in objects would of course be to secure a complete renunciation by Ibn Saud of any claims of any description over the area to the seaward side of that line where it would bound the territories of our pr6teg£s. 6. The rough framev/ork of the kind of agreement I have in mind would be somewhat on the following lines:- The Contract ing parties, 'with a view to resolving certain difficulties which have arisen in connexion with territorial boundaries in south-eastern Arabia,' would agree as follows: A special 'desert area', subject to a special desert regime, shall be created, the boundaries of whic^h shall oe as follows (These lines /-4- lines are merely tentative suggestions to serve as basis for discussion): On the west, a line starting from the head of the Dohat-es-Salwa and running due south to parallel 19, and thence in a west south-westerly direction to the eastern boundary of Nejran. 7. On the east by a line running from the same point on the Dohat-es-Salwa in a south-easterly direction to the western corner of the Sabkhat-al-nmra salt lake (Just west of the Khor-e1-Odeid), as shown on such-and-such a map. Thence due south to the well of Baniyan (the well itself could be on one side of the line or on the other, according to what seemed most suitable), as shown on such-and-such a map, where it appears on the intersection of Meridian 51 and Parallel 23 (as shown on that map). Thence in an east-south easterly direction to the true intersection of keridan 55 and Parallel 22. Thence due south to the true intereection of keridlan 55 and Parallel 20. Thence in a west-south westerly direction following the edge of the limit ot the sand dunes of the Ruba-el-Kali desert (which is well marked), as shown on such-and-such a map, to a point so many miles due north of Tarim in the tfadi Hadramaut. Thence in a north westerly direction (see below) until it rejoins the westerly limit described above. 8. Ibn Saud would then undertake (in whatever form such an undertaking could be made most palatable to him) to put for ward no claims of any description whatever to tne areas to the east and south of the line described in paragraph 7 aoove from the head of the Dohat-es-Salwa to such-and-such a point (e.g. where it crosses the so-carled violet line) and His Majesty's Government for their part, and on behali of their pr6teg£s, would undertake to put forward no claims to the area to the west of the line described in paragraph 6 above. Special /-5- Special provision might have to he made ior the sector 01 the line between Nejran and the so-called violet line, where it may march with the Yemen. 9. Within the ‘'desert area' none of the parties to the convention would possess any exclusive territorial rights, and in particular they would undertake to reirain from granting any concessions and from establishing any permanent fortifi cations. They would also undertake not to raise objection to the passage over this area of each other s airciait. but a system of loose overlordship might perhaps oe described which would recognise Ibn Saud's present de facto rights. The Contracting Parties would further agree that the special regime set up for the 'desert area' should in the first instance last for a period of, say, twenty years only, and that at the expiration of that period it would be subject to reconsideration at the instance of any of the Parties con cerned. .lQ. This is an extremely rough and tentative outline of the sort of thing I have in mind, and I recognise that the luller information which we are awaiting from the Gulf may materially alter the position. Moreover I have not yet had time to consult undrew rtyan about it, and he may see serious objections to it which have not yet occurred to me. In any case there are obvious difficulties e,en as regards the mere definition of the boundaries let alone the definition of the r&amp;gime itself. 11. It is also for consideration whether we should not try to include a much larger area to the west of the brue and purple lines within the 'desert area'. This would, I think, be in accordance with the actual facts of the situation, and would make a tidier job of the whole thing from the purely geographical point of view. It seldom pays to disregard. geographical factors* At the same time Ibn baud will presumably /presumably object to giving away his full territorial sovereignty over anything to the west oi the blue and violet lines, articularly as it a^pe^rs from rhilby's map that he does in fact exercise a fairly definite territorial sovereignty as far to the south east as the parallelogram bounded on the north and south by parallels 22 and 19 respectively, and on the east and west by meridians 50 and 52, These, however, are points of detail which can be considered if and when we find that the general principle of a special desert area subject to the kind of regime which 1 have indicated, is worth pursuing* 12. My chief fear is that Ibn Saud is likely to make great difficulties over abandoning his claims to territorial rights over any area even to the east of the blue and violet 1 -i.nes* But it is just possible that, if it were only by some arrange ment of this kind that he could secure our acceptance of his claim to personal overlordship over all the tribes of the desert area, he might be persuaded to agree. 13.

Thomas was informeci confiaentially of tho difficulties which have arisen in connection witn the Blue Line ana the general position was discussed with him. It was agreed that steps shoula he taken to obtain a report written by him on tne air route reconnaissance of 1927 from the Gulf ana he kinuly consented to answer a 4 uestionnaire to be compiled after that report had been seen if we should so aesire. His views on the following points of general interest were as follows. 2. Desirability ana practicability of fixed bounaaries. kr. Thomas, in the li &amp; ht of his experience of Arabia saw very strong objection to laying down fixed boundaries as represented by a line on the map in the hinterlana of the Trucial sheikhaoms, muscat, etc. Such a line was meaningless so far as tribes and local rulers were concerned. The tribal boundary was tne only real one. Ivbreover, the situation in the hinterland was essentially fluia ana a line which might represent the position at the moment woula be unlikely to ao so, say, in ten years’ time, even if the general political situation remained the sane, ana certainly woula not ao so once any major political alteration (such as the death of Ibn 3aud, the death of Ibn Jiluwi, or the reassertion of the influence of Abu Dhabi) had taken place. 3/3. Possibility of settlement on a tri b al basis . While a tribal basis was likely to be very much more satisfactory than a territorial basis, Mr. Thomas saw great difficulty in a settlement of this nature. He admitted that it might be possible to earmark settled elements of particular tribes such as the Manasir and to separate them from the nomad elements ior the purpose of a tribal settlement. But he repeated that tribal allegiances were very light and varied very rapidly, that the area of the dira or circle within which a tribe operated might well be affected by failure of grass, etc., and that individual Shaikhs were not necessarily in a position to pledge their tribes to a certain allegiance. rolitical prestige in these areas was largely a matter of wealth and patronage, and Kuwait, nbu Dhabi, Nejd and Muscat had in the past exercised an influence the extent of which had varied largely from time to time according to their economic position and their power to extend patronage. ll e thought we should be incurring great risks if at this stage we entered into any written settlement with Ibn Saud which attributed certain tribes to him. Incidentally the ^-anasir were historically an nbu Dhabi tribe, although in the last five or six years they had paid zakat to j -bn Saud. 4. Ibn Saud's influence to the east of the Blue Line and the payment of zakat. Mr.Thomas in the first place confirmed a suggestion already made from the Gulf that aakat represented no more than a mild form of insurance carrying- with it no suggestion of suzerainty or sovereignty and corresponding closely to the ancient danegeld. It would be dangerous in nis view to base any /any settlement merely on the fact that zakat h&amp;a been paid hy a particular tribe at any given time. What in practice happened was that a tribe which founa itself engaged in hostilities with another neighbouring tribe, which, like itself, haa not paid zakat to, say, Ibn 3aud, seized the opportunity, by sending a camel or some small similar tribute to Ibn 3aua to secure his moral support in any raiding which it might undertake. The danger ana the occasion over, the payment of zakat woula lapse. Or again, nomad tribes might tender an offering to Ibn Saua, or to Ibn Jiiuwi, if they found themselves in trie course of their wanderings near the borders of Nejd or close to some area in which Sauai influence was strong. They certainly woula not regard themselves as committed to any permanent allegiance to Ibn 3aud by such a payment. Or again, a member of the sheikhly family, who had designs on the ruling sheikh, or who found himself threatened by that sheikh, would send a present to Ibn Jiiuwi by way of strengthening his hands against his own ruler. 5. Influence of Ton Jiiuwi . klr. Thomas was of opinion that the influence of Ion Jiiuwi was the most substantial feature of the Sauai regime in north-eastern nrabia. Ibn Jiluwi's strongly marked personality, his strength, ana his severity had acquired a great influence for him among the Beaouin. In klr. Thomas' opinion the influence of the Saudi Government in the hinterland of the area to trie east of the Blue Line was likely to be very substantially reduced with Ibn Jiluwi's death. Ton saua, unless he could fina an equally dominating lieutenant, would not himself be in a position to carry anything like so much weight. The/4 6. The religious conilict . Mr. Thomas said that there was no question of the roadhi tribes of Oman being willing to accept 3auai overlordship or enter into relations with Ibn Sana. They were definitely ana positively hostile on religious grounds and would certainly be opposed to any 3a.uai attempt to absorb them. 7 . This was true to a less extent of the Bhafi tribes, which might or might not be prepared in certain circumstances to support or pay zakat to Ibn Baud. Baraim!. 8# The tribes of Baraimi, while one section of bu them, the a! ^Snamis, had paid zakat to Ibn 3aud, woula certainly strongly resent any endeavour on his part to exercise effective control over them. In this connection hr. Thomas referred to tne great importance up to recently of Abu Dhabi, a sheikhdom which had for very many years been tne most powerful in the Persian Gulf, (compare his remarks in para .3 above). 9. As regards the boundaries of Muscat , the position was that it was difficult, if not impossible, to set out their specific limit in the hinterland. The Imam ana tne Ibadhi tribes were for practical purposes, though not formally, independent of the sultan. For religious reasons they would, however, be likely to be equally hostile to Ibn Baud. In the south-east, in Dhofar, there had never been any question of Saudi influence. Ibn 3aud had sent emissaries to the Saar, Manahil, etc. But these tribes, together with the SI Katniri and the Mahra tribes of the southern steppe, did not pay zakat to Ibn Saua and had rejected overtures made/5 3 made to them hy emissaries sent to them hy the King. The tribes which used the sands aid pay zakat to Ibn Saud in a loose sort of way, but it would be dangerous to base too much on this. J.G.L. 19.10.34. INDIA OFF I Cl ♦Thomas Arabia Felix,281.

H.M.'s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London. No.23. Government of India, New Delhi. No.13. Political Resident, Bushire No.20. Dated 9th (received 11th) February 1935. My telegram No.7. In further conversation on February 7th Fuad conveyed in studiously disarming language King's views that it woikld be preferable not to make outstanding questions subject of general negotiations but to deal with each on its merits as in the past. When conversations from which present proposal had emerged were begun last June King that he could not co-ordinate general policy. His Majesty's Government had diverted course of discussion to sett-Lement of outstand ng questions. His Majesty feared that il such questions were dealt with by way of general negotiations and these failed their result would be dangerously misinterpreted • 2. After some discussion of this communication in which I took no strong line but was mildly critical, Fuad turned to question of Eastern frontiers. He asked to what form settlement of it would take. Would local Arab Rulers be in any way parties to discussion of it ? He asoured me that Ibn Baud had no desire to interfere between His Majesty's Government and those Rulers but said that King must consider Moslem and Arab opinion and must avoid any appearance ol dis regarding their position as Arabs . 3 . I replied that His Majesty's Government had never approached matter otherwise than as a question ol determining boundaries between Saudi Arabia and an area with which they and local Rulers were alone concerned. I stressed fact that latter /- 2 - latter had placed 'themselves in our hands as regards foreign relations• 4. Fuad said that opinion which King had in mind was very ill-informed. He suggested that settlement would be easier if Rulers could be represented in some way by experts or if they would affirm their desire to be represented by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In view of new turn given to whole matter by Fuad's communication I refrained from pressing him for precise state ment regarding Ibn Baud's desiderata for which I had asked on January 21st. 6 . I promised Fuad a communication about Kuwait but deferred it until I could study your telegram No.23 with previous correspondence. I said that I was awaiting instruc tions about agent for proposed local conference at Bahrain. We visualised on other questions including that of Trans jordanian frontier but only incidentally. j 7. My own view is that proposal regarding negotiations cannot usefully be pursued any further. I do not consider now that any of the concessions contemplated in paragraphs 8 to 10 of your telegram No .8 would attract Ibn Saud sufficiently to induce him to give us satisfaction onour questions for the sake of such concessions . On the other hand Fuad was so profuse in assurances of Kir^g settling all questions as to suggest that His Majesty is nervous. $ This may independent settlement with tribes of Kuwait and possibly other matters. 8 . Cconcession contemplated in your telegram No .8 were intended to form comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions. If these are to be dealt with separate ly question arises whether His Majesty's Government are still j.re^ared to of. er them. There can be no settlement if they simply /A -3- '&lt;S) simply fall back on Anglo-Turkish Conventions. Difficulty of settlement on any basis whatever is greatly increased by intro duction of Arab nation factor. I have explained importance of this in my despatches Nos.17 and No.28 which should re^ch you about 11th and 18th February. Its is enhanced by moderation of Fuad’s language under King’s instructions on February 7th as compared with his private expression of his own sentiments on January 20th. 9. You may prefer to shelve question. If so, I can play for stalemate but this presents disadvantage that Ibn Saud will be left with a sense of grievance and as to future attitude of His Majesty's Government. Alternative is, in my opinion, to follow out in your telegram No .8 and to work simultaneously but independently for termination of Kuwait blockade which is next most important outstanding question. 10. We must however be prepared for rejection tff all proposed concessions not merely because of greatest of Ibn Baud's pretensions but because of his acceptance of principle that he must base his action to some extent on Arab nationalist view. I have been speculating very tentatively as to possibility of a shheme based on that of i.e. that His Majesty's Government is an agreement between Ibn Saud Sultan of Muscat and Oman and themselves representing all Rulers from M 0 &amp;alla to ^)atar with express consent of those Rulers on lines of general : a. all parties to recognise each others independence. b. all parties to recognise for a period existance of a positive zone in which none would exer cise any rights of territorial sovereignty. 11. This solution may be completely impossible. I cannot say that it would be acceptable to Ibn Saud. In any case /case it would obviously require long preparation and possibly some sort of a conference to detine the desert zone and to elaborate other details. Nevertheless I think it is worth examining. 12. I am sending full record of conversation by bag. -RYhN-Telegram From xx London• To H.M.'s Minister, Jedda. No.29. Repeated Government of India, New Delhi. No.21. Political Resident, Bushire. No.11 Dated 15th February 1935. (Relayed under Bushire telegram No.205, dated the 20th February 1935). Your telegram No.23* I have no objection to your reverting to separate simultaneous settlement of outstanding points as suggested in paragraph 9 of your telegram. In that case however you will no doubt consider the possibility of following up suggestion you ^ourself made at the end of Middle East official Sub-C’ommittee Meeting of November Sth, that discussion of Kuwait Blockade question should be taken first. 2. Paragraph 2 your telegram. It is, I suppose, possible that Ibn Saud allow Fuad his head in order to see how much he can extract from His Majesty’s Government but that if Kis Majesty’s Government reacted violently Ibn Saud will tighten rein. In any case it must be made clear to Saudi Government once for all that His Majesty’s Govern ment will not abandon their established policy in the Persian Gulf in order that Ibn Saud may play with greater effect to pan-Arab gallery of whose intelligence they hold same estimate as Fuad. If king seriously intends to press this point, negotiations on frontier question affecting Anglo- Saudi relations as a whole will arise. It is therefore essential to disabuse Fuad on this point without delay. 3. I approve generally of your language to Fuad on this question. His queries recorded in paragraph 4 mut. of /of enclosure in your despatch No.i7 were ?impertinent &gt; If he should again allude to promise given to Hussein (I assume he refers to McMahon ? 1916-17 correspondence) short answer is that in that correspondence His Majesty’s Government expressly reserved their rights under their treaties with Arab Rulers of the i-ersian Gulf. These treaties have been ofiicially communicated to Saudi Government* 4. While speaking generally in above sense with whatever degree of firmness you consider g necessary to drive home main points, namely refusal of His Majesty’s Government to be exploited in pan-Arab interests you may see fit to add that for their own part, as Ibn Saud is aware, His Majesty’s Government have constantly been at pains to prom6te good relations between Arab States. It is for this reason that they attach particular importance to question of Kuwait Blockade, settlement of which they ho^e to negotiate with Saudi Government even if general negotiations are abandoned. 5. Scheme for general agreement proposed in parggr^ph 10 of your telegram under reference is being considered in connection with your despatch No.28 on which I hope to address you shortly.

A possible modification might be from Baniyan to intersection of meridian 66 and parallel 22 and thence as proposed by Ibn Baud. This would not encroach on Oman territory between parallels 22 and 20 and I do not think it will encroach on Muscat territory further South to the North of Dhofar. We can await further developments.

Dated 10th (received 11th) April 1935. My telegram No.84. Although Ibn Saud's territorial demands are very extensive he is showing many signs of present anxiety to settle outstanding questions generally. It may be advisable to take advantage of this and expedite further discussion of frontier question rather than adhere to policy laid down in your telegram No.33. For one thing it is desirable to make as much progress as possible before Fuad leaves next month. 2. I gave Fuad yesterday Memorandum confirming offer mentioned in penultimate paragraph of my telegram under reference. Only value of this is to show conservative character of His Majesty’s Government’s approach. It cannot be mut ♦ I have mentioned oil consideration but I do not think Saudi Government know much about it or attach any-thing like as much importance to economic considerations as to extension of influence in desert. 3. I should now be disposed to proceed quickly Mut. muL. contemplated in paragraph 9 of your telegram No»8 and suggest desert zone should be recognised for ten years for which Saudi Government wish to prolong Treaty of Jedda. Inducement might be held out that while territories adjoining limits of zones would accrue respectively /—2— (Gt) respectively to nrab rulers not one would be committed as regards zone itself and there would be time for completion of study of tribal considerations before end of ten years. 4 . I suggested zone should be defined as in correspondence ending with your telegram No .55. If desert zone solution is agreed further limitation proposed in Aden telegram No.19 seems to me unnecessary as Kadramaut tribes would have same access to zone as others. 5. It would be necessary to indicate at very early stage principles of regime proposed for zone. I suggest following: (a) All questions of sovereignty to remain in abeyance as between rulers concerned. (b) Rulers to have access to zone to control tribes normally frequenting areas under their sovereignty.

Aden telegram No.11 to Colonial Office shows that any new boundary cutting the Violet Lire should not do so south of parallel 18. It also now appears most desiraole - see Aden Despatch No.42 to Colonial Office copy to you by bag No.59 that Northern boundary of Aden Protectorate north oi Hadramaut should run at least 20 miles north of southern edge of Great Sands (so as to leave strip of desert within Protectorate) and not along edge itseli as suggested in paragraph 7 of Rendelis letter of 7th November to Laithwaite and subsequent correspondence. It appears that this object could be achieved and a clear and reasonable boundary secured if Line in this xg area whether as marking Southern boundary desert zone or for purposes of paragraphs 9 and 10 of my telegram No.8 were (instead of following edge of sands) to run along parallel IS between its intersection with Violet Line and its intersection with meridian 52. In that event it would probaoly be simpler and better (nothwithstending now familiar objection to delinition by geographical co-ordinates in imperfectly surveyed area) to re-define Eastern and South Eastern boundary of proposed desert zone as follows: “From intersection of parallel 22 noth and meridian 55 east, down that meridian to its intersection with parallel 20$ thence in a xtax straight line to intersection of meridian 52 with parallel 18$ thence along that parallel - F1 to /- 2 - to its intersection of Violet Line'• Latter need not be to as sucfo but could, be separately defined* Northern terminal of frontier between Aden Protectorate and Sultanate of Muscat and Oman would then be at intersection of meridian 52 and parallel IS* Unless you, Resident Aden or Government of India see serious objection you should adopt this definition in future instead of definitions for these sectors given in my telegrams No.sS and 43*Telegram XX., No.19, datefl 29tn Irecd.SOtli) Jlarch 193&amp;.

The Government of the Gaudi Arao Kingdom consider that the frontier line which divides them and the Amirate of ^atar passes through the following places The said line begins at a point on the coast of the sea known as Bohat Salwa and follows (literally, runs parallel to) a line extending from the junction of Jebel Dukhan and the neighbouring territory in a western direction, leaving the area (literally distance) which is situated on its west and which is located between Jebel Dukhan and Jebel An-Nakhsh to the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and Jebel Dukhan and what is behing it on the «a*c to $atar. The line then turns to the south and the south-east parallel to the slppe of the eastern ^ala*il (? eastern slope of the gala’ll), leaving the Qala*il known as Qalalat Ad-Darb, Mashash As-Samim, Al-Maghdar, At-Ta’z, Um-Samra, Ariq-Mashash Ibn Shafi and the territory situated to the west thereof kno//n as Ariq and ^ala’il to the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and those to the east of this line to Q,atar* The line then extends from Mashash Ibn Shafi to Ai-’Aql as far as the coast of the sea leaving Naqiyan Q,atar to Qatar and the Khor Al-Odeid to the Saudi A r ab Kingdom. 2. The Government of the Saudi Arab Kingdom consider also that the said frontier line which divides them a nd the Arab Amirates and Sheikhdoms situated on the Persian Gulf runs through the following placess- The said line begins at a place on the sea coast 25 kilometres distant from the Khor Al-Odeid and extends to tne south and south east parallel to the lands knows &amp;b Majann, Sabakhat-Matti and Khufat sl-Liwa leaving the lands belonging to Khufat al-Liwa to the Arab Amirates and those to the west to the Saudi Arab Kingd om,Kingd om. S« The said line runs from the limits of the territory of Khufat al-Liwa as faras the intersection of Meridian 56 degrees East with Parallel 22 degrees North and it then follows (literally, runs parallel to) Meridian 56 degrees East as far as the point where it meets Parallel 19 degrees North. It then goes direct until it comes to the intersection of Parallel 17 degrees North with Meridian 52 degrees East and then goes direct in the western direction along (literally parallel to) Parallel 17 degrees North until it cuts the line known as the violet line.P.Z, 2697/35 , (E.2373/77/91).

Question was considered by Fiddle Last Oliicial Sub-Committee on April 15th with following results. 2. When desert zone solution was originally proposed lat November it was anticipated that far larger area would be subject to special desert regime than that now comtemplat- ed* Information since received shows that Southern frontier of any concession to Ibn Haud whether in full sovereignty or in form of a desert zone should not be further south than line starting from intersection of parallel 18 and violet line and running roughly east north east up to and through intersection ox parallel IS and meridian 52 (and if necessary onwards in the same direction - see paragraph 6 below). 3 # There is also little question that iinal concession contemplated in my telegram No .8 i.e. area (south of Baniiyan) up to meridian 52 in full sovereignty will have to be made in the end. This would 1 anther reduce proposed desert zone to a trapezoid between men .. s 52 and 55. 4. Sub-Committee consider that in these eireurnstauces complicated desert zone regime which might have been suitable / Isuitable for large area originally in question is too elaborate a solution for this very reduced and inaccessible area. They think that it will be better not to attempt possible difficult task of working out its details and of imposing it on I bn Saud and to atiandon the whole idea of desdrt to zones or of special servitudes in this area proceeding^direct offer of farther limited concessions in full sovereignty by one or possibly two stages. 6. First and second stage contemplated in my telegram No .a l.e. definition of Ibn Saud's claims and offer of our opening concession have now been concluded and next stage will presumably open with Saudi reply to your offer of so- called “green line 1 * (see your telegram No.84 paragraph 6). If as you anticipate this offer is rejected as entirely insufficient you are now authorised to offer Ibn Saud in lull sovereignty arki without any servitudes further area enclosed by line running from a point on Green Line to bouth and distance of at least 6 miles from BANIYAN to intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 22 degrees 30 thence due south along meridian 62 to its intersection with parallel 19 and thence in a straight line intersecting parallel 18 with Violet Line, this can be referred to as “Brown Line' concession. 6. If this also proves insufficient, you may as a last resort and if you think there is hope of its leading to agreement, make a further offer in fUll sovereignty and without servitudes of area bounded by a line running from intersection of parallel 22 degrees 30 and meridian 52 due east to meridian 53 thence due south to intersection of meridian 53 with prolongation in a straight line of a at hem boundary of Brown Line concession described in preceding paragraph. His Majesty's Government are not prepared to make /make any concession 'to Itan Saud to east ox meridian 53* There is no evidence of his having any rights or permanent influence to East of this line greater or as great as that of any other Rulers concerned and there are other serious objec tions to allowing Ibn Saud to acquire such rights or influence there* You should not however allow yourself to he drawn into argument on this point and if this third oiier lails to satisfy King it will probably be necessary to suspend negotiations. Consequently while appreciating point in oaragr£|&gt;h 1 of your telegram No.89 1 consider that unless agreement is in sight this concession should only be offered very cautiously. In possible event of negotj-aciono not leading to early result their subsequent resumption would be on basis of position reached at the end of present discussions and if concession to meridian 53 is offered now without result we shaj-1 have lost our last concession for the purposes of future bargaining. 7. As you are aware and have yourself advised there are strongest objections to allowing Ibn Saud to acquire access to sea on Eastern side ol ^atar Peninsula or to establish a position for King as one of Trucial Coast ulers. Moreover territory claimed in depression east of •Green Line in this region has already been recognised by _.is Majesty’s Government as belonging to Shaikhs ol qatar and Abu Dhabi, His Majesty's Government having formally recognised rights of latter ( which they have maintained against Turks) in Ode id and also in nqal (compare Indi&lt;a Office memorcindum B.430 enclosed in Mr. Rendel’s letter oi March i.5th, 1934). There can accordingly be no question of any concession to Ibn Saud in this region. You should make this clear to Saudi Government explaining that you are un able to discuss any further concession east of green line north of Banaiyan. 8.- 4 - 8# Sub-committee also agreed that in view 01 legal and practical difficulties likely to arise it will be best not to attempt to define Saudi frontier in a purely negative sense as against a vacuum in the east ( e.g# by mere recognition by His Majesty*• Government that South-fast frontiers of Saudi Arabia are so and so) nor to secure purely negative renunciation by Ibn Saud (even if it could be obtained) of all rights or claims beyond those frontiers on the lines of Article lb of Treaty of Lausanne. Tney consider the best course will be to specify the 1rentier in a single comprehensive instrument as being concluded between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and ^atar y Abu Dhabi Muscat and the Aden Protectorate on the other (ffUt) without specifying boundary dividing the four latter territories from each other and to regard full sovereignty of other states concerned as extending right up to boundary line* Shaikh of ^atar and of Abu Dhabi and Aden Protectorate will be represented in the negotiations by His . majesty f s acvernment* Position as regards Muscat is more difficult ^nd has not yet been fully explored but for your confidential information India Office would be prepared if necessary and suoject to consent of Government of India to endeavour to obtain irom sultan authority for yourself or other British delegate to represent him* - SECRBT .RY OF STalE FOR - FOREIGN AFFAIRSTelegram xx To H.fcU’e Minister, Jedda.

In our opinion the only really important point is to prevent Ibn S&amp;ud from encroaching -*ast of Green Line to north of BANaIYAN.

Bin Baud wields some authority over the Hanasir through their paramount chief who lives in Hasa and has occasion ally extracted zakat from other tribes even up to Bahraimi I think that it is fair to put it that his personal prestige and thbt of Jiluwi gives him considerable influence but (except in case of Kanasir) hardly authority even to the east of the A1 Morrah area. This influence rapialy dwindles as one moves eastwards and I ao not think that he exercises any authority over Muscat Oman tribes. 2 2.

Your secret deSi&amp;tch No.263 of 20th August. South eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia. His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered position reached in negotiations and see little prospect of reaching settlement, which the&gt; regard as very desirable, more especially in view of existing international situation in Red Sea area., unless for more extensive offer is made to Ibn Saud, than that hitherto contemplated. They have never denied that Murra tribe was predominantly under Saudi influence and propose now to accept Ibn Saud’s authority over this tribe as one of main factors in the situation. Political Agent, Kuwait, has now received information from Beduin with Murra connections which shows (a) that great number of wells on Fuad Hamza’s list are probably Murra wells; (b) that dira of Murra tribe extends in south-east to Sabkhat Mijora which is not shown on maps but appears on sketch-map furnished by Political Agent as approximately at intersection of parallel 20 and meridian 54. From this point tribal boundary runs in south westerly curve to point apparently twenty to twenty-five miles south of Sh&amp;nna v/hence it proceeds in north-westerly curve cutting violet line. 2. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government consider Ibn Sadid might now be offered an area which in north, east and south will correspond closely with Murra dira. It is not proposed to offer him sovereignty over Murra dira ss such but rather to make latest information tesis of new and final offer while advancing positive claims of British proteges as /- 2 - '**! as irremovatie obstacles to sny Seudi demand for e-xtension of this very reasoricble and generous proposal. 3. This proposal will entril substantial concessions to Ibn Saud in northern sector but in south it mil not involve (and there is no intention of offer ng; concession of my territory to south of line running from intersection of violet line and parallel 18 to intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 19 (area ncorth of which has already been offered} end thence to intersection of meridian 54 and parallel 20. This should meet your minimum requirements as set forth in paragraph 8 of Ingrams* note oJ of 19th iugust accompanying your despatch under reference. 4. His Majesty*s Minister at Jedda will visit Ibn Saud at Riyadh in November and it is very desirable that fresh instructions should be res.dy before he leaves England about 25th October. Please therefore telegraph at very early date any observations on ?b ve new proposals.CONFIDENTIAL. No.795-S of 1935.

Foreign Office suggest that it would improve Ryan*e prospects of success in forthcoming negotiations if final offer which it is now proposed to amice to Ibn Sa’ud could be modified by substitution of meridian 56 for meri dian 54 as Eastern limit of proposed concession of territory. As rrea in question in empty desert this would not involve any further concession of material value but it might ease negotiations by bringing our offer as regards this section of line into closer relation with line claimed by Ibn Sa’ud (meridian 56). It is also understood that •aeridian 55 corresponds approximately with limit of Great E&amp;nds and therefore provides a more logical basis for delimitation. On the other hand in the absence of proof of claims by cur protegee to sands between meridians 54 and 55 it is difficult to argue that Ibn 6 a*ud should be confined to test of an arbitrarily fixed line leaving a vacuum on mBt of it.

Sir, His ASajesty’s Government are anxious to take advantage of your forthcoming visit to &amp;ing Abdul aziz at Riyadh to resume, and if possible to advance the negotiations which have been proceeding for a settlement of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it is probable that King Abdul Aziz himself will raise this question with you at an early stage, as i understand that it is one on which he feels strongly} and it is in fact the most important major question at issue between this country and Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2. You will recollect that after His Majesty's Government had decided not to take their stand, so long as negotiations were proceeding, on a rigid adherence to the legal basis provided by the frontier laid down in this region by the Anglo-Turkish agreements of 1913-14, you were instructed, in November 1934, to open negotiations with the Saudi GovernmenA for an agreed settlement of this question by endeavouring in the first place to obtain an ex act statement of King Abdul Aziz's territorial claims. The Saudi ''overnment , s response to your enquiry was delayed for several months, but they eventually furnished you, on the 3rd April last, with a memorandum putting forward a claim to a vast area in South-Eastern Arabia, which was asserted to correspond to the qreas frequented by certain tribes owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. You were already aware from the previous consideration which Hiswmmm - 2 - His ^a s Jesty , s UoYernment had {jlven to the matter that they were unahle to entertain such extensive demands, and you therefore proceeded immediately to the next stage contemplated in your instructions and offered to Saudi Arabia a small strip of territ ory - the so-called M green line 1 * concession - immediately to the east of the 1913-14 boundary. The subsequent departure of the De puty Saudi Minister for foreign Affairs from Jedda rendered an immediate continuance df negotiations impossible, but the t discussions were resumed with Fuad Bey Hamza himself during his vis£ to London last summer. 3. Despite the offer which was then made by His Majesty’s Government of a further territorial concession (bounded by the so- called 'brown line'), it unfortunately proved impossible to recon cile the divergency between the point of view of His Majesty’s Government (as then agreed upon between all the various depart ments of His Majesty’s Government concerned) and that of King Abdul Aziz, and, on Fuad Bey’s departure towards the end of July, the discussion closed in what appeared to be a complete deadlock. &gt; 4. in was explained to the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of these discussion that His Majesty’s Government were prepared, with a view to reaching an amicable sett lement, to make limited concessions, to the east of the 1913-14 boundary, of territory which, like that comprised in the areas already offered to the ■'ing, could be show to be predominantly utilised by tribes or settlements recognising his sovereignty. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that no satisfactoiy or durable frontier could be constructed on a purely tribal basis, in view of the shifting allegiance of the nomad tribes and of their wide and overlapping migrations. Tribal considerations were valuable5# — - valuable where It could be shown that an area was predominantly or exclusivefly frequented by a certain tribe with an exclusive political allegiance, but historical, geographical and strategic considerations would also have to be taken into account# The object of His Majesty’s Government was not to establish a rigid frontier in the Eurppean sense, but to work out a boundary as equitable as could be attained from all points of view, which would remove a source of uncertainty and friction by defining the territorial limits within which Saudi Arabia and the other Ar ab States concerned would respectively be free to exercise full sovereignty# Fuad Bey Hamza replied that his Government considered that the only basis for a settlement was to establish and allocate the grazing grounds in accordance with the }olitical allegiance of the desert trikes concerned# He maintained that the statement of King Abdul Aziz’s demands was drawn up on the basis of the graz ing grounds of four tribal groups, in particular of the wide- spread Ahl Murra tribe, who acknowledged Saudi sovereignty; and, in support of the line claimed by King Abdul Aziz he communicated ; | the names of 161 wells said to be owned by that tribe# Jfuad Bey criticised the concessions offered by His Majesty’s Govern ment as being purely arbitrary and not in accordance with the material facts of the situation in the desert# The S a udi Government had, he said, worked out, after the most searching investigation and enquiry, a carefully plotted and rational bound ary which took account of the political and taibal situation, and they were prepared to provide detailed evidence in support of their proposal; he insisted therefore that the next move lay with His Majesty’s Government, and that, if they did not agree with Saudi calims, it was for them to produce a detailed statement of their criticisms# Hitherto, he asserted, His aj cetyls Government had merely replied to he Saudi proposals by the simple counter offer of an arbitararily limited narrow area which failed to take account of the material facts#mmm 5* Hia Majesty’s Government are reluctant to!acquiesce in a continuance of the deadlock reached in the conversations with Puad Bey Hamza last summer without making aqy further attempt to reach an agreed settlement. As you yourself have advised, so long as this frontier question remains in its present indefinite state it stands in the way of the general and lasting settlement of Anglo-Saudi differences which his Majesty’s Government are anxious to bring aboutp Moreover, the rapid development of oil explotation on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf renders it ver -y desirable that a definite limit should be drawn between territories which would be recognised as being under the sovereign ty of King Abdul Aziz on the one hand, and as bei ng under that of the rulers of ^atar, of the Trucial Goast States and of Muscat on the other. Jtou will recollect that only in September last His Majesty endeavoured to stop the grant of an oil concession by the Shaikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian oil Company, on the ground that part of the concession area was included in his territorial claims* If the frontier is not settled there is a risk that similar difficulties may arise from the exploitation of the oil deposits in the Trucial Shaikhdoms if oil concessions should be granted therein* 6* It is clear, therefore, that every effort should be made, especially at the present critical juncture in world affairs, to reach an agreed settlement of the dispute, to put an end to an uncertain and unsatisfactory situation, and to remove a source of friction which has already had an unforturate effect upon the general course of Anglo-Saiidi relations. With this object in view His Majesty’s Government, after obtaining fresh information from the British authorities of the Persian Gulf and of the Aden Protectorate, feave reconsidered the whole question, and they are prepared/ ) t / * (fe&gt; - 5 - prepared to go to the extreme limit of concession in the endeavour to formulate new proposals to meet the claims of King Abdul Aziz in the greatest possible measure. They have accordingly decided to authorise you to seek a favourable opportunity during the course of your forthcoming visit to Riyadh to resume negotiations in the matter, if possible with King Abdul Aziz himself, but otherwise with hie Ministers, and to furnish you with the following instructions for your guadance. 7. You will begin by informing King Abdul Aziz that, as a re sult of the conversations with Kuad Bey Hamza last summer in Lon don, the whole question of the frontiers in South-Has tern Arabia has been fully reconsidered by His m ajesty*s Government, after consultation with the local British authorities in Arabia. In particular His Majesty*s Government have rs-examined the boundary claimed by King Abdul Aziz as described in the memorandum communi cated to you on the 3rd April last, in the light of the detailed evidence supplied by ifuad Bey Hamza, of the arguments advanced by him in the course of discussion, azid of the further information collected by the British authorities in the ju?eas concerned. y 0 u will then express in g neral terms the earnest desire of His Maj esty*s Government to go as far as possible to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz in an amicable settlement of the question, laying stress at the same time on the long standing treaty obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the independent rulers of the Arab States in South-Eastern Arfcbia. you should emphasise the importance mhich His Majesty’s Government attach to their historic position in the Persian Gulf, and the impossib ility of their agreeing to any solution which might in any way prejudice or impair that position or injure the interests of the Arab States with whom they are in special treaty relations. 8.- 6 - 8. At this stage you may at your discretion decide to inform King Abdul Aziz that you are in possession of new proposals by His Majesty’s Government. Before describing these proposals ycu desire, however, to make it clear why His Majesty’s Government, after full and sympathetic enquiry into the material facts of the situation, have net felt able to accept the boundary which the King had himself suggested. You should then proceed to explain in detail the reasons which prevent His Majesty’s Government from accepting the boundary proposed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April last, developing for this purpose the relevant arguments used in discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer as set out in the records of the meetings. 9. Beginning at the northern end of the proposed Saudi line you should point out the importance which His Majesty’s Govern ment attach to establishing a frontier in accordance with geographical, as well as political and tribal, considerations. The (^ater peninsula forms a clearly defined and separate geographical unit, and it is only reasonable that the frontier between the Sheikhdom and its neighbours should follow the natural division between the peninsula and the mainland. His Majesty’s Government have already expressed readiness to depart from their strict legal position by recognising King Abdul Aziz’s sovereignty as extending over the western shore of the gulf known as the Dohat-as-SaIwa and over the Ikhwan settlements at the head of the Gulf; but they could never consent to attribute to Saudi Arabia features, such, for example, as the Jebel Naksh, which form an integral part of the physical structure of the Qatar peninsula itself and have always, in fact, been an equally integral part of the Shaikhdom. An additional factor in regard to the frontier of Qatar is the grant by the Shaikh to //1 /**V ✓ V -7- to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, with the full approval of His Majesty’s Covernment, of an oil concession over the Shaikhdom of Qatar. This concession, which was granted on the 11th May last, while not extending beyond the limits of the State of Qatar, as claimed by the Shaikh of Qatar and recognised as his territory by His Majesty’s Government, does actually extend to the south of the line claimed by King Abdul Az,iz (cf. paragraph 5 above); but the position in this respect will be already known to His Majesty through the communication which I instructed Mr. Calvert to make by my telegram No. 112 of the 20th September. Should you decide to advert to this development, you should take the opportunity to recall the fact that His Majesty’s Government have formally assured the Shaikh of Qatar of their protection c against any interference with his territorial rights. 10. Turning to the problem of the Khor-al-Odeid (to which Fuad Hey Hamza attached special importance), you will explain to King Abdul Aziz that, as Fuad Bey was informed in London, His Majesty’s Government Lave long recognised officielly the validity of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's claim to the whole of this inlet, and have regarded his territory as extending round both the Khor-al-Dhuwsihin and the Khor-al- Odeid up to a line, running westwards from the northern side of the mouth of the Khor-al-Odeid, which forms the boundary between the territory of Abu Dhabi and that of Qatar. His Majesty's Government naturally cannot violate or disregard their obligations to these Arab rulers with whom, as the King has recognised by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, they te ve long-standing and special treaty relations. Should you consider it wise or desirable to do so, you are authorised to develop frankly to the King a further argument which /which was used with Fuad Bey Hs-mz? in London; namely, that His Majesty’s 'Government have had for many years a particularly strong interest in the chain of Arab States on the coast between Qatar and Muscat; that the maintenance of this position is an important principle of British policy in the Persian Gulf; and that it would be at complete variance with this policy for them to agree that a powerful State such as Saudi Arabia should acquire a new outlet to the ses on this section of the coast, to which neither political nor geographical considerations entitle it. 11. Pursuing your reply to the claims put forward in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, you should explain that a thorough reinvest!gation of the situation has now been made \jy the British authorities in the Persian Gulf in order to escertain the precise limits of the territory of the Shaikh- / / dom of Abu Dhabi in the hinterland ofjthe coastal stiip. As a result it has been established that the district known as Al Aqal, the Sa bkhat Matti salt marshes, and the districts shown on the maps as Bainunah, Dhafrah and Qufat-al-Liwa, all of which lie outside the area predominantly covered by the Ahl Murra tribe, are within the historic possessions of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. His Majesty’s Government are accordingly unable to agree to the eastward prolongation of the proposed boundary being carried as near to the sea coast as suggested in the Saudi memorandum oft he 3rd April, since this would, in their opinion, be incompatible v/ith their obligation to protect the rights of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Similarly, they can find no justification for the extension of the claims of King Abdul Aziz as far east as meridian 56° since this would result in the inclusion in Saudi territory of the steppe country beyond the Great Sands, and of the grazing grounds of tribes owing allegiance either to the Shaikh of i-9- Abu Dhabi or to the Sultan of Muscat, 12. You will then inform King Abdul Aziz that the tribal position on the southern fringe of the Ruba-al-Khali desert and in the northern part of the Hadhrsmaut has also been the subject of detailed reinvestigation since the statement of his boundary claim was received last April, As a result His Majesty’s Crovernment are satisfied that the tribes depending on the Aden Protectorate - and in particular the Al Saiar, A1 Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra - normally range not only to the edge of the Great Sands between parallels 17° and 19° Ncr th, but for some little distance into the sands themselves. You should explain that His Majesty’s 9overnment were informed by T?uad Hey Hamza, during the course of the conversations in London last summer, that King Abdul Aziz did not claim the allegiance of these tribes, and their enquiries have now definitely shown that the southern and south-eastern limits of the district predominantly frequented by the Ahl Murra (which they understand to form the basis of the Saudi claims in this area) do not extend to the edge of the sands, but lie a considerable distance to the north and north-west of the line claimed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April. 13. You should then proceed formally to put forv/ard the new offer which His Majesty’s Government, in the light of the foi e- going considerations, have now resolved to make, emphasising once more that it is made with every desire to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz to the furthest possible extent, but adding in no ambiguous terms that it represents a final concession which His Majesty’s Government will not be able to increase. I trust that you will thus dispel as far as possible any impression in the King’s mind that, in now putting forward proposals much more favourable to him than the two territorial concessions already / m- 10 - already offered, His Majesty’s Government A?ould be likely to yield still further in response to continued bargaining on his part. /s you are aware, this is e point to which the India Office attach much importance. You should explain that the new boundary which you are about to offer has been carefully worked out, and that while the geographical, his torical and political considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs have naturally been taken into full consideration, the new proposals also take account of the full and detailed information which His Majesty’s Government have now received from their local authorities in Arabia regarding the wanderings and habitats of the Ahl Hurra tribe. In the light of this information His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree in principle to recognise King Abdul Aziz’s claim to the allegiance of the Ahl Murra tribe, and they have endeavoured to align their proposed boundary so as to include as far as possible within Saudi Arabia the grazing grounds (’’dire”) exclusively or predominantly utilized by the various noir^-dic sections of this tribe. 14. As you are aware, the Political Agent at Kuwait has recently reported that the Murra 'dira* appears to be bounded on the north, east and south by a line running, from a point south of Hofuf, parallel to but inland from the neck of the Qatar Peninsula; continuing in a south-easterly direction along the southern edge of the Sabkhat Matt-j marsh; turning south-south-east at the south-eastern corner of the Sabkhat Matti; running thence straight across the Eastern Rub’-al-Khali as far as the Sabkhat Mi j ora (approximately at the intersection of meridian 54°E. and parallel 20P N.); and thence sweeping westwards, within the southern /southern limit of the Great Sands, so as just to include the important group of wells at Shanna: I enclose herein a copy of r valuable map prepared by Colonel Dickson to illustrate the result of his recent enquiries 15, You are authorised to make such use as you think best of this information; but you shoulc be careful not to give the impression that His Majesty’s Government have in ary way abandoned their objections, as explained to Fusd Bey Hamza in London, to baaing the frontier solely on tribal considera tions, To do so might only encourage the belief that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to modify their offer in the light of further statements regarding tribal settle ments or M diras H , and might lead the Saudi Government to embark on a lengthy, and inevitably fruitless, argument as to the precise areas covered by tribal migrations. At the same time, you should make thejsest possible use of the fact that, in their new proposals, His Majesty’s Government are offering to recognise the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz over practically the whole ’’dira” of the Ahl Murra tribe, even as defined by the *information communicated by Fu&amp;d Bey Hamza at the time of the conversations in London, 16, After these preliminary observations you should, subject to confirmation by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of the exact location of key-points A and B mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) below, and to further telegrpphic instructions in regard to the eastern sector of the frontier derlt with in sub-paragraph (c) below, make a formal offer of the following line as the boundary between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and the Shaikhdoms of ^atar and Abu Dhabi (in special relations with His Majesty’s Government), / (l) (l) not reproduced- 12 - Government), the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and the Aden Protectorate, on the other (a) A line starting from a point* on the eastern shore of the Gulf known as the Dohat-as-3alwa, about 4 miles to the north-east of the settlement of Q,asr-as-Salw?, running thence in r straight line to a point, which may for convenience of reference be called rt Key-point A”, which will probably lie at the western extremity of the salt lake known as Sabkhat-al-Amra . (b) From this point the line will run roughly due south to a point to be known as 'Key-point B'. This point, when fixed, will be situated approximately on the northern boundary of the Murra 'dira* as drawn in the light of the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government ( i .e • on Colonel Dickson’s map (see paragraph 14 above)). it is proposed to fix this key-point B at some well on the southern edge of the district known as A1 Aqal (i.e. a short distance east of the intersection of meridian 5? E. with parallel 24°N.) to which a positive claim can be advanced on behalf of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The Political Resident is still making enquiries as to the precise points at which these two key-points A and B could reasonably and properly be fixed, and further instructions will be sent to you as soon as his reports have been received and a decision has been reached by His Majesty’s Government thereon. (c) From key-point B it is proposed that the boundary should proceed, generally speaking, in a straight line, but so as to leave the whole of the Sabkhat Matti to Abu /Abu Dhabi to the intersection of parallel 2£? N. with meridian 54° (or 5$) E* and thence down that meridian to its intersection with pa-rallel 20°N. The Political Resident is being consulted on the question of substituting meridian 55°E* for meridian 54°E. as originally proposed, for this sector of the line, and telegraphic instructions will be sent to you on this jboint as soon as possible. (d) Thence the boundary will run in an approximately straight line, but so as to leave the Sabkhat Mij ora in Saudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mugshin in Muscat and Oman, to the intersection of meridian 52°E* and parallel 19°N (namely the south-eastern corner of the ares - the so-called ’’brown line' concession - offered to Fuad Bey Hamza in London last July), and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel IT. with the 'violet line' of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, 17. Your detailed comments n n the proposed line, which you may make at whatever stage seems to you most appropriate, should be based on the following considerations J You should make what capital you can out of the small further concession which the new line offers at its northern end, in that it lies considerably east of the so-called 'green line' which you were instructed to offer to the Saudi Government last April, You should empahsise that, as a result of their further thorough study of the matter, His Majesty’s Government are now prepared folly to admit the Saudi claim to the wells at Banaiyan, to which Fuad Bey attached such particular importance last summer. You should also lay stress on the fact that the sector of the line defined in sub-paragraph (b) of the preceding paragraph represents a genuine attempt to meet the Saudi claim while respecting the territory of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. You will then do your beat to make it clearclear, while not letting it be thought that the line is drawn on a purely tribal basis, that the line now proposed leaves within Saudi Arabia the whole of the Murra 'dira* according to the latest information in the possession of His Majesty* s Grovernment (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, in carrying the boundary as far east as they are now doing, His Majesty’s Government will be recognising the authority of King Abdul Aziz as extending beyond the ”dira' of the Murra tribe into the southern part of that of the Manasir, who are a tribe predominantly based on territory under the sovereignty of Abu Dhabi, You may then point out. that the southern section of the proposed line, described in sub-paragraph (d) of the preceding paragraph, leaves not only the whole of the Murra 'dira* in this region v/ithin Saudi territory, but also the important wells at Shanna , although these are used by tribes from the Aden Protectorate almost as much as by the Ahl Murra, In conclusion, it will be well for you to explain that, although the proposed boundary, like that proposed by King Abdul /ziz himself, is in its eastern and southern sections necessarily artificial, and based mainly on geographical co-ordinates, His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that it represents a fair and reasonable division between the various suzerainties concerned. 18. Lastly, you should make every endeavour to ensure that in any settlement eventually reached all tribes are left free to use their normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the line they may be situated. 19. Basing youself on the broad lines of the instructions contained in the preceding paragraphs, I request that you will make every effort to secure the acceptance in principle by King Abdul Aziz of the new boundary proposed by His Majesty’s Government. In the event of agreement being reached, they are st ill /atill inclined to favour the procedure suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir J* Simon*s telegram No*70 of the 1st May, namely,the incorporation of the new line in s single ccinp-i. ehenai^ e instrument in which the frontier would ce del ined as be*.ng between Saudi Arabia 0 n the one hand and Q,atar r Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate on the other* ihis point is, however, premature at the present time, ss is also the question of the possible final demarcation of the frontier in the vicinity of the ^atar peninsula.

Fuad 1 s most important new point regarding qatar bounaftry was that we were asking more for Bhaikh than he himself /- 2 - himself bad claimed in the p^et. Pued maintained that Shaikh had at one time begged Ibn Saud more ^6 a favour than as a right to leave him undisturbed in JKBKL DUKHAN and ARAi^,. King had acquiesced in this at the time and no longer pressed claim te ARAI^ which had been made in memorandum of April 3rd but he could not give up J. «BKL HAKSH* Fuad asserted that ccrueepordenee R h the subjeet between bhaikh and Ibn Jiluwi was prior to Anglo-O&amp;tfcr Treaty of 1916. He suggested fibs ikh wre thetv free agent and that agreement with Ibn Jiluwi was therefore juridically binding. He also urged that J1BFX 1I-KSH wao ne?ceesary for defence of SALWA and that a frontier between it and JKBKL JUKHaH wo Id correspond with natural features* 5. I resisted these arguments to the best of ray rbility, */y impreesion was that Fuad^ instructions were to keep NAKBH at all costs but that King would r tandon KHOI' OP'?JO. This was confirmed by non-commital ( persone! ) language of Fuad November 20th. 6. 1 asserted strongly position of His Majesty's Government in regard to Coastal hulers generally and emphasised promise of protection which they had given Sheikh of Qatar. 7. Principal advance made eo far is that King no longer approaches matter with the bitterneea which he displayed last year at TaIF. He realises that he cannot secure all that he asked for in memorandum of April 3rd but he hopes to bargain for better terms than Kis Majesty's Government have offered. 1 gave him and Fuad no encourage ment to expect further concessions.

Saudi Arabia. 17th January 1936. , N My dear Eowle, You will remember that when I was discussing the eastern and south-eastern frontier question with Euad Hamza at Riyadh he suggested that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman would agree to any frontier we might propose between his territories and Saudi Arabia, because he had so much trouble with two personages in the interior viz. A1 Khalili and A1 Kharusi. The implication was that it would pay the Sultan to have a definite frontier, within which his authority would be internationally recognised. I have long thought that the presence in the hinterland of Muscat towards Saudi Arabia of quas i-independent authorities might become important, if they were people with whom Ibn Saud could hope for some understanding, a possibility which would depend on various factors, including their religious outlook. I have never, however, been able to get a clear idea of who and what they are, although one sees occasional references, e.g. in Muscat Intelligence Report No.16 of 1934, to an Imam, whose authority seems to be greater than that of the Sultan of Muscat. The old Handbook of Arabia Volume I pp.247-248 gives some account of an Ibadhi religious teacher named Abdullah Ibn Humaid As-Salimi, an Ibadhi religious teacher and his son-in- law Salim Ibn Rashid A1 Kharusi, whom the former had sent up as Imam of Tanuf. On the other hand de Gauiy gave me last May the name of the Imam in the Oman hinterland es Muhammad Ibn Abdullah al Khalili. He had got this name not long before from that Libyan Odysseus, Suleyman. Al Baruni, who had I understand been Lt -Col. 7 ’. C.Fowle, C.B.E., Bushire. for /for a time in the service of the said Imam, My impression is that Ibn Saud knows very little about 0 these gentlemen but that he knows a bit more than he did two or three years a^o, when Fuad asked me, 1 think in genuine ignorance, whether there was not some other ruler in the hinter land of Muscat. You probably have a good deal more informa tion. I should be grateful for anything you could tell me as to (a) who the people are (b) the range of their present authority and (c) the likelihood of their having or developing any connexion with Ibn Saud. He might like to nobble them, if their remoteness and religious tenets did not make it impossible, in the same way that he nobbled the people in Najran. I am sending copies of this to the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office and privately to de Gaury, who is interested in the matter and was one of the sources of my present meagre information. Yours ever, sd. Anarew Ryan. P.S. After drafting this letter I discovered that the enquiry by Fuad, mentioned in the first sentence of paragraph 5, is much more recent than I thought. It took place on February 7th last and is mentioned in the record of my conversation with him on that date which I sent to the Foreign Office and to Bushire, among others, on February 9th 1935. Id. A.RI -s ConfidUPtiRl. 3 # Q &lt; Ho # lb3-S of 1936. ?he Residency, Bushire, 2nd March, 1936. Hill you please refer to your demi-official letter No. 1G7/3&amp;G/3 of the 17th January 1936 in which you ack for information regarding the Cra&amp;ni tribes and their leaders. 2 . I enclose a note giving the antecedents of the persons about whom you enquire, and ay views as to the probability of 1 bn Baud 'nobbling* the Omanis. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter with enclosure, as well as &amp; copy of your letter, to ?atts at Mviscat, with the request that he will give hisflote op leading Personalities in uny n, with reference to Sir Andrew yan*s deaii^official lotter Ko«lQ7/38Q/6 of 17th January 1936 to Colonel ffowle 1. It must first be explained that the M rharusi and Al Khalili mentioned in paragraph 1 are not personages, but families* 2. There had been from early times an Imam of Hue cat and Oman, whose power was spiritual as well as temporal, and who was appointed by election* 3. The removal of the capital from HtlSTAQ, in the interior to Muscat about 100 years ago weakened the Sultan's hold on the omani tribes* 4. In 1913 the Omani tribes rose in revolt against the Sultan, egged on by the blind Ibadhi mullah shaikh Abdullah bin Humaid as Salimi , and elected Salim bin Rashid al al Kharusi as their Imam. The Imam appointed his brother Basir bin Rashid al Kharusi as his ali in Ruetaq. The revolt continued during the war, assisted by Turkish propaganda and culminated in a serious attack on Muscat in 1913, by a large force of Omanis. This force which advanced within about 6 niles of the town, was driven back by British troops, which vere then stationed at Muscat# 5. In spite of the fact that the Bui tan's control over the Omanis was nominal, he made various abortive attempts to establish his rule over the interior. In 1920, under the guidance of the Political Agent, negotiations were opened for stablizing the situation as between the Sultan and /V''' V 4 •/ tiff w-V 4 / ^ V , 0 vK'' • ^ j *+4 -v ^ l ^ %U K Ol X , J • X- • &gt; 4^ ( V' } &lt;- t .A* 4 \ &lt;V 4 — 2 — and the Omanis. The Imam proving obdurate, the Sultan imposed a penal tax of 25$ on datee coming down from the interior. This caused much discontent in Oman, chiefly directed against the Imam who, still refusing to come to terns with the Sultan, was murdered by his own subjects. The Sultan, Sir Taimur bin Fa leal, father of the present Holer, then managed to secure the election of hie father-in-law, v -ohamed bin Abdullah al /Jhalili as Imam. After further negotiations, a treaty was signed in 1920, which left the Imam supreme in the interior of Oman, but stipulated that the Omanie should pay certain dues on their goods entering and leaving the Muscat ports. The treaty is recognised by the lovernment of India as a most satisfactory solution of the relations between the 3 ultan and the Omanis, but - an important point - we are not responsible for its enforcement on either party. Hince the signature of the treaty there has been peace between the Sultan and the Omanis. 5. The predominant personality in '&lt;nan until recently was Shaikh Tea bin Salih al Harithi , who had been, as the leader of the Fin&amp;wi confederation, one of the Imam's principal supporters in the rebellion. But his influence is now declining before that of his son drtaikh Mohammed bin Isa al Harithi. It was, incidentally, Shaikh Isa who signed the 1920 treaty with the Sultan on behalf of tae Imara. y a / -'*S cv * ?. The present position as between the Sultan end the Omanis is that though the former still calls himself Sultan of Muscat and Oman, the latter to ail intents and purposes are independent. At the same time, if they should flagrant ly break the treaty or otherwise show hostility towards him, he lias the i?hip-hand of them as the ports, from which they get their goods, are in his iiands. 8 . /-3- \ &lt; a-A! / , V r f A' ro ^ n V K.—r'’’* 8. a* regards &amp; possible rapprochement between Tbn Saud and the ^3manie; this might arise if the Sultan at any time made a threat on their independence, of which, like all mount* Ineerts, they are extremely Jealous, The I tad hi sect to which the Omanis belong has certain affinities with Wahabism. Indeed, some of the thafiri tribes, notably the ^eni Bu All near hur, are Wahabis. At the same time the ^nanis would, poaaitoly, be astute enough to realise that to put themselves under Ibn Saud would be to Jump from the frying pan into the fire. 9. as to your question (b), on the range oi the iniluence of the I bad hi leaders! it is, of course, impossible to lay down its limits more precisely tnan by saying that roughly speaking the Oiatnia control the hinterland and the Sultan the co&amp;st&amp;l plain.

Bin Saud wields some authority over the Manasir through their paramount chief who lives in Hasa and has occasionally extracted zakat from other tribes even up to Baraimi. I think that it is fair to put it that his personal prestige and that of Jiluwi gives him considerable influence but (except in case of Manasir) hardly authority even to the east of the A1 Morrah area. This influence rapidly dwindles as one moves eastwards and I do not think that he exercises any authority over Muscat Oman t ribes. 2. In informal conversation in October 1934, Sultan told Bremner what he considered boundaries of Sultanate. From Bar aimi south he regards his western boundary as the sands of the Great Desert. North of Dhofar there are three plateaux or ranges of hills named in receding order from the sea Al Qsra, Al Qat n and Al Najd. Area known as Al Najd borders on Great Desert and is regarded as Muscat territory. Eastern edge of Great Desert is still for practical purposes blank on the map, but points (a), (b), (c) of your telegram seem to be sufficiently outside area mentioned by Sultan to make it poss ible to concede them to Bin Saud. 3. /wmmmm - 2 - 3 .

The enclosure is, if I may say ao, admirably clear and to the point. It fills a gap in my knowledge which has long troubled me. You do not mention haring sent copies to any one except Watts, as I sent a c py of my letter of January 17th to the Foreign Office, 1 am venturing to send copies of your letter and enclosure to Rend el together with a copy of this. I am sure that whether Watta has anything to add or not, your reply to my enquiries will be of great interest to the Eastern Department. Yours ever, sd. amdrew ryah.

Received 11.35.a.m. 19th March Addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies repeated to the British Minister at Jedda Tour telegram of the 15th March Aden is concerned only with boundary line west of approximately longitude 53. In paragraph 8 cf Ingrams* note of 19th August 1935 forwarded to you with Lake*s secret despatch of the &amp;Qth August 1935 certain principles were proposed to govern our attitude regarding this frontier which most important was that no steppe land or territory occupied by our tribes to the north cf Eadhramaut valley should be surrendered. I agree with this view and in accordance with it line proposed in your telegram to me Ko.8Q of 1935 represents the utmost concession that can be made. Line suggested by Fuad Hom^a would violate this principle as it would cut through territory of Mahra Manahil Awamir and Seiar tribes. The irst cf these ie racially and politically connected with Ciehn the second and fourth with Mukalla and the third with Kathiris and prospectively thus with Aden Protectorate, The proposed line in this sector cannot be therefore carried further south without giving Dha footing within outlying border of Hadhramaut and a possible opening for further exte sion of his influence that would have politically a disturbing effect on treaty chiefs and their people in that part of the Protectorate. There would also be a likelihood of interference with gracing and watering rights of tribes coxicerned. These developments would thus adversely al ect both Imperial and local interests. I am also strongly opposed to an; boundary that intersect tribal territcry. Our experience of divided control over Audhali/P.2.2123/1956 79100/36. SECRET. Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.vv.l* 26th March, 1936. We have received your telegram of the 19th March about the south eaat rn frontiere of Saudi Arabia and we note thet in your view the line proposed in cur telegram No. 80 (of the 9th October 1935) represents the utmost concession that can be made to Ibn Saud west of meridian 53° East. In actual fact, the frontier which was offered to Ibn Gaud at Riyadh would, east of meridian 52° East, lie very slightly to the south of that defined in paragraph 3 of our telegram No. 80 {ooe paragraphs 5 and 6 Of enclosure I to Jedda despatch of the 10th December, 1935, a copy of which was sent to you direct), but we assume th*t such a slight modification need not be regarded as adversely affecting any local Protectorate interests at this spot. We colled your attention to this point in paragraph 2 of our secret despatch of the 6th November last. I should explain that this further slight concession to Ibn Saud was suggested at the last moment,79X00/36. P.Z. 1909/1936. CYPIiBH TELEGRAM from the Secretary or State for the colonies to the Resident at Aden* Sent 12.30 p*m. 15th March,1956. Addressed to Aden Ho:25 Repeated to Jedda Ho:36 Reference Jedda despatch to Foreign Office lTo.351 of the 10th December, 1935, a copy of which was sent to you direct. His Majesty^ Government have decided that in the first instance and as the next step Saudi Government should be asked for further information as to agreement stated to have been concluded before 1916 between Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Qatar by which latter is stated to have accepted former's sovereignty over Jebel Rakhsh* If is not proposed to issue further instructions to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda on general question of frontiers until this point has been cleared up. As matters stand at present there is no intention of offering Ibn Saud any further concession of territory but it is important that His Majesty's Government should be in possession of fullest possible information when the time comes to issue final instructions to Sir Andrew Ryan. To this end your early views are invited on Fuad Hamza's suggestion (reported in paragraph 22 of second enclosure to Jedda despatch under reference) that a line might be drawn run somewhere between the line proposed by His Majesty's Government (see paragraphs 6 and 7 of first enclosure to Jedda despatch under reference) and that proposed in the Saudi memorandum of 3rd April 1955. In particular I should be glad to learn whether in your view any Imperial or local intere. us would be adversely affectou if the proposed line in this sector we^e nrirrifid/No # C/65 To Salalah, Dhofar.

Your Highness, $ith reference to our conversation on the subject quoted above I am writing formally to state that I have been instructed by His Majesty»s Government to inform Your Highness that they are endeavouring to negotiate a treaty with His Majesty Ibn Saud which would determine amongst other matters the Muscat Saudi Frontier, 2, The negotiations cover the whole question of the South and Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia and are part of wider negotiations which, it is hoped,will consolidate the cordial relations existing between His Majesty*s Government and Ibn Saud but as parts of the Frontier to be negotiated are of interest to Muscat His Majesty*s Government desire to inform Your Highness of the present position, o. Ibn Saud has made claims in South East Arabia to a wide area the whole of which His Majesty*s Government are not prepared to recognise. They, however, see no objection to recognising Ibn Saud*3 claim to an area in the Great Sands 0 extending eastwards as far as Meridian 55 E ast between o o parallels £2 and 20 and South to a line drawn from the o latter point to the intersection of Meridian 52 ana o parallel 19 , 4. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to hear what Your Highness regards as the western bounaary of your dominions and whether it would encroach on territory to tthieh Muscat has a supportable claim or would adversely aifect Muscat2. Muscat interests if the offer of a boundary to be made to Ibn Saud mentioned in the preceding paragraph were now to run as follows (For ease of reference the various points indicated have been given descriptive letters). o ‘ r 0 From the intersection of Meridian 52 and parallel 20 a (C) to a point at intersection of Meridian 54 40 1 and parallel 22 40 f (B) thence to a point at intersection of Meridian 55 o 40* and parallel 22 (E) and thence to intersection of Meridian o o , , , 55 and parallel 20 (G), thence in an approximately straight line to the intersection of Meridian 52 and parallel IS (H), (but so as to leave Sabkhat Majora to Ibn Saud and Ramlat Mugshin to Muscat) and thence in a straight line oo the inter— ° o section of parallel IS and Meridian 48 50* (I)* The abovementioned sectors are those with which Muscat would be concerned. 5, Would Your Highness also please state for the information of His Majesty*s Government whether you consider that Muscat interests y/ould be adversely affected if (a) the proposed, line between points G and E were taken further to the South (b) the eastern sector of the line between points G and J were taken o to Meridian 56 . (point J is the intersection of a line, drawn from point D x 0 to point E, with Merdian 55 ). Your Highness*s sincere friend, Political-Translation of a letter dated at Dhofar 24th Safar lo55 (15th May 1936) from His Highness Saiyid Said hin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, to Major R.P* Watts, Political Agent 6c H.B.k's Consul, Muscat. After Compliments, With reference to our conversation during your / last visit to Dhofar where you stayed two nights and your letter dated the 25th April which you delivered to me before your departure. I have understood the contents of your letter and what you have told me verbally in accordance with the instructions received from my friend His Majesty f s Govern ment in connection with the Western boundary of my country. In reply I thank His Majesty^ Government for 3 the trouble they are taking in a matter which concerns the interests of my Government but as I have already informed you verbally this is a very difficult question and requires considerable time before I can send an answer to it. I have to refer to my records and papers and then I shall be able '■■4 to let you know about the proposed boundary and give the names of places which define the said boundary. Several months will be required to go into this matter. As regards the boundary which has to be fixed 4 between me and Ibn Saud as has been indicated by you by reference to points of latitude and longitude and which His Majesty’s Government proposes to give to King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, 1 state that although I know something about geographical maps perhaps the marking of the boundary by references to points of latitude and longitude may not define the correct line of my boundary. It is therefore necessary to make careful enquiries as to whether these lines correspond with the places which define my boundary. 5 .

That letter covered an express letter dated 10th June from the Political Agent, Muscat, in which he said that he enclosed the correct copy of his letter No.c/d3 dated 2oth April which he gave to the Sultan on his last visit to Dhofar. The copy of the letter dated 25th April which we have received does not, however, appear to be correct. por instance, in paragraph 4 the intersection of o o Meridian 54 40* and Parallel 20 40” is mentioned when ( the parallel in question should actually be Parallel 22 40”. Also at the end of the paragraph the intersection o o of Parallel 18 and Meridian 46 is mentioned when actually the point in question is the point at which o Parallel 18 intersects the violet line of the Anglo- Turxish Convention, viz. the intersection of Parallel 18 o and Meridian 43 30”. Is the explanation that the copy which we have been sent is not in fact the correct copy ? It seems important to make sure that the letter actually sent to the Sultan was correct in every particular.

He had no counter proposals to make to latest offer of His Majesty’s Govern ment, claimed that southern boundary proposed by Saudi Government was besed on essential needs of tribes and professed indifference to suggestion that line along longtitude 55 E might be moved eastwards, on the ground that country thereabouts is desert. Tailing advantage of change of Minister he tried the transparent manoeuvre ^ pretending that His Majesty’s Government had always been most keen about Khor al Odeid and much less so about Jabal Nuaksh which Saudi Government regarded as most important.

He repeated what he had already said in his letter of 15th May 1936 ( forwarded to you under my Express Letter C-71 of 1 0th June 1936 ) that to give a clear definition of his boundaries and of his interests and claims in the areas effected was a matter of extreme difficulty for him inasmuch as such a thing had never been previously done* He said that he had ; since I first approached him in this connection at Dhofar, been making inquiries to obtain information on which to work out his land boundary but declared that it would still require a condiderable time to complete this*— 2 — In my opinion if he can possibly avoid the Sultan will not commit himself to a definite boundary on the land side of his State. In addition to certain difficulties attendant upon such an undertaking for instance lac*: oi natural geographical features which could be used as descriptive points, the absence of records etc., a good deal of rather troublesome work would have to be carried out which no Muscat official would ever willingly do. in order to try and get the Sultan to come to a decision regarding his attitude on the various proposed boundaries to be offered to Ibn Sa’ud as the eastern limits of his domains I had plotted and drawn out on a map the line joining the points mentioned in my letter to him Ho.C/65 dated uhofar 25th April 1936 ( copy sent you under my Express Letter of 10th June No.C-71). This map I gave to the Sultan who too*: it away with him and promised to let me have a reply shortly as regards this particular question. I think he will agree to accept as unobjectionable from the Muscat Governments point of view an eastern boundary for Ibn Sa*ud defined by a line joining the points C.D.E.G.H. and I. This boundary question seems to have alarmed the Sultan especially now that oil concessions are ' in the air' and he appears more reluctant to commit himself each time the subject is brought up. I hope however shortly to be able to persuade him to agree to the line mentioned in paragraph 4 above.Enclosure in Colonial Office covering note dated 5th March, 1937, No. 79100/7/37 Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram APE N. SECRET. No.6 of the ISth of January, and to previous telegraphic correspondence, and to inform you that the piestion of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia has recently formed the subject of further discussion by the Departments concerned. 2 . His Majesty’s Government have reached the conclusion that, in view of certain important Imperial and international considerations which are briefly set out below, it is desirable that every endeavour should be made to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the ques tion of these disputed frontiers. 3. In the first place the contingency must be envisaged that the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine and the subsequent decisions of His Majesty’s Government will not give general satisfaction to the people of Palestine, and that as a consequence there may be a recrudescence of disorder in that country on a more serious scale than has hitherto been experienced. Moreover, it is likely that the effects of such developments, in so far as they arise from Arab opposition, would not be confined to Palestine alone, but that the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the independent A*rab States throughout Arabia would be adversely affected; and there is the obvious APE N. SECRET. possibility / AT ADEN.possibility that Italian activities in Arabia would be directed, in such an event to widening the breach. It is of importance that no unnecessary strain should be placed upon the relations betv/een His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Saudi-Arabia at such a critical time; and the conclusion of a friendly agreement in this frontier dispute should appreciably improve those relations. 4. In these circumstances, it has been suggested that the position of the frontier negotiations should be reviewed, and that consideration should be given to the question whether some further concession cannot be made towards meeting King ibn Baud's claims both in the more northern area and in the Aden Protectorate zone. Solhr as the Protectorate is concerned, I shall be obliged if you will consider whether, in the light of t as despatch, some additional concession might not be made in the area between parallels 17 and 18, particularly to the west of meridian 51. It is desirable that the question should be examined from the point of view of the limits of the area over which our tribes have indubitable claims, rather than with a view to the exclusion of King ibn Baud from districts of which the ownership is quite indeterminate. It is realised that the cession of any uart of the territory to the north of the Hadramaut would mean sciib deminution in the desert area which separates the Protectorate from foreign territory, and on the retention of which great importance has been laid in the past. Nevertheless I feel that the special considerations mentioned above justify me in asking you once again to review the posicion and report whether some further concession can be made in the Protectorate zone without sacrificing local interests.

It is true that the position of the southern end of the fahana has never been fixed, but such evidence as we have seems to show that a line drawn south 30 degrees east from the southern end of the* westerly edpe of the Uahana would cut the coast well to the cast of Wfe-h«t All, the point of division between the liafliramaut and Oman. In support of this contention I would cite Mr. Philby's 'fhe hpty barter', page 344 and the The -ii -ht Honour Me Ant ionv Eden. .c etc. etc. ' etcH “ ’’the first of the two one nape, from which it would appear thav^ !&gt; ' the Dahana proper ends sonewhere - perhaps a considerable distance - to the north of hr. Philby’s 1932 route. It is true that the iiunailah through which It. Philby passed is described by him at page 344 as 'generally regarded as a southerly continuation of the Unhna' and on the map as 'sand tract similar to uabna', but it in clear from his words that it is not called Janna (Uahana) -nd both the statement at page 3-14 and. the map indicate that there is a ;ap between the Dahana and the fiumailah. thus it is possible that there is a considerable portion of the area desired by the Iraq Petroleum Company (i.e. any area in daudi arabia lying east of longitude 48 east and not already covered by a concession granted go some other company) v/hich lies between the southern boundary of the California Arabian standard 0i 1 Con ■&gt; an; c onc :• g s Ioi the Violet Line as no 'i Ci n- ' - Government* .iCi oho \I iolet Line - still more ho latest offer of His Majesty’s 3. Even if the contention set forth in paragraph 2 above is comec^ I ^oald not suggest that the Iraq Petroleum Company snould be encouraged to anplg for the unallotted area. On the contrary, I agree that such an application at this moment would increase ion Saudis desire to secure a larger share in the Riba' al Khali than it suits His him and perhaps complicate mvoGby's Government to concede to the issue by inspiring him with the suspicion thatHHis Haje: ty , s Government have been biassed all along by she belief that there might be oil in the area in dispate. 4.

Longriyg proponed to push o: with the concessions over Abu Dhabi, Unseat and the Aden Protectorate. It is assumed that if any such - concession is obtained before a frontier agreementagreement with Ibn Sand is concluded, it will not be worded in such a way as to i iply a unilateral decision as to any area in dispute. Ireco wine, her ever, that this is only a reasonable attitude so lor ’ as an agreement is arrived at j. airly soon, and tlv-t it is not desirable that procrastination should leave a potential oil area either undeveloped or exoosed to the encroachment o:i an American company in virtue of a vague concession from Ibn Sand. fho prospects for the negotiations, when they are reopened, are not encouraging. Ibn Sand has been ;iven satisfaction on several points which he had much at heart - the manumission of slaves, the equality o Arabic with iihglish in the treaty of decida, difficulties at Bahrain, and the control of the Le 'ation dicpcnsr ry and medical staff; on the frontier quest ions it ic di ficult for us to wo .s&gt; farther than wa have rir ac'; one; Riad Bey I-Iamza's enquiries about a loan net v-ith a diacou • ;ing recaption in the City; in t ie matter of the hejan ’ailv/a,'/ no solution is in si ;ht; and in t ie three other major questions - Kuwait Blockade, landing facilities for aeroplanes, and the debt due to His Majesty's Government, we want something from Ibn Said and have nothing to offer in return. The only important factor that I can find or. v:;e other aide is Ibn Baud's undoubted desire to remain on good terras with His Majesty's Government and it may bo that having accepted aeroplanes and technical assistance from the Italians as a gift he may feel called upon to be accommodatin ' towards His Majesty’s Government to enphasise ais impartiality. Hie li station which the doubt about the frontiers nieces unon the search for oil and minerals may also serve as an inducement to speed in negotiation.

I now transmit a full srmary of statements which he maae to me in the course of a co.nversation on February 18th. The collapse of his motor transport ana later, heavy floods, delayed his return so long that he haa only a few hours in Jedaa before iesr-fng for Mecca for the pilgrimage, but during that short time he called at the legation and he talked freely about his journey. 2. As I anticipated, Mr. Philby was in his most heroic Prometheus mood. Inaeed, he was even more difficult than I haa expected, for to his desire to bring the light of science to mankind is now aadea a quite ferocious in tention to expose the alleged duplicity of His Majesty's Government towards the Arabs of the Peninsula. He v*sev*;a that the second part o^ this programme uas aaded only under the provocation which he considers he received froi the Aden authorities. I a in not enter upon a discussion of the pledges given or allegedto have been given in respect of Arab independence. I haa never studiea tne McMahon correspondence closely from the point of view of the Arabian peninsula, and in any car^it would be unwise to treat Mr. Philby as the protagonist of the Arab claims. Moreover I had in hand the less nebulous argument that Shabwa lay outside the extreme limits ever claimed by the /Sat ItSaadi Government, Mr. Philby’s attitude towards that fact is sho,vn in paragraph 6 of the enclosed record. He professes to demand independence for the Arabs in the Arabian peninsula without regard to the Saudi demands, of which he however claimed to be fully aware. He informed me that he had on his maps the two proposed frontiers in the south, the British and the Saudi. In that case he was aware before he set out for Shabwa that it lay beyond the limits claimed by the Saoadi Government, 3. Mr. Philby is unable to see that he treated Ibn Saud badly in obtaining an escort for topographical work and explora tion in Saudi Arabia and using it, unknown to his patron, to enter territory outside Saudi Arabia. As to the Aden authorities he regards their claim to Shabwa as a trespass on territory which was abandoned by His Majesty’s Government in favour of Arab independence in the McMahon correspondence. In that correspondence His Majesty’s Government agreed to recognise n the independence of the Arab countries” within the limits laid down by the Sherif Hussein, which included the whole of the Arabian peninsula except Aden and, possibly, the Arab states on the Persian Gulf, but they added the proviso: ’’without prejudice to the existing treaties with Arab chiefs.” Probably Mr. Philby would say that His Majesty’s Government had no treaty then and have none now with the Arab chief of Shabwa, and regard that as the last word on a subject of great practical and legal complexity. I ass one that the observations of the Chief Commissioner of Aden on Mr. Philby’s claims will be recorded in due course. At first sight it seems to me that there is just enough truth in Mr. Philby’s contention to afford a moral shelter behind which he can indulge his personal tastes and feelings and interests to the full. Mr. Philby’s claim that from the political point of view 4-4- mapa, viz., Sanaa and Thamut in the liadhramaut hinterland and Shiaur and 'Dadhau in the hinterland of Oman, are not on Fuad Bey’a liat of Murra well a, have never been claimed by the Saudi Government by name, and, according to the information in Thomas* a n Arabia Felix', lie to the aouth of the Rub* al Khali and in the steppe countiy v/hich rises from the rim of the desert to the crests of the coastal range and are frequented almost exclusive ly by til bes to whom Ibn Saud lays no claim. It is unlikely that Mr. Philby has collected any better information on this point than Bertram Thomas, who passed through the territory in question and halted at Shisur, but he may make it more difficult for Ibn Saud to renounce his claim, by representing the tribes thereabouts as entirely beyond the control of the authorities in the coastal states but ready and willing to submit to Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is so much more a statesman than Mr.Phil by that I am hopeful that nothing Mr. Philby can say will influence him in this matter, the more so as having repudiated responsi bility for the expedition he can hardly quote the results to his own advantage. I am more anxious lest the &amp;fcpearance of the promised attack 0 n His Majesty’s Government in Mr. Philby»s next book should drag the question of the smaller Arab states in the Arabian peninsula into the vortex of controversy about the McMahon correspondence. I do not propose t 0 engage in a dispute on Pan-Arab politics with Mr. Philby, nor to continue the discussion about his visit to Shabwa. The views of His Majesty’s Government have been conveyed to the Saudi Government, and Mr.Philby has also been informed of those views, and the matter had better, I suggest, be left there. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure /5 nr eittlogure to Aden, Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad and Busnire. I have the honour t o be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (ad.) R.W.BULLARD.SUM!£ARY of statements made by Mr, Pnilby about his expedition to Shabwa and beyond, in the course of a conversa tion which he had with His Majesty’s Minister on the 18th Pebriary 1937. 1. It was ^uite true that Ibn Saud had nothin to do with t he expedition beyond instructing all local officials to assist him, Mr. Philby had defrayed all the expenses himself (and they had turned out to be much heavier than he had expected), though he had financed himself by drawing on Saudi treasuries, where they existed, and refunding the advances through his firm in Jedda. The object of the journey was purely scientific, and he had in fact collected a great mass of information which he hoped would be of use to science, and had established the position of over a hundred points. Throughout the expedition the only connection he had had n th Ibn Saud was that as a matter of courtesy whenever he was within reach of a Saudi telegraph station he sent a telegram to the King reporting the date of arrival and the probable date of departure. 2. To show that the journey had originally no concern with politics he could state that he had written all he had intended to s ay about the Nadhramaut before he started back from Shibam, i.e., before the breakdown of one of his cars compelled him to go to Mukalla to try t 0 get a new back-axle. The chapter was colourless, in spite of the fact that he had 'seen a lot of things' about which he might lave written. But after the reception he received when he applied to the Resident at Aden for assistance he had changed his mind. Having been attacked he proposed to defend himself, and he would add chapters to his forthcoming book which would tell the world the /- 2 - the facte about the Aden Protectorate. He was prepared to give His 'tajesty's Minister all these facts, but he also proposed to give them to the Saudi Government. 3. The criticism directed against his visit to Shabwa was entirely unjustified. His journey was on all fours with that of Bertram Thomas across the Rub* al Khali. He was quite r ight in claiming that apart from the Hadhramaut his journey lay in unexplored, undemarcated territory. To claim Shabwa and those parts for the Aden Protectorate //as fantastic, for no protection was afforded. Nor could the Aden authorities claim the virtue of leaving the people thereabouts to manage their own affairs, for they bombed them. The Aden attitude towards Shabwa was exactly like that of the Italians towards Walwal a t the beginning of the Italo_T3thiopian dispute, and British policy was no more honest than that of Italy had been. The British were trying to expand at the expense of the Arabs. 4. His policy remained what it had always been, vi z ., to try to obtain for the Arabs what they were promised early in the Great War. He had challenged His Majesty’s Government to publish the promises made then (the McMahon correspondence), but with their habitual cowardice they had refused. There were plenty of copies in Arabic to be had, but the English correspondence ought to be published. He would tell His Majesty’s Minis ter a ’’Secret*: he used to possess copies of the correspondence in English, given to him by T.B.Lawrence, but they were stolen from him by a clerk of his in Jedda. 5. He was interested to hear (for the first time) that the King of the Yemen had protested to Ibn Baud, alleg ng that the expedition had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. He wondered how the King had heard about it. In point of fact he had not gone to Marib, but had taken photographs and bearings from a he ight /height from which it was visible# (Mr.Philby evaded, or at least did not answer, the question whether the height in question was in Yemen territory). 6# No, it was not quite correct to say that he was asking for more for Ibn Saud than Ibn Saud was asking for himself, though it was near the truth. What he wanted was the establishment of the promised Arab independence in the Arab Peninsula and the elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with the promises. Mr. Phil by claimed to know all about the British and Saudi proposals for the s ot&amp;thern frontier of Saudi Arabia and to have the two lines marked on maps in his possessi on. Vhen His Majesty’s Minister said that in that case he must have known that Shabwa lay well to the south of the proposed Saudi line, he said that the position of Shabwa on the map was a long way out, but he did not deny that Shabwa was even farther to the south than the mapshows and therefore at a greater distance from the extreme limits claimed by Ibn Saud than appeared from the map.No. of 1937.

British Legation, J edda. 27th March, 19 37 Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a record made by Mr. Rendel of a discussion which we had with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and Shaikh Hafiz Wahba on March 19th, about the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia in and near the region of qatar. The record is accompanied by two sketch maps made by Mr. Rendel, viz. (l) the Jabal Naksh area, (2) Khor al Odeido 2« In accordance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram No.l of January 4th I had for some time been discuss ing the southern frontier with Fuad Bey, as neither His Majesty’s Government nor Ibn Saud felt abl-® to give way about either Jabal Uaksh or Khor al Odeid. The information collected by Mr. Rendel on the spot seemed however to be so clear, that I fully agreed with him that it would be worth while to make an effort during his stay in Jedda to come to an agreement on this the most difficult part of the frontier in the hope that this potential cause of friction, perhaps dar^erous friction in time of crisis, might be cleared out of the way. The history of the case subsequent to the discussion recorded by Mr. Rendel is given in my despatches Ho.41 of March 23rd and Ho.46 of March 27th, but for convenience of reference I summarise the relevant portions of those despatches here. 3. At an interview with Ibn Saud on March 21st Mr.Rend el made an appeal for a settlement of the Jabal Haksh - Khor al Odeid -Sufuk (Safaq) portion of the frontier# Ibn Saud repeated / The Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden,MC.,MP., etc., etc., etc.- 2 - repeated his familiar argument that the tfhole of the coast used to belong to his ancestors and that the ^resent rulers wduld not deny it. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty's Govern ment in the Hadda ^Agreement, but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he coold not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik ('Uraiq) which was in the nufud . The maps which were at hand were examined, but none showed Araik. I said that unless my memory was at fault I had seen a map on which Araik was shown to the south of Jabal ITaksh: if that were so there would no longer be any disagreement on this point. Ibn Saud then turned to Khor al Ode id and said that in claiming it for Saudi Arabia he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own. Ho one else could govern that region. ,Vhen crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 4. on my return to the Legation I found that in the only map that showed Araik (that enclosed in Mr. Rend el’s letter Ho. E. 228/35/91 of January Idth 1936 to Sir Andrew Ryan) it was in fact shown just north of Q*sr al Salwa i.e. exactly where we have proposed that the boundary should run. I also consulted telegram No. 92 which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sent to the India Office on February 1st 1936, which supports this view. I therefore wrote to Shaikh ITusuf Yas in suggesting tnat the definition of the boundary given by the King left Jabal Haksh to Qatar. His reply, which is given as an enclosure to my despatch Ho.46 dated 27th March, if confused in some respects, is clear enough in denying that the King admitted that Qatar included Jabal Haksh and in implying that the boundary rune between /-3- between Jabal Xaicnia Dukhan and Jabal Kaksh, I have since discussed the matter with Shaikh Yusuf Yas in as well as one can discuss a subject with a man who admits tnat he knows nothing about it. He quotes 5*ua4 ! s statement of April 3rd 1935, a copy of which was sent to you in Sir Andrew Rian’s despatch No. 109 of April 7th 1935, and declares that that letter still expresses the King’s views. Now this statement ass unes, in its first paragraph, that there is an area lying between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh, and although we know, from Mr. Rendel’s observations, that Jabal Naksh is only a part of the Jabal Dukhan which is slightly higher than the adjacent crest, this difference in our premises will never be settled by looking at maps in Jedda, and I feel that if the argument is to be pursued profitably, responsible representa tives of the two sides will have to visit the spot together and to come to an agreement about the physical features. 5 I have however suggested in my telegram No.24 dated 25th March that it is not desirable to try to force a settle ment on the frontier question Qt the present moment. If what seemed to be the overwhelming evidence obtained by Mr.Rendel had convinced Ibn Saud it would have been an excellent thing, but the note which forms the second enclosure to my despatch No.46 dated March 27th shows clearly that he is not convinced and that the frontier on the east remains a veiy sore point with him. Given this feeling, and the difference of opinion about the physical features in the Jabal Naksh, I feel that to continue to urge Ibn Saud at present to accept our point of vie would be useless, and would go far to counteract the good effect of the conversations which took place during Mr.Rendel’s visit. In any case I think that no decision to continue to press /pres 3 for the frontier #e want should be taken until you have had an opportunity to consider the matter in the light of the recent conversations, and I have recommended this in my above- mentioned telegram No.24. In the meanwhile I have sent replies to tne two communications on this and kindred subjects which formed the enclosures to my despatch No,46, but I have foreborne to press our claim. Copies of these replies are enclosed. In one I acknowledge receipt of Ibn Saud's complaint against being hemmed in by His Majesty^ Government on the east, in the other I transmit to the Saudi Government the information about the position of Sufuk which has been received in Bahrain telegrams Nos.64 and 65 dated March 23rd and 24th, and give my opinion that there is some serious discrepancy between the Saudi information and our own as to the physical features in the Jabal Naksh region. 6. It may be said that as we have made up our minds about Jabal Na^sh and Khor al Ode id Ibn Saud has nothing to gain by delay while we stand to lose in that a cause of friction is left which might lead to trouble at a time of crisis. I do not think that either of these arguments is completely sound. Ibn Saud msy feel that he cannot hope to obtain either of the two coveted areas, but that is not the same as signing the places away in writing and thus belittling himself in the eyes of the Arab world. As to the danger likely to result from an undetermined frontier, I suggest that the fear of such a danger can be exaggerated. If there should ever be war in which His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia were on opposite sides, it is not a description of the frontiers on paper that would prevent Ibn Saud from trying to advance to the shores of the Persian Gulf at various points, while if Ibn Saud were on our side or neutral he would not disturb the status quo. Every thing now suggests that he realises that his interests and those of His Majesty’s Government are bound up with each other,-5- and if we are unable to giye him all that he aake for we should at least, I think, refrain from pressing him to make an admission that we can do without. 7. In order that our claim may not go by default we might suggest that a joint commission should visit the Jabal Naksh - Araik area and examine the physical features on the spot. It is beginning to be a little late in the year for such a task, and we might suggest the end of the year as a suitable time. Then I would urge that we should examine carefully the possibility of giving Ibn Saud a royalty on ary oil that may be struck in or near Jabal Naksh on the pretext that the oil-bearing strata must run partly under his terri tory. In my despatch No.38 E dated 11th March 1937 on the finances of Saudi Arabia I stressed the poverty of this country and the strain that will be placed upon Ibn Saud if the search for oil and minerals in his territory continues to be unsuccessful and oil should be discovered, as it has been at Bahrain, in the territory of some minor Shaikh lixe the oxiaikh of Qatar. Anything that can reasonably be done to reduce this risk should be done. 8. Fran correspondence going back to 1904 of which copies h a ve been received from Bushire it is clear that the Government of India have always regarded IQior al Ode id as belonging to Abu Dhabi. On the other hand it seems equally clear that tne Shaikh of Abu Dhabi never exercised any authority there then and Ibn Saud claims that it is he who exercises authority thei e no /, though it seems that the population is very scanty, if indeed the area contains any inhabitants at all. But even if i t were possible to induce the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to give up IChor al Odeid to Ibn Saud I doubt whether the transfer would /, c ^ -6- would be worth the making, since it would not give Ibn Saud the port he needs, and we should have made a political sacrifice without gaining the advantage which I think we stand to gain from any improvement in Ibn Baud’s economic position• 9. copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushir e.

South Eastern Arabian Frontiers. 3ir Reader Bullard and I called on Shaikh /us of iasin on March 19th to discuss the frontier question. Shaikh Hafiz 'Vahha and a secretary from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Muhammad Shaikho) were also present. Shaikh ai ’- interpreted with Sir Reader Bullard's assistance. 1. 2. Sir Reader began by explaining that not long ago, according to the records he had seen, there had been some thirty questions outstanding between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. These had now happily been reduced - as regards questions of major importance - to three:- i.e. the Eastern and southern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia, the Transjordan frontier and the Kuwait Blockade. He explained that I had taken the opportunity of my present journey to make a special study on the spot of the first of these three questions, and suggested that the occasion of my visit to Jedda might use fully be taken to discuss it in the light of my invest iga- tions. 3. Shaikh Yusuf replied that, though certain questions might still be outstanding, no question at issue could make any difference to the firmness of Anglo-Saudi friendship. 4. I explained that while it was happily true that Amglo-Saudi friendship rested on so solid a foundation that such local issues were unlikely ever to disturb it, it was nevertheless wise to take the opportunity of the calmness and cordiality of our friendship to clear up all outstanding points and eliminate a&amp; far as ve could all potential causes of local friction. An unsettled frontier, as had been shown over and over again elsewhere, was always a potential danger. It // - 2 - It would surely be well then to get the matter finally settled and out of the way as soon as possible, 5. With this end in view I had taKen the opportunity of the King* s invitation to me to visit Saudi Arabia to go into the whole matter again with renewed thoroughness, I had dis cussed it with the British authorities in the Persian Gulf, I had gone through the relevant archives at the British ■Residency, and, in order to satisfy myself personally that we were not making any exaggerated or unjustified claims, I had, in company with Colonel Powle, Colonel Loch and Captain de Gaury, flown over and round all the disputed points of the frontier on the northern section of the line, particularly the Jabal Naicsh and the Khor al Ode id* I confessed that I had hoped that the facts would prove such as to enable us to offer some further compromise in regard to these two points. Our object, as the Saudi Government well knew, was to meet King Ibn Saud^ wishes to the utmost possible extent. But un fortunately iby hopes of finding our case ill founded or of devising a means .f suggesting some compromise over the mere difficult parts of the line had not been realised. II. 6. I then suggested that we should consider the various sections of the frontier in detail and that we should begin with the Jabal Uaksh, I showed Shaikh Yusuf Yas in our latest map of the atar Peninsula, and also a sketch map and elevation of the Jabal Naksh and surrounding district which I had drawn myself as a result of my observations from the air (copy attached). I left him a duplicate of thin sketch, which showed unmistakably that the Jabal Haksh is geographically an integral part of the Jabal Dukhan and of the Qatar Peninsula. I pointed out that the obvious line for the frontier of the peninsula ran across the flat sand south of the Jabal, and I developed the /-3- the obvioua general arguments against establishing unnatural and unsound frontier lines. 7. ihai^h Yusuf Yasin replied that the King could legitimately claim a great deal more than the Jabal Nahsh. All the tribes in this area really owed him allegiance. But he was nevertheless prepared to abandon his rights over the greater part of the area, if the Jabal Naksh remained in his possession. 8. I answered that this might perhaps have been an argument if he vere claiming the whole of tetar. But this was not practical politics. /e had, by our treaties, guaranteed Qatar and the Trucial Shaikhs against absorption by any other Power, and King Ibn Sa’^i had recognised and accepted this situa'cion by the Treaty of Jedda. The integrity of Qatar must therefore be maintained, and we really could not reason ably be expected to accept any claim which would involve its dismemberment. Had any concession in this area been at all possible I could assure Shaikh Yusuf Yasin that I should have been the first person to urge it. 9. I added that, in all the early stages of this dispute there had never been any question of a Saudi claim to the Jabal Kaksh. The claim indeed, nhich had only been put forward by Fuad Bey Humza at an advanced stage of the controversy, had come as a complete surprise to us. Was it worth then risking a settlement for it ? III. 10. We then passed on to the second part of the frontier i.e. that between Saudi Arabia and the Shaikhdom of Abu Dhabi. This brought us to King Ibn Saud’s claim to the Khor al Ode id. 11. I explained that here also I had very greatly hoped that /that something might have been done to meet King Ibn Saud^ wishes. But my reading of the archives of the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf had shown that the claim of Aim Dhabi to this area was far older and stronger than I had imagined and that the Khor al Odeid had been formally recognis ed by us for the past sixty years at least - long before there was any question of $ny Saudi claim - as the property of the Shaikhdom of Abu Dhabi. 12. I then gave Shaikh Yusuf Yas in a summary of some of the relevant history, notably the correspondence of 1878, 1881, 1890 and 1906. (See attached note, of which Sir Reader Bullard gave the Shaikh a copy later) and read him the second paragraph of Sir Percy (then Major) Cox's letter of December 1st 1906 to Shaikh £aid bin Khalifa of Abu Dhabi, which Shaikh Hax iz fahba translated and which Muhammad Shaikho took down. 13. Shaikh Yusuf Yas in and Shaikh Hafiz Wahba attempted to argue that King Ibn Saud's recognition by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jed da of our special treaty relations with the Trucial Shaikhs did not imply any recognition of any particular frontiers; but I pointed out that our recognition of a valid claim by such a Shaikh to any particular place formed part of our treaty relations with that Shaikh, and must be regarded as covered by Ibn Saud's recognition of our special relations with him. 14. I added that as regards the Khor al Odeid itself King Ibn Saud would not be losing anything of any value. The sea here, as I had seen from the air, was a mass of reefs, while the entrance to the Khor was so iong, narrow, winding and shallow, that I could not conceive of its being any use uv one as a harbour. But to us and to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi the continued possession of this area had a different importance, which it could not possess for King Ibn Saud. jfe did not want the Khor al Odeid as a harbour; but the land immediately /-5- immedlately to the west of it afforded the only land passage between Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and it was far more important for Abu Dhabi to retain the caravan route &amp;nd to keep a coterminous frontier v/ith Qatar, than for King Ibn Saud, who already had good potential harbours at such places as Has Tanura, to obtain a new fragment of sea coast of very problematical value. But in any case, as King Ibn 3aud v/ould be the first to realise, we could not go back on the categorical undertaking contained in Sir Percy CQx f s letter of 1906. IV. 15. We then considered the next section of the frontier i.e. from the point south west of the Sabkhat Matti where it turns 3ast, to the point where it joins the frontier of Muscat and Oman. I said that in regard to this sector tne sit at ion seemed to me rather more hopeful. In their note of April 3rd 1935 the Saudi Government had agreed to the Sabkhat Matti and the line of wells described on the latest edition of Hunters map as the Qufa Liwa remaining to Abu Dhabi. .All we wanted to be sure of was that the wells of sufuk, which according to our information lay on the caravan route from Abu Dhabi to Doha, should remain, together with the caravan route itself, within Abu Dhabi territory. The discrepancy between our line and the Saudi line in this area, which was in any case slight, was due to Sufuk being marked where it was on Hunter’s map. But there was some reason to believe that this marking was inaccurate, and that Sufuk wells and the caravan route really lay rather nearer to the coast. I had hoped to be in posses sion of accurate information on this point in time to clear up the matter with Shaikh Yusuf Yas in at once. Unfortunately we had not been able to find the wells during our flight, and I had just learnt that it would be impossible for Colonel Loch to complete the further investigation he had at once embarked- 6 - upon before well on in the next week. The point ought not however to lead to serious difficulty since we were really- agreed on the main principles involved. 16. Shaikh Yusuf said that Sufuk -was a Murra well. I replied that we could not accept these progressive claims for the Murra tribe. Ye had agreed that Banaiyan was a Hurra well and given up Abu Dhabi’s claim to it in consequence. But adl our information showed that the normal Murra dir a ended well to the south west of Sufuk wherever it was. If the Saudi Government always claimed as a Murra well the next well beyond the lost well we had conceded, there would be no reason why they should not eventually claim Muscat town. I made as much play as I could of our concession at Banaiyan, in order to show how ready ve had been to concede a point whenever careful enquiry showed that the facts were against us. But this was not so now. V. 17. After a good deal of further discussion in which the historical and legal aspects of the question/ were touched upon, only to be set aside in favour of a more practical solution on the basis of the situation now existing, Sir Reader Bullard explained that he had at first expressed the view that it would be best to leave discussions on this part of the frontier in abeyance for the present. But the investigation I had made into the matter had led him to change his mind and he now agreed that it would be far better to get the matter settled and disposed of as quickly as possible. 18. I suggested that, although we had at first proposed that the frontier question should be de^lt with as a whole, we were now more likely to make progress if we took the various see tors of the frontier one by one. The sector between Saudi Arabia and Muscat involved consultation with the Sultan of Muscat, / Tflft-'Hirr rVo 5 Muscat, which was not yet completed and would involve further loss of time. The sector between Saudi Arabia and the Hadhra- maut area of the Aden Protectorate was still being reinvestiga ted by the Aden authorities, and I could not yet say what might emerge. Eut for the northern sector, i 0 e. the frontier with qatar and Abu Dhabi, we no;/ had practically all the material we could need, and I greatly hoped therefore that a settlement of it could be reached without further delay. I felt sure that, after all that had passed, it would now be best to tackle this frontier bit by bit. 19. Shaikh Yuguf did not demur to this suggestion but said he must refer the whole matter to the King. He would do this at once and let us know the result as soon as possible. 20. In conclusion I again urged the desirability of reaching an early settlement. I pointed out that three years ago the position had been that we were taking our stand on the strictly legal position and claiming the 'blue' and rt violet H lines. As a result of much very hard work and of our great desire to go to the utmost limits to satisfy King Ibn Saud we had eventually agreed to concede a very large area to him and had finally put forward the '“Riyadh Line'. I showed Shaikh Yusuf these lines on the map and emphasised the extent to which vve had modified our attitude in order to show our friendship for the King. But what was the position of the Saudi Govern ment ? They had put forward, on April 3rd 1935, a line, which I showed Shaikh Yusuf on the map, from which they had never retreated an inch, I was no supporter of a policy of bargain ing, and I did not believe in progressive concessions. But now that the new lines were so close to each other as to approximate within a few miles, I felt the time had really come for the Saudis to make some concession too and reciprocate the conciliatory / -- 8 - conciliatory spirit we ourselves had shown# There w?is really now very little between us; but, as Shaikh Yusuf would realise from what I had said earlier in the discussion we really could make no further concession* sir Reader warmly endorsed this appeal and tne conversation concluded with a renewed promise from the Shaikh to refer the whole matter to the King without delay# (signed) G.W.Rendel.

I am sending a translation of that note to the foreign Office immediately and I am sure that it will be considered by His Majesty’s Government, li^e all the comnunicat ions from His Majesty, with close and sympathet attention.

(Dear 3haikh Yuauf Yasin,) ,Vhen we had our discussion about the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia on March 19th, Mr. Rendel said that he was sorry that he had not been a ble to locate the Sufuk (Safaq) wells in the course of his recent aeroplane visit to that area, but that we expected to receive the details soon. I am now able to inform you that Safaq has been located accurately. It has been found by careful observations that it is tw&amp;lve miles due south of Has Asqhsila. If you have Bertram Thomas’s book 'Arabia Fel ix** and will look at the large map at the end of the book, Safaq should be placed just west of the initial letter *3* in the name rt Sabkhat Matti*. This means that the distance of Safaq from the coast is only about one-third of that usually shown in the maps, including the large map of Arabia of which I h a d the pleasure of giving you two copies on the 24th March. This letter is sent to complete the record of th, discussion. I take the opportunity to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 23rd, in which you explain the reference which His Majesty the Ming made to Araik, ?rom this letter, t na from the letter to which you referred in our conversation on the 24th March, viz. the letter written by Shaikh Mu&amp;d Bey Hamza to Sir Andrew Ryan on April 3rd 1935, I have come to the conclusion that the picture which the Saudi authorities have in their mind of the nature of the physical features in those parts is quite different from the one which we have formed as £he result of our inquiries and of the observations made by Mr, Renddl and other British officials His Excellency ° n ^ Shaikh Yusuf Yasin.on the spot* However, at present I do not wish to do more than record my opinion that a misunderstanding exists on this point.

But »ve think, subject to your views, that it might be as well if a communecation were addressed to the Sultan mentioning, infr-jr alia s that His Majesty's Government have taken note of the fact that while he cannot state precisely the limits of hie claims, he at any rate lays no claim to any territory beyona the points D, B, G, and H (the points C and i do not really affect him}. This will serve to narrow down any controversy which mi.Jit j oss^bly arise when, find if, the r4 new oil concession recently granted to Petroleum Goneossione Limited comes to be exploited, and may help us to secure an eventual definition of the inland boundary oi the Puitanate. 4. incidentally, the use of loiters of the alphabet ior describing potential -rentier* is convenient enough in its way, but if tn© earn© letter is u&amp;eu at different t-moe for diifersnt geogra ,acal points owing to changes in the suggested frontier line, the letters are apt to b come a source of confusion. u&amp; th.rsfore su goat that these point® should be fixed/ .

Reported activity of Standard Oil Company of California near ^asr el Salwa nas necessitated renewed consideration of proposal for unilateral declaration by His ’Majesty's aovernment to Ibn Saud defining tneir view of northern sector of frontier* such a declaration now seems inevitable, in view of forestalling possible encroachments by United States Company (e) on J.atar territory already granted by Shaikh of %atar to Petroleum Concessions Limited according to map attached to concession, or (b) on territory (e.g. round Khar el Oaeid) already officially recognised by His Majesty‘s Government as belonging to Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and thus covered by prospecting license granted by him to same Company. 2 But it is important that this declaration should not nave the appearance of an ultimatum and it has accordingly been decided to combine it with invitation to Ibn Saud on tne lines suggested in paragraph wo*7 of Bullard’s despatch Ho.47, for despatch of joint topographical missionmi 3 s ion to disputed area# to establish e*act location of main pnysical features t ^sucn as tne Jebei ^aJcan, SufuK Wells and otner points mentioned in rtis majesty's uorernment's definition of tnis sector of tne frontier. 3* You snould tnerefore unless you see strong objection now address tne Haudi Government on the following lines. his Majesty's Government understand from recent reports tnat the Standard Oil Company of California ( California Arabian Oil r Company ) are believed to be V opefrting in tne neignbournood of qasr el Balwa; views of his *jaj esty's Government witn regard to the frontier question in tnis area nave already been communicated to King Ibn Baud and His Majesty's Government are still prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on tne lines they have indicated.

But matter is urgent and note should not be delayed more than a few days. 6.

The views of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the frontier in the said area have already h en communicated to His Majesty King Audul Aziz, ana his majesty’s Government are prepared to reopen negotiations for a set lement on the lines they have indicated. They assume that in the meantime no attempt will ue made uy tne California Arabian Company to pass tne line defined in tne latest proposals of His Majesty’s Government to his Majesty King AoauL Aziz so long as no finar agre merit nas oe-n leached as to that line. Since, however, there is some uncertainty as to trie precise position of certain of tne physical features concerned. His Majesty's Government propose that a joint Anglo- Saudi topographical mission should oe appointed to establish on tne spot the exact nature ana position of tnose features. To obviate misunderstanding I oeg to repeat tne relevant proposals oi His Majesty’s Government as made under tne first four headings of the note which Sir Andrew Ryan communicated to His Excellency Faud Bey at Riyadh on His Royal Highness The Minister for Foreign Affairs,'SM on Novemoer ^5tn 1 jo 5 (the reference can be fol owed on tne map of which two copies a ere ixanuea to His Excel ency Yusuf Yasin on March ^4tn,j, (r A straight line starting from a point on the coast of the Dohat-as-Salwa four miles to tne north east of the point on tne sea coast closest to Qasr-as- Salwa ana running aue south-east for ten miles.
