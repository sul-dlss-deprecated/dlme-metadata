Dear Sir Reference your demi-official letter dated /S September 1936, I am sure a trained operating room attendant will be/very useful asset in this hospital. At present no operations can be performed as the present compounder is too busy with disnensing and helping the dresser, to attend to an operating room. Regarding his pay I would suggest that he receive the same salary as the compounder viz. Rs.60/- per month and a s there are no quarters available tts.10/- for house rent. Later it may be possible to arrange a small remuneration from the Government of Bahrain as in the case of the compounder who receives Rs.20/- per month from this source. me regarding the utility of an attendant as you have described him. I an certain that Dr. Holmes will agree with Captain T. Hickinbotham I.A., Officiating Political Agent,w u €) Karachi. IB.9.36. 1k k Dr Eates the resident medical officer at the Civil Hospital here who I know personally tells me that he has an operation theartre orderly who is keen on coming to Bahrain. The man is well qualified and is cap able of assisting at a major operation in fact is better than most sisters* If you have a vacancy will you let me know what rate of pay he would recerv -ve and if you have no vacancy do you consider that it would be a wise act if we were to take the oppurtunity of obtaining a good man and take him on \AyV supemumery to the establishment with the intention of absorbing him when s a vacancy occurred. I could pay for him out of Funds.

It now transpires, however, that trie Bahrain Government have a vacancy for a trained operating room attendant, I should accordingly be most grateful if you would enquire from Doctor Bates whether the man is still available ana, if so, if he would please let me have details of his service, religion, qualifications, and approximate pay he expects by the next air mail* It is retiring from service with the Civil Hoppital Karachi anc who unlikely that the Bahrain Government wouad be prepareo to o offer moreoffer more than 80 rupees per mensem ■ nu It is of course, essential that he should e of unquestionable character.

No. 1113/1 Bahrain, January 7, 1937 / Dear Colonel Loch, With reference to the employment of a 'dresser' to attend His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad and give him injections. I under stand that the man from Karachi is not avail able. Owing to the unsatisfactory results of the latest examination I understand that Dr. Holmes considers it necessary that either he or his hospital dresser should give the injections until a regular man is obtained. I should be grateful if you could ask the Hon f ble the Political Resident if he would assist us in obtaining a suitable man as soon as possible. I think such a man could probably be got without difficulty from Baghdad. We are prepared to pay a salary of Rs 100/- per month with 30 days* leave per annum and deck passage every two years.

Please refer to your Express letter no.C/ld-4/11, dated tne 9tn January 1937, on tne subject of a Medical attendant for tne snaiim, wno would also be in cnarge of a travelling dispensary. 2. 1 nave talked the matter over witn Rooney, and ne is of opinion tnat for tne pay offered ^Rs. 100/- per mensem) tne Balirain government snould be able to get somebody witn higner qualifications tnan tne G ompo under-Dr ess er type suggested. Probably a retired Sub-Assistant Surgeon or Assistant Surgeon would be glad to add tnis pay to nis pension, especially if tne Bahrain (government were willing to add free quarters, or some otner increment, to tne pay, and a second class, instead of a deck, passage to India. If tne Banrain Government could get hold of a good man it would I tnink be well wortn their while to do this. 3. Rooney and I would write to India making enquiries for such an individual, but Rooney suggests, and I quite agree, that the best plan would be for the Bahrain Government to advertise in the Karachi and Bombay papers. The following is a suggested form: Wanted by the Banrain Government: An Assistant or Sub-Assistant Surgeon. Pay Ks.100/- per mensem. For further particulars apply to tne Adviser, Banrain Government, Banrain, Persian Gulf. 4.

No, C/463-4/11 Dated the Mth July 1938* I have been very worrifor the past week or two about Shaikh Sir Hamad*a health. He had a sort of para typhoid fever for about ten days, and although he haa re covered from this It has left him very weak. The natural result was that his diabetes got hold of him rather badly. 2. The Bahrain Petroleum Company made an- offer of either pert of their hospital or one of their air-cooled houses if Shaikh Hamad chose to go in 5 but at first he refused and various messages to him from myself and others had no effect. I myself thought that it might do him a great deal of good if he could be induced to go away, but I was advised that he was so weak that it would be dangerous for him to do so unless Dr. Holmes went with him. As there was little hope of in ducing him to agree to this, I decided to make one last per sonal effort to get him to accept the offer of an air-cooled house, and I saw him this morning. 3* After a fair amount of persuasion he finally agreed to make use of one of the air-cooled houses for a few daya. I am afraid I had to take your name in vain and say that you, like the rest of us including all the doctors, were very an xious that he should accept this offer, and this did the trick. In itself the air-cooling will be very good for him, for Sakhir is terribly hot in the afternoons, but what is more important is that the doctors will be able to look after his diet and his injections. We are all full of hope that as a result the old Shaikh will rapidly recover his ordinary health/- The Hon*hie Lieutenant-Colo _ Sir Trenchard Fowle^^CHr., CBE, Political Resident in the Persian Sulf f Bushire.— health and strength, and both Shaikh Abdullah end Shaikh Salman have expressed their great gratitude for the efforts that have been made. 4. I am rather afraid that when the news gets about there rna^qe objections from Petroleum Concessions Limited that the action taken is prejudicial to their interests as the Shaikhs will feel under a debt of /ratitude to the American Company,* but I did not think that this should be taken into considera tion as there was a very serious chance that he might go into a coma at any moment and die. Naturally I should have prefer red to arrange for him to go to some 'neutral' place, but no such place exists. Yours sincerely,G.T.C \} Telegram From Political Agent, Bahrain.

L. Ir 4 ^: - 'Z L^V-^L Xx HIb Highness Sheilch Sir Hamad hin f l8a al Khalifa is about 67 years old. A very delightful person, courteous, kind-hearted, and generous, he is an old-fashioned Arab, and owing to his age and to the effects of chronic diabetes he is not always particularly bright in Intelligence. He speaks no English, only Arabic. 2. Subjects which never fall to arouse animation are his visits to England, and his friendship with Ibn Baud who visited Bahrain this spring. He retains too a very active Interest in hawking and in hunting gazelle with saluqis, though nowadays he has to watch from a car. 3. Though he genuinely desires to promote the welfare of his people and strongly approves of the work now being done in Bahrain in the way of social services, i.e. public health, education, and so on, he is liable bo be some vhat forgetful about the details. Nevertheless, he is proud of the new hospital now approaching completion in Manamah (the principal town of Bahrain); he is anxious that education should improve, and - after many years of opposi* tlon - he is now eager to have his own sons taught English. He is intensely proud of the lead which Bahrain is giving to the Gulf, and Indeed to his old friend Ibn Baud, in progressive activities of this nature. 4. On subjects such as malaria control (a very serious problem in Bahrain) and the conservation of artesian water supplies, he is distinctly muddled, partly because he has a passion for drilling artesian wells - a compara tively recent innovation in Bahrain. This is by no means a purely selfish interest, for he genuinely desires that his people should have improved supplies of drinking water, while few would grudge him his delight in laying out new date gardens, were their irrigation better controlled. But he cannot be made to appreciate clearly the fact that unlimited drilling and the reckless abuse of artesianwells, which generally flow full bore 24 hours a day, must some day cause a serious - and possibly fatal - diminution of artesian 'water supplies, and will also multiply breeding- places for mosquitoes. On the first point he suffers from the curse of the Arabs, the inshallah complex - God will provide. On the second, he seems to feel that the recommendations of Major Afridi, who visited Bahrain last year to advise on malaria control, might well be put into effect without interfering ’with his pet hobby, ve are pro gressing slowly in our efforts to induce him to take a clearer view, but if His Excellency the Viceroy should think fit to advise careful thought and firm action in conserving the unquestionably limited water resources of Bahrain, His Highness would be greatly impressed. 5. His Highness has a profound love for his country, and it is ’with the greatest difficulty that we have induced him in the last two years to leave Bahrain during the hottest months of the year for his health's sake. He is immensely generous, though not always sufficiently discriminating in his beneficence. He is regarded with affection by the vast majority of the population, to all of whom he is at all times accessible. Towards the Doula (His Majesty's Government) his loyalty is magnificent, and he will at all times provide us with any facilities for which we may need to ask. Very properly he detests Hitler and Mussolini, and he takes a keen but vastly muddled interest in European politics. 6. Age and a chronic malady may have sapped his intelli gence, and I fear that his course is nearly run, but few people will leave a more pleasant memory than Sheikh Hamad of Bahrain. 7. He is accompanied in Simla by four of his sons, only one of whom, Sheikh Abdulla bin Hamad, speaks English. Sheikh Abdulla spent six months in England last year, and is moderately intelligent; but his knowledge of English is not extensive, and it is desirable to use short and simple sentences when he is interpreting.Mi P ! The Bahrain ShelXhdom. 7 c l' \f^c* y* it/ x since 1937. C Ruler - His Highness Sheikh Sir Hamad hin ’Isa al Khalifa. Adviser to the Sheikh. Mr. C.D.Belgrave, C.B.K. Gomposl tlon - The two main islands of Manamah and Muharraq, and several small islets and reefs; now increased by formal recognition of Bahrain sovereignty over the Hawa^ islands on the west coast of Qatar. Po pulation - (estimated). 125 # 000; town population mainly Sunni Arabs, and village population mainly Shia, known as Baharinah; considerable foreign population including several thousand domiciled Persians, Saudi Arabs, Omanis, and a few Iraqis. Ma j n Ifidustn ,^ (1) Oil (Bahrain Petroleum Company, American capital, 80 % of superior personnel British). (2) Pearling, now under a decline. Revenue. At present Rs 46-48 lakhs; main heads - *oil royalties Rs 32»35 lakhs and Customs Rs 10-11 lakhs. In Arab political theory the whole revenue accrues to the Ruler personally. In fact, he takes roughly l/3rd for himself and the Al Khalifat Family. 2. The main present activities in Bahrain may be briefly described as follows: (1) Creation of a reserve fund by Investment of Rs 15 la$hs annually from oil royalties. Total invested * to date Rs 48 lakhs® Total aimed at, roughly Rs 2£ crores; to allow the administration to continue on the present scale when oil royalties cease. (2) JFUbllc Health. (a) A large and well-equipped hospital is approach ing completion at Manamah, the main tom of Bahrain. Four small dispensaries are working in outside towns and villages. There is an English medical officer in charge, and a Scotch lady doctor, who is rapidly gaining the f wmMMconfidence of the Arab women. An English matron is also to he appointed when the hospital is ready# (b) An investigation was made in i938 by Major Afridl of the Malaria Institute for the purpose of advising on malaria control. A representative committee has now been appointed to put Major Afridi’s recommendations into effect. These will involve, inter alia, major projects for piped water supplies in the two main towns. (c) Drainage. Owing to lack of^11, surface drainage is often impossible. Experiments are being made now in vertical drainage, i.e. drilling short shafts to sandy strata. (3) Education. (a) A critical examination of the existing schools system was recently made by Mr. Adrian-Vailance of the Iraq Education Department (by private arrangement). His report is awaited, but his proposals are likely to involve radical reorganisation and a considerable increase in expenditure (at present just over fc 1 lakh). (b) Mr. Vallance has sent in privately a scheme for the creation of a Gulf college in Bahrain to provide higher education not only for Bahrain but also for neigh- bouring Arab States. This proposal has not yet been dis closed to His Highness, but has been submitted to the Political Resident for a preliminary decision by His Majesty *s Government and the Government of India on the question of policy. The proposal will probably reach Simla within a month# (c) Technical education is being steadily promoted in order to meet demands involved in the increased commercialisation of Bahrain and the Gulf in general. (d) Careful attention is devoted to female education which Includes instruction in household management and hygiene. (4) Agriculture. At present this is restricted to the cultivation of date palms and the growing of lucernerequired for feeding doinest&gt;ic 9nirn9.1s. (There is lit/tle natural grazing in Bahrain)* Vegetable crops are also nov receiving more attention. Improvements in methods of agriculture and the growing of new crotfi have been held up owing to the delay in obtaining a report xroni the Punjab expert who visited Bahrain in 1938. Meanwhile experimental work is in progress under the Adviser’s supervision, and the cultivation of sugar cane seems promising. His High ness has himself laid out new date gardens in the past year or two, but these unfortunately involve uneconomical use of artesian water. (5) nausawav and 3wlng-Brldge joining the two main Islands. The causeway is complete, and the bridge contract or (English) is to start work in October. The total cost will not be far short of Rs 12 lakhs, but the expenditure should be recouped over a period of 10-15 years by the levy of small tolls. This bridge will be of immense bene fit to Muharraq. (6) The conservation of water^ Indiscriminate drilling of artesian wells and wasteful usage are reducing the static head. Ve are having great difficulty in convincing the Ruling Family and others of the danger Involved, but steady pressure is being maintained in an effort to ensure restriction of drilling and control of flow. If successful, this will facilitate both mosquito control and the extended cultivation of pacing crops. (7) Creation of new industries^ Various lines seem promising, and in particular a cement industry« At present the Bahrain Petroleum Company are helping us in making a preliminary geological investigation free of charge. If this discloses the eiistence of the requisite raw materials in adequate quantities, we shall probably invoke the assistance of the British Cement Marketing Board to send us a technical expert to complete the investigation and to advise on plant, sales organisation, and so on. If this succeeds, other minor industriesn© •4- could be financed to Xutilise local resources such as mother-of-pearl shell, prawns, low-grade fish, etc. Other more distant prospects are the formation of a public trans port company, a Government machine shop, cold storage installation, etc. etc. So far we have^iscussed the cement investigation with His Highness. Other activities in Bahrain are the following : (1) Roval Navv . Owns a base at Juffair. At present this is mainly recreational, but may ultimately become a fuelling and stores base (including war stores). (2) R.A.F. Ve have just arranged the purchase of additional land renuired for the location of an R.A.F. flight from the Iraq Command on Muharraq island. This should be in operation in 1940. (3) Imperial Airways. 9 Five east-bound and five west-bound 'planes land at Bahrain weekly; and owing to the presence of oil companies in Bahrain, Hasa, and Qatar, Bahrain is one of the most paying stations on the wnole eastern route. Should plans develop for express services to India and beyond with aircraft flying 1000 to 1500 mile stages, the superiority of Bahrain politically and commercially to any other place as an intermediate stage between Egypt and India will presumably receive full weight* (4) Oil. Apart from Bahrain's own production (one million tons per annum) the islands lie midway between extensive fields in Hasa,(3audi Arabia), whence oil is now shipped to Bahrain for refining, and Qatar where there are high hopes of finding oil. Further to the south, explora tion should begin next cold weather in and behind the Trucial Coast States. Bahrain's central position in this rapidly expanding and vital industry renders it a key-point politically find commercially 0 f—mGen er al,,. The population Is generally content, lazy, inefficient and of poor physique - the last due to malaria and mal nutrition in the past. The standard of living is improving with increased prosperity, and with it there is already a noticeable improvement in physique in part of the population.The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to !• His Majesty* s 3eojcetary of State for India, London* 2* ‘fhe Secretary to the GoveraBOiit of India, External Jiffairs Department, Simla* 3.

To The Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre . i: emo randum I request sanction to my travel by air from Bahrain to Delhi en route to Simla on the 26th and 27th July 1939. 2. I had hoped to be able to fly from Bahrain to Lahore in a Royal Air Force aircraft and thus avoid any expenditure against Gulf funds, but unfortunately this arrangement fell through. Political Agent, BahrainConfidential lb D.O. No. Z/2-4/11 Ziarat, the 7th August 1939. Just a line to let you know how things went in Sinla. I got there on Friday the 28th and stayed the night with Laithwalte prior to the arrival of His Highness on the 29th. Unfortunately the Viceroy went off on his monsoon tour on Saturday — the very day that His Highness arrived. As he was going to be away for over a fortnight there seemed to be little point in my staying all that time, especially as it meant rather a bad breakdown in my office arrangements, and with the approval of Laithwaite and Caroe I left according to plan. I recorded two notes, one about His Highness per sonally and the other about present doings in Bahrain to faci litate any interview that His Excellency may give to the Shaikh. I have also coached Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad in the English phrases likely to be necessary in discussions between the Viceroy and His Highness, so I hope that all will be well. 2. His Highness very rapidly tired of Simla, as I rather feared he would, and after three days began enquiring about train /- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. / / /- 2 - nl train times and shipping dates• I therefore wrote privately to Laithwaite asking if it would be possible for the Viceroy to give His Highness an interview two or three days after his return to Simla l*e. about the 17th August and to invite His Highness to dinner a week later. This would serve to keep t e old Shaikh there for a reasonable length of tine. The climate is suiting him very well indeed and I arranged some trips for hiirii and odd tea parties and so on in order to reduce his boredom. He is dining with the Governor of the Punjab one night this week. 3. I went round to see the General Staff about machine guns, and by a tremendous stroke of luck managed to get a dozen V.Bs for Bahrain more or less over the counter. Apparently Nepal had been promised some and wrote in, while I was in Simla, that they did not want them, so I snatched some of these. It is quite possible, I think, that Foreign may be able to get the balance required for the Gulf without undue delay, but of course I cannot guarantee this and it is merely a private opinion. 4. Ziarat is very pleasant indeed, particularly after Simla with its constant rain and ten yards 1 visibility.

He thanks you for the messages. He says that he likes Simla. He is sorry that you had an unpleasant hourney. But H.H. is extremely happy that you are bringing the machine guns for his Government. When he heard that Quetta is hot he said he was glad that he did not go there. I gave your complimentary messages, he sends his salaams. He asked me to say that he is in good health but when I read out to him the passage that for his sake, for the sake of his people and for the sake of friendship he should not return too soon, he said atonce, ’’our health is, alhamdilillah, much better and our people themselves want me to return soon. But inshallah we shall be staying in Karachi for a week and by then 'sihail” will have appeared and Bahrain will be cool.*' H.H. has decided to leave here on the 24th, reaching Karachi on 26th, and will leave Karachi on the 2nd or 3rd, on whichever day the ship sails. H.H. and Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad attended a dinner party at the residence of the Governor of Punjab last night. According to Shaikh Abdullah it went very well.

His Highness is in excellent health. Five days ago there was little sugar in him. This forenoon I was with the Oivil Surgeon. I have arranged that our Indian doctor should meet the Civil Surgeon with a sample of urine for test at the Ripon Hospital, on Friday 18th. The Civil Surgeon said that he was going to send a report on His Highness’s health to Dr. Davenport Jones, but I have asked him for a copy which I shall send to you. His Highness is now aole to close his hand and he is very glad that the electric treatment has been beneficial. The dinners at the residence of the Governor of the Punjab and at the Viceregal lodge were a success. H.H. enjoyed the dinners. He wore the decorations and was in cere monial dress. He is dining at Mr. Caroe’s house on the Slst with Shaikh Abdullah. His Highness has decided to leave Simla on the 24th reaching Karachi on the 26th and will sail from Karachi according to the present programme on the 3rd. I tried on several occasions to persuade him to stay on but my efforts were in vain. His Highness sends you his salaams.
