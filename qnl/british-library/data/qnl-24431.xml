My dear Gilbert, iou will remember that early last May it became necessary (in order to get the way clear for the -anglo-Persian Oil Company's concessionj to settle very hurriedly with Fowle the question of the future arrangements for jurisdiction over foreigners in Qatar. Owing to the need for haste we were unfortunately unable here to keep our legal advisers in touch with the developments, but -oeckett was a ood enough to go into the matter shortly afterwards and I enclose, for your information and any observations which you may have to offer, a copy of a minute that he wrote on the subject on May loth. 2. So far as we can see, the inconsistency pointed out in the second paragraph of Beckett's minute is due to the fact that in the course of the negotiations with the Sheikh of ; ^atar about jurisdiction the practice has arisen of referring to the subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf as British protected persons for the purposes of jurisdiction within the Gulf itself. These persons apparently have been, and are, considered as British protected persons not only for the purpose of consular and diplomatic protection throughout the world, but also of the world, e.g. China and Egypt; but so far as we are aware they have never before been classified as British protected persons for the purposes of jurisdiction within the i^rab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf. 3. The confusion resulting from the present system by which the subjects of Arab States in the Gulf are /\ generally fo r the purpose of jurisdiction in other parts J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E described/described, in most cases, as ’’British protected persons” while remaining in the class of subjects of foreign Moslem States for the purposes of jurisdiction in the Gulf itself, is unsatisfactory, but with one exception (referred to below; does not appear likely to lead to practical difficulties in the present case, since we haye agreed to the Sheikh of Q,atar retaining jurisdiction over ’’the subjects of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast,” and the latter are only ieferred to as British protected persons by implication in the words ”... all other British protected persons • . .’’in paragraph 4 of the Kesi dent's letter Bo.0/129 of May 11th to the Sheikh. Moreover, you vvill see that Beckett in paragraph 4 of his minute of May 15th has suggested how the position could be regularised in the eventual Uatar Order in Council by an addition to the definition of a British protected person for the purposes of the Order as given in article 4 of the Koweit Order in Council of last February. 4. fhe exception referred to above where the position does appear unsatisfactory is the case of subjects of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. The Sheikh of Q,atar has not claimed to retain jurisdiction over the Muscatis, and it appears necessary, in view of the terns of paragraph 4 of the letter C 129 to the Sheikh, to decide whether the Sultan's subjects are to be considered, for the purposes of the eventual Qatar Order in Council, as British protected persons or as subjects of a Moslem foreign State. It seems to us important to take a definite decision on this point since if Muecatis are treated as British protected persons disputes between them and British subjects or the subjects of non-Moslem foreign States would come under/under the exclusive jurisdiction of ihe British political authorities. If, on the other hand, they are to be regarded as subjects of a Moslem foreign State ; then such cases would presumably come before the proposed joint court. 5. Since writing the enclosed minute, Beckett has seen Fowle 1 s letter C/129 of May 11th to the Sheikh about jurisdiction. He points out that paragraph 3 of this letter contcdns the following two omissions as compared with paragraph 3 of the Resident's earlier letter to the Sheikh on the same subject, Ho.C/ll4 of April 18th last:- (a&gt; British protected persons are not mentioned although they were included in the letter of April 18th between the words 'British subjects' and 'the subjects of non-Moslem foreign Powers'. It is not clear whether this omission is deliberate or not - we notice that the Sheikh himself omitted to mention them in paragraph 3 of his letter No.7/54 of April 18th - hut Beckett thinks we must proceed on the basis that it is intended to include British protected persons in this class for the purposes of disputes coming before the proposed joint court. (b) There is no mention in the letter C/129 of May 11th of disputes between British subjects, British protected persons and non-Moslem foreigners on the one hand and Moslem foreigners on the other bend, although the words 'or the subjects of Moslem foreign Powers' did follow the words 'your subjects' in paragraph 2 of Fowie's letter to the Sheikh C/114 of April 18th. Although the Sheikh agreed to this in paragraph 3 of hie letter No.7/54 of upril 18th (subject to the proviso that he would not be responsible for any objection which might be raised to this arrangement by Governments of Moslem foreign States; the point is simply dropped/V 4. dropped in ^he setter of May 11th, Beckett thinks we must in this case as well proceed on the assumption that the Sheikh has agreed to what we want; but he points out that this means that the jurisdiction granted to His Majesty*s Government by the Sheikh unfortunately cannot now be based on the exchange of letters of May 11th only, but must rest upon the other two letters of April idth a. well. This may be all right for practical purposes, but, as Beckett points out, the matter is not left in as regular and satisfactory a state as one could wish. 6. Another point about which Beckett and I are not very happy is the use in Fowle's letters to the Sheikh of the expressions 'subjects of non-Moslem foreign Powers'' and 'subjects of Moslem foreign Powers' . We feel that in view of recent developments the criterion of a Moslem Power (State) is now very imprecise - e.g. the case of Turkey, where there is no longer any State religion - and we should have preferred to have used the words 'Moslem foreigners' instead. Beckett remembers having raised this point in connexion with the recent Koweit Order in Council, and although the expression 'Moslem State' was retained in that Order he is inclined to thinks (a view with which I strongly agree; that we ought now to consider the use of a new and more up to date formula (distinguishing between the religions of individuals rather than of States) when the time comes to prepare the Q,atar Order in Council. 7. I understand from Ward, who has discussed the matter with Crombie, that you have not yet taken any steps towards preparing the Qatar Order in Council. When the time comes to do so I think that it would be most useful, subject to your views, for our two departments to get into touch at tn early stage with a view to considering the various points mentioned in this letter and any other difficulties that may arise//v arise i 5. • I hear that Crombie expressed the opinion that we should be able to regularise the position and get round any omissions in Fowle’s correspondence with the Sheikh when drafting the actual terms of the Order in Council, and that you are thinking of showing the Sheikh the draft Order in Council before it is completed, with a view to ^securing his fonnal concurrence in its terms and putting beyond doubt exactly what jurisdiction he has agreed to cede to us. Tours ever, (SB.) GEORGE BEMEL. A(E. 3400/3400/91). I have read through these papers and the position# as it appears to me# is as follows* At the moment# as a matter of strict law# it would he difficult to establish that the Sheikh of Qatar has not jurisdiction over all persons in his territories# whether British subjects# other foreigners or otherwise. We propose, however, to obtain from him a grant of jurisdiction. The grant will take the form of letters exchanged with the political resident* Then having acquired our jurisdiction from the Sheikh, we shall have to make provision for its exercise and this means the passing of an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act* I gather that the jurisdiction which it is contemplated we shall acquire under the exchange of letters with the Sheikh is as follows* His Majesty will have jurisdiction in Qatar over all British subjects# all British protected persons other than the natives of Koweit, Bahrein and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast and of course Qatar subjects ^ themselves who are, I suppose# British protected persons# and all foreigners who are not subjects of a Moslem State* The ^ Sheikh of Qatar will thus retain jurisdiction himself in respect of Qatar subjects# natives of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast and nationals of Moslem States# an expression which will# I suppose, cover Saudi Arabians, Iraqis and Persians* I gather that we consider (and I see myself no reason to dissent from this view), that natives of Muscat would be regarded for this purpose as British protected persons and not as being foreigners, nationals of a Moslem State* (I feel a little uncertain whether# when the Koweit Order was drafted, it was understood that in Koweit the natives/A 2. natives of the other Sheikhdoms on the Persian Gulf were to he regarded as British protected persons and not as foreigners nationals of a Moslem State coming under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Koweit for the purposes of that Orders They are undoubtedly British protected persons, but I cannot help thinking that the Sheikh of Koweit, when he agreed to the terms of the Order in Council, thought that these persons would be in the other category* Consequently, I think there is some danger of their being some x inconsistency between the two cases, and I am not sure that the attention of the Inaia Office ought not to be called to it)* Mixed cases, that is to say cases between parties, one of whom is a person subject to our jurisdiction and the other is a person subject to the Jheixh’s jurisdiction, are to come before a 11 joint court'* The exact jurisdiction which we acquire will, of course, depend upon the interpretation of the text of the letters when they are exchanged but, assuming that the result is what I have set out above, we shall, I imagine, make a Qatar Order in Council on the following lines* Generally speaking, it would be based upon the Koweit Order in Council, 1955* As regards the definitions which come in Article 4, upon which the jurisdiction conferred in Article 8 depends, we should have to insert in the definition of 'British protected person' of the Koweit Order something on the following lines after the words 'but does not include' in line 4:- 'a national of Bahrein, Koweit or the Trucial Sheikhs'. Further, in Part 5 of the Order in Council, which deals with mixed cases, it would be provided that these cases should go before a joint court (compare on this point/* J 3 // 1 point Part 5 of the Bahrein Order in Council and the definition of M joint court* in Article 4).

Would you please refer to paragraph 3 of your derui-official letter to Laithwaite, D-O. No.C/243 of 26th July last, about jurisdiction over foreigners in qatar, where you state that r, the subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf have always been treated as British protected persons in the Gulf' (i.e. for jurisdictional purposes). This statement does not square with the position as we in this Office have always imagined it to be under the Orders in Council at Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat, and you will remember that we had some discussion with you on the subject while you were here. Since the question may affect the definition of the expressions ’’British protected person”, ’’Qatar subject” (or ''national'’) and ’’foreigner” in the new Qatar Order in Council which we/ The Hon’ble , Lieut.-Col.T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., —^ ^ . The Residency, r\ ■ r S* Bushire.* 2 . we propose to suggest to the Government of India should now be produced, it seems desirable that we should know where we stand and that the matter should therefore be further investigated. With a view to this being done I shall attempt to set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 below the position as we understand it at Bahrein and Koweit, and I should be grateful for your comments on these paragraphs. We do not appear to have any papers on the position at Muscat but in order to make quite sure we should be glad if you could confirm that Bahreinis, Koweitis and 'Trucial Coastis' are treated at Muscat as British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes. 2. Bahrein . The Bahrein Order in Council of 1913 provides for the jurisdiction of the political Agent over British subjects including British protected persons but this Order in Council wasdrawn up in the light of the Sheikh’s representations that his delegation of jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government in 1909 was intended only/4. to know whether natives of Koweit, Muscat, Q,atar and the Trucial Sheikhdsoms are in fact registered 'by t h~ political Agent at Bahrein under the provisions of the Order in Council as British protected persons, though their non-registration might not be a conclusive argument (see paragraph 5 below). 3. Koweit . in connection with the issue of the original Koweit Order in Council in 1925. the Sheikh of Koweit delegated to His Majesty's Government jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons and the subjects andprotected persons of non-Muslim foreign Governments (reference Bushire letter Ho. 2517 of 19th December 1925 to the Government of India). Although the correspondence itself is not explicit on the point we have always understood here that the Sheiidi's surrender of jurisdiction over British protected persons was not intended to deprive him of his own jurisdiction over natives of the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, particularly in view of the Bahrein/s © Bahrein precedent mentioned above. As you will remember, our understanding has since been confirmed by a reference to Dickson, and I enclose herewith a To'political 'Resident'dated 5th October.) copy of the telegram which From political Agent ^dated^7th^0ctober.^) ^ at your sug g e8 tion together with a copy of Dickson’s rep^y. 4. On the general question of the meaning ox the phrase 'British protected person' it would no doubt be generally agreed that the phrase is a vague one whi.h is susceptible of varying interpretations, and that in practice it can be and is interpreted for different purposes in different ways in accordance with what happens to suit us best in any particular case. It is also generally agreed that the term 'British protected person' used in its widest sense would cover the natives of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and these persons are included as a last category of British protected persons in the Consular Instructions. In the stricter sense, however, the egression 'British protected person/6 • person' bears the ordinary meaning of 'a native of a British protectorate, protected State, or mandated territory' and we have always been chary of admitting that the Arab States of the Gulf are British protected States and have preferred to describe them as being 'in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government'. 5, m this connection it may be remembered that ^ although 'British protected persons' have to be registered at the Political Agency under the provisions of the Bahrein Order in Council it was ruled in 1931 with the concurrence of the Boreign Office that it vas not necessary for the Political Agent to register sucn persons as natives of the Hadramaut (which is now included in the Aden Protectorate) but only British protected persons proper (reference correspondence noted (1) Bushire letter 110.1762 of 22nd August 1931 ) to the Government of India. ) (2^ Government of India’s letter Ho.P.132-N/31 ) / of 30th September 1931 to India Of!ice. ; (3) India Office letter Ho .P. Z. 8072/31 of ) 21st January 1932 to Government of India.) not/ in the margin). The Aden 'protectorate' is of course really a misnomer, since it is7 not in the ordinary sense a protectorate at all but approximates constitutionally very closely to the position of the Arab States in the Gulf in special treaty relations. 6.

P,Z.7591/35. 29th November 1935 By Air Mail . Sir, I am directed by the Secretary ,of State for India to refer to Bushire Express Lduter No.C/137 of 12th May 1935 and connected correspondence on the subject of the Qatar Oil Concession. In vie^ of the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and the delegation by the Sheikh to His Majesty's Government of jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons and the subjects of non-Muslim foreign powers, the Marquess of Zetland, after consultation with the Foreign Office, is of the opinion that the position should now be regularised as soon as possible by the issue of an Order in Council un der th e Foreign Juris.liction Acts, defining the extent of His Majesty's jurisdiction in ^atar. His Lordship would therefore suggest that if no objection is seen, a draft QataV Order in Council should now be prepared by the Government of India, in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and'T*orwarded to the Secretary of State for final consideration by His Majesty's Government. The new Order in Council would be on the same lines mutatis mutandis as the Koweit Order in Council, 1935. 2 / The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi.2 © w p 3o 2. Since there is at present no resident Political Agent in Qatar, it is proposed that His Majesty's jurisdiction in Qatar should, in the first instance at any rate, be exercised through the Political Agent at Bahrein or his representative, and it is accordingly suggested that the expression 'Political Agent' should be defined in the new Order in Council so as to include the Political Agent at Bahrein or his (1) Foreign Office demi-official letter of 18th July with _ enclosure (copy forwarded by P &gt;' Air Mail of 19th July under No. P.Z.4926/35). (2) Demi-official letter No.C/243 of a . 26th July from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

With regard to the definition in the new Order in Council of the expressions 'British protected person', 'Qatar subject' and 'foreigner', I am to refer to the demi-official correspondence noted in the margin, from which it will be seen that under the Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat Orders in Council, as at present drafted, there is some possibility of uncertainty arising as 1 to whether the subjects of the Arab States in t he Per sian Gulf in special Treaty relations with His Majesty's Government should, or should not, be treated as British protected persons &gt; * for jurisdictional purposes. In view of the fact that it has been agreed in correspondence exchanged between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Sheikh of Qatar that jurisdiction over the nationals of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms should continue to be exercised by the Sheikh, it seems desirable that in order to avoid any uncertainty on this-•v f 3 i - 3 - I point the expression 'British protected person' should be specifically defined in the Qatar Order in Council so as to exclude the subjects of the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial States, as suggested in Mr, Beckett's minute of 18th July 1935, a copy of which was enclosed in the Foreign Office demi-official letter of 18th July 1935. As regards the position of Muscat subjects under the new Order in Council, the Secretary of State would welcome an expression of the Government of India's views in due course. As at present advised, he is inclined to agree with the view expressed in paragraph 4 of Colonel Fowle's demi-official letter of 26th July that Muscatis should be treated in Qatar as British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes, and he would suggest that in that case it might be as well to define 'British protected persons' so as to include specifically subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. 4. I am also to invite attention to the Foreign Office suggestion mentioned in paragraph 6 of Mr.Rendel's letter of 18th July and in paragraph 7 of Colonel Fowle's letter of the 26th July already referred to, that in the Qatar Order in Council the religion of individuals, rather than of States, should be adopted as the criterion in distinguishing foreigners under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent from foreigners under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. In this connection I ) enclose copies of further demi- official correspondence with the To Foreign Office, dated 28th August, 1935. From Foreign Office, dated , ^ T , , 30th September, 1935) Foreign office. It will be seen that the Foreign Office have stressed the point that the expression 'Muslim State 1 ' as used in the definition of 'Koweit subject' in Article 4 of the Koweit Order in Council, 1935, is now somewhat imprecise. Moreover, the3- - 4 - ff Foreign Office suggestion would no doubt be acceptable to the Sheikh as tending, in theory at any rate, to bring more Muslims under his jurisdiction. On the other hand, it may be argued that no difficulty is likely to arise in practice by retaining the phraseology used in the Koweit Order in Council, particularly if a provision is included in the Qatar Order corresponding to Article 8(2) of the Koweit Order, which gives the Political Resident power to decide as to the status of any person in doubtful cases, and that if the Foreign Office suggestion were adopted, and the expression 'Qatar subject' consequently defined in the Qatar Order in Council so as to include 'any person, not being a British subject, who is a Muslim', it is conceivable that some European power might object to its Muslim subjects (who might in some cases be themselves Europeans) being placed in a different category from British Muslims for jurisdictional purposes. The Secretary of State has no very strong views on the question. He would be glad, in due course, to receive the views of the Government of India. 5. When the draft Qatar Order in Council has been approved by His Majesty’s Government, it is suggested that it might be communicated to the Sheikh of Qatar for his formal concurrence, as was done in the case of the Koweit Order in Council, 1935, before it is finally submitted to His Majesty in Council. 6. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Bahrein. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (StSM^e WALTON,» . * 'Jr J INDIA OFFICE ■vHITEhALL 9 o«• 1 28th August, 1935. My dear Ward, ft Would you kindly refer to Rendel'sXLetter to Laithwaite, dated 18th July, No.E.3400/3400/91, on the subject of the future arrangements for jurisdiction over foreigners in Qatar. A copy of this letter and Beckett’s note was sent privately to Fowle, a copy of whose reply I now enclose. Paragraph 6 of his letter does not entirely answer paragraph 5(b) of Aendel’s letter, out it seems clear that for practical purposes it will be all right to depend on the double exchange of letters between Fowle and the Sheikh, and not merely on the single exchange of May 11th. As regards paragraph 7 of Fowle's letter, the objections to the term ’’Muslim foreigner” certainly appear to be formidable, and personally I should have thought that there might be something to be said for sticking to the old form of words, in the absence of any special reason to suppose that it will, in fact, cause difficulties. However, if the Foreign Office feel strongly on this matter it might be discussed with Fowle when he is in London. It is now perhaps time that we got on with the actual drafting of the Order in Council which presumably should be done, as in the case oi the Koweit Order in Council, by the Government of India in the first/ J.G. Ward, Esq., Foreign Office, S.A. 1.2 &amp; first place. Copies will be sent to us for final consideration, in consultation with the Foreign Office, and to the Resident. When the final draft is approved, it may be communicated, as was done in the case of the Koweit Order, to the Sheikh of Qatar for his formal concurrence. If you agree generally with this programme I will put it up here. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) M.J. CLAUSON.m / ,V P.Z.6972/35 X FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 30th September, 1935. (E 5247/3400/91) Dear Clauson, n Will you please refer to your letter of the 28th August to V/ajd, covering a copy of Colonel Fowle’s letter No. C/243 of the 26th July to Laithwaite (P.Z.5303/35) on the subject of jurisdiction over foreigners in Qatar. Beckett, to whom Fowle's letter has been shown, regards as very interesting the assurance in paragraph 3 that subjects of Arab States of the Persian Gulf have always been regarded when in the territory of another Arab state of the Gulf as British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes, e.g. that for these purposes a Bahraini is in Muscat a British protected person and not the 'subject of a non-Christian power and not 'represented by a Consul at Muscat'. 3. This statement of the position does not square with Beckett’s earlier impression, derived from discussions with the India Office. But presumably Fowle is the man who knows and his assurance removes the inconsistency to which attention was drawn in Beckett’s minute of the 15th May and in Mendel's letter of 18th July (E 3400/3400/91) to Laithwaite in which a copy of that minute was enclosed. The point need therefore no longer be pursued. 4. Before proceeding, however, it may be vorth pointing out that the existence of this practice cannot be supported by a reference to the position at Bahrain, since/ M.J. Clauson, EsqL2 31 since all foreigners at Bahrain, including the nationals of other Moslem States, come under British jurisdiction. 5. As regards paragraphs 4-6 of Fowle’s letter, Beckett agrees with you that the grant of jurisdiction from the Sheikh of ^atar has to be based on all four letters exchanged, and not on the exchange of the 11th May only. This may not matter very much, however, especially if the usual course is followed of getting the Sheikh to approve the draft Order-in-Council as giving effect correctly, on the jurisdictional points, to the exchanges of letters. 6. With regard to paragraph 7 of Fowle's letter, Beckett does not regard as conclusive the objections to the expression 'Moslem foreigner' which we had suggested. On particular points in that paragraph he has made the following observations:- (a) 'If this term were used all Moslem subjects of 'non-Moslem foreign powers would come under the 'jurisdiction of the Sheikh, e.g. a North African Moslem 'subject of France'. This is quite correct, but it is what we intended. (b) 'But this would clash with the cession by the 'Sheikh of jurisdiction over all foreigners'. Surely this is not quite correct, since the Sheikh is not ceding jurisdiction over all foreigners, but is in any case retaining jurisdiction over certain of them, viz. nationals of Moslem States, as well as Koweitis, Bahrainis, etc. (See paragraph 3 of the letter No. 0/114- of the 18th April to the Sheikh). It is merely a question of the best way of defining the foreigners who are exempted from the cession. (c)/(c) 'The use of this term...would mean that a man 'by changing his religion would change his judicial 'status... .ag. a Frenchman so long as he remained a non- 'Moslem would come under British jurisdiction; on 'becoming a Moslem however he would ipso facto come 'under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh’.' This is quite true: but Beckett does not see anything very objectionable in it. The whole point, as he sees it, is that Moslem tribunals, such as the Sheikh's, may be suitable for Moslems but are not suitable for other people; and a change of religion will at the present moment in Palestine, Egypt, Persia (see No.12 of the 'Safeguards') and indeed in many other countries have the effect of altering the tribunals to which an individual is subject, in certain classes of cases at any rate. 7. It may, of course, be better in making the Qatar Order-in-Council, to keep the expression 'national of a Moslem State', which was used in the Koweit Order and which appears by implication ('non-Christian!') in the Muscat Order of 1915, just because it exists in those other Orders, and because we may not wish to introduce the change for the first time in the '^atar Order. We are not sure however that there is very much in this, and still think that 'Moslem foreigner' is a better criterion than 'national of a Moslem State'. 8. But in any case we agree with the programre for the drafting of the Order which you outline in paragraph 4 of your letter. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

In reply to paragraphs S and 4 of your Express setter, nrtIves of Kuwait, Mhscat an# Qatar and Trucial %£iklidonis are not registered as British protected persons, because for the purpose of registration, as opnosed to jurisdiction, they have not been regarded as 'British subjects' (though the term includes British protected versons: see Article £/i of 'The Bahrain (Amendment Order in Council, 1988' and in the definition in Article 4 of the rder in’Council 1. 13) • M far as I am aware no person in these categories has ever asked to be registered as a British protected person, though they come under the Political Agent if involved in criminal or civil proceedings.

T.6340/173/378, dated 20th May 1931, regarding the registration of British protected persons at Bahrain, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the letter from the Government of India No.J?*132- N/31, dated 30th September 1931, on this subject, copy of *hich was forwarded to the Foreign Office on the 20th October, and to say that, for the reasons stated therein and in the accompanying letter from the Officiating Political Hesident, he concurs in the view that it is unnecessary to register the persons referred to. Subject therefore to any further observations which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may have to offer, he proposes to authorise the issue of instructions on the lines which the Government of India suggest, viz: to register British Protected Persons proper, such as subjects of Indian States, who reside, or make a prolonged stay in Bahrain. There would appear to be little utility in registering at Bahrain the floating population, v/hich apparently increases largely during the pearling season, and is not regularly resident in Bahrain; and it will be observed that it is stated that the extra work involved would involve the entertainment of an additional clerk, which, it is presumed, might for financial reasons be out of the question at the present time. Moreover many of these persons appear to be Hadramautis who apparently need not necessarily be regarded as British Protected Persons in the narrower sense of the term (compare Foreign / The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE.Foreign Office despatch to Cairo of 9th April 1931, No.338}, and there iray be others whose status is similar. It would appear doubtful whether such persons should be regarded as fal3ing within the class of M British Protected Persons” who are included in the definition of 'British Subjects' in the Bahrain Order in Council. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,($) in Extract from India Office Memorandum No. B.422 P.1632/30 dated the 3rd March 1930. 11. At no eubsequent stage does the Shaikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation o: responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Government. Difficulties, however, arose in the post war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Saud as to tne exercise of jurisdiction by the Shaikh over Nejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have been made at acout tne same time by the Shaikh of qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on their behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920 a notice that a^l foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab Rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrain, were, while in Bahrain, entitled to British protection. The decision was not well received by the Shaikh; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequently amended.Extract paragraph 28 of letter No.295-S of 1st September 1927 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. XX XX xxx x x 28. During 1920 the question of jurisdiction over Nejdis and the people of Hasa had caused some friction between Shaikh Isa and the Political Agent. On the 5th May 1920 the Secretary of State for India informed Shaikh Abdulla by letter through the usual sources that with reference to his first demand of the previous year quoted above the Government agreed that the Shaikh of Bahrain should exercise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab Rulers, provided that the Rulers themselves concurred, but on the 8th of the same month the Political Agent had already stated that Bin Saud objected to the Shaikh controlling his subjects and in July reported that Bin Saud had in writing requested him to exercise the jurisdiction in question. The Shaikh of Q,atar sent a similar request. The Political Agent accordingly issued a notice on the 26th November 1920 that all foreign subjects including Persians and subjects of Arab rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrain are, while residing, in Bahrain entitled to the protection of His Majesty’s Government. Thus jurisdiction over all foreigners passed to the Political Agent. The situation naturally caused friction with Shaikh Isa and left him smarting.

I’or if the uniformity argument were allowed to prevail it would mean that a text however defective, would have to be kept in perpetuity, or to remain until it was convenient to alter it in all the Persian Gulf terri- -tories simultaneously, it seems, however, better that each time it is necessary to make a ne w Order we diould take as a basi s the most recent existing Order and then incorporate any improvements which obcur to us. Thus we are taking the Koweit order as the model for Qatar because the Rowe it Order is now the most recent, but when we come to make the nSXt Order the Qatar one will then pre sumab ly be takery'2 / I? taken as the model. in this connection you will remember that we have already mentioned to the India Office that we think the iiahrain order-in- Council should be amended to bring it up to date, and it is by no means impossible that the Muscat Order may also want overhauling. 3* 1 will now detail the amendments sug- -gested. in paragraph 4 - the definition of a British protected person - we think the insertion of the words rt other than a 'corporation* is, strict- -ly speaking, required in the place indicated below. *Ve are inclined also to agree with the view expressed by the Government of xndia, in paragraph 2 of their letter of the 20th August, that the words in brackets about the subjects of the Sultan of Muscat should be omitted. At the and of the same definition we think that the words 'under Article 8^i)(a) {ii) and (iii) of this Order' should be added. uhese words appear in the Koweit Order and there seems no reason for omitting them. ihe definition will therefore run as follows:- 'British protected person means a person other — than ’a corporation properly erjoying His Majesty’s protection 'in Qatar but does not include - *Hl) a British subject as defined in the British 'nationality 'and Status of Aliens Act 1914; 'iii) the subjects of the shaikhs of Bahrain,Kuwait 'and Trucial States; or '(iii) such foreigners or Qatar subjects as are persons subject to this Order under Article 8 llHaHii) and (III) of this Order' 4. in this connexion we should like to draw the attention of the India Office to the fact that in Koweit, according to the information contained in -Bushire/-3 Bush ire letter no .D.0.116-8 of the 13 th February, Arab 1936, the subjects of other/Uulf States are not in fact treated as British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes in noweit althou^jh the' Government of India in their letter of the 2Cth August write as though they were. nov/ever, according to the wording of the &amp;oweit Order- in-Jouncil they should be so treated, and it is for this reason that in adapting the Jioweit Order to vjatar it has been thought necessary specific- -ally to exclude subjects of the Shaikhs of Bahrain, Koweit and the iTucial Coast. *e think, therefore, that it may be desirable either that the lioweit order should be amended in order to state the position accurately or else that the practice in howeit should be made to conform to the wording of the order. 5. as regards the definition of ^atar subjects we observe that the Government of India agree that the Foreign Office view as to the way the provision she Id be drafted is really right, but that they think the less satisfactory howei t Order text should be retained ^a) for uniformity ar^d ^b) because it corresponds with the terms of the exchange of notes vd th the Shaikh. as y regards {&amp;) 1 have already dealt with this point in paragraph 2 above and we think that uniforrn- -ity should be obtained by amending the other Orders where necessary. as regards {b) we would suggest that the point could be dealt with if necessary when the terms of the order ^if it is/4 is intended to do this) are submitted to the Shaikh of ^tar for fonnal approval. His explicit assent to this variation from the wording of the exchange of notes could then be obtained. We also suggest a drafting amendment designed to avoid giving the impress- -ion that Moslem foreigners may be considered as Qatar subjects for purposes other than for this Order. ihe definition of a ^atar subject will then runs- X **Qatar subject* means a subject of *the Shaikh of Qatar and shall be deemed for the purpose of this Order to include any Moslem person not being a Hritish subject*. 6. 'iHe definition of a ‘'foreigner* also in Article 4 appears to require the insertion of the v/ords “including a corporation* because it is presumably intended that an American cor- -poratiou in Qatar should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and not to that of the bhaikh. ihe definition of a foreign- -er therefore will runs- *Porsigner * means any person including a corporation not a Hritish or ,^tar subject*. ihe general definition stating that the word person includes a corporation only comes later on. 7. you will notice that in the Koweit Order-wherev-er Statutes of the united Kingiom or Orders-in-Council of the Uni ted hingdom are referred to for the first time, a foot note appears giving their reference in the table of Statutes or in Statu taryStatutary Rules and Orders as the case may be. However, the Govenment of India for some reason seem to have struck all these references out in the draft ^atar Order-in-Oouncil, but it seems desirable that they should be retained. i'rom the practical point of view they are useful and we believe that it was a direction of the Privy Council that they should be inserted. m any case it is the practice, even if not invariably followed, to insert them; we therefore suggest that they should be inserted wherever they appear in the howeit Order. 8. v/ith reference to Article 8, the words ‘•persons subject to this Order* 1 are used constantly throughout the remainder of the Order and there i s no doubt that these words mean the persons comprised within paragraphs li), ^ii)» and (iii) of sub-paragraph l of Article 8. on the other hand it does not seem that the Order ever says so in terms and therefore from the drafting point of view some amendment is desirable. Je therefore suggest that paragraph ^i) of sub-para- - graph l of Article 8 should re ads- •Ha) (i) British subjects within the limits of t hi s Order 1 * s rt (ii) Foreigners within the limits of this o Order' '(iiij Q^tar subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners; with the proviso/it- proviso that all cases wherein such ^atar subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provision of part 5 of this urderj hereinafter referred to as '’persons subject to this Order*. In place of ^iv) write ib) The property and all personal or pro- -prietory rights and liabilities v/ithin the said limits of persona subject to this order whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. m place of {v) write (c) in place of ^vi) write id) in place of (vii) write (e). 9. m article 12 we suggest an addition which is i think self-explanatory. The object of the amendment and of a corresponding one in Article 21 is to make it easier for people read- -ing the Order to see that as regards three of the Statutes there are two different Articles which make adaptations. ihus the end of para- -graph:12il) would read: “and to the exceptions, adaptations and modifications specified in sub- -Article (2} of this Article “and in article 21 below'*. Article 21(4) v/ill read “ihe foregoing provisions of this article shall be deemed as well as the provisions of Article 12(2) above to be adaptations etc.'* c 10* In Article 19^1) there is one place where the Government of India have forgotten to delete Koweit and substitute ^.tar. ( 11 m Article 47 the Probates Order-in- Council/7 Order-in-Council 1908 has now been repealed by an Order of 1935 so that the Article should read M The foreign Jurisdiction Probates H Order- -in-Council, 1935“ and the foot note will read 0 1935, iio.eoe*. 12* as regards part vi on the subject of registration, the existing text based on the Aoweit Order provides for the registration of british subjects. According to thi definition, british subjects mean la) british subjects proper, lb) bri tish protected persons and lc) british corpor- -ations, in this connexion the first point to notice is that in Articles 58 and 59 it can- -not be intended in fact to include corporations because these are dealt wi th later in Article 67 et seq » Therefore a drafting addition is necessary to exclude these corporations, Secondly, as regards persons who must register the existing text, since it includes british protected persons means inter alia that the subjects of the bultan of iauscat would have to be registered, on the other hand, no provision is made for the registra- -tion of foreigners who are subject to .the juris- -diction and it seems to us to be just as necessary a for the purposes of the proper operation of the Order that American citizens etc, who are living in ^atar subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent should register as that british subjects should do so. We therefore think that these articles should provide for the registration of all persons subj ect/subject to the urder and the amendment suggested below is designed to do this. ihe amendment suggested in Articles 60 arid 66 are consequential, article 58 would then read 'A register of persons subject to this Order * ‘pother than corporations) shall be kept in the Political Agency* 1 . Article 59 would then read ^every person subject to this -rder lother than a corporation) resident within the limits of this Order shall, in the month of January of each year, be registered at the Political Agency. A person subject to this order arriving etc. '♦ Article 60 would read *Where a person is in possession of a valid dritish or foreign passport etc.* 1 The middle of Article 66 would read as follows: “as a .British subject within the limits of this order and he and any other per- -sons subject to this order who neglects to obtain regi.strati on shall be liable to a fine etc.** 13. tilth reference to Article 67 which deals with the registration of companies, it seems to us. that a foreign company carrying on business in Kuwait under the jurisdiction of thejpolitical Agent shoud register in the same manner as a dritish company has to and we suggest an amendment to effect this together with a c oi sequential amendment to Article 73. The middle of Article 67 would read.. ..“protected states or mandated territories or in any other country outside the limits of this order other than dahrain, howeit and the Trucial States and carrying on business etc.** And Article 73li) would read “A British company shall not be entitled to be recognised or protected as a dritish company unless it is registered “under this Order, but a^- s --k com pany and any other canpany subject to thia Order shall etc, » Yours sincerely, sd/- T.V.BrenanP.Z.7647/36 india Office, Whitehall, a.W.l. 15th December 1936. My dear .arenan, Would you please refer to your letter of 24th October, lio.E.6362/208/91 on the subject of the draft (^atar Order in Council. We agree generally with the amendments suggested by the foreign Office, and there are only two points on which we wish to offer observations, the first of which relates to the definition of '^atar subject 11 in Article 4. We agree with you that it would be as well to discard the unsatis- -factory definition used in the noweit Order but we are not clear whether the phrase ’•Muslim person** used in your amended definition is intended to in- -clude or exclude “Muslim Corporation*. if, as we assume, exc lu si on is intended, it may be as well to say so in the definition, if you agre. An alter- -native solution might be to omit the word “person 11 after “MoslemWould you kindly let us know what you think. Our other point is that a definition of the expressions “person to whom this order applies* and “person subject to this order* is contained in the penultimate paragraph of Article 4, and is these circumstances no amendment of article 8 appears to be required. When we have settled the out star, ding point dealt with above, we proposed to submit the amended draft for approval without further reference to/CONFIDENTIAL. No. 142-S of 1937.

The Government of India will observe that, as the result of correspondence with the Foreign Office (of which copies have already been sent to them) the phrase M any person, not being a British subject, who is a national of any other Moslem State” in the definition of 'Qatar subject' in Article 4, has been changed to 'any Moslem person, other than a Corporation, not being a British subject'. The definition in its final form is thus not precisely in accordance with the agreement reached in the Exchange of Notes with the Sheikh; it will therefore be necessary to explain the change to him and obtain his consent in writing. If the Government of India see no objection, I am to request that the Political Resident may be instructed to approach the Sheikh on this point. In view of the considerations referred to in the demi-official letter from the Foreign Office dated the 18th July, 1935, of which a copy was sent to the Government of India by the air mail of the 19th July, No. P.Z.4926/35, it may be desirable for the Resident to set out fully in his communication to the Sheikh the classes of persons and I The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Nev/ Delhi. cases/cases in respect of vmich jurisdiction is to be exercised letter No. 103-S of 21st January, 1937) does not recommend that the draft Order in Council should be shown to the Sheikh, and it is proposed, unless the Government of India see any objection, to accept the Resident’s view in tills matter. 4 . a copy of this letter (and enclosure) is being sent to the political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent at Bahrein. by the political /gent demi-official I am, Sir Your obedient Servant (Sgd.)

The sentence of the Qazi ^vhen ratified by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be regarded as if it were the decision of the Political Agent in the District Court.

In cases in which the Code of Criminal Procedure requires the sentence of a Court of Session to be confirmed by the High Court, the sentence shall be referred for confirmation to the Governor-General of India in Council instead of to the Chief Court. 17 . Where a person subject to the Order is accused of the commission of an offence, the cognisance whereof appertains to the Court, and it is expedient that the offence be enquired of, tried, determined, and punished in a British Possession, the accused may (under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, section 6) be sent for trial to Bombay. The Chief Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Resident, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Bombay accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and retain the person therein named and to carry him to and deliver him up at Bombay, according to the warrant. Where any person is to be sent to Bombay, the Court before which he is charged shall take the preliminary examination,r I&lt;D and shall bind over such of the proper witnesses as are British subjects in their own recognisances to appear and give evidence on the trial. Ig,—(!)

Political.4 © a i &lt; w ^ C' 1 ' / /&amp; &lt; ^'- ^ ' The position is that the Shaikh of Qatar has agreed that disputes betv/een British Subjects, British Protected Persons and the subjects of Non-Moslem Foreign Powers should t be settled by the Political Agent: and that disputes between persons of the above class and Qatar subjects or subjects of Moslem Foreign Powers should be referred to a Joint Court, 2. Now His Majesty’s Government have cut out the use of the word Moslem or Non-Moslem Foreign Power and in defining 'Qatar subjects' used the phrase 'Moslem person, other than a Corporation, not being a British subject', 3. The Political Agent will exercise jurisdiction over (i) British subjects (ii) Forei Tiers (iii) Qatar subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners. 'British subject' means (a) a Britisher proper (b) British Protected person, which excludes subjects of Bahrain, Kuwait and the Trucial States. 'Foreigner' means any person, including a Corpora tion, not a British or a Qatar subject. 'Qatar subject' means a subject of the Shaikh of Qatar or any Moslem person other than a Corporation who is not a British subject. 4. The essential point to be explained to the Shaikh of Qatar is that he now gets jurisdiction over all Moslems except those who are British subjects, and so apparently does better than if he merely had jurisdiction over the subjects of Moslem Foreign Powers.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

I visited Dohah on the 3rd and 4th February and discussed this matter in detail with the Shaikh of Qatar. The Shaikh had with him his sons Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Ali and his Secretary Saleh A1 Mana. 3. I began by explaining the proposed alteration in the defi nition of a Qatar subject, concentrating at first on the change from 'national of any other Moslem State' to 'Moslem person'. It was at once evident that the Shaikh and his advisers were deeply suspicious and it took the best part of two hours to obtain their agreement even to this portion. Finally after two lengthy consulta tions at the other end of the room, they appeared to be satisfied that I had no deep under-hand object, designed to obtain greater transfer of jurisdiction than the Shaikh intended to give, and that I was not deceiving them when I said that the object was to make the criterion an individuals personal religion rather than the State religion of his country of origin. The Shaikh is evidently (Signature) very/-— 2 - © very frightened of King Ibn Saud and wanted me to give him a written assurance that the governments of foreign Moslem States would not object to his (i«e. the Shaikh*s) decisions in cases affecting non-British Moslems. I stated that he need have no anxiety provided he adheres to the principles of justice as re cognised in Mohammadan Law. 4. So far the discussion had been successful. No argument, however, would induce the Shaikh to agree to the exclusion of Corporations from this definition. He took his stand on the fact that there had been no mention of Corporations in previous discussions, and he said in effect that sooner than agree to this exception he would prohibit the formation or operation of any Moslem Corporation in Qatar. I was unable to make effective use of the arguments supplied in paragraph 2 of your Express letter under reference (in which the use of the word t, non-Moslem ,, is apparently an error), since it was evident that the Shaikh felt strongly that the persons or classes of persons over whom he had agreed to jurisdiction being exercised by Hix Majesty*s Government were exclusive and that he retained jurisdiction over all others. It is true that he had never asked for or proposed jurisdiction over Moslem Corporations; nor on the other hand had we. Since ordinarily a 'person 1 * includes a 'Corporation', the absence of any reference to a Moslem Corporation in previous discussions creates a presumption in favour of the Shaikh rather than in our favour. My personal view is that we should give way on this point. It seems to me highly improbable that any such Moslem Corporations would come into existence or operation in Qatar; and consequently no particular object is served by pur suing the point. In other v/ords it seems to me an error to pre judice the attainment of our main object by insisting on pro viding for something which may never exist or which in any event is of little or no interest. 5/-5 When I came to the matter of explaining the classes of persons in respect of whom jurisdiction would he exercised by the Political Agent, an even greater difficulty arose over the provision in Article 8(iii) of the draft Qatar Order-in- Council to the effect that the Political Agent would exercise jurisdiction, even if only through the Joint Court, over Qatar subjects registered as being in regular service of British sub jects or foreigners. Admittedly a similar provision exists in the Bahrain and Kuwait Orders-in-Council (a fact which did not appeal to the Shaikh as being of the faintest importance), but the Shaikh and his advisers were evidently convinced that the result, if not the object, of this clause is to nullify his jurisdiction over non-British Moslems. Once more he took his stand on the fact that nothing remotely approaching such a pro vision had been mentioned in any previous discussion or communi cation. It is essential to remember that in Qatar we deal with people who are so intensely suspicious that no ordinary process of reason can be expected to prevail unless the Shaikh and his advisers can see clear and definite advantage to themselves. Here again I would enquire if a provision of this nature is ac tually essential. I do not of course know whether this provi sion has been found of any advantage in Kuwait, but so far as Bahrain is concerned it is a dead letter. I am unable to dis cover that any Bahrain subject is or has ever been registered at the Agency as being in the service of a British subject or foreigner, and even the Adviser to the Bahrain Government was ignorant of the existence of this provision in the Bahrain Ofder- in-Council. I have now discovered that the ostensible purpose of this provision in the Bahrain Order-in-Council was to obtain jurisdiction over Bahrain subjects in the domestic service of Britishers or foreigners, though of course it might well be argued/--4- argued that 'regular service' is not exclusively restricted to domestic service. In fact as the phrase at present stands it could be extended to service of any form whatsoever, provi ded only that it is regular. Thus in Bahrain the position which exists, and has apparently always existed, is that Bah rain subjects are within the jurisdiction of the Shaikh. I suggest that the same might well apply in Qatar, even allowing for the fact that 'Qatar subject' includes non-British Moslem persons. So far as the latter are concerned I need only remark that there is no very obvious reason why Petroleum Concessions Limited, for example, should employ any non-British Moslem persons in 'regular service'. Even if service is held to be synonymous with employment, so far as the operations of the Company are concerned, disputes between the Company and its employees automatically come before the Joint Court, under the provision in Part V of the draft Qatar Order-in-Council, 6, Briefly therefore the position is as follows. The Shaikh of Qatar agrees to the substitution of Moslem Person (non-British) in place of 'national of any other Moslem State'. On the other two points I see no prospect of obtaining his ag reement without recouree to extreme pressure. It is for con sideration whether these two points are of sufficient import ance to warrant extreme action, particularly since this must have repercussions on the relations between the Shaikh of Qa tar and the Oil Company, and since, even if that action is successful, the feeling will I fear undoubtedly remain in Qa tar that the agreement made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with the Shaikh has been dishonoured by us. / Political Agent, BahrainNote of discussion with P.R. on 14th February 1S38. • • • The o x uestion of the Qatar Order in Council was briefly discussed, the main discussion being postnoned till tomorrow by which time P.R. will have seen the P.A*s latest letter on the subject.

On the third point I agree fully with the Political Agent’s comments.

At present the Sheikh of Qatar exercises jurisdiction over persons of every him under which we relieve him of his jurisdiction in respect of British subjects and British protected persons and other (non-ttioslem) foreigners. He thus retains jurisdiction over his own nationals and Moslem foreigners and he now asks us for assurances that he will not get into trouble because he exercises jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners. The real answer to this is that if he is troubled about this we are quite willing to take over the jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners from him but he does not want this. It is perhaps for consideration whether we should in our letter add something to the effect that if he v/ishes we are willing to take over the jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners. now is concerned, there is no practical difference between the two formulae i.e. whether ws say as previously proposed nationals of a Moslem State or Moslem foreigners; virtually all Saudi Arabians come under it anyhow, but if Ibn Sard has a few Christian nationals then the new definition is narrower than the old one.

Would you please refer to letter dated and numbered as above of the new Qatar Order-in-Council. &gt; / my official forwarding copies An error was detected, unfortunately after the Order had been made, in Article 90 (2) relating to the place of sale of printed copies. The Order was drafted originally by the Government of India (Foreign &amp; Political Department letter of the 20th August, 1936, No.F.483-N/35) on the basis of the Koweit Order-in-Council and in the Article referred to 'Koweit' had survived undetected till now. We would have preferred to substitute here 'Bahrein or Qatar' in order to cover both present and possible future contingencies. We were, however, informed by the Privy Council Office that, while there would be no objection to our substituting in ink one word for 'Koweit', the substitution of three words would require an amending Order-in-Council. It was felt desirable to avoid this course if possible and we have therefore Sir H.A.F. Metcalfe, KCIS., CSI., MVO., substituted/ Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi.© \4° substituted ''Bahrein 1 ' for 'Kov/eit' in the Article in question, Bahrein being the present location of the Office and Court of the Political Agent referred to in the Order. This of course does not prevent the Order from being put on sale in Qatar at any time that may be desirable or necessary. I am sending a copy of this letter to Towle and to Weightman. / 0111*3 (Sgd.)

Dear Eyres, I ol I understand that owing to the discovery of certain unfortunate errors in the Qatar Order-in- Council, it is proposed to repeal the Order early in February and substitute an amended Order for it.- 2. I now enclose a copy of the Order amended (a) so as to make the corrections required in Articles 4 and 8 in consequence of the omission of Article 8 (l)(a)(iii) of the original draft and (b) in accordance with suggestions made here by Sir y v Vernon Dawson, whom I consulted on the references to Indian laws, etc. , and a copy of whose rioter'll enclose. 3. With regard to paragraph 2 of Dawson 1 s note, the references to the Secretary of State in Articles 14, 15 and 38, which he particularly has in mind, are traditional, dating back at least to the Persian Coast and Islands Order, 1907. Time is short, and as no apparent harm can be done by leaving these j/assages unamended, I do not think we need pursue this matter in connexion with the Qatar Order. Other queries which Eyres, Esq. , Foreign Office, S. W. 1. he/2. ifQ he has raised are - (i) Article 55 ( 4 ). Is British lav; a recognised expression? Does it mean an Act of Parliament? (ii) Ar ticle 74- (a ). V/hat is the meaning of the last two lines of the first sab-paragraph? (I find that this Article dates from the Muscat Order-in-Council 1915 and was based on Muscat King’s Regulation No.1 of 1903, the relevant words in which ran:- ’'without due execution of signature and registration in His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate at Muscat previous to the transfer of such property.” In the light of this I have suggested an alteration in the order of the words. (iii). Article 75 (l) . Is ’’British Company” a term of art? Does it mean a Company registered in the United Kingdom? Perhaps you would be good enough to cee whether any amendment is thought necessary in connexion with (i) and (iii). 4. I suggest the opportunity might be taken to tidy up Article 4. Successive amendments of the model Article in the Persian Coast &amp; Islands Order have destroyed the original alphabetical order. Although it is unfortunate that we should have to repeal the Qatar Order so/so soon all the changes novv found necessary will he a guide in revising the Muscat Order-in-Council. 5. Please ensure the safety of the enclosed amended Order as I have not kept a duplicate of it. Yours sincerely. iSgdJ J. p. GIBSON( 4 )/ Note by Sir Vernon Dawson. The draftsman of this Order overlooked the following facts ;~ (1) That the expressions ,! Governor-Gener^.l in Council” and ’'local Government” are now obsolete in Indian Acts and that throughout the Indian Statute Book ’’Central Government” and ’’Provincial Government” have respectively been substituted for them by paragraph 4(1) of the Government of India (Adaptation of Indian Laws) Order* 1937; These expressions are* further, defined by the General Glauses Act as amended by the Adaptation Order. (2) that the expressions ’’enactments of the Governor- General of India in Council” and ’’enactments of the Governor of Bombay in Council” are at least twenty years out of date; ’’Indian Legislature” and ’’Bombay Legislature” are now the appropriate substitutes; (a) that ii 5 as is constantly done in the course of the Order? the Government of India are referred to as'the Governor-General of India in Council”, it ./ill oe necessary to amend that expression throughout the Order, and in all other similar Orders, as soon as Part II of the Government of India net, 1935? comes into force. I have? therefore, suggested a definition of “Governor- General and the substitution of ’’Governor- General” for ’’Governor-General of India in Council” wherever it occurs throughout the Order Uo intended bo descrioe 'une Executive Government in India;2 . r h \ V. X (4) that the Act of 1935 rendered the expression 'Presidency cf Bomhay” obsolete t Bombay, Bengal and Madras are now Provinces; and (5) the making of the Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order, 1937 (see paragraph 88(i) of this Order). 2. I have made the necessary corrections throughout the Order to give effect to these points, and have also posed other queries, drafting and otherwise, which I hope you will find intelligible, in particular I have queried the arrangement in several places in the Order which directs certain things to be done either by the Secretary of State or by the Government of India with his previous or subsequent approval. Is it really appropriate that any of these things should be done by the Secretary of State himself, and will he ever in fact do them ? Jould not the obvious thing in all these places be to say that the things in question shall be done by the Governor-General ? 3» I strongly urge the omission of paragraph 3 of the Order. It is surely almost unprecedented to have an index to an Order in Council (which in this particular case seems quite otiose having regard to the fact that you already tuve the Part headings printed in large type in the appropriate places) inserted in the middle of an Order amongst its operative provisions.By Air Mail.

Dear Eyres, In my letter of yesterday about the amendment of the Qatar Order in Council I included what purported to be a quotation from the Muscat King’s Regulation Fo, 1 of 1903. For the sake of accuracy perhaps I should say that we had only a draft of the Regulation on record here and that the phrase actually used in the published Regulation, of which we have received a copy this morning from the Foreign Offic was - 'without due execution of signature and registration, previous to the transfer of such property, in His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate at Muscat'.

British Agency, Doha, 20th September, 1950 You will recall that when you were visiting ^ hvLii'A* Qatar I questioned the interpretation of the expression 'Qatar Subject' in the Order-in-Council. Order-in-Council (Part 1 Artcile 4) is 'a subject of the Shaikh of Qatar or any Muslim person not being a British Subject'. My question concerns only the 'Muslim person'. I do not know what the intention or policy was at the time the Order was drawn up, but it seems to me that Muslem person can only be interpreted to mean one whose relgion is Islam. In other words it does not mean a subject of a Muslim State as in the case I believe in other Orders-in- Council. If this so it would follow that any Muslim not a British subject is a Qatar subject under the order-in- Council e.g. a French Muslim could be subject to the juris diction of the Shaikh of Qatar. 3. Apart from the need for a clear definition of this question to clarify any doubts that may arise if cases are brought to me, there is ^point of policy. As you know well, Qatar lacks skilled workers of all sorts, clerks,, mechanics, engineers and so on. Until the local population^educated it is therefore necessary to import these types or workers and a good proportion have so far come from that part of Palestine that is now Jordan. 4. It is in the interest of Qatar that this Ordo-y fUtUJ continue. If it is known, however, that a Christian Jor danian is subject to the jurisdiction of the Ruler of Qatar there may possibly be a drop in the number of people willing to come. It is well known that the amenities of Doha are very few, that the Adviser has not yet got the Government working properly and above all that there is no proper system of Justice. The Ruler is able to refuse to hear a case afti the Qadi is not a good man. It is therefore at great risk that a Christian Jordanian for example comes to Qatar, if the Order-in-Council is interpreted to mean that a subject of Muslim State is subject to the Ruler’s Jurisdiction. 5. I recommend that the expression 'Muslim person' in the Order be interpreted to mean that any person whatever his nationality whose religion is Islam is subject to the Ruler’s jurisdiction^ The chance of a Muslim from a country outside the Middle East wisiting Qatar and getting involved . in a Court case is so remote at present that we need not consider it. 2 The meaning given to this expression by the 6 I shall be grateful for your views R.

Would you please let us know what decision was reached? 2. The question has of course never Yours ever, Agency. The Political Residency, Jufair.BRITISH RESIDENCY BAHRAIN. (107/36/50) 14th October,.1950. f A’-* The qaestion,/6f jurisdiction in Qatar has been raised in the enclosure to Bahrain Agency's letter Ho.C/R-o05 of the 25th September. At present the Ruler has jurisdiction over any Muslim person not being a British subject. This is presumably based on some agreement reached with Shaikh Abdullah when we entered into rela tions with him in 1916 or subsequently, though I have not yet checked this. At any rate, so long as the present Order in Council remains in force it must be interpreted strictly, which means that a French Muslim would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Qatar and a Jordanian Christian to that of the Political Agent. 2. You may be interested to learn that the legal experts at the Foreign Office with their passion for uniformity are anxious that the Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar Orders in Council should be brought into line and that nationals of cer tain predominantly Muslim states should be made subject to the jurisdiction of the local Rulers. We shall probably receive instructions about this shortly. There should be no difficulty at Bahrain where the Shaikh's jurisdiction would be extended, but we may have some difficulty in persuading the Rulers of Kuwait and Qatar to accept the alterations proposed in their present powers.
