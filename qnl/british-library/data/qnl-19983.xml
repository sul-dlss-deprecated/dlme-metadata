If howerer State or quasi-State agricultural projects on a large scale are to he initiated the first essential is for the Bahrain Government to obtain control over all artesian water supplies in the island. At the moment terrifying quantities of good v/ater are being wasted, artesian wells have been sunk in extravagant profusion and many of them are not even provided with valves to shut off the flow. His Highness the Shaikh himself and the A1 Khalifah are among the worst offenders, and it will need considerable pressure, prefer ably originating in advice from His Majesty^ Government themselves, to induce His Highness to agree on his own account and to order other landowners to put their artesian supplies under Government control. It should not be a difficult task, though it may take some time and money, to ascertain by experiment the quantity of v/ater required to irrigate a specific area for a specific crop in any particular locality in Bahrain. Cnce this is done all artesian wells should be fitted with locked valves and meters, and it should be the business of a properly conducted Government Department to flow each well to the quantity required weekly. In certain areas it will be necessary to construct cement reservoirs, into which the flow from artesian wells can be directed, in order to make a sufficient head of v/ater to irrigate more distant areas. I am not normally in favour of State control over any privately-owned facility, but 1 do greatly fear the oartial exhaustion of reserves of artesian water under Bahrain if the present lack of control continues. It becomes a matter of even greater importance if an extension of agriculture on a commercial scale comes under contemplation. I have on more than one occasion already urged-the need for taking periodic readings of the flow of old and new artesian wells in different localities. X .

CONFI DENTIAL RECOnDS Will you please refer to the correspondence resting with my demi-oiricial letter No. C/26^ dated the 1st April ±940 in regard to the Bahrain Water Supplies ? 2. I enclose herewith a copy or a report on the water resources or Bahrain which has been made by the Oil Company, Investigations have not proceeded over a sufficient period or years to enable really definite conclusions to be drawn, but the report discloses a situation which is quite suniciently alarming. I had always hoped against hope that the deeper water zone (described as zone n C M in the report) would provide a fair reserve or good water for Bahrain for the future but that hope has now been destroyed. 3. There is only one effective way, to my mind, of dealing with the water question in Bahrain, and that is to put locked Vdlves on all artesian wells. There should be a committee to examine and report on the minimum quantity or water required at ail 1 erent secisons to irrigate land already under cultivation^ and a water conservancy staff should be appointed to open up artesian wells lor a suil'icient period each week to provide that minimum quantity. Unfortunately this is Utopian. The worst offender so far as water wastage is concerned is Shaikh Hamad himself, ardently supported oi course by the unpleasant gentry to whom he has given gardens and lands, and I see no possibility of ever convincing him - until the water runs out - that we cannot rely indefinitely on the benevolence of uod to maintain an unlimited supply of artesian water in Bahrain. We can /- Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel C. u. Prior, C. I. E., Political Resident in the Persian uulf, Bushire. - . tc an 9 think, only hope that there will not be too serious a drop in the static head before Shaikh Hamad leaves us, and be prepared to call on the next Shaikh to introduce some such system as I have suggested above. Meanwhile I have myself continued in season and out of season to drag the water question into any conversation v/ith members of the Al Khalifah Family and I will advise Alban to carry on with this. I am also writing to Belgrave, to whom a copy of this report has been sent, to draw his attention once more to the seriousness of this problem, to urge on him the maintenance of strict pro hibition on new drilling and to propose that at the least the flow from artesian wells in the Manama Municipal area be carefully restricted once the new Town V/ater Supply is ready. (That scheme provides for linking a certain number of wells - three in the first instance - to flow into a central reser- | voir and pumping therefrom to all parts of the Town either direct or via a high-level tank according to the season). From now onwards drilling should be confined strictly to genuine public need, i.e. in the way of providing drinking water for the towns. 4. In saying that the report discloses a serious situation I do not mean to suggest that I foresee any likelihood of the whole artesian source expiring in the immediate future but the impression one gets is that 15 or 20 years hence the static head will drop to the point where pumping becomes necessary.wathr kilsoukcas 0* bahkaij)] it3lahds Introduc tion ih is report is concerned with the sources or domestic v^&amp;ter on Hahrain Island and an attempt to evaluate these sources with respect to their productivity and their ability to sustain production. Discussion will be limited to those sources outside the 'Rim Rock' as being of primary value. Sources within the 'Rim Rock' are relatively unimportant as compared with those outside, and are furthermore, of dirierent origin. Water within the 'Rim Rock' is obtained at a rather uni form elevation and appears to be fresh by virtue of an en- filtration of rain water which floats on top of denser salt water contained in the formation. as the rate and volume of water withdrawal from wells in this area is increased, the salt content should increase regardless of withdrawals or contamina tion at other points. Also, in years of heavy rainfall the salt content might be expected to drop slightly. Summary and Hecnmmpnri ations There are three water producing zones on the Island. 01 these three. Zone 'B' is the most important and furnishes the great majority of the potable water. Neither Zone 'A' nor Zone 'C' has been isolated olten enough to furnish conclusive prool ot its individual worth. It is recommended that in the future, every ellort be made to collect data on these horizons. Salt contents of water increase as one goes from north to south on the island, with the more rapid increase on the east side. Information on this problem is sadljt lacking south of Zellaq. and south ol the refinery area. Every effort should be made to gather evidence pertinent to this condition. It is said that scattered wells have been drilled in the area south of /- I t &amp; ii - 2 - of the refinery in the past; but there is no record or formations penetrated, salt contents of waters (except that they were extremely salty), nor even of locations. There has been a drop in static heads of wells, over a period of years, and it would seem that the rate of drop is slightly less in the last two years than previously. The Company should continue observations in the refinery area and at Zellaq. It is believed that possibly because of formation changes and porosity differences, the structurally higher Zellaq and Refinery area wells will probably show a raster rate of drop than wells in the north and north-west part of the island. As a check on this, it is suggested that some agency be esta blished whose duty it would be to accumulate proper water records not only in Bahrain, but also in Muharraq. Tide differences affect the static head of wells, and this should be taken into account in the establishing of accurate water head measurements. Water Producing Horizons Classiiication There are three general water producing zones in the area outside the 'Rim Hock' and for the sake or this report, these will be known, from top to bottom, as Water Zone 'A', Water Zone f, B n and Water Zone 'C'. Water Zone 'A n is the first substantial limestone body encountered in the drilling of wells outside the 'Rim Rock'. This body may be encountered anywhere from 20 to 100 feet beneath the surface and its thickness may be anywhere irom 40 to 150 feet. Beneath /- mmi Beneath Zone 'A' and separated from it by 25 to 50 feet of clay, lies Water Zone 'B'. This Zone 'B' occurs within a limestone body 100 to 150 feet thick and as the available evidence indicates that the source, or at least the chief source of water in this zone, is the upper 40 feet of the body, it is this portion with which we are primarily concerned. Beneath the limestone body in which Zone 'B n is found, is a third limestone series, the two being separated by a shale interval of slightly more than 30 feet. The upper 50 feet or so of this third limestone body is the portion we are interested in, and it will be known as Water Zone M E n . Areal Extent There is a belt at a low elevation around the outer edge of the island within which (with the possible exception of a strip along the southeastern shore) it is possible to obtain water from at least a portion of the three zones described in this report. How far inland this belt extends is not known exactly, although it is probable that the series of springs and shallow wells which irrigate the date gardens farthest inland define roughly its innermost edge. The information now available does not permit determination as to whether this edge is limited by the water head or by the pinching out of the individual water bearing horizons. Water Zone 'A ' Within the limestone |)ody which has been designated as Zone 'A', there are ordinarily two producing intervals, although where this section is thin, as at Zellaq, there may be only one, and at Umm Sabaan where the section is thick, we have three such intervals. These are waters of low static head and they do not always rlow. Since the deeper /-MSBmmM * — /O - 4 deeper Zone 'B' is usually the goal or drilling water wells, there is very little inTorraation as to how much water Zone 'A' would produce if put on the pump or simply allowed to llow Tor a considerable time in the manner in which the lower lormation is produced. A simple comparison or visible rate or rlow of this water with the flow from Zone 'B' is not very encouraging, but a pumping test might be very enlightening. Two fair examples of the occurrence of these upper waters were observed in Zellaq water well ^ 2 and in Umm Sabaan. At Zellaq, water flowed from the time the hole was SO feet deep. This rlow was at first slightly brackish, but as the hole cleaned out, became fresh. There was no change until the large flow was encountered at 97 feet in Water Zone 'B'. At Umm Sabaan, a small flow of water was encountered at 63 feet, just under the top or the limestone body. This water had a static head of 3 feet. At 81 feet, a good flow was obtained which increased until a depth of 85 feet was reached. From 85 feet to 115 feet, there was no increase, but at 115 feet water increased slightly. The well then flowed 109 barrels per hour, with a static head or 7 feet 3 inches above ground level. This water tested 1750 parts per million of chlorides. At 272 feet. Zone 'B' was topped and the flow increased to 1000 barrels per hour, with a static head of 13.8 feet above ground level. This water tested 1450 ppm. NaCl. It is not unusual to obtain water from the top of a limestone body which is overlain by a shale, as is the case of the first waters in Ztllaq ^ 2 and Umm Sabaan. Such occur rences may be anticipated to some extent, ■'■n the case of the other waters noted in Umm Sabaan, one is KHHiUBiHH confronted with slightly different conditions in that there is no visible shale /- J , 4shale break above them, although assuredly there is some sort of impervious bed to confine the waters. Similar water hori zons within Zone 'A' are found at the Portugese Fort and in the Raiya well on Muharraq; but in the dirferent wells, the waters appear at different points within the limestone body. One is thus forced to the conclusion that the body is a single unit within which waters are confined at various points entirely because of local difference in porosity. It is evi dent that to try to anticipate these occurrences would be very difficult, if at all possible. It is conceivable that if data were available on enough holes, some order might assert itself in these occurrences. The waters of Zone 'A' seem to follow rather well on a comparison of quality, with the waters of zones below. In areas where one is good, generally the other is good also. In the south part of the island where the water from below is very baa, the water in Zone 'A' is even worse. Water Zone Water Zone tT B' occurs at depths of from 100 to 300 feet and is overlain by a shale which runs from 25 to 50 feet thick, usually yellow in colour. The zone is generally re cognised by the quantity of water which flows frcbm it and the increase in head over waters above. Also, the formation is usually so friable that small crystalline fragments of limestone continue to flow out in the water for some time after the horizon is penetrated. It has definite charac teristics under a microscope which would add nothing to the layman*s appreciation of it and therefore need not be enumera ted here. This zone produces the bulk of the water on Bahrain Island. So far as is known, this horizon is everywhere present around the edge of the island with the possible exception/- - IF—- - 6 - exceplion of a portion of the east side south of Sitra, and furnishes water in drilled wells from Sitra around the north of the island and to a point several kilometers south of Zellaq- Information is scant from Zellaq around the south tip of the island and back up to Sitra. The formation was re cognisable at Ras al Barr although no definite production of water was observed from It. At Umm Mattala between Zellaq and Ras al Barr, there are only a few scattered samples and random-bits of information; but it is almost certain from what there is that conditions at Umm Mattala are much the same as at Ras al Barr. There is no positive information at all from Ras al Barr up to Sitra, but at Sitra Zone 'B' is again producing satisfactory volumes of water, although the salt content is relatively high. The inconsistencies of this formation are easily seen, but it remains by far the most pro lific source of ptable water on the island. There are more or less definite areas where it can be depended upon to furnish great quantities, and for this part of the world, excellent qualities of water. Water Zone 'C' Water Zone 'C !l is usually found from 150 to 200 feet below Zone 'B' although in some instances this interval may decrease to as little as 100 feet. The zone often produces volumes of water comparable to those of Zone 'B n , and with nearly the same static head; but the quality is seldom, if ever, as good. There are very few wells which are definitely known to be producing from this horizon; but in wells on which there is information, the water often has a strong hydrogen sulphide odour. Salt contents where information is available, are usually higher in this zone than in aones above. Specifically, there are wells on the north and west sides of the island which we suspect have penetrated this formation /- I ■V/3 - 7 - formation, and which do not show an unduly high salt con tent; as for example, a well located some six kilometers north of Zellaq and reported belonging to the Secretary to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad. On the other hand, Ras al Barr and Umm Mattala are excellent examples of a combination of high salt content and hydrogen sulphide in water from this zone. These wells might be excluded on the grounds that they are in the area which geographically is without any good water; but at Fasht al Jarim we have a case of good water in all horizons down to Zone '•C', but the same combination of high salt content and hydrogen sulphide from this horizon. The safest attitude towards this zone is to disregard this zone as a source of water except as a last resort. Quality of Waters It is important to note that although there is con siderable variation in the quality of water obtained in various parts of the island, there does seem to be s ome system to the variation. In the Sitra-Malamir area, salt contents of water run around 4 to 5 thousand parts per million with only Zone 'A' and Zone 'B' open. On the north end of Sitra Island, salt contents run from 2983 down to 1989 parts per million. One can only guess from volume of flow and general practice, that Zone 'A' and Zone 'B' are open in these wells. The volume of water and static head are such as to suggest that this is true. From scantyfacts and local reports, we see the salt contents continue to drop gradually as we go around the northeast corner of the island and on to the west. At the Portugese Fort, analysis shows 1504 parts pens million with all three zones open. There was no noticeable production of water from Ap- I 1. : t 1 1 t-;.- 1! - 8 - from Zone 'C M in this well and no appreciable change in salt contents as the hole went down, so clearly Zone 'B' dominates the 'ilgoduction in this hole regardless of both other zones being open. Westward, at Bediya, there is a well, the water analysis of which shows 1316 parts per million of chlorides. This is the lowest salt content of which there is a record for this type of well. As one goes south from Bediya, figures show that the salt contents are rising again and by the time Zellaq is reached they are up to 1700 ppm., with Zone H A M and 'B' open. In the new gardens south of Zellaq, chloride contents run from 1696 ppm., in the northernmost wells, to 2047 in the \ southernmost. This scheme is purely geographical so far, and the picture is simply one of increasing salinity south wards, with the more rapid increase on the east side of the island. There is some indication, although no defin ite proof, that structural position may have some influence upon the quality of water. In certain instances, structu ral position and quality of water appear directly related although the relationship has not the consistency of the geographical comparison by any means. Whether this is significant or not remains to be seen. STATIC HEAD OF WELLS In some cases there has been, over a period of several years, a notable drop in static head of wells pro ducing from Zone 'B 11 . There is not a great deal of accurate information on this score, but in the vicinity of Zellaq and in the refinery area, some records have been kept. In the refinery area, wells at Sitra and at Malamir offer the best examples for observing normal conditions, since wells /-or - 9 - ■ ells at the refinery proper are operated under conditions that make observation difficult. Wells at Malamlr, over the recent period since September 1938, when regular observations were begun, register no definite drop In head. Measurements show that recent observations are within a tenth of a foot of the highest observed in the two year period. The measurements show 8 series of ups and downs, but they are all within the range of what is now recognized as tidal Influence. In other words, the static level of the wells goes up *hen the tide is high and drops when the tide is low. Sinqe these recent figures are recorded without reference to ti dal differences, there is every good reason to believe that all the differences recorded in this two year period are simply differences in tidal influence. In a recent twenty-four hour test, it was found that the static level of water Well ^9 at Malamlr varied as much as 0.61 ft. from high to low tide. When one considers the original head of the well when completed in June 1936, as related to the present water levels, a definite drop is apparent. Comparing the ori ginal head of five feet with the most recent figures, reduced to the same datum, it is found that the static level has dropped between 1.74 and 2.35 feet. These limits are made necessary by the fact that the original measure ments did not consider the tidal influence. On this basis a figure of 0,435 to 0.587 feet per year drop in static head is calculated. At Sitra isuks, Water Well / 5 shows a smaller raue of decline. This well wes reported as having a head of three feet on its completion March 22, 1936. Recent observations show that there is 1.02 of a foot variation in this well due to tide influence. On this basis, a drop of from 0.31 to 1.33 feet is calculated from March 1936 A-J/4 - 10 - 1936 to July 1940, or a yearly drop of 0.0716 to 0.307 feet. If it is assumed that the rate of drop will remain similar, this well will flow above ground level from 9 to 38 years. Malamir Water Well ^ 9, using the same method of calculating, will flow above ground for 6 to 8 years. In all likelihood however, other factors remaining the same, this life span should be lengthened by a slight drop in rate of decline as the head drops and less water is produced. In the vicinity of Zellaq, records have been kept on a number of wells over the last year, but only on the Company % water wells at Zellaq Pumping Station are there records over a sufficient length of time to show any great amount of decline. Over a period of 7-3/4 years, from July 1932 to April 1940, the rate of drop in head on Water Well ^ 2 at Zellaq has been one foot per year. By using the figures from July 11, 1939 to April 1940, a figure of 0.5 foot per year is obtained. Water Well ^ 16 shows a slightly smaller rate of decline. From its completion in October 1936, to April ^7, 1940, it showed a drop of 0.786 ft. per year, while over the same perbd. Water Well / 2 declined at the rate of 0.9 ft. per year. From July 1939, to April 1940, ^ 15 has declined at the rate of 0.4 ft. per year. Other wells in the general area which have been measured over the last year, show a rate of decline of 0.88 ft. per year when six representative wells are averaged. It must be noted that all of these figures are subject to correction, since none of them take into account the variations which occur in the heads due to tide influence. This difference due to tidal influence is approximately 0.5 ft. in the only well in that area where it has been measured5 but until more information on that point can be gathered, it is necessary to consider the figures available. There are three main points of consideration for the data at hand. First /-First, a rate of decline over a period of 7-3/4 years which is probably higher than the present rate of decline. Second, a rate over a shorter recent period which is half the first and possibly too low» In the third place, there is the average rate for six wells over the last year, and this figu^p of 0.88 ft, per year seems to be the most logi cal choice for a working figure on the present rate of de cline, although one must still consider its limitations due to tide. As already mentioned, there has been actually measured at Sitra and at Zellaq, differences in static level of the water of 1»02 ft. and 0.5 ft. respectively, within one tide cycle. There is some reason to believe that on the north end of the island there is a variation of a foot or more due to this tidal influence. These differences must be taken into consideration if an accurate rate of drop is calculated. Therv are very meagre data on wells on the north end of the island, but it has been observed that wells which are low structurally, have relatively high heads. Conse quently, these v. ells on the north end should maintain their water production better than wells to the south which are higher structurally.

I have the honour to inform v our Highness of the following facts regarding the drop in head of various artesian wells in Bahrain, v/hich has been measured by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. In 1936, the well at Malamir had a head of 5 feet. This head has now dropped from between 1.74 to 2.35 feet. At Sitra the v/ater level is also dropping year by year and it is calculated that this well will continue to flow above ground level from 9 to 38 years more. Malamir well will continue to flow above the ground for another 6 to 8 years only. At Zellaq the rate of drop in one of the wells has been 1 foot per year and it seems likely that this well will be dry soon.

Dear Mr. Belgrave, 'bv Zellaq Water Supply Attached is a study of the ^ellaq Water Supply compiled by our Petroleum iSngineers. Several times in the past you have asked for information on this subject and v;e are herewith submitting a review of the water situation on the Zellaq side of Bahrain Island. Would appreciate any comments you may have regarding the possibility of reducing the loss of irrigation water to the sea as,in course of time,indiscriminate use will affect not only the company's supply of domestic water but also the Sheikhs' supply for irrigation. Yours very truly, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited M.H.Lipp Chief Local Representative. Mr. H # H,Lipp; Memorandum Producing Department, November 24,1941. Zellao Water Supnly N ,W The satic head in the water producing zones which are the main source of dome^stic water supply for .the Inland has been decreasing for a number of years. For details o f this decrease please refer to i-r. G.W. Gulmon's report entitled 'Water Resources of Bahrain' dated May 12,1941. In particul.,^ the static head in the vicinity of Zellaq has shown a marked dedrease, and it has been tiaarr recently unofficially brought to our notice that^ the owners of the gatdens whose wells have been affected attrifyite the consequent reduction in water production to the fact that the Company obtain water for field and domestic use from wells sunk in this area. Although we do not contend that prodjction of water for Company use will in no way affect other wells producing from the same source, we believe that the volume of water involved is so small in comparison with the large volume pro duced ,for irrigation purposes in the same area that its in fluence on the static head would be almost negligible. In the narrow strip of coast line extending for approximately two miles notth to approximately two miles south of Zellaq^there are more than 40 wells, many vjf which are not even provided witha control gate. The water produced by these wells is estimated at approximately half a million barrels per day, a large percentage of which flows into the sea from drainage ditches. ■ order to ascertain the volume of water runnin?' into the sea, a survey was conducted November 2 and 3,194l' along the coast line under discussion and the actual flow of water m the drainage ditches was measured. The datet obtained is attacned m tabulated summary and detailed form and the looations of the ditches referred to in the tabu- ' dr ' e snown on the accompanying sketch ma-o. f f■■MB The flow of water in the drainage ditches was determined 'by selecting a reach of uniform cross-section,measuring the width of the ditch and the depth of the water and determining the velocity by timing a surface float over a measured distance by means of a stop-watch. In calculating the rates of flow from these figures it has been assumed that the mean velocity of flow is 0.9.of the surface velocity (a conservative coeffi cient ). Water samples were obtained from the drainage ditches for salinity determination and, where possible,water samples were also obtained from the source of supply in order to observe the amount of salt taken up into solution during the passage of the water through the gardens. These data are also shown in the attached tabulation of results. This investigation has revealed the fact that over 200^000 barrels/day of water was runni.v* into the sea from the various ditches at the time measured and, although a certain amount of salt is picked up by the water, that the salinity is such that it is still suitable for irrigation purposes. The amount of water taken from Zellaq wells for Company operations is approximately 13,000 bbls/day which in comparison with the amount of water wasted, is veiy small. Many of the 40 wells referred to above have been drilled within recent time and the marked decline in static head apparently coincides with the extensile cultivation which has developed in this area. The flow of water through the porous media of the water bearing strata,whether to a single well or to a number of wells in an area, must be accompanied by the establishment of a hydraulic gradient to promote that flow. The hydraulic gradient depends upon the rate of flow and, a state of equilibri um will be attained for any one rate of withdrawal. Since the Hirediced and that the greater the rate of withdrawal the greater the redaction in static head. In the Zellaq area it is evident that the rate of water withdrawal is such that the hydraulic gradient necessary to promote the flow in the porous media has resulted in a reduction of static head in that area to a point where some of the existing wells, once prolific,will not flow, or atleast flow at a very much reduced rate. The drilling of other wells to effect this reduced rate of flow will only farther reduce the static head, will undoubtedly encourage greater waste and result in existing flowing wells being farther reduced in productivity. This latter statement is emphasized because one new well has Just oeen completed at ^ubiliyat, another situated less than a mile north o l ZellaQ. has Just been started and, we understandj a third well is to be drilled south of zellaq.

I am afraid it will not have any marked effect. The land in question belongs to His Tr ighness himself and is part of a very large area extending from 3adad down the coast sovth of Zellaq. ^is Highness has a document for this land from his father Sheikh Isa.

I have spoken repeatedly to His Highness and the Shaikhs about the waste of water. Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa,who does not own any land there,is the only person v.ho appreciates the position, he agrees that water is being wasted. The gardeners themselves have told me that in some cases they had enough water and did not need new wells which His Highness insisted on drilling I will take up the question with him again on his return, but T think it is a matter in which a letter frorr you to His Highness or to me ( in English and Arabic ) would be helpful. If the gardens belonged to any other people it would be easy for the {Stc.tc to control them, but under the circumstances it is extremely difficult to obtain any results. l ajor.H.e.E.v* Alban,O.B^., Yours sincerely, Sd - rv» c. -K 'ff ^S 1111633 3halk li Sir Hamad Alkhalifah and the Senior ohaiklis» ■f-nr\r* :W- I have received a long report fror\ the Bahrain Petroleum Company which has been made by their water engineer about the ..ellaq water supply. A copy of this has been sent to the Political Agent. my water In this arec has been decreasing for some years. The reckon for trie decrease of water is the amount of water which is being taken out of the ground in artesian wells between Sadad and Zellaq. ihere ere over 40 artesian wells in the strip of ground extend- ring - or approximately two miles north to approximately 2 miles souuh 01 Zellaq.. I : any of these wells have not been provided with a control gauge. The water produced by these wells is approximately % iiiillion bcrrels a day of which a large percentage flows into the sea xrom drainage ditches. The water'was measured by the engineers v --o conduc ue 1 a survey ox vater in that area during themonth of -'ovember . It appears that over 200,000 barrels of water was running into the sea every day; some of this water was almost fresh and contained practically no salt,from which it would appear that it could be used for irrigation. rhe ^i-ccrs state that the decrease in water will be ''reater ■ imt: goe^ on and that it is likely that soome of these wells which now contain water will become dry. Each time a new well is - drilled the decrease in water would be hastened. Thti cmount o_ water taken from the Zellaci v/ells for comDanv operations is approximately 13.000 barrels a day, which, in comparison with the amount of water which is wasted,is very small.

Chief Local Representative, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED. 'Srtracts from Memorandum entitled 'Water Resources of Bahrein Island' by Mr* Max Steineke, California Arabian Standard Oil Company, dated Bahrein Island, July 15. 1942. INTRODUCTION While waiting for transportation to the United States in the earlier part of July, 1942, the writer spent about a week in field and office studies of the water resources of Bahrein Island, The following memorandum is a hurried writing on his observations on the problem. Arrangements have been made for Dr. R. A. Bramkamp to write a final report on the structure of Bahrein Island when the present Bapco structure drilling program is complete. In that report the water resources of the Island will be thoroughly discussed and more accurate data on the problem will be available. Sxtract No.l WATER RiSSOURCSS RELATION OF WATER TO STRATIGRAPHY &amp; STRUCTURE ; On Bahrein Island there are three important water zones and their stratigraphic positions are as follows: 1. Water Zone A (Miocene - Top Zone A and Top Eocene - Base Zone A). Distribution of this member is variable because of the unconformity between the Eocene and Miocene. 2. Impervious Member - Grey Shale ('Orange Marl') - 30 to 70 feet thick. Wide regional distribution. 3. Water Zone B - Brown Crystalline Limestone - Nummulitic Limestone, Porous series 100 to 150 feet thick - Regional distribution, 4. Impervious Member - Shark Tooth Shale - 6 to 8 feet thick. Regional distribution, 5. Water Zone C - Chalky Zone and lower beds. Regional distribution, SOURCE OF WATER AND PRESSURES - REGIONAL : The sources of the water from Zones A, B, &amp; C are evidently from the Hadhramaut, interior of Arabia, and the Syrian desert. However, it is possible that some of the water from the deeper zones might be coming from Iran, Iraq, etc. However, for the present discussion it is most reasonable to assume that the sources of the water are from the interior of Saudi Arabia, The average regional water gradient rises to the west at a rate of from 4 to 6 feet per mile. In general it might be stated that the intake of the water is from elevations of 1000 ft, to 1500 ft. High pressure artesian wells are not found on the coastal region area of Bahrein because of the inability of the upper Eocene and Miocene rocks to hold high pressures and, therefore, the head is lost along its path of migration down dip.Normally at sea level on the east coast of Arabia the static head of the water in the Socene rocks is from about 35 to 50 feet. However, in areas where there is evidently local leakage the pressure drops below the above average. In the Bahrein region the static head ranges from practically sea level on the southern portion of the Island to about 20 feet in local areas on the north portion of the Island. In the north portion of the Island the static level probably averages around 12 feet. In the eastern Persian Gulf region the pressures in A, B &amp; C Zones may be the same in one area or they may all be different. This evidently depend largely on local porosity of the rocks and the character of the impervious members separating the major water zones. SALINITY OF WATERS - REGIONAL ; Zone C V/ater . - This water is generally high in total salts on the coastal region except on the central portion of Dammam Dome where the water has evidently been sweetened by local intake of fresh water. In the interior of Saudi Arabia near the intake the water is very low in salts - below 250 ppm in many cases. Zone B Water , - The salinity of Zone B water varies from place to place. At Ras Tanura it is highly saline but from Dammam Dome to Jubail it is sweet - 2000 ppm or less. However, west of Jubail and in the Abu Hadriya region it is highly saline. We have no satisfactory explanation for the erratic regional distribution of the sweet and salty waters in Zone B, Zone A Water , - The salinity of waters from Zone A varies considerably from place to place. However, in general the areal extent of sweet water in this zone is much larger than that in Zone B, For example, sweet water is found in Zone A at Ras Tanura and in most of the Abu Hadriya region but Zone B water is highly saline. On the other hand, upper Zone A (Miocene) might be extremely salty whereas basal Zone A is sweet. This is evidently due to local conditions which are caused by intermingling with sea water or solution of salt in the formation in the vicinity, LOCAL WATER CONDITION (BAHRAIN) : Zone C Water , - In Bahrein this water is everywhere too saline to be of domestic value except possibly for cooling purposes. The hydrostatic head is evidently a few feet higher than that of Zone A or B, The Chalky Zone and beds below which contains Zone C water are apparently quite porous and very large volumes of water could be obtained from this source. The data at Bahrein indicate that the water of Zone C is isolated to this zone and that it is stopped from migrating upward by the impervious Shark Tooth Shale, There is a possibility, however, that the thinness of the Shark Tooth Shale has allowed migration at Zone C water into higher horizons thereby contaminating the higher water in the southern portion of the Island,Zone B Vater . ^ The Brown Crystalline Limestone - Nuranulitic Limestone series, which contains B-Zone water, has a very wide distribution over the coastal region of Saudi Arabia as well as over the Bahrein and Q,atar peninsula region. The Zone B water is undoubtedly the most consistent source of sweet water over the western Persian Gulf region. However, as stated before in this memorandum, the zone contains highly saline water in many place. In the north portion of Bahrein Island, Zone B contains sweet water generally testing between 1500 and 2000 ppm as sodium chloride. On the southern portion of the Island the water from the same stratigraphic horizon is highly saline, extract No,2 RELATION OF T A r AT2R BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF BAHREIN ISLAND The fact that the static head of the water decreases and also the fact that the salinity of the water increases in going from the northern portion of the Island to the southern portion has been emphasized repeatedly in various previous reports and letters. In the writer^ opinion the drop in pressure is due fundamentally to erosion to sea level, or practically to sea level, of the aquifer (water bearing) beds. In other words, the north portion of the Island is bordered by a slightly elevated series of strata which carries the water zones and which forms a horseshoe-shaped fringe around this portion of the Island, The open ends of the horseshoe-shaped fringe is truncated to sea level by erosion and therefore it is open to the sea. Naturally the pressure would drop under these conditions, F u rthermore, the sea water would intermingle with the fresh water in the general area where this exposure is present. Tidal effects are noted several miles from the areas where the strata are truncated and exposed to the sea. This is quite obvious in the Refinery - Sitra Island district which is several miles north of shore where sea water encroaches on the Brown Crystalline Lime aquifer near Ousaila, This tidal effect shows sub-surface surging of sea water to and fro which would obviously cause mixing of the sea and fresh v/ater. In the Zellaq district similar conditions are apparently present but the geology is more obscure here because of the covering of Quaternary sediments in the vicinity. Under these conditions fresher water should be found down dip and the maximum contamination should be found where the eroded edges of the aquifer strata are exposed to the sea. However, where the Miocene and upper Eocene strata are thin the whole aquifer series might be contaminated by sea water. Encroachment of the sea water will undoubtedly continue northward as erosion progresses. This is an extremely slow process involving geologic time and would naturally not affect our operations. However, rapid withdrawals of fresh water would naturally tend to create a flow of sea water from south to north. Here again the question arises as to how fast the withdrawals could be made without drawing in sea water. This would depend on the rapidity of replenishment of fresh water from the northern sector.There is no way of estimating how much fresh water is being wasted by overflow through the open ends (south end) of the horseshoe-shaped fringe of aquifer strata bordering the northern portion of the Island. The questions that arise are: 1. Is the weight of the sea water of the southern portion of the Island sufficient to balance the slight head of fresh water of the northern portion of the Island? In other words, is there an equilibrium be tween salt and sweet water in the Island district as a whole? 2. Is there a southward flow of sweet water into the sea and thereby cause large scale wastage of sweet water? 3. Is the withdrawal of sweet water in the northern portion of the Island sufficient to create a flow of salty water from south to north? In the writer^ opinion the salt and fresh water have reached more or less an equilibrium throughout geological time, that is as erosion progressed the artesian pressure of the sweet water has been reduced to balance an equal column of salt water. Large withdrawals of sweet water, at present would naturally create a flow of salt water from south to north. Marginal wells, or wells high structurally would naturally tend to draw in salt water more rapidly than wells down dip because the area of withdrawal would be less due to drainage from only a semi-circular area and also these areas would be more excessible to the weathered and cavernous rocks and therefore the surging tidal condition would be more effective. Because of the limited time spent on the Bahrein water problem, the above questions have been considered only hurriedly by the writer and a more thorough study should be made of these conditions. SUlv-MARY AND RSC0MM2NDATIONS 1. The writer agrees with Gulmon and Hurry and others that there is a pressure drop and an increased salinity in going from the northern portion of the Island to the southern portion of the Island. 2. The writer believes that erosion to sea level of the Eocene rocks down to the Brown Crystalline Limestone (Zone-B) has caused the above drop in pressure and the increase in salinity of the water in the southern portion of the Island. Wells down dip or located low structurally have a good chance of containing fresh water except in areas where the upper strata are thin as is the case between the southern part of Bahrein Island and Qatar, 3. Salty water in the southern portion of the Island might be due to the thinness of the Shark Tooth Shale and therefore rendering this impervious member incapable to stop upward migration of Zone-C waters to Zone-B and higher zones. This problem should be studied in more detail.4. The Buri Anticline and Buri Syncline are superficial structures probably caused by solution of strata in the Chalky Zone and subsequent slumping of the overlying beds. These structures are believed to have a strong bearing on the accumulation and flow of water on Bahrein Island. The age of the slumping should be carefully studied because this has a bearing on distribution of the types of sediments deposited in any given area which in turn has a bearing on the water problem. 5. The Buri Anticline and Buri Syncline should be mapped as accurately as possible in the field. Because of Dr. R. A. Bramkamp f s thorough knowledge of the stratigraphy of this region he should be assigned to the problem. A thorough study should be made of as many of the native wells as possible of the B a hrein district by the portable electrolog devised by Mr.R.Godfrey. 6. The Bahrein Government should be informed of the careless methods used by the drilling contractors in finishing native water wells. A surface string of about 20 feet is believed bad practice. Over the coastal region of Saudi Arabia, the static head in Zones A and B often varies considerably. Therefore, in many cases there might be flowage from Zone B to Zone A, or into Quaternary sediments. Native wells with small flows or dry holes may have a considerable flow from Zone B to Zone A and thereby causing a wastage of water and needless lowering the pressure of Zone B. Therefore, wells should be either completed as Zone A wells or Zone B wells. Zone A wells should not be deeper than the Grey Shale ( w 0range Marl'). Zone B wells should have the producing string set in the Grey Shale and production limited to the Brown Crystalline Limestone Series (Aquifer Zone B). 7. The heavy production from Zone B in the Refinery area and the high structural position of these water wells may affect the static head of Zone B water for a considerable radius from the Refinery wells. It is possible that the water levels of the adjoining date gardens located on the Grey Shale Outcrops might be affected. The Barbura and Kathira gardens are located on the Grey Shales and the water is probably coming up through fractured and weathered zones in the overlying Grey Shale Series, If this is the case a lowering of the Zone B water of the general district would obviously affect the springs of these two villages 0 However, springs in the villages of Shabatha, Kowaikab and Farsiyah are located in the White Lime Series and therefore should not be affected by the large withdrawal of water at the Refinery from Zone B. However, lowering of the water level in Zone B might affect Zone A indirectly by drainage and overflow of Zone B waters. This latter possibility is remote and should be considered as only a suggestion. A further study of the geology in the Refinery district should be made and withdrawals of water and their affect on the local water level should be studied carefully. The writer suggests that if the withdrawal of water at the Refinery is found excessive then the production should be reduced and a part of the Refinery water supply should be pumped in from wells farther down dip like those on the northern portion of Sitra Island. 8. The small withdrawals of water by the Company in the Zellak district should not have any effect on the water wells in the adjoining date gardens. The water resources of Bahrein Island should be studied more carefully. The contents of this hurriedly prepared memorandum should be considered as preliminary and only an outline of the problems to be solved.41 Shaikh Khalifah recently talked to me at consideraole length about the Bahrain water question, i do not know whether he had been instructed to do so by Shaikh Salman. He first of all stated that an unlimited-number of wells were being drilled at Q,atif and this was being encouraged by the Saudi Arabian Government. Mr. Anders on previously gave me similar information. ULr.Steine^e *s report shows that the drilling of wells at at if ma^ o.ffecL the water-level at Bahrain but i do not think we have suffi cient data to go on for making any kind of representa tion to His kajesty's Minister, Jedda. Shaikh Khalif^h also alleged that the large amount of water used by .bapco was affecting tne v.ater—level, cinci suggested that they should use sea-water for their machinery, i pointed out that the amount o- waier u^ec. by tiiem daily at Zellaq smounted to about of what was allowed to run to waste from the neighbouring 0 ardens. He then said that there were a large number of wells inside tue refinery at Sitra, and tnat as a result of the large amount of water used here the water- level in Sitra had fallen and some gardens 6n the refin ery side had dried up, the poor owners receiving no compensation, i was unable to argue about this as 1 did not know the facts. He also mentioned tr.at a well had been opened at Sitra idth such a large flow of water that the level of the main Sitra spring fell substantially and there was nearly a riot amongst the local inhabitants. This well had subsequently been closed. With regard to the suggested use of sea-water i said that i believed that it was much better for the / machineryOOijFiaSNTIAL 1064-3 / V The Residency, Bus hi re, 19 th October 1943. i ■51 0 Itear Wakefield, I see that the duestl on of wastage of artesian water has not moved very far siaoe I was last in the Criilf, and I should like to go into it arain on ray next visit to ^nhrain. There are one or two points ^htoh mi^ht he elucidated 'by then, I see a suggestion that it is necessary for the water to run to wa?te in r7 iellaq as otherwise It Fill harm the areas aoaoeraed. This st exas an arruuent that is difficult to sustain, unless it is heirv; run over the land with the specific j/urpose of betting rid of the salinity, Oould you look into this and find out what the position is? 3, I see a reference in the first paragraph of Oolonel Hay's note of 8th Septei her 194ii (of which a copy was sent to you under 'nesidency endorseuent No.'3/069 of the 8th Septemher 1943) to wells 'being drilled at -iatif.

The ?*e can be little aouot, ho^evei', that a big development of artesian wells at ^atif would seriously affect the water levels at Bahrain, and we should 'be fully within our rights in protesting. 4.

As regards the last paragraph, 1 aia puazled hy the reference to sea-water, unless it is used for coolinr purposes. I should hive thought that even for this purpose it would have been less satisfactory as there will be great corrosion in the pipes 'but would 'be nlad if you ciould lot ue know what the proposal is and whether ar ^/thing can he done in this line, 6. I have always 'been somewhat embarrassed in deal ing with this matter by the fact that the Agency were one of the principal wasters of water. If this is still the case perhaps you could see whether something ' cannot ho done to set it right.*41 r. ♦spelling uncertain * —... _- ^4 'W Colonel Prior's Confidential Demi-official Letter No.1064-3 dated 19th October , 42. \ r. . v i Para 2 ; Under the system of Irrigation generally followed In gardens In Bahrain two channels are dug on different 1 levels and these channels serve different purposes. The channel on the higher level, known as ^Sab' 1 ^ ± s the irrigation channel proper and carries water from the storage tank (which is fed \yy the tube^to all parts of the garden. The channel on the lower level, known as ♦ 'Manajjar', removes seepage I.e. carries away the brackish water which oozes out of the saturated soil. This water is highly saline and cannot be utilised again for irrigation. I understand that if these secondary drainage channels are not dug irrigated land soon becomes too saturated with salt to be productive. Water which flows into the sea from these seepage channels is not wasted as, when it flows into the sea, it has performed its function of irrigation and is carrying away deleterious salt. Wastage does occur, however, when gardeners fail to close the valve on the tube which feeds the tank when the tank is already full. When this happens water overflows from the tank and is drained away into the sea without being utilised. Para 3 : The information which I have secured about wells at Qatif is from Dr. Bramkamp, Head Geologist of CASOC. He informs me that only two drillers, employees of the Qosaibis and Kanoos respectively, are working in or near Qatif. One driller cannot complete a well in less than 5 or 6 weeks. The maximum rate at which wells are being drilled is therefore 4 per quarter. Dr. Bramkamp Informed me that in the coastal area ten miles south of Qatif to ten miles north of Qatif there are not more than 25 to 30 drilled wells. The volume of the good wells ranges from 5,000 barrels per day to 15,000 barrels per day assuming that the flow is continuous. (1 barrel » 42 gallons). Most of the wells have valves. &lt;— ¥ —Dr. Bramkamp said 'that in and round Qatif there had been as yet no reduction in the water level or in the pressure» He said thet the relation of the water supply in Saudi Arabia to the water supply in Bahrain had not as yet been fully determined but he gave it as his view that even if the number of wells in Oatif were increased i W; ■* a** ' 1 ^ ' I \ M ' v / five-fold Water supply in Bahrain would not be affected. In any case, long before water levels in Bahrain could be affected by Oatif withdrawals the water level in Qatif itself would fall substantially• Dr. Bramkamp believes that the catchment or feeder area of the water supply of Bahrain and Qatif is in the Dahina. He explained that the pressure of water was determined by the equilibrium or balance between feed and discharge. In consider ing discharge it is necessary to take into account submarine discharges as opposed to land withdrawals* He gave it as his opinion that submarine discharges, though not capable of exact determination, were land enormous and that the sum of^withdrawals was probably in comparison with the sum of submarine discharges. Dr. Bramkamp (who was, of course, consciously or unconsciously, arguing the Saudi Arabian case) said that reductions in water pressure or levels in Bahrain could only be due to local withdrawals in excess. Dug wells only penetrate the upper water zone. Drilled wells penetrate the lower water zone. Water from tne lower zone undoubtedly seeps through to the upper zone. It is likely therefore that wells drilled into the lower zone will reduce the water available for dug wells which draw their supplies from the upper zone•-—■■ , , 1 -3- Paras 4 A 6 ; There are 6 wells Inside the Heflnery at Sitra. The function of these wells Is two-fold - (a) to provide water for boilers and condensers In the Refinery and (b) for fire protection. For the second of these objects the wells are not, of course, normally used, but the water would be available In the event of emergency. For the first of these objects water from these wells Is absolutely necessary, r Sea water cannot possibly be used In boilers or condensers on account of corrosion, sediment- atlon and scaling. Any scheme to use sea water In place of well water In the Refinery Is entirely Impracticable. Para 6 : For several months I have personally ensured that water Is not wasted at the Agency. \ 3d. E. B.
