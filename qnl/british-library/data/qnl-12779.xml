He discusses the relinquishment of the British post on the island of Kishm [Qishm] and the return of the troops to India. In order to keep control over the 'pirate ports' there will be cruisers stationed along the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. MacLeod suggests that the naval force in the Gulf will be barely sufficient and requests that Taylor allow cruizers that have lately proceeded to Bussorah [Basrah] to be placed at the disposal of the Senior Officer Commanding as soon as possible. Finally, he informs Taylor of his intention to proceed to the 'Pirate coast' [the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf] where the cruizers are to be stationed and that he will probably not return to Bushire before 10 February 1823.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000023#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
