The main correspondents are as follows; the Agent to the Governor-General, Resident; the Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan; HM Ambassador to Iran and the Government of India, External Affairs Department. The aircraft is reported to have flown from Jiwani to Dashtiari by the RAF Commanding Officer at Jiwani. From here a Persian citizen and friend of the pilot, Mir Yusaf Khan Saddazai, was collected and transported back to Jiwani for a personal visit before returning with him a few days later. Also discussed is a Soviet press report suggesting that the trip had facilitated the delivery of arms to Baluchistan, a claim which is denied by the Government of India, External Affairs Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Dasht카훮r카</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military aircraft</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Agent to the Governor-General, Resident and Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>J카wani</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial rights</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aeroplanes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000193#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
