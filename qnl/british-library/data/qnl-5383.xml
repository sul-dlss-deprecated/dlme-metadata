My memo ran d^. No. 58, dated 10 th January regarding special repairs to Bundar Ahhas Consulate buildings. Assistant Engineer who is at Bundar Abbas reports that it is imperative that repairs be taken in hand at once to prevent more serious damage. Please telegraph approval.BY AIR MAIL. ft C Copy of a memorandum No. 58, dated e, the 10th January 1931, from the Hon*tie the Resident in the Persian Gulf, v i y 31 to the Foreign Secretary to the Govemment'^f India,New Dellii- I forward herewith two estimates for Special Repairs and Additions and Alterations to the Consulate building at Bandar Abbas amounting to Rs.2,802/- and Rs*^ 1722 respectively and request that the Government of India will be pleased to accord their administrative approval to them. I visited Bandar Abbas on the 23rd November and personally inspected the buildings. Large cracks have appeared in some of the walls, and it is obvious even to the layman that unless steps are taken to carry out the repairs without delay there is a serious risk of a portion of the building collapsing.Hi^ Majesty*s Consul has temporarily vacated his office for fear of this occurring. The additions and alterations involve the replacement of cement by Sind patent tiles and ruberoid. I understand that this will effect a considerable reduction of weight on the supporting walls and will also avoid the cracking to which cement is so liable. In these circumstances, I trust the Government of India will be pleased to sanction these additions and I would ask that their administrative approval both to the special repairs and to the additions may be conveyed by telegram. Funds to meet the cost of the work are available in the estimates for the current year. v Special Repairs to the Consu building at Bandar Abbas .
