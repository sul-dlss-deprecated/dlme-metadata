At our request Minister of State Cairo was asked to inform you in advance if Mission intended to visit Persian Gulf. Ambassador Baghdad in informing you of their movements was merely passing on general instructions laid down for their recep tion in Middle East. 2. I am glad to note from your telegram T/1295 that action requested in Baghdad telegram of December 6th has been taken. Following additional background may be useful. Origin of Mission is general concern which has been felt in United States of America regarding oil resources at their disposal and use that is being made of potential production in Middle East (see my telegram 26915 November 24th). U.S.A. opinion is extremely sensitive at present on this question and one of the objects of Mission Which is official will be to advise U.S.A. Government on whole question. Its report therefore is liable to have great influence on U.S.A. policy in Middle East where Americans have considerable oil interests and His Majestys Government regard it as important that all British representatives concerned should give the Mission a good reception in accordance with instructions in para graph No. 6 of Baghdad telegram 31. v» - RETAXANDUM - CONFIDENTIAL ♦ Brittsh Residency &amp; Consulate-General, No. 881-3 .

Following is text less 1st paragraph of note of State Department dated February 10th BEGINS: It is noted that while British Government agree that these conversations at outset should deal with problems of mutual interest regarding Middle East petroleum, they should at a later period be extended to cover general field of petroleum. This Government believes that it may be found desirable to extend scope of conversations beyond a discussion of problems of Middle East oil but that a determination of whether that should be done, and to what ex tent, can be made best in the light of progress of its d discussion of original Middle East oil. In compliance with British Governments desire for some indication of aspects of question which this Government believes should be discussed, there follows a tent ivelist of general topics which it is believed could be profitably covered in conversation. (1) Interests of producing and consuming countries in Middle East petroleum. (2) The quantity of Middle East oil that should flow into post war world markets. (3) Existing ? precedents to proposed production. (4) ) Transport problems. (5) Concession rights. (6) Price and marketing policies. It is contemplated that by it, group of no more that five staff members will conduct conversations for this Government the group will be headed by Petroleum Adviser State Department as chairman and will be carried on ? under directory of office of Eastern and African affairs of Department. It is believed to be auspicious for ? outcome of conversations that both governments desire to reach conclusions on basis of close co-operation. This Government strongly hopes that in this atmosphere the conversations can be initiated without delay. ENDS.

No comment This must depend on the general world petroleum situation and cannot be considered independently Owing to mutilation in the telegram I do not know what is meant. This presumably will raise the question of pipe lines and tanker transport. A discussion will be profitable I do not advise the discussion of concession rights as such. Though this subject will probably be touched upon when dealing with other subjects. If concession rights are discussed it should be made clear that what we have we hold. Cannot be treated individually but must form a part of world marketing policy. The United States representatives will undoubtedly approach conference with a definite plan and it is most desirable that we do the same.

WITH reference to Foreign Office minute of the 22nd September, 1938, concerning the Oil Agreement between the Standard Oil Company of California and the Saudi Arabian Government, published in Part 43 of Foreign Office publication “ Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs, July-December 1938,” I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the complete agreements as supplied to me confidentially by the Saudi Arabian Government. 2. The first agreement signed on the 29th May, 1933, as published in your minute, contains numerous inaccuracies and omits one article. In order to avoid a lengthy listing of these inaccuracies I have thought it better to send you copies of the complete agreement and the letter exchanged between the Saudi Minister of Finance and the representative of the Standard Oil Company of California, which forms an integral part of the first agreement. 3. With reference to the supplementary agreement signed at Riyadh on the 31st May, 1939, a copy of which was forwarded to you under cover of Mr. A. C. Trott’s despatch No. 123 of the 23rd July, 1939, and published on page 51 of Part 45 of Foreign Office publication “ Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs, July-December 1939,” only one inaccuracy occurs, and that in paragraph 2 of Part 2 of the agreement, where after the word “ bounded ” in the first line the following should be inserted : “ on the east, north, west and south by the following lines (a).' I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty s Minister of State at Cairo. I have, &amp;c. S. R. JORDAN. HIS BRITANNIO MAJESTY’S GOYERNMENT Enclosure. THIS agreement made between his Excellency, Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman A1 Hamdan, Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government (hereinafter referred to as the “ Government ”) of the one part, and L. N. Hamilton, acting on behalf of Standard Oil Company of California (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ Company ) of the other part. It is hereby agreed between the Government and the Company in manner following :— ^ Article 1. The Government hereby grants to the Company on the terms and conditions hereinafter mentioned, and with respect to the area defined below, the exclusive right, for a period of sixty years from the effective date hereof, to explore, prospect, drill for, extract, treat, manufacture, transport, deal with, carry away and export petroleum, asphalt, naphtha, natural greases, ozokerite and other hydrocarbons and the derivatives of all such products. It is understood, however, that such right does not include the exclusive right to sell crude or refined products within the area described below or within Saudi Arabia. Article 2. The area covered by the exclusive right referred to in article 1 hereof is all of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters) westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north 3(T west to the [49—48] R2 northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana such boundary shall continue in a straight line south 30 east to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia. For convenience this area may be referred to as the “ exclusive area. Article 3. In addition to the grant of the exclusive area described in article 2 of this agreement, the Government also hereby grants to the company a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations. This preference right includes such rights as the Government may now have, or may hereafter acquire, in the so-called Neutral Zone bordering on the Persian Gulf to the south of Kuwait. The nature of this preference right is to be hereafter agreed upon. The term “ oil concession ” as used in this article means an exclusive concession covering the same products which are covered by the present agreement. Furthermore, the Company’s geologists shall have the right to examine the region covered by the preference right just referred to (excepting the Neutral Zone referred to above), in so far as such examination may be necessary or advisable for a better understanding of the geological character of the exclusive area. Article 4. Within the time agreed in article 18 of this agreement the Company shall make an initial loan to the Government of £30.000 gold, or its equivalent. Article 5. The Company shall pay the Government annually the sum of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent. For convenience this payment is termed an annual rental, and it is payable in advance. The first annual rental shall be paid within the time agreed in article 18 of this agreement; thereafter, so long as the contract is not terminated, the annual rental shall be due upon each anniversary of the effective date hereof and shall be payable within thirty days after such anniversary, provided that upon the commercial discovery of oil no further annual rental shall be due or payable. Article 6. If this contract has not been terminated within eighteen months from the effective date hereof, the Company shall make a second loan to the Government amounting to £20.000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of such loan shall be eighteen months from the effective date hereof, but the Company shall have fifteen days from the due date within which to make the loan. Article 7. During the life of this agreement the Government shall be under no obliga tion to repay the initial loan of £30,000 gold (or its equivalent), or the second 0^ loan of £20,000 gold (or its equivalent). The Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these two loans by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. If the amount of the two loans, in whole or in part, shall not have been so recovered by the Company upon the termination of this contract, the Government shall repay the unrecovered amount in four equal and consecutive annual instalments, the first instalment to be paid within one year from the date of the termination of this agreement. Furthermore, until such unrecovered amount has been repaid by the Government, the Company’s preference right, referred to in article 3 hereof, shall continue in force. i r Article 8. Upon the effective date of this agreement the Company shall commence plans and preparations for geological work, so planning the work as to take advantage of the cooler season for more efficient work in the field, and of the hotter season for the necessary office work of compiling data and reports. In any event, the actual field work shall commence not later than the end of September 1933, and it shall be continued diligently until operations connected with drilling are commenced or until the contract is terminated. i *3 Article 9. Within ninety days after the commencement of drilling, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such portions of the exclusive area as the Company at that time may decide not to explore further, or to use otherwise in connexion with this enterprise. Similarly, from time to time during the life of this contract, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such further portions of the exclusive area as the Company may then decide not to explore or prospect further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. The portions so relinquished shall thereupon be released from the terms and conditions of this contract, excepting only that during the life of this contract the Company shall continue to enjoy the right to use the portions so relinquished for transportation and communication facilities, which, however, shall interfere as little as practicable with any other use to which the relinquished portions may he put. Article 10. The Company shall commence operations connected with drilling as soon as a suitable structure has been found, and in any event if the Company does not commence such operations within three years from the end of September 1933 (subject to the provisions of article 27 hereof), the Government may terminate this contract. Once commenced, these operations shall be continued diligently until oil in commercial quantities has been discovered, or until this agreement is terminated. If the Company should fail to declare so sooner, the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities shall be the date upon which the Company has completed and tested a well or wells capable of producing, in accordance with first-class oilfield practice, at least 2,000 tons of oil per day for a period of thirty consecutive days. Operations connected with drilling include the ordering and shipping of materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia, the construction of roads, camps, buildings, structures, communication facilities, &amp;c., and the installation and operation of the machinery, equipment and facilities for drilling wells. Article 11. Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall advance to the Government the sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent, and one year later the further sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of the first advance shall be the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, as provided in article 10 hereof, and the due date of the second advance shall be one year later. In each case the Company shall have sixty days following the due date within which to make the advance. Both of these advances are on account of royalties which may be due the Government and consequently the Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these advances by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. Article 12. Since it has been agreed that the annual rental of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent, is payable to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, ^ and since it has been agreed also that this annual rental is to be payable in advance, it may happen that the last annual rental paid pi 101 to the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities will cover a period beyond the date of such discovery. In case that this period should be equal to or greater than one-fifth of a year, the proportionate amount of the £5,000 pounds gold, or its equivalent, corresponding to such period shall be treated as an advance on account of royalties due the Government, and consequently it shall be recoverable by the Company by way of deductions from one-halt of the royalties due the Government. Article 13. As soon as practicable («\e., allowing a reasonable time for ordering and shipping further materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia and commencing further work) after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall continue operations connected with drilling by using at least two strings of tools. These operations shall be continued diligently until the proven area has been drilled up in accordance with first-class oilfield practice, or until the contract is terminated. [49—48] b 2/ s 4 Article 14. The Company shall pay the Government a royalty on all net crude oil produced and saved and run from field storage, after first deducting— (1) Water and foreign substances; and (2) Oil required for the customary operations of the Company’s installations within Saudi Arabia; and * (3) The oil required for manufacturing the amounts of gasoline and kerosene to be provided free each year to the Government in accordance with article 19 hereof. The rate of royalty per ton of such net crude oil shall be either— (a) Four shillings gold, or its equivalent; or (b) At the election of the Company at the time of making each royalty payment, 1 dollar, United States currency, plus the amount, if any, by which the average rate of exchange of 4 shillings gold, during the last half of the semester for which the royalty payment is due, may exceed 1 dollar and 10 cents. United States currency. Thus, for example, if such average rate should be 1 dollar and 14 cents, United States currency (that is to say, 5 dollars and 70 cents per gold pound), the royalty rate would be 1 dollar and 4 cents, United States currency, per ton of such net crude oil. Article 15. If the Company should produce, save and sell any natural gas, it will pay to the Government a royalty equal to one-eighth of the proceeds of the sale of such natural gas, it being understood, however, that the Company shall be under no obligation to produce, save, sell, or otherwise dispose of any natural gas. It is also understood that the Company is under no obligation to pay any royalty on such natural gas as it may use for the customary operations of its installations within Saudi Arabia. Article 16. The Government, through duly authorised representatives, may, during the usual hours of operations, inspect and examine the operations of the Company under this contract and may verify the amount of production. The Company shall measure in accordance with first-class oilfield practice the amount of oil produced and saved and run from field storage, and shall keep true and correct accounts thereof, and of any natural gas it may produce and save and sell, and duly authorised representatives of the Government shall also have access at all reasonable times to such accounts. The Company shall, within three months after the end of each semester, commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, deliver to the Government an abstract of such accounts for the semester, and a statement of the amount of royalties due the Government for the semester. These accounts and statements shall be treated as confidential by the Government, with the exception of such items therein as the Government may be required to publish for fiscal purposes. The royalties due the Government at the end of each semester, commencing 0^ with the date of commercial discovery of oil, shall be paid within three months after the end of the semester. In case of any question as to the amount of royalties due for any semester, such portion of the amount as may be unquestioned shall be tendered the Government within the period hereinabove provided, and thereupon the question shall be settled by agreement between the parties, or, failing that, by arbitration as provided in this contract. Any further sum which may be payable to the Government as a result of this settlement shall be paid within sixty days after the date of such settlement. Article 17. It is agreed that all gold payments provided in this contract, whether pounds gold or shillings gold, are to be based on the gold pound standard according to its weight and fineness at the time the payments may be due. It is also agreed that wherever it is stipulated in this contract that the equivalent of any sum or amount in pounds gold or in shillings gold may be paid, such equivalent may be dollars in United States currency, or pounds sterling. It is agreed, furthermore, that the equivalent of pounds gold or shillings gold, for any payment which may be made hereunder in dollars. United States / r *o \ 1 r - currency, or in pounds sterling (with the exception of the first payment provided for in article 18 hereof), shall he based on the average of the rate of exchange as computed over a period of three months immediately preceding the due date of the payment. Article 18. All payments provided in this contract to be made to the Government may be made by tendering such payments directly to the Government, or by depositing the amount due to the credit of the Government in some bank which the Govern ment designates in writing and which the Government may change from time to time by giving written notice to the Company long enough in advance so that the Company will have sufficient time to make future payments to the new bank. It is agreed that the Government will designate such hank in Saudi Arabia, or in the United States of America, or in England, or in Holland, but that no bank in Saudi Arabia will be so designated unless such bank has a correspondent in United States of America. England or Holland through which bank transfers . of money to Saudi Arabia may be made. Once the Company has made the proper payment to the Government, or has deposited the proper sum in any such bank, or has paid the sum to such correspondent for transfer to a bank in Saudi Arabia, the Company shall be free of all further responsibility in connexion with the payment. It is agreed, however, that the first payment of £35,000 gold, or its equivalent (comprising the initial loan and the first annual rental), shall be made, within fifteen days after the effective date of this agreement, to a correspondent, in New York or in London, of Netherlands Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij) at Jedda, Saudi Arabia, to be trans mitted without delay, and at the expense of the Company, to said society and to be delivered to the Government upon obtaining a proper receipt from the Govern ment for such payment. If this first payment is not made in gold, it will be made in pounds sterling at the current rate of exchange at the time the Company makes the payment to such correspondent. Article 19. As soon as practicable after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall select some point within Saudi Arabia for the erection of a plant for 'manufacturing sufficient gasoline and kerosene to meet the ordinary requirements of the Government, providing, of course, that the character of the crude oil found will permit of the manufacture of such products on a commercial basis by the use of ordinary refining methods, and provided, further, that the amount of oil developed is sufficient for the purpose. It is understood that the ordinary requirements of the Government shall not include resale inside or outside of the country. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary arrangements, and as soon as the Company has obtained the Govern ment’s consent to the proposed location, the Company shall proceed with the erection of such plant. During each year following the date of completion of this plant the Company shall offer free to the Government in bulk, 200,000 American gallons of gasoline and 100,000 American gallons of kerosene, it being • understood that the facilities provided bv the Government for accepting these deliveries shall not impede or endanger the Company’s operations. Article 20. The Company, at its own expense, will employ the necessary number of guards and guides to protect its representatives, its camps and installations. The Government promises to co-operate fully in supplying the best soldiers and men available for this responsibility, and in furnishing every reasonable protec tion, at rates not exceeding those customarily paid by the Government or others for similar services, it being understood that the expense for such services shall be paid by the Company through the Government. Article 21. In return for the obligations assumed by the Company under this contract, and for the payments required from the Company hereunder, the Company and enterprise shall be exempt from all direct and indirect taxes, imposts, charges, fees and duties (including, of course, import and export duties), it being under stood that this privilege shall not extend to the sale of products within the6 country, nor shall it extend to the personal requirements ol the individual employees of the Company. Any materials imported free of duty may not be sold within the country without first paving the corresponding import duty. ' r Article ' I ' l . It is understood, of course, that the Company has the right to use all means and facilities it may deem necessary or advisable in order to exercise the rights granted under this contract, so as to carry out the purposes of this enterprise, including, among other things the right to construct and use roads, camps, buildings, structures and all systems of communication; to install and operate machinery, equipment and facilities in connexion with the drilling of wells, or in connexion with the transportation, storage, treatment, manufacture, dealing with, or exportation of petroleum or its derivatives, or in connexion with the camps, buildings and quarters of the personnel of the Company; to construct and use storage reservoirs, tanks and receptacles; to construct and operate wharves, piers, sea-loading lines and all other terminal and port facilities; and to use all forms of transportation of personnel or equipment, and of petroleum and its derivatives.

HAMILTON, On behalf of Standard Oil Company of California. His Excellency, Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman A1 Hamdan, Jedda, Saudi Arabia. Dear Sheikh Abdulla, Jedda, Saudi Arabia, 'I'dth May, 1933 (corresponding to the Ath of Safar, 1352, A.Hi). Referring to the contract which has been signed to-day by you, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government, and by the undersigned, on behalf of Standard Oil Company of California, relative to an oil concession covering a portion of eastern Saudi Arabia, I am setting forth below the agreement we have also reached on behalf of the two parties to the same contract, which agreement shall be considered as a part of the said contract. For convenience, the two parties in question shall be referred to below in the same manner as designated in the said contract, namely, the “ Government and the “ Company, and the said contract shall be referred to as the “ Saudi Arab Concession.” 1. The Company is granted a preference right to an oil concession covering a certain area described in article 3 ot the Saudi Arab Concession. 1 he preference right so granted the Company shall be a right to acquire an oil concession covering such area, exclusive of the so-called neutral zone, also referred to in the same article 3, by equalling the terms of any offer for suc*h concession that may be made the Government by others in good faith, and that the Government may be ready and willing to accept. Within thirty days after receiving from the Government written notice, setting forth in full the terms of such offer, the Company shall notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession by equalling the terms so offered. If the ( ompany does not wish to do so, the Government is free to accept the offer made, but if an oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those so offered . ^(49—48] - . - - , €10 and so presented to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi' Arab Concession remain in force. 2. The Company’s preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the so-called neutral zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession shall be a right to equal, with respect to the rights of the Government in the neutral zone, the terms and conditions which may be obtained by the Sheikh of Kuwait for a concession covering his rights in the neutral zone. In the absence of any grant of an oil concession covering such rights of the Sheikh of Kuwait, the Government will endeavour to reach an agreement with the Sheikh of Kuwait whereby the company will be permitted to acquire an oil concession covering the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Kuwait in the neutral zone. In either of these two events, the company shall have a period of thirty days from the date it receives written notice setting forth in full the terms and conditions of the oil concession covering the rights of the Sheikh of Kuwait in the neutral zone, or covering the terms of the proposed concession embracing the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Kuwait in the neutral zone, as the case may be, within which to decade and to notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession on such terms. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to negotiate with others, but if the oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those offered to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 3. Article 22 of the Saudi Arab Concession states that the use of aeroplanes shall be the subject of a separate agreement. One purpose of the present letter is to set forth the agreement as to this point. In view of the restrictions now prevailing in Saudi Arabia as to the use of aeroplanes within the country by anyone other than the Government, it is hereby agreed that so long as such restrictions remain in force, the Government will undertake to provide, at the request and at the expense of the Company, such aeroplane service as the Company may consider advisable for the purpose of its operations within the area covered by the Saudi Arab Concession. Such service shall be limited to the purposes of the enterprise. If any aeroplane photographs should be taken- for geological or mapping purposes, the Government and the Company shall each receive copies, also at the expense of the Company. 4. The consent of the Government must be obtained before the Company shall have any right to examine the so-called neutral zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. 5. The provisions of article 33 of the Saudi Arab Concession shall also apply to this agreement. In order to confirm the above agreement, will you be kind enough to sitni below under the heading “ Agreement Confirmed.” ' I am sending this letter in triplicate, and upon the return of two copies signed by you, as well as the two signed copies of the Arabic text, they will be forwarded with the Saudi Arab Concession to the offices of the Company in San Francisco foi* ratification bv the Company there, after which one signed and ratified copy of the English' and Arabic text hereof will lie returned to the Government.

Lloyd Hamilton Director Bahrain Petroleum Company who arrived unexpectedly yesterday stated that he was here in connection with survey for proposed Trans- Arabian pipeline apparently on behalf of ARAMCO. He said that it had been decided to conduct aerial survey to ascertain possibilities and that Saudi section had already been mainly completed with the concurrence of Ibn Saud. He added that they were also searching for possible site for additional part on Hasa coast in addition to Ras Tanurah. He also said that he hoped to call shortly on High Commissioner Palestine regarding possibility of surveys there and mentioned Haifa as possible port for pipeline. Sinai and Transjordan have apparently been consulted. Lloyd Hamilton is interviewing Ibn Saud to-morrow at A1 *Charaj and expects to return by air to Cairo early next week. He expected that mission would then return to States but intended himself to remain in Cairo for the tine being.

ARABIAN OIL LINE TO BE BUILT DESPITE CLASH, EXPERTS SAY+ Admitting that the battle over international control of oil will come to a head immediately after the national election here, well-informed oil men still insisted today that, whether or not an agreement is reached, one thing sure to survive is the proposal to build a pipe line from fields in Saudi-Arabia controlled by the Texas Co. and Standard Oil of California. This line will be built and it will be built by private capital put up by the companies, the well-informed men declared. All that is dead, they added, is the famous proposal of Petroleum Administrator Ickes to have the American government build this line and keep it. This proposal, they continued, never has been widely understood. At best, they went on, it never was more than a bluff to force private interests to agree to the project, especially foreign interests. But it could not have been realized for two reasons. For one thing the line must pass through mandated territory and only the mandated government can build there. For another, the Petroleum Administration is slated to wind up on June 30, 1947, at which time it must have all its funds in liquid form, a fact that precludes it from sinking 150 millions in a project it will take several years to complete. Only the Texas Co. and Standard of California can do that and have an interest in doing so, oil men explained, for these companies own the oil to be piped. The difficulty they face is the objection of other American concerns. When the Texas and California companies drew their plans for the line and raised the money for it, they aroused opposition here because the pipes would lead to the Mediterranean, avoiding Suez Canal tolls, a fact that would enable these companies to undersell those shipping oil by tanker from America. The Arabian holdings of the two companies are among the richest in the world and tapping them has been restrained by agreements among foreign companies heavily entrenched in the Near East and Persia. But their objection to piping Cal-Tex oil to the sea and so to European markets have been lessened, if not done away with entirely, by pressure from the British government, which sees that feeling is rising in America over the extent to which American resources have been depleted by the calls of war (Received under India Office, London, endorsement No. Ext. 5231/44 dated 20th November 1944.)

There have since been the following further developments. 2. The President of the United States, shortly after the signature of the Agreement, decided to submit the text (but not the agreed statement) to the Senate for ratification as a Treaty. This procedure involves (a) reference to* the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, (b) a report back to the Senate by the Committee with appropriate recommendations and (c) a debate and vote on the Treaty by the Senate under the two-thirds majority rule. In November, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to delay until the meeting of the new Congress con sideration of all major Treaties pending, and it appeared that the Oi}. Agreement would, therefore, come before the Committee next month. 3. Meanwhile, however, Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Committee, issued a statement to the Press on December 2nd expressing the opinion that the Agreement would never be ratified by £xa« the Committee and that in his view the Agreement was not necessary for the general welfare and was unfair to the American Oil Industry. 4. In explanation of Press reports that the State Department were preparing a revised Agreement for sub mission to the United Kingdom Government, H.M.Ambassador, Washington, state-s that the Oil Policy Committee of the Petroleum Industry War Council ( a body representative only of the United States industry) have prepared a revision of the Agreement which was overwhelmingly approved by the Council and has now been formally sub mitted to the United States authorities. A large factor in the industry's opposition to the Agreement appears to be the feeling that the latter is an attempt on the part of the United States Administration to obtain control affcx of the domestic industry. 6. H.M.Ambassador states that the United States autho rities will now examine the revised document prepared by the United States Oil industry and will probably endeavour to strike a compromise between the present Agreement and this revision. While it is impossible to forecast pre cisely the future procedure, he thinks that the president may withdraw the existing Agreement from the Senate Committee and that, if and when a compromise document approved by the United States authorities is prepared, the President may take the decision to handle the matter henceforth by executive action. The position may become clearer in the next two or three weeks. 6. A copy is enclosed of telegram from Washington,No.6570 of the 9th December, giving the text of the letter from the Chairman of the Oil Policy Committee to the Petroleum Industry War Council, and of the revised Agreement as approved by that Council and submitted to the United States authorities.

Earl of Halifax No. 6570 9th December, 1944. Received 10th December,1944. IMMEDIATE . My immediately preceding telegram. following is text of (A) covering letter of December 5th from chairman of Oil Policy Committee to Petroleum Industry War Council. ( You will recollect that Oil Policy Committee is special committee of Petroleum Industry War Council formed to consider this and kindred matters on behalf of the P.I.W.C.) (B) agreement revised in accordance with proposals of P.I.W.C. and endorsed by that body as well as by the American Petroleum institute itself. 2) (A) To Petroleum Industry War Council. In response to the instructions received from the Petroleum Industry W a r Council, the National Oil Policy Committee has attempted to draft modifications of the Anglo-American oil agreement to meet the objections that have been raised- The Committee endeavoured to • carry on its deliberations within the framework established by the Council and by the Petroleum Administrator’s letter of October 24th 1944 to W.R. Boyd jr. chairman of Petroleum Industry 'War Council reading. 'I understand that the Petroleum Industry War Council and certain of its committess desire to register objection to the recently negotiated Anglo- American agreement. If the Council or any of its committees do so desire to record with me such views on the subject I request that at the same time as they make known their objections they likewise make known in specific language exactly how, in their view, the existing docu ment might be revised so as to remove the points of objection cited, this in the interest of the creative a nd helpful approach as opposed to a purely destructive one” pursuant to the request contained in hhe above letter the Petroleum Industry War Council at its meeting of October 25th, 1944 adopted the following resolution. Dr. Wilson moved that the National Oil Policy Committee be instructed to continue its study of Anglo- American oil agreement and make an effort to suggest to the Council at its next meeting revisions in specific language that existing objections to the document would be removed, that in doing so the committee give full consideration to the (grp. omitted) cited in the resolution presented as a minority report of the Committee as well as all other criticisms and objection which may come to the attention of the Committee during the course of the study.” It is important to keep in mind that the * Committee’s work was on an agreement which had been signed and submitted to the Benate £or ratification and that the Petroleum Industry War Council was requested to comment upon this agreement and to 2make known in specific language exactly how in their view the existing document might beVS - 2 - revised.' The Council was not requested to prepare an entirely new document, consequently the National Oil Policy Committee has laboured to draft modifications of this agreement to meet the numerous objections to it. It must also be recognised that the suggested agreement covers many and varied problems and that compromises were required. Many of the changes represent the unani- mouse opinion of the Committee, but in some instances they are the weight of the Committee's opinion. In reviewing the agreement the Committee had before it not only the objections raised in the resolution presented to the Council at its October meeting a copy of which is attached, but many other objections and criticisms which have been received from members of the Committee from members of the Petroleum Industry War Council and from the Industry. Careful consideration was given to all the points raised and the changes suggested were those thought necessary by the Committee to meet these objections. ’While the final results do not represent the preferred views of any individual, the Committee submits the enclosed suggested revision of the oil agreement with the recommendation that it is substituted for the original agreement. It must be recognised that as additional experience is gained, further changes and^ modifications may prove desirable. In submitting this revised agreement it is assumed that the submission of this report does not foreclose or impede expression of views by individual members of the Committee or by others and that the recommendations are not binding as future commitments on members of the Committee or ol the Petroleum Industry War Council nor will it operate to prevent any member of the National Oil Policy Committee or~the Petroleum Industry War Council fax* from ftaMng such individual or joint recommendations as they might desire by order of National Oil P’olicy Committee, A. Jacobson, chairman. 3. (B ) Preamble. The Government cf the United States of America^ and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Article 3. vVith a view to the wider acceptance of the policies embodied in this agreement the signatory governments agree that as soon as practicable they •'ill propose to the governments of other interested producing a nd consuming countries an Intertaional petroleum agreement which would establish a permanent International Petroleum Council composed of representatives of all parties to the agreement. To this end the signatory governments hereby under take to formulate plans for an International Conference to consider the negotiation of such an international petroleum agreement. They also undertake to consult with other interested governments with reference to the preparations for the proposed conference. Article 4. There are numerous problems of immediate interest to the signatory governments with respect to the International Petroleum Trade which should be discussed on a co-operative interim basis. With this end in view, the signatory governments hereby agree to establish an International Petroleum Commission, four members of which will be appointed^ immediately by each of the signatory governments.^ To enable the Commission to maintain close contact wit)' the operations of the Petroleum Industry, each government will provide for full and adequate consultation with its nationals engaged in the Domestic Petroleum Industry as well as with those engaged in the International Petroleum Trade.This Commission in furtherance of and in accordance with the policies embodied in this agreement shall consider problems of interest to the signatory governments and their nationals and shall be entrusted with the following duties and responsibilities with respect to the International Petroleum Trade. (1) to initiate studies of the problems of the International Petroleum Trade caused by dislocations resulting from War. (2) to initiate studies with respect to past and current trends in the International Petroleum Trade. (3) to initiate studies of the effects of changing technology in the Petroleum Industry upon the International Petroleum Trade. ^ (4) to prepare periodic estimates of the world demands for petroleum and of the various supplies which may be available for meeting the demands and to report concern ing means by which such demands and supplies may be correlated so as to further the efficient and orderly conduct of the International Petroelum Trade.

The Commission may regulate its own procedure and it shall establish such organisation as is necessary to carry out its functions under this agreement and the expenses of the Commission shall be shared equally by the signatory Governments. The signatory governments will endeavour to assist the Commission by making available to it such information as may be required for the efficient discharge of its duties and responsibilities. The signatory governments will, as appropriate, consult with and seek the collaboration of the governments of other producing and consuming countires in connection with the functioning of the Commission. Article 5. The signatory Governments agree. (1) unless the signatory governments decide otherwise in any particular case, all reports of the International Petroleum Commission' shall be promptly published by each government. Upon such publication by a government, any action taken in compliance therewith shall not be deemed an infringement# of its laws with reference to restraints • of trade. (2) no provision in this agreement shall be construed to require the nationals of a signatory government to comply with any report or suggestion made by the Commission whether or not it is published. Article 6. The signatory governments agree (l) no provision in this agreement shall be construed to apply to the operation of the Domestic Petroleum Industry within either country (2) no provision in this agreement sh£ll be construed to prevent a signatory government from taking such action as it may desire to limit the amount of petroleum which may be imported into its country.-5- Article 7.

Dear Baxter, We have received a telegram from the Department of state dated December 9th, requesting us to inform the Foreign Office that the Arabian American Oil Company is initiating negotiations with British officials in Jerusalem with a view to obtaining right for the Company to construct a pipe line across Trans-Jordania and Palestine, with refinery and terminal facilities in the latter country. The Embassy also has been instructed to inform the Foreign Office that although this is a company project the Department will render all appropriate assistance in connection with the aforementioned negotiations, and that it therefore wishes the Department's interest to be indicated to the appropriate officials of the British Government. Sincerely yours, (sga) w.j. Charles W. Baxter, CMG., MC., Foreign Office, S.W.l.Should oe available in international trade to nationals of all peaceable countries. They went on record in support of equal opportunity in the acquistion of future exploration and development rights. They pledged tnenselves mutually to res pect all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights'. Mr^ Ickes concluded by saying that the petroleum industry war council, composed of seventy-six representatives of oil companies, had gone over theAnglo-American agreement, 'aided by their lawyers and oy Judge Manly Hudson of the Permanent Court of International Justice', and that this body during six weeks of study had suggested changes. These, he added, were submitted back to the Governments on Wednesday, and it was now up to the Governments to accept, modify or' reject them. ' LB.&amp; Tra ns-Arabiaj Line Is Planned Bv 2 Oil Firms * California Standard and Texas Co. Prepared to I ap Saudi Arabia Supply By J. D. Tbmpkins Standard of California and Texas&lt;Co. are now fully pre- pared^frfffiance andAuild the Uans-arabian pipe tap vast petroleum resoniqiM which they have been ly developing in j Saudi Araj&amp;C, a top official of Texac^^vealed yesterday. The executive emphasized, how ever, that actual construction of 1 the line may be deferred for some time and described all moves up to the present as “preliminary.” The latest of these steps, it is disclosed, is the formation of a second Arabian corporation, Trans- Arabian Pipe Line Co., the present function of which is to hold rights of way obtained in connection with various tentative routes under con sideration for the pipe line project. Trans-Arabian Pipe, jointly owned ' by Standard and Texaco, would construct and operate the line, when conditions and circumstances warrant. Routes Proposed Arabian American Oil Co., the company formed by Texaco and Califorhia Standard to hold con- cessioAs and develop oil deposits in S^udi Arabia, completed the plans for the pipe line along the Persian Gulf region from the pro ducing areas to the Mediterranean. In all, it is disclosed, Arabian- . American technicians Jiave pre pared plans and obtaineci rights of way for seven proposed routes which were surveyed during 1944 and 1945. Two of the routes would be to marine terminals at Tripoli or Beyrouth, capital of Lebanon. Other possible terminals are at Haifa, Jaffa, El Arish, Port Said and Alexandria. • Tentative plans call for the con struction of a‘ twenty-four or twenty-six inch line, completion of which would obviate payment of Suez Canal tolls on the Saudi Arabian production. Various esti mates have indicated that as much as one-third of the world’s known petroleum resources are located in the Persian Gulf region. Ready to Use Own Funds Under original plans for a trans- Arabian pipe line, the United States government, through Pe troleum Reserves Corp., would have had an interest in the undertak ing. Government funds, estimated at about $100,000,000, would have been made available for its con struction, with the companies re paying the advance with interest over a period of years. Texaco and Standard, however, are understood to have been prepared from the first to go ahead with the project, using their own funds wheJi and if the plan appeared feasible and profitable. Their investment in the Saudi Arabian concessions to date is between $90,000,000 and $100,- 000 . 000 . Elimii^ting the Suez tolls, it is calculated, oil can be brought by tanker from the eastern Mediter ranean to American and Canadian Atlantic ports at a lower cost than oil, at present prices, from Carib bean sources. Terminal facilities at Lebanon would involve arrangements with France because of her mandate over the Levant. Only recently Washington reported that the United States had made inquiries regarding free port rights in Trip oli and Beyrouth. \■&gt; N if- S ”7 1 f. P.I.C.

During the past decade, the kiddle Pat-1 has emerged as poten tially the world* s greatest oil reservoir. Vast new deposits have oeen discovered in the area, is a result of which Middle East oil reserves are now estimated to represent .30 &gt;j oi the total known oil reserves of the world. This is only exceeded oy North America, 'v ith MO/d oi tne known oil reserves of the world. But whereas, in North America the oil _ ields aro being worked to capacity, in the Middle East only a very small proportion of the avail able oil supply is as yet being tapped. In 1141, North American production of cruue oil was 1,750 million barrels whilst that of the Middle East was only 134 million barrels. '7 barrels = approx 1 ton). At this rate, U.S. known reserves woulu be sui'ficient for onC' 12 years; .whereas Middle East supplies would suffice for 100 years. A very few years under these conditions would coj.ipletely change the world oil supply situation; in ten years. North American oil supplies would be approaching exhaustion, whereas Middle East oilfields would represent nearly 60^o- of the total world reserves of crude oil, (14,000 million barrels against 11,000 million barrels for the rest of the world). 2. The above facts were brought to light by an official oil canmission which reported to the American Congress in 1945. A summary of the commission's findings with regard to the statistical position of the world oil production and reaei’ve in 1944 is given below. Mead report, as it became to be known, focussed attention on the dwindling reserves of Anerica and the importance of Middle East resources. fforld Oil Production and Reserves I9t4.

The above figures axe based on the oil situation uc. it was in 1344 &amp;nu the position is of course liable to some modification. It is, for example, -..ore ioan probable that further new oilfields will be discovered in the next feu years. Active prospecting is in progress throughout the world. But in view of the amount 01 prospect ing already carried cut in North America, there is less probability ox big new discover ies ^ere than in less known areas such as mi- --i-aie East rji U. b. b. A. 4. New discoveries together with uevaloj ent oi' synthetic production help the U.S.A. to meet her essential requirements for home consumption lor a long time to come, but it is extremely unlikely that they v/ill allow her to maintain her position G the world's greatest oil supplying area. Already u.b. strategists have raised a cry 01 alarm that U.S. oil supplies are insufficient fox another oil war. The policy of re striction of o,il exports with a view to conservation of home supply has already oeen adopted in principle in American official quarters. It is possible that before long the United States will cease to be an oil exporting area and later still It may even become an oil importing country. 3 . Its place, as far as'U.K., Europe, the Mediterranean, the middle East, Africa and. the Indian Ocean is concerned, will be laig ely^ taken by the middle mast. ^ consider able quantities of Iraq and Persian oil were shipped to Europe even jexore the war. This 'process is obviously going to expand in view of the increase in production and projected pipeline developments to the Mediterranean basin. -- laco, ic Uipears probable that during the next few years the Middle East will, to a. Iar 0 e extent, sup plant the- U.S. as the world's principal oil exporting area. -'/The importance6 , The ifiiportance of this ’from a strategic point of vipw cannot be over emphasised, Adequate oil supplies arvj essential to modern warfare, 4 iVen ii. io is orue, as is sometimes claimed, that atomic energy is destined to become the pov/s-r oi the future, it will be many years before it can be universally applied, and the problem of controlling atomic energy for use in smaller power plants ma*/ well oe insoluole, a^ven if, in the next few years, atofiiic energy is renuered practicable for large power pianos, the day when it can replace the petrol—drawn internal combustion engine in vehicles and aircraft is still a long way off# In one meantime, petrols... will acquire increasing importance as world stocks diminish, 7* Apart from its importance ^as a potential world supply centre, middle huso oil is of particular strategic value to the British iimpire because of its geographical location. Placed at the junction of Europe ana the Far East, at the main cross-roads between England, India, Australia and South Africa, the luiudle East nominates strategic Empire communications. The nearest alternative sources of oil supply are i^merica to the West, and Burma and Borneo to the East, It is true that to the Nortn, .tne oil- • fields of Roumania and of Russia are nearer as the crow fliep, but evetj in times oi peace, little oil is available from those sources, all available exports •being., tahei'^y the nearer European market, while in time of war, as we have seen in t».e past two Great Wars, supplies from the north arc likely to be entirely cut off,’ Thu experience of tne last two wars has also shown the difficulty, and the danger, of-moving' larg.e supplies rf cil by tanker across thousands ©f miles of ocean^ liable at any moment to attack-by sea or air. Already in these two wars, the relatively small quantities of oil.available from Ibc&amp;l production in the Middle East have helped to tip tSie scales in this area from defeat to victory. Should Middle East supplies be destroyed, or should they tall into enemy hands, it might well prove impossible for us to defend this vital area, ^uid in a few years tune, when the expected expansion of Middle East oil production has taken place, possession of those oil supplies may well prove to be the aociaing factor not only in the defence of the kiddle' East but in the prosecution of the war as a whole. 8 , In these circumstances, Britain’s predominant position in the kiudle East petroleum world assumes great significance. At a rough estimate, Britain controls 70 - 75;l of present Middle East production and about 60£o of Middle East estimaceu reserves. The-Abadan, Haifa and Suez refineries are likewise British controlled. In marketing, British companies are predominant iri practically every iiiudle Eastern coun try with the exception of Levant States, Cyprus, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, % Financially too,, Britain’s share in Middle East oil is of immense importance today, British controlled oil installations in the Miudle East represent British c capital investments running into hundreds of millions of pounds. Tikg provide a source from which British and Empire requirements can be supplied .sth Sterling oil as opposed to Dollar oil which has hitherto had to meet the bulk of cne Empire’s oil requirements, and, in addition, a source of hard currency for Britain for oil exporteu to other tnan Sterling coun cries, 10, One other point may well be stressed, Tnroughout tne middle East there is an important nucleus of British Staff engaged in petroleum exploration, exploitation, transportation, refining and marketing. The value o± 1 this, n£&gt;t only in providing employment for a large number of British technical ana administrative c...plOj c-es over seas, but also in ensuring the fullest co-operation ,.itu the Services cannot be over emphasised, To take the single case #f the Shell Co. in Egypt; the presence ot ^ nucleus of British Staff enabled the Shell Co, immediately on the outbreak oi war wO take upon itself duties in connection with the supply not only of civilian requirements but also rf the Services' wartime needs, including both supplies and scorage toeixioies and even the provision rf containers in vast numbers. The organisation bi theBritisn oil companies throughout the area was s.acn that the Services and H.M.G. could use them virtually as a British Government,Department. This was only possible by virtue of the fact that the key men of the oil companies' staffs were British. Today the oil companies in practically all Middle East countries are faced with an increasing spirit cf nationalism, oxie of the objects of which is to replace all the Britisn Staff by local nationals. Should this policy be pushed too far, it might prove an embarrassment, to Britain and her allies in the event of again being involved in war in this area. 11. After bhe British, the most important oil interests in the Middle East are ^ now those of the Americans* v During recent years American oil companies, laced with the prospect of decreasing supplies, at home, have turned wich increasing urgency t# Middle East and have been most active in search of concessions ana in exploration. Their greatest successes to date have been in Saudi Arabia, Bahrein un&gt;-i AUwuio, In i^rexoia. particularly, American interests ar&lt;j rapidly extending. /Cther countries3 © 12, Other countries v;ith a financial staxe m x.iiuulc i!iast oix a-re tno iranch, *.iio have a share in the Iraq Petroleum Company ana tne pipeline to fripoli, and thw Ouocu, (Royal Dutch in conjunction with the Shell Company), Finally tne 'Russiiins, thou^u ao present they hold neither concessions nor oil installations in tne middle Fast, claim the sole right to oil concessions over the whole of Northern Persia anu are -.ost actively engaged in pressing their claims on unwilling Persia. * Middle East Produc tion ai jo Resources, 13 , Oil is at present produced in the following xiiddlo Fast counories: Persia, Irai, Saudi Arabia, Bahrein, F^-ypt, Kuwai.t ana che Qatar Peninsula, 14, Production in 1944 and estimated reserves of l:uown fields at cno onu of 19^-4^ are summarised in the following table.

Payments from the Oil Co...pany to t.m pc.si^n G t /royruyant ouo -'——■'I - 4 - represent one of the Most important sources of Government revenue. 17 .The main centre of production is in the souoh, in the area north and -west of the head of the Persian Gulf. At the’ present time five oilfields are in production in this ^crea; Masjid-i-Sulaiman and Haft Kel being -die oldest, and three # new fields, Agha Jari, Gach Saran and Pazanum, vMch were all brought into production during ihe war. All these oilfields are connected by pipeline to the oil refinery and port at Abadan. 18. In 1942 all surplus wells in Persia uere plugged as part of a denial scheme, only sufficient wells being retained to enable the Ifesgid-i-Suloiman and Haft Kel fields to operate at maximum economic capacity. With the removal of the threat, wells and fields have re-opened and production extended. (S'oop press: Production in 1945 'was 17 , 000,000 tons). 19 . The refinery at Abadan is one of the four-biggest in the world, and the biggest east of Sues. It played a vital part in the Allied war effort, supplying oil both to the Middle East and -go India and oho Far East. After the loss of the Far Eastern oil supplies in 1942 it became apparent that the refinery, big as it was, would be insuffic ient mo meet all demands, and large-scale expansion was undertaken. By December 1944 additional annual refinery capacity of 4,000,000 tons had been added, bringing up the to cal capacity to some 15,000*,000 tons per annum. This has since been still. further increased and at present approaches 20,000,00$ tons per annum. In the meantime new processes have been added an' in particular the production of high-octane aviation petrol has been enor ously increased. At the outbreak of hostilities there wore no facilities at Abadan for the manufacture of 100-octane aviation petrol. Today Abadan is equipped uo produce upwards of 1,250,000 tons a year. ~ 20. Virtually the whole of the output- of the Abadan refinery is exported. In addition to supplying ‘military and civilian requirements in the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, in Ease and South Africa and in India, Abadan during the war has provided vast quantities for the Middle East and Sou ah East Asia rheatres of war and even further afield. It is now available for U.K. end British Empire requirements. 21. The A.I.O.C. concession also covers a much smaller oilfield in western Persia at Naft-i-Shah. Oil from this field goes by'-pipeline to a small refinery at Ke man shah v/here it is refined, products being sold for local'consumption in Persia itself. 22. The A. 1.0.C. also has. interests in I rag through its share in the Iraq Petro leum Go., in the Haifa refinery, and in the nbwly developed centre of oil production at Kuwait* . • . 23. Although the British-owned A.I.O.C. concession is the only oil concession at present operative in Persia, many other countries nave autempeed go gain a j. 00 wing there in the past and there is every likelihood of further attempts in the future. American, Russian, Dutch, French and even Japanese combines have .all atte mpted, r.t varv.ous tunes, to obtain concessions. ‘ ■ &gt; 24. A Dutch mining group, the Algomeene Exploratio ^iij owns arr exploratory licenoo miner sis covering part of northern Iran, granted in 1939 and goving ^nem oal search and exploration rights” as well as the right go search for other minerals, buc l-V* ule or no exploration has been carried out under b is ?_icence. ^ / o 20 . The main Strug ,1c for concessions in the remainder of the country nas oeen between British, Russians and Americans &lt;anc goes back to the 1920's. The enormous strategic and economic importance of petroleum was first realised during the Great war, 1914-18, and immediately after the War there was a rush to acquire petroleum echoes Ions in various parts of the world. In Northern Persia, American, British and Russian, interests were in competition. In 1981, the Standard Oil Company ot A i^rica prop, sed an oil concession in the Northern Provinces an exchange for a loan, ot oen million dollars. The Anglo-Persian Oil Compftny then claimed tliat obey already 1 held a concession for Persian Government that Moscow would oppose any concession to foreigners for xne ex ploitation of oil in Northern Pc-.-rsia. SGiclusi^/e rights of. exploitation, he^ cxairied, had belonged to a Russian subject. (The Russian subject in question,^one Khochoxara, u. native of Georgia, has acquired somewhat doubtful concessions dated 1096 and 1916; these were che rights which the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. claimed to lifive 'purcimsed^from by the sareo individual. ,, 26. Since thaG time, the Russians have, consistently adnered to one cl ram uha^ they, and only they, have rights of oil exploitation in Northern Per sir.. Their policy /found expressionfound expression in the ”P^avcla' , on 26 Sept 1922 ^ .ollows: 'Vhu Hass^ Ckiyerient cculd no-ver tolerate the establishment on the Husso-Perslcu]'- iron-tier oi a iorei n capi- talist undertaking, which could, at any tine, transform its concession into a.s.ilitary base which would be a menace to Russia”. 27. The Anglh-vjncrican proposal fell uhrouji. The folio /in, ye..r (iffy) aaiodier ijnerican Oil Corporation, the Sinclair Consoliuated Oil Corporation, asked for a con cession for the northern area, and attempted to come to a workiu, a^oeioont .;ich the Russians lor the transport of oil across Russia! territory, but the Russkns proved intractable and the concession was never taken up. 28, having thus ioiled ajnglo-^i .erican attempts to obtain concessions, ii) Northern Persia the, Russians now made a bid to establish themselves in ths area. In 1925 a Ra,ao-Porsian oil company, the Kevir Khourian Co., Registered in Persia as a Persian Co., maiwly financed by the Russian Government, established to exploit an old oil c -cession in the Semnan area, (originally gran^d in 18?8 to Persian' subjects and re registered in 192k by their descendants who sold 75&gt;o of their rights to the Russian, Khichtiara). The company carried out a number of sounaings in various places in N.E, Pei oia buo i.ailed to strike oil* The Persian (Jovernment subset uently ciai-.ed that the concession was null and void as it had never been ratified. In 1ay6, the Persian Government granted exploration rights in this area to the Amiranian Oil Company, an idnerican-Pursian company, but the concession was abandoned in 19&gt;8. In Ifglj, Royal Dutch Shell ana the Standard Vacuum Groups entered into negotiation ./iob. the Persian Government for concessions in the South-east of Persia. Once a c ain the Ru mnians arrxved on che scone. In September 1944, i&gt;4 Kavtaradze, Soviet assistant Com.nissar.for foreign ^dTairs, arrived in Tehran with a committee of oil experts, ostensibly to raise the matter of the Khourian oil concession. However, after the first meeting i.ith the Persian Prime min ister (Saeu), the Khourian question was never a^ain menoion^d. Instead, Kavtaradze demanded a new concession giving the Soviet Go ver nmen c ex lox’atoip ri iits over an area ff 210,000 square miles in Northern Persia, from ^.ferbmijan co v^uchan, x’or a period of 5 years, after which they (the Russians; would specify the arJEs to exploit. I he Persians, not unnaturally, res j.s ceu ttiis demand. Kavtaradsd brought very strong pressure to bear. Doubtless he felt that he hau vv ood car^o in hie hands'. The ' international prestige rf Russia stood very hiji, and Russian troops were’m occ upa-.iqn in Northern Iran. Saed however held firm. Russiafi-en^ineereu uemons orations in Tehran and elsewhere, usin.g the Tudeh Party, only served co strengthen- ,.im resistance of c e majority of the Persians. British support and publicity helpeu co oR’eu^Hiu tuv Ifrslan resistance, and they now decided that no oil conc essions woui- be c r,,n Cud till after cue withdrawal of foreign troops which was due to ts he ‘place situ in 6 ^ont.:s of end f tee v/ar, Ravtaradze maae no effort to dis._nse his an &gt; : .f» In an efi’orc to :oeauo the Russians, Saed resigned, and. was replaced by Bay at.

' rcsoiuxioh'd''^'uehtm ■'tiirou h a 3111 of double urgency which forbade any Persian Prime minister, kin is ter, or Urm.er Secretary irom entering into any negotiation or signing any agreement with regard to oil concessions on gain cf imprisonment. Kavtaradze’s fury knew no bounds. A .-oe:: lattr he left, for MoscT^J not before stating that he expected the iiajlis to rectify its iiistajce. 29. The veto applied equally of course to British and Americans end negotiations for concessiors in the Gouch-east by both groups were suspended, 30. Events during the past few months- snow that despite their failure to obtain official permission the Russians have by no means renounced their aims in Northern Persia. Russian support to the Democratic Party’s programme of autonomy'for Azerbaijan is doubt less designed to w ive them a predominating influence in that area, Ann reports have already been received that the Russians are carrying out exploratory borxng for oil in the Tabriz area. Russian troops are still in occupation of the oiuvr prov-uices of Northern Iran (Gilan, Mazanderan and Gurgan) and. fexports indicate in ihcse areas too boring for oil is being carried out at a number of places, particularly m die Gur LJ an area.. 1 rac, « 31. long ago as 1901, W.K.

These were settled by the San Remo Agreement, under which bhc sequestrated 25 per cent interest of the Deutsche Bank was transferred oo a -combination of French oil interests, under the title 'Compagnie Francaise dcs Potroles”. 33* The S' n Remo Agreement was then bu'. terly at l; eked- in A' 1 erica as controjry to the 'Open Door' principle.

At present the only limiting factor to die a aunt that can be produced is the question o:. transport. To move who oil to the sea coast, the firs'; stage of its journey to bhe world’s markets, the crude oil is sent by pipeline, a distance of over 300 rales to die Mediterranean coash, m d^uble pipeline runs from Kirkuk, both pipes running parallel to Had:'tha one then /running west • • • • • —. ■ Vtm r running west to Tripoli in the Lebanon, while che other runs, south-west along age-cld caravan routes, through Transjordan to Haifa,, in Palestine, The northern (Tripoli) pipe line serves French ana &gt;uiierican interests, the southern (Haifa) piepline is us^d. by the British and Anglo-Dutch. The present combined pipeline capacity is 4,000,000 tons .per annum (2,000,000 tons per annum by each pipeline,) but additional and larger pipelines are under consideration which will bring’up the total capacity to 12,000,000 tons per annum in the course of the-next few years, ^•2, Before the war, the whole *f the crude oil was chipped a*.&lt;g -‘-rom Haifa and Tripoli in tankers to be refined abroad in France, Italy, U, , Bn^lond, etc. In 1939 however, a refinery was uiider construction at Haifa. (Cons.oliaated Hef.uicries Ltd., controlled by A. 1.0. C, and Koyal Dutch-Shell) • On the outbreak ox e,,r, oonstruction was expedited and the refinery started to operate in 1939, with c , capacity of 2,000,000 tons per annum, equivalent that is to the pipeline capacity to Haifa. . 43. On the collapse of France in 1940, the northern (Tripo li) j.X0CXOb tiO. from the Kirkuk cad and was not re-opened until the Allied troops ‘ re-occupied Syria in 1942,. Even then, as the Mediterranean remained closed, it was impossible oo carry away thg^prude oil for refining. To meet Mils situation, the refinery cup&amp;oifcy at Haifa was expanded until, by 1944, it was able to deal with the full OMrougHjUt. ox' 2 ,0o0,0oo tons per annum from both pipelines, the cruue oil bein^ carriea by cankers x rom Tripoli to Haifa. The til production from this refinery proved invaluable to the Imperial forces in the Middle East area during the war. Fortunacely in s^ite of a number of air attacks by the Italians little damage was done and the rex inery was never put ouc ox' operation. It is intended to expand still further the capacity Ox this refiner,, to meet thu input of oil from a new pipeline already under construction co Haifa. 44* 13;'is .also ihtrsndodj- to construct a lar^e refiner^ at Tripoli. During, the war the French constructed a small tapping plant cuere with impi-ovised res xurces to provide petrol and fuel oil for local requirements. In Hovomber 1943, ttie Ai-'icncan Group of tue I.P. C. obtained permission from the Lebanese Govorii.-.ent co erect r. rex'inerp t rc Tripoli. Eventually it is intended that refinery capacity at Tripoli and Haifa shall be sufficient t&amp; deal with the full quantity of 12,000,000 tons per annum co be ox.ou he in by pipeline. 45* During the war a muxibej? ff the wells. in Iraq were plugged as part of the H’iudla Eastern Denial, Scheme. At one cime only five-wells were in production m the Kirkulc area, but these were easily able to produce all the oil that could be :ovod by the single pipeline then in use. The richness of the field may be gachered from the fact that only fifty wells, including test wells, have beun drilled in the Kirkuk area, as compared with the thousands of wells of many American arid Russian oilfields. 46 , In the concession in N..YT. Iraq, large reserves of a heavy and sulphorfus oil have been found at Qaiyarah, but the quality is not such as to justify commercial production. The war has prevented further exploration in this area but prospects are believed to be good. 47* Basrah concession was ohly granted shortly before: xhe .arr, and there ha$ been no opportunity to carry out proper exploratory surveys.'

The Khanaouin Oil Company's concession in Eastern Iraq indues a small oil field at Naft Khaneh, just opposite the Naft-i-Shah oilfield in Persia, v/ian which in fact ^ forms a single field. The output from the baft Kh, a eh x'i u .e -. 0,. fOo - 250,GbO tons per annum, is piped under natural pressure to a s.-all re., inery at xtlwahd, five miles away.

Egypt has never ranked high in cho list of the '.orl^'s oil-prov-oacin^. countries Yet in two major wars she has been able to-play a crucially ixtportant part as a source ^f Allied oil supplies. By a strange coincidence, in both wars Eg, pt was fortunate enough toenough to discover new sources of oil, as a result of -which increased quantities of petroleum products were produced at the most critical moment, in an area in which these increased supplies were of vital importance. 52. The oilfields at present in production in E^ypt are controlled by Amlo- Egyptian Oilfields, Ltd., managed by the Shell Group, the controlling interests being held by Shell and the Anglo-Iranian (British). The Egyptian Government holds £100,000 ’’G' Shares in the Company and other shares are held by the public. 5^* Production da^es back to 1911, when oil was struck at Gemsah, on the western shore of the Red Sea, some 150 miles south of Suez. The walls here here yielded only a small production but in 1914 the Hurghada oilfield was discovered. This was rapidly developed during the. 1914-19 war, yielding in 191 S a,peak of 1 , 935*000 barrels, an excessive rate of production for this field, which literally, ’’wore itself out in the service of the Allies'. 54. After the war, production from Hurgha&amp;a field continued on a reduced rate and with a tendency to fall. In 1932 however, a new and bigger oilfield, was discovered at Ras Gharib, some 120 miles south of Suez, and by September 1939 production from this field had risen to 15*000 barrels per day. Since 193$*almost the whole of the production has been obtained from Ras Gharib, Hurghada being practically exhausted. 55 . The new discovery, caning as it did just before the opening of a second Wory^ War, was of great value to the Allied cause. The transport of petrol from Abadan, oyer 3*000 miles away, or from America round South Africa, became almost, prohibitive in 1940- 42 when Allied tanker losses assumed unprecedented proportions. Only the presence of considerable supplies on the spot helped to ease what would otherwise have been an in tolerable strain. Ras Gharib production rose to over 9.000.000 barrels (1,250,000 tons) per annum. 56. The rapid increase in production from the Ras Gharib field called for a corresponding increase in refinery facilities at Suez to cope with the unexpectedly high level of production. The outbreak, of war made it impossible to embark on a normal programme of refinery expansion and development, but by ingenious adjustments and more rapid throughput, it-was found possible *bo cope with the full production of drude .oili. 57* In view/ of the importance to the Allied war effort it is indeed amazing tha*c the enemy did not carry out more determined air attacks against the refinery and oil fields. Emergency measures were taken to meet such an ^even uality, buu fortunately, except, for the sinking of a tanker in the later part of 1942 at Ras Gharib, whereby bhe submarine loading line was temporarily put but of accion, the Egyptian oilfields and refineries suffered no important damage from enemy air raids. 58 . Throughout the war the oilfields and refinery wore worked to maximum capacity. New fields are urgently needed to maintain Egyptian output; az izs ourrenz level aftd exploration work is in progress in many afeas. The Anglo-Sgyptian Oilfields Co. hold a number of exploratory concessions. In addition, explora'-x&gt;ry licences have oeen taxen up,by a number of American Groups, including the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, v bocony Vacuum,, the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Oil Company. The areas involved include the Red Sea Littoral, the Sinai Peninsula, areas west of the Nile and_ al&lt;t&gt;ng jfthe Mediterranean coast. Geologically .there are several interesting possibil.LU.ies but these still remain to be proved. (As this report goes to-press it is reported that tbfe Anglo -Egyptian Oilfields Co. have struck oil in Sinai, opposite Suez). Arabian Peninsula an d Persian Gulf. '59. This is the most recent area to be developed and is noteworthy for the e..jenz to which American oil intexeszs have taken a leading part in recent developments, having struck several extremely rich oil deposits, particularly along zhe eastern coast of Arabia near the Persian Gulf * , 60. The Bahrein Petroleum Company, which holds a concession pver the Bahrein Islands, is technically a'Bri tish (Canadian) company, but is 7 ,holly American owned and forms a unit the Calzex Group (Standard Oil of California and Texas Corporation). The Company first esbabii ed itself in Bahrein.in 1930 by purchasing from a British syndicate a concession dating from 1925. In 1932, the new company struck oil and two years later comaeroial production began, a refinery having been built in the meantime. In 1934 the original concession area of 100,000 acres was -extended and again in 1940 until it now includes the 'hole of the Sheikh’s present and future dominions including the reefs and territorial waters surrounding the island. Output from the field, averages about 1,000,000 tons per annum’(1,1 35,000 tons in 1933) . The refinery capacity of about 1 500,000 tons per annum was increased in 1944 to 2 ,/ 50,000 tons per annum, uo deao. with crude oil from Bhahran, on the mainland. The refinery car now produce all /typos of • « • # • r • •1 - 9 - Sr types of petroleu products, including 100 -octane aviation petrel, 61. Encouraged by their discovery of oil ac Bahrein, the' Galifomian^Arabian Co. acquired a much more important concession in Saudi Arabia, an ar^-. of some 250,000 square miles (see map) covering the whole of the eastern area, of the Arabian Peninsula, except the coastal districts eastwards and southwards from the‘Qatar Peninsula, which are already covered by concessions granted at various times to affiliates of die I.P.C. 62. Oil was first discovered in Saudi.Arabia, in commercial quantities in 1957&gt; the area Kxng the Dhahran (or Da man Dome) field on the mainland, some $0 miles inLind and about dies norch of Bahrein. In 194'.,. tl&gt;p Caltex G-roup formed the Arabian American Company to control production in the area. Production from fuo Dhahran field amounted to or .y 67 ,.000 tons in 1934, but by 19'44 had risen to 600,000 tons. In the meantime, two further discoveries had’been, ade, one at Abquaia and the pther at Abu Hadiya, bringing up combined production in 1 944 to 1 , 550,000 tons. 63 . ^ At present the whole of the*Dhahran crude oil is refined in the Bahrein refinery. However, a new modem refinery is nearing completion at R&amp;s Tanura, on the' coa^t opposite lire in, with a capacity of 2 , 500,000 tons peif annum and capable of prcubing all types of products including 10.0-octane aviation petrol. With the completion of this refinery it is expected that production .from Saudi Arabia will be more than doubled in the very near future. Potential production is said 00 be at least 6 million tons per year. of. There are surface indications of the•existence of petroleum at tfany other places in the California-*Arabian 0il # Company 1 s enormous concession area and ttm- region holds rich promise of future discoveries. 65 . In the Qatar Peninsula oil has been discovered in the Dukhan area by the Iraq Petroleum Company, but production was suspended owing to the war. It is -.expected however, that work may shortly be resumed in this area. , 66 . In Kuwait, oil has been discovered in the Burgan Hills region. Oil prospecting and exploration rights covering the whole of Kuwait, (with the exception of the 'Neutral Zone”), art; held by the Kuwait Oil Company, Ltd., which is jointly owned by ahe Gulf E. ploratiort Company (British) and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (British). The concession was granted in 1934 and the first well was drilled in. 193&amp; but it was nou unuil 1939 that results justified full scale development. At the beginning of the war drilling ope rat ions were discontinued and in 1942 the existing wells were plugged. The oil reserves are known to be very large, and a project for developing a production of 2 , 5000,000 tors per annum by drilling 15 new wells in addition 10 the nine existing veils which have been muddied, off has been approved. There are a-iso plans tor ohe cons true— tion of a refinery. , _ 67 . Souti of Kuwait lies an area of some 1,000 square miles •ailed one. Neaoral Zone” in widen. Ibn Saud and the Shek.th of Kuwait enjoy-eqial rights under uhe Treaty of Uqair or Kuwait Boundary Convention of 1922, pending further agreemen't between «he^ two rulers. Jbn Saud has signed an agreement wi'th 't’ne Arabian A eric an 0.ul Co. ex ounding uheir Saudi Arabian concession to cover his (Ibn Baud’s,) rights in the Neutral oone but the Sheikh of Kuwait on his side, though he has been approached by at least two oil companies with a view to a concession, has consisten - 1 $' refused to discuss ohe quest.! n of his rights. Possibly lie hopes, on the derut 1 of Ibn Saud, Lo implement his claim to the entire area. Arabi 68 . In 1942 the Arabian A orican Oil Company proposed to the joint chiefs of Staff in Washington the construction of a pipeline from Bahrein across Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean, put ing forward, strategic reasons as 'tho primary consi^erabiou. ±ho proposal however was turned down •'.•n trie grounds of lack of material ana the uncertainty of 'the military situation in the Middle East. 69 . Two years later the project was revived. By this i-ime the Germans been expelled from Africa and Southern Italy. Victory, though in sight, was noo yeo m hand. There was acute shortage of tankers and the proble: o.. supplying ii-l; - military operations on tine Continent loo- ed increasingly urgent. In the^ meanoime the v/ar had led to a very large drain upon American oil reserves. Tnis was Drought ouu in the Mead Report (See para 2) which stressed the fact that American ill rosiwves - u being rapidly send dangerously depleted o.r^d urged 'a positive, vigorous, American policy to assure to this country its share of the world’s petroleum resources'. 70. The findings of 'the Committee v/ere o.. particular importance to the j , /dependent as10 - depciiu-ont as it is upon oil fWr its main source 01 u over, anu U.o. navc.l aathoritius approached the U. *-&gt;• Secretary •f ..the Interior, kr. I dees, with arguments in favour- of the suggestion. A pipeline across Arabia, it w_e argued, by avoiding cho long and expensive voyage round Arabia and through the Sue?; Canad, would bring oil ouicaly anu cheaply to the Mediterranean area and Europe, tiu.s facilitating marketing and at the sanie time providing valuable supply points for the U.S. Navy. 71. Influenced by the considerations, and by the findings of the Petroleum Committee Secretary,lakes in early February 'IJl+k, suddenly announced r. proposal for an Auerlean pipeline to extend more than a thousand miles from the Bahre in-Kuwait oil area to tho Eastern Mediterranean c«ast. The c«st,, estinated at between £32 and £i1 million pounas sterling would be assumed by the Petroleum Reserves Corporation (P.R.C.), an American Govdmiuont Departiu^nt by Ur. lakes. - - In brief, the U.S. Government would construct, own and maintain the line. The cost of construction plus interest would bo returned to che Government by the companies concerned within 25 years, together with a share m the profits. In return the •perating companies would under take to.mintodm' 1,000 million barrels of oil for the naval and military forces •f£^he United States to be held in reserve, available any time for Government purchase ac 25 fo below the market price in the Persian Gulf region. Finally, the coi.r anies using the pipeline would, have to undertjike not to sell petroleum co any Government or people when the American Department judged such sales to be unwise in the lijac of J.S. forei n policy, 72. The proposal raised storms of protest. The new project had been worked out under conditions of great secrecy and its sudden announcement burst like a bomb. The American Department of State protested that the project would jeopardise rhe success of Anglo-American negotiations for an oil agreement covering uhe 'oru^rly economic and equitable development and marketing of ttmir.okl reserves' on wnich -,ncy oere chLreaiy working. Rival American companies, particularly those engaged in soilin^ cheir pro ducts on the European markets, protested violently against chis new anu didigerous competitor and claimed that the figures of the keau Report were incorrect cdid mis leading. Isolationist critics claimed that the new pipeline would involve America in international complications and rivalries, Final3.y, the majority ox 1 the oil inuustry in Aaerica damned the project as 'Fascist”, ana accused Secretary Ickes of tig i«T bring in Government ownership uf the oil inaustry. A xirst-class ooliticx.I row developed, in face of which the project was temporarily siielve-d pending An^lo-American negotiations on the whole question of post-v/ar oil exploitation. On June 20 it was .reported that the project had been abandoned in favour of a Government roan to i.ne oj. 1 companies to help them to build the pipeline themselves. 73. In the m^tfintime official discussion, on qil questions had seen opened &gt;eo.. ; een England and America, and finally, in September, 19k5j the Anglo-A-.crican Oil Treaty was signed in London. Under the terms of this treaty it was stipulated tamo both countries would have equal facilities for oil exploitation in the Middle Ease area. 74. Following this Treaty, the Arab ia-A.ierican Oil Company set up, in 1945, a subsidiary company, the Trans -Arabian Pipeline Company, to carry out the ^necessary preparations and negotiations with a view to the eventual construction ox a pipeline across Arabia to the Meuiterranean coast. In January 1946 concessions were granted for the pipeline to cross Transjordan and Palestine to the sea. The exact termini^, was not specified. Haifa has been suggested but against this it is cjrgued that as Ham-a_is already the terminus of the pipeline from Iraq, the port will eventually be too small to cope with all the shipping involved. On strategical considerations also, ohere are objections to too great a concentration in one area. It is suggested that the new pipeline, if constructed, might find a. suitable termin'us further south. 1 he question has been left open to further study.Explo rato ry Work in Non-Pr o ducing Areas Sy ria and L ebanon. 75* Exploratory work began in 1935 under seven permis de reoherohes granted to the Iraq Patroloum Company, hut it was not until 1532 that an agreement wss signed, Subject to ratification by the Syrian Parliament, with Peeroleum Concessions (Syria and Lebanon), Ltd., the name of which was later changed to Syrian Petroleum Company.

Repeated Political Agent, Koweit Dated No 8th January, 1947 Ext.46/47. S ECRET You will have seen reports in the press that the Anglo Iranian Oil Company has concluded in principle agreements for the sale of substantial quantities of crude oil to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the Socony Vacuum Oil Company over a period of years; and that a term of these agreements provides for the prior investigation by the parties of the possibility of constructing a pipeline from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. 2. Following additional details are for your confidential information only. 3. The route and Mediterranean outlet of the pipeline are still under discussion but, from the point of view of H.M.G., an outlet in the south of Palestine at present appears preferable to other alternatives. The pipeline will have a capacity of 15 million tons per annum or possibly more. The total quantities to be sold by A.I.C.C. will be of the order of 125 million tons over 20 years. The oil may be supplied from A.I.O.C^s Persian or Koweit sources and the American companies will be free to dispose of it as they see fit. 4. H.M.G. is anxious that there should be no impression created, either here, in the United States or in the Middle East that this deal is other than an ordinary commercial and non- discriminatory transaction as in fact it is. Please bear this in mind if you have to answer any questions arising out of the announcement of the scheme. 5. A refinery operated jointly by the partners in the pipe line scheme may be built at the Mediterranean terminal. If agreement is not reached on this between the partners, A.I.O.C. have intimated that they will themselves probably proceed independently on this basis in order to provide facilities for the treatment of their 50 % share of the oil coming through the pipeline. A.I.O.C. have stated that they do not repeat not contemplate building a refinery in Koweit. 6. The intercompany arrangements are still in their early stages and any questions about it which may be put to you by the Sheikh of Koweit or from other sources should be dealt with on the basis (see paragraph 4 above) that this is a purely commercial arrangement and you are therefore transmitting the enquiry to London. 7.

In the face of fierce competition from American firms, the British General Electric Company has secured the £300,000 contract for the production and installation of this communications link ^hich will span the desert. * The contract will provide work for 5,000 employees of Coventry branches of G.E.C. When the equipment is built, operators in desert transmitting stations will be able to dial a number and speak immediately to operators at other stations on the line, altaough the only connection between them will be a radio beam. ’’Walkie-Talkie” apparatus and mobile wireless trucks will keep working parties building the pipeline in close touch with each other and base camps. When the pipe is completed, meters along the line will automatic ally flash radio signals to tell whether the oil is flowing freely. This will enable breakdown gangs to obtain instant checks on stoppage: Radio communication will a^so be kept with aircraft flying over the pipeline route and with ships entering port.

American Oil Development f X \ major oil companies ultimately plan the daily movement of 'at least” 1,500,000 barrels of oil from Middle Eastern wells to Medditerranean ports. Mr. James Tert^Duce, Vice-President of the Arabian American Oil Co., reported JLp^Washington yesterday. He told the House Commerce Committee that his company, in the Saudi Arabian fields, now produces 315,000 barrels a day. This production, he said, could ’’easily” be increased if permission were g given for exporting steel for new construction. He predicted that the next pipeline to be built in the Middle East would run from Abadan and probably Kuwait to the Levant coast, possibly into Syria. This line, he said, would be built by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in partnership with Standard Oil of New Jersey and the Secony-Vacuum Oil Co. It is expected to be completed by 1953. He said the Iraq Petroleum Co. was considering a major line from Kirkuk and other nearby fields, and the Gulf Corp. and Shell Co. were discussing a line from Kuwait. Both would go the Levant coast.&gt;&gt;* - page 2 - 'When all of these lines are completed', he told the Committee, ed daily upon the shores of Lebanon, Palestine and oyria, and tms wi be available for European markets and will enable the producing compan ies in Venezuela and Columbia to ship oil to the U.S.A. instead o,. to the European markets'. Middle East production, he said, was expected to increase from 872,000 barrels per day to 1,624,000 by 1961. 33. Pipeline News . Despite the unstable situation in the Middle East, the Transarauian Pipeline Company still proposes to complete about 1950 the pipeline * linking Saudi Arabia with the Mediterranean. Mr. E.Hull, the Company’s president, declared that the transfer of workers from Syria and Lebanon to Saudi Arabia - 'made necessary by the present situation in Palestine' - had resulted in a speeding up of the work. He added that the pipeline, when complete, will permit the daily transport of more than 300,000 barrels of petrol, thus permitting the American Government no longer to draw on its reserves. The decision to carry on construction work on the pipeline^was taken following a decision by King Ibn Saud that the interests ot the American oil companies in Saudi Arabia would be safeguarded whatever happened elsewhere. A report presented by the company declares that work is steadily going on in the construction of housing, docks, causeways, pipe joining plant and water wells along the route.

Washington, 8th August, 1944. Introductory Article. The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, whose nationals hold, to a substantial extent jointly, rights to explore and develop petroleum resources in other countries, recognise: — 1. That ample supplies of petroleum, available in international trade to meet increasing market demands, are essential for both the security and economic well-being of nations; 2. That for the foreseeable future the petroleum resources of the world are adequate to assure the availability of such supplies; 3. That such supplies should be derived from the various producing areas of the world with due consideration of such factors as available reserves, sound engineering practices, relevant economic factors, and the interests of producing and consuming countries, and with a view to the full satisfaction of expanding demand; 4. That such supplies should be available in accordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter and in order to serve the needs of collective security; 5. That the general adoption of these principles can best be promoted by international agreement among all countries interested in the petroleum trade whether as producers or consumers. Article I. The two Governments agree that the development of petroleum resources for international trade should be expanded in an orderly manner on a world wide basis with due consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph 3 of the Introductory Article and within the framework of applicable laws or concession contracts. lo this end, and as a preliminary measure to the calling of the international conference referred to in Article II below, the two Governments will so direct their efforts, with respect to petroleum resources in which rights are held or may be acquired by the nationals of either country: — 1. That, subject alw r ays to considerations of military security and to the provisions of such arrangements for the preservation of peace and prevention of aggression as may be in force, adequate supplies of petroleum shall be available in international trade to the nationals of all peaceable countries at fair prices and on a non- discriminatory basis ; -j. That the development of petroleum resources and the benefits received t herefrom by the producing countries shall be such as to encourage the sound economic advancement of those countries;3 3. That the development of these resources shall be conducted with a view to the availability of adequate supplies of petroleum to both countries as well as to all other peaceable countries, sub ject to the provisions of such collective security arrangements as may be established; 4. That, with respect to the acquisition of exploration and development rights in areas not now under concession, the principle of equal opportunity shall be respected by both Governments; 5. That the Government of each country and the nationals thereof shall respect all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights, and shall make no effort unilaterally to interfere directly or indirectly with such contracts or rights; 6. That, subject always to the considerations mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, the exploration for and development of petroleum resources, the construction and operation of refineries and other facilities, and the distribution of petroleum shall not be ham pered by restrictions imposed by either Government or its nationals, inconsistent with the purposes of this Agreement. Article II. The two Governments recognise that the principles declared in Article I hereof are of general applicability and merit adherence on the part of all countries interested in the international petroleum trade of the world. Therefore, with a view to the wider adoption and effectuation of the principles embodied in this Agreement they agree that as soon as prac ticable they will propose to the Governments of other interested producing and consuming countries an International Petroleum Agreement which, inter alia, would establish a permanent International Petroleum Council composed of representatives of all signatory countries. To this end the two, Governments hereby pledge themselves to formu late plans for an international conference to consider the negotiation of such a multilateral Petroleum Agreement. They also pledge themselves to consult with other interested Governments with a view to taking what ever action is necessary to prepare for the proposed conference. Article III. There are, however, numerous problems of joint immediate interest to the two Governments, with respect to petroleum resources in which rights are held or may be acquired by their nationals, which must be discussed and resolved on a co-operative interim basis if the general petroleum supply situation is not to deteriorate. With this end in view the two Governments hereby agree to establish an International Petroleum Commission to be composed of eight members, four members to be appointed immediately by each Government. This Commission, in furtherance of and in accordance with the principles stated in Article I hereof, shall consider problems of mutual interest to both Governments and their nationals, and, with a view to the equitable disposition of such problems, shall be charged with the following duties and responsibilities: ■— 1. To prepare long-term estimates of world demand for petroleum, having due regard for the interests of consuming countries and expanding consumption requirements; 2. To suggest the manner in which, over the long term, this estimated demand may best be satisfied by production equitably distributed4 among the various producing countries in accordance with the criteria enumerated in paragraph 3 of the Introductory Article; 3. To recommend to both Governments Iwoad policies for adoption bv operating companies with a view to effectuating programmes suggested under the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article; 4. To analyse such short-term problems of joint interest as may arise in connection with production, processing, transportation and distribution of petroleum on a world-wide basis, wherever the nationals of either country have a significant interest, and to I’ecommend to both Governments such action as may appear appropriate; 5. To make regular reports to the two Governments concerning its activities; 6. To make, from time to time, such additional reports and recommen dations to the two Governments as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Commission shall establish such organisation as is necessary to carry out its functions under this Agreement. The expenses of the Commission shall be shared equally by the two Governments. Article IV. To effectuate this Agreement the two Governments hereby grant reciprocal 'assurances: — 1. That they will adhere to the principles set forth in Article I, para graphs 1 to 6 inclusive; 2. That they will endeavour to obtain the collaboration of the Govern ments of other producing and consuming countries in the imple mentation of the principles set forth in Article I, and will consult, as appropriate, with such Governments in connexion with activities undertaken under Article III; 3. That upon approval of the recommendations of the Commission they will endeavour, in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures, to give effect to such approved recommendations;. 4. That each Government will undertake to keep itself adequately informed of the current and prospective activities of its nationals with respect to the development, processing, transportation and distribution of petroleum; 5. That each Government will make available to the Commission such information regarding the activities of its nationals as is necessary to the I’ealisation of the purposes of this Agreement. Article V. The two Governments agree that in this Agreement: — 1. The words “country” or “territories” (a) in relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, include, in addition to the United Kingdom, all British colonies, overseas territories, protectorates, protected States and all mandated territories administered by that Government; and (b) in relation to the Government of the United States of America, include, in addition to the United States, all territory under the jurisdiction of the United States;2. The word ‘ ‘ nationals ’ ’ means (a) in relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, all British subjects and British protected persons belonging to the territories referred to in 1 (a) above and all companies incorporated under the laws of any of the above-mentioned territories, and also companies incorporated elsewhere in which the controlling interest is held by any of such nationals; (b) in relation to the Government of the United States of America, all nationals of the United States including companies incorporated under the laws of the territories referred to in 1 (b) above, and also companies incorporated elsewhere in which the controlling interest is held by any of such nationals; 3. The word “ petroleum ” means crude petroleum and its derivatives. Article VI. This Agreement shall enter into force upon a date to be agreed upon after each Government shall have notified the other of its readiness to bring the Agreement into force and shall continue in force until three months after notice of termination has been given by either Government or until it is superseded by the International Petroleum Agreement contemplated in Article II.

In keeping with the earlier discussions on the subject of foreign exchange, the following conclusions were reached. It was agreed by both Delegations that the terms of the Agreement provide for due consideration by the Commission of the foreign exchange position of each country. The United Kingdom Delegation stated that during the post-war transi tional period referred to in the draft Agreement for the International Monetary Fund, the United Kingdom might be obliged to take into account the exchange which it would lose or gain by the purchase or sale of petroleum in deciding the sources from which the petroleum it requiredshould be drawn; that this situation would continue until sterling became treely convertible and all restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions have been removed. The United States Delegation took note of this statement Thev pointed out, however, that if the United Kingdom Government were to take unilateral action in this sense, the effect would be inconsistent with certain of the purposes of the Agreement. It was agreed, therefore, that before any such action was taken the “ s .° ul( J be Piaced before the International Petroleum Commission which, with due regard to the principles of the Agreement, should seek a solution acceptable to the two Governments; failing agreement on such a solution the Commission should consider the desirability^ recommending to the two Governments a suspension of the Agreement in whole or in part. It was agreed that should the Commission be unable to make anv recommendation acceptable to the two Governments, the Government presenting the problem to the Commission would exercise its right to S' A te T rmm j te tI , ie A g reernent in accordance with the provisions ( Article VI. In order that such termination could take place within a reasonable length of time, it was agreed that term of notice in the Agree ment should be shortened from six months to three months. 8 2 ‘ .^ be two Delegations then agreed to submit the Agreement to their StX^ ernmentS Wlth the recommend ation that it should be entered 12498 Wt. 9/44 F.O.P. 28109 Op. 340 WMriMR’mmmtmmtu Para :&lt;ef: G. of I. ^.0.
