India, Apart from the Sultan’s wishes in the matter, it is of course desirable that the Political Agent, Muscat, or other Government representative should he present during any discussions on oil matters between His Highness and Hr, Longrigg. If it is thought unnecessary for the Political Agent to accompany the Sultan to India, I assume that the Government of India will arrange for some other official to he present at the diecuasions. I should he glad to receive in due course a full record of the discussions. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. Muscat, csgcL) p. mmovNote on discussion at meeting held at Bombay on November «4th between His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Mr.S.H.Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Limited at which Major R.P.Watts Political Agent was present. Mr.Longrigg first explained to the Sultan what areas in the Sultanate his Company considered, from information available, were the most lixely to be ox geological interest. He said that the ©o®,sta 1 region lying between the mountains and the sea north oi Muscat known as the Batinah was of little interest to the Company also the extreme north of the Mussandum feninsuiar. The coastal region south of Muscat more especially that between Ras al Had up to Has Dhabit Ali might be of somewhat more interest and the Company desired to carry out exploration of those parts. The portion of the Sultanate, however, which the Company considered to be best deserving of exploration was^Mr.Longrigg declared^the western foothills of the main Oman mountain range. Mr.Longrigg asked whether the Sultan could - V* I) I arrange ( whenever the Company desired)^^^ prospecting parties to visit and explore this regionT^and provide measures to ensure their safety. The Sultan replied that at the present moment he was quite unable to state in any definite whether suitable arrangements could be made or not. He would of course as provided under Article 12 oi the Oil Concession use his good offices to provide for the safe conduct of the personnel of the Company visiting any place in his dominions, but owing to the peculiar conditions prevailing in the Oman it would for him to make careful inquiries into the be necessarycue matter before he could commit himself to saying whether he could arrange for such a reconnaisance in those districts or not since he would not be returning Iroru his world tour until May of next year some time must elapse before he could give a definite answer to this question, Mr.Longrigg said that though the Company did not intend to carry out any active work until the autumn of 1938 they aesired to know as early as possible in advance what programme could be made for their prospecting parties in order that the numerous arrangements and preparations necessary might be put in hand at an early date. The Sultan said that at this time he was quite unable to commit himself to any sort of a definite reply as to what portions of the territory mentioned by Mr.Longrigg as being of interest to the Company could be visited , ! -und ora rTangemte-n-ts- - ^ As regards the south -weetern coastal portion of his territory i.e. that between das al Had and Has Dhabat Ali the Sultan said that he thought there would be no difficulty after his return to Muscat next year, in arranging for the Company’s employees to and prospect from the coast as iar as the western limits of the Sultanate i.e. the beginning of the great Sands and as lar as the territory belonging to Ibn Saud. Dhofar the Sultan declared was well under his control, and the only important Sheikhs of the remaining portion of the Coastal range were the Sheikhs of MahH. Mahut and Masirah with both of whom he was well acquainted and who were amenable to his authority. Mr.Longrigg mentioned that his Company might desire * to carry out some aerial reconnaissances of the Sultanate and asked whther the Sultan had any objection to their aeroplanes using the existing landing grounds made for the Royal Air Force. The Suitanthe tiUj-tan said he had no objection but stressed importance of ample notice being given in order that the Sheikhs and Headmen of the districts to be flown over should be aware of the Ending identity of the visiting aeroplanes. to the present the Sultan explained only Hoyal Air Porce^lanes had visited his Arabian territory'and the sudden appearance of another type of^plane and of persons not belonging to the Hoyal Air Force might lead to misunderstandings and perhaps unpleasantness from the local inhabitants. Mr.Longrigg promised that as long warning as possible of all flights projected would be given. » Mr.Longrigg ashed what would probably happen tyjUQ ix one ox the Company * s ^planes was obliged to mahe a fi iorced descent in the interior of the country. The Sultan said that .though he sincerely hoped that no harm would come to the occupants of the^plane a^art from the coastal belt where he was able to exercise some control over the inhabitants he was quite unable to say what would happen and certainly could accept no responsibility for the safety of their lives. Mr.Longrigg suggested that it might be desirable to have a representative of the Muscat Government in the &lt; 5 ^^ planes when engaged on such flights and the Sultan {£ agreed saying for each district visited a man that — —— Ufc^tribe should be taxen. Mr.Longrigg called on the Sultan again on S5th accongjanied by the political Agent, to say good Dye as he was leaving for the Gulf that evening. The only official subject spoken about was the question raised by Mr.Longrigg at the prior suggestion 01 the Political Agent of the degree of responsibility the Sultan accepted for the actual coastal region with particular respect to the safety of the personnel of any aircraft belonging to the Company which might land there.i The Sultan said that so far as responsibility went even in the landing grounds he was not prepared to promise anything more then to do his utmost to ensure law and order and to safeguard the lives of the Cornpany f s employees./*** s Mr.Longrigg then went on to explain that there were three areas in which his Company wished to pursue further explorations, viz: (a) Jebel Fayah and the country of the south and south-east thereof; country east and south of the Baraimi Oasis with Jebel Hafit, and to the south and south-east thereof; f (b) The Muscat areas, controlled by the Imam and the Beni Bu Ali tribe; and (c) The south-east coast of Muscat as far as Dhofar. ♦To, £ ombay.

No. T/101 f : « ' ) S Subj eet Muscat Oil Agreement. 2. In accordance with instructions contained in your telegram No. 1033 of 27th October 1937, I gave the Sultan in Bombay a copy of the Draft political Agreement together with copies of the letters drafts of which numbered 1 and 3 respectively were enclosed in India Office letter No.P.Z.4683/37 dated August 7 1937 and modified in India Office telegram No.5098 of 27th October 1937. 3. The Sultan's reaction was startingly hostile. After giving a hasty glance at the letters he became very excited and declared that it would be quite impossible to go through all the numerous questions arising out of the draft agreement in the short time left before his departure from India. I then asked him whether he would have liked me to have taken up this matter with him at Delhi while he was there or during the two weeks prior to his departure from Muscat when we were occupied in negotiations over the new 'freaty. The Sultan agreed that neither of tuese times would have been suitable for consideration of this question. 1 pointed out that there were four complete days left before the date of his departure from Bombay and that this would give more sufficient time if be would peruse the two letters with me he would find them both and the draft quietly with me „„„ nsrfactly easy to understand.2 . 4. The 3ultan by this time was nearly in tears exclaiming that his subjects would have small respect for him if he decided such an important question in a our day s. I pointed out that he had completed the whole of the Oil Agreement with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in 9 days and this was far more complicated, difficult and longer than the Political Agreement between the Company and Hia Majesty *3 Government to which he was now being asked merely to give his concurrence. The Sultan replied that whereas the Agreement with the Company was merely one concerning money the Political Agreement involved matters affecting his control over his state. 5. After some further discussion I persuaded the Sultan with difficulty to read the Draft Agreement with me. The first point he raised was to ask what was the 'Understanding' referred to in paragraph 1 of my letter ( Draft Ho. I vide paragraph 1 above). I replied that X thought it was clear that this understanding referred to the communication I had made verbally to him at the time when negotiations for the oil concessions were being carried out in Muscat in June of this year that any concession to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. would be subject to a Political Agreement to be concluded between the Company and His Majesty's Government. The Sultan excitedly exclaimed that all he understood me to say at that time was that there would he a Political Agreement between Hie Majesty-s Government and the Company hut not that the Commercial Agreement would depend for its approval upon it. 1 replied that I t „»b.,.d “ =“ a * 1, * , I had raninded hla of ■hat I had ali'eacy aantionedany agreement on a previous occasion at Dhofar that entered into between the Sultan and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. would have to be approved of by His Majesty* s Government who would make a separate Political Agreement with the Company, i added that I had mentioned this matter on a second occasion during the negotiations at Muscat when Mr, Lermitte the Representative of the Company was present and tha^ l felt certain that the latter would support my statement. The Sultan persisted in maintaining that he had understood my remarks in quite a different sense. 6. This is not the first time that the Sultan*s memory and understanding has become conveniently defective. IXiring his recent visit to Delhi he informed me that at an interview with H.S. the Viceroy, the Foreign Secretary Sir Aubrey Metcalfe had informed him definitely that the Arms Traffic Subsidy would be restored if the Sultan made a written official request for it. When X asked the Foreign Secretary the following day whether the Sultan*s statement was correct he entirely repudiated it and explained what he actually had said which was quite a different matter. (In this connection please see my express letter lTo.T/92 dated November 26. 1937. ) In my opinion there is no question of the Sultan having so completely misunderstood the sense of what I told him in Muscat regarding the Political Agreement. He was anxious at the time not to raise any obstacle which might result in delaying the advance payment of the money coming to him under the terms of the Commercial Agrees® 11 *' readily accepted what I explained to him quite clearly of the necessity of obtaining His Majesty’s Governmen4 / approval of that agreement. 7. The Sultan after I had calmed him down a little, asked what was the object of having this Political Agreement SJfcwn him at all. He would have, he said. no objection to any sort of agreement which His Majesty* s Government might desire to enter into with the Company so long as it would not adversely affect his interests* 1 pointed out that his query was exactly answered in paragraph 3 of the letter given him (Draft letter Ho, I) and all other matters on which His Majesty’s Government desired their interests to be safeguarded were fully explained and set forth in the various articles of the Agreement itself. The Sultan then exclaimed that he could not understand the Agreement, so I asked to tell me what points in it were puzzling him and I would endeavour to clear them up. We then read over a portion of the Agreement the Sultan raising numerous objections to the various matters dealt with in the different articles. I do not propose ( unless you so desire,to give now in detail his objections since I found that during the discussions we had on the subject on three successive days what the Sultan completely acquiesced in one day he violently objected to the next and vice versa and in his reply which he has promised to send from Singapore to my letters mentioned in paragraph 2 above he will quite probabljr have altered his ideas once more and raise different objections. When his letter is received which should be shortly as he said he would despatch it by Air Mail before his departure from Singapore on December 14th, X can then, when forwarding it to you, comment if necessary on the various points he may iaise with aview to elucidating where possible the reasons for his objections thereto. 3. As was apparent during the negotiations over the revision of the 1891 Treaty the Sultan is inordinately sensitive and suspicious of agreeing to any thing which may in his opinion curtail his full and complete sovereign powers as an independent Ruler and I gathered that it was some such fear that has made him so strot»gly hostile to the Political Agreement. As mentioned by you in your recent despatch giving an appreciation of his character the Sultan is not always as ready to cooperate with as he is to ask for assistance and privileges from His Majesty*s Government. 9. The Sultan asked me whether it would be possible for him when in England to call at the India Office and discuss this matter of the Political Agreement. ]%Hfl that time f he said, he would have been able to think over things and clarify his ideas on the subject. I replied that I did not think there would be any objection to his doing so but that I should have of course to refer the matter to you. (StL) MS.

Bated 8 th Dece&amp;ber 1937 Uo.T /102 ♦ I forward herewith a note on the discussions 'between the Sultan of Muscat and Mr. Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Ltdy( held at Bombay on November 24 at which I was present. 2. As will be seen therefrom the result of the discussions was mostly a negative one since the Sultan refused to commit himself to stating whether those parts of his dominions in which the Company were most interested ifithe western foothills of the Oman mountain range could be visited by geologists under arrangements to be made by him ox* not. The reason for the Sultan 1 s attitude is, of course, that as he has no control whatsoever over the Oman he is not in a position at present to say whether he will be able o* not to arrange for the Company’s employees to prospect there for oil* s. According to the Sultan in recent conversations I had with him shortly before leaving Muscat the authority of the Imam over the Oman is dwindling and I think that the Sultan has hopes that when he returns from his world tour next year he .;iay be able to g into direct touch with many ' t -‘ e tribes , oT .ronse with them to all-w controlled by the Imam and arrange wi + to explore their territory. (I am prospecting parties to explore r-otp report on the situation in submitting a separate rep 4 . learnt \ Whatever may be tne the Oman on my return to Muscat.)

Longrigg expressed himself as disappointed at the negative result of Ms discussions with the Sultan but I pointed out that his Company by the insertion in their o\?n Agreement of article 12 were evidently aware of the fact that certain areas of the Sultanate were not under the control of the Muscat Government* 5* Prior to our meeting with the Sultan Hr* Longrlgg and myself had a short talk in which I gave him a general idea of the Political situation in the Sultanate* Hr. hongrigg asked me whether I thought it advisable for him to discuss with the Sultan the question of his meeting the Imam* I said that in view of the Sultan 1 s very strong objections to this proposal (Vide paragraph 1 of my telegram Ho* 106 of 18th October 1937) I saw no useful purpose in it being raised. Mr. Longrlgg agreid and the question was not mentioned at all during the interviews with the Sultan. 6.

As instructed in your telegram No. T/13 of 25th November, X went on Board the S.S. Bamora on the 30th November to meet Major Longrigg. 2. X had arranged transport for his visit to Mattrah, etc., but he requested me to accompany him to see Dr. Harrison. 3. I was present at the meeting (at Major Longrigg's special request) between Major kongrigg and Dr. Harrison in the latter’s office. The arguments were interesting generally about Arabia and the Arabs and the convens&amp;tion then veered round to oil matters,Major Longrigg disclosed who he was. Dr. Harrison appeared to be fully conversant with the Muscat Oil concessions and from what he said it struck me that he must have been the Sul Tan’s adviser in H.H’s degotiatioxis with Mr. Lermitte. 4 # On the special matter of the preliminary survey, Major i^ongrigg told Dr. Harrison that ne was not at all interested in the coastal belt but what he wanted to get at was of the Imam, esp.eially Jabal Akhdaij/. According to Major Longrigg the Company had lost over the Muscat Concession and their only hope lay in the interior; and if the Company's employees could not get into tnis territory the Company might consider giving up the concession. Dr. Harrison then said that as he was very friendly with the Imam of Oman he would speak to him (the Imam) if -aj°r ^ngrigg so desired t • + 'hsenicpd him and said that be it. Major Longrigg thanked aim ai would probably write to Dr Harrison from time to ti 5 .

The letter on the subject which the Sultan promised , rt ce w ith instructions contained in end of last month, in accordance witn „ v . tc&gt;le „ raB quoted above, X forward herewith a naracraph 2 of your telegram quo** paragrap , ^ the Sultan in Bombay of certain objections raised by the against the Draft Political Agreement between His Majes Government and Petroleum Concessions Xi.it^d. ^ 2 The first objection raised by the oultan ..a in sub-paragraph 2 of paragra^ X, -whereas cer tel „ ibiiities will devolve on His Majesty*s Government . responsibilities The Sultan demanded U know ho., it ccul •&gt; ^ His Majesty’s Government on that responsibilities devolved on His uaj V „ oV Tled out in his dominions, account of any work earned o ^4* I replied that so far as I understand this point, since Petroleum Concessions Limited was a British Company who proposed to operate in a foreign territory, the question of looking after their interests and their^welfare of their personnel generally was a responsibility which devolved on His Majesty* s Government in the same way as that of all British subjects dwelling in Muscat limits was their concern* The Sultan said nothing further on this point but was clearlj not satisfied with the explanation given* 3# The Sultan took exception to the second half of paragraph 3 of the Draft Agreement. He declared that as worded it would enable either His Majesty* s Government or the Company to get rid of all the Muscat! or neighbouring Arab State subjects employed by the Company under Article 16(b) of the Commercial Agreement on the grounds that their labour was inefficient* I replied that Article 16(b) of the Commercial Agreement to which he had already given consent also laid down that if the Company found that the local labour was inadequate ©r unsuitable they should have the right to import labour* I added that the object and meaning of this clause in the Draft Political Agreement was perfectly clear to me* Oil prospecting and oil boring operations were, X explained, a highly technical business of which all the specialised experts in the numerous branches thereof were not usually to be found in any one nation. It might well be found necessary to obtain the services of certain individuals nfco were neither British nor Muscat!* The Sultan however persisted in his objection.--5-- 4# Eefercnco paragraph 4 of Draft Political Agreement. The Sultan said he failed to see why his Government should not deal ?/ith the Company direct in all matters without reference to the Agency or any other British Representative. He declared that at present he and his otiicialg deal'v direct with British subjects when they had any business with thesu I pointed out that this procedure was only observed in routine or unimportant matters which as expressly provided for in the Draft Agreement could also be conducted direct by the Muscat Stats authorities and the Company. The effect of this Article X said would be merely to bring the conduct of the Company’s affairs in line with what has been the procedure in the past for all dealings between British firms and subjects and the Muscat Government. The Sultan was unable to refute this argument but obstinately persisted in his objection to the proviso in the Agreement. 5. Reference paragraph 7. The Sultan objected to the inclusion of the words (in line 6 and line IS) “or Eis Majesty’s Government” as giving the latter certain rights in his territory which would amount to an encroachment on his Sovereign rights. I replied that there ms no question ©f any such encroachment of tire Sultan’s rights being intended and obviously before Eis Majesty’s Government proposed t© acquire the use of any area of ground in Muscat territory for any of the purposes named they would, as in the past, obtain the Sultan’s consent beforehand. Reference paragraph 9. The Sultan objected to the whole ol this paragraph. He said that hia concurrence ae to whether a state of national emergency or war existed should he required and in any case he objected to the right under those circumstances of His Majesty's Government to pre-emption of all oil produced in his country. AsAs regards the first i^rt of the Sultan's objection X asked hip. whether he considered he was capable of Judging the exact position of the relations which migiit arise 'between Great Britain and some .Foreign lower and whether it would amount to a national emergency or state of war. The Sultan admitted he would not be able to judge* Concerning pre-emption I pointed out that under the terms of the Agreement entered into between him and the Company all the oil found in the State belonged to the latter and what was don® with, it was the Company's concern* The Sultan had no answer t© this argument but refused t© agree to the Article. 7. Reference paragraph 10. The Sultan became very excited when he. read the words * Xn order that the Sultan may be in a position to fulfill his responsibilities for tbe protection of toe Company* He accepted, he declared, no responsibility ior any of the personnel of the Oompauy when wording in his territory or for that Matter any person Muscat! or foreigner and had laid down this condition clearly in Clause 12 of the Commercial Agreement* X promptly produced a copy of the Commercial Agreement and showed the rfuxtan tae Article to which he referred and also Article 17 in which 1 explained that as I understood the question his responsibilities were more or less defined. The Sultan persisted in maintaining that this Article imposed no responsibility on him. 8. As regards the Draft letter (Ko.l) enclosed with India Office letter Fo.P.Z 4633/3? dated August 7 1937 and modified in India Office telegram ho. 5093 of 27th October 1937 , the Sultan declared he would not agree to the inciusxon of any such restriction as was laid down in paragraph 3(A) of w 4»1rtthe seid letter. I gathered that the Sultan considered this would he derogatory to his rights as an independent Ruler, ^• It will be seen from the above record of the discussions on the Draft Political Agreement and Draft setter referred to in the preceding paragraph that the Sultan*s objections were neither valid nor reasonable and in fact at times rather fatuous* I have often noticed that ills Highness 'shen discussing any subject requiring concent* ration becomes mentally fatigued very rapidly* At the second interview I had on this subject after we had discuss ed various points for about one hour the Sultan suddenly seized his head with both hands and exclaimed *My poor head, my poor headl I cannot understand all these difficult things*, « After this I found it was impossible to continue the discussion. As mentioned in my Express Letter No.T/101 of 8th December 1937 the Sultan had promised me in Bombay that he would send me a letter from Singapore, where he was to remain for a whole week, in which he would set forth in detail his objections t© the Draft Political Agreement* As stated above this letter has not up to the time of writing/and I think that the Sultan has decided to wait and discuss the matter with his father Saiyid Taimur in Japan before replying* I received a telegram from His Highness on 24th December saying that he had arrived safely in Kobe and that a letter followed. The subject matter of thisletter was not mentioned but^/is possible that it may refer to the Draft Political /^reement and it is to be hoped that as a result of the wiser and more experienced counsels of the late Sultan the present Sultan's somewhat strange objections to the Agreement as put forth to me in Bombay may be found to have been withdrawn.

You will remember that I asked His Highness to consider our exploration problem in two stages or zones: (1) the south coast, and (2) the foothill area immediately west and south-west of the mountain range from Has Musandam to Has al Hadd. As regards the south coast, the Sultan said that if we wished to send a party, he could send for the Rulers of the Beni Bu Ali ana ttie J anaba. take this to involve in particular the Amir oi tne Js’alen and the Shaikh of Masirah, resident at or near Mahut. The Sultan would give these people instructions to look us would P-iae o- representatives with letters ° ear ,f,,':r hll+ would Wd let us use what c ^Uon wl?h our not assume any in inland areas or people*s safety, more esp ^ ^ view of our those remote from landing—&amp;ro * , , rnl1T »epif*^ bSilf (confirmed ^conversations -thyourself) g that the Sultan's actual authority m mau- 2 - very slight, it cannot he said that the assistance outlined hy him did much to remove our feeling that conditions are unfavourable to exploration there, and are likely to remain so. At the same time, if we did send a party to that area, it would have the general blessing of the Sultan, and such assistance as it was in his power to give. Ac, regards the second of the zones above mentioned, the Sultan, admitted 6 that »&gt; pr elude ejplordttou under his M suggestion was that tni~ already extending his last for ever, and that he was |f^ derstood f ro m influence in the hmterlan . 0 pp 0 se any direct you that the Sultan ™^ d ®g r i m ^ y or P other hinterland apuroach by ourselves -houph things must remain as authorities it looks as though^tn^ the -STLs.

Some three years ago, i.e. before our departure towards the end of 1935 to Bhofar, We asited you to look for and select a British company to search for oil in our territory. %e gave priority to and preferred and wanted a British company in view of the friendly feeling We bear towards our friend His Majesty’s Government which is not unknown to them. In 1936 when you visited us in Dhofar you informed ua that you had found a British company who desired to make an agreement with us. fou said that their representative would come to see us when We arrived in Muscat. We were pleased to hear this. When we returned to Kusoat in the beginning of last year, and you also returned from Karachi in March of tine same year, you delivered to us a letter from a ax.Hoimes. iou said tuat he represented the Company, and that he wanted to come as soon as possible to open discussions, we replied agreeing to his coming. He then promised to you that he would arrive as soon as possible, but he did not do so Richly th.» meantime the Honourable the political! as he informed you. in the meantime w 4 on cuif arrived in Muscat in April when a Resident in the Persian Gulf ariive * v . to ittf o about the said Representative, and the discussion took aoo^ , „ &gt;tLt he would come very soon. #• remained political Resident^that he woui to leave for India in dun , e4 an int imation came to us and informed us that you n. me . of theirs named kr.neruii™ from the Company that an •“R purpose instead for tbe same P ur ^ ac would arrive in unseat that wee* ^ d ^ arture fo r of Mr.Holmes, fou requestea us .o pos p na were * i the man could arrive and discu another weeic until til ® , m concurred W i^our own interests in view entered into with nim. *ji ur.nermitte arrived to your request and postponed our P® ^ &amp;nd that you in Muscat, and you wrote informing us c al0M , it being should come wu — “ ‘ B *‘“ . *” a personal affair between u ^ ^ y.u, saying that vnu were not interested, in repi toatthat aas impossible, as We did not icno^ the Company and it was you who recommended it to us. We proposed that you should come v*ith the Company’s Kepresentative to introduce him to us, and that #e should then proceed to discuss matters with him . tou approved of and acted according to Our proposal. Having been introduced to Us the Company* s Representative put forth his % Company’s conditions and we proceeded with the discussions with him until tfe concluded the agreement with him on the 24th June 1937. 3. Before signing the agreement, however, we assea to toe present. When you came we started signing the copies of agreementi and you, as the British Consul, attested the copies *ou then said to Us that Our friend Hts Majesty’s Oorermnent would enter into a political agreement with Ccmpany, it being a British Company| and that having helped the Company toy record- ing it to Us, His Majesty's GoTernment considered it necessary ---tain nriT y-^g wS which concerned them to bind the former with certain kSkXXX®*** ,1.0..

Then We signed the money receipts which were attested by you, and we and Mr. Lermitte mmlsx together went to the Eastern Hank at Karachi, and the latter Introduced to the Manager and paid Us the money which ms credited to our account.

Dear Mr. Peel, The question v/as raised by this Company in March 1937 as to whether aerial survey, carried out by a civilian firm for the exploration of the Trucial Coast hinterland and/or of the Sultanate of Oman, would be permitted. The India Office reply is contained in letter No. P.Z. 2926/37 dated May 18th, 1937. This reply was, on the whole, discouraging: and since that date the subject of aerial exploration has been pursued upon different lines - those of obtaining the co-operation of the R.A.F* for the work. The latter showed every willingness to co-operate.; but the distance of the territory concerned from their base in Iraq.? the unexpectedly heavy expense which would fall upon the Company, and the limitations of action necessarily imposed upon service machines, have made it impossible so far to proceed beyond the stage of discussion. It might therefore be reasonable to reconsider the use of civilian aircraft, in the eveno of the ^oard Company deciding to press on which the exploration of these difficult territories, as far as this is practicah The three general conditions laid down in paragraph of the India Office letter under reference can he fulfilled. As, however, the Trucial Shaikhs' control xn _ . . r . nr .. p than doubtful; and as the areas which they claim is 1 -hpq bevond such control, and territory chiefly of inoere options -tn - »* op tn.

(This would not, of course, apply to the Sultan of Muscat). As regards one type of machine, etc. which would be used, you may oe coi uain tha c we should, act under the best advice, and in no ignorance of the nature of the territory. Before committing ourselves we should certainly s eek your views and those of the Political Resident. The purpose of this letter is to verify from you - for the possible information of the Board, if they prove interested - that the objection which you felt to the use of civilian aircraft for exploration in these territories may be considered as no longer in force, provided that we act under the general guidance of the Political Resident, obtain permission as necessary from the Sultan of Muscat, and comply with civil aircraft regulations, if any, in the controlled portions of the territories of Dubai and Sharjah, where we hold concessions. You will appreciate that, if it is decided to pursue geological exploration during the next cold weather, a decision as to the use of aircraft will doubtless he necessary and your views on the matters here raised are essential to this.

Muscat Oil Concessions: Political Agreement. I called on nis Highness the Sultan today in order to discuss v/ith him certain amendments in the revised draft Political Agreement and draft letter suggested in order to meet the points raised hy him on the 27th April. In place if/hichj it of Article 3 of the Agreement the following' 1 ' was proposed: ad been scertained u In exercising their right under Article 16(b) of their /•telephone ? tie Company Concessions to import skilled and technical employees the ight be xpected to Company shall not employ persons of other than British ccept) nationality without the consent of the Sultan and of His % Majesty’s G-overnment (or the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) n . The Sultan had no objection to this alternative. As regards the draft letter I said we were prepared^ subject to the understanding discussed below? to omit the second half of the last sentence (from the words beginning ''after which...’). The Sultan accepted this also. He also? on going uhrough the drafts again, made certain minor suggestions on which I said I thought his wishes could he met. These were in uhe Ag ree ment: Article 5, omit the words 'and of the Poll weal ^ Officers subordinate to him'; Article 7, fo, the word or on behalf of the Sultan' read 'by the Sultan or by any person authorised by him'; Article 3, in the last line read 'by the Sultan or, with his permission, by His Majesty's Government or their agent'; while m the wait lette ashed that the opening words should indicate b^whom His i n i ri -pn-pnished v/ith a copy of tne Majesty’s Government had oec concessions. , T As regards the last sentence of the draft . , ...

Otherwise, I said, there would be nothing to show that the concessions had received the approval of Government as was required under his father’s undertaking of 1923. The Sultan displayed a very strong objection to the sending of such a letter. He was, he said, quite prepared, subject to the minor points he had raised, to assent to the terms and conditions of the draft Political Agreement and letter, but he could not see why the subsequent letter of approval was required. Was it not enough for His Majesty’s Government that ne v/as wix-'-ing to agree to the conditions laid down in the letter relating to the Political Agreement? What other sign of His hajesty s Government's approval was needed? Had not His Haje^ty Government brought the Company to him and thereby indicated that they were favourable to the granting of a concession by him to the Company? I explained that -01113 nad snovn that the Company was not disapproved 01 oy His Uajesty Government, but there still remained the terms of the concession, as to which Government might wish to mahe some suggestions to His Highness, and there was also the necessity , 4.v,q+ an understanding on certain in the view of Government, tnat an una matters (i.e. the Political Agreement) should be reached between His Majesty's Government and the Company. The Sultan then said that he had not been told a time of the negotiations that the approval of Government was — — -—- made ::r len derstood this v/as a master not concerned. agreement but he had und igr — - - ''GT.,,»v.i« „e «*»....* *“* qqqiL *•»* •*«“ Government, ann yob -binding iqP3 promise were regarded as d been followed if the U23 1 on/on him* The 1923 undertaking required that permission should he given Toy Government before the Sultan granted a concession; the proper procedure would therefore have been for him to seek approval before the concession was signed. If Government were now to send a letter intimating their approval of the concession the letter must be in reply to a request of his ? but he had not asked for it and it was not he who had furnished a copy of the concessions to Government (cf. his desire to amend the opening words of the draft letter). I said it seemed that what His Highness really v/ished was to be released from the 1923 undertaking. He said he did not regard it as 'binding on him, and that it was not included in the obligations which he accepted on his accession. I said this was a view that Government could not possibly accept t would enable him to repudiate any of the obligations nourred by his predecessors whenever he thou#* it convenient, ven a solemn treaty could be disowned and Goveinment .ot tell on which of the undertakings of his predecessors they ould rely. The Sultan said that a treaty was suoject t •evision but the 19S3 undertaking on our view would be lerpetualiy'binding on Muscat and he could not assent to tna . le professed to draw a distinction between obligations wmc n An behalf of himself and his ■/ere accepted by a Suita , . live that of 1923, which were successors, and undertakings, a ap’ain . , „ qultan m his own name.

For him to pursue the ma ctex u promise had . .r fi .overnment was that the P the present the view of . d for that devolved on him when he succeeded his iauhciftta*- 5 reason they considered it essential that they should intimate their approval of the concessions. After further discussion the Sultan eventually said that he would agree to the exchange of letters relating to the Political Agreement and recognised that he would subsequently receive a letter informing him that Government approved^, or did not object to 5 the concessions. This letter would not be sent in response to any request of his, and he would merely file it in his records and refrain from assenting to the procedure by acknowledging its receipt. (Sd,) J.P.GIBSOTT 29th April, 1938. ' r P • i* litchison p.319 ? lo.XX) Muscat Oil Concessions. Sir Trenchard Fowle and I saw His Highness the Sultan this morning. The Sultan had previously stated his position, representing that it was not made clear to him before he signed the Concession given to Petroleum Concessions Limited that it was subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government and that it would be accompanied by a 'PoliticaP' Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company which he Y/ould be asked to recognise in an exchange of letters. He had said that His Majesty's Government and the Company were free to make any agreement they liked on the matter ? hut that it was no concern of his. He would not admit that the position had been made clear to him by Major Watts. Sir Trenchard Fowle explained to the Sultan that the basis for the procedure to which he took objection was tne undertaking given by his father in his letter of 10oh January 1923, which with the other obligations descending from his father was accepted by His Highness upon his accession (m a letter dated 10th February, 1932). The Sultan said that he did not regard this undertaking as binding on him; the obligations he accepted in 1932 were those recorded on his files, and his files showed that his father, men it was explained to him in connexion with the possible termination of the Arms Traffic Subsidy that the grant of the subsidy was at the outset personal to Saiyid Faisal, wrote to the Politic, Agent to assert his view that if ohst we.e ~o tne) promises made by him to Government were personal to himselt The Sultan therefore and did not descend to his successors. rd the 1923 undertaking as did not rega Sir T. Powle said that to bne of descending upon him. His recollection he and the Sultan sai ^ he had no copy had not seen this letter, a vler , with him. It was made clear to the Sultani (\S°D t. 16(b) 2 . undermined the undertahing given by him in his letter of February 5 1932 3 and was entirely unacceptable. Further discussion showed that he did not feel really sure of his ground. Sir Trenchard Fowle then proposed? leaving aside the question of principle? to go through a revised draft of the political agreement and of a letter to be sent to the Sultan in connection therewith. These drafts were prepared? in consultation with the interested Government departments and with Petroleum Concessions Limited? with a view to meeting as far as possible the objections expressed by the Sultan to Major Watts last November in Bombay. The Sulxan took exception to the Article of the draft agreement relating to the employment of personnel by the Company; he said he had. no objection to the employment of skilled persons of British or other foreign nationality, but he required, m accordance with the -Concession, that the labourers to be employed should be his own sub jects or drawn from the neighbouring Aran countries, since such persons would be under his jurisdiction. Otherwise he hed we ohjeetio. te the revised «« »w«-»t. • ■ • tup terms of the revised draft Nor had he any objection go uhe , 4 . - There was no need? he said? letter except the last sen en . , n the approval of His Majesty's Government, for this reference 10 one ap x • i wiir to the statement that the Compaq and he objected partioulail/ t q p it Muscat, he said, was independent, would be informed of n. • •nripnt bv Government? ouc i and it was called mdependenu oy -cnuired before he coula g -i mvernment were xequlxca J approval oi c-o/c-mi really not free, and ir ..as an oil concession then ue • reality. ,, w his independence was noo a made obvious to others m n , objection to i -n^nhably be li^^ ie U:JJ He was told that there won - . this the draft leruexp o-u omitting the last sentence Gove rnrnent that their p, ,Hpw of His Majesty s uov would not alter the view on approval of the Concessi on was r as required. Sir/Sir Ti enchard Powle chen referred iso ilic negotiations which were taking place in London with His Highness for the grant of a concession in Gwadur, and said that here too His Majesty’s Government considered that the concession world require their approval. They had so informed the Companies. It was explained to the Sultan that a particular reason for this stipulation in the case of Gwadur : .:as the absence of a definite boundary between C-wadur and Kalat* It would be essential to demarcate the frontier if an oil concession were to be operated. The Sultan agreed? and was willing that when a concession was granted the matter should be discussed and arranged between him and the Government of Inoia (nob between him and the Khan of Kalat). But there was no immediate need for it. Because of this obstacle of the necessity for the approval of Government he had decided not to proceed vath the negotiations with the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions. He professed not -go be disappointed if there were no oil concession in Gwaclur (or in Muscat) and if no payments were made to him. He added however that of course he was entirely free to give any concessions he liked in respect of minerals (not oil), since Government could not point to any unde^ cakin 0 respec fc, (Sd.)

It is our present hope to use aircraft ox the prescribed type in connection with a land exploration party operating in that area during the cold weather of 1938/39. Such a party would probably, as you suggest, base itself on Muscat and other points on the Batinah coast, using motor transport as far as possible in the Batinah (which, however, is itself of little geological interest) and camel transport through the passes across the Hajar and to the west thereof. They would h i see as much of the slopes and foothills west of the main range (this being the territory of greater geological -hy the Sultan and/or ■ u_ l &lt;-&gt;n z'*a tt 'hp mado acoCoSicxe y interest) as can do iiiauo the Trucial chiefs. n -f havinp adeauate cone acts, an The importance oi navn 0 particularly a landing-ground, at Baraimi, is very apparent, since this would permit aerial exploration^! ^ greater area as well as serving as a base ^ t ^resent that the Shaikh of A u land.

The decision then reached v/as '‘that on the evidence then available these Islands appeared to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein? and that the burden of disproving his claim lay on other potential ' claimants 5 ’. This decision Y/as communicated verbally to Mr. Belgrave (by Mr. Walton) on the l 6 th July? 1936? and it was explained to him that it would be impossible to give a final ruling without knowing whether the Sheikh of Qatar has a claim? and hearing it if he has one. Hitherto no attempt has been made to determine the sovereignty of the islands in question as between Bahrein and Qatar; but in view of the manner in which it has been raised by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., a decision cannot be delayed further, and as a urst step it is suggested that we should obtain tne vie.&lt;s of Sir Trenchard Fowle. Sd. A.C.3. Symon 4/4 Sir T. Fowle, May we have your views please ? an early decision because the year s Sheikh expires on 1 st May. 3d. P.C.L. are pies sing for interval laid down by the ^.C.B.

Uciuil the unallotted '_'.rea' ! came into the front of the picture there v/as no object in H.M.G. giving a definite decision on tne Ownership of Kai/ar and this cuesfion could he left in the position described in xoara. 5 of your note. 2. Now* however? that the P.O.L. want to commence negotiations with the Sheikh concerning this area in which Hawar is situated? H.M.G. will have to give a decision as the Company will want to know before entering on negotiations whether Hawar does or does not belong to Bahrein. 3. The same remarks mutatis mutandis apply to the island of Fasht DibalU 4 . I suggest the following action:- (a) a letter to be written by me as Political Resident under instructions from H.M. u-. to tne Sheikh of Qatar? informing him that in connection uatn negotiations which certain Compc.,nioS aie Aoouc the question of the ownership of loUWar c -nd ^ c.oht must be decided. On the evidence at present available to H.M.G. these islands appear to belong t-o tib oheikh of Bahrein. H.M.G., however, have reason to believe that he, the Sheikh of Qatar, may wish to advance to these islands. If so he should suoait miese cl to H.M.G. within a certain period (say two moninW iron the date of the letter, after which no claims should be idered. (b) a letter to be sent to the Sheikh of -p the letter to the Sheikh ol ■ein enclosing a copy 0 +hlt when the the latter's reply ha r and explaining that wnc, been/been received it vould be coimnunicated to him, the Sheikh 01 Bahrein. The latter Y/ill then have an opportunity of rebutting the claim of the Sheikh of Qatar should the latter advance one. (c) a second letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein referring to letter (b) and asking him. if he would be good enoug to postpone negotiations with the Companies concerned until the ownership of Hawar and Fasht Dibal have been decided. (d) a letter to be sent to the P.C.L. and to Bapco. informing them of the action taken. 5 . The possible objection to the above line of action is that it may put ideas into the head ol the Sheikh of Qatar. However 5 I am pretty sure that hie ideas are there already and -re cannot risk the muddle that would ensue if; after the r.C.n- and .Sa.reo. nad commenced negotiations on the assumption that the islands belong to Bahrein, the Sheikh of atar were to come forward with a sound claim. Apart from this it is only fair, I think, to Aatar, to give him an opportunity of aving his say. _ 6 .

With regard to A (the Koweit beutral Zone), Mr.Longrigg said that as a result of our reiusal to allow Major Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, Major Holmes had severed his connect a on with Petroleum Concessions , Ltd. , and the Company neie afraid that he might now resume his co^necoion California Company.

The Can pan y were satisfied that there was little chance of the Sheikh of Bahrein giving them the whole of the Unallotted Area and that they had been led to believe that the Sheikh intended to give everything except the liawar Group of islands to the America,ns. For this reason they had departed from their original intention to compete for the whole of the Unallotted Area; but while they were prepared to leave the main island out of their plans, they wanted rather more than the Hawar Group and he hoped that His Majesty's Government would feel able to support the Company on the basis of tne draft concession. Sir Trenchard ?owle intervened at this stage to point out that the Company's proposed concession area included certain islands (i.e. the Hawar Group and Fasht Dibal) whose ownership as between Bahrein and n sp+prmired.

Mr.Longrigg said, however, that the Company were opposed to any postponement and he personally thought it would he a pity to put ideas of ownership into the mind of the Sneikh of Qatar. He pointed out, moreover, that if enquiries showed that the islands in question belonged to K the Sheikh of Q.atar, they would be included in the concession which tue Company had already obtained from that Ruler; and he said that by entering into negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein for them, the Company were merely running the risk of paying twice for the same thing. The Company were prepared to take this chance and would definitely prefer to carry on with the negotiations witnout gjiy postponement. Sir frenchard Towle said that he nad not appreciated the latter point and that in the circumstance he was inclined to withdraw his suggestion for postponing the negotiations .

With regard to C (the Trucial Coast, etc.), • j there were two separate poin^ , viz. Mr.Longrigg said that rnexe (1) Concessions; (2) Exploration.

A state of deadlock'had been reached and the Company felt that unless His Majesty's Government were prepared to intervene ? the only alternative open to them was to temporarily withdraw their negotiators. Asked for his views ? Sir Trenchard howle said he thought that if the Sheikhs were left alone, for say six months ? they would probably come round and accept the Company’s offers. Mr. Longrigg said, however, that in nil matters waiting usually resulted in bigger demands and he thought that delay in coming to terms might make it more difficult for the Sheikhs to withdraw from their present position. If, however, the Political Resident advised waiting, the Company would of course accept his advice, but they hoped that it would be found possible to do something to hasten matters.

He said that although ranch of the territory concerned could probably be written off as valueless ? some parts appeared to have definite interest and they must see it all. Up to the present the Company's efforts to visit certain 'interesting' areas through the medium of the Trucial Sheikhs, had been unsuccessful and the Company had formed the conclusion that it would probably be best to leave the Trucial Sheikhs alone for the time being and to try and operate through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg mentioned in this connection that he had seen the Sultan during the latter's recent visit to London and had been told that in addition to certain parts of Muscat territory, the Sultan might be able to arrange for a party to reach Baraimi (which the Sultan claimed belonged to him) through Muscat.

I am sending copies ox Yours sincerely? Sd. T.V. Brenan A c w m a. Gibson Esq. ■I ' iI ' I c } i foreign office, S. .1, S 2288 / 413 / 91 ) There are tv/o points on which I should like to say something, the first concerns the Hav/ar group of islands. The position here is as I understand it, that these islands probably belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but may conceivably belong to the Sheikh of Qatar or even to Ibn Saud. The company wish to secure the rights over these islands by this concession on the assumption that they belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. If they belong to the Sheikh of satar they have already got rights over them under their &lt;--greemenb a-i'ch Qatar and if they should turn out to belong to Ibn Baud uney realise that neither this proposed agreement nor the agreement wit Qatar will give them any rights there and that they are not getting any guarantees by H.M.G. that a claim by Ton Saud will not he recognised by them. This being the position, it seems to be to be better to word the 'Secondly m Article draft concession as follows. 'The whole of that portion of the Sheikh's dominions (leased area Ho. 2) incl ' ad S islands, reefs, shoals and waters belonging to the Sheikh , +c n The boundary within the following boundary , . n r*n—ordinates clearly limits which are defined by geographica, go round the Hawar group of islands and therefor belong to the Sherkh the concession covers them. On _ + +hpv „ re not mentioned m this way other hand, the fact tha definitely 1+ r +h ., t the concession definite^ difficulty tho.r mio nds do belong to the Sheikh 4 - + or&gt; Querns to me to Of treating the matter s-em be/ by name avoids the contains a statement that the This way of Bahrein.V Toe more appropriate in vie-;/ of the c ire Constances indicated above. Then there is the point about territorial waters which arises as I understand it in this way. The proposed concession refers to all waters within the proposed leased area* and the area includes waters outside 3 mile limit? but it cannot be intended that the oil should actually be extracted from the sea water and the intention I think must be to obtain the right to extract oil from the land under the sea within this area and this point is relevant because so far as the water is concerned not only does the Sheikh na\/e no right over v/ater outside the three mile limit but u.loO in the ordinary a/ay he cannot acquire toy occupation or prescription any sovereignty over such water. On the other hand, as regards the sea hed and the land under the ted, although the Sheikh has at present no right to suen land ouboiae the . . • + iq recognised that the hed of the sea and three mile limit? 10 is r&lt;-ou 0 ^ -r,,- iiqition bv occupation beyond the land under it is capable ox -cquisi the three mile limit. nnd indeed both pearl fisheries and Cornish tin mines which extend beyond the three mile lx,:ux . a. n +his w v. consequently? are held to have been approprxa - , , hetaer to substitute for the I should thin : that it would be be oxer s q submerged land', so that the phrase word 'waters - 1 the words oUbm g . ■PS. Shoals and submerged land oelongx g would run “islands, r e - 1 The effect of this would be fne land below the sea to the Sheikh comprised •••• o-et the right xo xx that the c ompany w o al - &amp; , ^ -n-np limit and also outside immediately within tno laaee i - . d it its toon as they had approprxaxcd the three mile limit as s ppropriation by the compa vesting it in the Sheikh from iir Sheikh. At any rate the insertion of the phrase 5, helonging to the Sheikh' gets over any difficulties from our point of view as regards territorial waters. (Sd.) 'J.E.

The position as regards the ownership of Doth these places is still indefinite, and we have not reached any conclusion on the question of recognising any particular Ruler as owner. It is true that Baraimi is claimed hy Abu Dhabi, but Hickinbotham in his letter of 15th August, 1937, (see enclosure to India Office printed letter of the 27th September, P.Z.6237/37) described the claim as too ambitious, and added ’’The Sheikh has never previously claimed more than seven villages of this oasis. The Naim who claim to be independent of Muscat and Abu Dhabi occupy some of the Baraimi villages'. Evidence of a measure of control by Abu Dhabi in Baraimi is referred to in Caroe s telegram of the 24th September, 1937, No.T/216 (enclosure to India Office printed letter of the 27th September, P. Z. 6341/37), but we are not sure what importance is to be attached to this. On the other hand the Sultan of Muscat also asserts a claim to Baraimi - see the Political Agent's Express Letter of the 13th October, 1937, (enclosure to India Office printed letter of the llth November, P. Z. 7314/37). A o l0T;le paragraph 3. C. ( 6 ) of his letter of the 13th May last • ■+- ifz’tfpv of the 24th Msy 9 (enclosure to India Office prm ^ ^ ..--• 4 - -bn Twelves to the Sultan, but P.Z. 3549/38), we need not comma ^ HiU p e appreciably strengthened if his claim to Baraimi v/ili he gets the Company into tne . ' Baggallay, Esq. ? ^ ir .. 1 Foreign Office, ■ 8 . 7 .As regards Jatal Hafit, it appears from the enclosures to Hickintotham’s letter of the 15th August ' that ATou Dnahi has claimed territory up to a line running through Jabal Hafit. There does not, however, appear to be any suggestion in recent correspondence ? e.g. in paragraph 3.c(l) of Fov/le f s letter of the 13th May, to support the presumption in Brenan’s letter of the 22 nd January (E. 19/19/91) that the Sheikhs of Jabal Hafit owe allegiance to Abu Dhabi. We do not know if the Sultan claims the place, but here again we agree we must await practical evidence of control before committing ourselves on the question of ownership. Yours ever, (Sd.) J.P.

Am I right in thinking that v/e regard Baraimi and the Jabal Hafit as pertaining to Abu Dhabi? If so have not Petroleum Concessions Limited gone a little far? While Longrigg's letter commits no one but Petroleum Concessions Limited, we suggest that in view of past experience every effort should be made to avoid indicating that the rights of Arab rulers over any given territory _ •10 rlear beyond all doubt are recognisedj unless i ° • ^ n-p-fpotive authority over that they can and do exercise effective that territory. fours ever, J.

The Sultan's plan was he told me, for the party to proceed as far as Khaburah by car whenoe they would travel by camel straight through t-o Baraimi. They would be passed on from the territory of one Sheikh to another under arrangements made by the Sultan and could be accompanied throughout their journey by toe Sultan’s own Representative Wall j&amp;udhaifar. 3 .

You will have received Fowle’s comments contained in his demi-official letter No.C/351 of the 20th June 1938 of which a copy was sent to you. The Government of India agree with these comments as stated in paragraphs 2 to 7 of his letter and with his proposals as to the procedure to be adopted regarding the Political Agreement and Draft Letter No.l. 3. Fov/le has now produced a copy of Sultan Said Taimur s letter of the 19th March 1923, which the present Sultan has quoted, but he has not commented on the effect which this letter has on the Sultan's repudiation of his father's letter has on obligations. It seems to the &lt; matter is not entirely free from clear that Sultan Taimur in 1923 It seems to the Government of India that the entirely free from difficulty, since it tan Taimur in 1923 definitely delcared that It seems to the Government of India that no agreement entered into by him wo successors, unless the agreement i d into by him would be binding upon his the agreement itself contained a mention of his successors. contained in the letter to Major Rae 1923 (Vide Aitchis. regarding oil letter to Major Rae of the 10th January no mention of his Sultan's argument that , in view of view of his father's letter, to oil did not descend to him »s letter. the undertaking with regard to oil of 10th February 1932. not covered by his own letter and was HisHis Majesty's Government can presumably reply that the Political Re-xdent of the time declined to accept Sultan l? Taimu' s letter, and conveyed a personal message to the oultan through the Political Agent, Muscat that is would be mostiinadvisable in the Sultan's own interest for any general sucn/aeciaration as His Highness proposed to be forwarded to Government* The Sultan did not protest or insist upon his declaration being forwarded and since neither the Government nor His Majesty’s Government were informed of the letter, they do not consider themselves bound by its terms* The validity of such a rejoinder is perhaps open to doubt* but it appears from your letter P.Z.2210/38 of the 19th May 1938 that His Highness the Sultan is actuated rather by motives of prestige than by any desire to embarrass Government and if his ’’amour propre” is satisfied bv the procedure now suggested by Fowle, it is perhaps unnecessary to pursue the question further in connection with the undertaking of 1923 regarding oil* I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowle.

FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to lie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf.

The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement,( 2 ) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan, south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. 11. The ( sian Oil Co on the 5 th Ibis was Iran of Pe sur d&lt; 12. Cons am 4e limits of il indicated lit admit] le south o ard as the Koweit Neutral Zone. 6 . The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair Conference of November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived M between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession in the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit, to whom application has been made, refuses to grant an option in respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when I bn baud dies. Petroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed b} the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is now thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position m respect of Ibn Saud s rights in the zone much the same as that which they receive m regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 24r-28 below).

Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein but not allotted to the Bahrein Petroleum Companf in their lease have been earned on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without . definite result. i i T ^T Bah ^ ein Petrol( r™ Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929, the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oil Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abn Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Sand claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty’s Government do not admit Ibn Sand’s claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914.

It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahrein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a port on the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied by the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of Nejd .—The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa area concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “ secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind of an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25. Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933, the Saudi Arabian Government and the company agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the 27th May (referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi tion of two extra articles, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been inserted in their appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriately renumbered, and a revised version of the (renumbered) article 35. 26. The effect inter alia of these additional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of California a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern baudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area (i.e., the Hasa concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations.” 4is country l lilted with I 31.

The effect of these preference rights in (a) is to entitle the h company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered 1 to the Saudi Arabian Government by another company. If the Standard Oil Company of California elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi Arabian Government is free to accept the other company’s offer. Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California’s preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. to the Stai Ml 1| Yemen. n btanWj 2 9 No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the attitude of the Imam Yahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign )n ' interests The French interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how- :essionMt! evei . been SUCC essful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the Yemen for a period of six months. if Saudi M jabia. auli if i boundary I me iment of i a or he ti: il ia some ermueni^i sig m { ivel rre icial the ad r? oil ther Unseat and Oman. , 30.

FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to lie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf.

The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement^ 2 ) \ dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan, south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. Koweit Neutral Zone. 6. The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair Conference of November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived M between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession in the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit, to whom application has been made, refuses to grant an option in respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when Ibn Saud dies. Petroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed b) the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is now thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position m respect of Ibn Sand s rights in the zone much the same as that which they received m regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 24-28 below).

The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929 the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard' Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oil Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a terinof seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited)''(the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud claims a frontier which m effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty s Gove—f do not admit Ibn Saud’s claim, but have offered him a fronuer w -h -h ie lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914.

The concession runs for a period of sixty years. The area of the concession as set out in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows :— “All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.” 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company and some oil has been found. It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahrein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a port on the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied by the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of Nejd.—The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa area concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind of an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25.

On the same date as the conclusion of this modified agreement letters T/ere exchanged by the company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the company’s preference rights in regard to (a) “the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia” referred to m paragraph 26 above, and (b) the Koweit Neutral Zone (see paragraph 7 above). The effect of these preference rights in (a) is to entitle the company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi Arabian Government by another company.

Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California’s preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. The Yemen. 29. No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the attitude of the Imam Yahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign interests. The Trench interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how ever, been successful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the Yemen for a period of six months.

My dear Watts, Many thanks for your letter C.114 dated August 7th which reached me two days ago. I hope you will find it possible to finance the party at Muscat as suggested. We are now in process of appointing Mohammed Nasib &amp; Company as our agents provisionally and they would normally provide us with funds, but the possibility of needing to draw on another source in addition cannot be ignored. It is very satisfactory that the Sultan has no objection to Hassan Mohammed Ja'afar.

Their equip^ will have preceded them ana tney wi i- . almost immediately. Could you tell me anything about testate of th^ unfurnished house to which ______ occupation, even for is reasonably suitable!or ■u P wor th our while to take a few days, it would probably be wort^ ^ vejyklndly it over and have it cleanea up i note your own very let me have a word about tni . u be extremely kind offer of hospitality,ol wmcn glad to avail myself. I. !2 - We can no doubt pay something for the use of R.A.F. Aerodromes: but I cannot help hoping that this does not represent the Sultan T s attitude to our activities in generalI It seems that we must leave the Baraimi landing ground question until our people reach the spot; apparently the Sultan has not actually sent anyone to the spot to see what can be done. Our people, who were there 18 months ago, think there is every possibility of finding a landing ground not far off, although there is also a wide extent of broken ground. I do not know at the moment (and the India Office cannot tell me) your exact whereabouts, whether Muscat or somewhere in India.. For safety I am sending this to Muscat.

As regards his penultimate paragraph, he suggests that after Baraimi the party should return to the Batinah coast at Sohar, thus keeping within his territories. Actually, it will probably suit our plans better for the par up to pass out of his territories to the North.

If we come to appoint a permanent agent in Muscat we will, of course, give every weight to the Sultan’s wishes. If our operations (in so far as concerns Muscat itself, or our relations with the Ruler) assume any importance, we shall no doubt have a European representative, as is indeed encumbent upon us under our Political Agreement with H.M.G. At the moment the chief task is the distribution of aviation petrol and oil to the various landing grounds on the south coast which we expect to use. As Mohammid bin Nassib &amp; Co. are agents for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. (who supply the petrol etc.) and, I believe, for the R.A.F., it is more or less inevitable that they should act for us in this capacity, and are actually doing so under arrangements already made. Certain stores and equipment for the use of our geological party have already been consigned to us at Muscat, c/o Mohammid bin Nassib. That is the extent to which, so far, they have become our agents. The expedition, after once having left »useat, nil be based much more upon Sharjah, and I do not ;hink that any agency of ours in Muscat itself will Lave any importance. re i certainly a sad blow that you will not be . ^ i- will there. I wonder, be any cnaiioe ux SrtL/iitn « Karachi cr .1 Gradcrl I hat.to think that by arriving at Muscat in your absence I shall be something of a nuisance, but do not see how it can be avoided and shall be most grateful for any help. Is there anybody (native of Muscat) whom you could recommend as personal clerk, factotum or orderly? I think I will leave over the subject of the Sultan T s house until I arrive. The geologists will have complete camp and kitchen equipment with them and could, therefore occupy it, unfurnished. There will be plenty of time for me to have it cleaned up before they arrive. I am leaving Marseilles by the Narkunda on October 1st, arriving Bombay on the l^th.

I have unexpectedly returned to Muscat due to the crisis 9 and will be here to meet you and fix up everything for you before I go to Gwadur. I my have to leave two or three days after your arrival (though I hear there is a chance that I may have to accompany your party as far as Baraimi) but I shall be able, I hope, to give you all the assistance you require before I do go.
