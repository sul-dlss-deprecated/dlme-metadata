By a coincidence I had discussed this question of Daly with Barrett while I was in ingland anu had expressed icy disapproval of these taethods, pointing out that the good i)oiitical officer obtained the neccssaiy in- •fluence but appeared as little as was possible or only to the extent that was essential to show he was there. On my arrival here Barrett wrote to me referring to this conversation and said he had been working on the lines I had suggested, and on r^y recent visit told me the situation was oonsiaeYably better.

Conditions have been baa but nevertheless soiuewhat exaggerated by the connection of different events which had no political connection with each other though the initial cause of each may have been and probably was the »ame. 1 feel it is too early for me to write official reports on the subject so I send this short note demi-official- •ly. I shall spend a fortnight at Bahrain as soon as 1 can and will make a detailed report on the situation. One thing that is certain is the blitical Agent is too much in his court trying petty cases in 50 ^er cent of which 10 rupees to 50 rupees are involved. He cannot get out and keep touch and even has to refuse visits. his, as you know, is a very bad system amongst Arabs. A Hative assistant has always been allowed and is a primary necessity that the Political Agent can do the work for which he is sent to Bahrain instead of acting as a I am asking for this immediately, so 1 cause court.go: FIDT ?r:iAL .

BAKH4XH KK *CHlin. mmm mmmmtrnmmmmum*** sir. I have the honour to utate that on my recent visit to Bahrain I found things oonuiderably improved. Shaikh laa was on better terms with his son Hamad, who has a considerable respect for his father and has a great desire to stand well with hin. Shaikh lea now draws his pension - indeed he is asking for more. He called on me, and instead of maintaining a taciturn aloofness, talked freely, ana on my return call volunteered information of his own accord. He has steadily improved in his relations with the 'olitical Agent. On uy first visit to Bahrain in the beginning of February I found things had already improved, but a i &gt;osuible cause of trouble existing in the bad relations between Shaikh Hamad and the Bhia Qasi, Shaikh Khallaf. I explained to the latter that it was obvious he could not continue in the place if he and the de facto shaikh of the Islands were at loggerheads, and later both he and Shaikh Hamad stated that as far as they were concerned they were on the best of terms, Shaikh Hamad pretending that the onl&gt; cause of ^ ^ trouble was the dislike of the l.hias for their Qazi, who was dishonest.In actual fact they were eaoii auspiciouu of the other and ready to take up any quarrel or intrigue against the other. un my arrival on ay second visit the : haikh expressed a desire to see me about two matters. he xirst was the Bowasir tribe affair, on which I have reported ueparateiy, the second, Hhaikh itfiallaf. He produced a petition, with apparently hundreds of signatures, in which the l-hia comrounity protested against the rapacity and injustice of their r^aai and requested that a second ^a£i, whom they named, should also have cases referred to him. Shaikh Hamad again suggested that he himself was on the best of terms with Shaikh Khallaf but there was no doubt that there was much feeling against him, and hft asked me to get Shaikh Khallaf removed. Shaikh Khallaf was one of the biggest supporters of Major Daly, and thus while r&gt;haikh Hamad desired me to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him by getting rid of the jizl, my doing so would give colour to a theory which lias been suggest •ed in places that whatever Major Daly did was wrong and that it is a safe game to play to go against his supporters. Any such suggestion both the olitical Agent una I were anxious to negative. Accordingly I sent for 'haikh Khallaf anu told him that he must get on good terms with r&gt;haiiCh Hamad and that until circumstances were better I would strongly advisS him to go on a pilgrimage himself. . i£aJor Barrett had told me that do without haikh Khallaf, confident that rhaikh Hamad could not him, had once stated to him as one of the solutions of the situation that he would go on a pilgrimage to Kerbala. I recalled this statement to him and suggested it was the best thing he could do, at the same time maintaining good relations with Shaikh Hamad. He finally agreed to do this and I again saw r&gt;haikh Hamad, told him of the solution anc ins true tedinntruoteci hira to onow shaikh iJiallaf special honour and friend-* •ohly until he left. o thia he agreed. It ic now dcterzziined thftt after amasan l^haiich KhaXlaf will leave of his own accord and in all honour* and will stop |\ awoy Bome time. I trust that this will remove all cause of friction. Shaikh Khaliaf is bound to intrigue but Major Barrett does not now anticipate that his following is so great us to causi trouble. he (si is a man of character but is now getting old. Of his venality there is, I fear, little doubt, and it is not the first time he has had to leave for similar reasons. His successor is reported to be a religious man who takes little money. 1 ara, I fear, sceptical regarding the honesty of Shia mullahs as I have yet to meet an honest one, but he appears to be good of his kind though somewhat fanatical, anu to respect the property of widows and orphans. He is at any rate the choice of his sect. A complication lias been that the Agency Interpreter was the son~in*»law of the Qasi, an undesirable state of affairs, ''rem the time that Bhaikh Hamad was known to be in opposition to his father-in-law, open complaints of bribe-taking have been brought against our Interpreter. Regarding these I will not at present express an opinion 9 but numerous persons have come forward to prove sums given by them and thtir friends or taken by the Interpreter as comzaission, sums amounting probably to some lakhs of rupees over the past few years. Kis pay is H. l&amp;0/~ per mensem. I had already appointed a new man temporarily ana the matter is under investigation. Things in general are however considerably better, i^ajor Barrett sees no immediate reason to anticipate any further serious trouble, and x'rom my enquiries I endorse his opinion. hati J I I I ■ ■ ■ ■■■, I ww^i'M TO'tiweliiiiHBWHH^^M ■ ■ 11 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■k ■ II - : ... ■' hat dirficuitiee itilX occur, that the aituation will continue to need careful handling by the 'olitical V^ent ia certain, but the intriguea in the n&amp;me of Shaikh ^aa ana perhaps thoce of Chaiich Abdulla, Shaikh Mainad , » brother, appear to e&gt;i»t no longer.

Shaikh Hnmad is desirous of instituting a suhsidiary Olvll Court oompetent to deal with olvll oases in wh^oh the amount involved is not more than Rs. 50/-. A court of this description existed previously In IImama and lately several leading merchants and not^hles have suggested that it should 'be revived. At present owing to the amount of oases which are brought Into the Bahrain Oourt, parties often h^.ve to wait for several weeks before the first hearing of their cases, frequently one of the parties leaves Bahrain in the meantime. It is thought that the proposed court, sitting three times a week, will 'be able to deal nromotly with the innunerable small cases, often involving only a few rupees, bet veen petty shopkeepers and their custor.srs which at present occupy so much of the time of the Bahrain Oourt• Shaikh Hamad considers that the useful ess coirt would be much increasoi If it had jurisdiction protected as well as Bahrain sublets. This oeuli V# effected if the court included a jpret****! m preferably, % raab^r of th# Cupage -2- tfrfnpf question he reouests your approval. As at present proposed the Court v /lll consist of Captain K. L, Parke, assistant adviser, and another nenher to he appointed hy Shaikh Hamad, probably one of the lesser Shaikhs of tho Ruling family. Personally I strongly advooate the suggestion, The Bahrain Court, whloh consists of myself and Shaikh Salman, Shaikh Hamad T s eldest son, three^ and sometimes four^times a week from about 8 a.m. until 2 p.m., taking on an average 35 - 30 oases each day. In spite of this a formliable number of pending cases accumulate. The result Is that only two mornings in the week remain which I aan devote to other work. This is not sufficient. I venture to state that my duties here are not supposed to consist mainly of court work, but that the court work should be subsidiary to the other work. Also during this summer while the Director of Customs is on leave, I shall need time to sunervlse the Customs. approval and that you will find It possible to sanction It I hope fchat this proposal v /ill meet with your I have the honour to be.

A e I am not certain whether Major Barrett has put all of my letters on the flle--he may have regarded some of them ae private--! write to you aerai-officially to let you kr.ow how you shoulo guide your general outlook in aealing with Bahrain Questions. The main point to note is that the Shaikh has been too much suppreeseu. It is essential, if he Is to be Shaikh, that he p^houla be fully in evioence as such. As far as possible you shoula let him act An his own, merely advising him of the best thing to do. If he is obviously going wrong, use your influ ence, ana if necessary call on ne, but your object shoulo be to show him as the ruler of Bahrain. The impreseion that he is a figurehead, anu that we rule, hurts us among the Arabs on the mainland and makes them afraid of us. As I wrote to Major Barrett once, the good Political Officer acts by influence ana is seen but not heard--like the London Policeman, his greatest point Is that he is there. A v/eak P.A. lets them forget that lie is there, a too strong P.A. causes oiscontent; the true position is friendship with firmness when necessary.

In February, 1906, the legation infoimea the Persian Government that they maintained the British right to exercise good offices on behalf of Bahrainis and declared the Persian claim to be entirely inadnissable. They stated tiiat the islanc was uncer British protection and that the Ottoman Govern ment who had on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrain had invariably received this reply # On this the Grand Vizier again raif ec. the question and referred to Captain Bruce* s ©.greement of j --reply it was pointed out that the agreement in Ques icnj so far f**m having been ratified, hao been expressly repudiatec by the British Government, and that the Shah hac also withheld his approval, and had censured the Prince Governor of Shiraz for ertering into such an agreement without his authority# • Thus, though both Turkey and Persia had been informed by the British Government that Bahrain was under British protection, neither ol them had up to 1914, when war broke out, waived their claims to that place#, 56. In 1310 the Political Agent r Bahrain repotted that two Persian merchants were issuing passes for travel to Persian subjects in Bahrain, while the Persian officals In Persian ports were taking 3s 100 security from Persian travellers to ensure that their passports on return were vised by Abdul iifabi Kazeruni f a Persian merchant residing at Manameh f the capital of Bahrain. The matter was reported to Tehran, but the Foreign office decided that it was undesirable to raise the question by a protest to Tehran, 59* Presumably the cuetom continued until 1913, for in that year the Political Agent again reported the incident, but brought successful pressure to bear on the merchant to make him discontinue this practise.

No. 297-3. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 1st September 1927. My dear Bray, I remember that two years ago you warned me against writing long despatches, saying that no one had time to read them. I am offending today, twice and badly. But when you have to take the history of 150 years how can it be avoid- -ed, especially when one despatch deals with so important a matter as the -Persian claims to ^ahrain. The other, on our growth of interest in the internal affairs of the islands equally demands historical analysis. I think the subject sufficiently vital to our Eastern world politics to be its own apology. If further apology is needed it lies in the fact that it represents 6 weeks* work on my part and 3 weeks' work on Barrett 1 s and our combined notes cover 117 pages of fool- -scap. I will deal with the effect of our position at Bahrain on local Arab Shaikhs in my final survey of our position in the Persian Gulf. This will be a short despatch and will follow by next mail.

Twln^ to the soandalous condition of walcfs In Bahrain the Govornment considered It necessary to ta'ke stens on the subject. Previously, during the time Df Major 'Daly, attemnts had been made to nlace wakfs private as well as public, under the direct control of the Government. Thl3 was unpopular and after Major Daly's departure the wakfs vhlch had \ieon taken over were handed bao' 1 : to the T 'utawallls. The condition of mosques Is notorious. Mosques which are actually rich are kept inpage -2- In a ruinous and filthy aondltion, l uoh garden and Fiarlcet property has laeen deilcmtod In the past to schools. T&gt;ie schools do not exist. In most cases the wakf Incomes are appropriated by the rutawallls, the worst offenders In this respect 'being the old Sunnl Qaadl, Shaikh Qasln Bin Kehza and his numerous sons and nephews, who occupy, 'but do not function In, many paid positions In nos^ues and non-exlstont schools. These facts were so well known that foreign news-papers, Egyptian and Iranian, commented on the subject. To remedy the conditions the Government appolnte ; three new Qaadla as a Shara Court and Wakf Department. The Qaadls were nrovldel with suitable staff and accomodation, tw) clerks, and a Uathr or Inspector, Shaikh Mohomei Bin Rashld A1 Khalifa, formerly a Ka^lstrate on the Bahrain 3ourt. public were ordered to nroduce all wakf documents. This they did. The Qaadls were asked to record the documents by h^vln^ copies made, and to inspect them and to enquire into the condition and accounts of the various wakfs. They wore authorised to remove any mutawalllti ;h ^se wor.. was not satisfactory and to start a resistor and simple aooounta all of whlrt wss carefully oxplnlnofl to them and their stafi.page -3- After about two months It bcoarno perfootly olear that though provided with n oompctont olork and assistants they were absolutely Inoapable of running a denartincnt, keeping a register or aoiounts. They allowed nothing to bo written without being eTaralned by eaoh of thera in turn, a lengthy proceeding, and usually only Dne or two of the Qaadls attended the ofCloe. They effected no changes or Improvements except the removal of one notorious Mutawalll, who vas petitioned against, by the public. Public persons of standing cDmplalned to the Government of the uselessness anl Inef ficiency of the department - vhl3h Inoldentally cost a large amount of money to 'keep up. 'hey rightly pointed out that except for copying out Rbout me hundred documents nothing had been done, nor did It seem In tiho 1 ast lively that anything would be done In the future unless things were altered. After due consideration Shaikh Hamad called a meeting of fifty of the leading religious and civil notables, and tie o il »- members of his own family. A speech was read from Shallth Hamad in whloh ho In.ld do-ra new propose.!. He auggestcd that there should he n 'Dcpartraent of ISduontlon and Wakfs' under thePage -4- the direction of n O outio II with Shai&gt;h Abdul la Bin Is^ as president• The proposal was reoeivol with unanimous and genuine apnroval. The three Qaadis were Informed of the arrangement and suitable oersons vore appointed as raerahers of the Oounoil. The Qaadis vere told thnt they w^rtl 7 have the ohiof sr.y in ques tions of a religious nature, but that the wor-c of supervision of property, repairs of buildinsa and aojounts would be dealt with by the 0oun3il, who were laymen and more eTperienoed in suoh matters• All the three Qaadis appearel at the first meeting and their attitude indioatod considerable disapproval of the new regime. They emphasasised the faot that being Qendls, the chief erpononts 3f religion in Bahrain, any decision or opinion theirs should be treated as absolutely definite. They also drew attention to the fact that on their appointment they were told that in future the control of wakfs would be in their hands, some discussion they seemed to acnuiese in the change. Shaikh Abdulla has sent for an 'K'i3i-il from the Ministry of Wakfs in Baghdad ^ho -7111 bo acnuaintec 1 with the system on which the department is worked in Iraq.papre -5- The Department \3 intenlefl to deal with both 3hla anci Sunnl Wakfs.

In my opinion the ohftnge wfts absolutely neoessary If the Department was to bo of any real use. The Qaadls had an opportunity of effecting great Improvoments, they were given every faalllty and the strongest supp^t, but they did nothing. The new system has the entire approval of the lay population, the only opnosltlon helng from a few Kuta-.vallla and religious persons who naturaly resent any scrutiny Into their aooounts -na their atolnio- tratlon.

Sir # Your O^e^ient Servant, Flnanolal Aflvlser to the Government, Bahrain.Munanmepali, 6th November 1927. I,.y dear ^aworth. I erclos^/rough note giving in potted form tiB impressions 1 got on rrv visit to Bahrein. i should be vevy glad if you would discuss with Barrett when you c/~ return to Bali re in and let im have your cornrents on -Hmn as soon as you can thereafter* ^(101 that I am conscious of running counter to your views; on the contrary, much of what I have written is derived directly from our conversations. But I am anxious to feel that there is nothing in wliat I have written which might embarrass you were it embodied in an official answer to your Despatch, x'his I will hold up until I get a reply. I mil also hold up our conments about the Dowasir until I heaa the result of your further conversation on the subject with Barrett and Bel grave. I think we are lucky in having a man ofBaLgrave^s tact at Bahrein. A man witiiout tact in iiis position nii^it do a lot of harm hov&gt;/ever great his capacity otherwise. I hope we shall he able to keep Barrett for l8 months or so in Bahrein, for he seens to me to he just the sort of man we require to ^ive matters A their slightly different turn. The Hon'ble Lt.Gol. B.H. Ifeworth, Political Liecident in the Persian Gulf, Budiire.Bahrein ons olDViously 'be coma tiie keystone of our position in tiie Gulf. It is likely to gain rather than lose importance in this respect quite apart from its commanding position on any air route alor^ the Arab littoral It is untlinkable that we should abdicate from our position as the paramount protecting power. 2. -The local arguuents in favour of an open and definite declaration that Bahrein is a British protectorate are strong. 5 # If, however, wider policy does not peniit of such a declaration our position is impregnable anyhow. It is based on Treaties which are at once adequate a 7 id puolic. They give us our essentials — the control of foreign affairs and of foreigners. From these essentials flow inevitably certain rigits and indeed duties to intenere in internal affairs. Our /Jnfinference goes doubtless beyond what flows inevitably fraa our Treaties. But no Treaty could adequately cover it unless it were a Treaty extinguishing the Sfeeilih's sovereignty to a degree less than that possessed by ar^Indian Chief. 4. One of the great difficulties in the problem is the fact that the reforms we have introduced and the development sclieoas we loave initiated are very fine performances in themselves and of great benefit toBarrain. It is unthinkable that we should undo our fine wodi. Nevertheless it is agreed on all l]ands / new tliat v/e mve taken stock of tii4 situation,tiiat rxEtters should he given a somewhat different turn or the Arab facade will fall ard we slBll be left with a British island pure and simple. 5. The re suit would be - (a.) a needless addition to our coirraitments; (bj an actual loss of power for through the Sheikh we can do inuch ( e.g. keep Gennans out^ J wiiich we could not do on our ov/n; and (c) we should ooj«r'ffi? an awful warning to -ttessp Arab Sheikhs of the consequences of admitting British interference ,and help to set up Bin Gaad in 'their eyes as 'the one/uianpion ot Arab a^iinst British encroachments. 6, Our aim should 'be not British efficiency,for ^ lT ■ with this /ur goal we could stop no eap hut ^demonstrate that an Arab State can advance on Western lines under British protection and yet/its Arab CiB .racter. Hence we must endeavour to tal^e out the British high-lightj from the picture and bring the Arab rule of the Sheikh more into the for aground. 8. British interference is lu irmiiHi^ over 'advertised in the police, a particularly fine of rue^all Punjabi Ivluliaianadans witn uniform and drill of an Indian regiment. Tiiey suggest at once foreign role j and toake it look as if the present state of Balirein depends for its security on Indian bayonets, (k striking t . t 4 contrast is afforded by the appearance of the A.P.O.G, Persian policemen in the British Settlement at Khali In this^ as in all matters, we should cling to essentials and discard the trimnings. We might for instance, drop the unifotm or at any nate simplify it; replace some of the Punjahis gradually 'by some elenent less foreign^.g. Arabs from the Yemen)keeping a diminishing nurnber of -^^scR^^a nucleus. 9, We should aim at cutting dovai the three British administrators gradually to one, Lie policei.an I should probably be the first to go^ to be followed in course of time by the Gustor® Superintendent. But if llr Belgrave is eventually to control police anu custons he must of course be given subordinates ( possibly Arab or Egyptian ) to help him and he must be relieved also of some of his present executive work. belief night perhaps be given at once in judicial matters. If he can't be relieved of judicial wtk altogether his work migit be confined either to big cases or appellate wrk. Speakinggenerally the British administrator's \voik should tend to 'becoirB more and more advisory and supervisory^ &gt;^s aim —b^jafto 'bring the Arab rule of the Shellch more and more A into the foreground. It is no doubt very difficult to make the amiable Haratd rule, but it is better that he should rule and make mistakes than we should rule and make no i T mistakes at all. jlxperience apparently shavs tlBt the more power within reason that is given to the far more energetic TiAo and influensg^rf Abdulla the straightsr he l runs and the smoother the administration. If it is at all f ! in consonance with Arab ways it would seem viorth while to ; give a trial to a council with HacAd as President,and/Mr Belgrade and a third Arab as KEmbers. This might tend to instil some resolution into HanAd's rule and at the same time give abdulla a mre definite participation in it. ( 6 - n 7 -1927. Lluliarmierah#C7« A r A .

My dear Bray, Many thanks for your D.O. of 6th November, forwarding a note or your impressions of Bahrain. On my return I discussed the matter both with Barrett and with Be^grage. I have no critieism to make on your note as showing what would be most desirable -- in practice we shall have difficulties but that does not matter as long as the spirit is maintained, since practice usually falls short of the ideal. The stumbling block is that, left to themselves, the Arab Shaikhs wouli still return to their old wajs, thus the p.A. will always have to maintain his influence In one matter we have already relieved pressure. The local panchayat used to be nominated harf by the Shaikh half by the ?,A. This caused friction in 192o. I have now ruled, and Barrett agrees, that the Shaikh shall nominate all members, subject tevfehe p.A. f s veto, which would rarely be fexercised, probably never with a P.A. who maintained goo I relatioi - and I trust we shall not have one who does not v Belgrave considers he could work best with the Customs Off icq 0 gone first and we have already warned de G-renier that his servic »will be dispensed with ina years time. The Persian' claim to Bahrain will delay matters in any case and I am waiting for a copy of Lor d Clardenon's letter before I put up my final views.

'ith reference to iiir Frederick Johnston t s letter L ! o*5-!i&gt; *t» dated the 19th January 1929, i am directed to say that the introduction of reforms in .Bahrain was originally intended only to remove the worst features of Arab misrule. As matters stand noz/j however, it would seem that the process has overrun its original limited objective. There are in -Bahrain to-day a British Financial Adviser, a British Police Officer, and a British Customs Officer; that is, actually more .British administration than in an ordinary Indian atate, even than (for instance J in Kalat, though Kalat is a frontier atate, in which imperial considerations dictate a comparatively marked degree of direct interference• 2. There is an evident danger that with this example before their eyes the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of ibn baud, as the greatest Arabian figure# Their fear of Wahabi absorption may be less than their fear of losing their local and Arab individuality in exchange for an uncongenial western regime, however efficient / and profitable that regime may be* 3* i am to request you to examine in this light the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a view to deciding how far it is possible and expedient now to retrace the steps which have been taken; and to submit your concrete proposals for the initiation of a revised policy* l have the honour to be, yir ?

From Captain C.G.Prior, I.A Political Agent, Bahrein To The Secretary to the Hoa'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. ft* Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No. I98-S dated the 5th June 1929, forwarding letter No. F-I64-N/29 dated the 28/5/29 from the Government of India, asking for my considered opinion as to how far it is possible to retrace the steps taken since the ksjc reforms commenced, and to submit the following report. 2. For convenience these steps have been termed the*reforms! but as words that mean one thing in the Persian Gulf have anothei 2000 miles away, I will first of all sumr-arise the events that led up to them, then describe exactly what reforms were intended^ how far they have been carried out, and how far it is practical or politic rbo go back on them, such a retrogression being consi dered in the light* of its reaction upon petty Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf. 3. In I9o4 ; as the result of an outrage on Messrs Wonckhaus followed by an attack on Persians, strong action was taken by the Political Resident, and Major Cox, as he then was, warned the Shaikh with the authority of the Government of India that further neglect of his advice would not be tolerated by the Bri tish Government. This consolidated our position in Bahrein and improvement in trade resulted, but the situation remained unsat- is factory, % and remedies were mooted. His Majesty^ Government decided however ' to pursue a cautious policy ' 4. In I$09, •' Amelioration was to be sought by indirect andPage 2. and pacific means, through an increase of influence with the Shaikh M and in this year the Shaikh ( Isa ) ceded jurisdiction over foreigners. In 1912 the Shaikh successfully defied the Agency over the question of the lidding Company, which had in volved British subjects in losses of over 50,000/- and insisted on corresponding the Turkish Wali in Basra in defiance of his treaty provisions. Punishment 'by mutilation was again resorted to, and in 1913 a fight of Basrawis occurred. 5. In the war years the situation remained thoroughly bad, but Government were preoccupied elsewhere, and as the Shaikh's attitude was loyal, nothing was done. Also,as in the year 1916 there were no less than five separate Political Agents, one a clerk and another an invalid,it is not surprising the al Khalifa got out of hand. In 1919 Shaikh Abdullah returned from present ing his four points to the Secretary of State, returning f demorj i alised by his vist to Paris and its debaucheries * and a reign of terrorism and oppression for Bahama comiuences. Hamad is the ostensible agenfof his father but Abdullah becomes the real forc&lt; Reforms are considered but the Old Shaiish, Aodullah and the 'Q^ueen 1 block everything. The * Q.ueen'holds courts, punishes at will and banks or buries 500/- of State funds perdiem. List of 22 crimes committed by Abdullah sent to Govt. 6. Events now move quickly. The first Sitrah outrage. Town fired on nightly. Policeman murdered behind Agency on 1/2/22. Govt, not prepared to act 1 until they are satisfied all local resouces are exhausted * . Demonstration of Eaharna, Isa gets cold feet, Abdullah frightened and retires. In July 22 Foreign Office point out that persecution of Shiahs will have unfavourable repercussion on Persia. Bin Saud's agent gives trouble. As result of Govt views, P.R. drops idea of reforms. v ^ ' Attack on Barbar. Isa continues th thwart Kamad at every turn. Govt, determine to take action. Col Knox considers ( No. 421 of 9/5/23 ) action premature and unnecessary. Next day, Nejdi- Persian riots take place, followed by attack of Dowasir in day light on ♦Ali. Shaikh Isa deposed. Dowasir lightly dealtPage 3. with, and murder Shiah Alim and companion near Budaiyya in revenge. In Jan 1924 second Sitrah outrage, in revenge for evi dence given in former case, strong action taken and reforms com mence. Govt ♦ have no desire to proceed faster than they can ts. 4. take the Shaikh wholheartedly with them. A1 Ghattam murders, t small ourages and finally attack on Shaikh^ life in 1926. Levy Corps had been disbanded owing to incidents and Indians enlisted to Replace them. Mr Belgrave arrives and reforms begin to get under weigh. Gapt. Parke arrives, and from end of 1927 no further acts of violence take place. This brief summary shows quite clearly that Government's policy of non-interference became untenable, and finally they were obliged to act with decision and vigour. 7. I will now consider what reforms x were contemplated. It appears from the letter forwarded with Residency letter to Govt under no.307/S of 15/6/23 the principal reforms contemplatec A were, reform of finances, including the civil list. Customs, Govt, offices and a survey. As at a result of the second Sitrah outrage a Levy Corps was formed, to be disbanded later and Pun jabi Musalmans being subsituted for the Muscati Baluchis. Pearling reforms were also contemplated tho* I cannot trace any proposals made to Govt, concerning this. Proposals were made for a judicial assistant to the Political Agent, to be paid for by the State, but this idea was apparently dropped, and fi nally Mr Belgrave was engaged ad Financial Adviser. Mr de Gren- ier had already been engaged to reorganise the Customs after Mr Bower. 8. The reforms that were actually effected are, A. a Financial Adviser controlling all expenditure and doing bis best to limit a too buoyant Civil List. B. A reorganised Customs department, 'ith which is combined Boat registration, collection of Pedaling licences. Passport and Port Officer's duties, i C. A reformed Court consisting of the Adviser and Shaikhs apparent, and a lower court composed of the Adst Adviser/ • s Page 4. and another al Khalifa. D. Diving reforms. A properly constituted Court, supervision of nakhuda^ 'books, and an account 'book for each diver. E. Land Department. A survey has almost 'been completed and when finished surveyors will be reduced. F. Police under a British Commandant, and no longer under mianicipality. They consist of roughly 100 Indian armed police, and a local force of uniformed constables, mostly Persians, and a force of naturs or night watchmen. u G. Public Works. Sea Road bilt, artesian wells sunk, elec- * / ^ric light about to be installed. H. Education. One girls school and 'fmrr boy f s schools. I. Waqfs. Shiah Wa(^s removed from ^adhis by populat desire ^ Bahrain and placed in charge of laymen. An attempt by K Govt to do this in 1926 created a riot, but it has now come about by the action of the Shaih's themselves. J. Municipalities. The Manama municipality has made great strides and the newly created Muharraq municipality has made v ;onderful progress. 9. It should be here stated that Bahrein has undergone a marked change in the six years that have followed Shaikh Isa^ deposition. The public are far more enlightened kjh A ( it is common to hear mainland Arabs referred to as savages!) prosper ity has increased, and land values have trebxled. The Bahama have had security and justice for the first time for 150 years and have come to think of their rihgts. Divers serfage has been auch ameliorated and there is little or no opposition to Govern ment J s activities and crimes of violence have almost ceased. The Per sians show,however, an increasingly truculent national spirit, and the Nejdis and Hasawis are as vociferous as before. Instead of resisting reforms, the public spirit now demands them, and an instance of this is the way in v /hich the Shiahs have mnder taken the charge of their waqfs* More schools, technical edu cation, medical help and midwives, large public works ( e.g. the -Manama- Muharraq causeway and bridge ) are demanded, and the elec-/: Page 5• trie light installation is eagerly looked forward to. Best of all our detractors are silent and Bahrein is no longer a news item in the Arab press. 10. I will now consider how far it is possible to go 'back on these changes. As regari^i A, I consider that it will be im possible to dispense with Mr Belgrave. The fons et origo of our trouble in Bahrein is that the Government of India interfered with the course of nature in protecting first Shaikh Isa and then ilacing him with Shaikh Hamad. In a really free Arab State, Abdullah would have killed ot disposed of these two long ago, and made himself an absolute ruler. Shaikh Hamad does not owe his position to him self, and is amiable and weak, and though successive P .A.s are instructed to allow him to stand on his own feet and act for him self, unless he were to be reborn, he will always lean on the P.A. and if he fails him, do nothing. I can heartily sympathise with hira r for in his dislike of bother and in his afiection for a coun try life and shooting his tastes exactly con^icide with my own. He dislikes and despises the Bahama who form the bulk of his subjects, and so long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem after lunch, get shooting and hawking and enough money to sup port him he does not mind what happens to Bahrein, though he has no objection to a little pomp and pride of place. It is ob vious that such a man must have an efficient adviser if he is to keep his head above water in these troublous times. II. ShaiKh Abdullah, the only al Khalifa of any aoility, unusual . _ f , , apart from a record of profligacy ( he is credited with a bag A of 500 virgins ) has a redord of crime almost unequalled in any Arab State, and it was only fear that made him cease his efforts to undermine Shaikh Hamad and policy that made him cooperate with the reforms. He is in minniiiwwt touch with Bin Saud, tho* ^ outwardly his conduct is irreproachable. Shaikh Salman, Shaikh Hamad * s heir, is quite unsophisticated and not far removed frOiH a Bedouin but not devoid of promise, and apart from these the adult al Khalifa are nonentities, incapable or vicious or all three. The Shaikh^ responsible minister would have to oe anPage 6. an al Khalifa, and I do not know of on^- who has the training or the qualifications for the task. It has to be remembered thtt the projects like the electric light, and judicial work involve a knowledge far beyond the grasp of the al Khalifa, who are far worse educated than most merchants in the town. I see no alternative to Mr Belgrave at present, and if we want one he must be trained for the work. The most hopeful son that Shaikh Hamad has who is not too old to learn is Mubarak, and though unfortunately he is married, I recommend that we should concentrate our attention on him, giving him first a tutor who would have a thorough knowledge of admin sJLt rat ion, say a man of the E .A.C. class. This man should give him a years traingng and general education, and he should then be sent for three rv i fma years to the Pun^abin exactly the same way as political pro bationers are sent. The admin silt rat ion of Bahrein must keep pace with the times, and this is the only way he will learn how to guide it. Unless action is tarcen quickly and steps are taken to see that he really leahrd something useful, he will soon become as hopeless the rest of his cousins. 12. I have submitted my views about the Customs in my letter No.74of 25/5/29. The Director of Customs is really the chief revenue officer in Bahrein, and Passport Officer and Port Officer as well« Mr de Grenier is well fitted for his duties and has increased the yield by 20 % without the duty having been raised in any way. In the days of the Hindus, the accounts were }nept in Sindhi and it was found that apart from the embez zlement of some 100,000 rupees per annum, lai the farmer of the customs allowed several of the biggest merchants, men sxuch as Yusuf Kanoo and Yusuf Fakhroo to pay their duty annually ! A Syrian or Egyptian would soon acquire great influence if a ca pable man ? and might become a political danger. The Syrian Cus- ^ ^ toms in Beirut are proverbially dishonest even under 7rench su- ; pervision, and I believe Egyptians have proved a failure even ^ in a much smaller charge like Muscat. 13. The reformed, or rather the new court has done excel- [A tl/ Pag e.7 excellent wor]c&gt; and has 'tlie suutx confidence of tlie pu--blic« They refer all cases involving personal law to the appropriate Qadhis for their opinion and return ( hence records are icept ) hut dispose of most criminal cases themselves. A few criminal cases which can 'be settled 'by oathtaking are also referred to the Qadhis in the same way. It must be remembered however that Shaikh Salman would not pass any order adversely affecting a person of position if it were not for the support of Mr Belgrave, and would certainly not give a capital sentence in any case with out it. A whole hearted return to the Shara^ is impossible, (a) because most of the crimes of violence would be b^r Sunnis and against Shiahs, hence on the case being referred to the Sun- ni ^adhi they would escape scot free or with light punishment, (b) because the Qadhis keep no records, and ( c ) because here as in Persia the ^adhis have lost almost all their prestige in the last few years. Civil cases particularly those involving the taking of acKJum counts are usually referred to the Majlis el Urfi, an honorary body of merchants who work quite satisfactorily if their personal feelings are not aroused. Diving csjaes are referred to the Sali fah or diving court, to which I allude later. It will be seen that there is a very large measure of indi genous contrxol, and I feel sure that the Government of India / could not favour a return to the chaos of the old regime where no State court existed, and nothing to take its place except the Shara^ ( a reversion to which would be as well advised as to place Ely once more under its Bishop ) and the innumerable courts maintained by petty Shaikhlings purely as a vehicle fot their oppression. 14. A properly constituted Diving Court has been a very succesful feature of the reforms, and it works with fair impar tiality except where foreigners are involved. In a very big case recently I had to depute the Khan Bahadur to watch the pro ceedings so flagrant was the bias shown. As a result the court ultimately decreed in favour of the Persian merchant for somePage. 8 50,000/- though earlier they wished to force a compromise of Rs 700/- on him. It must be remembered that if we do not up hold the rights of foreigners their own Governments will imme diately claim to do so. Though much still remains to be L done great improvemtn has been made in checking naJchudas led gers, and divers books are now properly kept. Divers accept the figures shown in their books without question, but many are still indebted for as much as 3000/- and are therefore enslaved to their nakhudas for the rest of their lives. I have never un derstood the hypocritical attitude which sheds crocodile tears over nominal slaves who are usually well treated by their mas- any ters and yet refuses to mathing for a body of men who are ensla ved to a dangerous profession; men who if they are 1 protected ♦ subjects have to be kept at it by all the rigours of British law and returned to their masters if they run away and will not pay their debts. I feel that there is nothing that we can undo here without grave injustice to a class that is quite un able to help itself. 15. The Land department has very nearly completed its sur vey, and the title deeds granted are greatly valued. In fact in a case involving property a party usually opens its case by flourishing the title deed in the face of the court. This, if it a deed issued under the supervision of the Land dept. is a usually considered to settle the case out of hand .' As a mat- ter of k fact there is an urgent need for a settlement and a proper Land department as understood in India with records of rights, encouragements of improvementxs and loans etc. This department is very popular* and nothing but good can accrue from it. 16. The Punjabi Armed Police are efficient and loyal and give no trouble and are liked by the Shaikh and people. The old Levy Corps were composed largely of undesirables from Mus cat and were a source of danger. The uniformed police are mostly Persians as very few Arabs will do this work. They do their work well, and are all dressed in Arab kit.Page 9. The Nature, or night watchmen, are rather a wild body but are suited to local requirements. This is the only force that Arabs will Join as they can resign easily and go diving and they are not obliged to wear uniform. It is found impossible to keep them up to ste|rngth without employing a certain number of £a- luchis, as the only work that really interests Arabs of this class is something to do with boats. It is tnue that since the beginning of 1927 crimes of vio lence have been rare, but the fact tha.t my predecessor, an offi- exceptional cer of A experience and ability in dealing with Arabs was able, by a ydiifcy prudent policy of cautious consolidation to realise peace for over two years, must not be allowed to give the im pression that the Police force are in any way unnecessary or or unduly large. The prosperity of Bahrein attracts a floating population of undesirables at the best of times, and such peo ple need a firm hand. 17. I do not feel that this is the moment to part with the British Commandant of Police, Captain Parke. We shall shortly see an oil company commencing operations on a great scale and hundreds of rascals and cutthroats thronging in their footsteps. They have the right to appoint their own police and will certain ly appoint one or more Europeans for the work. In such a crowd of Europeans our own Commandant of Police will be unnoticed, and in view of the collisions with Europeans and Eurasians that will undoubtedly occur we need someone with authority to deal with them. Captain Parke is popular with the Shaikh, ( if not so popular with the public ) and it is essential that there should be someone to act for Mr Belgrave when he goes on leave. Mr de Grenier is quite unfitted to do this, not has he the time. I believe, however^that a better ,for the job than Captain Par^e could be found, and I know an ex-Nigerian Civil servant who would be more suitable. Until the question of the oil is finally settled I consider we should retain a British Commandant, but if the concession is not taken up, the post might,if Government are determined to discharge one adviser,Page 10. 'be allowed to lapse. 18. The Indian Armed Police do certainly catch the eye, as Sir Penys Bray has observed, and advertise British Sontrol so I recommend their replacement by Sudanese. Yemenis have an un enviable reputation for treachery and mutiny, and would be no improvement on the old Levy Corps, but I fought with Sudanese in the giKxi War, and have the highest opinion of their value. Their knowledge of Arabic would be a great asset, and owing to the number of negroid divers and others here, they would be incon spicuous in Arab clothing whepar an Indian in Arab dress is al ways recognisable at a distance. We could import them direct from Port Sudan and they would probably be cheaper in the long run than Indians. I suggest that Mr Belgrave selects the* men qjj his way back from leave in 1931 when the contracts of tLe pre sent force will have expired. It would be most advisable txsm for him to do this as military units have an unpleasant habit of transferring men they wish to get rid of, and the Bahrein State had a deplorable experience of this in the old Levy Cprps. should it be desired to take this step at once. Captain Parke could come through the Sudan on his way back from leave and bring the men with him, but this would involve the State in large sums lor breach of contract. 19. As regards Public Works, the Manama Sea Road is complete, the contract for the Electric Light scheme given out, and the Shaikh's palace and other works have been completed, and now, the dearest wish of the Bahrein public, the Manama -luuharraq cause way and bridge will shortly be commenced. The British Government has acquired great merit by these works, for the public realise that but for us they would have never been undertaken. There is nothing that can be undone here, and I feel that further progress cannot be objected to, so long as projects are soundly conceived and within the means of the State. 20. Five boys schools and one girls school now exist, as compared with one in 1921. For want of local material these schools are staffed almost entirely with Iraqia and Syrians.Page II. An instance of the growing prestige of the Bahrein Government has just come to light. Shaiih Abdullah,who has had entire charge of the Sunni schools from their inception has just come to see ¥r BeIgrave and told him that he is not satisfied with their pre sent condition, that he wishes them to be under the Government in the future, and that as he feels he does not know enough to direct their energies singlehanded he v/ishes a good inspector to be engaged especially for them. This, coupled with the increa sing demand for technical education shows that the State is hard put to it to meet the demand for education let alone consider a reactionary step. This education is however, dependent for its existence on the funds collected by the Director of Customs, and conserved by the Adviser, and any loss of revenue would serious ly affect it. * 20. With the approval of the State but entirely of their own accord the Shajihs decided that they could manage the Y/akfs better than the Qadhis and have taken them over without opposi tion. Public opinion will no doubt soon move the Sunnis to take the same steps and then large sums now pocketed by the ^adhis will become available for primary education and other purposes for which the endowments were made. I see ntthing to be gained by putting the clock back here, and it is well known that the Egyptian, Iraq and Syrian Governments have already organised Waqf departments. 21 • The Manama municipality have made great strides and Mu- harraq is rapidly catching up Manama. The city fathers take t-aem ^selves very seriously, but if MLkiKk neither the A.dviser or the Political Agent are present their meeting is apt to degenerate into a screaming match. Much sound work has, however, been done and their work is on the whole appreciated by the public. A minimum of interference is made by the Adviser, who in fact has /e little time to give^them, and the Political Agent only takes ac tion when British or foreign interests are involved. Towns of over 25,000 inhabitants must have mmnicipalities, and these are no exception to the rule.nA lb 9d ■ Page 12. 22. I confess that I can find nothing that can be uprooted in all this, for what were considered startling innovations six years ago are now accepted as part and parcel of every day life. ITor do I feel that Bahrein can aptly be compared with Kalat. So far as I know there are no foreign pov/ers restless and eager to to envelop it, with large and t'r|ubulent settlements of their na tionals within its frontiers. I do not know how many British of ficials there are in Kalat, but Ek when I was in Rajputana there were certainly three in Tonk, a state of far less Imperial impor tance than Bahrein, and two of these were government servants on deputation. If Indian Sates be cited as a parallel I will say that in no Indian State does the Political Agency handle 2000 civil and criminal cases per annum coming from all over the State and not, xrom ciny ceded area, and that so long as this -position as is maintained, and xb long as we represent foreign interests it must be, so long will a readjustment of the number of British of ficials have little effect. 23. Bahrein is the keystone of our position in the Gulf, and y the navel of the Arabian Air route, and a demand will shortly 0 i come from the Royal Air Force to be allowed to place half a xa? squadron here, or at least a flying boat. Our penetration of mi ^ Bahrein has been inevitable and is now accepted and it is too j/' 1 to go back now. In fact, it is obvious to the student of history that Bahrein will become another Zanzibar. If a protec torate is declared the day will be hastened and as the adminis- \ tration is more closely regulated.so our real power will diminish just as the power of the District Magistrate in Mount Abu has decreased since it was leased from the Sirohia State and made British territory. We should therefore, while not risking the improvements we have faced so much obloquy to bring about, set 0 ur face against any further extension of British influence, ^hich,paradoxically,will only weaken our position, and put off the evil day of what I may term Zanzibarisation as long as pos- u sible. Even Bin Saud is reported to have said that the Bahrein Shaikhs have solved their difficulties and have more money toPage 13. spend than ever before, so the effects of our penetration may not appear as unpalatable as we think. 24. I take it that Crovernment• s fear ±kkx our action in Bah rein will have unfavourable reperaussions on smaller Arab rulers is directed at the Trucial Coast and Q,atar. Both of these un doubtedly have leanings ( apart from religious reaons ) towards Bin Saud for his agents are with them the whole time, wheareas their only experience of us is confined to occasional menacing appearances eonnected with the arras traffic or slavery or faci lities for aircraft. If we wish to have any influence with these those of people, whose mental processes are little removed from a tribes- man of the days of Abraham, we must be able to offer them some thing in return for their friendship other than demands or threats. 28. It is a matter of common knowledge that since the loss of the * Lawrence 1 the Political Department has been immobilised in the Gulf, and the Trucial Coast has been run largely by a ser ies of sloop commanders, or rather their interpteters. On my recent visit to Abu Dhabi I found that no one there knew the name of a single Political Officer except Sir Percy Cox, for whom they appeared to have the greatest veneration. The brother of the Shaikh of Debai said to me when he was here ' Ya baliuz, trade Cokkus was our father. ' We cannot KxrrjpoMi indefinitely on Sir Percys reputation, and I only quote this to prove what I have always understood, that Arabs, though hostile to foreign penetra tion, are susceptible to personal friendships with British offi cers, even against their better judgment. It is by this means, and by a more constant contact by properly qualified people, that we shall recover lost ground on the Trucial Coast, and not by throwing overboard officials in Bahrein Just as everyone is convinced the reign of Saturn is about to return. In this connection , if I^jor Trevor could say in 1912 that ' It is to be regretted in some ways that the pSjroccupations ox the Political Agent in Bahrein and the largely judicial position he holds make it difficult for him to go out of his way to culti-Page 14 the vate the acquaintance of Arabs personally 9 the remark has great er force now, when double the number of judicial cases are dealt with. I personally consider that I should spend hours daily in the society of the Shaikhs and important Arabs, and so do more to win their confidence than penning the nimblest judgments would achieve, and I trust that the proposals which I shall presently put forward will receive sympathetic eonsideration. 26. It must be remembered that if we will not assert our selves in Bahrein,others will, and the ground is steadily pre pared for Bin Saud by his powerful and assiduous agant| should he succeed in his present camp'^agn in Nejd we may expect an imme diate resumption of his penetration here, a penetration which would find ample scope if Nejdis and Hasawis affairs were handed 'back to the Bahrein Government. It must be remembered that Bin Saud has an almost mesmeric effectoon Shaikh Hamad, and it is my constant fear that in setting Bin Saud up as an all-Arabian con queror we shall have provided ourselves with another Reza Shah to clip our wings, and have cut a rod for our backs without receiving any substantial return. 27. It has been suggested that in order to bring the Shaikh^ rule into the foreground a council should be appointed. This would probably be of value if Shaikh Hamad were allowed to trans fer real power to it and to rule as a ruler advised by his minis ters. Shaikh Hamad would be delighted by such an arrangement, and on the death of Shaikh Isa it might be given a trial. The ■■ council could be composed of Shaikh Salman and Shaikh Abdullah ' N and the Adviser. Shaikh Salman's claim as heir is obvious, and y \ (*1 Shaikh Abdullah apart from his ability seems to have turned over v'a new leaf and should be worth a trial. But , I feel we should wait until Shaikh Isa dies, for the State already supports one ,h Shaikh in idleness, and to support two generations at a cost of life' 2-J- lakhs would cause unfavourable comment. 11 Shaikh Hamad were made Fresxident of this council, nothing would be gained as his aversion to any form of work would make him avoid its deli berations, and the division of authority that would ensue wouldPage 15. only cause confusion. in apx^ointing the comncil it would be advisable to choose a moment when Shailch Muhammad was away on one of his periodical visits to India, as he would feel he should oe included and though a poet of repute, he has a great capacity for confusing issues and settling nothing. 28. I have just discussed the question of a tutor for Hubaral with Shaikh Kamad. He would welcome one, especially one who could train him in administrative matters, but he said that ±he could not possibly leave Bahrein as he was married, and could not talce his wife with him. To leave the State without her is apparently unthinkable. I then suggested that Daiy should be sent to the Military School in Iraq which catered for boys of gooG family, but he told me that this would also be impossible for apart from the great love they all had for him ( a thorough ly spoilt child ) both he and Mubarak had lost weight when they were sent to Basra to the American school, and the servant sent with them had died of consumption shortly after their return/ I propose therefore to concentrate on getting a suitable tutor and will trust to overcoming the Shaikh^ objections to a wider experience for Mubarak later. 29. A son of Shaikh Ibrahim, now on holiday from Beirut University, seems to be the only young al Khalifa with a tasxte for woixv anr suggest that when he has completed his course 'fefcuf there he should be sent to India for training by the Customs Department, and then to Basra to study conditions there, with a view to becoming an assistant to Mr de Grenier and when he under stood the work taking it over. This will be a solution for one adviser but not an immediate one. I am particularly anxious to avoid pwting Syrian and Egyptian freelances to high posts in the State, and if Bin Saud's Foreign Minister could say to a foreign representative ( Jeddah diary for March *29 ) ' I am the King, the Amir and the Government in the Hedjaz ' what may we ? expect in Bahrein. This worthy was an out of work Palestinian school master, and we should be foolish indeed to subsitute a Syrian of Egyptian autocrat for a British official. I think IIf/ Page 16. have mentioned thetpeople are alreadyk thinking that there are too many Syrians in the State, particularly^amongst the school- 30. To sum up. I can find no reform that can be usefully repealed except tliat I suggest that Indians be xaiiziziJijtRi re placed by Sudanese in the Armed Police. As concrete suggestions I propose that kubarak be trained,like Prince George, in adminis tration, and that his cousin be earmarked for the Customs Direc torship should he ti^un out well. I further suggest that as soon as Shaikh Isa dies the experiment of a council be given a trial, and real power given to it. I must say, however, that if our object is to increase our influence in ^atar and on the Trucial Coast, we must go there and work for it, for by no other means will we attain it. masters I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Polixic ^kL Agenx, Bahrein'7 Supplementary JUewa to Diary no.ii dated ist June i9S9.

The ohai-da called on the Political Agent the same afternoon, and seemed slightly ashamed of his weaimess, but said that the divers were poor men. As a matter of fact the Khanchia has been exceptionally good this year and at least 60 % of the men had been out on it and had received their earnings in cash. Beyond drawing the Shaikhs attention to the fact that going back on his own proclamations before they were three days old and bowing to pressure of this nature would encourage further demonstrations, there seemed nothing to be done except to accept the fait accompli. This is of course a set back in the attempt to reduce the indebtedneas of aivers but an attempt will be made to make a small reduction at the end of season advance.

For persoatnal law and inheritance, I dont see why the Ghara-ta should not be preserved intact so long as we can get reasonably efficient Q,adhis. They are keeping it on in Iraq, and we have our Muhammadan lav/ in India, in fact I believe in the U.P. and the Delhi Province they even recognise Q,adhis. Commercial Law we have handed over more or less to the Majlis el Urfi, with quite good results, and this is a / o|ptent barrier against Zanzibarixation. But for serious criminal cases, if we are to have peace, the r hara t a must be gently and gradually cast over board and the Sudan Penal Code or another based on the I.P.C substituted. According to the Shara'a a relation of the victim, or else an accomplice^is no witness, so that if one is reasonably prudent in choosing the occasion one could mur- V I ^ der a man in the bosom of his family and still be in no dan ger of a conviction. Also as you know, we have here the ■» fact of Sunni criminals being entitled to trial before a Shnni tribunal, being defendants, with the result that they c^re or would be gently dealt with.

The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Hesident, in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. J emorandum. In continuation of my letter C/84 and in reply to your telegram regarding reforms in Bahrein my reply to the points raised is as follows, 2. The demand for medical help and midwives came from the Baladiyya, and so may well be said to be general. The demand for technical education is very widely felt and though I have only discussed the matter with the better edu cated I can safely say that there is a very general wish for some form of it in Bahrein. It is frequently pointed out to A me that all masons and carpenters and almost all mecknics are * brought in from outside. Kanoo is opposed to it, or at any rate damns it with faint praise, as he would prefer that his mechani should be the only skilled men in the Islands. 3. I have revised rnyKH opinion about Shaiich Ab-^ dullah and I think that any messages that pass between him and \ Bin Saud are probably only polite nothings. His dislike or jealousy of Bin Saud was proved in no uncertain way the day v before D left. He told me about the narrow escape of Bin Saudi son betweennRiadh and Hasa and the burning of all his cars with obvious pleasure at his discomfiture. 4. I fear Mubarak will need more than a year with a tutor before he can derive much advantage from outside trian- ing. It was never my intention that he should be trained up to be anything but an assistant to Shaikh Salman, v^iose claim I mention in para 27. 5. Shaikh Hamad has agreed to a tutor, and I am asking separately fcr his deputation. Until he has started work I do not consider there is anything to be done, but should he impede the boys studies a v/arning might be useful. His two brothers have volunteered to bring pressure to bear upon himConfidential letter from the Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. J. Barrett C.S .I., C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No 385-S dated the 28th August 1929. • ,7 I have the honour to refer to your letter No. F. 164-N./2^ of the 28th May 1929 [Serial No. (1)], asking me to examine the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a view to deciding how far it is possible and expedient now to retrace the steps which have been taken. 2. The history of the development of our concern in the internal affairs of the Islands is fully set forth in Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth's No. 295-S- of 1st Septem ber 1927, so it is unnecessary to repeat it. i N I wish, however, to stress the following points :— (a) In 1869 we had installed Shaikh Isa as Ruler of the islands and it was entirely due to our support that he had been able to keep his position ; {b) From 1877 to 1900 we attempted, with our advice, to improve internal conditions, but were most concerned about financial conditions and particularly the Customs administration ; (c) From 1904, with the appointment of a British Political Agent to Bahrain. after the visit of Lord Curzon, our interests in internal matters in creased, and we continued to press Shaikh Isa with good advice. He, however, seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us, than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained ; (d) In 1904, following on riots in which Persians and a German were concern ed and in which Shaikh Isa was first supine and then obstructive, the A iceroy. Lord Curzon, advocated vigorous measures against him as he was ' only encouraged in his obstinacy by our continued forbear ance'. The most important results of our intervention were the abolishment of Shukra so far as foreigners were concerned, the banishment to Bombay of the leader of the anti-Persian riots (who was Shaikh Isa's own nephew), and the assumption by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners. The Shaikh was reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political Resident. In this^ case the impossibility of obtaining justice for Shiahs from the Sunni Qadhis was brought to notice.5 In connection with these events Major Cox reported :— ' I do not see how we can expect anything but periodical trouble from a continuation of our laudable endeavours to carry on the Gov ernment of the islands through the rule of a chief, who has shown himself to possess few, if any, of the qualifications necessary for the maintenance of order, the security of persons and of trade he was accordingly in favour of stronger measures but His Majesty's Government decided that the amelioration of the internal govern ment should be sought by indirect and pacific means ; {e) In 1919 Shaikh Abdulla's interview with Sir Arthur Hirtzel showed how the Ruler chafed against the interference of the Political Agent in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners and appointments to the Bench of Magistrates. Although the Political Agent possessed these powers, he was powerless to stop misrule ; (f) The gross oppression from which the deposition of Shaikh Isa in 1923 rescued the people—especially the Baharanah, and the opening that this oppression gave to foreign nations—especially the Persians and the WahaHis. The oppression is set out in the extracts from Major Daly's report forwarded to Government under Colonel Trevor's letter No. 23-S., dated the 8th January 1922 ; {g) Colonel Knox brought to the notice of Government that the whole management of affairs would more and more come into the hands of the Political Agent ; (A) With an uneducated Arab independence means the power to do many things of which we do not approve. It means administering the islands for the sake of the Chief of the tribes, exploiting the people for the rulers, and treating the Shiahs as a people of an unprivileged class; (i) Government, and not the Political Agent, finally had to insist on threats instead of advice ; {j) Shaikh Hamad is a pleasant man but weak, and it is idle to pretend he and his brothers would not backslide. To relax too much means to go through the same grind as we have come. 3. Throughout the History of Bahrain during the twentieth century, the fear of interference displayed by the Government of India is apparent. In 1904 they decided ' to pursue a cautions policy Later, the Political Agent was to ' seek the amelioration of the internal government by indirect and pacific means, and by gaining the confidence and trust of the Shaikh. ' In 1922 they 'did not desire to be drawn into interference between the Shaikh and his people ' Government are not prepared to act until they are satisfied all local resources are exhausted '. Yet it was this Government, who were so obviously and sincerely anxious to avoid interference, which finally had to order the Political Resident to take the steps which led to the deposition of the Ruler. They never, however, forgot their original policy, and within a couple of months are again warning the Political Agent to be on his guard against being tempted to interfere too much, or to become the administrative officer rather than the adviser. ft is obvious that Government did their very best to avoid the action of 1923 ; but it was forced on them by the gross tyranny of the A1 Khalifa, whom Shaikh Isa made no attempt to restrain, and by the pressure of the London Foreign Office, fearful of the reaction in Persia of the oppression of a Shiah population, and because misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case if the status of Bahrain ai i&lt;i our position in the Islands was brought before the League of Nations '. 4. The point to remember now is that Shaikh Isa, the Ruler, was not bad natured at heart. Although obstinate in rejecting all advice from the Political Agents as derogatory to his position as an independent ruler, he was easy-going and had a strong dislike for interfering with the actions of members of his family even w hen these took the form of gross tyranny. The family—the A1 Khalifa—were ^educated savages with a veneer of town manners. The outlook of Shaikh Isa and his family was as is described in paragraph 2 {h) above. Now Shaikh HamadVI is extremely amiable, with a constitutional disinclination to take strong measures on any subject. Even as a judge, his inclination is to acquit an obvious criminal and himself to pay a fine imposed. Such a man—except in the fact that he is younger and has seen changes taking place around him and that he is, in conse quence, less conservative—is not to be differentiated from his father. Just as his father permitted oppression but did not actively oppress, so would Hamad act. With the exception of Shaikh Khalid, all the old oppressors are still alive and will ing to resume their former ways if not repressed. Shaikh Hamad would certainly not repress them if deprived of active British support and direction. To this dav his weakness in any matter connected with the Al Khalifa is pathetic. In ordinarv matters also, in spite of the presence in Bahrain of a British adviser, he truckles to any show of force. In May of this year he reversed a decision he had made the previous day regarding the amount of advance to divers because a mob of two hun dred unarmed men made a clamour in his Majlis. It is certainly better that Shaikh Hamad should govern and make mistakes than that we should govern and make none, but a man of his type, who will not incur the odium of governing, must have an adviser. If the European adviser were removed. Shaikh Hamad would surely fall under the influence of some intriguing Syrian or Egyptian who would, for a consideration, play into the hands of Persia or Najd. It was the defencelessness of the Bahrain Government in the face of gang robberies which led to the insti tution of the Indian armed police. These police had to be foreign as the Bahrain Arab was averse from wearing uniform, had an objection to an occupation un connected with boats and disliked binding himself to fixed periods of duty. The armed police are still necessary, but it may be possible to make them less ob- strusively foreign by substituting Sudanese for Indians, directly the contract of the latter expires at the beginning of 1931. Owing to the large number of blacks, descended from slaves domiciled in the islands, the Sudanese would melt into the landscape in a way the Indians fail to do. Mr. Belgrave, the present Adviser to Shaikh Hamad,, has experience of Sudanese, having served with them in Egypt during the war. I would have recommended that the present European Comman dant of Police—whose four-year contract expires about the same time— should depart with the Indian policemen at the end of 1930. In view, however, of the pro bability that Bahrain may shortly have to submit to an influx of American and other foreign drillers and oil workers, I do not think it advisable to dispense with the services of a European Commandant of Police unless and until we are satisfied that the threatened invasion—which would certainly include a number of tough characters —will not take place. On the analogy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, the Gulf Syndicate would probably start a Security Service of its own, and the Bahrain State will require a European Commandant of Police to deal with it, ana with the bad characters attracted by the chance of employment. 5. I turn now to the Customs Department. This was an old bone of conten tion between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. It was Colonel Mead who first suggested bringing it under control, under the mistaken assumption that Shaikh Isa was really as poor as he pretended when the presence suited him. In any case the question of the Customs Department came for a time to be looked upon as a trial of strength between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. ihe old system was to farm out the customs to a Hindu contractor and, as was only to be expected, the revenue accruing to the State was much less than it should have been. This loss was estimated at one lakh of rupees a year, but judging from the yield of the Customs since it has been put under conscientious huropean control, it must have been considerably more. Customs is the main source of revenue to the State and brought in during the past year Es. 11,24,679 out of a total of Rs. 12,15,694. The Director of ( ustoms is not only in charge of the department from which lie takes his name, but lie is also Port Officer and controls the Passports, Kegis- tration of Boats, and various minor revenue departments. Owing to the lack- of natives with sufficient education and honesty to take charge of the various departments, a foreigner must be appointed to control them- At present the head is a European. Is anything to be gained by substituting an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraqian ?easures liminal t he is I conse- | &lt; as lus | ad act.

The Customs is not a political department and in Persia it can be staffed by foreigners without upsetting the political balance: but in a small nation like Bahrain the personality of the man who collects 90 % of the revenues must count for something. As in the case of the Adviser why Jettison a European, who can he trusted, in order to replace him by some foreign Oriental about whose integrity iind whose intrigues one can never be sure ? 6. Captain Prior, the present Political Agent at Bahrain, summed up the situation very well in one of his reports to me when he stated that Mr. de Grenier collects the revenues of the State and Mr. Belgrave conserves them. If the effi cient collector and conserver are removed, what is to happen to a State, which has become accustomed to a far higher rate of public expenditure than ever before in its history ? Not only have the claims of the idle and ever increasing A1 Khalifa been generously met, but .for the first time Bahrain has been administered for the good of its people and not merely for the benefit of its ruling family. With a decline in revenue, discontent is sure to return. If the European Adviser were removed, his place would be taken by an Arab from Bahrain—almost certainly one of the A1 Khalifa, With the exception of Shaikh Adbulla there is at the mo ment not a single member of the A1 Khalifa fit either by character or education to fill the post. Bahrain in the present day is not such a principality as those of the Trucial Coast, slumbering in the conditions of the seventh century. Thanks to its geographical situation as the gateway to Najd and to the pearl trade of which it is the centre, it has always been a trading centre, and has attracted to itself a number of foreigners, who are in contact with the outside world- Thanks to the interest taken by the Government of India in 1923, its administration, once a by-word, is now the admiration of the Gulf. The more enlightened citizens of Dubai, for instance, envy Bahrain though the ruling Shaikhs have no desire to copy it. 7. It has repeatedly been said that Bahrain has been westernised too hurriedly. It is necessary to examine this statement for although there is a substratum of truth in it, I think it conveys a wrong impression that all native institutions have been ruthlessly swept away. The reforms instituted in or shortly before 1923 related to— {■a) Municipalities, {b) Reorganisation of the Customs department. (c) Institution of a proper Police force. {d) Appointment of an Adviser to the Shaikh. (e) Reformed Courts. (/) Reforms in connection with the pearl fishery. (g) Survey. (A) Public Works. (i) Education. {j) Reform of the Waqfs. 1 will take the above seriatim. {a) Before and during the w T ar, Bahrain was notorious for its unhealthy climate, the stench was indescribable and plague visited it every alternate year. In the course of years the people of Manama, the chief trading town, had been becoming more and more enlightened by contact with the outside world. A demand for greater cleanliness arose and in spite of the opposition of Shaikh Isa, the demand, backed by Major Dickson (the Political Agent), prevailed and a municipality was established in 1920. This municipality still exists and in 1927 was followed by the establishment of another in Muharraq. The tw^o Municipal Councils—the members of which are partly nominated by the Ruler and partly elected—are presided over by Shaikh Hamad's brothers. The Political Agent and Adviser attend the meetings but take little part in the proceedings unless isked for guidance.\p In 1920, a considerable part of the population looked upon the Manama municipality as an objectionable foreign innovation, but it is now recognised as. a valuable portion of the administration. The Muharraq municipality was established in 1927 in consequence of popular demand without consulting the Political Agent. People recognise that if the municipalities were abolished ' filth and plague would return. The benefit derived from the presence at municipal meetings of the Political: Agent and the Adviser, who have no vote, is to lend a certain decorum to the proceedings, which otherwise have a tendency to become pandemonium. They do not interfere unduly, and their complete withdrawal from interest in municipal affairs would be unpopular. (6), (c) and (d) have already been treated in paragraphs 4 and 5 above.. (e) Major Daly's report on the state of affairs in 1921 shows the conditions from which Bahrain was rescued. These conditions were largely due to the lack of any Court of Law, which could deal efficiently with offenders. The minor members of the Khalifa family terrorised the people just as they wished. The Qadhis were corrupt or impotent. A good Court of Law was a crying need, but the difficulty was to find a suitable magistrate. At first the Political Agent (Major Daly) sat as adviser to the local magistrate, but with the arrival of Mr. Belgrave he resigned his position ta the latter. At present there are the following courts functioning in Bahrain :— (1) The Joint Court on which the Kuler and the Political Agent sit to hear cases, civil and criminal, involving foreign and Bahrain subjects, in which the latter are defendants. There is also a small Joint Court presided over by the Indian Assistant and a minor A1 Khalifa ; (2) 1 he Political Agent's Court for the trial of all cases in which foreigners are concerned ; (3) The Court of Shaikh Sulaiman, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, assisted and advised by Mr. Belgrave for the trial of Bahrain subjects; (4) The Small Cause Court conducted by a minor member of the Al Khalifa.' In the first case all disputes are referred to one or other of these Courts. They usually deal themselves with criminal cases though a considerable number are referred to the Qadhis for settlement by the taking of oath. Civil cases, almost without exception, are referred to the Qadhis, the Majlis al Urfi or the Salifah Court for opinion. Judgment usually follows the opinion. The indigenous Courts are :— (а) 1 he Court of the Qadhis—Sunni or Shiah as the case may be ; (б) The Majlis al Urfi; (c) The Salifah or Diving Court. The Qadhis are the usual Islamic Courts having jurisdiction in all personal matters, divorces, inheritances, etc. They often advise in criminal matters, but their peculiar laws of evidence and the sharp differences between Shiah and Sunni make it impossible to hand criminal justice completely over to them, 1 he Majlis al Urfi is the Court dealing with the customary law of trade. It is the commercial court and all disputed commercial cases are referred to it. There are twenty members. Its meetings are weekly—ten members sitting on alternate 1 hursdays, undei an Al Khalifa president. It deals with trade disputes, on the whole expeditiously and well. Its members are all appointed by Shaikh Hamad, subject in the case of foreign members, to the Political Agent s veto. T he Salifah consists of three Arab experts versed in the customary law relating to diving. Befoic 102.^ this Court consisted of one venal old man whose decisions were a disgrace to the i^tate. Now, except for a bias against foreigners, it funp- tions satisfactorily.S\ VT From this description it will be seen that except in the Court of the Political Agent—established under the Order in Council—a member of the A1 Khalifa is associated with all the proceedings of justice. Even the Political Agent's Court refers many matters for native opinion and advice. As already stated, the A1 Khalifa are uneducated and ignorant and it would be impossible for them to manage affairs without the support given them by the Political Agent or the Adviser, Both Shaikh Hamad—when he can be aroused to interest himself—a.nd his son, Sulaiman, on all occasions, are excellent in dealing with cases demanding local knowledge ; but as they themselves confess they would not pass sentences of death or take action against prominent men without the support of their advisers. In the course of time, Shaikh Sulaiman may get sufficient courage to stand on his own feet. A successor will be trained to take his place, when he succeeds his father in the Rulership or gets tired of his magisterial work. (J) Before 1923 the divers were wholly in the hands of their nakhudas and the merchants, who worked through the single venal member of the Salifah. Now a proper system of accounts has been established and, thanks to the supervision of the Courts over the Salifah, the divers have very little cause for complaint. Their lot from being the worst has become the best in the Gulf. {g) Bahrain, in addition to town sites, has an extensive area under gardens- It was found that Shaikh Isa, as Lord of the Soil, in his happy-go-lucky way, had frequently sold or gifted the same area to two or even three different persons. The result was innumerable disputes, which could only be terminated by careful enquiry- followed by an accurate survey. A survey of all towns and of certain village areas followed. At first the survey of villages was resented as people could not understand tlie reason for it, but now they have come to realise its benefits. Those villages which have*not hitherto been surveyed, owing to paucity of staff, have begun to demand that a survey should be carried out immediately. (h) Public Works have not been numerous and there is no regular Public Works Department; but public utility w^orks such as the sea wall and the road alongside it are much appreciated. One of the results of these works is that the inhabitants of Kuwait and other ports are apt to point to the deficiencies of their home towns and get into trouble with their Shaikhs, but the leaven works. If Bahrain continues on its own initiative to supply public gardens and walks, start electric schemes and carry out works for the public benefit, such as the proposed causeway from Manama to Muharraq, it is sure, by its example, to ameliorate the conditions in its lesser advanced sisters on the Arab coast, and wean them from that surly isolation in which most of them live. I mention ' on its own initiative ' because all public utility schemes—except the Manama sea wall and road, which are the work of Major Daly,—were conceived by Bahrain subjects themselves, though they have looked to their European advisers for guidance. The British name is benefited by this progress. (i) Education is still backw T ard, but thanks to the push of Shaikh Abdulla? the Ruler's brother, it has made immense strides during the past two years. The drive in this case has come wholly from Bahrain subjects themselves. Except in the matter of making hitherto fraitless efforts to persuade Shaikh Hamad to educate his own sons, neither the Political Agent nor the Adviser has taken any steps unduly to push education, although their services in obtaining masters from Iraq have been put at the service of the State, when asked. Syrian and Iraqi masters have been imported in most cases without the intervention of the Political Agent or Adviser, at good salaries and there are now five indigenous Arabic boys' schools and one girls' school on the island, in addition to two Persian nationalist schools. In addition, eight Bahrain boys, including three close relations of the lluling Chief, have been sent to the American University at Beirut for education. I trust that these three boys will turn out well, and with Shaikh Mubarak— the most promising of the sons of Shaikh Hamad—will provide material for the higher appoi tments in the State, and ultimately will prove competent to take 0 ver the position now held by the European Adviser and Customs Director. &amp;C602FD10 ( /) Waqfs are eminently a religions matter in wliich it beTioves foreigners especially non-Muslims, to'walk very warily. Just before his departure, Major Daly, moved by certain bad scandals, attempted to take action to reform the Waqfs, but his successor decided it would be best not to interfere and to trust to the public opinion that was being stirred by the liberal policy of the State. The policy of non-interference appears to be justifying itself. Recently the Shiahs themselves appointed a com mittee which took over their Waqfs from the Qadhi. If the Sunnis follow suit, large sums now pocketed by the Qadhis may become available for primary education. 8. I have examined the present conduct of affairs in Bahrain and I see nothing that can be profitably altered at the present moment. Innovations which met with opposition in 1923 are now accepted as the ordinary scheme of things ; and the Bahrain merchants look forward to the develop ment of air communication under British auspices. The unpopularity of the British Government^ which was worked up in the Arabic and other press, has now disappeared and their good works are appreciated. In time the good works and the tyranny from which the British rescued Bahrain and especially the Shiah Baharanah will be forgotten, and only the privileged position of the British occupying the chief posts will be noticed. To avoid the odium which would fall on Britain, in course of time, from this cause it is necessary to educate natives of Bahrain to take the place of the British officials. 9. Captain Prior, Political Agent at Bahrain, thinks that a useful under study for Mr. de Grenier offers in Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim Al Khalifa—at present a third year student at the American University in Beirut. He has industry but unfortunately no great aptitude for arithmetic. Captain Prior thinks, however, that when he has completed his course at Beirut he might be sent to India for training in the Customs Department at Bombay or Karachi, before being appointed to the Bahrain Customs with a view eventually to taking over charge. I consider Captain Prior's proposal very sound and recommend it for adoption. If Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim's indifferent arithmetic is a bar to the efficient per formance of his duties, one of his younger cousins—Shaikh Khalifa bin Shaikh Mahomed or Shaikh Hamad bin Shaikh Abdulla r nephews of the present Deputy Ruler,—who are first-year students at Beirut, might later be selected for training. 10. There remains the question of a successor to the Adviser. Although Government do not appear to desire the immediate removal of Mr. Belgrave, this question must be considered. Shaikh Hamad, the Deputy Ruler, is an amiable nonentity. Captain Prior in alluding to his weakness and the impossibility of allowing him to stand on his own feet has stated truly: ''so long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem, get shooting and hawking and enough money to support him with a little pomp and pride of place, he does not mind what happens to Bahrain.' buch a man must have an adviser on whom he can lean. His natural adviser is his eldest son, Sulaiman, age about 35, who will probably succeed him. Sulaiman is not without promise ; he is intelligent and is gaining valuable experience on the Magisterial Bench, but he is uneducated and in some ways little removed from i Bedu. The only really capable member of the Al Khalifa family is Shaikh Hamad 's brother, Abdulla, who is self-educated, but is unfortunately distrusted by the people owing to his previous evil record. Of Shaikh Hamad s sons the one who shows most promise is Shaikh Mubarak, the the fourth son. In my letter No. 366-S. of 21st August 1929 I have already recom mended that a good tutor should be obtained for hinu It is hoped that in due course he may be given a chance to acquire administrative experience so as to be a help first to his father and then to his brother, Sulaiman, who has no son, to follow after him, and that he may in due course be able to perform the functions now falling to the European Adviser.11 11. W itli tlie spread of education it should be possible to conduct tlie adminis tration of Bahrain without any i&gt;fitisli interference in internal affairs in a manner which will not shame us. At present, owing to the weakness of the Deputy Ruler and the lack of men of suitable character, this is impossible. I have laid particular stress on education in the rulers because the merchant classes in Bahrain, both foreign and native, are advancing rapidly in this respect: and the public are demanding more schools, technical education, increased medical help and trained midwives, and larger public works. A go-ahead population cannot permanently be ruled by uneducated tribesmen any more than Moroccan troops could permanently hold down the Rhine provinces. Bahrain is a large trading centre with a large foreign population. It is not part of Najd and would never be happy under Wahabi rule. Tlie real Bahraini, though an Arab, is a Shiah not a Sunni; and the history of the islands shows that for long periods it was subject to Persia. This, although not leading to any desire for Persian rule, must modify the tribal outlook. 12. 1 am in favour of an indigenous Arab government standing on its own feet; but you cannot without grave risk of blood-shed—rapidly reverse all that has been done in the past six years. The Baharanah, for the first time since the Khalifa ousted the Persians, have had security and justice and have come to think of their rights. After tasting these sweets they will not lightly forego them. 13. 1 he evils of unadulterated Arab rule and the tribal system are exempli fied by the recent blood-stained record of Umm al Quwaim and Abu Dhabi or, to take bigger people from history, the Bani Rashid Rulers of Hail or the Saiyids of (-man. 1 o quote from an interesting review by Mr. B. S. Thomas appearing in the near East and India of July 18th, page 78 :— 1 he first act of young Said bin Sultan was to decoy his regent uncle and to assassinate him. This ' will to power ' was applauded by the country. It was no strange means to employ. Incidentally Said's successor, 1 huwaini, was destined to be murdered by his own son, Salim, who thereupon succeeded to the Sultanate. During the past five years fratri cide, a time-honoured institution for the purpose, has on three several occasions been responsible for a change of Shaikhship in the powerful Omani tribes of Bani Ali and Bani Yas.' Government interfered with the free working of the Arab system first when they placed Shaikh Isa in his father's room in 1869 and again when they replaced him by Shaikh Hamad in 1923. biider the Arab system Abdulla might have removed Shaikh Isa—he would certainly have removed Shaikh Hamad. Government is disturbed by the blood-stained record of Oman : they could not now permit similar occurrences in Bahrain. 14. We have to make the best of Shaikh Hamad and he must have an adviser— either European or Arab—or in the alternative take upon himself the role of a cons titutional king, confine his activities mainly to social affairs and leave business in the hands of a Council. Ihis Council system might well be tried, but only after the death of Shaikh Isa. The old Shaikh has retired from active interest in affairs, but he still counts for something, and his naturally conservative tendency renders him opposed to all change. In addition, on the score of expense to the State, it is not desirable that Bahrain, which is already paying a pension of Rs. 5,000 yearly to Shaikh Isa, should he saddled with an idle Hamad. 1 anticipate no serious opposition from Shaikh Hamad himself to the idea of a oun cil provided he is still titular and social head. It will give him a chance of that Qtium cum dignitate .for which he craves. I he members of the council might in the first place be Shaikhs Abdulla bin sa and Sulaiman bin Hamad with the Adviser as third member under the presi-12 dency of Shaikh Abdulla, with Shaikh Mubarak marked to succeed event ually to the Adviser s place. 15. I wish to emphasise that even at present there is considerably more Arab control of the Bahrain administration than would appear at first sight. In conse quence, the present administration is popular in the islands. 1 agree, however, that the British are too much in the high-lights, and that the signs of British influ ence appear too clearly in the Indian police force trained ILke an Indian infantry regiment thousj^h their uniform has been modified. I recommend that this high light be modified by substituting Sudanese, an Arab speaking force, which blends better with the population. I recommend further that, unless a European is re quired to deal with an influx of Europeans and Americans attracted by the Gulf Oil ^ the services of the European Commandant of I olice be dispensed with at the termination of his present contract, but that the services of the Ad\ iser and the Director of Customs be retained until suitable Arab substitutes have been trained to take their place. 16. Shaikh Hamad has already extended the tenn of the Advisers contract till March 1934. It will probably be necessary to grant him at least two further quaternary extensions. It is difficult to say when a substitute will be ready to replace Mr. de Grenier ; but the period required for training cannot be less than seven years from now. 17. As the coming of an oil company is still problematical, I have not dis cussed this matter at length. If the company should materialise it will of itself we'sternise the islands in possibly an unfortunate way, and 1 presume there would have to be a British element in the administration to counteract its effects. 18. It appears from paragraph 2 of your letter under reply that Government is perturbed at the danger that with the example of Bahrain before their eyes, the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of Bin Saud. It is true that the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are extremely jealous of any British encroachment on their independence just as Shaikh Isa was before his forced reli quishment of power. They oppose any concession to the European. I do not, however, ascribe this attitude wholly to the events in Bahrain. It is due far more to the natural exclusiveness of the Arab. A certain section of Arab thought would exclude the foot of the infidel throughout the holy land of Arabia, from Aden as well as from Mecca. No attempt had been made to westernise Bahrain when the ' Hyacinth ' episode of 1911 occurred. It is from this incident and the comparative immunity from evil consequences enjoyed by the people of Dubai that I date the increasingly independent attitude of the Trucial Shaikhs. Sir Percy Cox stated at the time that the incident furnished a convenient peg on which the Shaikh of Dubai could hang bis objections to the admission of Europeans to the coast. His statement was true in 1911 and is true to this day ; but the British policy in Bahrain obviously cannot be blamed for this. If we interfere in Bahrain to put down misrule, depose its Shaikh, introduce reforms and then permit the country to sink back into the slough from which we have rescued it, then indeed will we have forfeited Arab respect and cleared the way for Bin Saud. In 1920 Major Dickson reported ' our position in the island is found ed on fear and not respect.' Now it is founded on respect. The Trucial Chiefs now see that our intervention has benefited Bahrain and even its Chiefs. We cannot expect them immediately to call in British advisers on their own account, but in time their aversion from contact with the European may be overcome through the influence of a civilised Bahrain. It will not be overcome through a reversion of Bahrain to the conditions of 1920. If it suits Bin Saud he will intrigue in Oman as his fathers did before him. r I he attitude of the Shaikhs of the Coast will be guided by self-interest as it has ever been. If we have consistently and with success espoused their cause against Persia and Najd they will look to us for support. It we have shown no great energy in supporting their case against third parties, they will be discouraged and more easily succumb to Najd intrigue. If Bin Saud emerges victorious from13 his present troubles, it is possible that he will seek to extend his influence on the Coast and cause us trouble as Reza Shah has in Persia ; but I do not see how the situation in Bahrain will affect the issue. All Arabs criticised our action in Bahrain when the supporters of the old regime were crying out under chastisement. The chastisement was salutary and Shaikh Isa's supporters have accepted the present regime, which is not unduly westernised. I have shown some ways in which the outward form may be modified while retaining the spirit, but I do not advise the jettisoning of useful European officials nor the taking of any steps other than those I have indicated. 19. I am much indebted to Captain Prior, now Political Agent at Bahrain, for a long report, on which and my own experience of the islands during periods extend ing over two and a half years I have based these observations. l fid ^ 1&gt;^ au- V c- MKEFB—10.10-29—20—GIPS14 (9) MEMORANDUM. The paper specified below was transmitted to the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London, for the information of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, under cover of the Foreign Secretary's letter No. 85-M., dated the 12th September 1929. Letter from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 385-S., dated the 28th August 1929. (10) Telegram P., phom the Secretary of State for India, London, No. 3651, dated the 23 rd November 1929. I shall be glad to have as soon as possible your views regarding British element in Bahrein administration referred to in Barrett's Despatch August 28th No. 385-S. (Serial No. 9), received under your Foreign Secretarv's letter of September 12th (Serial No 10). In connection with question of our future policy in Bahrein matter is of interest—see my telegram No. 3046 of the 1st ultimo, paragraph No. 4, also your reply of No. 3171-S., October 22nd (File No. 366-N./29). (11) Telegram P v ., to the Secretary of State for India, London, No. 3458-S., dated the 26 th November 1929. Your telegram 3651 (Serial No. 10). In Bahrein there are at present a British Political Agent, British Adviser who inter alia sits in the Court of trial of Bahrein subjects, British Director of Customs, British Commandant of Police with highly trained Indian Police force under him. Thus though the total population is certainly not more than 1^0,000 and may be consi derably less British element is stronger than in an ord nary Indian district let alone an Indian State. As a result decent Government has been estab lished, finances have been put on sound footing and there has been much progress generally since 1923 when misrule forced us to induce Sheikh Isa to retire. Population is composed of so many heterogeneous elements that un animity of opinion regarding these developments is hardly to be expected. But Resident is no doubt right in feeling that decent government and especi ally the increased prosperity are appreciated by most and that we ourselves gain fair share of credit for it. At the same time he is equally right in say ing that in time conditions from w T hich British rescued Bahrein will be for gotten and odium will fall on us for occupying a position so privileged and predominant. Outside Bahrein Barrett feels that its administration is now the admiration of the Gulf. This seems open to question for there have been ^gns of Arab uneasiness not merely on the Trucial coast but in Kuwait over the object lesson afforded by Bahrein of the rapid attenuation of the Arab spirit and forms of government once our powerful influence is admitted, oheikh Hamad's encouragement of Bin Sand's intercessions on behalf of Bahrein tribesmen whom he himself had been forced to expel under pressure nom us and whom Arab public opinion demanded that he should receive back jn the customary way after the customary formalities had been fulfilled [vide papers forwarded under Foreign Secretary's letter Of 16th June 1927 is an arresting example of Barrett's maxim that it is better that the oheikh should govern and make mistakes than that we should govern and oiake none.cbs. arai i 15 There can of course bo no question of rapidly reversing all that has been done in the past six years. It has indeed been good in itself. Still less can there be any question of our relaxing our essential hold on Bahrein. Only question is whether time has now come to check the momentum towards complete Westernisation and to lay down general lines of policy which while making for continuance of decent government and sober progress will save us from the odium and at the same time from the dangers inside and outside Bahrein which seem likely to flow from too obvious Westernisation and absorption of these tiny islands. V^Aiter all it is not only vis-a-vis the Arabs that it is politic for as to worlr through a genuinely Arab administration. Jt actually increases our power vis-a-vis foreign intruders : thus an obviously autonomous Arab State can close its doors in a way in which an obviously British run State cannot. Like Barrett we feel that nothing can be effected immediately even as regards the police until it is known whether the threatened invasion of Americans is going to materialise. If it does not materialise we feel that the Resident should be asked to work out definite schemes for his proposed substitution of Sudanese for Indian police and to tackle problem of who is to replace the British Commandant^Meanwhile he and the Political Agent should proceed steadily to advise the Sheikh to persist in the training of young Bahreinis with a view to their gradually filling various posts in &amp; the administration. ^ That there is no early prospect of either the present Adviser or Director of Customs being dispensable in the near future we aoree but think that it would be unwise and also unfair to the officers concerned to encourage them in an expectation of indefinitely prolonged service. )eriai ino . i (13) Endorsement from the Foreign and Political Department, No. r.-164- N./29, dated the 27 th November 1929.

Copies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry. (15) Letter from the Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf , No. 43 -S., dated the 13th February 1930. I have the honour to invite a reference to Mr. Acheson's letter No. F. 164-N./29, / dated 18th June 1929 [Serial No. (5)], regarding the retention of the services of Mr. C. deGrenier, Director of Customs, Bahrein. It was therein stated that the Government of India proposed to await the Resident's views on the general question of the ' westernisation ' of Bahrein before deciding on the particular question of the retention of Mr. deGrenier's services. These views have since been com municated to the Government of India by my predecessor, and they in turn have communicated their views to H. M.'s Secretary of State [Serial No. (9)] {vide telegram No. 3458-S., dated 26th November 1929) [Serial No. (11)]. Mr. de Grenier proposes to proceed on leave in April next, and is naturally anxious to know whether he is to return or not. I would therefore request that the Government of India may be pleased to pass orders in the matter. 2. In this connection I would venture to put before the Government of India the impressions that I gained during my recent visits to Bahrein. The present Ruler is Shaikh Hamad : he is entirely devoid of energy and has no desire to govern : he himself is glad to leave everything to the Adviser, and has to be pressed to give a decision on any matter. He retires on every possible occasion to his country seat 10 miles from the town in order to avoid petitioners and State worries, and it is at least doubtful whether, had the succession been allowed to take its course without any intervention on our part, he would not have been ousted by his more forceful brother Abdullah. Had the latter succeeded things would probably have been different but as it is we have to make the best of things as they are. The only question that really interests Shaikh Hamad is the allowances of himself and his family, and the A1 Khalifa family have not abandoned the former idea that the taxes paid by the inhabitants are the just spoils of the Ruling Family. 3. The revenues of Bahrein amount to about 40 lakhs, and of this 50 percent- is paid to the Shaikh and his relatives : he has made constant efforts to get this sum of 5 lakhs increased but both Colonel Barrett and I have informed him that we consider it ample, and have refused to agree to any increase. On the other hand Bahrein has practically only one source of income, the customs, which collect 97% of the total revenue. If the measure of control which is at present exercised by Europeans in Bahrein was sensibly relaxed I think there is very little doubt but that the revenues would be appreciably diminished, and allowances of the Ruling Family appreciably in«reased, and the result would be, if not immediate insolvency, at any rate a complete cessation of those educational, medical and sanitary developments that we have brought about, and which the people of Bahrein now expect, and clamour for. 4. I am in entire sympathy with the idea that we should work as far as possible through an Arab administration : no one w r ho has received his earliest training, as I did, in the Baluchistan school could be otherwise, but we must take account 0 f the actual circumstances. We have a ruler who, practically speaking, refuses to rule, and there are no state subjects at present sufficiently educated to fill the more important posts. MC7oFD18 5. It may be asked why we should not allow Bahrein to be run as, for instance Kuwait is, as an Arab city on Arab lines. The answer is that the population of the two cities is wholly dissimilar. The population of Kuwait is largely Bedouin : their outlook is towards and of the desert. The people who come and shop there are the desert Arabs of the interior. Kuwait commanded till recently the pick of the Bedouin tribes, the Ajman and Mutair, and all their wealth and trade came from traffic with the interior and from their flocks and herds. Finally Kuwait has a homogeneous population. The population of Bahrein is hetrogeneous and divided by racial and religious differences—Nejdis, Wahabis, Persians, Sunnis, Shiahs and large colonies of Mohammedan and Hindu Indians. Bahrain is a purely commercial centre, its outlook is towards Bombay and the stock markets of the world on which it depends to sell its pearls. The people who come and shop there are largely the wealthy pearl merchants of Paris and Bombay. It has no tribes worth mentioning, and an enervat ng and relaxing climate which shows itself in the Arabs who have settled there. Its wealth comes from its pearls almost entirely : it may perhaps be increased shortly by the discovery of oil. 7. Now with a population such as this, many of whose members are extremely wealthy, and which is brought in closer contact with the outside world than the population of any other place in the Gulf, it is not unnatural to find a strong desire for decent administration and for the amenities which they obtain elsewhere. As was stated in your telegram referred to above [Serial No. (11)], what we have done is good in itself. We have not foisted upon an unwilling people measures which they did not want or a horde of low paid officials, neither have we introduced vexatious rules or regulations. We have improved the lot of the diver and largely rescued him from virtual slavery : we have established simple courts where cases are ex peditiously settled, not on legal technicalities but on diving or commercial practice understood by all or according to the religious precepts of the parties concerned : we have enabled the State out of its own resources to make one or two good roads, to instal electric lights, and to make at any rate some small beginning with education. Finally, and to this I attach much importance, there are now in Bahrain two municipalities which do good work. Their resolutions are at times ludicrous, as for instance when they wished to decree that ladies must wear certain types of garments, but on the whole their work is satisfactory and at any rate the members are gaining some experience of local self-government, which it is to be hoped will in course of time enable them to be of service in a wider sphere. 8. Bahrain has 3 European officials, an Adviser, or Diwan as he would be called in India, a Superintendent of Police and a Director of Customs, and I must say that I think the State is extremely fortunate in the Europeans whose services it has secured. Mr. Bel grave is keen and tactful; has had previous experience of Arabs in the Colonial Service and speaks the language well and is a charming and cultured man to meet in himself : he struck me as being the best stamp of British official and just the man that is required. Mr. Parke I did not meet, as he is at home on leave, but the Political Agent spoke highly of him. Mr. deGrenier, though of a different type to Mr. Belgrave, is full of enthusiasm about the somewhat humdrum functions he is called upon to perform, and Colonel Barrett thought highly of him, as reported to the Government of India in his despatch No. 184-S., dated 1st June 1929 [Serial No. (4)]. 9. There is really no analogy between Bahrain and an Indian State. The latter can obtain as many fully trained Indian officials as they require, yet despite this an increasing number of them nowadays employ Europeans in different capa cities : Bahrain cannot obtain Bahrainis or Arabs qualified to hold the higher posts. Syrians and Egyptians are jusf as much foreigners as an Englishman is. 10. I therefore see no likelihood of the State being able to dispense with Mr' Bclgrave's services within any period that need at present be taken into account. Again as pointed out by the Government of India, the necessity for a European Superintendent of Police largely depends on whether the threatened influx of European oil-borers materialises or not. If it does then the presence of a European to deal with the hetrogeneous elements that will flock to the oil fields wil certainly bo necessary. It is not possible to come.to a decision at present. Mr. Parke is at present on leave and I understand will return for a year or two, but it is improh-19 able that lie will be willing to stay on after this. The question whether he should be replaced by another European or not will be considered then. 11. Mr. Belgrave spoke to me about the replacement of the Indian police by Soudanese, and I think it would be a good thing. There is a large negro element in Bahrain, and they would merge in the population more than Indians do. Mr. Belgrave has had previous experience of them in Egypt and says that they niake efficient police. He suggested to me that when he proceeded on leave in 1931 he should recruit them on his way out and bring them back with him. I think this arrangement would be satisfactory, and might be given effect to irrespec tive of the arrival or non-arrival of the oil company, and I trust the Government of India will be pleased to approve of it. 12. Finally, as pointed out by Colonel Barrett, Mr. deGrenier s functions are purely administrative, and not political: he has no hand in any matter that affects the daily lives of the people, and owing to the fact that the Bahrain revenue consists almost exclusively of the customs receipts, any falling off under this head is a much more serious matter than would be a decrease under one head in a more normal budget. His dealings are almost exclusively with the commercial classes, shipping companies, etc.. and not with the mass of the people. As Colonel Barrett asked, why replace a foreigner who has proved his efficiency by a less efficient foreigner, which is what the replacement of Mr. deGrenier by an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraki would mean. I may mention that Mr. de Grenier is on an indefinite contract terminab e by 3 months' notice on either side, so there will be no difficulty in dispensing with his services should this at any time be considered desirable. 13. To sum up, I do not think it will be possible to dispense with the services of Mr. Belgrave within any time that need be taken into consideration at present. As regards the police, Mr. Parke will probably resign in a year or two, and the question of his successor can be taken up then : it depends to a great extent on whether oil is found in Bahrain or not. Meanwhile however I recommend that steps should be taken to replace the Indian police by Soudanese next year, and request the approval of the Government of India to this. As regards the Customs, I would suggest that I be authorised to inform the Shaikh that there is no objection to the retention of Mr. de Grenier. 14. Since drafting the above I have been informed by H. M.'s Minister at Tehran that the Government of India have agreed in principle to the transfer of the Residency to the Arab side subject to certain conditions wh ch are at present under consideration in England. It seems not improbable that the Residency will be transferred to Bahrain : if so then it will, I think, be of little ava'l to try and ar rest the tendency towards 'westernisation'. If the Political Resident is to be permanently located at Bahrain, then the authority of the Shaikh must automati cally tend to decrease, and it will naturally be regarded as a most tantamount to the declaration of a definite protectorate over these islands, even though no formal announcement to that effect is made.

Firstly, I would say that, in rny opinion, it is very desirable to retain the services of a European police officer at Bahrain for some time to come. There is no Bahraini who is in any way qualified to fill this post, or who could exercise the necessary control over the police force or retain, the confidence of the general public. The heterogeneous nature of the population of Bahrain and the latent feuds among them render it most necessary that'the State should have at its disposal an adequate force to maintain the peace- ilr. Parke^- dees not, I understand, intend to stay on at Bahrain very much longer, but he is unwilling to commit himself to any definite period at present as much depends on certain domestic circumstances. In any case, howevef, he is prepared to remain on for another year. His services hitherto have been satisfactory and I have been impressed with the efficiency of the force that he commands, and he has now acquired a good knowledge of the local populace, and, of course, knows the language. I therefore consider it desirable that he should be kept on for the present at any rate.■ ; - Si</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000139_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/340</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000139</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/340</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 19/165 IV (C 57) Bahrain Reforms'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1927/1930</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (219 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.</extent><extent>A bound correspondence file.
