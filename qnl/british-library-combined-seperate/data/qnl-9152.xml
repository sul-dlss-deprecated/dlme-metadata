The increases are discussed against the background of the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907 (copy, folios 44-60), which provided that the Sheikh should not collect duty on goods imported by British subjects at a rate in excess of 4%. The file includes correspondence from the Foreign Office, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Political Agent Kuwait. Agreement was reached that the 6½% increase of 1941 should also apply to British subjects and British-protected persons.The file contains some papers of an earlier date than the main date range: copy of the Bunder Shweikh lease dated 1907 (folios 44-60); extract from the report on the trade of Kuwait, 1932-33 (folio 43).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Koweit</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
