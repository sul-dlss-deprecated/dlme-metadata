Some time ago I wrote to you about the possi bility of stopping Tangistani boats smuggling tea from -•V SjrT Bahr.in, and you replied indicating various difficulties v /hich I know from experience are very much to the point. But the position has been radically changed nince the death of banking and Oliphant. As you have no doubt seen in accounts of the recent outrage at Bushire, the ^il- waris under their headman Rais ^li and other neighbour ing villagers are amongst the most guilty, and they will, I hope, shorty receive a far more severe punish ment than'they did in 1913 after the piracy case. For years they havo been growing far too rich and lawless as the result of their unchecked smuggling of arms, ammunition, tea etc:. In anticipation of other measures we ^c.re now, with the help of the Governor of Bushire and the Customs, trying to make things as unpleasant for them as possible. Nearly everything they bring from SfHMHp:' K uwa i t . ajor r.H .Keyes, I.A., Political Agent,and Kuwait/ hk Bahrain is smuggled. It will not do for Dilwar (about 30 in num ber) and other Tangistani boats to find a refuge in Bahrain harbour during the period of their ostracism. I should be glad if you would give me a Jist of names of nakhudas and owners and villages of all Tangistani dhows noti at Bahrain: and at the same time let me know if you think either of the following courses would be feasible and if so which would be the easier course to take-r to intern all now there, or that may arrive by getting Shaikh isa with your co-operation to take away the rudders of the boats and locking « • them up ( a course which was used effectually in Bushire some years ago), or (2) to expel them without permitting them either to land or load cargo in Ma nama and Muharraq or adjacent villages. Or it might be possible to detain the dhows until we know it Government will agree to seizing tliem^or crtW perhaps you can suggest some way of worrying them. I see from a report of the Dilwar Customs* Officer that fearing reprisals there all dhows have been sent too f — 9 V to Bahrain. Is this correct? inshore in a fore ion town Tangistania are generally very timid mortals, and I should not think likely to give trouble.M * j i! b A h ra i n. 87111:15. / I was already iceeplng an eye on the Tangslrl boats when yours of the 28th; arrived. Xeencl the list. Those who have returned only made small purchases of tea and sugar In the marfcet. No tea has been bonded at for some time. I dont thinJc that either of the courses you suggest would be much good. Shaikh Isa's establishment Is so venal and incompetent that the action would not be very effective. If you are going to lane action, i shoil^ go the whole hog, and let me arrest ail Tangsiris and their uoats on a charge of smuggling 'at the request of the Govern- -or ot Bushire, The 'Nearchus* or some other vessel might be spared to tow the boats over, or I might beach them at the Agency pending developments. I win send you a better list by next nrnii, but you will see from tne one I enclose that the coats are .not taslng 'oast* here: they are merely engaJM on very petty trade.Telegram. Code.

About a month ago the Tangairie instigated by the German' ex-Gonsul made an attack on the British community in Buahire and killed 2 British Officers and one Indian soldier. About a week ago the Tangsiris attacked by night some of the houses of British subjects which are scattered at intervals between Bushire and Reshire. Some British subjects were kllJLed and some property looted. The Tangsiris were joined by other bad characters. The British have in consequence assumed the administration of Bushire and have sent ships to punish the Tangsiris. Bahrain, 16th August 1915.From Major T.H^Keyes, I.a.. Political Agent, BAHRAIN, The Hor^ble Liout-Colon^l Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I Political Keaident in the Persian Gulf, B A S U A H . B-ushire 2^rd Augunt 1915. Sir, l have the honour to report that H.kls Ships ^Pyra^us' and 'Dalhousie 11 arrived at Bahrain on the 18th instant, when your 1633-B of 16th instant was delivered to ne by the Commander of ,, Pyraraua ,, • 2« As there were no Tangsiri boats in Bahrain, T left the same afternoon in ^Pyramus 11 , arriving off Doha early on the 19th. Large numbers of boats were leaving Doha that morning, as the second fishing was Just commenctng .While 'Pyranais' was negotiating the difficult entrance to Doha bay, I went away in an armed cutter md examined all boats tiat were under sail but found no Tangsiri boats among them. 2S. tt Pyranus' having anchored within '&gt;,000 yard^ of Doha ^ort while ,, Dalhousie tt anchored out of range of the Turkish guns, I sent ray interpreter ashore to fetch Shaikh Abdullah, The Shaikh arrived on board in the early afternoon. ie assured me that there wore no Tangsiri boats ir his rort^ and that none had been there for some time, but said that be believed that some Turktah deserters had joined the Tangsiris with several rifles and large cjun^itities of am munition. He vehemently denied havin/r sent Rais Ali any ammunition and said that he had only sent him ft cloaVs in exchange for hawks tlais Ali had sent him. From independent &amp; ■ tmCMmmM e 'iindependent enquiries which I instituted in Doha and A1 Bid i am inclined to believe his version of the affair. 4. We then proceeded to discuss the question of the Turkish irort. Shaikh Abdulla infomed me that there were two Officers and forty men with two fiild guns and one mountain gun in the Fort. Entrenchments could be seen round the Fort, the e: placement of the mountain gun could be easily distinguished, and also two objects which we took to be the emplacements of the two field guns. All of these in the entrenched line. I requested Shaikh Abdullahjto place the following al ternatives before the Turkish Commandant (a) That he should surrender, when the Officers would be allowed to retain their swords and be treated as indicated in your letter sent bp Abdul Jubbar Effendi. (b) That he should vacate the fort leaving the gunlintact in which case I would hand the Fort over to Shaikh Abdullah, on the latters agreeing to look after the Turks, I insisted on an answer by 7 a .m. the next nornine and Shaikh Abdullah eventually agreed to settle the natter during the night, though he was very anxious to be given ten days for the negotiations. I promised him 5.000/- if he arranged the surrender of him the Fort without a hitch and gave to understand that if he failed the Fort could be taken by H.M's Ships. I may add that the Shaikh was under the impression that 'Dalhousie' was a transport. 5. On the morning of the 20th I landed with Commander Viscount Kelburn. On learning from Shaikh Abdullah that the Turks had fled in the night we proceeded to the Fort which was first occupied by a landing party and searched, and then f o™a41y handed over to Shaikh Abdullah. Besides the three guns in the trenches there were 14 rifles, about 8,000 rounds of ammunition, 500 projectiles, some casks of black powder, tents, great coats and odds and ends of stores in the Fort. Three old muzzle loaders hadII had also been used for revetraentB. The cordite charpoB for the guns and the breech blocks had been removed. At ShalV A &gt;xiullah , s request I gave him the rifles and unfortunately promised him all the rifle ammunition. Shortly after this a blue-jacket discovered 106 cases of mauser ammunition in a magazine situated about 100 yards.away. I handed this over to the Shaikh subject j^o- your approval. 6. ' Dalhousie' sai^d 2for Gharbar that afternoon ani. 'Pyramus 11 for Bahrain. The Commander, however^ received a - signal from the Senior Naval Officer that evening directlnfr him to search the Tangistan Coast for dhows after dropping me at Bahrain. As I had received information that the Tang- siri dhovfl were probably ahelterinr,in the Shibki h Ooast, as 'pyr^mus' was xloBXjE; nhort of coal2 and had not a trust* worthy interpreter, I suggested that the Commander should search the Coast first and land me at Bushire. We according ly proceeded to Has Bandan where we searched several boats, but without discovering any from Tangistan and then worked up the coast to near 1 an«Jun when a dust storm and heavy sea put a stop to our operations. -From information received, I came to the conclusion that the Tangsiri boats were sheltering behind Jabrin Inland and in the Mana Kiver. _ X have the honour to be, 1 lilr.

Buohiro. ✓ '1 Dated bus/ire, the ^^September 4 1915. r % Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I left Bushire in H.: .S^Pyramus' in the evening of the August 28th. '^yrarrus' anchored off Madumari fr the evening of the 29th and I went away with the First Lieutenant in the 'Edward Ross' which had been fitted with a 3 pounder to reconnoitre. 3 dhows were discovered in the beach opposite Madimari and were destroyed by shell fire from the 'Edward Roas r , while some men from Dilwar and Madumari who were taking interest in our proceedings were dispersed by shell fire from 'Pyramus'. 2. During the rest of the day I boarded several dhows Mem*. which were stopped by 'Pyrarcus'. of them proved to be Tangisiri boats / and no useful information was obtained. 3. On August 30th 'Pyraraus' anchored off the mouth of the ^and River and I proceeded with the Commander in the 'Nearchus 1 ' motor cutter with two maxims and about 20 armed men to reconnoitre the river. The bar has about 7 feet of water at high tide and thts river is for the first 6 miles about 100-120 yeards wide with flat low banks covered with low scrub. I landed twice to tal&lt; to f isheriaen^ and learnt that there wers some Tangfciil boats at and near the village of Ziarat. I was also informed that several men from Ziarat had joined Rais Ali in his attacks on Bushire. The banks of the river rise to about ilfrom 6 foot at about 7 milss/faK the mouth. At about 8 mi lei we pasaod a large ooean going dhow which a fisherman informed me waa a Tangairi. go*' As I considered it Jburt to interview the headmen of t e villages before taking any aotio^we hoisted a white flag and proceeded further up the river, but within 200 yards of the dhow fire was opened on us from the bank by a few men well concealed in the scrub. The only men visible were from 200 to 300 yards away. Their fire was si by a maxim, and we then returned to the dhow and di her with a charge of gun-cotton and burnt a smaller which was a little lower down. Six more dhows wer near Ziarat, but there were probably several more the date palms. There were no casualties. 4. In the afternoon we proceeded to Ras-al-Khan which was reported to contain Tangsiri dhows. 3 of the 4 boats in the anchorage had satisfactory papers, but, we observed the crew of the fourth dhow bolting with some of theifar be longings on their backs, and the Bushirft crew of another boat stated that the boat was fror Tangistan. I sent a man'after them informing them that if they did not return within half an hour I would have their dhow burnt. They did;' not return, and the boat was accordi/igly burnt 5. On August 31st 'Pyramus' anchored^'ukhailah Island f Wnl and I accompanied a reconnaissance of the shoal water behind some sand banks and islands which are not marked in the Chart, but without finding any Tangsiri boats. 6. On September Ist ,, Pyramus ,, anchored off Dilwar, and the 'Edward Ross' with a 3 pounder and the motor cutter with a maxim were sent away to destroy 2 dhows which appeared to be above high tide level opposite Ua»okh some distarce above Dilwar. On landing we discovered that the dhows were up a creek some 400 yards inland; and before the landing party had proceeded 100 yards fire was opened on them by some 20 or 30 men well concealed, probably in As it was certain that the demolition party would suffer heavy ■ »s. , mfli haavy loan in advancing across the open, a withdrawal was effocted covered bytke maxim of the motor cutter, the 3 pounder of the 'Edward Rosb 1 * and the 4' guns of 'Pyramus^ the latter firing at 7,900 yards. There were no casualties among the landing party, but a few T^.ngairis were accounted for by 'Pyramua ,,, fire. One dhow was then destroyed by the 3 pounder, and the second partially disabled when a rising sea made further effective practice impossible. 7 # The total during the four days has been 7 dhows destroyed and two partially disabled, and it has been es tablished that practically all the Tangsiri dhows on the coast are up the i-and River. 8. In my opinion an expedition up the Mand River is Ct* quite practicable, and should results/the destruction of at least 6 Tangsiri dhows. After a careful reconnaissance I put the minimum jy*-, force required at a landing party of 100 men w the right bank, 25 men in reserve in case of a landing being neces sary pi the left bank, and the necessary gun and maxim crews and boat-keepers. The 'Nearchus ,,l motor cutter which was kindly placed at out disposal by Commander Salmond was of the greatest use. She is an ideal craft for this sort of work, and I consider that the success of an expedition up the ?'and River would largely depend on the provision of at least 2 steam boats of shallow draught or motor cutters, similar to her. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Major, Political Agant, Bahrain. /■ 4 I - s - A f -k ■' Meraorandun. From KoyecJ, P.A. Bahrain. To Trevor, O.3.D. BusMre.

'it will be seen that the 6. Copy of« notice 'Communique of the Volautjers ' posted &lt;.• i i in Bushireabout 26th July iyi5. I articles^ are all virulently i^anti-British in tone. The w riter of the article in the ' Jam-i-Jam ', No. 18, is Mahommed Reza Derisi, a 'well-known pro-German agitator of Busbire, who was recently smuggled out of Bushire by the gendarmes when the Governor was on the point of arresting and deporting him. Mahommed Reza's style of writing is, I understand, unmistakeable to the educated Persian, but in any case the last sentence of the article gives away that he is the author, as the sa ne phrase was used in a draft article sent from Wassmuss's camp as from a Bushire correspondent' which recently fell in to our hands. The ^ Jam-i-Jam' is a paper started and subsidised by Wassmuss and maintained chiefly by subscriptions of his friends and adherents. The ' Tazianeh ' is, I think, slightly more independent, but also no doubt receives a subsidv from Wassmuss, which helps it to eke out a precarious existence. Enclosure No. 1, Extract from the ' Jam-i-Jam', iVo. 17, dated the 7th Ramzan 1333 {20th July 1915). Fighting has taken place between Zair Khidhar Khan, Shaikh Muhammad (Husain ?) Khan, Z:\bit of Chahkutah and Ahmedi and Kais Ali Dilwari, to whom the credit of ali the victories should be given, on the one side and the English. The Commandant of British forces who had the rank of a Major, and his assistant having the rank of a Captain have been killed with one hundred men while some men have been wounded. As Rais Ali had taken precautions, no one has been killed or woundei on his side.I I 23 -f* 11' I » 1 j . Enclosure No. 2. Supplement to the 'Jam-i-Jam', No. 18, dated the Uth Ramzan 1383 (-2 7th July 1915), entitled 'The situation in the South'. The present position or proofs of the weakness of the English. Before we inform our compatriots of the present situation, we will tell them briefly the relations of individuals among the people, and of the Chiefs in the South with the English. So far as we can say with certainty, the English considered themselves not only the Governor and Ruler in the South, but the humble conduct and slave-like action of the Chiefs had given them such confidence that they considered themselves without trouble the owner of all the South. In India where they had been labouring for 150 years, and where they had used armed fcrce at the time of occupation, still when an Officer or Head was going to visit the villages on inspection, in spite of the fact that there is not a man with a rille in India, they considered it imperative for themselves to start with a certain force, lest danger would befall them. But in these parts it has been often seen that a single man, Mr. Chick, the Vice-Consul, has started with a handbag and a single sowar from Bushire entered all Dashti and Dashtistan, which are all armed and are the warlike people of the South, even into the nomad tribes, and found that he was respected and esteemed in every way. While, in order to show the valour ?ind prowess of his cunning Government,^ such villages like Dilwar were being bombarded for the sake of a single unworthy and unimportant Tangistani, and a trivial accusation, yet in the same way he was visiting alone Borasjun, Chahkutah and even Behbehan. Apparently no one had the ability to think over the matter. But at present this state of things and the previous effects have undergone such changes and the people, high and low, have taken up such a hostile attitude that, without exaggeration, if they land four thousand men with numerous puns to Bushire, they will not be able to take a step beyond the first tower of Muqam, the extreme end of Bushire. AVe have seen the reason of this. Ever since they tried to dishonour the Persians, arrested and expelled the Germans in Bandar Rig and Bushire, contrary to.the neutrality of Persia, and attacked the house of Eaji Ali of Tamgak and there were rumours of unity among the chiefs of J)ashti and Dashtistan with a view to reprisals, not a single officer has been able to leave Bushire, in spite of the fact that they had landed one thousand men at Bushire to defend themselves, and with the help of the traitor, Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh, had placed many guns in such positions as were necessary and made strong sangars. They saw very well that the German Consul was sometimes at Ahram, 8 farsakjis from Bushire, and another time at Shamshiri, 6 farsakhs, and finally 15 days at Gurak, 4 farsakhs from Bushire, and was being kept by the Tangistanis, vho were openly showing themselves as the enemies of the English, particularly during his stay at Shamshiri and in the first days of his stay at Gurak there were not more than 40-50 tufargchis, yet they were unable to take a step from Bushire and take such illegal action* as they were wont to do. Agha Shaikh Ilussain Khan, Chahkutahi, who formerly was their great and close friend, seeing that religion w r as concerned, at once declared himself on hostile terms with them, and showed opposition to them and became the founder of the combination in the South. ■The Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, who was always known for his moderation joined hands with the confederates, although he showed weakness afterwards. ItoweA er, as he has now perceived their weakness with his own eyes, he is hotly bent upon revenge and the preservation of his honour. At present, the persons among the Khans in Dashti, Dashtistan and the Ports w ho shows himself in favour of the English is liaidar Khan, the traitor and .Muwaqcjar-ud-Douleh, the offender, and none else. Although Ismail Khan jn reply to those respected gentlemen, who had come from Kazerun to maket r ^ &gt;' 2&lt;t peace, showed himself as assisting the English, yet his attitude is like that of a two days' old guest. Those who have become courageous in their sin and notorious, and who are ready to sacrifice themselves even with their lives in assisting the English, are those two traitors. The English have of late hit on a good plan. As they are convinced that tliey cannot defend themselves with their present force against the con federates they have tried to curtail the forces of confederates, and to keep them occupied on one side. The plan is that ever since the unity of the volunteers in the South, Agha Khan, Ismail Khan's son-in-law, had secretly allied himself with the confederates, and, as for many years past, there has been enmity hetwen Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh and Ismail Khan, and the former ^ is also a member of the alliance ; Ismail Khan therefore wanted to give a lesson to Agha Khan, and even to get rid of him once for all. But as he saw the lorces of the confederates and Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneli with him, he did not think that he was able to do so. The English perceived his difficulty, gave him assurances of their assistance through Ilaidar Khan and showed all sorts of co-operation and thereby got him to attack Agha Khan. Ismail Khan at once occupied Cham-i-Darwahi, one of the particular villages of Agha Khan, and surrounded his villages with troops. Haidar Khan's forces were also sent to assist, and about two thousand men attacked Agha Khan, who thus was in dire stress. The Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, in accordance with the alliance, sent troops with the result that 40 men have been killed and wounded from both sides up to present. However, much the Governor-General'of Ears gave counsel and used threats, it had no effect; it is only right because ' the fish is putrid from its head and not from its tail and all these cries are made by the Shah ' (i.e., there is a gigantic force behind them all). They (the British) are the men who have instigated this trouble and sedition and as long as they are not stopped, they will not hold their hands. In the meantime, the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and the traitor to Persia, Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh, under instructions from the English, sent a 8-centemetre gun to Shief to assist Ismail Khan, which meant a triumph for Haidar Khan, and the defeat of the confederates. You should now see what an extraordinary state of things results. Persons who have committed all sorts of treason towards their Government, and _ their i - nation and religion, are to be given a gun, while those persons who have joined the hands of fraternity and brotherhood with each other are despised and condemned 1 Hurrah for the diplomacy of the Government authorities! Still we should thank His Excellency M ukhbir-us-Suitaneh, who, having received news of the arrival of the gun, immediately issued an order to the gendarmerie that the Government gun was not to intervene in operations, and that it was to be used against the party which refused to make peace. He ordered the gendar merie at once to seize the gun, and to use it against any party which may refuse to make peace. As soon, however, as the news of the arrival of the gun reached the Tangistanis and Chahkutahis, they also at once proceeded to take measures and are at present engaged in sending contingents. A part of them has already arrived at Borasjun. They claim someting more. They say that they should extirpate Haidar Khan, the traitor, according to their first agreement. If the Government wanted to punish him, it would have done so and would not have treated him in this way. At present fighting is in progress and the front gets wider and wider day by day. It is not known it the gun which has arrived will be easily surrendered to the gendermerie. If the Tangistanis get ready with all their force, they will totally annihilate Haidar Khan and his followers. The night is pregnant and we should see what the morning brings forth (i .e., there is somethiny progressing, we should see the result). # # JSf. i?.—This last sentence is the same as that used in the other article in .■ the handwriting of Mu-hammad lleza Herisi, which recently came into our hands. .M I fVEnclosure No. 3, Extract from the 0 Tazianeh No, 24, dated the 6th Ramzan 1333. The pressure and intrigues of the English. The silence of the Government against all their illegal transgressions has filled the cup of the Persians* patience to the brim, and the volunteers of XMshti, Dashtistan, Chahkutah and Tangistan, who have for some time past nuited in obedience to the decrees of the High Ulema for the preservation of the realms of Islam have attacked the British Consulate-General at Bushire. Although they were being constantly fired at from the sea and land, they did not fear death and attacked so enthusiastically in the cause of the preserv ation of the Sacred Law that two officers and five Indian sowars were killed, their arms were carried away ; other numbers of the killed and wounded in the bangurs of the enemy are unknown. The volunteers had no casualties and returned to their places according to the order of the Commander. According to a telegram from Borasjun the artillery fire of the British, continues on the place where the volunteers were.

Copies to the Kazeruni Mujtahid, Agha Sayyed Jafar, Agha Shaikh Jafar,, Agha Shaikh Murteza, Agha Shaikh Muhsin, the Qawam-ul-Mulk, the Supreme Court of Justice, the Gendarmerie Department, the ' Jam-i-Jam the Tazianehthe Socialist Moderates, and the holy committee of the Democrats, Shiraz. With a view to preserving the prestige of Islam and independence of the dominions of Persia and to blocking the paths for the pretexts and intrigues of the foreigners and to the delicate positioa of neutrality merely for the sake of God,. w 7 e volunteered to make peace between the Khans of Dashtistan and we made up our minds at Kazerun to remove by whatever means the antagonism on both sides and to get them to conclude peace and unite sincerely with each other, and to guard against the critical situation, and to get them to assist in the execution of the Government's orders. We divided ourselves in two parties, and some of us visited the Gh^zanfar- us-Sultaneh, while the other one, the Chief one, visited Ismail Khan. We made a truce of hostilities for the time being. We were first under the im pression that the tiame of the trouble was perhaps actuated by a desire on the part of both parties to acquire each other's territories. After obtaining full, information regarding the geography of the territories of both sides, we put iorward the terms of peace. Indeed Agha Khan and Ghazanlar-us-Sultaneii and the other Khans allied with them accepted them, and showed themselves ready to unite with each other and not to allow the intrigues of foreigners to shake the neutrality of the Peisian Government. Although Ismail Khan at first was ready to make peace, but unfortunate ly Muhammad Khan of ilaiat Daud, who had come with his forces under instructions from Haidar Khan to assist him, seduced the latter with the help of Mr. Cox, and his own co-operation. He ignored our peaceful measures and sincere efforts and relused to make peace. The poor fool has been won over by the force of the rifles and ammunition of the British. We did not at all lose any opportunity to elfect peace, but to our regret it had no eUcct and we liave now arrived at Borasjun m despair.2G Tlie Gbazanfar-ns-Sultaneh showed due hospitality to us. It is necessary for us to bring to the notice of the Government authorities what we have learnt of the ' philosophy ' of this dispute. It is our conviction from the outward and inward signs of the fighting that Haidar Khan and Ismail Khan have no other object than the furtherance of the objects of the foreigners in the South. And if Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh and Agha Khan fall in with them in their policy of worshiping foreigners, they will not spare their assistance. Further, Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, Agha Khan and other Khans of Dashti and Dashtistan are most willingly ready to afford them (Ismail Khan and his friends) any assistance. This is the history of our visit and the result of our trouble and our impartial investigation. Of course the Government authorities are alive to their duties and aware of the facts of this plan. Yerily this is the true story. (Sd.)

Enclosure No. 5. Telegram. Extract from the ' Tazianeh', No. 25, dated the 9th Eamzan 1333; (22nd July 1915J. To His Royal Highness Ain-ud-Daijleh , Tehran. Your esteemed telegram addressed to the Khans, Zair Khidhar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan of Chahkutaii has been received and caused great astonishment and regret; because now that God Almighty has granted us an opportunity to restore the honour and former losses of Persia, the authorities holding the reins of Government have sat still with folded handsnot only have they not taken any action to improve the state of affairs, but they are deceiving the' nation with phrases such as ' th&amp; necessary steps' and are secretely aidrUg the enemies of our country. Every patriot will interpret such telegrams only as partiality towards the enemies of religion and our home, and against the feelings of the nation. Such a meaning for the word ' neutrality' has not been found in any dictionary. For several years past the north and south of our country have been occupied by the troops of our enemies and they have taken all kinds of steps in this crisis to crush our independence. Do we consider ourselves still independent, and able to give orders for neutrality or intervention ? The wise of the nation have understood very well that if the Government authorities were able or willing to preserve their honour, they would have shown signs of this during the last 12 or 13 months, especially when our guests were robbed. It has been clearly visible that the traitors and followers of the enemies of this country have always been the object o£ kindness; but a communitv which has united in order to maintain the honour of their Government and nation have been misrepresented as (disturbers of peace) and their action as an historical disgrace. We inform you plainly that the duty of the nation is first to obey the religious leaders, and we also, in accordance with the decrees of the Proofs of Islam and the leadership of our leaders, have prepared ourselves for Jeha#27 with a view to removing tlie aggressions and high-handedness of at Bushire and the traitors to the country. Our object is, firstly, the expulsion of the British troops and, secondly, the restoration of the Germans. Nobody has any right to restrain ns in our objects, and we consider those who obstruct us as apostates from the religion. The Government authorities, who follow the same religion as we do, should support us according to wisdom and the laws of Shara ! If in reality the opinion of the Government is constitutionally against the feelings of the nation, they should warn us distinctly so that we may know that we are under the enemies of our country, and that we may fully fulfil our duties.

Murteza Hisaini. Editorial Note hy the ' Tazianch', There is the flame of the fire at Bushire, and here is this terrible epidemic on this side. Has not yet the time arrived when the Governor- General should look to his duties ? Was it not possible for you (the Governor- General) to send such experienced respected personages whose words bear effect and who have been imprisoned here, as the aged and famous Sardar (General) Darya Begi born for such a purpose so that at least he might follow up the effects of the mission from Kazerun, with a view to putting out this wide-spreading fire ? Enclosure No. 6. COMMUNIQUE OE THE VOLUNTEERS. At a time when the organisations of the forces of the volunteers were not completed, a party of 100 men in their ardent desire, without the permission of the Commanding Officer, had voluntarily attacked Sabzabad on the af ternoon of the 30th Sha'aban (14th July) and reached the door of the latter place and the walls of Tangak in an attack. Although there was constant firing from the ship and the land trenches, they had no casualties and they gallantly killed two British officers and 12 Indian sepoys who had come out and carried off their arms. 'While they were engaged in ousting the Indian sepoys from the trenches, the news reached the headquarters. As this trivial action was not with the approval of the Commandant, a sowar was sent with orders calling them back. They were very offended and thought that if they had been allowed to continue I their operations for another two hours, they would have occupied Sabzabad and Tangak. It is a matter for surprise that, when even the small party had departed back to Gurak 4 hours after sunset on the night of the 1st Ramzan (13tli July), the English were constantly firing from the ship and laud up to 4 hours after sunrise on the following day, the Ist Ramzan. Strange to say, the English were all in an anxious mood, because according to local news from Bushire one shell from the ship had struck the Telegraph Office and another one Sabzabad, the Consulate, demolishing two pillars in the Telegraph buildings and a part of the stairs in the Consulate. These acts are evidently the outcome of their careless measures resulting from their des-* peration. (A small attack without the information of the headquarters.) Jsotice placarded in Bushire about 26th July 1915.28 65 No, 1440, dated Rushire, the 9th (received 16th) August 1915. From— M ajor A. P. T hevob, C .I .E., OfReer on Special Duty in the Persian Gulf Residency, Bushiie (in the absence of the Resident), To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. In continuation and amplification of ray telegram, 398 C., dated 8th August ]915, I have the honour to report, for the information of the Govern ment of India, that the occupation of iiushire town was successfully carried out at daylight yesterday by the 11th Rajputs under the command of Lieuten ant-Colonel D. G. Stuart The arrangements were made by the Officer Commanding Tooops, Bushire, Lieutenant-Colonel li. P. Lane, after consulta tion with the Senior Naval Odicer and myself. The 11th Rajputs marched off from Bushire at 3-15 a.m ., and reached the south end of the town at 5 a m. Here the regiment divided and parties were sent to the Customs, Governor's house, barracks and Gendarmerie barracks. All these points were occupied without opposition. There was a slight hitch in the Gendarmerie barracks, as the officer begged for permission to go and get the Governor's orders. He arrived at the Governor's house when I was there, interviewing His Excellency about the occupation of Bushire, so I arranged with the Governor that he should tell the officer to vacate at once and leave for Borasjun with his men as had been suggested to him. The officer duly received those instructions and, after his return to town, vacated the barracks and marched otf with his men to JVlugam, on the Shiraz road at the Alashileh. There he picked up the men, who had been in the Tower at Mugam and who had been turned 9ut of the Tower at daylight by the Officer Commanding outposts, and the whole party left for Borasjun. When the party which occupied the Governor's house was searching the place, 148 rifles (Mausers, Martinis, Ross, &amp;c,) were found and 102 boxes of ammunitiou. The British flag was hoisted at the Custom House, the Governor's house and the Turkish Consulate. The hoisting of the British flag on the large Persian flagstaff at the back of the town near the old Government House had to be deferred as there were no halyards and the other rigging was rotten; steps are being taken to rectify this. H. M V S. Dalhousie ' came into the inner anchorage after dark on the evening of the 7th instant and lay off the town; on the morning of the 8th a party was sent to seize the Customs Gunboat Muzaffar', and the two armed, launches ' Azerbaijan ' and ' Mazandaran This was succesfully carried out, the second launch is useless at present having had her engines taken out. The Persian Telegraph Office was at first occupied and then dismantled and a guard put over the Persian Post Office. A guard was at first put on the Turkish Consulate, but afterwards the few records there are, were sealed up and the guard withdrawn. • According to previous arrangement I called on His Excellency the Gov ernor at G-30 a. m . the earliest hour which I should be likely to find him up, and informed him of what His Majesty's Government had decided and told him that Bushire had been taken over by t]iat time. It was a complete surpiise to him (as to everybody else) as I had arranged that the regiment should on its way to town take over the country telephone exchange to prevent people in town communicating the news to the Governor or others outside. The exchange in town was also occupied directly the regiment arrived there. His Excellency was very bitter and pointed out to me (as I knew before) that his friendly attitude towards us had brought him into such bad odour with the Persian Government, the Governor-General of Pars and the people generally that he dare not go to his house in Shiraz, and asked what he should do. I replied that there were two alternatives; one was for His Excellency to go to Bunder Abbas or Lingah and carry out the Government of the remainder of the Gulf Ports from there, and the other was to go to India or29 Europe on leave. His Excellency replied that as I was aware he had not received any pay for two months, nor had his stiff. I answered that this could probably be arranged. He then said that he could not make any move without telegraphing to the Persian Government as to do so would confirm them in the view which they would certainly take that the occupation had been a prearranged matter between himself and us. I accordingly agreed that he might telegraph to the Persian Government mentioning that possibly their suggestion would not be acceptable to us. I informed His Excellency that he might receive his friends, etc., at his country house, but that I regretted that it was impossible to permit him to go to town. At the close of the interview, when conducting me across the courtyard, His Excellency remarked ' my friends always told me that something of this sort would happen if i worked with the English,' and with this, a rather unpleasant interview terminated I may say that I think that His Excellency exaggerated the amount of assistance he has pi yen to us, and that 1 do not trust him v-ry much myself. Later in the day His Excellency was further agitated by exaggerated reports of the rough treat ment given to his furniture and other property in the town house by the sepoys who occupied the place. From enquiries I have made, I think that the party was perhaps rough, quite unwittingly, through considering the place more as if it w ere a captured enemy stronghold instead of merely the house of a Governor of a friendly (?) being temporarily occujjied. Later in the morning Monsieur Bourgeois came in to town and called upon me. He agreed to carry on the work and has since got practically all the stall' to sign an agreement to serve us. He is behaving in a very satisfac tory manner and giving every assistance. All he asked was that if he got into any difficulties with the Persian Government, we would recommend him lor the Chinese Maritime Customs. I replied that I could not make any promises as to whether the Government would be able to recommend him to the Chinese Maritime Customs Department or whether the latter would con-? sider him a suitable man, but I thought it possible that if he worked well here, something could be done for him in that direction. Early in the morning of the 8th I issued a brief proclamation based on Foreign Department telegram No. 680, dated 17th July, giving the reasons for the occupation of Bushire; and subsequently notices prohibiting people going about armed, and indiscriminate firing either by day or night, etc. I have arranged that Abdur Basul, who was previously Kalantar of Bushire in the Darya Begi's days, will again act as Kalantar frem the 1st of next (Mubammadan) month. Up to the time of writing every tiling has been quite quiet and as far as can be seen at present there is reason to hope that the place will remain quiet. 1 ■ m - v I! fl vy / 32 67 Telegram P., No. 852 S., dated the 19th Auguet 1915.

The cable connection between Bandar Big and Bushire, which has been suggested, would be useless for communication with Tehran and Shiraz, as at Borasjun, which is hostile to us, the Indo-European Telegraph and Bandar Big line join. An alternative line would be provided by the proposal between Bushire and Basrah, but, as we already have wireless and cable connection, this is not essential. To locating a cable guard at Bandar Rig there is also objection for this might excite hostile Khans to action and involve our either withdrawing guard or reinforcing it. 71 Telegram P., No. S. 855, dated the 20th August 1915.

I ordered them to move to the right under cover and fix . bayonets and charge; this they did at about 10.30 a.m. add drove enemy about 600 in number out on to the Ilashileh. The cavalry then charged through them. All my guns then came up to the edge of the cliffs and pursued the enemy with their fire for about 4000 yards, the infantry following them to the edge of Mashileh.

Do you think anything could be done about this boom if report is correct? Or would it be necessary to ask Senior Naval Officer to send 'Lawrence' over? Our report further states that all the dhows destroyed by 'Pyramus' were'enemy' dhows except one which belonged to Lawar in Dashti, which belongs to Hussain Khan of Dashti with whom we are at present negotiating, did you see anything of this, or do you think it is in correct? Reports received yesterday that Rais Ali Dilwari was killed here on the night of 3rd/4th leading a raid again&amp;t one of the Tangak posts.

Condition of affairs at and near Borasjun is obviously intolerable and its continuance threatens to involve Kashgai and other tribes from further (?) inland. Immediate punishment of expedition would undoubtedly be most satisfactory method of dealing with situation, but as pointed out by Your Excellency in your telegram No. 105 to Government of India aggressive action on our part at this moment would almost certainly set whole of Southern Persia in a blaze and would certainly render position of British subjects (in) Shiraz and perhaps at Ispahan very precarious. P. A . j F?) ctAx A .f-O.■ V 42 As regards Shiraz, I am of opinion that, conld present Governor-General be recalled and Kawara appointed, it would be possible for him to keep Ears quiet whilst we dealt with hostile Khans as seemed best to us and I think in this case few if any Kashgai would join in confederacy. I venture, therefore, to submit opinion that for the present our policy should be confined to encouraging friendship of Khans with all possible moral and material help and by arranging with Sheikh of Mohammerah to despatch force to be ready to support Ismail Khan when required. And that as soon as situation in Fars has assumed more satisfactory complexion we should ourselves organize such punitive measures as seem necessary. Addressed Tehran j repeated to Bushire.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Kegarding the occupation of Bushire. Yesterday after three hours' conversation Prime Minister said that our conditions would be agreed to in principle by him, though he took exception to amount of indemnity and suggested a procedure as follows ;—Persian authority restored at Bushire and Governor-General, Ears, to be recalled simultaneously, Persian Government to pledge itself to put an end to German agitations and to punish Khans implicated in attack as soon as possible. Our troops to remain until danger of further attack is passed. I mentioned that I had no hope that such terms would be accepted by His Majesty's Government, but that they would, before terminating formal occupation, certainly insist on removal of Governor-General. Proposal is otherwise worth considering. In the south Governor-General Las been chief instrument of German agitation and in Persian eyes, his removal will be a decided blow to them. Consul, Shiraz, always puts his removal as most important point. Of course the other (?) promises are valutless, as Government are absolutely powerless to fulfil them and their hold is moreover very precarious. However, it may last long enough to get rid of Governor-General. Our effect, on the other hand, continues and we are relieved of the nuisance of having to administer Bushire while the irritation is removed of foreign relations all over Persia at hauling down of Persian flag. Would His Majesty's Government agree to this proposal modified as follows:—That at Bushire Persian authority is not restored until Governor- General has definitely left and Kawam-ul-Mulk appointed as Acting Gov ernor-General of Ears; with regard to selection of two new Governors of Shiraz and Bushire Legation to be consulted. 96 Telegram R., No. 506 C., dated the 29th (received 30th) August 1915.

Ma^or T.Keyoa, Political Agent, Bahrain, Major A.P.Trovor, G.I.E., I.A. # On Special Duty, Biuihire. September 22th;, 19X6* I have the honour to report th^t I arrested Yusuf Fakhru yestorctay. Shal}:h Isa gave me all tftftlst* -ance necessary for searching his houses, storehouses anrl shops; and Yusuf Fa&gt;:h2ru himself was very amenable and franh. All the documents taken have not been examined, but he has been able to prove from his account booKs and letter book that the three sailing vessels about the ownership of which there was some doubt have, for over a year, been hio bona fide property. Tangsiris originally held shares in those boats, but he has gradually bought then out. a. I have so far obtained no evidence us to any political dealings with Tangsiris, and am inclined to believe that he has confined himself to selling them good§ which are, of course, smuggled, and to bu/ing ir^ln and wood from them. There are also, so far, no traces of any poll- -tical dealings ^ith the Germans, and I do not anticipate that I shall fin 1 any. The only evidence we have to go on in this matter is contained in Herr Harling's letter which were taken away by the Intelligence Officer, Yusuf Fakhru, though he,was Herr Harling's go between in his attempt to Interfere with the landing-of the troops. • &gt;ill was not WoncKnaus 1 agent in Huharraq, but meroly their chlQl' custoraer there. The only documents bearing on political netters which have been discovered are three letters from the Turk- -Ish Commandant at Doha diving news and asking for loans, which were not given. 3, When Yusuf FaKhru was fined Rs: 4,500 by Ca tain UacXenzle for dealing in arms he was described as a friend of ShalXh Isa's and a merchant of influence dealing in two lakhs. I think his influence with Shaikh Isa has declined since I showed the Shaikh translations of Herr Harling's reports, but he has a large number of friends here. In view of the fact th t he has cleared himself of the charge of sheltering sTangslrl boats unde^a fictitious ownership, that his connection with the Germans comparatively ancient history, and that his pwoer to do damage in this direction has now ceased, I do not think that it is advlsabB to imprison him in Basra. In iay opinion it will be suff- -icient to take security of Rs: 35,COO from him that he will not allow himself to be involved in any political business with Germans, Tangsirls or other enemies of ours. The fright and warning should be sufficient, and Shaikh Isa, who has behaved very wel} in the matter, would appreciate our refraining from imprisoning an influential subject of his. The fact of his arrest and of his being sent to Basra will be known in Tanglstan in a very short time and will have a good effect. 4. I hope that you will telegraph and Inform the Resident that Yusuf Fakhru is travelling by the slow mail under escort, asking that, when taken over by the !.illtar authorities, he may be treated , not as a prisoner of war but as a respectable merchant under detention, and that he should be allowed to return on signing a bond for fz.53 Translation of a letter flated the 19th Phil Qad 1553 29th September 1915. Shaikh Qasim bin Mahza Chief Qazi of Bahrain to Major T.H.Keyes, Political Agent, Bahrain. oOo I have received your letter and understood its contents. I know quite well how busy you are on mail days. But possessing the knowledge I do, I do not wish that the least thing may happen contrary to your justice. Today since the morning I have been busy with large numbers of people who came to visit me. Each of them gave vent to the grief felt at what has happened to Yusuf Fakhru and the severity with which he is being treated and express -ed what a shock the incident has caused to the subjects of the country. When my ears became tired by the recital of their grief and I rose from my Court and asked for an interview with you; but, as it could not be arranged, I therefore say that you are in- effieient in diplomacy. You are supreme in your position. Your orders are not to be disobeyed. You can pass such orders as will prevent Yusuf Fakhru from doing what you do not like and from interfering in the politics of your Government in future. What is Yusuf Fakhru but under your orders, as he is neither a Govern ment nor an agent of your enemy. Why should you use a stick in place of ^ words and a sword in place of a stick and thus efcouisi disturb and hurt the feelings of the subjects and of their Ruler, while your object could be gained by the one word from you. Do you wish to sow the seeds of enemity for you in the hearts of J peaceful subjects. They will attribute harshness to you. Before this they have never received such a thing from you. Your honour and your office know that I am a fast and sincere friend and in all matters I proclaim your justice very loudly. Verily I have given evidence about your justice after thoroughly acquainting myself with your way of administration. I have always found it to be on the lines of righteousness. Justice, clemency and Kindness You may therefore accept my advice in this matter as I am with you and for you.

After ComplimentB, I am glad that you have written to me about Yuauf Fakhroo as it gives me an opportunity of explaining to you and all ot'hers who have interested themselves in his oaee how the matter stands. : j It is not hidden from you that the Germans have been preparing for this war for many years. One of their plans was to raise trouble in all countries in which the British are interested so as to keep as many British troops as possible occupied away from the battle line in Europe. Tn their plan they did not consider the ultimate destruction of the people they were leading into trouble. Even Bahrain did not escape attention. Part of their plan was when trouble had been caused in Basra to raise the Tangsiris against Rushire and to blpe them on to plunder Bahrain. Let your mind go back a little to the history of the Tangsiris. They make their living by smuggling goods and rifles, and even engage in piracy. The plan of the Germans was not altogether foolish from their point of view, but they did not reckon withI with the speedy extinction of their froic all Beaa. Had British ships not been free to police the Gulf think how the boats of the divers and tawashes would have fared this year with the Tangsiris being urged on by the Gerrmns • Yusuf Fakhru, who wan sore against the British owing to his having been fined for arms running, acted as an agent for the German in certain political matters. It is probable that he did not know the extent of the German plot, or that the Tangsiris were to be employed to cause trouble here; but he was also an agent for the Tangsiris and helped them in their unlawful smuggling ventures. It therefore became necessary, on the receipttaf certain information to make ^ and further enquiries,/! was therefore ordered to arrest him and send him for enquiry. He has now signed a bond for R8 .25,000/- under taking never again to engage in political intrigues. It is probable that the Resident will accept this and will send him back at once. All people should take this warning to heart. By entering into an intrigue with the Germans he was endangering his own country and the trade of all merchants here. It was only by the vigilance of the British that this evil was averted. Thank God there is still peace in Bahrain. Let all people be careful that they do nothing to endanger this. This is what had to be said may you be preserved and salams. I political Agent, Bahrain. Major, r s.B A H R A IN. 30:IX:15 I wrot© a report about Yu^ur Fa'hru which you will geVoy post, but, as there have toeen developments since, I am sending this by AitKen, and aslcing him to have it telephoned out to you, in case you are not in Town. Yusuf FaXhru has quite established his innocence of the charge of protecting Tangsiri boats by fraudulent transfer of ownership, and his papers have proved that he refused to assist the Turlcs in Qatar. There are, of course, no traces of any dealings with the Germans in connection with their political schmemes. He has b en very frank, and has given me every assistance in examining his books. He says that when I explained to Shaikh Isa the connection of the Tangslris with the Gorman scheme, he became alarmed and repented of having had anything to do with them, and consequently has had less to do with the Tangslris than before. From an examination of his books and letter book I have come to the conclusion that tnls is true, and that he has merelv Shaikh Isa has been very stout-hearted for a change, ana has refusedto listen to the howls of the merchants. They besie^ the mosque and drove Shaikh Jas m to despair, till finally he appealed to me to release him. Yusuf Fakhru being Innocent of two of the charges against him, and the third being somewhat ancient history he cant do any more harm as a German agent), j - think t e fright he hns had and a bond for 35,000/ undertaking to keep clear of all political intrigues will be sufxlcient. He has ha^ a and taken goods in exch He has ha-! a thoUA*^ againA ^ r&gt; I nave tax.en the bond. Leniency win have a good effect here now that we have de~ -monstrated that we will not hesitate to arrest an Influent- Bahrain suhject suspected of Intrigue, and ShalKh Isa will appreciate our refraining from Imprisoning one of his subjects Sir Percy la away from Basra,and I partlcularlydontwant Yusuf Fakhru to languish as a prisoner In ^;j.tary custody for an Indefinite time. I have therefore told Sufl t who Is going up on the same ship, that, unless he hears to the contrary from you, he should, on arrival In Basra, Inform Yusuf FaXhru that he Is at liberty to return to Bahrain by the snme ship. Will you. If you approve, try and communicate Blth Sufi on he ship; or, If you disapprove, wire to whoever Is In Basra asKlng the Yusuf FaKhru should be treated as a respectable merchant and not as a prisoner of war.

In accordance with the views expressed therein and in a sub sequent comraunication(of the I50th September) informing me that Yusuf Fakhru had executed a bond for Rs.25,000/-, I communicated with iir•M.A.Soofi before the departure of the slow mail and ins tructed him to release Yusuf Fakhru on arrival at Basrah and to instruct him to return by the same steamer, and advise^ him not to land at Basrah. Susequently noticing that a copy of the letter had gone to the Chief Political Officer at Basrah, I telegraphed to the deputy Chief Political Officer telling him what I had done and giving him the gist of your last communication, in case any contre^temps should occur. 1 The matter was isax thus satisfactory arranged and the Deputy Chief Political Officer informs me that Yusuf Fakhru is returning by the steamer which takes this. I am very glad to hear that Shaikh Isa acted so firmly in the matter and did nol^allow himself to be swayed by the outcry of the merchants. I am sure Sir Percy Cox would be too, o^ly as he is up at the front at Kut-el-Amara, I have not been able to tell him. If you think fit, you might tell Shaikh Isa this.

Your letter of November 6th: about Tanglstanl boate. SnaiKM laa has isuuect the nscesBary Instructions. Since then the nly boat that has come in was from La war. On my return Armour told me that Mirza Ismail had reported to him that during ny absence 5 Tan^lstanl boai.s had come here and returned with large cargoes of tea, that the inon rcre disguised as Arabs, but boasted that they had been In the fighting against us. That Wassmus had offerred a reward for a British Officer etc. etc. Yusuf Kanoo tells me that ChlcX 's friend, Zair Muhammad, had come to him with the snme story with various frills, such as that Kaji Zair Hassan had received a letter from Wassmus, that he had found out that there was very little foundation o tho ^jbry, an! that event- -ually Zair Muhammad had had it written to Bushire by one of G.P.'s clerKs. As far as I can gather, five boats came in during my aosence and took away between them 800 chests of tea. Two were from Bandar Rig, one from Lawar, one from Karri and one from Bui Khair. These last two, which took away the bulk of the tea,were probably enemy boats. The story about Zair Hassan's letter frOB wd&amp;mus is ri.iiculous^, and, on being questioned / Zair Muhammad admitted it was a lie. He is a thoroughly untrustworthy man, and a fool. I have informed the Persian merchants that if I catch any one selling goods to a Tangistan boat without my permlsslai I will see that he does not replenish his stocks from India. ■They seem to realise that I can play the devil with theii trade If they do not pliy the ^nie, 1 dont thlnX any more stuff will ^et thsou^h, but, as you Know, it is hard to find out about boats that sneaK round by Hidd, whore we have £ot several enemies. Will 'you let me Know more exactly who Is f-riendly ? A man in the Lawar boat who comes from Ziarat told me that Ziarat was under Hussain Khan, a nephew of one Jama] nan, who was friendly, the head of the Khanasir of KarKi he called him, but this means nothing to me. He s r (id that ilussain Khan had sent away all the Tan^siri boats from Ziarat, an 1 that they were mostly beached on thei' r own coast no''. Where is Tahiri ? NaKhal Taqi, another place that fre- -quently fi-ures in my reports, is, as far as T remember, in Ras Bandan Bay, and hence friendly.

Zair Ghulum ha I 9 passport signed by &lt;13 son. I thinl; by the way, I ought to have been told that he was sending a deportee to Bahrain.

Lawar is on the Dashti coast, not far from the Khur-i-Ziarat, and is part of the appanage of our friend, Hussaftn Khan of Dashti. Some of the goods might find their way into Tangistan, but presumably a good part of them would be for Hussain Khan's own district. I enclose a list of the boats and owners and Nakhudas ix- belonging to that part of the Dashti coast, which has so far professed friendship towards us. This will be useful to you and the Shaikh's 'Port-officers' in seeing what are friendly vessels, and what not. It was compiled by the Customs Vudir at Lawar, who was specially sent down by the Director of Customs here at our request and that of Hussain Khan in order to watch and control traffic on that coast. The friendly part of the Dashti coast extends from Kalat, the most northern village of Dashti, to the mouth of the Khur- i-Ziaret. Bui Khair is part of the Baraki group of Tangistan ports, consisting of Rustami, Gahi, Khabidu, Salimabadeh, Khurshabi, Amari, Bui Khair, etc. The chief man at Amari professes friend ship, and is known to be an enemy of Zair Khidhar. A Customs Mudir was recently sent there too, and I will try and get you a list of boats authorized to trade to those ports too. Their requirements are not large, and if they want to take away appa rently excessive quantities at any time, please say 'No' to them. The Major T.H.Keyes,I.A., Political Agent, BAHRAIN.r The Khadkhuda of Karri is a friond of the late Rais Ali /in^ hostile. in reply to your questions, Dashti is a very large district, as you know, extending from Kalat to near Kangoon, on the coast, and right across the mountairs. Its nominal overlord is Jamal Khan, an old man of 70 or more who has lost all his influence over his territory and who resides at Khurmuj. Huseain Khan is a cousin of Jamal Khan, and resides at Kaki, up the v and river. For years he has been on bad terms with Jamal Khan, and set up as independent: he has one or two brothers of more activity than the rest of the Dashti Khans, ' Gianasiri' is the term usually applied to people of Dashti residing on the low lands near the coast. Just as 'Tangisiri' is used for Tansistanis living in the coast portion of Tangistan. two We sent down/special envoys to him, before and during the occupation, and he and his Kadkhudas drew up an agreement to have no truck with Wassmuss or Tangistan, and to set about those Dashti chiefs who do assist Tangistan against us, and who also happen to be their own adversaries. So far thouprh he has not done much, he seems to have had a steadying influence on Dashti: and we have sent him ammunition, Tahiri is south of Kangoon, and not in Dashti, It has an Arab-Persian ruler, Shaikh Muhammad Ahmad Khalfan(?), It is a port of some importance for the interior and used in the old days to be quite a big place: merchants even talk of using it to send goods to Shiraz now-a-days, Nakhl Taqi does not affect us here. I send you copies of telegrams exchanged with the Minister at Tehran, from which you will see that the official view now- a-days is that we should stop goods going to the hostile inte rior, and Shiraz. It is no use feeding the enemy. Shiraz merchants, now there is no British bank, donH care a rap who runs the place, it seems, as long as they get their : ^ or which they are hard up, and are able to thrive:(incidently if they get their goods now when the Bank is siasatt shut they pro bably won't pay for them), if they don't get them, they may make a 1x a song about it, and begin to see who really supplies their wants# These telegrams may help you in your watch on car^o leavinir Bahrain, and repressive measured. As regards Zair Ghulam and Zair Hussain I am under the impression that i mentioned to you in a d/o that Haji Zait Hassan said he would take them to Bahrain and be responsible for them.(I had warned these two individuals to leave Bushire during the occupation). Just when this arrangement was made the Military authorities stepped in and deported them and even locked up Haji Z. Hassan for being mixed up with them, rvhen Zair Ghulam got to Basrah, Wilson wanted to release them, and I told him the original arrangement had been to send them to Bahrain in charge of Haji Zair Hassan, and he apparently in tended to adopt this plan; but he ought to have informed you when the man started.I GONFiDtiili riAL • The Residency, Bushire, ??^nd ueoember^T.Ql I anclcse a copy of a letter from the Oustoms Mudir at Lawar, on the uashtj coast, North of the Khur -i -Ziaret, re^rard- ir^ the smuggling of cargoes from Bahrain to the ^angistan coast.

However greatly they have tried and wished to upset the relations between Hussain Khan and the tribes, who are pledged to him, the acfctais attempts of the mischief-makers have been spoilt by the excellent plans of Zair Abdullah ^han and Faqih Muhammad Khan. Up tilljf now the hostile parties have been urging a general peace, so that each one of them should remain, where he lives, and as this course was against the interests of Hussain Khan, i.e. some of his properties were in their hands, he would not agree. On this account there has arisen a little ill-feeling between him and ^aqih Zain-ud-Din: although they hold to their former accord, yet inwardly they are not on good terms, and the hostile parties will soon take advantage of this state of affairs to create lasting ill-feeling between them. At this juncture it is very necsssary that you should assist and show kindness to iiussain Khan: and you should, as quickly as may be despatched for some da^s to Dashti either Zair Abdullah ivhan or Faqih ^uhamnad Khan to arrange natters between them and put a stop to the intrigues o^ the hostile narties. This matter is of the greatest importance, and would be very timely: if this step is delayed, it may be that a^aira, in Dashti may take an irremediable turn, it is very necessary to send either one or the other of them quickly.3.

Dear Treror, I have let myself In for the most abominable amount of worlc by assuming the control $f the tea stocks, but it has enabled me to realise what a lot of boats come and go . All have Persian Customs' papers, but probably some are fa^ed and nearly all are illegible. One thing is certain that the Khur Ziarat, or Mand River, is still their place of refuge and base for distributing goods. In your D .o. of 6th: Nov- % • -ember you told me that Hussain Khan runs the country as far M Mand River, The village and anchorage are over 7 miles up. Does he control the village ? If so, he is playing you false. If you still want to worry these people, that's the place to put in order. Couldn't you get the Commodore to send a light draught ship to maxe a survey of the mouth in case you are able to arrange for visiting it later ? It will always be an Alsatia, and you wont get a chance after the war of hav- -ing a decent report made. Yours sincerely' 77 - / 4 No.319 of 1916. British Residency and Oonsulate-Seneral, Bushire, 17th February 1916# To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandumo With reference to your letter N0.12-C of the 10th instant the following is the result of my enquiries;- In the first place the registration certificates for boats issued 'by the Director of Customs at Bushire during the Occupation, and since, are in no sense certi ficates of the 'bona fides of their nakhudas and owners. All boats in Bushire creek at the time were registeeed and these included seyeral vessels belonging to ports on the Tangistan and Dashti Coasts. In future the Director of Customs says that he will have a different letter for each port. It does not pay to bring tea from Bahrain to Bushire (i.e. # through the Customs)more particularly as there are large stocks in the place which cannot get out cf it and as a general rule it may be assumed by you that all Kakhu- das desiring to obtain permits to export tea from Bahrain to Bushire will not ultimately land the tea at Bushire but intend to smuggle it in elsewhere. This applies both to the case of Jfakhuda Zair Ismail Mo 199 w^o has never ar- / rived and about whom I am still making enquiries, but es pecially in the case of Uakhuda Ali Hassan of 'Lawar' Uo 155. This man is reilly Kakhuda Ali Hassan Zair Khalil of Grahi, a small port 4n the Tangistan Coast between Dilwar and Bulkhair; he does not belong to Lawar. The details given in your letter were read yesterday to one of the DashtiDashti Khans, who is in the Customs service here and is also \C / working for us, and a few hours later a man arrived from Lawar to tell him that Uakhuda Ali Hassan Zair Khalil who had had 'business with a certain trader in Bahrain in water-melons, or other vegetables last summer, had a dispute this time with the trader, who afterwards informed you of his intended shipment of tea; that the Nakhuda, after the impounding of his tea as re ported 'by you had sailed to Khur-i-Ziaret, where he now is, in tending to 'bribe Hussain Khan of Dashti to give him a certific ate to you that the tea was really destined for Lawar, The messenger added that the tea in question all 'belonged to i.e., was 'bought with the money of, Zair Khidhar Khan of Tangis tan, the rebel here, and his son Muhammad Ali, to Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah, the other rebel leader and to the sons of Nakhuda Zair Khidhar Haji Hussain of Goinak, a village in Tangistan,one of whom, Ghulam Reza, was actually in the boat of Nakhuda Ali Hassan at Bahrain. This information received last night was also confirmed by the Darya Begi 1 s head-nkin at Hallileh, from other sources. It may be added that since the transport of goods from Bushire to Shiraz has been stopped by us here, there is a great demand up- country, which it is very profitable for the rebels in Tangist=in to supply. At present tea is much cheaper in Tangistan than in Bushire. As regards Abdullah te bin Izhaq, I do not know how long he has been in Bahrain, but he does not belong to Bushire itself. Originally he hails from Dirazi in interior Dashti, lived at Jabri, a suburb of Bushire for some years, then got heavily into debt, and in 1912 or 1913 fled to Tangistan where Mr Chick saw him early in 1913o Since then he has been one of Zair Khidhar Khan's employes, particularly in the smuggling line. To sum up, Hakhuda Ali Hassan 1 s boat belongs to Tangistan not Bushire, and his cargo would undoubtedly never see Bushire: it is destined for the enemy, and one of the shippers in Bahrain is a partner with the enemy. In my opinion both Ali Hassan's boat if it appears, and the whole of its cargo or intended cargo should A be'bo confiscatad and held 'by you^and AMullah Izhaq fined expelled) and also Muhammad Sherif fined. No tea should here after be allowed a pass for Bushire ^aa such declarations are fraudulent: passes 4- for Lawar and Dayyir only given on the oer- tifioates of Kussain Khan and his 'brother, and the Customs Mu- dirs. Should other destinations on the Persian Coast he men tioned, a pass from a friendly Khan e»g. # Haidar Khan of Hayat Baud (Bunder Rig) or others should be demanded.

The tea for which your permit will be given, or has been given, is said to belong to people at Dilwar, Qoinal and Uadumari, all hostile Tangistani villages - and also to certain Bushin merchants including Haji shirazi (whose agent in Bahrain is Haji Hassan, I believe) If the 120 chests have not gone off yet, it would oe a good opportunity to drop on them all.

This nakhuda may also be sent to Bushire with the Basra Policemen for orders. His 2 khallasis' statements herewith - one of them claims himself to be nakhuda Ghulam bin Khalil.

[B y ' E te witnesss. '] German methods in Parsia have a peculiar interest since they offer a model, on a small scale, of her political machinery as a whole. Nowhere else have the threads of her intri gues been laid so bare ; nowhere are the ' motives, source, method and effect of her i propaganda so transparent. The specific is always more illuminating than the general ; and to follow the machinations of the Arm of ■ Wenckhaus before the war or the comings and gaings of the agents Wassmuss and Neidermayer during the last twelve months is to read the history of the Government in the individual. The secret of Germany's immediate strength is that every Hun unit fits in with her general scheme, whether by temperament or training, as ODmpactly as a cell in a natural organism. &gt; The quality of tact has been denied the Hun, but there is no doubt that he is able-; to practise the arts of conciliation on the 1 lower rungs of the ladder, however truculent o be may be when hn appear^ on the top. In I Persia one cannot but admire the adroitness with which he has combined the contralio- tory r6les of fugitive and protector. The persuasive tongue of Wassmuss resounds in the proclamations of the Khans of Tangistan in which these unregenerate highwaymen pro fess themselves shocked at the violation of Persian neutrality and demand the restitution of their innocent 'guests.' The 'guests' were the same Germans and Austrians who had brought their machine-gun over the Turkish border, flooded the country with inflimmatory leaflets, and against the express orders of the Persian Government, set up their wireless in stallation at Ispahan. Allied with these cham pions of Persian neutrality were the Turks, • who, until the Russians drove them out, had occupied Kermanshah, over-ran the pro vince of Azerbaijan, captured Tabriz, and put the inhabitants of the city to the sword. The Hun in Persia is champion of Demo cracy as well as of the integrity of small na tions. ' Germans and Democrats' • has been a common catchword in the South, and the Persians linked the words in all innocence, so that to the ignorant, ' Democrat' must have come to mean ' an employer of assassins who is prepared to pay a high wage.' ' Democracy' is a strange standard for the Hun to fly; but he is adaptable, and for the moment autocracy was not in the air. 'Islam' is the flag he is most constantly waving in the eyes of the credulous. He wears the fez in Baghdad and the Persian dress in Ispahan, squats in the Eastern tranner, fasts in Rama- zan and subscribes to the national faith, Sunoi or Shiah, according to the country of his adoption. In a Moslem country, his pro paganda is frankly anti-Christian; he has penetrated Iran from end to end accompanied by a fcroop of Mujahidin who have preached the holy war from Meshed to Kermanshah and proclaimed the advent of the '' Army of Deliverance.' For a long time Ispahan is the centre of intrigue. On the 4th February, 1915, Dr. Pugin arrives with a semi royal escort and hoists the German and Turkish flags. Before evening the German flag is torn tcr— shreds, bat it is seen flying again, in May the wireless is installed.

On the 4th February, 1915, Dr. Pugin arrives with a semi royal escort and hoists the German and Turkish flags. Before evening the German flag is torn to shreds, bat it is seen flying again. In May the wireless is installed. Protests, orders, expostulations pour in from Teheran, but the Governor- General iS dilatory in putting them into effect. And it would be a pity to remove this toy. For Che voice of the War Lord is heard daily in Ispahan sneaking with the elect. He tells of colossal disasters to the Slav, the destruction of the British Navy, the failure of the Bank of England, and the extinction of France. Farther south Wassmuss has ^ dummy wireless of his own, and he too confers with the All Highest in the camp of the simple Tangistanis, drawing sparks with a magnet in the night. Mysterious messages come through. The Protector of Islam has an eye that sees as far as Providence ; the Khans sib figuratively on his right hand ; their honoured names are on his lips ; and the forays of Shaikh H'isain and Zur Khidhar assume the proportions o' a crusade. The comic muse still holds the stage at Ispahan on the 20th May when large crovds lock to the cemetry of Takht-i-Rihad to see a German Zeppelin arrive la^ea with sugar— symbolic freight—from the North. The towns people search the sky with strained necks until dark when they return home disappoin ted much to the diminution of German pres tige. But things are to move mire quickly in the city, and the tragic muse will take her turn on the beards. When Seiler comes the tru culent Pugin is discredited, as not truculent enough. ' What have you done for us 1' he is asked, 'Nothing at all ! ' The man stands a self-confessed weakling, all wo-ds and bluff when he should be the father of riot and assassination. Clearly a more resource'ul head, a livelier propaganda is needed. On the 18th May, von Kaver, manager of the Russian Bank, is shot dead as he is driving home from the Russian Consulate where he has dined. An Arab in the employ of the German Consul is called in by the local authorities for examin ation in connection with the murder, bi^t tho man is suddenly spirited away by Seiler to Teheran. Soon afterwards, Mr. Grahame, the British Consul General, is shot at and wounded as he is riding through the streets and his Indian orderly is killed. In the meanwhile the flag of deliverance has reached Kerman. The townspeople flock to meet the Germans, Zugmeyer and Greis- inger, sacrifice a sheep and a cow in their honour; and in spite of the Governor-Gene ral who protests, the German and Turkish flags are hoisted on a house outside the city. Later the tireless Zugmeyer incites the people to crowd into the mosque and declare a Jehad and kill all the Russians and English. The British subject FaTukh Shah ia mur de-ed, and the murderer, as at Ispahan, takes refuge with the Germans. The Persians have a conveniently medieval system of 'bast,' or inviolxte sanctuary, which exactly fits in with the Hunnish renascence of the era of assassination. ' A small party of Englishmen,' writes Zugmeyer to a certain Chief, ' have comn to D——. It will be very easy to crush them. Proceed at once, kill thom and take possession of all their property, arms and ammunition, and send me one rifle o ; each kind possessed by them as a specimen.' There is something medieval in this direct appeal. It is murder become routine, not'war. Follow the agent X , a respectable mer chant who escaped from Basra when our troops attacked Fao.

Our own Moslem subjects would have scant respect for Eng lishmen who proved themselves such easy and interested converts, and profaned Islam with the mummeries o^ Wassmuss and Neidermeyer, appealing to ignorance and fanaticism and stir ring evil passions for selfish ends. The Hun's hypocr^iy is based on a desperate oppor tunism his Islamic bubble is nearly burst; and every month that the war is protracted Germany's mask is the more transparent. If she wishes to establish an Empire in Asia she will b.ve to mend her ways. For the Govermcent that intrigues with a religion, cynically playing off sect against sect, will endure a single generation in the East It ie the achievement of a handful of Germans in Persia to have introduced war brigandage, loot and murder into one of the few countries in the world which might have enjoyed peace. Happily they have dis-* covered that lies and assassinations, though useful in disturbing the equilibrium of a neutral country, cannot be made the per manent basis of authority. With the entry of General Sykes into Kerman one of the last centres of propaganda has been swept clean. The crisis was passed in November last year, when the ooup d'etat, by which Persia was to be dragged into the war, even as Tuijkey twelve months before, was foiled. Russia marched her troops from Kasvin to within a day's march of the capital, bringing to bear the only argument the hostile confederates could understand. On the 15th November the young Shah threw the Germans overboard and Persia was saved. Northern and Western Persia were cleared as the Russians swept south defeat ing the rebels at Kum (December 15th) and Hamadan (December 21st^ and driving the Turks over their own frontier at Kirmanshab. April saw the beginning of collapse in the Eastern provinces. The Governor of Kirman in consequence of cer tain outrages expelled the Germans from the town, disarmed the gendarmerie and sent them under escort to Shiraz. The Germans and Austrians who were expelled from Kirman were attacked by a tribal force at Arzenjan ; captured and dispatched to Teheran. The Germans suffered defeat about the same time in another encounter at Sirjan, when four Austrians and one German were killed, and 20 Austrians captured. Zugmeyer's party was attacked by tho Bakhtiaris near BiftandDr. Bisch was captured, sent to Bandar Abbas, and is now interned in India. Next Shiraz was purged. All the gendarmerie- were put under arrest. The editors of the inflammatory leaflets the ' Hayat,' ' Tazianah,' and ' Intiqam ' were seized. In May Seyyid Isa, the notorious firebrand of Ram Hormuz surrendered to the Bakhtiarij, and Mr. Grahame and the British colony were reinstalled in Ispahan.Telegram. R.
