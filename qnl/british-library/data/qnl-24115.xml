As M.E.A.L.U. cannot undertake locust control Oman this season, Government of India is accepting responsibility and their Mission should arrive Shaffjah second half January. 3. Organisation will be similar to last year but with Indian not British leader. 4. All M.E.A.L.U. transport, bait and equipment left at Sharjah will be at disposal of Indian Mission. 6. Can you please check following points: (a) Have all remaining 10 trucks been overhauled and made serviceable by R.A.F. as arranged by Joyce? (b) Is all equipment in store c/o Mohamed Sherif safe? (c) Do workshop facilities still exist at Sharjah for repairs to vehicles as last year? (d) Will Sharjah be able to supply against repayment average 4 B.O. and 40 Levi rations? 6. I am contacting G.H.Q., M.E.F. for any necessary approval regarding above. 7. After Indian Mission takes over, all further arrangements should be made by India not M.E.A.L.U. 8. Fitzgerald will probably visit Shrajah to meet Indian Mission. 9. Have any locusts been seen your area? I saw a few scattered red corpses at Dubai.
