I t may be desirable to place upon record^ in a more connected form than is presented by the despatches which, have been addressed to the Secretary of State upon the subject, some of which, moreover, were necessarily written under considerable pressure, a summary of the transactions of the last two years, which have terminated in the deposition of Mulhar Hao, Gaekwar, from the Sovereignty of the Baroda State. 2. Mulhar Rao, Gaekwar, succeeded his brother, Khundee Rao, in 1870. Much correspondence took place in 1872 and 1873 between the Govern ment of Bombay and the Government of India with reference both to the general misgovernment of the Baroda State and to particular cases. Ultimately, in the summer of 1873, the Government of Bombay represent ed their opinion that measures of decided interference were necessary. Accordingly, at their recommendation, with which the Government of India concurred, a Commission was appointed for the purpose of investigating and reporting upon the general condition of the State. Sir Richard Meade, whose character for calmness of judgment is well known, who has an extensive knowledge of Native States, and who throughout bis career has shown that he is ready to make every allowance in their favour, and that he has no wish to enforce a standard which it would be unreasonable to expect in their administration, was appointed to be President of the Commis sion. Nawab Eaiz Ali Khan, who had been Prime Minister of the State of Jeypore, and in whose character and ability great confidence was placed by the Maharaja of Jeypore, as well as by the British Government, was appointed to be a Member of the Commission. The other two Members—Mr. Ravenscroft and Colonel Etheridge—were nominated by the Bombay Government, and are officers of high standing and character. 3. The report of the Commission, which was received by the Government of India on 25th Eebruary 1874, showed a condition of things which was highly discreditable to Mulhar Rao, and which contained the elements of serious disturbance, which, owing to the manner in which the territories of the British Government and the Gaekwar are intermingled, might have been greatly prejudicial to the interests of British subjects and to the peace and order of Her Majesty's dominions. The Commissioners expressed their opinion that in the summary and extensive reduction of Silladars and Sirdars, in the treatment of certain bankers, in the seizure of women to render forced service in the Palace, in the treatment of the late Gaekwar's relatives, favorites, and dependants, and in the arbitrary resumption of certain inams and hereditary emoluments, the proceedings of Mulhar Rao had been ' highly arbitrary, and in some ins- ' tances very unjust, and of a character calculated to bring grave discredit on ' His Highness' administration, and to excite distrust and alarm amongst a large 'portion of the influential and respectable classes of the community.' The Commissioners further reported that the grievances of the agricultural classes( 2 ) required careful examination and consideration; tliat the existing pra^-lce of levying nuzzerana (a succession tax) on appointments was wholly inconsistent with good government and should be entirely relinquished and interdicted; that the practice of ill-treating accused persons or prisoners to extract confession ohtained to some extent and demanded the most watchful efforts for its absolute suppression; that the judicial department and administration required entire reform, in order to remove the existing uncertain and irregular application of the law and want of confidence in the proceedings of the courts and Magistrates ; and that the state of affairs, when viewed altogether, constituted general mal administration of a character urgently calling for reformation, which could not be effected without some interference on the part of the British Government. 4. There is no doubt as to the right which the British Government possesses both under treaty and by constant usage to interpose in the internal affairs of the Baroda State. The provisions of the treaty of 1802 are clear, and the letter from Mr. Mountstuart Elphinstone, then Governor of Bombay, to the ruling Gaekwar in 1820, in which the results of various conferences with the Gaekwar regarding Baroda affairs were recorded, and which contains an exposition of his relations to the British Government, lays down in the plainest possible terms the rights of the British Government. 5. Accordingly in a letter from the Viceroy dated 25th July 1874, authoritative advice was given to Mulhar Eao for the remedy of the principal evils disclosed by the report of the Commission. A period of eighteen months, ending on 31st December 1875, was allowed to him for effecting the necessary reforms, and every assistance was offered him for that purpose. The Government of India, after some time had elapsed, became dissatisfied with the manner in which Colonel Phayre, the British President at Baroda, carried out the instructions which were given to him, and arrangements were therefore made, in the beginning of November last, to replace him by Sir Lewis Pelly, an Officer of the highest rank in the Political Service, in whom the Government placed the fullest confidence. 6. While these arrangements were in progress, information was received that an attempt had been made to poison Colonel Phayre. 7. Sir Lewis Pelly arrived at Baroda on 4th December 1874, and found affairs there in a very critical condition. Although assurances had been given from time to time by Mulhar Bao that he would carry out the reforms which he had been required by the Government of India to undertake, no substantial progress had been made. The condition of the cultivating classes was represented as desperate, owing to the over-assess ment of the land revenue, while the differences between the Sirdars and the Gaekwar threatened a serious disturbance of the peace. Mulhar llao gave assurances to Sir Lewis Pelly that remedies would be applied to this condition of affairs. Sir Lewis Pelly expressed his belief that those assurances were sincere, and the Government of India entertained some hope that although no confidence could be placed in the personal character of Mulhar Bao, yet he might be induced to allow the administration of the State to be effectually reformed. b( 3 ) the meantime Colonel Phayre had instituted an enquiry and ex amined the servants at the Residency immediately after the attempt to poison him. No evidence of any value was procured, and the enquiry was for the time closed; but Sir Lewis Pelly was instructed to take measures to investigate the case, and for that purpose he obtained the assistance of Mr. Souterandthe Police Officers of Bombay. Eor some time they could obtain no evidence of importance; but in the middle of December they discovered that Mulhar Hao had been in the habit of holding secret communications by night with the Residency servants. They also discovered that one of those servants, Haoji, had been spending large sums of money: they arrested him on suspicion, and he confessed that he had committed the offence, and alleged that he had done so at the personal instigation of Mulhar Rao. At the same time another Residency servant, JSFarsu, who had been arrested in consequence of the statements of Raoji, made a similar confession. Raoji made this confession on receiving the promise of a pardon; but Narsu was distinctly told by Sir Lewis Pelly that he must not expect a pardon. Sir Lewis Pelly was instructed to communicate the evidence to the Advocate-General of Bombay, who advised that, if it stood the test of cross-examination, it would be sufficient to convict Mulhar Rao of the offence in a Court of Law. Mr. Souter was immediately despatched to Calcutta with the evidence and the opinion of the Advocate-General of Bombay. When these documents were received in Calcutta, they were referred for the opinion of the Acting Advocate-General and the Standing Counsel to Government at Calcutta, who advised that the evidence was sufficient to commit Mulhar Rao for trial, but stated some doubts with regard to portions of the evidence, and alluded to the possibility of there being a conspiracy against Mulhar Rao. 9. The case was then considered with the greatest attention by the Government of India. Mr. Souter was most carefully questioned with respect to the nature of the police investigation, and he explained that every precaution had been taken to prevent evidence being concocted by the subordinate police officials. The probability of there being a conspiracy against Mulhar Rao was discussed, but no reasonable ground could be found for such a supposition. The Government of India considered, therefore, that there was strong 'prima facie reason to believe that the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre had been instigated by Mulhar Rao. 10. The question then arose, how this condition of things was to be dealt with. It was impossible to pass over an attempt on the life of a British Re sident at the Court of a Native Prince. The sanctity attached to the lives of Ambassadors extended, in the opinion of the Government of India, if possible in a greater degree to British Residents at the Courts of Native States; no crime, therefore, could be more serious than an attempt upon the life of a British Resident instigated by the Ruler of a Native State. The evidence as it then stood would not have justified the Government of India in at once condemning Mulhar Rao, because he had had no opportunity of making his defence, and the witnesses had not been subjected to cross-examination. Some enquiry, therefore, was essential. b( 4 ) 11. In deciding upon the course to be adopted, the Govern men t^f India could not overlook the character and antecedents of Mulhar Eao. He had been accused of having been engaged in a conspiracy to murder his brother Khundee Rao, Gaekwar in 1863, and had in consequence been kept in seclusion during the life time of his brother. After Mulhar Hao's accession to the Sovereignty of Baroda, Bhow Sindia the Minister of the late Gaekwar had died in prison under suspicious circumstances, and was generally supposed to have been poisoned. Ihe Government of India had expressed to Mulhar Rao their regret that, in consequence of his having omitted to follow the advice given by the Assistant Resident, the only satisfactory means of clearing up the doubts which rested on the death of Bhow Sindia had been neglected. Moreover, the whole tenor of the report of Sir Richard Meade's Commission was highly unfavorable to Mulhar Rao's personal character. 12. Having regard to these circumstances and to the strong prima facie case against Mulhar Rao, it appeared that there was no probability of a fair enquiry being made into the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre so long as Mulhar Rao remained in the position of Ruler of Baroda, and that it would have been improper for the Government of India to continue friendly communications with him pending the investigation. It was, therefore, deter mined to suspend Mulhar Rao from power, and to assume, on behalf of the Queen, the administration of the State of Baroda pending the result of the enquiry. This action was not based on considerations of law. It was an act of State, carried out by the Paramount Power. Troops were sent to Baroda. Mulhar Rao was arrested; and the administration of the State was assumed with promptness and without disturbance by Sir Lewis Pelly. 13. The Government of India had next to determine what form the en quiry should take. Notwithstanding the objections to which a public enquiry was open, it was decided that a public enquiry was more advisable than one con ducted in private, which might have given occasion for suspicion. The composi tion of the Commission was next considered. In order that it should be so con stituted as to command complete confidence, the services of Sir Richard Couch, the Chief Justice of Bengal, and the highest judicial authority in India, were se cured as President. Sir Richard Meade, whose character has been already describ ed, and Mr. Philip Melvill, an Officer who had been Judicial Commissioner of the Central Provinces, and acted as a Judge of the Chief Court at Lahore, who had no connection whatever with Baroda affairs, and whose character for independence and ability is well known, were appointed to be Commissioners. The Government of India considered that it was desirable to obtain the assist ance of Natives of India of high rank and position as Members of the Com mission. Raja Sir Dinkur Rao was summoned to Calcutta, and consented to serve. I requested Maharaja Scindia, Maharaja Holkar, and the Maharaja of Jeypore to join the Commission. Maharaja Holkar, while expressing his complete concurrence in the course which had been taken, excused himself from serving, but the other two Princes consented to serve. b( 5 ) In making public tlie suspension of the Gaekwar and the institution of the enquiry, it was announced that whatever the result might be, a Native Administration would be re-established at Baroda. Throughout the whole of these transactions the Government of India were of opinion that it was essential to show that the British Government were actuated by no interested motives. 15. The Commission was not constituted as, or intended to be, a I- —That the said Mulhar Rao, Gaekwar, did by his agents and in person hold judicial tribunal, secret communications for improper purposes with some of the servants employed Tfc + by Colonel Phayre, the Resident at Baroda, or attached to the Residency. lUnCtlOn was tO II-—That the said Mulhar Rao, Gaekwar, gave bribes to some of those servants, rCDOrt to the GoV- or caused such bribes to be given. I HI- —That his purposes in holding such communications and giving such bribes eminent of India, were to use the said servants as spies upon Colonel Phayre, and thereby improperly to obtain information of secrets and to cause injury to Colonel Phayre, or to re- with whom the move him by means of poison. , . . . IV. —That, in fact, an attempt to poison Colonel Phayre was made by persons decision Was Ultl- instigated thereto by the said Mulhar Rao, Gaekwar. mitely to rest The imputations against Mulhar Bao, into the truth of which the Commis sion was instructed to enquire, are noted in the margin. 16. It was indispensable, in order to investigate the graver imputation of instigating the attempt to poison, that the Commission should enquire into the allegation that Mulhar Bao had been in the habit of holding secret communications by night with the Besidency servants, and of giving them money for the purpose of obtaining information as to the business con ducted at the Besidency, The Government of India had good reason to believe that attempts of the kind had habitually been made by Mulhar Bao; and it was necessary, for the purpose of clearing the way to the examination of his connection with the poisoning, that the truth of his secret com munications with the Besidency servants, who were supposed to be the agents in the crime, should be investigated. If the evidence with respect to those communications had broken down, it would have been a strong argument in favor of the innocence of Mulhar Bao. If, on the other hand, the secret in terviews were established, the antecedent improbability that he should have been in secret personal commumcation by night with persons of that class would be removed. 17. The Commission commenced their proceedings on 23rd Pebruary and closed them on 31st March 1875. Sir B. Couch (the President), Sir B. Meade, and Mr. Melvill were of opinion that all the imputations against Mulhar Bao were true. Maharaja Scindia and Baja Sir Dinkur B^ao found the graver imputation not proved, while the Maharaja of Jeypore thought that Mulhar Bao was not implicated in the charges: and all three treated the minor imputations as matters of no importance, and in accordance with the practice at other Native Courts. 18. The Government of India did not consider that the circumstance that the Commissioners were equally divided in opinion justified them in treating Mulhar Bao as innocent of the charges imputed to him. He was the Sovereign of a large territory and responsible for its government. The Government of India have intimate relations with the Baroda State, for the proper conduct of which it is essential that they should be able to communicate with the b( 6 ) Gaekwar in terms of confidence and friendsliip. Tliis would ha-T^been impossible, considering Mulhar Rao's character and antecedents, so long as lie lay even nnder the suspicion of being concerned in a cowardly and atrocious crime, not against an ordinary individual, but against the Representative of the British Government at his Court. 19. It has already been stated that the Commission differed essentially from a judicial tribunal, and this is apparent upon the face of the public instructions which the Commissioners received. It was their function to receive and examine the evidence and to report their opinions upon it, as well as to afford Mulhar Rao an opportunity of freeing himself from the grave suspicion which attached to him. But the Government of India were the ultimate judges of the matter enquired into; they held it to be their duty to express a final decision upon the issues which were laid before the Commissioners; and they would not have supported the opinions of a majority, or even of the whole body, unless they had considered that those opinions were based upon sufficient evidence. 20. The possibility that the Commissioners might be divided in opinion, or that they might not be able to arrive at any very positive conclusions, had been previously discussed, and it was the deliberate opinion of the Govern ment of India that, bearing in mind the character and antecedents of Mulhar Rao, he should not be restored to power unless he should be able to clear himself fully from the suspicion which attached to him. 21. The Government of India most carefully and deliberately considered the reports of the Commissioners and the evidence on which they were based, and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that the imputations against Mulhar Rao were true. It was therefore determined to recommend to Her Majesty's Government that Mulhar Rao and his issue should be deposed; that the fittest member of the Gaekwar House should be selected in his room; and that Jumnabaee, the widow of the late Gaekwar Khundee Rao whose loyalty to the British Government was shown during the events of 1857, should be permitted, in accordance with a request which she had made, to adopt the person who should be so selected. In appointing a successor to Mulhar Rao, the Government of India considered that no change should be made in the relations which existed by treaty between the British Government and the Gaekwars of Baroda. 22. These opinions of the Government of India were transmitted by telegraph for the consideration of Her Majesty's Government. 23. Her Majesty's Government decided that Mulhar Rao, together with his issue, should be deposed from the Sovereignty of Baroda, and sanctioned all the proposals with respect to the re-establishment of a Is ati'v e Adminis tration in that State which were made by the Government of India. Her Majesty's Government, however, directed that the deposition of Mulhar Rao should not be based upon the enquiry and report of the Commission, but upon general grounds. The Government of India reviewed the conduct of Mulhar Rao since the report of Sir Richard Meade's Commission, and were so b( 7 ) satisfip^of tlie justice and propriety of not replacing Mulhar Rao in power, apart from the result of the recent inquiry, that they did not hesitate to act upon the instructions which they had receiyed. Accordingly, in the Pro clamation which announced the deposition of Mulhar Hao, it was stated that Her Majesty's Government had not based their decision on the enquiry or report of the Commission, and that they had not assumed that the result of the enquiry had been to prove the truth of the imputations against Mulhar Hao. 24. It may be alleged, in opposition to the course that has been adopted, that, if Mulhar Rao has been justly deposed upon general grounds, he should have been deposed either upon the receipt of the report of Sir Meade's Commission, or at some other time before the inquiry before Sir Richard Couch's Commission was concluded. But a review of the circumstances in the order in which they occurred will show that the Government of India could not, consistently with the forbearance which they considered it to be both right and expedient to exercise in dealing with Mulhar Rao, have recom mended his deposition at any former time. 25. Sir Richard Meade's Commission did not recommend Mulhar Rao's deposition, neither did the Government of Bombay, through whom their report was brought under the consideration of the Government of India. The evidence was not considered by the Government of India to be suffi cient in itself to justify the adoption of so extreme a measure. At the same time the charges of misgovernment proved against Mulhar Rao were very grave; his personal character was seriously compromised; and he was distinctly warned that he would be deposed if he did not take advantage of the period of grace then given to him. Her Majesty's Government approved of the manner in which Mulhar Rao was then dealt with. I am satisfied that the action which was taken was just and sufficient, and that it was so con sidered at the time by all those who were in a position to give a sound opinion upon the subject. 26. In the interval between the report of Sir Richard Meade's Com mission and Mulhar Rao's suspension from power, several instances undoubtedly occurred in which he gravely misconducted himself. These were his marriage with Luxmabaee; his treatment of Ruckmabaee the younger widow of his brother; and his quarrels with his Sirdars. In consequence, however, of Colonel Phayre's proceedings, which eventually led to his removal from Baroda, the Government of India felt themselves compelled to accept his reports of Mulhar Rao's misconduct with some qualification, and up to the time of the serious attempt to take the life of Colonel Phayre the Government of India did not think that sufficient reasons existed to make it desirable for them to re-consider their decision granting to Mulhar Rao a period of grace. On looking back to the circumstances as they were then known, apart from subsequent events, I am satisfied that the deposition of Mulhar Rao during this period would have been regarded as showing a pre-determination on the part of the Government of India to remove Mulhar Rao, and a refusal to( 8 ) allow him the opportunity which had been promised him for it^^ming the administration of Baroda. 27. A second warning was given to Mnlhar Rao when Sir Lewis Pelly was appointed to succeed Colonel Phayre. Sir Lewis Pelly, on his arrival at Baroda, described the state of affairs to be very critical, as has been mentioned in paragraph 7 of this Minute. At the same time he did not suggest that Mulhar Bao should be then deposed. He reported that Mulhar Bao professed his readiness to accept his advice—had indeed accepted it upon some matters, and so far as he could judge sincerely desired to reform the administration. Although after what had previously occurred the Government of India could attach but little value to such professions, there were certainly at that time no sufficient reasons for deviating from the course which had before been adopted and announced to Mulhar Bao, namely, that he should still have the benefit of the period of grace originally given to him, together with every assistance which could be afforded to him by Sir Lewis Pelly. 28. The suspension of Mulhar Bao, in consequence of the evidence which was obtained of his complicity in the attempt to murder Colonel Phayre, occur red soon after Sir Lewis Pelly's arrival at Baroda. In the 8th and following paragraphs of this Minute I have shown that the evidence by itself would not have justified the deposition of Mulhar Bao without further inquiry. 29. The administration of the State of Baroda was necessarily then placed for the time in Sir Lewis Pelly's hands; and much further information was obtained which added very materially to the previous evidence of the mis- government of the Baroda State, of Mulhar Bao's misconduct, and of his incapacity to carry into effect the necessary reforms. 30. Mr. Dadabhoy Nowrojee, the Minister in whom Mulhar Bao pro fessed to place confidence, and who, so far as the Government of India could judge, had been sincerely desirous of reforming the administration, resigned office; no explanation was afforded of the reasons for his resignation. Sir Lewis Pelly found that the finances of the State had been grossly mis managed. The revenue during the past year was found to be 94 lakhs of rupees (£940,000), and the expenditure during the same time no less than 171 lakhs (£1,710,000), out of which sum 40 lakhs (£400,000) had been expended in gifts chiefly made to favorites and courtesans, and 30 lakhs (£300,000) more had been spent in building and repairing palaces and other personal expenses of Mulhar Bao. The manner in which the accounts were kept was most unsatis factory. In the Baroda State Treasury a sum of less than two thousand rupees (£200) was found when Sir Lewis Pelly assumed the administration, while 40 lakhs (£400,000) were afterwards discovered by Sir Lewis Pelly concealed in the Palace, and further considerable sums had undoubtedly been removed. 31. The enquiries that were made respecting the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre naturally led to an enquiry into the circumstances of the death of Bhow Sindia in 1872, which, as I have mentioned before, was generally( 9 ) attributed to poison, and as to wliicli some suspicion attaclied to Mulliar Rao. Depositions were taken before officers who had been charged by Sir Lewis Polly with the duty. Those depositions tended to confirm the suspicion that Ehow Sindia was poisoned. Again it appeared in the course of the enquiries which had been carried on at Baroda connected with the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre that a man of the name of Govind Naik had met with his death in a manner to induce Sir Lewis Pelly to believe that Mulhar Eao either gave himself, or caused to be given, orders by virtue of which a system of torture was put in force under which Govind Naik finally succumbed. In this case also formal depositions were taken which led to the conclusion stated by Sir Lewis Pelly. 32. It is obvious that these and other circumstances disclosed after Mulhar Rao's suspension, although they afforded substantial ground for a re consideration of the decision at which the Government of India had arrived to allow him his full period of grace, could not with propriety have been dealt with pending the result of the inquiry before Sir Richard Couch's Commission. 33. It appears then that at no time between the report of Sir Richard Meade's Commission and the conclusion of the inquiry carried on before Sir Richard Couch's Commission were the Government of India in a position to recommend the deposition of Mulhar Rao. At the same time, independently of the inquiry into the attempt to poison Colonel Phayre, evidence to the effect that Mulhar Rao could not, with a due regard to the interests of the people of Baroda, be restored to power, had accumulated since the warning given to him after the report of Sir Richard Meade's Commission; and especially much additional proof of his misconduct and unfitness had been received since his suspension from power. As regards Mulhar Rao's issue, the circumstances of his marriage with Luxmabaee, and her having given birth to a son five months' after that marriage, led to the conclusion that it would have been highly detri mental to the interests of the State of Baroda that any recognition should be given to the possible claims of that infant (the only male issue of Mulhar Rao on behalf of whom any claim to legitimacy could be advanced) to the Sovereignty of Baroda. 34. All these circumstances have probably been considered by Her Majes ty's Government. They are mentioned here for the purpose of indicating the manner in which the question presented itself to the Government of India, and the reasons which led them to accept without hesitation the decision of Her Majesty's Government that the deposition of Mulhar Rao and of his issue should be based upon general grounds. It has already been shown that the recommendation of the Government of India that Mulhar Rao should be deposed was based upon the fact of his remaining subject, under the most favorable view that could be taken of the circumstances, to a grave suspicion of having instigated the attempt to murder Colonel Phayre, coupled with his previous character and antecedents. 35. Throughout all these painful transactions the Government of India have endeavoured to deal with Mulhar Rao in a spirit of perfect' impartiality( 10 ) Looking not only to the poisoning case, but to liis cliaracter and antecedents, to tlie mal-administration of the State of Baroda, and to the measures~4&amp;ken in consequence, I can confidently assert that Mulhar Rao has been treated by the Government of India with the utmost forbearance that was compatible with the duty of the British Government to insist that the person of a British Resident at a Native Court should be respected, and that a State enjoying British protection, the peace of which is maintained by Her Majesty's forces, should be so administered as to secure the people from grievous abuses. That it was both just and expedient to have exercised such forbearance cannot, I conceive, be disputed. NOKTHBEOOK.
