Other correspondents include officials from the Residencies and Agencies in both the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia, as well as the Ambassador at Constantinople.The documents cover several topics, including:The threat to Bahrain from the Beni Hajir tribe and Ottoman ambitions to extend their sovereignty to the island, including the Turkish plan to build a coal depot on the island as a pretext to further political involvement;Questions of how to police the waters under Turkish authority;How Britain should deal with Shaikh Jasim [Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thāni] of El Bidaa [Doha];Turkish claims to parts of the coast of Guttur [Qatar].The document concludes with the perceived outcomes of the discussions, including closer ties with the ruler of Bahrain, who, in December 1880, agreed not to open relations with any foreign power other than Britain.The author quotes extensively from the correspondence and other sources, notes on which are to be found in the margin throughout.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Qatar Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Hājir (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>El Bidaa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Piracy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003dd#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
