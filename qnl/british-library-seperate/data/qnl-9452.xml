The reason for the request was that the value of good interpreters had been forced up by the prices that oil companies and other concerns were prepared to pay for them (folio 5), with consequent loss of good staff.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Translators</topic></subject><subject><topic>Wages</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000211#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
