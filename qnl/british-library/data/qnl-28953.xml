The Under for Secretary of State Foreign Affairs, India Office, Whitehall. DEC 1943 Dear Sir, -v I have recently 'been granted a permit to enable me to take my small daughter out to Join my husband in Persia# When I applied to the Shipping Companies for a passage I was told that all passages were in the hands of the Government, as the number of women wishing to proceed to the Persian Gulf must be limited, I wondered if you could possibly help me to obtain a passage as I am very anxious that ray daughter will have some opportunity of getting to know her father before she has to come home to school. Uty husband, Mr# H.E# Sinclair, has now been recalled to his former work in the Imperial Bank of Iran, but when he was first sent out in October 19V1 he was a Vice Consul at Bushire# I have been 2 years trying to get a Permit and so am naturally very keen to get out to ny husband as soon as possible - so please if it is possible for you to help me in this matter X would be more than grateful. I am a trained childrens Nurse and/and would be quite willing to assist anyone travelling with children, if in so doing I could get out sooner. Tours faithfully, &lt; (Sgd.)
