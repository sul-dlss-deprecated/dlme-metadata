ImDortant^ n Your telegram of the 10th November, K g. T/99• Bahrain Oil. Gommunication suggested in your paragraph 1 was made orally to-day to Ballantyne who was informed tliat we should however he prepared to recommend to Shaikh to grant, subject to any legal formalities, an extension ( to form part of any extension which might subsequently he granted of prospecting licenee ) not heyond the end of the present calender year^for purposes of negotiati- -ations only should this 'be necessary and Company apply for it. 2. Ballantyne was also informed that Shaikh regarded Company'.s offer as financially unsatisfactory 'but that we could not give him details, which would he communicated direct to Skinner and that His ^Kcellency had also raised question of commercially exploitable quantities. Points of interest to him in this connec- -tion were presumably (a) definition of phrase occur- -ring six times in mining lease (b) modification in lease to secure that payment at rate of Es. 50,000/- fell due within lesser minimum period than five years ( e.g. two years } .■ * . . ■-2- 3. Ballantyne said that San Prancisco would have to consulted on all points. He thought it likely they would apply to take out Mining Lease on December 2nd (this may of course he hluff). Speaking personally, he thought request for advancement of date from which Bs.30,000/- would he payable was not unreasonable and that Company would probably at proper time,i.e. in connec tion with amendments to Mining Lease, be preparec to consider it. He doubted if they would regard it as a fair demand as part consideration for extension of Prospecting License. 4. He was informed that it was for Company to decide whether or not to take out Mining Lease on December 2nd and that you would be requested immediately to arrange for communication to Skinner of Shaikh's reaction to Company^ proposals {? in the sense) of paragraph 5 of your telegram of 10th November. Please take necessary i action. Company in this connection have in the past been reluctant to agree to lump sum payment and Shaikh might as alternative ask for increase of loan to State by, say, Es.25,000A or even Es.50,000/- and might perhaps stipulate that amount not to be recovered should be increased to, say, half of total amount ^including gift of Rs &lt; 25,000/- to Shaikh) to be advanced by Company. 5. Amendments in Mining Lease set out in enclosure to draft letter to Ballantyne sent by air mail of November 10th were communicated to Company on 11th with omission of proposed alteration in Article X and with verbal modifi cations in last paragraph of Imut.) letter. — Ballantyne/Ballantyne intimated that tliespQ would 'be at once commuaioated for consideration to San Francisco. 6. We should like to raise with Company question of what arrangements they propose with regard to refining. Do you see any objection to this or would you think it better for Loch to raise it on Shaikh's 'behalf with Skinner? 7, Your demi-official of October 31st, 1782-3 paragraph 2 construction (a) is correct. . , . - C-'-H r ^ 0 - Secretary of State for IndiaTelegram XX From To H.M. f s Secretary of State for India London.

In favour of acceptance of Company's revised offer axe facts that la) Shaikh under it will secure what we understand is of importance to him - lump sum down; (b) he will secure non-repayable Ils .60,000A (being difference over a three-year period between Bs.10,000/- and Ks.30,000/-) if declaration of commer cial production is delayed for full period of five years in addition to Hs.100,000/- already offered; (c) extension will give more time and may produce better/-2- 'better atmosphere for 'bargaining for remaining Mining Lease amendments, including in particular important amendment regarding royalty in Article III, 5, Arguments against acceptance are (a) if extension is now given Petroleum Department are of opinion on such evidence as is available that Company on information to he secured during period of extension are likely to he ahle to reach definite decision as to area and, so far as can he judged, to include within 100,000 acres all oil areas of substantial value at present time; this would of course mean (h) that neither Bahrain Petroleum Company nor any other Oil Company would, at any rate, for some considerable time he likely to interest themselves in balance of islands, and that Shaikh^ receipts would therefore be confined to amounts now offered by Bahrain Petroleum Company and those to which he is entitled under Mining Lease; (c) if extension is refused, while latest indications are that we cannot be sure that Anglo Persian Oil gompany would make early move in respect of balance of islands, successful operations by Bahrain Petroleum Gompany under Mining Lease would afford best guarantee of subsequent application in respect of remainder of islands either from Anglo Persian Oil Company or from Bahrain Petroleum Company,although this might not of course happen for some years• \ 4, Petroleum Department state that precise del inition of 'commercially explibitable guantities' (paragraph 4 of your telegram of 10th November, T/99) presents difficulty• Usual criteria are (a) a specified test/-3- test of wells on accepted 'basis to yield a minimum output (13) a dead rental of such amount as to make it desirable from Company's own standpoint to declare commercial production.

Petroleum Department state,that had we &gt; completely free hand, and were Shaikh in no hurry to secure immediate financial advantage, they would definitely recommend that he should refuse further extension of Prospecting License and require Oompany to take out instrument of Mining Lease, un the other hand, Shaikh is under^stood to want money; offer now put forward hy Company seems definitely to represent x their last word; and attitude which they have adopted suggests thst they feel fairly confident that they can at once select essential areas. 6. Decision is essentially one for Shaikh in the light of our advice. Case for grant of exten sion is, in our view, on the merits, in view of advance made 'by Company in regard to minimum royalty and fact that there appears to he no prospect of their raising their hid, a good one.

P,Z.6821/33. 1th November 1933. dear Starling, We sent you on 6th November, under the above number, copies of the Political Resident's despatch No. 1275-3 of 3rd October 1933, covering inter alia a VO „ letter aated 6th September 1933 from Holmes to Ballantyne, being his defence in respect of the various incidents to which exception was taken in the Colonial Office letter of 28th July last, No.18135/33. 2. To take first a minor point. Holmes's letter and its enclosures certainly seem to make it clear that there was what we should, 1 think, now regard as an undesirable degree of direct dealing between the Financial Adviser, Bahrein and Holmes in the early part of this year. As you will remember, however, the Resident was instructed, (in the Secretary of State's telegram of 31st July, No.1898, copy sent to you and the other interested Departments under our printed letter No. p.Z.4656/33 of 1st August) G. Starling, Esq ., that/ Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, S.W. 1.(9 - 2 - u V* that it was, in our view, aesirable to interpret Condition 'C scheciulea to the Indenture of 12th June 1930 as strictly as possible, and that we should 'be glad 11 both the aheikh and Belgrave could be 'tactfully dissuaded from having any discussion, oral or other, with Holmes on oil questions, which we are anxious should be dealt with solely through the Political Agent.' The Acting Political Kesiaent, in his telegram of 4th August, No.638, replied that the Sheikh entirely agreed to a strict interpretation of Condition 'C and continued that it would in his (Colonel Jboch's) view be advisable for the A.P.O.C. also 'to conduct negotiations, written and oral, entirely through the Political Agent, as it vail be contrary to their interests and ours if the Bahrein Petroleum Company were placed in a position to complain that we were favouring the A.P.O.C. by allowing their emissaries direct access to the Sheikh when the Chief Local Representative was debarred from it.' Consequent on this suggestion the A.P.O.C. undertook to deal with oil questions solely through the Political Agent. I do not think, in these circumstances, that there is any need to say anything further to the Resident as to the importance of/of securing that ail coimnunications, whether oral or written, are made througn the Political Agent, out a copy of this letter will, of course, go to Bushire and to the Government of India. 3. I now turn to the question of territorial waters. You will rememher that we have had a good deal c - __ of correspondence on the question whether or not the territorial waters of Bahrein are included under the Concession of 2na December 1925 (see in particular paragraphs 4 and 5 of my letter to you of 2nd August, No. P.Z.4660/33; my letter to you of 9th August, P.Z.4857/33; paragraph 11 of the minutes of the meeting held at the India Office on 10th August; paragraph 2(d) of our telegram to the Resident No.2000 of 11th August; and paragraph 2 of the Resident's reply of 15th August, No.683). paragraph 3 of Holmes's letter of 6th September 1933 seems, however, to me to establish fairly definitely that the existing Concession is not regarded by the Company as extending to territorial waters, and you will notice that the Sheikh appears to have made it quite clear to Holmes that he was under the impression that the Concession embraced dry land only. Do you agree as to this interpretation? If so, the ground will he/m. /Q. „ ) be clear in case the question oecomes a live one at a later stage. 4. I alii sending copies of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office and to Moore at the iidmiralty, and copies will go hy this week's air mail to the Political Resident and to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, J.G. LAITHWAITE.Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, for the information of the Political Resident, Bushire.

W. 1 inmea « P.Z.7189/33. 8th November 1933 Iv'Iy dear starling, You will remember that consequent on the meeting held here on 27th September, general agreement was reached as to the amendments to be suggested to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their mining lease. We had, as you know, been very anxious to make a communication -to the GOiupany on this subject, but thought it better on the whole; uo postpone doing so until the position as regards uiie possible acQuisition of land at Bahrein for naval purposes anu one requirements of trie Air Ministry was clearer, so that we could if necessary inform Ballantyne without delay, in the event of his raising the point, of uQv- aiwao mica we wished set aside, in accordance with 9 the undertaking given by the Company in connection with the assignment of the Concession in 1930, for lending ground and seaplane sites. We are not yet in a position ho dispose of this point, hut I am inclined to think that it would be preferable to send in our mining lease amendments now without further delay and risk an enquiry from the Company on the question of the landing ground and seaplane sites. If we should feel bound for any reason to aaVj.se uie Sheikh to reject the application which has now oeen riB.de by the Company for an extension of their prospecting licence the point would of course be of immedJ&amp;te importance, since the longer notice we give the Company the more chance we have of securing early amendments in the mining lease which they would in that Starling, Esq., event/ Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley street, S.W. 1.event take out on 2nd December next. But even if the Sheikh is to accept their present application it would, I think, be well to let Bellantyne know without delay what modifications we want, so that we can if necessary advise the Sheikh to ask the Company for an understanding that they will be sympathetically considered as part of the consideration for the grant by him of the further extension. 2. I now attach a draft letter to Ballantyne, covering a draft schedule of the amendments and additions which we suggest, ^ill you be so kind as to let me know whether you concur in the draft end in the schedule or have any observations to offer on either ? As you will see, I have suggested that he and 1 should talk over the possible modification of Article IX. On this point the letter to him is, I think, generally consistent with the line agreed at our meeting on 27th September as set out in paragraph 13 of the record. 3. The list of amendments to be suggested to the Company contains no reference to the right of preemption in time of war. This is as agreed/-o- ^141 j&amp;O h ^ Z'' 0 agreed at our meeting on 27th September (record, paragraph 37). Neither does it contain any reference to the ref ining of oil in Bahrein or in British territory, and I shall be glad of your views on this point. At the meeting of 27th September the suggestion was put forward that we might, when informing the Company of our mining lease desiderata say thst the Sheikh had been enquiring as to the arrangements proposed end was anxious that the oil should be refined in Bahrein. We referred the matter to the Political Resident in our telegram No.2438 of 3rd October. Colonel Loch's reply (telegram No.928 of 17th October) stated that he had himself fomed the impression that the Company proposed to refine at any rate a proportion of their output locally and made it clear that the Sheikh had always looked forward, to a large refinery in Bahrein which would give employment to his people. He added however that Gastrell now seemed less certain about this. The general position in regard to refining is examined in detail in your subsequent letter to me, P.D.21, of 30th October, of which copies were sent to India and Bushire/Bushire by the Air Mail of 3rd. November. In the light of that detailed examination the probability that the Company will refine a material proportion of their output locally seems a strong one. Subject to your views and those of the other Departments, I am on the whole therefore inclined to say nothing on this point to Ballantyne at the present stage (unless of course in the course of conversation an opening offers itself). We have already suggested that Loch should take the opportunity of the Company's present request for an extension to make further soundings discreetly, and if he finds this possible the position may be clearer. If the result of such soundings or of any other information was to make it clear that the Company do not intend to refine in Bahrein, it would I think be quite possible for us to say to Ballantyne that we had always assumed that, in accordance with the normal practice of oil companies, the Company proposed to refine locally; that this had been the consistent assumption of the Sheikh, who attached great importance to it; that we had regarded it as so much a matter of course tnat we had not included it in our list of requirements; but that now that there seemed some uncertainty on the point we thought it better to put it beyond question? 4. On a last point, as explained above, we are not in a position yet to let the Company know the precise areas we want for the landing ground and seaplane sites.sites. I do not think it is really vital that this should be covered in the mining lease itself so long as we get an exchange of letters which will bind the Company. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office end Moore at the Admiralty for their consideration. We might, 1 think,aim at getting the letter off to Ballantyne if possible on Friday. As you know, the Company now hint that failing a decision on their application for a further extension by 15th November they may have to reconsider their position, and it would, I think be well to get our amendments in without delay. Yours sincerely, J.G.LAITHWAITS.SI DRAFT LETTER. .R f Ballantyne, Esq., Bahrein Petroleum ^0 • Ltd • y 19, Moorgate, E .G. 2. / Dear Mr. Ballantyne, You will remember that during our conversation on 21st September we discussed the question of the amendments desired in the Bahrein f Petroleum Company's Mining Lease ^ I promised to let you have details of these amendments at a very early date. I am sorry that there has 'been so much delay and that 1 am only now in a position to write to you on the subject. 2. I enclose herewith a schedule of the amendments in question. For convenience 1 have divided them into three heads. The first head covers the amendments which are for practical purposes already agreed with the Company, viz, an amendment to give effect to the provisions of the assignment of the Eastern and General Syndicate's concession on 12th June 1930 in so far as the Mining Lease is itrJ concerned, and an amendment making provision for measuring crude oil won for purposes of royalty assessment, and for the keeping of accounts by the Company, following on the amendments on that point made by agreement between us in the prospecting licence early this year. You will remember that at that/a. that time the Company were willing iiBnedlately to nBke the corresponding amendment in the Mining Lease, hut that we thought it better to leave all the Mining Lease amendments to he dealt with comprehensively. 3. The second head covers proposed modifications in specific articles of the Mining Lease, and the third certain additions which we should like to see made to the lease. As you will see, the modifications and additions in question are for the most part directed to cringing the Mining Lease into closer conformity with ordinary oilfield practice; and we trust that the Company will find no difficulty in agreeing to their acceptance. The precise drafting of the various amendments, including in particular those contained in the first category ahove, might form the subject oi aiscussion between us. Perhaps the simplest course would be that the Company should propose a draft which could be considered here? 4. In addition to the amendments set out in the schedule trie re is one other point which we might if you agree perhaps more conveniently in the first instance discuss orally, and that is the desirability of some modification of Article IX, bearing on the date from which/3. which the annual payment of Rs.30,000 shall become payable to the Sheikh. We have no desire to press the Company unduly on tills and the Sheikh has of course trie right in c ertain circumstances to appeal to arbitration if he is dissatisfied. But we are of opinion that some modification of the Article as it stands, to be reached by agreement between us, might make for smoother working without materially affecting the financial interests of the Company, and if you agree we might talk this over./ / UiAFT Schedule of^amendments etc. proposed in trie ivJ-niru Le ase appena ea as' Scneaule HI to tne Gil Concession ra ntedr'Dy~'the Sheikn oi Banrein to tlie Eastern and General S.ynaicate on ^d DecemberTU25 .

B. Miscellaneous amendments in mdiviQuaT''Articles T' Ar t icle 1 . After the words 'sueh right however shall not include the exclusive right to sell such products within the leased area' it is desired to insert the following amendment 'The lessees shall at their own expense forthwith erect and at all times maintain and keep in repair substantial boundary marks at the corners of the leased area, according to the demarcation shown in the plan hereto annexed/2. annexed, so that the 'boundaries of the leased area may at all times 'be clearly defined.' article ii « Penultimate paragraph.

Skinner's letter to Hi&amp; Britannic Majesty^ Political i^eno, Baarein, dated the 21st October. In his covering letter to me, Mr. Skinner explains that the suggested offer was discussed in some detail with the Political Agen'o, Banrein and the Financial adviser to the Bahrein Gbvernment. He was informed, apparently, that while the Financial Adviser, and the Political Agent could discuss the offer with the Snexkh of Baiirein, tney were not at liberty to advise Mr. Skinner whether or not it was acceptable until the terms had been made known to the Political Resident at Bucliire, and probably to other Officials of the India Office. Alao, that neither the Political Agent nor the Financial Adviser felt that they could open the subject with the Political Befcident without having some sort of written offer from Tue Bahrein Petroleum Oo. Licl . Accordingly, Mr. Skinner made what he calls 'an informal tentative offer' in writing to the Political A^ent, which was to be followed by u a formal legal offer', if acceptable, for the reason that neither the Political Agent nor the Financial Aavicer could take any action on a verbal offer. Tuo* news received by cable from Mr. o^inner to—day was to the effect that the offer was passed on to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 28th October and the Sheikh of Bahrein had not made anv answer up to the time oi cabling. I have cabled to Mr. Skinner this afternoon informing him/him that I understand the Political Agent will receive an enquiry from London as to the position, and asking him to consider making a request for a definite answer before the 15th instant.

Will you please advise His Excellency Shaikh Hamad that I have telegraphed all details of the matter to both our San Francisco and London Offices, and in order to allow time for their answer to His Excellency's offer to extend the Prospecting License for one month to January 2, 1934, we will hold our offer open until the 21st of November, 1933, instead of the 18th of November, 1933, as was advised in my letter of ?Sovember 16, 1933.

' We are making preliminary plans for shipping oil through a submarine line which will run from a base on Sitra Island to the deep water just outside the entrance to Khor v r Kaliya. We plan to have ships enter this deep water anchorage by approaching the south-east comer of tiie Island of Munarraq, and trom there passing down the deep water channel on the eastern side of Muharraq# A certain number of buoys will be necessary to mark the channel) also detailed soundings will be needed to make certain tnere are no shoals or sand banks. Recently,H.M.S Ormonae did some very detailed work in this particular area,and I am wondering if it would be possible for us to obtain the full detail of their work without waiting for it to appear in print on the regular Admiralty chart forms. Also do you think the s.s ? Nearchus ? would consider making a marine survey for us,if this is necessary in addition to the information from H.M.S Ormonde? Would they consider setting tne channel buoys? Could you advise me what permits,both from His Majesty^ Government and from the Local Authorities,would be required before we could undertake such a survey and install the necessary marine facilities. I have some maps and charts partially covering this entire matter,and also considerable data which we have already worked up,and would be pleased to discuss all of this with you at any time.a I A,' .'ill' J / syf &gt; Xb D«0»No:G/516.

Novoinber 19, 1933. His Britannic Majesty's Politioal Agent Bahrein, Dear Sir: Confirming my letter of 18th of November, 1933, which was in answer to your letter No, C/515-10/l # T»- Although your understanding of the terms of our offer for an extension of the Prospecting License by 13 months was substantially correct, the method and time of payments is slightly different than you stated. I am enclosing a proposed Supplementary Agreement covering the entire matter in detail, which Agreement we would expect to be signed if His Excellency Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifah accepts our offer. It is my understanding that the payments in installments, as specified, will be more satisfactory to the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Oovemment than the payments in a lump sum, and my Instructions are that the payments shall be in such installments. I am further instructed to inform you that the Company is not in favor of His Bxeellency Shaikh Hamad f s offer to extend the prospecting license for one month, because if no result is reached within that time it would lead to disappointment, and that such extension is not good in principle. They have asked me to explain to everyone concerned that friendliest co-operation is desired and hasty discussion on one definition apart from consequential and other alterations which might be proposed to the Mining Lease, is impracticable and likely to lead to embarrassment of everyone. For this reason, they do not wish at this time to discuss the definition of 'oil in commercially exploitable quantities'. Although willing to consider alterations mentioned above, the Company Is not bound in principle to accept or make any alterations, but our idea Is to embrace practical politics rather than to stand on the strict letter of the law. We now consider that we have made a very handsome offer, and such offer can only be held open until 6 P .M. November 21, 1933.

C' i ii 0 Dear Lalthwalte, ' With reference to Powle's telegraci, 928, of the 17tii October regarding tne refining of Bahrein oil, It Is difficult for me to believe that the Company woula ship the crude half round the worla to the refineries belonging to the Standard OH Company of California, which are all situated in California (except a small one in Texas) where the Company already has a production of 5,000,000 tons of oil. The distance from Bahrein to California, going East via Singapore ana the Pacific, is approximately 10,970 miles. The other route, going West via the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, would be about 12,700 miles, but this would Involve the transit of both the Suez and Panama Canals and involve the payment of heavy dues. MDreover, there is a high tariff in the United States which effectively shuts out crude oil from much nearer sources than Bahrein. In fact it is possibly due in some measure to this tariff that the standard Oil Company of California is looiclng for sources of oil nearer the markets in which it can be sold. Existing refineries actually nearest to Bahrein are at Abadan, Suez and Rangoon. The distances are approximately 400, 3200 and 3500 miles respectively. Apart from/ ithwalte, E sq., iia Office, S .wo 1.- 2 - 6 m from a small refinery iDelonging to the Egyptian Government at Suez and two small refineries at Hangoon belonging to independent companies, all the refining capacity at the places mentioned is in the hands of the Anglo-Persian, Burmah and Shell Groups, which woula not be likely to help the Standard Oil Company of California with the aisposal of Bahrein oil. One obvious market for Bahrein oil is India, with its large native demand for kerosene and growing requirements of petrol and fuel oil occasioned by rapid road and inaustrial development. But this is a market for refined oils ana the usual practice is to build a refinery on or near the oilfield. The standard Oil Company of California sent substantial quantities of crude oil to Japan in 1931. This was probably for refining in Japan for the Japanese Navy, and although regarded as somewhat of an unusual transaction, we know that Japan is very anxious to secure other sources of supply of crude oil. The distance from Bahrein to Japan would be about 7,000 miles as compared with only 4,b00 from Sam Francisco. If the Company find oil in Hasa, they will need a refinery also for that oil. All this serves to show that we are on quite strong ground in pressing for refining in Bahrein. It is up to them to say how such a proposal would inflict hardship on them. I am sending copies of this letter to Moore and Warner. Yours sincerely, (3d.) F.C. STARLING. 'ItlKi i! 1 in P.Z.

Beaiaafeyne, You will TGmejber that during our converBation on 21st September we di -cusped the question of the amendments desired in the Bahrein Petroleum Company* s Mining Lease, when I promised to let you have details of these amendments at a very early date. I am sorry that there has been so much delay and that I am only now in a position to write to you on the subject. 2, I enclose herewith a schedule of the amendments in question. For convenience I have divided them into three heads. The first head covers the amendments which are for practical purposes already agreed with the Company, viz. an amendment to give effect to the provisions of the assignment of the Eastern and General Syndicate's concession on 12th June 1930 in so far as the Mining Lease is concerned, and an amendment making provision for measuring crude oil won for purposes of royalty assessment, and for the keeping of accounts by the Company, following on the amendments on that point made by agreement between R.Ballantyne, Esq., us/ &gt;3hrem Petroleum Co. ,Ltd., 19, Moorgate, E.C.2 J!us in the prospecting licence early this year. -ou will remember that at that time the Company were willing % immediately to make the corresponding amendment in the Mining Lease, but that we though it better to leave all the Mining Lease amendments to be dealt with comprehensively. 3. The second head covers proposed modifications in specific articles of the Mining Lease, and the third certain additions which we should like to see made to the lease. As you will see, the modifications and additions in question are for the most part directed to bringing the Mining Lease into closer conformity with ordinary oilfield practice; and we trust that the Company will find no difficulty in agreeing to their acceptance, The precise drafting of the various amendments, including in particular those contained in the first category above, might form the subject of discussion between us. Perhaps the simplest course would be that the Company should propose a draft which could be considered here? 4. In addition to the amendments set out in the schedule the Sheikh has raised in connection witn your Company's application for en extension of tneir prospecting licence/t) - 3 - licence the question of 'commercial exploitable quantities' in Article IX, and we shall have to discuss this further.

India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.I. Co^( sent to.Z. 7385/33• THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED, 19 MOORGATE, LONDON, E.G.2 14th November 1933. Dear Mr. ^aitbmite. I have to acknowledge receipt of your istter of the 11th instant (Reference P.Z.7189/33) and its ^ ao«ompanying enclosure, both of which are being forwarded to San Francisco by this evening's mail. To deal with Clause 4 of your letter, I have to confirm what I told you over the telephone this moridng, namely:- I have this morning received instructions from the Company to inform you that if it will help matters the Company will give the Sheikh oi Bahrein such assurances as he may be advised to accept, that the minimum royalty of Rs.30,000 would commence at the expiration of two years after the commencement of the Mining Lease. This is not to be treated as a part of the compensation for the extension of the Prospecting Licence and is to be dealt with as an agreed modification of the form of Les.se, It does not follow from the foregoing that there is any alteration in the period during which the Corcpaiiy ks at liberty to declare whether or not oil has been found in 'coranercially exploitable quantities'. As the Company understands the position, the Sheikh of Bahrein wants to have the assurance that ne will have a minimum income commencing in, say roughly, three years' time and this is the assurance which the r .Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I Company/ / ^ ^■ ; S) - 2 - Corrpany is prepared to give. If the Lease is not taken up, or if it is abandoned prior to the arrival of the time of the payment of the minimum royalty, then, naturally, the Sheikh receives no portion of the minimum royalty of Rs,30,000. Mr. Skinner is receiving cabled instructions today to make this further concession by the Company clear to the Sheikh of Bahrein and to lodge his application for the Lease on the 18th instant if he has not received by then the asked for acceptance of the Company's applicetaon for the thirteen months' extension of the Prospecting Licence. The Company trusts that the Sheikh of Bahrein and his Advisers will not assume from the foregoing that they are being rushed into s.. decision without having had an opportunity for due consideration*, as the company sees the position, it is that the offer for cash it has made cannot be increased. The Company has accepted the desire of the Sheikh of Bahrein to have the assurance of a fixed royalty within a specified time and therefore it is only left now for the Sheikh of Bahrein to decide wnether or not he will accept the cash oifer, an offer which has been before him now for three weeks.

Alter consultation vvith the interested Departments in the light oi the views expressed in Colonel Fowle's -telegrain of 10th NovemDer, T.99, I explained the position in regard to the extension of the prospecting licence briefly 'by telephone to Mr. Ballantyne this morning, when he asked if he could come to discuss the position further this afternoon. Amendments in Mining: Lease . 2. Mr. Ballantyne on arrival said that he had received the India Office letter of 11th November,, No .P. Z.7189/33, covering a schedule of the amendments desired in the Bahre in Petroleum Company's mining lease, and stating that the Sheikh had raised the question of 'commercial exploitable quantities' in Article IX of the raining lease in connection with the extension of the prospecting licence. The proposed amendments in the mining lease must of course be communicated for consideration to San Francisco. This would be done at once. I said we appreciated that reference to San Francisco would be necessary. Extension of Prospecting Licence . 3. we then turned to the question of the Sheikh's reaction to the Company's proposals in regard to the extension of the prospecting licence. I said in the first place that, as I had already explained to him by telephone/telephone, the Bssiaent naa impressed, upon us that the Company must hear in mind that they were dealing not with a business concern hut with an Arah sheikh, who required ample time for consultation. We could confirm the impor uance ox avo iuing any appeal ance ox uryixi^ uO rush matters from our own experience in questions of a different character with rulers such as the Sheikh of Bahrein. Mr. Ballantyne said that he quite understood that the Shexkii uid no o wisn uo Go xusheu and tnat the Company would uncie r s tjanu it also, un uie o olier ha a id tliey regarded themselves as having a good record in this matter. The question of the extension of the prospecting licence naci 'been under consideration j - oi ^uitc a xon 0 time and they did not think that it was their fault (though he admitted that there were certain extraneous circumstances which might have had some weight in the matter) if the time was now as short as it was oefore Decerrfoer 2nd. I said that we could not accept that view. Had it not he en for the unfortunate inciaents which had arisen in connection with Iv&amp;jor Holmes' negotiations in the spring, this matter could have he en settled at a much earlier date. At the same time, just as it was undesirahle to endeavour to rush the Sheikh into any premature decision, so there was no 'desire so xar at. we were concerned in the matter to be unreasouahle. The Company had until the 2nd December to make up their minds If they thought that a short further pex iod would eass matters we should he quite ready to recommend to the Sheikh ane xtension of the period ox the prospecting licence, perhaps for a fortnight, out at any rate not beyond the end of the present calendar year, for the purpose of negotiation only. An extension to the end ox the/- 3 - the present calendar year would be an extension for practical purposes of s. month. Any such extension would, of course, he subject to whatever legal formalities were necessary, and also to the understanding that it would form part of any extension of the prospecting licence which might be granted as the result of negotiation. Mr. Ballantyne said that no difficulty should arise on the question of legal formalities and that he would hear in mina our readiness to meet the Company on this point and would inform San Francisco accordingly. 4. I then saia that, as already explained to him hy telephone, we understood that the sheikh regarded the financial offer put forward oy the Company as unsatisfactory. He (Mr. Ballantyne) had previously heen warned that in our judgment the reduced offer of Rs.l lakh which had he en made to the Sheikh was less likely to prove acceptable to him than the figure of Rs.1,50,000 which had originally been mentionea. I was not at liberty to give him details of the financial terms on which the Sheikh was preparea to consider trie Company's proposals. These would be communicated direct through the Poliuica,! Agent to Mr. skinner. 5. Mr. Ballantyne saia that he would await the details promised on this point. He was more concerned immediately on the Question of 'commercial exploitaole Quantities' and would be glad to know what the Sheikn's point was on this. I said that I wished first to explain that in my letter of 11th November, P•Z«7189/33, I hau referred to the sheikh as having raised this question in connection with Article IX of the mining lease, //e had not actually yet had the text of the Sheikh^ letuer and did not know what phrase he had used. But the Resident's telegram had not/not in fact referred to the Stieikh as raising the question in connection with any particular Article of the mining lease, ana the phrase occurred six times altogether in the mining lease. On the other hand, Article IX (with which possibly article X ought to be bracketed) was, as I thought Mr. Ballantyne woula agree ? the material article of the mining lease and it was this reason that reference had been made to it in my letter. Mr. Ballantyne said that he understood the position. Secondly, we were not quite clear as to what was in the Sheikh* 3 mind, but so far as we could judge on the information available to us he was interested in two points: (a) a definition of the phrase; (b) the question of the earliest date at which the royalty of Hs.30,000 would become payable. 6. Mr. Ballantyne would appreciate that under the mining lease as it stood the Sheikh, unless there was a declaration of production in commercially exploitable quantities at an earlier period than 5 years, could not hope until that 5 years had elapsed for larger royalties than Ks. 10,000 per annum, lhat might hcive been a reasonable figure and a reasonable understanding at the time when the agreement was first drafted in 1925. But matters had advanced since then and it was Quite clear that the prospects of finding oil in Bahrein were probably substantially more important now than they had been at that aate. It was only natural in these circumstances that the sheikh, before wishing to conmit himself on the matter of the further extension, should want to know where he stood on this question. He had, of course, the right in certain circumstances to appeal to/ •Mi' 'd8/ to arbitration 11 he was dissatisfied, out we thought his spontaneous raising of the point was understandable, and had ourselves quite independently formed the opinion that some mociiiication of the provisions of the lease on this point might make for smoother working without very materially affecting the financial interests of the Company. We could give him technical advice on the question of definition: out if the Company were disposed to meet him, e.g. by agreeing that the minimum period under Article IX should be reduced to say Z years, the question of definition might be less important to the Sheikh. 7. Mr. Ballantyne said that he had tnougho tnis was what the Sheikh had in mind, ana was not surprised that the point should have oeen raised. Speaking peisonally, he i elt little douot tnat ohe uompany v/oulu us pi d pa red. to give full weight to any viev/ expressed by Ub in the matter, and that some arrangement might be possiole of a nature satisfactory to al1 par ties. &amp;u- he 111oaght, anu felt that the Company would think the same, that the point was one which ought properly to oe raised in connection with the amendments in trie mining lease and not as a condition of an extension oi the prospecting licence. He felt hiiiiself, in tne light of the sheikh s reaction, that the Company would probably not be prepared to improve their offer and would wish to take out their mining lease on 2nd Decemoer. They //ere in a position to do so ii necessary, out h&amp; muse of course take their instructions and he would caoie ^an Francisco this afternoon on the position generally in the- light of our conversation.8. I said tnat it vvas entirsly ior tlie Gonipany to decide whether or not to take out the mining lease on 2nd December, and that he wouid no doubt let us know once- he had been able to take their instructions. He was now aware of our attitude in regard to a possible short extension for trie purpose of negotiation, but if the Company decided to take out the mining lease without further delay we, of course, coula raise no objection to their aoing so. 9. Mr. Ballantyne then turned to my earlier statement that we were asking the Resident to authorise the communication of the Sheikh 1 s comments to Mr. Skinner, and saici that he hoped we would think it unnecessary to raise the question of commercial exploitable quantities in any communication on behalf of the sheikh to Mr. skinner. He thought Mr. skinner had been rather hardly used in being reQuirea to put iorward in writing an offer (even though a tentative one) on behalf 01 the Company and he was averse himself irom making this Question of commercial exploitable Quantity the subject of a formal communication. 10. I said we coula not agree as to this. It would have been Quite impossible foi trie polit±oai i^ent to make himself responsible for passing on an oral oner to the sheikh in a matter of such importance as the present ana he was clearly entirely right in requiring Mr*, skinner to put his proposals in writing, me xoim in which those proposals had oeen put j-orward seemed to me a quite reasonable compromise from tne point oi view oi the Company. Equally it would oe impossiolt; a-or U q to agree that the Sheikh's reaction to theii oifer ohould not be communicated to Mr. Skinner, ihe oxxbv had u^en made/; | \ ' J V 6 - 7 i made tnrough the Chiei LoGcil Representative, and the Sheikh's reply to it must he macie through hlin, we to consider not merely tne Sheikh's position in the matter, but also our own. It would clearly 'be most unsatisfactory irorn our point of view, as well as from that of the Sheikh, if the Company were, as Mr. Ballantyne had rather nin ued was possit) 1 e, not to withdraw. an offer made in writing through Mr. skinner in Bahrein and decide to take out their mining lease on 2nd December on the strength of conversations in London as to the Sheikh 1 s reaction to the offer made by Mr. skinner and without any formal direct reply to Mr. Skinner on behalf ol tne Sheikh. While the Sheikh had asked for our advice, and we had taken advantage of this to give Mr. Ballantyne an outline of his views, we had no intention of dispensing with a formal reply to Mr. skinner which we would to-day advise the Sheikh to send. 11. After some further discussion Mr. Ballantyne (who for some reason which was not clear appeared to attach importance to avoiding any written communication, at any rate as regards commercial exploitable quantity, from the Sheikh) abandoned his point. 13th November 1935.

Baliantyna rang up to say that he had received a caole dat6d iDth Novenlber from Ivir • skinner to the effect that he had received, from the Political Agent, BaJarein (either to-day or last night) three letters addressed by the Sheikh to the Political Agent on the subject of the Company f s application for an extension of their prospecting licence. The first, dated 3nd November, stated that he would he prepared to consider the extension if the whole sum of Rs.l lakh was non-recoverable. This was the only stipulation. The second, dated 2nd November, said that he had asked the British Government for a definition of commercially exploitable quantities. The third, dated ord November, stated that before considering the extension of the prospecting licence he wished to be clear on the point ' raised in the second letter. No mention was made in any of the letters of the rate of minimum royalty. Mr. Bailantyne said he found himself in a position of some embarrassment. He had already instructed Mr. skinner that the Company would make no further financial advance and that they were, on the other hand, prepared to meet the sheikh over tne matter of the minimum,royalty. He was now faced with this demand for an [extra) 75,000 rupees in[cashjand was frankly at a loss to know what reply to send to Mr. skinner. He did not suggest that we had any knowledge of the existence of these letters, but it would have been a great help to the Company if they had known, so long as a fortnight ago. what/what the Sheikh's reactions were, 3. I said that his news was news to us, hut that I thought the situation was as ioiiowsi- I had told hini at our interview on tonuay that we should ask! the political lie si dent to instruct the Political Agent at once to conmunicate the .Sheikh's reactions to the Company's offer to hx, skinner. Tnat presuirably / accounted ior the letter of 15th November^ I had also told him that we were unahla to give him details of the Sheikh* s ilnancial criticisms, 'but 1 coulci now tell him tnat they had included the request that the whole sum of Es»l lakh should be non-recoverable. There had since been certain further developments in tnis matter with which I need not trouble him. Finally, on the question of the commercially exploitable quantities, I had explained to him 121 at we did not quite know what was in the Sheikh's mind; that he had asked us for a definition of 'commercially exploitable quantity' and that we thought that he was interested in this matter from two points of view: (a) definition, since the phrase occurred some sis times in the mining lease; (b) the effect of the phrase in the lease on the commencement of his royalties at the rate of Rs.30,000. I had adaed that while we did not know what was in his mind it was conceivable that if the Company were to meet him over the question of royalty, say by reducing the period to two years, the question of definition might assume less importance from his point of view, 4, The Company had subsequently intimated that they were not prepared to make any further financial concession/- 3 - concession, but had oilereci to pay the Hs.30,000 royalty as from the end of the second year of the mining lease. Mr. Skinner would presumably by now have so informed the Sbeikii, but we had no information as to what the Sheikh 1 s reaction to this modification of the terns might be. A telegram which had since been received, however, had made it clear to us that the question of commercial (ififinition was one to which he might attach great importance ana that it would not be altogether disposed of by a modification in respect of royalties. So far as I coula understand without a technical knowledge of these matters, the Sheikh was disturbed because of the absence in the mining lease of any clauses governing the date of the declaration of commercial productivity, and was no doubt disturbed lest the Company should postpone the declaration for a considerable period of time to his detriment, I understood that it was usual in oil concessions such as the present to cover this point, either by provision for a test of wells on an accepted basis to yield a minimum output or by the provision of a dead rent so heavy as to make it in the Company's interest to declare commercial production at an early date. The mining lease contained at present no reference to a test; while Mr. Ballantyne would agree that the dead rent of, Ks.30,000 was far too low to make a delay in the declaration of commercial proauction oi much concern to the Company. Xhe sheikh's interest in the question of definition was therefore not unnatural. 5. . Mr. Ballantyne said that discussion of the amendment of the mining lease to meet the Dheikh s difficulty as regards definition might lead us down a lengthy and difficult path and would certainly take time'.^/He did not, it may be added, rule out the possibility of discussion of it later, and 'before the conversation ended I again emphasised its great importance from the 1 standpoint of the Sheikh. The wording of paragraph 4 of the India Office letter of 11th November, P.Z.7189/33, to III Mr. Ballantyne allords a peg on which to hang a proposal to the Company for a provision in the Mining Lease to cover definition7. 5. He finally stated that he would telegraph again to Mr. Skinner tonight and see what developments there had oeen, and that we might discuss the natter further tomorrow. 1 emphasised that if he could authorise Mr. Skinner to reassure the Sheikh as to the definition of commercial production, which it was clear was a point to which he attached real weight, it might facilitate a decision in the Company's favour as regards the extension of the prospecting licence.

My dear Starling, In confirmation of our conversation this morning I enclose a copy of a note of a furtner telephone conversation to-day with Ballantyne vvnioh is, I think, self -explanatory. He subsequently rang up, as arranged, to say that after further consideration of the representations which had heen made to him the company would be prepared; - (a) as a final financial concession to agree to increase the non- recoverahle portion of the loan of 1 lakli^uD he made to the Sheikh to Hs. 50,000, the extra Rs .^,000 to he allotted either to the State or to the SheiKh's private purse, as te* might think desirable. He suggested tnat if it was allotted to the Sheikh's private purse it might he preferable that it should oe pai^ over a certain period in instalments; (b) to agree to the political Resident being informed that the desirability of an amendment in the mining lease on the question of the de-iinxuion c o mm ercially/ ^•Starling, Esq., Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, s. W. 1 • /iCcoiiimercially exploitaMe quantities had been strongly pressed upon them; that they were prepared to consider very seriously an aniendnient to this effect, together with the other amendments in the mining lease which had already heen put to them; that it was at the same time in their view Quite impractical) le to dispose 01 amendments of this nature at such short notice; that they appreciated at the same time that it was to the interests as little of the Company as H.M.G. that relations with the Sheikh should not he cordial; that the Company had no intention of standing on the strict letter of the law; and that they trusted that a statement on these lines would reassure the sheikh. 2. Mr. Ballantyne added that he would to-day send instructions as ahove en clair to Mr. Skinner and said that he sincerely hoped that the advance represented uy this latest action of the Company would have the desired effect. He strongly emphasised in conversauion that the Company woula he very reluctant to enter on their mining lease leaving in the minds of HJvLG. and/or the Sheikh a feeling that they had taken an unfair advantage or were teha.ving unreasonably.D 3. We have telegraphed to Fowle to let him know these further advances. Copies of the telegram will be distributed in the ordinary way. we have promised to follow up our telegram with a further telegram giving the gist of. your advice on the point raised in his telegrajn •106 of 16th November and we propose (unless any unexpected development takes places) to add to our telegram that having regard to the further advance made by the Company we think the sheikh can reasonably be recommended to agree to the extension for thirteen months desired by them. 4.

NOIB OP A mSPHONB GONV^SAflON wiffi MR, BALLANTYl^S ON IHE 16th NOVEMBSB. Consequent on the receipt of Colonel Powle's iK telegram No.T. 106 of 16th November I rang up ivir.Ballantyne M and said tnat we had haa this morning a further telegram from the political Besident which emphasised the importance attached by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the question of the definition of commercial exploitable quantities. I did 'i not know whether he haa been able to think of any method of reassuring the Sheikh on this. It was quite clear that it might he a real stumbling block in the way of any extension. Mr. Ballantyne said that he did not find it easy to appreciate tne Sheikh's difficulty on the point. He had thought that the step actually taken in regard to the royalties payable under the mining lease should have reassured him. I would agree that the question of making an amendment to cover the present point in the mining lease in the short time nov/ available would be almost out of the question. The amendments we had already suggested had been communicated to the Company: he would not guarantee that the Company would accept all or any of them ana they might, of course, have counter amendments of their own to suggest. The amendments in the mining lease ought to be dealt with comprehensively and he thought it almost impossible that any guarantee could be got from the Company to accept an amendment 01 tne type we now had in mind at such short notice. 3/3. 1 said that ws did not agree that the amendment was 01 acadeiriic importance only ana repeated the explanation I had given him on this point, as recorded in the note of rriy conversation with him on the 15th ^overnher, i\u* P» Z»7421/ / 3o, para^ra^ii 4;» Secondly &gt; on the Question of time it was only fair to let him know that my authorities were inclined to think that we were heing unfairly rushed by the Company over matters of considerahle importance. The Sheikh was not unlikely to feel the same. The Company would no douht hear in mind that if the sheikh felt that he was being unreasonably pressed it might have very awkward reactions on the position of the Company's vvhole concession and agreement. I did not wish to develop that point, however. He would remember that we had indicated our readiness to recommend the Sheikh to grant a short further extension of the prospecting licence for the purpose of negotiation onI&gt; Y/ould it not really be better for the Company to consider this suggestion further? 4. Mr. Ballantyne said that it would certainly take more than a month to deal with the amendments which were now before the Company and that this question ought really to be considered with them. He did not think that an extension such as we suggested would be of any real value. He wished to say that the Company had no desire to aaopt an unreasonable attitude and he thought that we had not found them unreasonable or disposed to Quibble. It might well he, of course, that they would declare commercial production within twelve months. On the other hand the declaration might have to be delayed much longer. He was fully alive to the unaesirability of doing anything which/ Bi V .1which would produce an unsatisfactory impression on the gheikh. At the same time he was still inclined to think the point in issue not one of real substance and found it difficult to consider in what manner the Sheikh could he reassured. There would he no point, for instance, in leading the Sheikh to entertain hopes which it might prove impossible to realise on any point in connection with the amendments in the mining lease. I repeated that, whether rightly or wrongly, the Sheikh was obviously very suspicious on this particular point and that it was of importance from the Company's point of view to reassure him. I suggested that Mr. Ballantyne should think over the matter further and let me know in the course of the morning whether he could make any suggestion to which we could refer in replying to the Political Resident. 5. He replied that he saw great difficulty in the way, but would consider the matter further* He then hinted at the possibility of some advance (by way of soothing the Sheikh) to meet H.E.'s request for a more generous financial concession^ I did not enter into this, but said we trusted he might find it possible to put forward &amp; proposal which would advance matters. i y INDIA OFFICE. 16th November 1933.

PSTROLSUM DiiPAKTMENT, (WilNSS DJSPAEJCMENT), DSAII STANLEY STRSfiT, MILLBANK, S.W.I. 16th November, 1933. 4 Dear Laithwalts, With reference to Powle's telegram of 16th November (T.106) the basis of jrticles IX and X is that at some period not more thai five years after the grant of the mining lease the Company is required to make a declaration that oil has been found in 'commercially exploitable quantities'. Nothing is said about ability to dispose of the oil. As the draft lease stands the declaration determines the time when the minimum payment to be made by the Company shall be increased from R b .10,000 to Re. 30,OOO and this presumably is the main reason for the provision. There is no specific provision that having made the declaration the Company shall produce oil on a commerciel scale. It is conceivable that an Arbitrator asked to consider this question might read into the first two lines of Article X. that when the declaration has been made the Company can reasonable be expected to start 1 ; - - commercial production. .hat should constiiu'-ias commarcial production it would be difficult to say. Apart from the question of the general state oi the world demand for oil, which Colonel Fowle raises, the question of how and where the oil could be disposed of would arise. The Company might claim that they must ship the crude oil as there is no substantial local market and it would not pay them to erect a refinery. For this they would have to make suitaole shipping facilities. Or they might state that the only practicable method would be to build a refinery 1; ^ sell the refined products. To build a refinery would require time and the Company might argue that it would not pay c, them(l{v) -^0 them to build a refinery unless they had an assured production of a certain amount. On this the Petroleum Department could produce evidence based on other concessions where a provision had been made that a refinery must be erected when the production over a period of, say, six months reached an annual rate of 100,000 tons. Two or three decent oil wells could quite easily produce that quantity. It would obviously be very difficult to insert a provision in an oil lease to the effect that the lessee shall produce a specified minimiam quantity of oil, even if it could be proved that that quantity of oil was readily available. On the other hand it may be argued that a lessee having acquired a concession and proved oil in commercially exploitable quantities cannot in equity retain the concession and decline to proceed to commercial production. If conditions are such that the lessee does not consider it profitable to work the oil he should either give up the concession or pay a reasonable amount to the lessor. In the draft lease the minimum rent of Rs .30 ,000 payable after the declaration was presumably accepted by the ShBikh as the consideration he should get if corrmercial production did not take place, and it seems not unlikely that an Arbitrator would so decide. But generally the minimum royalty is of such dimensions as uO afford an inceptive to the lessee to proceed to commercial production. Clearly in this case it is not. It would be possible to test the real intentions 01 the Company by sag- gesting a larger minimum royalty. The oheikh, while he doubtless would prefer to have oil produced, witn all that its production implies in additional employment, etc., would presumably not wish to be unreasonable if there were in fact a surfeit of oil in the world markets, a iQ would be satisfied if he secured a minimum royalty of a reasonable&gt;^1 umiM—ifca— 3 .V Air Mil . f' 51 /-&gt; 1/ .•vA \\ f 'X P.Z.7457/35. dear Fowle, INDIA CPPICE, ffllTEHALL, S.W. 1. 17th November 1933. 1%* Many thanks for your confiiential d.o. of 51st October, No, 1782~S, about Bahrein oil. 2. As regards paragraph 2, I arn sorry that the record of the interview with Ballantyne dia not make the position clear. As explained in paragraph 7 of the Secretary of State's telegram No.2810 of 13th November, construction (a) is, of course, correct. We attach the greatest importance to maintaining the Political iigent as the sole channel for any comnunications, whether written or oral, between the Sheikh and/or his representatives and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, end would see very strong objection to any direct dealings with the Chief Local Representative. 3.

Yours sincerely, {/ LcuC Q &gt;BY 4TB MAIL. IHi)IA 0?PI CS, WHITEHALL. 17tb, November, 1933. My dear Powle, Would you kindly refer to paragraph 1 of the note of my conversation with Ballantyne on the 15th November, of which copies are sent by this week f s air mail under our No. P.Z, 7421/33? We have of course so far only Ballantyne^ account as therein recorded of the method in which the Sheikh^ views were communicated to the Chief Local Representative and it is possible that there may be some misunderstanding, particularly as it appears to be based merely on a telegram from Skinner. But by way of settling a procedure in future cases of this nature we should be glad if you would consider the following suggestions and let us know whether you see any objection to them, 2. Yle suggest that the simplest course would, if vou agree, be that the Sheikh should in the first place in asking for our advice, indicate his own reaction to the/ !he Hon'ble Lt.Col. T.G.W. Fowle, C^B.E., c/o Political A^ent, Bahrein.M' ' the proposition before him; that on the receipt of our advice he should further consider the position and should then (unless he wishes to refer further on any point to Hi^ Maie£ty ? s Government or the Resident) embody his final views in a comprehensive letter to the Political iigent. The Political Agenu would not pass on that letter in original to the Chief Local Representative, but would embody its substance (with any modifications that might be thought desirable - in the case of modifications of importance only, of course, with the Sheikh T s concurrence) in a letter under his own signature to the Representative stating that the Sheikh 1 2 views were as followed. This was the course which was adopted in August in connection with the Sheikh of Bcilirein f b refusal to grant a further extension of the prospecting licence (compare Gastrell's ^ letter of 21st August, Mo. 0.355, of which copies were sent under Bushire despatch of 29th August, No.ll29-S). ^ It hae, of course, the obvious advantage that it leaves the Company in the dark as to the original reaction of the Sheikh and the nature of any advice which may subsequently have been tendered to him by His Majesty's GrovernmenC%] (jovemment, and that it enables us if necessary to modify any feras of phrase in letters written by His ExGellency or the Financial Adviser which might give rise to misunderstanding or expose surface. (It might well have been slightly embarrassing in the present case had the suggestions in paragraph 4 of the Scorotary of State's telegram No.2810' dated 13th November been communicated to the Sheikh and had His Excellency then followed up his letters of ^nd and 3rd November by a further letter embodying them and communicated to the Company by the Political A^cnt, since it would probably have been fairly clear to the Company that those suggestions were suggestions put forward by His Majesty's Guvernment). As you know, the Foreign Office are most anxious to avoid any risk of trouble with the United States Oovemment over these Gulf oil concessions, and we feel sure you will agree that while maintaining as effective a control as possible the more we can keep the degree and nature of our interference/interference or of the advice which wc tender entirely under cover the better. 3.

IL • V Dear Mr. Ball ant yne, In the course of our discussion on 21st September I mentioned to you that some difficulty had arisen as between the Bahrein Government and the Bahrain Petroleum, Company oyer the interpretation of Clause V of p Sb', vV % D the First Schedule to the Bahrein Oil Concession of 2nd December 1925, and promised to write to you further on the matter, which you kindly said you would consider, I am sorry that I should have been so long in doing so. 2. The difficulty which has arisen is briefly explained in the letter to the Political Agent, Bahrein, from the Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government, dated 2nd August last, of which I enclose an extract. (The relevant clause, now that the Company are working under their prospecting license, is of course Clause VI of Schedule IL) The precise interpretation of the phrase 'office requirements' was not discussed in detail R.Ballanfcyne. Esq., , , , Wlth/ Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, 19, Moorgate, E .c ;2with the Eastern and General Syndicate when the Agreement of 1925 was drawn up, but in our view there is force in the contention put forward by-the Bahrein G-overnment (as we should certainly have made clear had the difficulty at the time been regarded of the completion of the Agreement as likely to arise), and we think it reasonable that household furniture (as distinct from ;, office requirements 1 '), refrigerators, soda water machines, phonographs, records and sporting goods should pay customs duty. The position as regards motor cars is perhaps more disputable. We feel a good deal of sympathy under this head with the Bahrein G-ovBrnment, On the other hand, if, as I imagine is the case, the cars are the Company's property, and if secondly they are used primarily or solely for transport of the Company's personnel to their work or if they are lorries for tne transport of material, we should be disposed to agree that on the wording of the clause as it stands there is some justification for a claim to exemption in respect of them. e 'i •PH3. Perhaps you would be so kind as to consider the matter, which we might, if you thought this would assist, discuss orally? HVvAimCopy extract letter from the Adviser to the Bahrain Govt, ' t0 2nd August 1 933, I enclose a list of imports which in the opinion of the Govei-nment are noo exempt from customs dues according to Clause V, Scneaule I, ox the Bahrein Oil Concession, which reads as follows:- ' ^ VV iree importation of materials, apparatus and machinery of every kind necessary for the work carried out oy the Company including office requirements, but not including the personal requirements of the employees'. The contention of the Government is that although these goods are the property of the Company, not of individual employees, they do. not form part of the 'materials, apparatus and machinery of every kind necessary for the i^iork carried out by the Company', neither are they 'office requirements' which are specified as not being liable for duty. Many of the items consist of furniture, linen etc.,etc,, used in the Manager T s house in Manamah and the Camp at Jebel Dukhan. Clause V specifically excludes 'office requirements' from liability of customs dues, it is presumed that 'office requirements' includes office furniture, typewriters, stationery etc., and if office furniture is specially mentioned as being free from liabi-iity it is presumed that furniture other than office furniture f is not free from liability. The Company in their letter dated January 31st,1933, addressed to me, of which a copy was sent to you, consider that because the goods imported are the property of the Company not of individual employees and because, in the Company x s opinion, they form part of the necessary equipment of the Company therefore they should be free from customs dues. The Government cannot accept the opinion of the Company that all goods, the property of the Company , which they may import and which they may consider necessary for the work, shall be free from customs dues because Clause V of the Concession particularly states that 'personal requirements' do not enjoy this immunity; further^jnore the mention of office requirements leads the Government to assume that other similar 'requirements' are liable to customs dues. Another fact which has some bearing ..on the matter is that the Company has always paid duty on food imported from abroad but this food is supplied to the employees free of charge. Food, furniture, motor cars used by individual members, gramophone records and refrigerators all appear to belong to the same category when defining 'personal require ments of employees' and are supplied freely to the employees, yet the Company admits that it is liable to pay customs dues on food, but not, for instance on gramophone records.P.Z.7572/33.

Sir, I iaave tiie iaonour to enclose a copy of a letter dated tjae '/th December 1933 from tiie CMef Local Representative^ Tiie Bahrain Petroleum Gompany Liiaited,containing a proposal by the Company to take up two pieces of land on Sitrah Island, and of the plan attached to it. 2. A copy is enclosed of Major Holmes* letters dated the A '.: b •; ■ t t !»I 21st March 1932 and the 13th June 1932 and of the Political Agent's reply dated the 16th June 1932 to which reference has ^ been made by the Chief Local Representative. In this corres pondence the Chief Local Representative,firstly,applied for permission to select an area or areas of the uncultivated lands belonging to the Bahrain Government within certain areas described by him; and, secondly, said that the Company were desirous of locating the Bahrain Government land inside those areas and asked for help to that end. The Chief Local Representative stated (paragraph 3 of his letter dated the 13th June 1932) that the selection of the above areas was to be made:- 'in accordance with the terms laid down in the Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1925 - upon which to erect the necessary plant and additional e^uigment,for the development of the oil resources te concession terrain' 1 . / ThePolitical Agent replied (a) tiiat If the Baixrain Petroleum Company Limited desxred to ascertain wiucii were and wMcix were not Government lands in a given, area and to survey them this could be arranged in conjunction with the Bahrain Government,and (h) that it was understood that the area selected would not be finally taken up until the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited entered upon the Mining Lease. Nothing further took place,except that the Company ascertainea irom the Adviser to the Bahrain Government that the Land Department of the Bahrain Government would lend a surveyor, siiould the Company wish to survey Sitrah and the main coast. 3. I cannot tina anything in the Concession Agreement of the 2nd December ISiib to justify the proposal to reserve land put torward by Major Holmes before the Company had taken up the Mining Lease. 4. In his letter dated the Vth December 1933 the Chief Local Representative now asics lor two things (i) the acquisition of two pieces of land on Sitrah Island,and (ii) the reservation of the areas referred to in Major Holmes 1 letter dated the 21st March 1932. b# The claim for the reservation of the areas asked for by Major Holmes (as stated above) does not appear to be admissible* Nor does it appear to be any more admissible today, and I would recommend that the Company should be informed that such reservations cannot,save by a new Agreement,be claimed unless and until the Company has entered on the Mining Lease# 6* In his proposal lor the acquisition of land on Sitrah Island,the Chief Local Representative assumes a right to acquire land,which the Company do not seem in fact to possess before they take up the Mining Lease. He,on this occasion,however, seeks to justify his proposal by claiming that the shipment of / oil3. u U\ J H/t 1 ^*2 ; ' 5 m.... « S5j^ s o3 1&amp; I )» )' y ■I ... .. . ..':. 3i'L m.\ i^ocu ^ (i) 3L iJ (ii) C: 3iII- rig??

Tne ^ om Pany appear to wish to nave the advantage both of an extension of the Prospecting License and of the Mining Lease,but I venture to tnink tnat this matter of the acquisition of land,wdich is essential to their project of shipping oil in large quantities by the 1st July 1934 (nineteen thirty-tour) attords a suitable opportunity for obtaining tbe desiderata mentioned in the »Pinal Minutes of Meeting Held at India Office on Wednesday,mh September, to consider amendments to be suggested to Bahrain Petroleum Company in Mining Lease' (Paper P.Z.6211/33). 0. At tne same time,it is to the financial interest of the Bahrain Government that the Company should come into neavy production as soon as possible,and I dope,therefore,tdat it will prove possible to ensure acceptance by the Company of our desiderata witnout undue oelay. It would,moreover,be unfortunate it tne Company were to find tdemselves in a position to make His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifad think tnat any delay in his receiving neavy royalties was to be attributed to their negotiations witn us. ^* I ^ is xijcely to caice some time to come to a decision on tins matter and I would,therefore,suggest tnat,in order to avoid any accusation ot delaying matters or of discourtesy in not replying, I should reply at once in tne terms of tne attacned draft. ^ x 10. I venture to reter to tne fourth to the seventd para graphs of my letter No:C/l08 dated the 11th March 1933 and to suggest tnat tne question of arranging for tde payment of tne royalties on a Sterling basis snould be considered. The advocates 01 t he policy ot a low rupee are renewing tdeir efforts,and any \ w ■IfM VI : /C, 1 ^laiiLieut-Colonel.

The Company^ Mining Lease (if they taKe it up) is lor a period ot fifty-five years,so that great sums may be at staice. I cannot oiler a useful opinion on the exchange question,but feel that it is incumbent upon us to obtain for His Excellency Shaiidi Hamad expert advice in the matter now that an opportunity Jaas presented itself oi modifying the terms ol his Agreement.

The Bahrain petroleum Company are raaktn^ two de^anas (paragraph 4 of the Political Agent*» letter)i {1} The acquisition of certain land in SITHAH Island, detailed in paragraph 7 of the Chief Local Eepresentatire*8 letter of tne 7th December 1933. (H) Tne reserration of certain other land elsewnere, as detailed in Major Holiaes* letter of ^ist March 1932» and referred to in paragraph 9 of the Chief Local HepresentatiTe f s letter* '-j- Us-'Jt 3. The reasons for the Cosapany^ demands would seam to/ Majesty *8 Secretary of State for India, India Office, LO&amp;DQIT • i 1to b® obTious enougii. T^y wish to start tne ^1® of oil umior tno Mining teas# a» soon as possiblo in ora.r tMt Uioy ffisy got an oarly return for tno aonoy tnoy Aiav# laid out iii initial oxpendituro, but are as yet uncertain of the exact areas wMcJa tney wish to include in their Mining Leases otherwise presumably they would not have ' 11 prospecting Licence to January 1954, Th^y apparently consider that py July 1934 they will nave got this inforiaation since they propose exporting oil on that date, (Tide this Hesidency printed letter jfo* 1697-8? dated the 12th Deceiaoer 1955)» though Mr. skinner in his letter oi DeceaDer ?th» paragraph 7* only says 'before the end of 1954«. Tney wish, if possible, to get all arrangements made so tnat they will be in a position to start exporting immediately the;? have taxen out tne Mining Lease, but the acquisition of the land in question and the construction of buildings and of the sub~marine line is included in tne preparations which tney must make before they can export. If they can acquire this land under the terms of the prospecting Licence, tney will oe able to buijtt on it at leisure and nave erezything reaoy to export immediately the&gt; taxe out the Mining Lease. If they can not acquire this lana under tne terms of tne prospecting Licence , thqi they will have to wait to ao so until they have actually taken out their Mining Lease. this will mean delay to them before tney can export the oil for sale. 4. under Article 1 of tne Third scnedule. Mining Lease, of tne tne ahaiich agrees to grant the Company the right to 'construct, e£eet, and operate, pipei lines, refineries, eto., etc» f M but as Colonel Loch points out there is notning in the Agreement which gives the Company/2 «• w o iL 7C Coapa^ this right, either to acquire or to reBorrt aueh land before the Mining Lease is taken out. Mr. skinners argument (Tide paragraph 7 of his letter) that »tne installation of the necessary facilities eoaes under the head of prospecting^ seems to me to t* &lt;4uite untenable. Tiae coarpany are in tne habit, however, of producing untenable arguments to support tneir claims, (e.g. in the matter of Major Hclme8 , resiaenoe at jiianrain vide para- f w r, (!:Ju 3 graph 3 of ^ demi-official letter mo . 247-y, aated the 21st March 193^, to Mr Parkinson, l J ue Qolonial office., /l' 'Uf ^tneir claim to tne extension of tne prospecting Licence, K \vide my despatch Mo. of the i7th April XdbS to iiis Majesty's Secretary of &amp;tfct«* f or tne Uolonies), ana l am not surprised at their producing yet another in support of their present demanas. 5* The Company propose exporting oil in next July (paragraph 5 above) but under Section 9 of the second Schedule, prospecting Licence, (and the company will still be operating under tne prospecting Licence in July next), as amended iA the Agreement of tne Ibth February 1953, they will nave te pay—it seems to *e—a royalty of Ha. 3-8-0 per ton. it would appear tnerefure tnat on the proposed export of 714 tons per diem they will have to pay royalty of Es» 2499 per diem. Mr $Kinner ss^ys nothing in his letter, nowever, about such payment. 6. if the company do not intend paying this royalty, and cannot evade payment fiy prouucing valid arguments, tnen tney might possibly evade payment lay taking out a Mining Lease in July or bctor^ tsijuce uuiaer this Lease they need not pay anything more tnen tne J*-, ! ' present ^c^-rate of &amp;&amp;• 10,000/- (recently raiaea to Rs. 30,000/-) per annum for a period of five years, wnile the/ &lt; i-4- 9./ the 'cormserclally exploitable quantities' not yet b( . en defined. Should evade Payment In this way, however, they will still meet with the difficulties discussed in paragraph 3 abere. So much for the Company's On our side the Shaikh's Interests coincide with those of the Coraoany In as ^ar as the latter wish to hegln the sale of oil as soon as possible, since until such sale does take olace he cannot (exeept In the clreurastances detailed In paragraph 6) eotnmence to receive his royalties. Unfortunately for the Shaikh, however, 'coratierclally exploitable quantities' - as already noted - Is nowhere defined In the Agref-ment, and the Company would appear to adopt an Interpretation which Is far fre 'Vi*t n * faV0Ura&gt;!le t0 the SlialWi (vide my telegram No. f/lOA,da^ed the 15th November 1633). Our general objective a+ this s+age therefore would anpear to be to Induce the Company to take out a Mining Lease as quickly as they can with 'commercially exploitable quantities' defined as far as possible In favour of +he Shaikh. ^ -avlng regard to all the circumstances, I venture to sugpest that - if my presumptions are eorreet - Mr. Ballantyne might be Informed: (a) 'hat the Company have no right to the grant of their requests mentioned In paragraph 2 above. (b) ' p hat If their requests are granted as a favour 1 1 the Company will have to pay Rs. 3/R/-&gt; per ton on oil exported, ■hen we see what the Company's reaction to this Is, we can consider our next step.,!j,. -5- ^ should li^e to ref®r 'briefly to the urgency which the CoBnsany almost invariably attach to a reply to their requests . ^he act that they are in a hurry, or say they are, does no really affect us — unless naturally it suits us and the Bhaildi to be in a hurry also, nie problems raised by the Company are often serious and con ^licated and ^e can only solve them to the best advantage of the Shaikh and of ourselves by careful consideration, and by refusing to be hustled, 10, With reference to Colonel Loch f s proposed reply to Mr. Skinner.

I have the honour to enclose a copy of the marginally noted correspondence regarding a request of The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited for the exemption of the personnel of the Tank Ship 'El Segundo' from the regulations which require a visa for persons coming to Bahrain. 2» The Chief Local Representative informed me that the Tank Ship is to remain at Bahrain for two or three months and that the personnel are to be employed in installing the sub marine line. 3. If the Tank Ship were coming to Bahrain in the course of her ordinary voyages for the purpose of shipping oil her crew would be covered by the ordinary custom governing the landing of members of a Ship f s Company from merchant ships. 4. In the present case the ship seems merely to be floating quarters for personnel of The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. /5. \ C-,1 if ! .j'' : ir ) s I ) 2. 5* Much diiiiculty is alr6ady experiencGd in enforcing the regulations regarding the possession of visas,both in the case of foreigners and of British subjects,and I think that it is uiidesiraoie to make any exception,especially one which might well develop into a method of avoiding the regulations altogether. 6. As the Tank Ship is likely to sail in the near future,I have replied to the Chief Local Representative as in my letter of which a copy is enclosed* If,however,you feel that some concession is desirable,I should be prepared, on behalf of the Bahrain G-overnment, to accept visas on the seamen 1 s certificates* This would save the Company the expense of passports and yet would keep our control intact. 7.

Ivlr. m ilantyne came to see me this mom lug with re fere 1196 to Inaia Office letter of 25rd November, P.Z.7iL67/35, about the interpretation of Clause V of the nix bt Scu ea die to the Bah re in Oil Concession of 2nci December 1925. v ^ He said tliat he had considered that letter in the light of the full correspondence between the Chief Local representative ana the local authorities of wnich he had now received copies from Bahrein. He had also had some informal discussion with Major Holmes as to what exactly had been inuended at trie Giiiiw wnen tnu concession nad Deen negotiated. IvHjor Holmes had strongly reaffirmed tne interpretation which he had already placed upon the relevant clause in his correspondence with tne Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government and the Company thought that there was something to be said for this interpretation ana that the Chief Local Representative had adopted a not unreasonable line. He added that his general feeling was that the matter was one of relatively small importance with which it should not have been necessary to trouble H.M.G., and secondly that it was desirable to reach some friendly settlement of it. It might well be that this could more easily be done on the spot. 3. 1 said that we had taken pains before raising the matter with the Company to assure ourselves that there was nothing on record to show the intentions of the two parties at the time when the concession was entered into and that the clause must therefore be interpreted as it stood. In our view,' however, while there might have been some genuine d sund e r stand ing/ 'ixn t/ rmsunaerstanalng on both sides, the position was quite clear. The terras 'material, apparatus and machinery' were intends a to cover te clinical equipment required. t)y the Company for trie purposes oi its field work; the term 'office requirements' was intended to cover secretarial materia..!, such as t^pev/riters, ofiice tables and desks. etc., required for the equipping of their secretarial on ices; the phrase 'not incluaing the personal requirements of employees' was intended to make it clear that personal equipment for employees, such as beds, mirrors and housenolci furniture generally, would be liable to pay such duty as was in force from time to time and was specifically excluded from the exemption granted to 'office requirements' and 'material, apparatus and machinery'. If a difference of opinion on the matter persisted, it woula, of course, be open to the Sheikh to take the matter to arbitration; but as the point was relatively such a small one, it seemed preferable to avoid this if possible» 4. Mr. Ballantyne saia that he agreed as to the uesirability of settling a relatively small point in a friendly way. It was a great pity that it had ever been necessary to raise it. Tne Company's attitude in the natter was, of course, that it had been intended at the time when this concession was entered into to secure exemption from customs duties for all the material necessary for the work carried out by the Company, and while this might not include phonographs he thought it was reasonable to contend that it covered furniture imported by the Company at i us own co st uo equip tne huts, etc. which it put up for the Company in Bahrein. He suggested, however, that the best method of dealing with the question would be that, 11 San Francisco agree a, it should be further discussed on the spot between mx . Sk inner, ■Colonel/1':* f|P \ * Colonel Loch and Mr, BeIgrave, with a view to a friendly unaerstanaing being reached as to the precise inuerpretation to De placed in practice on this phrase in the Second ana .third Scheaules of the Concession of 1935* The^hest thing would probably be an understanding embodying an agreement as to the articles which the Company could be allowed to import free of duty. In reply to a Question he added that there was no Question that a motorcar imported by an employee for his private us^- - as distinct from one imported by the Company for trie official purposes of its work, would, of course, be liable to duty. 5. I said we had no objection to further discussions in Bahrein, but we would, of course, make it clear before such discussions to the Bahrein Government that in our view their legal position in this matter was as set out in paragraph 3 above ana that they should take their stand in any discussions on that interpretation of the terms of the concession. Mr. Ballantyne said he would consult San Francisco by mail ana communicate further with me before any instructions were sent to Bahrein. 6.

I referred to Mr. Skinners demi- 1 ^ n , official letter of 18th November 1933 to trie Political Agent, Bahrein, of which copies were received by us under ./p ^ the Political Resident's express letter No.C. 172 of 1^3. Mr. Ballantyne said he had had no previous intimation that a request of this nature had been made by Mr. Skinner, and would make enquiry of him regarding it. I said tnat c far as we were concerned we had consulted the Admiralty, wr-o were not yet in a position to tell us to what ex ten o 'Uiey could/f* ^ could assist, -out who, I gathered, thought it possible that they might be able to produce an advance copy of a cnart vvmch woula be of service to the Company. If so, its probable cost would be m the neighbourhood of £10. As regards tne actual buoying of channels, etc. it might well oe that tne simplest course would be that when the captain of it .M.S. 'Ormonde', which was, I understood, again in the Persian Gun, next called at Bahrein, he, the Political I Agent ana fcr. Skinner should discuss the matter with a view to clearing the air. 1 m Appointment 01 a permanent Chief L ocr I . Repiesentative, I saicl that the Sheikh had now on two- occasions raised the question of Mr, skinner's position and had enquired for how long he was to act and what the intentions of the Company in the matter were. We had not soj far sent him a reply to his letters. Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company had noticed in correspondence of which copies had been sent hy Mr. skinner that a, request of this nature had 'been made hy the sheikh, the Company would no doubt put forward proposals in due course for our consideration. He had, however, mentioned privately and unofficially to me at an earlier stage the possibility that they might desire to suggest the name of iv-i • jeIgrctve as aj. • inner' s successor. Speaking equally privately ana unofficially I thought it well to give him a warning that difficulty might arise over this. We had the highest opinion of Mr. Belgrave, who had done excellent work in Bahrein. But there seemed obvious objections to his doubling the post of Chief Local Representative and Financial Adviser to tne Bahrein Government. I need not amplify these. Mr. Ballantyne said that he entirely agreed that it would be impossible for Mr. Belgrave, were the Company to wish to suggest him as Chief Local Se pre sent ative 9 to/ _ a--to continue to serve as financial Aavlser, Bahrein, end ohiat ne j-uily appreciated the objections to the doubling of the posts, as, he felt sure, would the Company also. He wlshea, nowever, to make ciear that the hint which he had given me ao &amp;n bailier stage aiu not correspond to any iixcu iiiuGiition on 1210 part or trie Gorripany. But a suggestion had been put forward - he did not say by whom /? fejor Holme s7 - that Mr. Belgrave should be appointed to on is post, and ne (ivir. Lallan tyne) and the Company, who had not been aware how complete our information in the matter was, iiad d e0n anxious to emphasise that this was a matter wiiich must oe considered entirely separately from the exoensicn 01 the pro specting licence. He would , however, now communicate with the Company again and press them for an early intimation of their wishes in regard to the a pp 0 in tme n t of a pe rman e n t Ch i e f ijocal He pre se nt at ive. 4th December 1933» j $ \j, Litt IIH jJA IT ji •( (liA^ityr $ V jfU, ^ Ph u^jUclci) £0N?IDSNTI4L. nH ^ J, ^ 5 INDIa OP^IOv . /' | j ^ P.Z.7929/35. 1 ' / ^1^ \ Jr NOTE QF IKIKHVEW WITH M8.

Mr. Skinner had, however, intimated that the matter had been taken up with the yh, E 5 Political Agent on the 18th November and was, he assumed, now under reference to the India Office, as no reply had yet been received. I read Baiiantyne Mr. Skinner's letter of the 18th November to Colonel Loch (P.Z.7760/33) and repeated what I had said at our meeting of 4th December, viz. that the Admiralty were not yet in a position to tell us to what extent they could assist, but that it was possible that they might be able to produce an advance copy of a chart which would be of service, the probable cost of which would be in the neighbourhood of £10; that as regards the actual buoying of channels I was myself disposed to think that the simplest course would be that the matter should be discussed on the ORMDNDE's next visit to Bahrein between the political Agent, Mr. Skinner, and the Captain of the ORMDNDE. I could not, of course, give any indication/» jlV) -&gt;7 : ' v —/ o indication of what ths cost to the Company of the. work which they required done would he likely to he, Mr.Ballantyne said he woula inform Mr.Skinner oy letter of the present position in regard to the request he had put forv/ard. 5- Employgfent oy Corup any 01 r aa io- 1a 1 etjiio ne transiiiitters » (please see on this the telegram from the political Agent, Bahrein to the political Resident, repeated to the Secretary '.j of State, No.566, of 6th December, which explains what the Company had in view and the Sheikh's reaction to their request). Mr. Ballantyne said that from a telegram from Mr.Skinner he understood that the conditions on which the installation of these transmitters could be permitted had been aiscussed locally, that tne Sheikh was prepared to agi^ subject to certain safeguards for existing wireless installations, end that tne question had been referred ./ ■&gt; / r-- urgently to the India Office. As the telegram of 6th December stated that the Sheikh 1 s views had already been communicated to Mr.skinner I gave its substance to Mr.Ballantyne, and explained in the first place, in reply to _ u i 1 |i l __ ll|rii a —^ an enquiry by him, that the Imperial and International Communications Company had a separate wireless estaolishment from Imperial Airways, and that it would he necessary to avoid interference with either; secondly that the Sheikh had stipulated that if wireless telephones were allowed at this stage to trie Company they should not be Lised for transmission to stations outside Bahrein. Mr.Ballantyne said that as he understood the position trie Company, who appeared, so far as he could Judge, (though he was not to oe taken as making any statement as to their intentions and hoped tnau iui. ok inner had equally taken care to avoid committing himself in any way regarding them) to be pressing on with plan^ lor marketing oil, were anxious to instal these telephones i-or purposes of communication between shore and vessel in connection firstly with the charting of channels referred to in paragraph 2 above, and secondly with the arrangements for the loading ana shipping of oil. He was not quite3. biire, however, that tney might not wish to use the telcpiioncb, when installed, lor transmissions to otauions or ships outside the territory of Bahrein. I said it appeared important to clear up this point, as our view would, I thought, oe quite definitely that for ctny purposes other than for office and local purposes wiuhin Bahrein connected with tne production etc. of oil, the Company should use the ordinary facilities provided uy the Communleations Company. Mr. Ballantyne said he appreciated tne point and would mention it to San Francisco. 4 - He enquired as to the best method of dealing witn the question of avoiding interference with the wireless installations of Airways and the Communications Company. I said that I thought we should be willing to write to both Companies explaining the position to them and asking them to assist the Bahrein Petroleum Company in the matter. Mr. Ballantyne expressed appreciation* 7th December 1933. &lt;J • Gr • LAI Til v'vA 1R. Air Mail . - w 2q w ' m c. A- e?
