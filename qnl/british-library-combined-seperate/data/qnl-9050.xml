The case concerns a joint venture between the aforementioned parties to set up and operate an ice-making plant in Bahrain at a spring owned by Mr. Khunji in 1922. Following the expiration of a five year monopoly on the manufacture and sale of ice in Bahrain, the two parties fell into a dispute on the plant.The majority of the papers consist of legal correspondence between Mr Khunji's lawyers in Manchester and either the Political Agent in Bahrain or the Financial Advisor to the Ruler of Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave. Of note, however, are letters of intervention by the Foreign Minister of Iran through the Persian Legation in London, protesting the treatment of a Persian subject in British protected territory.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Legal disputes</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Bahrain Ḥamad bin 'Īsá Āl Khalīfah</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Ice making</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00013a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00013a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
