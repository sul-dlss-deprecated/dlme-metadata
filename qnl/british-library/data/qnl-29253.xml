(v) Air Services . Mr, F. Bosworth was given permission to run pleasure flights during the Id holidays. He has also been given permission for non-schedule flights to Sharjah from Bahrain pending a decision on the question of his running schedule flights to Sharjah. (vi) Pe arl marke t, Mr. Lieberman, a United States pearl merchant, whose own company is associated with the United States firms of Jacques Bienfeld Incorporated and the Sea Gems Company and.connected with dealers in the United Kingdom and France visited Bahrain to study the pearl market. He said that Bahrain merchants would not sort the kind of pearls he re quired for sale in Europe and the United States so that he was obliged to buy packets of which he could only use about 10$. The remainder would have to be re-imported to Bahrain or exported to India. He estimated that in Bahrain and Dubai there were large accumulations of good pearls awaiting a market. He said that there was a demand for pearls in the United Kingdom and France, that was second only to that for diamonds, as an insurance against depreciating currency and that for the first time in history pearls were cheaper in the United States than in Europe and European buyers had crossed the Atlantic in search of them. Mr. Lieberman claimed that sales of cultured pearls encouraged the demand for real pearls. He said that as a result of publicity De Beers had improved their diamond* sales and he felt sure that the real pearl market would respond to publicity. American, British and French merchants would be prepared to contribute. . He said that a proposal to this effect had been made to the Bahrain Government, without result, two or three years ago. He intended to re-examine the market in Europe resulting from revalued currencies in the light of the knowledge he had acquired of the local market in Bahrain and to return here next season. (vii) B ritish Police De tachment . The Bahrain Government have engaged a fourth man from the former Palestine Police and all four are expected to arrive in Bahrain shortly (viii) Malar ia Contro l. The Bahrain Petroleum Company are carrying out measures to control malaria in twenty-six villages on the island using a solution of D.D.T. per gallon applied and requiring one gallon of liquid per acre water surface. The solution is sprayed in a very fine mist and no damage to gardens should result.4 3 152 c QATi-JR o (i) Si tuat io n in Qatrr 0 Shaikh Abdulla who abdicated remains in the pe ninsula and the Darwish family have extended the influence they exercise over him to his son the present ruler Shaikh Ali. (ii) Id Calls . Calls on the first day of the 'Id were paid to Shaikh Abdulla. Among the callers was the Ruler Shaikh Ali„ Shaikh Ali received on the second day. The Political Officer called first (as soon as he was available) on Shaikh Ali and afterwards on Shaikh Abdulla. On the last day' of the 'Id Shaikh Sa'ud of Wakra paid a call on Shaikh Ali as part of a plan of reconciliation but with little apparent result, (iii) There are elements in Qatar that look forward to a new deal in the peninsula but Shaikh Ali is no F.D.R, Kis object seems to be to scrape along until the royalties begin to pour in and then to live for himself alone. No administration is being set up, no progress is being made with the budget, the whole country stagnates and the forces of reaction dig themselves in deeper every day. The need for appointing an Adviser grows daily more imperative. (iv) Inspector Cochrane (who at least has got his pay) expects to increase the strength of the police with the end of the pearling season. He hopes also to increase their present low wages. He paid a short visit to Bahrain to buy materials for the Police and stated that Shaikh r.li's second and favourite son Ahmad who is nominally in charge of the police is intelligent, helpful and promising. 153.

(iv) Reference paragraph 134 of Summary No.16 Shaikh Humaid bin Saqr, .brother of the Ruler of Sharjah, left for Sharjah by launch on the 29th. 146. QA TAR . (i) Zubarah . As a result of the call at the Foreign Office by Mr. Bel grave, the Adviser, and Mr. Ballantyne, the Sha J, vh considers that not every dot and comma in his voluminous correspondence with the Agency on the subject of Zubarah has been faithfully transmitted to London and so he is in clined to feel that his interests have been neglected. He also thinks that the change of Ruler in Qatar is a golden op portunity for settling this ageing dispute. It might be but for the fact that Shaikh Abdulla although abdicated srnll stays on in Qatar and is still visited daily by his son the new Ruler and even spoke recently of paying a visit to Zubarah himself. The attitude of the Shaikh of Bahrain is now very ' reasonable and as a bait towards settlement he has offered to substitute transit dues on goods for Qatar passing through Bahrain instead of the full dues now levied. The Shaikh is now asking for an assurance from His Majesty’s Government, not Qatar, that his rights in Zubarah will be respected.3 (ii) Gray Macke nzie; ^® ssrs ° ? Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd.

( 1v ) British B ank of Iran and the Middl e East . The bank has received permission to visit Qatar with a view to studying local banking possibilities. (v) Pol itical Agency in Doha . The Ruler has offered to provide a piece of land for the new Agency building in Doha and the various alterna tive sites are under examination. (vi) Inter nal Orga nisation . The progress of the Ruler towards becoming an enlightened monarch is extremely slow. His personal expen diture is on a fairly generous scale but he shows little en thusiasm for promotin T the extremely feeble growth of his new police force.and none at all for organising his State. He is unable and unwilling to distinguish between personal and State income. And when asked to draw up a tentative budget ended by declining to consider the matter. In this he was doubtless prompted by his father who is showing signs of surprising rejuvenation and whose idea of State finance is that all receipts should go direct to the privy purse and stay there. In order to ease the monetary demands of the Shaikh’s relations it is proposed to find them, where pos sible, suitable employment in government service. This project however has made little headway. It has been es timated that two-thirds to three-quarters of the Customs dues collected find their way at the pocket of the Director of Customs, A proposal that motor vehicles should be li censed by the police was accepted by the Shaikh but the re- ^ultafttincome is likely to go in the Shaikh’s pocket rather than in helping to pay for the police force as was intended. The delay in appointing an Adviser is to some extent responsible for the failure to make headway in Qatar. But a much greater obstacle is Shaikh All’s outlook in which he is encouraged by his father, by local influences such as the v Darwish family and thx by the example of Saudi Arabia. If oil royalties in Qatar are not to be frittered away but ap plied to the public good a very firm line will.sooner or later have to be taken with Shaikh Ali. The appointment of an Adviser remains the first essential step. Meanwhile there are hopes of c. reconciliation between Shaikh Sa'ud bin Abdur Rahman 'of Wakra and the Ruler whoo 4 who is reported to be ready to accept the Shaikh as Emir of Wakrah. Shaikh Sa'ud seems to be a strong character and to have him in authority in the neighbourhood of the new tanker port of Umm Said might have many advantages. 146, TRUC IAL COAST . (i) Hoyements of Shaik hs. On the 17th Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashic^Ruler of Umm al Qaiwain, arrived at Sharjah. He visited the Medical Officer for medical attention and returned to Umm al Qaiwain the same day. U . Shaikh Sai'd bin Makturn, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, returned to Dubai from Ras al Khaimah during the period under review. » (ii) Local Affairs . On the 16th Jasim bin Daiam, a notable and wealthy merchant of Jazzirat az-Za'ab, was killed at al-Hail (16 miles south of Ras al Khaimah) by three of Ayal bin Qazib, subjects of the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah. The murderers fled and took refuge with Saif bin *li bin Saif, Chief of the al-Khawatir tribe. Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, sent out a party of armed men to trace the cul prits but failed to arrest them. The Ruler of Ras al Khaimah asked Saif bin Ali to hand over the murderers for punishment and offered him Rs,10,000 f Ikramiyah’ to release them; but following tribal custom he refused. It appears that the said killed man is the uncle of Abdullah bin Hassan, Shaikh of Jazzirat az-Za’ab. The assasination arose from domestic troubles. On the 23rd a gang of the al-Awamir robbers' attacked a caravan of Dubai near thee.Jabo^aEayah pass on its way’ from Dubai to Batinah. They looted four camels and then ran away into the desert. The Shaikh of Dubai sent out a party of 10 armed men on camels to pursue them. On the 25th Shaikh of Dubai arrested six men who were reported to be selling ’Araq* and had in their possession three barrels and other distilling equipment. They were lashed, their faces were coloured with tar and were driven through market and public places. After fourdays imprison ment they were released. (iii) Tan b Island . The Captain of L.T, M Nearchus n was informed by the lighthouse staff at Tanb Island that according to the local villagers the Persians have placed a flagstaff on Nabiyu Tanb.

Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa A1 Khalifah, un le of His Highness, left for the Haj with 80 persons in two planes specially sent for this purpose by Ibn Saud on the 12th. Shaikh Abdullah’s four grandsons left for Ca:'^o on the 12th for studies. 136. QA TAR . Shaikh Ali obtained 4 lacs of rupees from Petroleum Concessions Limited as an advance on royalties and promptly spent it in cars, old debts, gifts to relatives and so on so that when the Political Resident broached the question of the future organisation of the peninsula he pleaded poverty and asked that the matter should be shelved for six months. The ^ export of oil is due to start in early December so tiiau it is essential that some local organisation should be set up before then. The Shaikh has now moved into and furni^ed palace in Doha and although apparently he still visits his father daily in Riyan at least he is now living in a separate place and establishment. He entertained the Politjeal Resident to lunch on the occasion of His Excellency’s official visit. ^ But what was significant from the point of view of his gaining confidencj and courage is that he gave lunch to the Manager of Gray Mackenzie on a one-day visit a week later. Palace standards are reported to be improving noticeably.

These allow fc** British trade-in Qatar, the appointment of a Political : i ,u i-. r f Officer3 Officer and the establishment of a postal and telegraph agency, , t On August 20th letters were exchanged with Shaikh Abdullah whereby he abdicated in favour of his son Shaikh Ali and was formally released from his obligations which Shaikh Ali took over. In return His Majesty’s Government formally recognized Shaikh Ali as Ruler of Qatar. Shaikh Ali made a written request for the appointment of an Adviser. The exchange of these letters took place in the morning of August 20th and the news was announced by the Acting Political Resident to the Shaikh's assembled family of over 50 relatives before noon. In the afternoon a public declaration of the abdication and accession took place in the open space in front of the palace at Doha. H.M.S. 'Flamingo' (Lt. Commander D.J. Godden, R.N.) pro vided a guard of honour and a bugler and the ship's guns fired a salute. This was stated to be the first public ceremony to take place at Qatar.

The retiring Shaikh is over 80 years of age, Shaikh Ali is about 56 and unused to exercising authority. The new Shaikh's first act was to write a friendly letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain. His second was to ask Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. for money. He has been given an advance of royalties. The Shaikh of Bahrain sees in the change a chance of regaining his properties at Zubarah in Qatar which have been the subject of a quarrel between him and Shaikh Abdullah since 1936. The Shaikh of Bahrain's reply to Shaikh All's letter was thus very cordial. The Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. report that Shaikh Ali paid a visit to the oil company's installation at Dukhan on the 27th.

On the 8th, Shaikh Isa bin Salman, the eldest son of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, was married to the daughter of Shaikh Salman bin Ibrahim A1 Khalifah. His Highness gave a number of 'wedding breakfasts', and entertained His Excellency the Political Resident, Mr.B.A.B.Burrows, the Political Agent, and about 30 other members of the local European community to dinner on the 12th. * On the 6th Shaikh All, the eldest,son of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifa and a cousin of His Highness overtook and stopped his car in front of the car of Father Anselm, the , Roman Catholic Chaplain of Manama (an Indian subject) and struck Father Anselm when he got out of his car to ask the reason. Shaikh Ali who was the worse for liquor appears to have been picqued by the fact that a policeman on duty at a traffic junction gave Father Anselm's car the right of way rather than that of Shaikh Ali which was at a greater distance from the-2 policeman. As a result of the Political Agent’s writing to His Highness, Shaikh Ali was summoned before his father, Shaikh Abdullah, and Mr.C.D. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, sitting as Judges of the Bahrain Court, and sentenced to confinement to the island of Muharraq and the nayment of a fine of Rs.4,000/-.

His Excellency the Political Resident, His Highness Shaikh Salman, and most of the Bahrain Government officials ^ng , present. Old boys art critical of the fact that most of the ’•athletic” events have given place over the years to ceremonial marches, drill displays, football on stilts, and musical ohairs, but the younger generation of school boys seems to su items immensely. Spectators who were a little bored at seeing all thirty members of a troupe performing in turn the most ordinary feats on the vaulting horse were compensated with a raffle on the programme numbers, the lucky winner his money prize from the hand of the infant son of His Highness. On the 12th the Police Sports were held in the grounds of the Manama Police Fort. k long programme included sprints, a relay race, pole vaulting and a display of tent pegging! It was marred for early arrivals by the ?P ec J abl ° number of shackled prisoners putting the finishing touches to the sports ground, while officials bustled, prominent guests were led to their seats, and the Commandant of the State Police puffed contentedly at his cigar. (iv) Nehi Saleh Tragedy :- Jezirah or Nebi Saleh, a small island of the West Coast of Manama Island, contains the tomb of, Nebi Sa J;® h ’ L„ inls local Shiah Saint, and forms a place of for Bahrainis of the Shiah sect.

V man, a driver, was on duty for the evening, and he could not be found whensthe fire started.

The taxi driver, who was tried by the Bahrain Court for drinking the beer, received a sentence of eight months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of one thousand rupees. On the 7th April Abdullah Bangoor, J^aqi caretaker of the Royal Naval Establishment at Jufair, who is^iquor permit holder.spent a convivial evening with three prostitutes and some of his friends. On the 8th May the only Bahraini present, a clerk in the office of the Judicial Assistant to the Political Agent, was sentenced to two months rigorous imprisonment by the Bahrain Court. No proper evidence that he was intoxicated or that he had consumed liquor was produced in court, sentence being pro nounced, according to the latest issue of the Bahrain Government Gazette, 'as an example to public morality'.

This punishment had unpleasant repercussions as the Bidah and part of Shihuh have risen, against the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and held some positions in the Shamil area. They were instigated and greatly assisted by the Shaikh of Rams who sent his nephew.to them with an offer to become their Amir. One of Dubai merchants named Hamad bin Majid bin Fitaim, effected a 5-day truce between both sides and Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, and his brother Jumah bin Maktum, who volunteered to mediate in this trouble, left for Ras al Khaimah.

On the 21st His Highness Shaikh Salman was presented with a 7-seater Cadillac Sedan Car by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. (ii) ftahrafrn Races . On the 22nd the Bahrain Spring Race Meeting was held. Substantially the attendance and runners were the same as on previous occasions. The proceeds of the meeting are being given to the Palestine Refugees Fund. il a 1(ill) Boxing Competition . On the night of the 28th, the Nadi-al-Bahrain staged a boxing competition in the Muharraq premises of the club. The first bout was between two small boys from the Muharraq primary school, and Indian, Pakistani and Bahraini boxers provided the contestants in the other six bouts. Care had been taken in the appointments and lighting of the ring, the contests were well conducted, and the programme was carried through with a smoothness and despatch that is the more creditable as it is the first time that a Bahraini club has staged a boxing competition. His Highness Shaikh Salman, His Excellency the Political Resident, Shaikh Abdulla bin Issa al Khalifah, and Mr. R.Mc.C. Andrew^ Assistant Political 'Agent, Bahrain, attended, and His Highness presented the medals given to the winners.

The annual handicrafts exhibition which was held this year on the 29th and 30th of April was on a more ambitious scale than in former years.

The only ice factory in Bahrain which sells ice to the general public is owned by Husain Yateem, a purchasing agent and local contractor of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The virtual monoply which Mr.Yateem enjoys is, however, soon to be broken as a new ice factory is being built for Abdur Rahman al Gosaibi, the machinery ^ for which recently arrived in Bahrain, and two other Bahrain merchants have ordered plants for ice factories. One of them, Hussain Ahme.i, is providing his ice factory with ample cold storage accommodation. The manufacture and sale of ice is a profitable industry in Bahrain though it has to be seen whether there is enough business for four ice factories. It has been estimated that Husain Yateem is receiving a net profit of around Rs.2,000/- a month for his ice factory. This figure has been calculated from the controlled price obtaining for ice and should be considerably larger in fact for Mr.Yateem is known to sell much of his daily output of ice on the black market. He is not unaware of what dangers lie in competition, and has prepared against them by importing another ice plant and by engaging an Italian Engineer as his refrigeration expert. (vi) Crim e.

On the 28th he acquitted the two accused because of insufficient evidence to prove the charge. There has been a great increase' recently in the bu_glarious entry at night of shops in the Manama bazaar, the burglars displaying a surprising initiative and seeming to enjoy great free'* 1 ^ ~f movement. They recently forced their way into' the business premises of a Jewish merchant by digging a hole through the roof. On the no. of the 28th they broke into the shop of a Hindu money changer and robbed him of a quantity of gold worth some Rs.17,000/-.

Wgr A (ii) Reference paragraph 46 of Intelligence S ummary No.9 . His Highness has issued an ’’Ahlan” forbidding Bahrainis from visiting Qatar without first obtaining written permission from the Bahrain Government. The ’’Ahlan” has come in for acrimonious comment from all classes of Bahrainis who call it absurd. The prohibition is enforced even where a Bahraini who is visiting Dubai or Sharjah travels by a vessel which touches at a Qatar port en route. * 73. PALESTINE ARAB REFUG EES . The Bahrain Government and local Oil Companies have been sounded regarding the possibility of settling and finding employment here for Arab refugees from Palestine. The Bahrain Government have replied that they are willing to employ a small number of refugees as agricultural labourers in the Budaiya Experimental Farm and, if they possessed the necessary qualifications, as.teachers in the Government schools They were, however, not disposed to meet the financial cost of bringing the refugees to Bahrain. The Bahrain Petroleum Company were only willing to employ skilled labour wuch as ex refinery hands.

Reference paragraph 255 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.19. On the 10th Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa returned from Kuwait. (ii) A round robin signed by a large number of the A1 Khalifah shaikhs and addressed to His Highness Shaikh Salman asking him for increases in allowances has led to a real family row. The Shaikh as usual when his pocket threatens to be affected beceme incensed, and condemned his relations, with indeed a good deal of truth, as vi cious and useless parasites - not that that really upsets him but he genuinely objects to unconcealed vice. He has not so far given any notice to the request for in creases but relations are very strained. The incident is symptomatic of the unfortunate social and economic consequences of the monetary inflation following the pouring of oil royalties into an area, the inhabitants of which do not know how to spend them. (iii) R ace Meeting . The Winter Race Meeting on the 10th was held in good weather and provided a card of six events. It was largely attended, among those present being His Excel lency the Political Resident and Lady Hay, His Highness Shaikh Salman, Sir Evan Jenkins, Mr. Bertram Thomas Mr. Littler, British Consul-General, Basrah, and Mrs. Littler, Mr. C.D. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and Mrs. Belgrave, the Political Agent, and the Assistant Political Agent and Mrs. Hudson.-3- (v5) The proceeds of the race meeting are being donated to the Red Crescent Society. The first race provided a popular victory for.’Leshgarr f ridden by the young son of the owner, Haji Mansour al Araydh, who had practised every evening for some weeks before the race. The third race, in which three horses contested first place in a very close finish, was won by Miss Hay on ’Twaisa’, owned by Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed bin Isa. The main event was won by His Highness' hor&amp;e 'Rabda* with another of his horses in second place. The silver cup for first place was auctioned after the meeting in aid of the Red Crescent and knocked down to Mr. Khalid Aujan, a ],ocal merchant, for Rs.2,000/-. (iv) Pump i ng Sta t ion . No.18. Reference paragraph 245 of Intelligence Summary On the 11th His Highness Shaikh Salman formally opened the new pumping station in Manamah erected by Messrs. Holloway Bros, to supply the town with piped drinking water. (v) Wells. The wells in most private houses in Manamah are very badly kept by their owners and are in a filthy and insanitary condition. The Bahrain Government have been contemplating the sealing up of many of these wells now that Manamah has a piped water supply, and a recent tragedy may force them to take immediate steps to this end. On the 12th a servant who descended one of those wells to recover an eating mat that had fallen into it was overcome by the gases he had disturbed in his descent and drwwned. A se cond servant who descended to search for the first suffered a similar fate. A third man who attempted to enter the well was also affected but was pulled up in time to save his life. The State Medical Officer was summoned and, after the two bodies had been recovered, he chlorinated the well and ordered*'that no person should go near it until it had been sealed up. (vi) Cinemas. Reference paragraph 215 v) of Intelligence Summary No.16. The 'Pearl Cinema' closed during Mohurram and only reopened on the 7th of this month. During the time it was closed a new projector and sound apparatus,which were ordered from the United Kingdom,have been irstalled and arrangements made for the showing of several new Egyptian films. With these improvements it is now draw ing full houses nightly. Yet another cinema is nearing completion in Manamah and will be opened shortly. It will be the fifth Arab cinema in Bahrain. B*. (vii) Banc o School . The Bahrain Petroleum Company have opened a school in which English and Arithmetic are taught to about.....-4- about 50 of the local employees. The school is well run although its object is not generally 'social uplift', but to make the employees more useful to the Company. 266. AUTOMA TIC TELEPHONES . Reference paragraph 228 of Intelligence Summary No.17. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government has written to the Manager of Messrs, Cable and Wireless and informed him that so long as the company insist on maintaining those clauses in the subscribers' agreement to which there has been objection neither His Highness nor the other Arab subscribers are prepared to sign the agreement. The main point at issue seems to be that of a high tariff with an unlimited number of calls to be allowed each subscriber versus a low tariff with a limited number of calls. The company maintain that a high tariff would mean fewer subscribers but His Highness and the other Arab subscribers do not agree with this view and want calls to be unlimited. 267. B RITISH COUNCIL . Some months ago, the British Council allocated a small sum of money for subventions for local educational organisations. After consulting the local educational authorities, the British Council were asked to provide sets of physiology and biology wall charts, travel association posterw, and photographs and charts of British agriculture, industry and commerce. These have recently been received here and have been distributed to the schools concerned. 268 . 'WATER CONSURVAT I ON. His Highness and the adviser to the Bahrain Government have often expressed their concern at the great wastage of water that tak-/..s place from the uneconomical sinking of wells and have in several instances made this the reason for holding up or refusing the sinking of new wells by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, alleging that this would result in the drying up of other wells in the vicinity. The Company have now pointed out that they were recently consulted by His Highness about the sinking of a new well in the property of one of the A1 Khalifah and that though they advised against it on the grounds that the property could be easily supplied with water from other wells in the area and that a new well would supply a quantity of water far in excess of that required for the property, His Highness insisted on the sinking of a new well. The Political Agent is addressing the Shaikh on the matter 269. QATiiR . Naim bin Wadiva. Reference paragraph 236 of Intelligence Summary No.17. Saleh jr.l Mani' , Secretary to His Excellency the Ruler of Qatar, (to whom the Political iigent spoke when..(v) .... -5- when he visited Qatar recently) has now found Naim bin Wadiya and sent him to Bahrain, The boy was kidnapped in Dubai and taken to Buraimi where he was bought by one Muhammad bin Salim, a Qatari, who rent him wirh his agent to Qatar for sale to the Amir of Dothan, When a search was made for the boy he was sent away by the Amir to the interior of Qatar from where he was eventually recovered by the efforts of Saleh nl Mani', The fact that the Political Agent took the boy’s father v/ith him to Qatar and presented him to Saleh al Mani' is probably responsibj.e for his son's rescue. 270. TRU CIAL COAST . (i) Petroleum,Dev elopme nt (Tr ucial Coast) Limited. On the 1st December the Company began a survey of the area south of Jabal Ali. The extent and direction of this survey will depend on the results achieved by the Company in the course of their survey operations. (ii) Dubai - Abu Dhabi di spute, Reference paragraph 220 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No.16. Evidence has been accumulating that Shaikh Rashid, son of the Ruler of Dubai, has been bribing the Buraimi tribes in order to win them away from their al legiance to Abu Dhabi. He is reported to be paying as much as Rs.300/- to a Chief who normally gets only Rs.TOA or Rs,30/- from the Ruler of Abu Dhabi whose limited re sources do not allow him to make large payments to the tribes. The latter has informed t^e Political Officer*, Trucial Coast, that Shaikh Rashid hu.s also sent spies and mischief makers to Buraimi in order to create dis sension between the Buraimi tribes and Abu Dhabi. He appeared, however, confident that Rashid would not succeed in his attempts and said that he was satisfied as to the loyalty of the Manasir, his chief adherents. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast is warning Shaikh Rashid to desist from his undesirable activities. (iii) Fu.i airah . Reference paragraph 260 (v) of Intelligence Summary No.19. Shaikh Muhammad bin Hamad ash-Sharqi of Fujairah and Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali, Paramount Chief of the Beni Qitab, recently met at the Jiri and professed friendship to each other in the presence of Shaikh Jumari bin Maktum. (iv) Sharjah . The Shaikh of Sharjah has increased security precautions in Sharjah by night. He was seen once- patrolling the town at night. He and his brother \ sleep in the Fort instead of in their usual houses. The Shaikh of Sharjah has not disclosed to anybody thf reasons that.led^him to take such measures but from discreet en quiries it is possible that he may be uneasy about his step brothers who have always been discortented with the some what parsimonious allowances he has been giving them.'(v) Ther^ is said to be ill feeling between the Shaikh of Sharjah on the one side and the Chief of the Beni Qitab, Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin and his nephew Ali bin Abdullah bin Huwaidin on the other over payments due to them on account of oil. Negotiations are going on between them to settle this matter. (vi) It is reported that the Shaikh of Sharjah feels.that Shaikh Rahmah bin Abdul Rahman of Hire is in triguing against him and accuses him of instigating be douins against him. Shaikh Rahmah is therefore unable to come to Sharjah as he fears that he may be arrested by the Shaikh of Sharjah. (vii) Nai* m. The Nai’m tribe under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan looted some camels from the Beni Qitab and the former retaliated by stealing five camels from the Nai 5 m. Ef forts are being made by Shaikh Rashid bin Said of Dubai to bring about a reconciliation. (viii) Rain. Towards the end of November, heavy rain fell on Abu Dhabi territory upto and including Buraimi. The rain lasted five days and formed a lake in a salty de pression some 20 miles south-west of Abu Dhabi. This lake is over 6 feet deep in parts and has already attracted numerous birds including duck and flamingo. (ix) Shooting Incident . On returning from Buraimi as mentioned in paragraph 263 above, the Political Agent and party were fired on and held up by Beni Qitab tribesmen. The Naim n Dalil n (guide) with them nearly made matters worse by shouting that he was from the Nai'm and tha.t they and the Beni Qitab were 'on the same road'. This remark was taken derisorily and it was not until Mr. Bird of the Petroleum Concessions Limited, had explained that the cars were oil company cars that the party was allowed to proceed. The excuse given by the Beni Qitab for the hold-up was that they expected Nai'm to be in the cars and were hostile to them as a result of the incident mentioned in paragraph 270 (vii) above. The Residency Agent unfortunately gave the Beni Qitab Rs.10/- on the party being permitted to proceed and this may encourage similar instances. 271. CORRI GEND UM. Reference paragraph 242 (iv&gt; of Intelligence Summary No.18. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim is not of the A1 Bu Shamis tribe but is a cousin of Shaikh Obaid bin Juma'h, Chief of the Beni Ka'ab. Hamad bin Said is not a Shaikh. Hamasah is the name of an A1 Bu Shamis' township but there is no 'Hamasah' section of the tribe. 272.

On the 21st Lord Kennett of Dene, Chairman of the Imperial Bank of Iran, and Mr. Payne, Chief Manager, Teheran, arrived in Bahrain and left on the 26th. They stayed at the Agency. 254. CALLS . (i) On the 16th the Assistant_Political Agent took Commander Best, R.N., the new Commanding Officer of h.M.S. ••Loch Quoich' , to call on His Highness at Ghadhabiyeh Palace- His Highness returned the call at the Agency the same day. (ii) On the 25th Mr. Emile Bustaneh of the Arab Contracting Company, Lebanon, called on the Political Agent. He proposes to build and run an hotel in Bahrain. 255. LOCAL AFFAIRS. (i) A1 Khalifah . On the 17th Shaikh Abdullah.bin Isa, uncle of His Highness, left for Kuwait on a hawking trip into the hinterland. He was accompanied by his nephews, Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammad, Superintent of Police, Bahrain, and. Shaikh Salman bin Muhammad, one of the judges of the Bahrain lower court. The latter returned to Bahrain on the 23rd. (ii) P earlin g. Reference paragraph 249 of Intelligence Summary No.18. There were 69 boats with a total complement of 2560 persons engaged in pearling operations this year. The total catch is estimated to be worth about Rupees four lakhs. This has disappointed those, like His Highness, who- 2 - who hoped for a revival of the Bahrain Pearling Industry. They may, however, find some consolation in the reflection that the pearling fleet only went out after Ramadhan and that it suffered bad weather towards the end of the season. (ii. ! ) ' u-nts (iii) Rent s. His Highness, who is himself a large owner of house property, has long wanted to amend the existing rent law and allow an increase in rents. On the 24th a meeting of the Rent Committee, appointed by the Political Agent and consisting of representatives of European firms, local merchants, landlords and tenants, was held at the Agency in order to consider a suggestion th.' t the percentage to be charged as rent should be raised from the existing rate of 4% to &lt;6% on the value of the property. Major J.E.H. Hudson, the Assistant Political Agent, presided. In the course of discussion it was pointed out by the representative of the local merchants that the assessed value of houses under the present rent law was far higher than their actual value as rents had risen progressively without check for some ten years before the law was passed. The Committee considered this point and found that the suggested rise would, in effect, be an increase of 50% in house rent, which, because of the high cost of living today, would make for increased inflation and a resultant demand for an increase in wages. They recommended therefore that there should be no increase in the percentage of rent charge able and expressed themselves as only willing to consider a rise if properties were reassessed excluding the value of the site. (iv) Venerehl Disease. At the representation of the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, the State Medical Officer, and other doc tors, the Bahrain Government are taking steps to combat the incidence of venereal disease in Bahrain, which, it has been stated, is amongst the highest in the world though no accurate figures are available. The Police have rounded up all prostitutes for medical examination, and free treat ment is being offered to those suffering from venereal disease. The Bahrain Government have asked that every person with venereal disease should u dergo treatment at the hands of a doctor and have orderee compulsory examination and treatment of any person who will not voluntarily under go it.

(ii) .. 6 0 • 9(ii) P etr o leum Develoiom e nt (Qatar) Limited . There have been a number of resignations over the last few months from amongst the engineering staff of the Company. The reasons seem to be a lack of many amenities and the fact that much of the construction ma terial for the company's building operations has not yet arrived and there is little work for their engineers, this leading to boredom. Many of those who have resigned have elected to go to East Africa in order to work on the development projects there. i 260. TRUCIAL COAST.

Land Department.....-3- 227 0 lu^ND DEPARTMENT „ The Bahrain Government is interested in de veloping some of the open land on the island for agricul tural purposes and recently asked the Bahrah Petroleum Company for an opinion on the possibility of supplying enough water to irrigate an area of 100 acres 0 The company have sent them a report on the water resources of Bahrah ^and giv^ it as their opinion that there are many areas where now cultivation could be undertaken without overtaxing the water^supply provided it is done in accordance with a scientific water conservation programme. They suggest as a first step that the Bahrain Government should set up a department to ensure that there is proper conservation of the islands’ water supply. It remains to be seen whether, and how energetically, the Bahrain Government will act on this suggestion. 228 . nUTQMifl IC TE LEPHONES . Reference paragraph 191 of Intelligence Summary ft last the new automatic telephone system seems likely to come into operation - in January next. Not all the delay can be attributed to a shortage of elec tricity as Messrs. Cable and Wireless have now enough elec tricity to operate the system. It appears that there is still a great deal of constructional work to be done and that they are unwilling to pay the high wages demanded by local labour. nn unskilled labourer demands as much -s Rs„3/- or Rs.4/~ per day and a carpenter or mechanic Rs. 8 /- per day. The Bahrah merchants have asked the Bahrain Government to retain the present telephone system until they and Messrs. Cable and Wireless can agro on the terms and conditions of the subscribers' agreement. They object to only 3 free calls a day being allowed them and say that they are willing to pay a higher subscription if the free calls could be increased to 10 a day. They also object, intur alia, to a clause in the agreement which states that the subscribers' telephone will be disconnected if he does not pay his subscription or other fees on time. They ask thnt - month's grace should be allowed to subscribers in v/hich to make payments. Some of their objections are reasonable, some childish and ignorant. The fact that Cable and Wireless Ltd. have a virtual monopoly in this matter precludes the working of the ordinary (or perhaps nowadays unusual) buyer- seller nexus. 229. LANDING .i.RRf NGBMBB TS .

To this Gray Mackenzie reply that the only crane at Manamah is an ancient hand crane and that they often have to keep barges with heavy Cc'rgo waiting at Sitra until those already at Manamah......-4- Manamah have been unloaded 0 The depth of water at the pier is often not deep enough for their power-driven barges ^ and this cuts down the time available for unloading them, 230.

He was therefore brought back to Bahrain and is now wandering round the town, (v) Reference paragraph (iv) of Intelligence Summary No,12, For the first few days after its opening the 'Pearl Cinema' showed to full houses and there were as many as three shows a day. But when the novelty of the interior decoration, the upholstered chairs, and the distorting mirrors in the gallery had worn off Bahrainis had many criticisms to make. Without air-conditioning, the cinema was a most un comfortable place to sit in during the summer months, the screen was too small, the projector and sound apparatus poor, and the quality of the films shown indifferent. us a result the 'Pearl' has been showing to almost empty houses. Its competitors the 'Bahrain Cinema' in Manama and the 'Muharraq Cinema' in Muharraq are doing much better. To them has been added another, the 'nl Ahli Cinema' which opened in Manama during September, The building is no more than a walled enclosure and has no roof, but the screen is large, the pro jector and sound apparatus good, and only films which have already proved their box office value in 'gypt or India are being shown. It can seat over a thousand persons and is running at present to capacity houses. (vi) The staple fare of the Bahraini cinema goer is the Egyptian film, but many Indian films are shown and there are large audiences for them. 'Kismet' and 'Mun Ki Jeet' were very popular, and at the moment 'The Flying Prince' which features a pugilistic heroine is providing a rival attraction to the Egyptian Cinema stars, Abdul Wahab, in 'Yom Said', and Omme Kalsoum, in 'Sallamah', (vii) The European community goes either to the Bapco cinema at Awali or the R.A.F. cinema at Muharraq. The Pearl&gt; -3- Pearl Cinema has shown one or two American films but soon withdrew them. Bahrainis find little to admire in most nnglish and American films.

It would, however, be a waste to have a doctor at Sitra solely for quarantine work. The Oil Company have built a dispensary there. 217. ROYAL NAVY . On the 15th H.M.S. 'Wren', Commander J.G.

(i) Reference paragraph 157 (i) of Intelligence Summary No. 11 . ^ Clear, the Cairo representative of British Cil Engines (Export) Limited, who are the Middle East agents of Messrs. Mirrlees, Bickerton and Day, visited Bahrain during the period under review and inspected the electricity system ol Manamah and Muharraq. His visit was at the in- vitat on of the Bahrain Government. His report confirms previous impressions that the supply of electricity has always lagged behind demand and stresses the need to order new generators immediately in order to cope with the fore seeable demand next year and the year after. As it will be some time before these generators can arrive and be installed 1949 will be another bad electricity year for Bahrain. (ii) Reference paragraph 190 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.14. Group Captain Leigh has already left Bahrain for the United Kingdom. 205. L ANDING ARRANGEMENTS . Reference paragraph 193 of Intelligence Summary No.14. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., have written to the Bahrain Government complaining that the many other points raised at the meeting had left no time for a proper discussion of the case for an increase in the landing charges. This is justified, they argue, because they are increasing their barge fleet at considerable cost to them selves and have recently stepped up the wages of barge crews from Rs.350/- to Rs.530/- per mensem. Further, the Bahrain Government have recently decreed that Customs employees must be paid overtime by the landing company for any work done after 3.00 p.m. This has meant that Gray, Mackenzie have also had to pay their own employees overtime after 3.00 p.m. They are willing, they say, to discuss these points with individual merchants or with a small committee appointed by the Bahrain Government; and add that while they will continue to charge the present rates until the end of 1948, they may consider it essential to increase the landing charges in the new year. 206. LABOUR. Reference paragraph 194 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.14. The higher wages being paid on the mainland (and in Qatar) is attracting not only the Bahraini labourer but also the office worker. In Bahrain, where salaries are more or less pegged to the Bahrain Government scale, he would be paid a starting salary of Rs.120/- per mensem; in Dhahran the Oil Company pay a Clerk as much as Rs.300/- to Rs.400/- per mensem. He may do even better if he works for an Arab • Contractor. Many of these men, who are earning very large sums, are illiterate and are paying their clerks as much as Rs.600/-w r r 1 Rs,600/- per mensem. Both Clerks and labourers are now paiu iri gold by ARi.MCO and the sale of this gold boosts salaries still higher. There is no shortage of clerks in Bahrain, however, as the Government Schools are still turning out yearly a sufficient number ..of young men with some pre- b &lt;, tensions to literacy to supply both the Bahrain Government and the oil companies. 207. PAKISTAN CURRENCY , The Karachi newspaper 'DAWN' reported in its issue of September 4th that ’’despite the overwhelming demand for Pakistan Currency' the Political Agent had issued a notice that all the transactions should be in Indian Currency and not Pakistan Currency. The paper calls this 'one more proof of Britain's anti-Pakistan policy'. The Political Agent has issued no orders regarding the currency to be used in Bahrain. At the request and on behalf of the Pakistan Government, however, he sent the Bahrain Government and Bahrain banks a copy of a note prepared by the Pakistan Ministry of Finance in which it was alleged that malicious propaganda had teen carried on in some countries in the Middle Bast with a view to sabotaging and discrediting Pakistan Currency. The Bahrain Government replied th^t it did not consider that there had been any propaganda in Bahrain directed towards the discrediting of Pakistan Currency. This was also the opinion of both the Bahrain banks. They added that Pakistan currency was being freely accepted by the banks, a charge of one anna for every ten rupees being made to cover the cost of its repatriation to Pakistan. A similar charge, they stated, was being made in purchases of Sterling Notes, Iraq Dinar Notes, and Egyptian Pound .Notes to cover the cost of repatriation to tieir respective countries. 208. PERSIAN CLi.IM TO BAHRAIN . Reference paragraph 196 of Intelligence Summary No.14. The Persians seem to be carrying on particularly intensive propaganda regarding their claim to Bahrain. A report was current recently in Manamah that a Persian Deputy had offered a large reward and grants of land in Persia to anyone (including, of course, Persians in Bahrain) who could bring forward proofs of the validity of the Persian claim to Bahrain. The origin of this report was said to be a Baghdad broadcast. A few days later an Arabic broadcast from Paris stated that the Shah had settled satisfactorily to Persia her claim to Bahrain with His Majesty's Government and that the islands were to be handed over to Persia. (i) Ghulam Akhtarzadah was once a servant of the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and is now the proprietor of a large new shop and restaurant called the Moon Stores He recently imported a consignment of apple cider and established himself for a time as the most popular restaurateur in the island. Bahrainis, who partake impartially of Scotch, local arak, and Eau de Cologne in secret, flocked to drink cider in public. The alcoholic content of the cider was negligible but such is the power of faith that many who drank it displayed allMpr SECRET„ BAHRAIN INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY FOR PERIOD 16th to 3lst August, 1948o 186 o MO VEME NTS OF OFFICIALS. | Npkr , v ’ o ,xs»i '■ , an (i) On the 19th Major J.E.H.

Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, were also present. Most of the meeting was spent in bringing up and replying to the old charges of pilferage of cargo and delay in transport ing cargo between Sitra and Manamah. Much time was also devoted to a discussion about the depth of Manamah harbour and suggestions that it should be surveyed. When the question they had met to discuss was eventually put to those present by His Highhess the merchants unanimously declined to agree to any further increase in the landing charges. 194. LABOUR. (i) There have been no great fluctuations in post war prices in Bahrain (controls have only been removed very gradually), but there is a flourishing black market, and the Bahrain economy is influenced by the inflation in Saudi Arabia. This is true especially of the labour market. The high wages being paid at Dhahran, Ras Tanura, and Dammam continue •-to attract labour away from Bahrain and the Government is reported to be contemplating the reintroduction of their former ban on the migration of labour to the mainland. The great discontent it aroused at the time and the fact that it would be extremely difficult to render such a ban really effective has so far deterred the Bahrain Government from re-imposing it. (ii) The Bahraini Labourer has always been a seasonal worker, either agriculturist or pearl diver, and though the moribund pearl industry no longer attracts him he continues as of habit to change the place and nature of his occupation. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have been attempting to chock the seasonal migration‘of their labour by introducing a pro vident fund for them, but without success. That the Company should give him money the labourer understands, but that he should again give it to the Company he does not understand, 195. FURTHE R L OCAL AFFnlRS, (i) On the 17th Shaikh Salman bin Muhammad bin Isa al Khalifah, one of the Bahrain Court Judges, who had been spending the summer in the Lebanon, returned to Bahrain. (ii) On the 17th His Highness left Bahrain on a visit to the neighbouring small island of Umm Na’san, which is the private property of the Ruling Shaikh. He was accompanied by his uncle, Shaikh Abdullah and other members of the ruling family. The party returned to Bahrain on the 19th. (iii) For many months past the Adviser to the Bahrain Government has had as one of his manifold activities the construction of a ’’water garden” outside Manamah town at, it is said, 'a cost exceeding Rs.10,000/-. Some marshy land has been reclaimed and filled in to make two artificial lakes the channel between iwhich is spanned by a 'willow pattern” bridge, while an octagonal bandstand in 19th century municipal style rears itself incongruously in the Bahrain scene. On the 24th, Mr. Belgrave held an aquacade, arranged by himself, to open the garden to the public. Practically all departments of the Bahrain Government were mobilised for tie occasion. The Shaikh's arrival was sounded by theof 'salute' followed inunediately by an 'interval' an Bolls across the Medow' (sic). Coloured lanterns were borne in procession round the two lakes and model boats were towed across the water by concealed men while spotlights Played and 'pearlers' sang plaintively in the distance, bwans, carved from plywood by the Adviser himself, apoeered on the water to the strains of (the programme stated)''The owan Lake Ballet Music' - only perceptible however by the eaare of faith. The 'piece de resistance' and finale was provided by young men who paddled small boats and set fire to a ^cloth and bamboo fort. Hi-s Excellency the Political ^siciont, the Political xigent and His Highness the Shaikh and other Shaikhs and notables were seated apart on a sort of ' grand stand. His Highness ? when asked what was goin^ on, opined that it was 'something Western'. What the other i.rabs made of these entertainments, most of which had featured when King Ibn Saud visited Bahrain in 1939, it is hard to imagine. (iv) Many cars are being sold by Bahrainis to Pakistani buyers, two or three cars being shipped by every ’down 1 steamer to Karachi. 0n the 19th a quarrel broke out amongst the Canadian crew of a tanker berthed at Sitra. One of the nature who attempted to intervene was 'beaten up' and when the Captain who was ashore, attempted to return, the men refused to allow him to get on board. The vessel was towed away from Sitra pier to prevent members of the disaffected crew gutting ashore and there were no serious results from thu affairs. The prospect of tanker crew coming ashore in Bahrain raises problems, (vi) PRICES OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES FOR AUGUST. Prices per kilogramme.

(It is firmly believed locally that the Bahrain Petroleum Company is controlled entirely from the United States.) All this talk is causing concern to the Shaikh of Bahrain and he has asked the Political Agent why no denial of the claim has been issued by His Majesty's Government. 197. TRUC IAL_C0i i ST, (i) F ujairah . About a month ago 10 robbers believed to be from the Beni Qitab attacked three of the Sharqiyeen who were also Fujairah subjects at Tuwi Rashid on the main Sharjah - Dhaid.road killing one and robbing them of what goods they had with them. The Shaikh of Fujairah took the matter up with the Beni Qitab but failing to get any redress he has now declared hostilities against them. Recently an important member of the Beni Qitab was killed by Sharqiyeen tribesmen in the vicinity of Khatt. They also killed by mistake a Mazrui^a Ras al Khaimah subject. The Beni Qitab retaliated by killing one of the Sharqiyeen but he was not a Fujairah subject, (ii) Abu Dhabi . . Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, has recently married a young bedouin girl (a child of 12 years) from the Abal Khali tribe. (iii) Pearling . During the period under report the majority of the Trucial Coast diving boats left for the diving banks. It is estimated that the number of diving boats/both large and small, which'have so far left is four times more than that which went to the diving during the earlier part of the # diving season, i.e., before Ramadhan. This increase is due to the fact that the prices of certain types of pearls have gone up in India which has led local as well as Indian mer chants to finance diving boats. The following is an estimate of the diving boats which have already sailed? * Dubai 180 Sharj ah 33 Abu Dhabi 140 Ajman 20 Jazirat al Hamrah 15 Umm al Qaiwain 5 Ras al Khaimah 5 Total 398 198.

While he was here he in formed the Station Manager, B.O.A.C. that K.L.M. intended to operate through Bahrain. He left for Basrah on the 3rd. 176. C ALLS . (i) On the 5th Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa A1 Khalifah, senior uncle of His Highness, called on the Political. Agent. (ii) Id ul Fitr was celebrated this year on the 6th by the Sunni community and on the 7th by the Shia community. The.Political Agent, Bahrain, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent, made the usual calls on His Highness the Ruler, his two uncles, and some of the notables of Manamah and Muharraq towns. His Excellency the Political Resident called informally on His Highness. 177. LOCAL AFFAIRS . (i) Reference paragraph 146 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.10. Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa returned from Egypt by air on the 1st. On the 9th he left with his wife and his mother-in-law for the Lebanon. (ii) On the 4th Shaikh Latifah bint Shaikh Ibrahim bin Khalid, wife of His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Bahrain, left by steamer for Karachi from where she will proceed to the Al-Hijaz for pil grimage. She was accompanied by her nephew, Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah A1 Khalifah, and sixteen male and female ser vants. It is learnt reliably that some of her servants succeeded in smuggling some gold sovereigns with them into Karachi. The fact that the Shaikha and her followers were exempted.from search by the Customs authorities at Karachi helped them to do so. (iii) Reference paragraph 193 (iv) of Intelligence Summary No.7. On the 7th Messrs. Khalid Aujan and Muhammad Ali A1 Sharif returned to Bahrain by air from Cairo. They areThey are reported to have greatly enjoyed their four months stay abroad having visited France, Italy, Switzerland, and Holland before going to London for the British Industries Fair. They spent some time in Cairo on their return and were there during an air rail on the city by the Zionist Air Force. (iv) On the 3rd Mr. N.L. Penfold assumed charge as Bahrain Manager of Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited vice Mr. C.E. Gahan who has left for India. (v) Reference paragraph 132 (vi) of Intelligence Summary No.9. During Ramadhan most of those who can afford it buy meat rather than fish. With the end of Ramadhan the demand for fish increased again out of all proportion to the supply. To those factors already mentioned which make for scarcity has been added the great heat of the coastal waters and the retreat of the fish towards the cooler deeps of the sea. Catches are therefore extremely small, and it is tasking the patience and ingenuity of Bahrainis to get any share in them. Sons of families prowl from beach to beach in swift motor cars, servants stand all day looking out to sea, and the approach of a fishing boat is met with a mad stampede of persons into tne shallows. The poor cannot buy fish. 178. PEARLING No.9. Reference paragraph 130 of Intelligence Summary Pearling boats began leaving for the banks on the 3rd day after Id ul Fitr and many have left. Preparations for this year's dive, however, have been very unhurried and there are a number of boats still in Bahrain. Only 37 large boats (carrying over 100 divers) have gone out. The industry is moribund. 179. UNITED STATES NAVY. No.12 Reference paragraph 169 of Intelligence Summary On the 3rd the U.S.S Bahrain en route to Kuwait. 180. IN DIAN/ PAKIS TAN I NDEPENDENCE DAY. The first anniversary of Indian/Pakistan In dependence Day was celebrated in Bahrain on the 15th August by a number of local Indian and Pakistani Clutis. The Political Agency observed the day as a public holiday. The Political Agent and His Highness the Shaikh attended an evening gathering held by the Pakistanis. Interminable, frothy, and fanatical speeches were the main items of enter tainments but provoked little response. Few local Arabs attended. 181 . ....... 'Greenwich Bav' leftLocal feeling seems to have got rather lukewarm on the Palestine issue. Recognition of the (goor shewing of the Arab armies, their disunity, and of the'*results of the early failure to reap the benefits of a compromise have contributed to this. The callous, Arab individualism has thus emerged undisguised-.;, in an attitude of indifference's towards the fate of tne refugees of their own race. 182. QATAR . The Bahrain Government has long had an under standing with local merchants that they must sell in Bahrain half of any consignment of cereals they import for retranship ment to another port. In order to avoid this levy, Abdullah Darwish, a Qatar merchant, recently had a shipment of 400 tons of rice consigned to Dubai instead of to Bahrain. The Shaikh of Dubai, however, adopted the Bahrain practice and forced Abdullah Darwish to sell half his consignment in Dubai. The remainder, further reduced by the theft of 400 bags at Dubai, was eventually sent to Qatar, its price having greatly increased. 183. T RUCIAL COAS T.

The nephew of the Regent extorted about Rs.13,400/- from some of the inhabitants of Khor Fakkan and is reported to be buying arms and ammunition with this money.

PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL C0ASTj_ TJMTTP.n. . ^ le Bahrain Manager of the Company has inquired from tne Political Agent whether in the event that Fujairah territory is considered to be of sufficient geological or other interest, it would be in order for his Company to enter into negotiations with a view to obtaining an oil concession from the Shaikh of Fujairah. The inquiry arises from the fact that while the Sultan of Muscat considers the Shaikh of Fujairah to be his subject, the latter does n^t recognise his claim, pays no zakat tr the Sultan or any Trucial Coast Ruler, and is in effectiv control of Fujairah territory. 127.

(i) Shaikh Hanad bin Abdulla, th^ second son and heir-apparent of the Ruler of ^atar, died at 12.30 p.n. .on the 27 th ^'lay in the Oil Conpany^s canp at Dukhan. Death was due to heart failure and toxaenia following an attack of dysentery. .early in ioay Shaikh Hamad, who was a chronic diabetic, obese, and c in poor general health, was taken ill with a fever and diajrhooa. He was trated for some days by an Indian doctor from Doha but as his condition did not improve, Dr. Anderson of Petroleum Development(Trucial Coast) Limited, was called m and had him removed to an air-conditioned bungalow at Dukhan. The patient’s temperature returned to normal and he seemed to be progressing favourably but about the 20th May he was seized with severe intractable pains t an&lt; ^ noc ^ : * Sol. Moody, medical Adviser to the 1 olitical Resident, was ahked on the evening of the 26th to visit ^atar to consult with Dr. Anderson, but no plane was available and the P.C.L, launch in which he travelled did not arrive until 2.30 p.n. on the 27th. The Political Agent visited ^atar by P.C.L. plane on the 28th and conveyed the condolence of His Majesty s Government and the Political Resident to Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Hamad’s family. Shaikh Ali bin ^bdullah, the eldest son of the Ruler, is lacking in intelligence and, though his name has b^on mentioned, it is not certain on whom the succession is to descend. Shaikh Abdullah is very old and may die any time. (ii) Shaikh Abdullah bin ^asim, of ^atar, has subscribed Rs. 1 , 00 , 000 /- to the fund for helping the Arabs of Palestine, while Rs,30,000/- was subscribed by his son, Shaikh Hamad. 129. ROYAL ,,IR FORGL (i) as a i r facilities are no longer required at Ralba by either the R.a.F. or civil aviation author ities, the Political Agent has been authorised to inform the iuler of Kalba that His liajesty’s Government do not intend to renew the Kalba air agreement which was signed in 1936 and is due to lapse in August of this year. (ii) On the 24th, an .*vro-Anson aircraft was flown from Sharjah to Bahrain by Group Captain Fairfield with one Navigator and 6 passengers. It develpped engine trouble at about half the way and turned back. The pilot had to crash land it on a reef. No one was hurt and all passengers put to sea in a dinghy and were brought into Bahrain next morning. 130. PURLING130. PICKLING Tho puarling souson is usually divided into two parts by tho nonth of Kanadan for which tho pearling floot returns to Bahrain. This year B.-nadan will corno to an ond on tho 6th *iUgust 9 and as there will be four months between that date and the cold weather during which pearling operations can be undertaken no pearling is being carried out before Hamadan. 131. R^LeiGTINij jj.ND B.dl.tWA.IN (i) King Ibn Baud's stock is said to have fallen amongst the local i^rabs who consider that he has taken second place to that of King ^bdullah of Transjordan in helping the i*rabs of Palestine. 132. LOOuL ;K'TK,IRS (i) Reference paragraph 89 (iii) of Intell igence Summary No. 6. The Bahrain Government have replied that they have searched the house of i*li Somali and that they have no definite information leading them to suppose that he is recruiting laboul?* They understand that the suggestion that i*li Somali was recruiting labour for work in Dhahran originated with the Iraqi interpreter of li. i.. S. ,r wRGN M . (ii) On the 14th a football match was played at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, between a Bahrain team and a team composed of Italian and Sudanese employees of uiujiCO. The Bahrain team wore leading by 2 goals to one when an altercation broke out between them and the Italian referee, the latter holding that only one player at a time could tabkle an opponent,-as a # result of which the Bahrain team walked off the field and the match was abandoned. The proceeds from the match were donated to the Palestine ^*.rabs. (iii) 0 n Friday the 28th there was a volley ball tournament between teams of Indians, Pakistanis, Persians and Bahrainis. It was won by the Pakistan team. (iv) The lack of residential accommodation in Bahrain still results in many suits for increase of rents. (v) Food Prices. The higher price of grain in Saudi Arabia has resulted most unfortunately in an outbreak of smuggling from Bahrain. Bakers have been oiling their quota of grain and at the same time, with the utmost effrontery, demanding an extra allotment on the grounds that the previous one had been all sold as bread. The Bahrain Government is considering preventative- 5 4.1 n u is al ^ 0st IrapoBsible at present to buy fish in the Bahrain bazaar. The ^??,erds of a fisherman’s lif* ^ '' * e' bloyment offered by the Ooraoan-i^.- ond &lt; 3 ^“cbncerns in Bahrain^ ^atar, and Saudi Arabia, i^ ve T&lt;?a riany fisherman to abandon their profession, and the Bahrain Government is offering further discouragement to those who remain by insisting that fish should be sold at the old rate of hs.l/ 8 /- per ruba for large fish and KsJ/- for small fish. (vii) While the consumer is being protected against the fisherman to the ultimate disadvantage of both, the removal of controls from the prices of many other commodities now flooding the Bahrain market is resulting in large profits (often as mach as 100 to 200 per cent) being made by local merchants, Indian, Arab, and Persian.

LANDING ARR ANGEMENTS. (A PERDNfrlAL) Reference paragraph 122 of Intelligence Summary No .11 of 1947. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Messrs. Yusuf Kanoo, the twtp landing companies in Bahrain, recently wrote and informed the Bahrain Government that they wished to increase the landing charges (a 15 per cent reduction in charges was ( made by the landing companies in June 1947). A meeting of the merchant, community was held at the Customs House to discuss this proposal at which the old complaints of delay in transporting cargo between Sitra and Manamah and damage and pilferage of cargo were made against the landing companies. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie sought to prove (both at the meeting and in subsequent correspondence with the Bahrain Government) that much of the damaged cargo had been damaged before it arrived in Bahrain, that pilferage of cargo had decreased in recent months, and that delay in transporting cargo between Sitra and Manamah was in large part due to the fact that the Shaikh Hamad swing bridge in the causev/ay between the islands of Manamah and Muharraq was only opened for one hour during the daylight and for a few hours after 12 midnight. They suggested that the Bahrain Government should place police guards on board the barges and offered to dismiss any of their unloading crew who had a bad police record. It was agreed at the meeting that landing charges should be increased by 15 per cent restoring them to what they were before the 15 per cent cut was made in June 1947. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government promised to post police guards aboard barges but warned Gray, Mackenzies that this would be for an experimental period at first and that the police were not up to full strength and could not allot sufficient men for this work. Regarding the closure of the swing bridge as the alleged cause of delays, he pointed out that the primary object of building the causeway was to facilitate road traffic between the two islands and that the frequent closure of the bridge to road traffic would greatly reduce its usefulness. He suggested that barges might travel around Muharraq, which is a small island, instead of passing between Manamah and Muharraq. 157. BAHRAIN ELECTRIC ITY DEPARTMENT.

Re-inforcements of Police were con centrated in the Fort and in the main City Police Static a while plain clothes men were stationed near the school - o prevent the demonstrs.tions which usually are the origin sf the rioting..,. ...r rioting 0 '’Wild Goose' had shore landing parties in readiness in case assistance was needed by the civil power or British lives or property were threatened. Perhaps be cause of these precautions, up to the present nothing untoward has happened except that in the main Girls' School the female teachers went on strike. They were informed that if they struck, they would not be employed any further by the Bahrain Government. They fell into hysterics and we j re only brought around by the suggestion of the wife of the Adviser that, instead of striking, they should say prayers on behalf of the Palestine Arabs for a quarter of an hour every day. Sven though there were no exciting incidents here, there were plenty of rumours, eg. (a) A B.O.A.C. flying boat was carrying a cargo of bombs through Bahrain to Tiberias for the Jews but had to turn back and then try again. (The origin of this was that a flying boat was stationed here for a. few days and made short flights testing new equipment.) (b) Outside Manama town the rumour went that 2000 British sailors had landed, cordoned the town, and were pre venting all movement in and out. (ii) The news of the invasion of Palestine by the armies of the surrounding Arab States was received with jubilation by the local population. Relief is felt at the prompt action that has been taken by the Arab States. The course of events in Palestine are being followed with great interest by all classes and the coffee shops arc crowded to a late hour every night by people listening to the radio news broadcasts. 119. LO CAL AFFAI RS. (i) On the 6th the Bahrain State Police held their Annual Field Day in the grounds of the Police Fort. The events were well organised and included horse races, tent pegging, high and long jumps, the pole vault, a sack race, and a 440 yards relay. The meeting was well attended, His Excellency the Political Resident and Lady Hay, His Highness Shaikh Salman, the Political Agent, and Shaikhs Mohammed and Abdullah bin Isa, the two uncles of His Highness, being among those present. (ii) On the 7th and 8th, the Annual Exhibition of Handicrafts was held at the Qhadhibiyeh Palace, Manamah, the exhibits consisting of work done by the Girls' Schools and the Boys' Technical School. Sales were brisk. (iii) As a result of the stoppage of supplies from Iran, the price of rice has increased from Rs.3/- to Rs.4/8 per Ruba. This increase is felt severely by the local middle class. (iv) It was possible to state in the Annual Administration Report that no case of small-pox had occurred during last year. This record has now unfortunately been broken by the appearance of 6 or 7 cases in Manama. (v) A second case of a lunatic seaman being landed and stranded in Bahrain has occurred. The previous one, a Spaniard, 1 i caused....-5- caused the Shipping Agents who were unfortunate enough o be saddled with responsibility for him a sum of Rs.5 9 00./-, and he had to be sent back to Spain with an escort of two Policemen, one of them an European Sergeant. The second ^ case is a coloured man. The tanker in which he arrives refused to take him away with a full.cargo of oil, some of which was inflammable; the Shipping Agents not unnatur- lly deny any responsibility on the owners’ behalf; and the Bahrain Government, although now saddled with him,* do net- wish to have him for an indefinite period in the lunatic asylum. All the parties concerned (except the lunatic) complained to the Political Agent that it was unfair to saddle them with any responsibility in the matter. 120.

SLi.VBRY . ) Abduction of persons into slavery is taking place on a ' small scale on the Trueda1 Coast but on a much larger scale from Muscat and the Batinah Coast. The A1 Bu Shamis and the Nai’m still turn a blind eye to slave dealing in their territories, and it is alleged that the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs in Buraimi afford ' . 1 ' asylum to bedouin robbers and abductors. The incentive to this trade is the presence in Buraimi of Saudi and Qatari slave traders who pay high prices for abducted persons for re-sale in Saudi Arabia Unless Saudi Arabia can be closed to this traffic there is little hope of H.M.G. being able to stop it on the Trucial Coast especially at this time of economic depression.

BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY, LIMITED. Mr. G-. ’VIIHERSPOON, Vice-President of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, who deals with the operations side, arrived in Bahrain on the 11th January. His visit was mainly to see how the deep test drilling now in progress is getting on. It has been estimated that results will be obtained after two or three months. The bore is expected to go to about 12,000 feet and Mr. RUSSELL BROWN, the General Manager of the Company, is hoping for successful results. Mr. BROWN when he called on the Political Agent on the 11th, told the latter how pleased he would be if his Company could open a well yielding 50,000 barrels a day although he was not serious in suggesting that such a very high yield would be obtained. It is understood that work on the deep test well which has so far been confined to straightening the hole at a depth of very nearly one mile, has been successful inasmuch as the former inclination of 4° has been reduced to 1-^°. 6. DUBAI . On the 2nd January, Shaikh SUHAIL BIN BUfl, a cousin of the Shaikh of Dubai, died in Ajman. The bazaars of Dubai were closed for three days. The deceased was one of the members of the Ruling family of Dubai and was expelled from Dubai after the attempted coup d'etat in 1938. He took up residence in Ajman. 7. FUJAIRAH . On the 29th December Shaikh HUMAID BIN ABDULLAH, nephew of the Regent of Kalba, arrived in Sharjah. His visit to Sharjah was at the invitation of the Shaikh of Sharjah who secretly sent him a letter and a verbal message through one ALI BIN HAZIM saying he wanted to see him and make friends with him. After his arrival HUMAID met the Shaikh of Sharjah several times but it is not known what passed between them. The Shaikhof Fujairah who is still in Ajman suspectel that the Shaikh of Sharjah's object in making friends with JIUMAID was to terrify him or instigate HUMAID against him now that he (Fujairah) has agreed to give protection to the inhabitancs of Wadi el Hilu which belongs to Sharjah. The Shaikh of Fujairah visited the Residency Agent soon after HUIiAID's arrival in Sharjah and reported to him that he suspected that this move by the Shaikh of Sharjah was directed against him and that if the case was such, he could deal very effi ciently with, both HUMAID and the Shaikh of Sharjah. In the meantime,- HUMAID came to call on the Residency Agent and, in the presence of the Shaikh of Fujairah, told che Residency Agent that so far the Shaikh of Sharjah has not disclosed the object of his invitation to him and assured him that should he (the.Shaikh of Sharjah) try to instigate him against the Shaikh of Fujairah he would refuse to act. The Shaikh of Fujairah was satisfied but he proposes to stay longer in Ajman in order to watch events. It may be remembered that last year the Shaikh of Sharjah took all possible precautions against HUMAID and ordered that he should not come to Sharjah.(vide paragraph .87(11) of intelligence Summary No. 8 of 1947). 8. KALBA . The inhabitants of Khor Fakkan and Subarah and Luliyah, two small villages adjoining Khor Fakkan, have turned out the employees of the Regent of Kalba from Khor.Fakkan and captured the fort and tower in that town. They have also sent a warning to Shaikh KHALID BIN AHMAD, the Regent, that he should not return to Khor Fakkan as they do not want him there. The Regent has not so far taken any steps against the inhabitants, but told the Residency Agent when the latter called on him on the 14th, that the uprising in Khor Fakkan was due to negli gence and mal-administration of his nephew HUMAID who had been put in charge of the affairs there. The Political Officer Trucial Coast, has been asked to visit Kalba and Khor Fakkan and report further. 9. ZUBARAH AGAIN . The Shaikh of Bahrain has protested against the Shaikh of Qatar's cultivating some land at Lish and Hiliwan and his utilising water from 'our two wells' for this purpose. 10. PEARLS. At a meeting held at the Adviserate on the 6th of January, 1948, His Highness Shaikh SALMAN BIN HAMAD was urged by the leading pearl merchants who attended it, to take all measures possible, in conjunction with the Ruler of Saudi Arabia and other Rulers of the Gulf States, to forbid the entrv of foreign pearls into the Gulf States. The meeting was called because during the last few days packets of Vene zuelan pearls and also pearls from the Red Sea were alleged to have been sent to Bahrain pearl merchants for disposal. The merchants represented that the pearl trade had been seriously hit by India’s ban on their entry into that country and that this latest danger would strike another blow at the Indus try.The Shaikh of Dubai is reported to have published an 'Alan prohibiting the import of Venezuelan pearls into Dubai. 11.
