U 1 . fys I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Government of India would permit one of the Bahrain Police N.C.Os., to enter the training course at Nasik for training as a Police Superintendent. The man in question is Havildar Abdul Karim, son of the late Police Superintendent Haj Sulman bin Jasim. He is an educated man and speaks and writes English, aged 25, a Bahrain subject, with eight years service in the State Police. In 1935 he did a course of police training in India, see correspondeiice ending with your St. Y &lt;T letter No. 812-6/2 of lltn May 1935 and my reply -yf'Zy- 'Mtii No. 188/16 of 21st May No. 188/16 of 21st May 1935. I have knov/n Abdul Karim for thirteen years and both from his antecedents and his character as a Superintendent of Police. I should like to send another man, as well as Havildar Abdul Karim,to India for training but up till now I have been unable to find a suitable man with sufficient knowledge of English. r '\ R Adviser to the Government.m © Private Dated the 19th March 1939. S# &lt;£l A I have been asked by the Bahrain Government if I can make arrangements for one of their police N.C.Qs to be sont to the Police School at Nasik for the Sub-Inspector’s Coarse. Before I write officially on this subject, I think it is only fair first of all to enquire from you whether an official request of this nature could be accepted without diiticulty x or whether you would find it embarrassing. 2. The N.C.O. in question is a man of very fair intelli gence and with a moderate knowledge of English, and I think that he should be able to keep his head above water all right if he is accepted for this course* The Bahrain Government would of course be tremendously grateful if this could be done; but none of us want to be a nuisance to you, for this would be a very poor return for all the great care and kindness which you and your officers have bestowed on Shaikh Khai-i^ah bin Mohammad. 5. Would you be kind enough to let me have a line privet ly saying whether I may go ahead with an official application or whether you would prefer that I should not do so. Yours sincerely. G.A.

We welcome such candidates because it results, we hope, in raising the standard of Police work in the States and, ’ when officers in the two Forces have known one another at the School, it facilitates the easy disposal of work: quite incidentally States’ students pay us financially. States candidates. I would stress rather the importance of knowing English sufficiently to follow the lectures. Candidates from our States know a local vernacular so they can be helped out by an instructor, but I fear we have nobody who knows Arabic* 4* The course lasts three terms of five months each: after the first and second term, there is a vacation of one month, but I fear this would not be sufficient for a Bahrain candidate to go home and back* After the final examination (at the end of the third term), all successful students get a month’s vacation and then join a district for 18 months’ practical training before of uniform, etc* Our own students are given an allowance of Rs*40 a month for maintenance: they have, however, to purchase their own uniform at the School* 2* There would be no difficulty or objection at all about this as we have candidates regularly sent us from our own 3* I enclose a Memo: giving details about the admission of confirmation: whether the Bahrain candidate should do any of this could be settled later* 5* In addition to the tuition fees payable to Government, the States have to pay their candidates for maintenance and purchase of uniform, etc* Our own students are given an allowance of Rs*40 6*L».--A 6 « Our next term will commence on 3rd July, so if the Bahrain Government wish to send a candidate, a formal requisition should please be addressed through the Resident to - The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political &amp; Services Department, The Secretariat, Bombay. In the meanwhile I shall provisionally keep a place for the Bahrain candidate-as we limit admissions to about 30 students for each-course. If there be any other detail you would care to know, I shall be glad to supply further information- Yours sincerely To H. Weightman, Esqr-, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain-Memo.

N Dear Weightman, I do not think I replied to your note enclosing the letter from Inspector General of police, which I now return. I think we only discussed it. I think Abdul Karim knows enough English ana I think he is a suitable man for this training. I should like to send two men but unfortu nately I cannot, at present, find a second suitable candidate. I have another young man, of the Khalifah, li ^.gggMB—WI l ll—t—... &gt; in view but his English is not good enough at present. Abdul Karim will be ready to go on 3rd July and I should be much obliged if you would send in the formal requisition. He is now a Havildar in the State Police and I will give him his navildar T s pay while on the course, if that is considered suitable, he draws Rs.46/- p.m. Yours sincerely, H.
