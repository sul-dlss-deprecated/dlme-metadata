With reference to your C.I50 of 8/4/33. The Iraq teachers were either ^ery discreet or ^ery harmless, I am unable to report anything unusual about thejr movements or their conversations except that they seem to have taken an excessive interest in all Government Departments, that is to say they visited all the offices to which they could obtain access as well as the schools. None of them came to call on me but at times they stood outside the windows on days when the Bahrain Court was sitting and listened witl - apparent interest to the cases. •'/*/&lt; Adviser.

The boys first sang at a dinner given by Shaikh Mohammad bin Isa, after the latter had read one of his poems on the subject of 'What fine chaps the Arabs arel' Their songs were not ordinary scouting songs, nor well- known songs such as they might have all known and sung spontaneously. The boys stood up to sing in regular rows, and the beat was given by one of their Palestinian teachers, named Ibrahim al *Id. (N.9. Of the teachers who accompanied them, only a junior one was a Kuwaiti). The subject of the songs was Palestine, the killing and ill-treatment of Arabs there. They sang about half a dozen 'nashids'. 3. On a later evening, at the Nadi al Mukhtabat ar- (l ? r. Vallance*s secretary) tried to interest them in games. 4 .
