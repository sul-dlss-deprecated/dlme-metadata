Sir, I have the honour to submit the following Report on Minor Operations in North and North East Persia from 1917 to 1921. During 1917, German and Turkish intrigue was directed towards stirring up the Pan-Islamic elements in Persia and Transcaspia with a view to alienating Afghanistan and thereby to threaten India. This necessitated the establishment of a military cordon, along the Perso- Afghan border. The force, known as the East Persian Cordon, was composed partly of Russian and partly of Imperrl troops from British India. ^ The Imperial Forces held the line from India to a short distance North of Birjand and Russian troops occupied the remainder of the Afghan border line to the Trans-Caspian Frontier. Owing to the Russian revolution of 1917, Russian troops were with' drawn in February 1918 with the result that the entire province of Khorassan was given over to anarchy, and became accessible for the unchecked movements of hostile armed bands and enemy agents. To remedy this state of affairs a detachment of the 19th Punjabis was immediately pushed up to Meshed, followed by a squadron and Headquarters of the 28th Cavalry, medical, and supply units and the remainder of the 19th Punjabis. Concentration of this force, which became known as the Meshed Military Mission was completed by July 1918, under the command of Major General W. Mallcson. From now onwards the Meshed Military Mission was frequently engaged in a series of operations against the Bolshevik troops in Tianscaspia, all of which were successful and added greatly to the prestige of our Imperial forces in Persia. The most important action was perhaps that of Dushakh (about 60 miles North East of Meshed) in October 1918, where Mission troops engaged a greatly superior force and completely routed the enemy with considerable loss. Our casualties amounted to killed British officer 1, Indian officers 2 Indian other ranks 52, wounded British officers 3, Indian officer 1, Indian other ranks 148. In April 1919 circumstances arose necessitating the withdrawal of the Mission Force from Transcaspia to Meshed. This was accomplished without incident. In May 1920 Brigadier-General Leslie took over command and in November of the same year the command of the Mission devolved on Colonel Redl.2 In May 1921 the Mission was withdrawn leaving a small Consular escort and intelligence centre at Meshed, with sufficient mechanical transport for emergencies. The conduct of our troops, both officers and men, engaged in the above operations is worthy of the highest praise. Appendices are attached enumerating the units employed in North and East Persia during the period under review, for your information. A list of recommendations will follow. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, EAWLINSON. Commander-in-Chief } India*T 3 Appendix A.
