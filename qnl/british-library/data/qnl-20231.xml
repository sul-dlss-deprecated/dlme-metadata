As regards the question of Sheikh Mubarak 1 s relations with the Bin-Saood the suggestion was made to the Secretary of State by telegraph on the 28th of April 1904 that, in view of the recent information regarding Turkish assistance to Bin Rashid, the Ottoman Government might again be warned against direct interference in the affairs of Fejd, as otherwise It might be necessary for His Majesty's Government to take measures to protect British interests in those regions.

I have received a telegram fron tre Consul at Basrah reporting that 4000 Turkish Troops with ten guns left Samawa on the 8th May in order to support Bin Rashid. I have now received a letter dated the 2nd May fron Bin Saood in which he protests against Turkish invasion and begs for British protection for him- -self and his country. Finally he urges the use of the telegraph in obtaining a reply fron the Briths Governnent. Sheikh Mubarak forwards to ne at the sane tine an original letter fron Bin Saood to himself of the same date as mine in which Bin Gaood reminds Mubarak that last year when the Russian and French men-of-war visited Koweit harbour, the Russians pressed him. Bin Saood, to take ^heir protection and that on that occasion, and also subse quently when the Russian Consul at Bushire repeated the overture he gladly rejected the offer altogether in consultation with Mubarak. rie continues t.iat the offer of assistancs nade by the Russians recurs to his nind now, but that it is not palatable and he prefers following the example of Mubarak, and has thereforeasked for British protection. if our reply proves discouraging he will doubtl^try the Russian Consul.

From—His Majesty^s Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, Please refer to your telegram dated the 20th May 1904 regarding Nejd affairs. Representations were'made by Sir N. O'Conor to the Porte on your telegram of the 28th April and were renewed on hearing from the Vice- \ Consul at Jeddah that troops were being assembled at Medina in order to assist the Amir of Nejd. He says that these representations may perhaps make the Sultan reluctant, but that they will hardly turn him from the course which he can fairly urge is calculated to prevent internal troubles and disturbance of the status quo. He adds that he does not see on what grounds he can press the Turks to desist from helping the Amir, who is the party attacked without appearing as a distinct partisan of Bin Saud. He also ad verts to questions of general policy, and points out that on these grounds there are objections against preventing the Turks from assisting the Amir against Bin Saud whose apparent object is tore-establish the Wahabi dynasty through- out Central Arabia, result of which might in the near future be fraught with serious consequences and might imperil our authority at Koweit where in the existing condition of affairs our influence is yearly growing stronger. Sir N. O'Conor's idea is that we should confine ourselves for the present to maintain ing intact territory of Koweit and awaiting developments, but that if the Turks persist, as he anticipates, in assisting the Amir, it might be expedient to reconsider the question of appointing a Resident at Koweit. Please let me have vour views on the above questions. In view of our declared policy of prohibit ing the traffic in arms, how would you propose to keep from interfering with the importation of arms for Bin Saud ? Telegram No. 174i8-E.A., dated the 29th May 1901. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Please see your telegram of the 25th May 1904. Our position in regard to the affairs of Nejd is explained in our Secret Despatch No. 69 of 24th March 1904. Representations might be made by Sir N. O'Conor to the effect that so long as the Turks refrained from interference in Nejd affairs, we also abstained from intervention ; that w r e have no desire to assist Bin Saud directly or indirectly; but that our interests in Eastern Arabia are such that we cannot view with indifference intervention on behalf of one of the parties contending for supre macy in Nejd which must affect the tribes with, which we have relations; that the relative rights of the two contending parties being so equal that the better course would be to leave both sides alone, both in the interests of peace and wdth a view to the avoidance of internal troubles. It might further be pointed out that the Turks were unable in 1902 to prevent filibustering expedition against Koweit starting from Turkish territory, and that the present support of Bin Rashid may strengthen him beyond Turkish powers of control, and produce situation which, having regard to our relations with Mubarak, we could not view with indifference. As to Sir N. O'Conor's view of the general political aspect of the situation, our opinion is as follows : the growth of our influence with Sheikh Mubarak has been concurrent with the success of his friend, Bin Saud, and our prestige at Koweit must suffer materially if, through our active inter, vention to prevent Mubarak assisting Bin Saud, and to prevent importation of arms, we permit Turkish influence to determine supremacy of the l urkish nominee against Bin Saud, which on analogy of the case of El Hassa of 18/1 would probably mean absorption of Nejd by the Turks. The destruction of Mubarak's influence and a possible attack from a direction which has not hither to been contemplated on Koweit territory, the limits of which towards the in terior are not defined, would naturally result from Turkish supremacy in Nejd. 1We might tlms be forced again to assist Mubarak actively against the Turks. The re -establishment of the Wahabi dynasty, which is now^ rather territoriai than fanatical, would, in our opinion, be open to less objection than this. We cannot agree therefore that our authority at Koweit would be imperilled by the success of Bin Saud, or that we can preserve Koweit territory intact better than by preventing Turkish intervention on behalf of Bin Ptashid. With reference* to my telegram, dated the 20th May 190i, we quite agree as to posting a Political Agent at Koweit and will immediately select one if you. approve. We think it not improbable that such action might have a whole- ' some effect upon Turkish attitude of mind. Up to the present no arrangements have been made with the Porte for combined suppression of traffic in the importation of arms which is briskly proceeding. It is not therefore a case of authorising Mubarak to import arms or even of relaxing existing measures for the prevention of the traffic, but of merely allowing matters to remain as they are. We can, if the Turks protest offer to do our best to prevent trade on the understanding that they will refraia from interfering in Nejd affairs, and co-operate with us in the manner suggest ed in our Despatch dated the 31st March 1903. An admission of our supremacy in Koweit that would be useful to us hereafter would result from such a protest. 3 Q ' c ' Pres. Simla,—No, 601 F, D.-1-6-04—51—j.W.nooa Ao.

O'Oonor to the Llarquess of Lansdowne,-(Reed.June 20) (Uo* 448) Therapia, June 13, 1904. L!y Lord, I have noticed with pleasure the conclusion, as re ported in paragraph 9 of the Ilemorandum of External Affairs which the Government of India forwarded to me in your Lordship's despatch Ho. 196 of the 7th instant, of an arrangement come to 'between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Sheikh of Koweit, permitting the establishment of a British post-office at Koweit with an understanding that no other foreigj post offices shall 'be opened. In your Lordship's telegram Ho. 19 of the 4th February last it was stated that it was proposed in the event of such an arrangement as the above being come to, to place the post office in charge of a subordinate native medical officer; and in my telegram Ho. 17 of the following day I replied that while seeing no objection to the proposal, it seeed to me possible that the Turkish Government might object to the establishment of a BritishBritish post-office at Koweit as an infringement of the status quo ♦ Since the exchange of the above telegraphic cor respondence, I have, under instructions from your Lordship made representations as reported in my despatch Eo, 37E, Con^idential, of the X6th ultimo to the Sublime Porte upon the subject of the continued presence of Turkish soldiers on Bubian Island, which forms part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Zoweit; and I have received an assurance from Tewfik Pasha that the question should be submitted tn the proper quarter, Tithout questioning the advantage of the new pos tal arrangement I would venture to submit to your Lordship^s consideration that it would be advisable under the existing conditions to delay sending an official to assume control of the post office until we see probably in a few months 1 time, the result of my representations respecting the military post on Bubian Island, I presume that should my representations meet with no result. His Uajesty's Government will encourage and support the Sheikh of Koweit in stationing men on Bubian Island, and if, at the same time, a post-office official was appointed at Koweit, the effect of the action taken would be enhanced, and the danger of the situation would be' Mil be made clear to the Turkish. Government. The question of the Sheikh of Koweit's olaim to sovereignty over Urn Kasr is so closely connected with his claim to Buhian Island, that it may not he out of P -^ace to call attention to two statements in connection with that place which occur in Captain H. Smyth's Report upon the Adana-Persian Gulf Railway, which was submitted to your Lordship's Department by the Intelligence Depart ment of the ^ar Office in their letter of the 6th ultimo. The first is made in speaking of the probable terminus on the Persian Gulf under 'Probable Railway Route', and is to the effect that Captain Smyth considers that Um Kasr offers superior advantages to T^oweit or Kadima. The second is to wards the end of the Report under the heading 'Special Reports of Places', when Captain Smyth states that he ■ learned on the spot that the old forl'hf TTm Kasr is general ly held to have been built by the grandfather of the pre sent Sheik of Zoweit, and that it was occasionally occupied during the spring months by Arabs from that place.

COX, c.i.e., POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Dated Simla, the 7th September 1904. Sir, I am directed to address you regarding the recently-created appointment of Political Agent at Koweit. 2. As notified in Foreign Department telegram No. 2457, dated the 3rd August 1904, Captain Knox will take up the appointment, but will so act as not to attract unnecessary attention. His first object should be to cultivate and maintain close and friendly relations with Sheikh Mubarak and the principal personages in Koweit. The interests of British trade and traders at Koweit and in the adjacent tracts of Arabia should be safeguarded, and a vigilant watch kept over the proceedings of the Turks on the boundaries of Koweit territories. Matters tending to show an intention, on the part of the Turks or any other Power, to interfere with, or disturb, the existing status quo or anything which would lead to a belief that any other Powers have designs on, or in connection with, possible harbours within or without Koweit territory should at once be reported. Special regard in this respect should be paid to Khor Abdulla and the waters round Bubiyan Island and Um Kasr, but Captain Knox should be careful not to display undue apprehension or uneasi ness on this point, or, in default of definite instructions, to interfere actively in matters affecting these places. 3. Any attempt on the part of the Turks, or others acting from Turkish territory, to encroach on or beyond the limits of Hejeje and Subhieh should be forthwith reported. Captain Knox should, however, endeavour to ascertain if these places really represent the bounds of Shiekh Mubarak's effective occupation at present. 4. He should further endeavour to secure early and accurate information regarding the struggle between the Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud families for the supremacy of Nejd. His Majesty's Government have instructed Sir Nicolas O'Conor to inform the Turkish Government that, as repeated warnings have been given to the Sheikh of Koweit against participating in any insurrection ary movement, they have a right to expect that the Porte will use their best endeavours to restrain the Amir of Nejd from embarking on a course of action which might endanger the peace in those regions, and the Ambassador has been further requested to express the hope, in regard to the assistance given to Ibn Rashid, that the Turkish Government will avoid taking any action which might still further add to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia, the tranquility of which is a matter of interest to His Majesty's Government as well as to that of the Sultan.In connection with this question I am to forward, for your information, a copy of the marginally noted correspond.

Dine , Esq., I .C.S., Secretary to the Government of India, in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential letter No. 36-E. A., dated the 6th January 1904, in which yon enquire whether, in my opinion, it would be practicable and advisable to depute a European officer to'visit the capital of the Saud family for the purpose of collecting intelli gence. 2. As to the practicability of the proposal, it would, I believe, be impossi ble for an Englishman, undisguised, to find his way to Riadh either from Katif or Ojair. The Turks would almost certainly, at the present time, prevent him from going through. As regards the route from Koweit, I directed my Eirst Assistant, Captain'Hunt, during his recent visit to Koweit, to ascertain confi dentially from Sheikh Mubarak his views on the subject. The Sheikh informed Captain Hunt that the road was clear and that there would' be no difficulty in arranging for an English officer to visit Riadh. He would settle the matter with Abdul Rahman bin Eeysal, and would send an escort ana one of his own sons with the officer to take him to Riadh and bring him back. There was, he said, no risk and the officer would be able to travel quite openly. Captain Hunt further reports that Mubarak appeared to be pleased with the idea, and said that he thought it would be a good thing for an English officer to visit Riadh. Not long ago, the Vali of Busreh had sent two Germans to him with a letter asking him to see them through to Riadh, but he had refused and sent them back on the ground that he could not undertake the responsibility for their safety. 3. It is, of course, natural that Sheikh Mubarak, whose sympathies with the cause of the Saud family are so well known, would welcome any stop which might be construed as a sign of interest on the part of the British Government in the affairs of his friends. Notwithstanding the fact that the officer would be going to Riadh merely for the purpose of collecting intelligence and without any political mission, it would be difficult for Sheikh Mubarak to believe that such was the case. He, as well as Ibn Saud, would, 1 think, look upon it as an open espousal by us of the latter's cause, and, for the visit is not one which could be kept a secret, this would also be the view taken by the Turks and Ibn Rashid. I am further inclined to doubt whether, by a simple visit to Riadh and back the officer would be able to obtain much intelligence of a useful and compre hensive nature. The information which he would gain would certainly be somewhat one sided. He would have, I think, to remain in the country for some time, and this perhaps would hardly be advisable. 4. While, then, fully admitting that it is desirable that the Government of India should be more conversant than it is at present with events in Nejd and Riadh, I cannot help thinking that the deputation of an officer to visit Riadh is not altogether desirable at the present juncture. So far as Ibn Saud is con cerned, the position of affairs appears to be fairly well known. He has reinstated 3V i * himself in the ancient Wahahi capital and has suceeded in extending bis authority over a considerable part of the neighbouring country The fact that the Amir of Nejd has hitherto failed in re-as?erting his authoiK\, cprtainly givgs colour to the belief that Ibn Rashid's power is on the wane. Sheikh Mubarak's confidence, however, in the utter disiup ion of tlie po^ei ol the Xejd Amir docs not appear to be entirely justified, and it is quite possible that the latter may succeed in gaining the upper hand and in again expelling Ion baud. A visit in dissruise by a competent European officer to both Riadh and Ibn Eashid's country, would, I believe, be more likely to be useful, but I could hardly recommend such a visit under Sheikh Mubarak's auspices.-niiT ■•3fai To No. 69 Of 1904.

His Majesty's Government are aware that, throughout a great part of the nineteenth century, the Government of India had frequent intercourse with the Wahabi Amirs, and that in 1866 Muhammad-bin-Abdulla entered into a treaty engagement with our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, whereby he bound himself not to Oppose or injure British subjects residing in his territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government. Since the Turkish occupation of El Hasa and the rise of the Amirs of Nejd, however, our relations with the Wahabi house have ceased, and we now have no intercourse with either of the great Arab factions of this part of the Arabian Peninsula. Recent schemes for trans-continental railways, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, and the active prosecution of the Hejaz Railway by the Turks, one feature of which is said to be a branch through Nejd to El Hasa, coupled w T ith the gradual diminution of Turkish authority and the steady growth of foreign interference in these quarters, lead us to think that it may shortly be incumbent on us to take a more lively interest in the affairs of Central Arabia. The question was forced upon our notice by the interview, which occurred at Koweit in March 1903, between the Captains of the ' Infernet' and the ' Boyarin' with Abdul Aziz- bin-Saud, and we recently addressed our Political Resident regarding a suggestion to depute a British officer to visit the capital of the Saud family for the purpose of acquiring intelligence. In view of Colonel Kemball's reply, we do not propose to proceed with the scheme at present. Later, however, when the political situation in Nejd has developed, and above all if the present re presentative of the Wahabi family, Abdul Rahman-el-Saud, succeeds in estab lishing and extending his ascendency, which from the latest accounts received seems to be not improbable, we think that it may be desirable again to enter iinto relations with our old ally. ^ e have noted the instructions conveved in your Secret telegram of the 8th February 1903, and in the autumn of the present year we hope again to address His Majesty's Government regarding this question.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of No. 238, dated 7th November 1903. India, copy of the marginallj - noted letter which I have received from the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, regarding the state of affairs in Arabia. No. 238, dated the 7th November 1903 (Confidential). From—J. C. Gaskin , Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball , C .I .E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that an influential resident of Hafoof, named Sheikh Abdul Uahman-bin-Salman, who, it will be remembered, in August 1895, brought to Bahrein the letter of the Mutessarif of A1 Hasa, re-asserting Turkish pretensions and threatening that, failing the restoration of the Al-bin-Ali boats seized by H. M. S. ' Sphinx ', an attack would be made by the Katr tribes on Bahrein from which British subjects should be removed within seventeen days, called on me on the 4th instant, and in the conversation he made some import ant disclosures regarding the state of affairs in Arabia and the attitude of the Arabs towards the Turks, which I consider of sufficient interest to lay before you. Sheikh Abdul Bahman stated that the aspect of Arabia is changing rapidly, and a strong desire for secession from Turkish rule is noticeable from all sides ; that the Arabs are well provided with modern arms and now feel their strength and no longer fear the Turks or consider them invincible, and he referred to Sheikh Mubarak and Bin Saud as cases in point. He believed that Bin Bashid will eventually lose Nejd, judging from his abortive attempts to reduce Biadh and other places retaken by the Saud family ; that when the latter are relieved of Bin Bashid they will undoubtedly attempt the recovery of A1 Hasa from the Turks, in which it is expected they will succeed, provided the circumstances undergo no change. The Turks, he stated, were able to occupy A1 Hasa through the co-operation of the Chiefs of Koweit and the Montifik Arabs, but the situation is now changed, and the Sheikh is unlikely to give any assistance, and it is doubtful whether the Montifik Arabs would take part in any future movements. The nomad Bedouins, according to Sheikh Abdul Bahman, are quite indifferent as regards who rules over them, as they acknowledge no settled Government and will follow any one who will make it worth their while ; and the inhabitants of A1 Hasa are deeply dissatisfied with the Turks and are ready to drive them out and are capable of keeping them at bay for four months until outside support reaches them, but the fear of obtaining no permanent assistance from outside deters them from striking for their independence. He enquired whether, in the event ot f the people of A1 Hasa driving the Turks out of the district and applying subsequently to His Majesty's Government for protection, they would get it, and if that was impracticable whether some place would be given him in Katr where he and his followers could settle down under British protection. I told Sheikh Abdul Bahman that it was not the custom of His Majesty's Government to intrigue with the subjects of an established State on friendly terms with it, and I advised him to entertain no hope of a successful issue from proceedings of the nature he refers to, and that as regards Katr it was under Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani and his brother. He appeared to feel very much disappointed at the discouragement he received, and expressed a wish that his statements should be treated as strictly secret, and that he may be permitted to write to me occasionally, at which I informed him that I shall always be glad to receive any authentic news of the interior.

It is very desirable that the Government of India should be more fully conversant than they at present are with events in Nejd and Riadh, and I am to enquire whether in your opinion it would be practicable and advisable to depute an European officer to visit the capital of the Saufi family for the purpose of collecting intelligence. It is understood that the disturbed condi tion of El Hasa makes the direct route from Ojair or Katif to Hiadh unsafe, but it has been suggested that arrangements might be made to obtain a safe conduct from Koweit through the good offices of the Sheikh. I am to request that, if you see no objection, you will sound Sheikh Mobarak as to whether the road is open and as to whether the officer performing the journey should proceed openly or in disguise.

I have laid before tbe Marquess of Lansdowne your letter of 4th February, forwarding correspondence between the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India, on the subject of a visit of Sheikh Abdul Bahman-bin-Salman to the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, with the object of entering into closer relations with His Majesty's Government. Lord Lansdowne concurs in the telegram which Mr. Brodrick pro poses to address to the Government of India to the effect that no steps are to be taken for sending agents to Nejd, or for entering into closer relations with the tribes, without the sanction of His Majesty s Government. His Lordship, as at present advised, doubts the wisdom of entering upon a negotiation with the tribes in question, but, before replying upon the subject, lie desires to consult His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople.

The previous sanction of His Majesty's Government must be obtained before any steps are taken with a view to entering into closer relations with Nejd or to sending agents there. Enclosure No. 4. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, 18th March 1904. With reference to your letter of the 4th ultimo, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copies of correspondence with His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject of the proposal of the Government of India to send a Political Agent to enquire into the condition of Nejrl. It will be observed that Sir N. O'Conor does not consider that this step would be advisable at the present moment, though he is of opinion that the proposal should be borne in mind. I am accordingly to suggest that the Government of India should be informed that His Majesty's Government would prefer that no such action should be taken for the present. The question might be made the subject of further consideration when more detailed information is received as to the methods by which it is proposed that (he investigation should be conducted. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State T. H. Sanderson. for India. Annex 1. The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir N. O'Conor. No. 50. (Confidential.) Foreign Office, ^ ir » . 15th February 1904. I transmit to your Excellency herewith copy of a letter from the India Office, forwarding correspondence relative to the condition of affairs in the interior of Turkish Arabia, in which a proposal is made by the Government of India that a European officer should visit Hiadh in order to report on the state of the tribes. I also enclose a copy of the reply which I have caused to be returned. Your Excellency will observe that the Government of India have been informed that no steps are to be taken to enter into closer relations w T ith Nejd, oi to send agents there, without previous consultation with His Majesty s Government. It will be within your Excellency's recollection that, since the date of the Koweit Agreement, proposals have successivelv been made for the extension of British protection to the territories of the Sheikhs of Ko^eit and El Katr and ot the Amir of Nejd, and that on each occasion His Majesty s Government have, after full consideration of the circumstances, decided that it would be inexpedient to incur the difficulties and embarrassments involved. In the present instance, though it is no doubt desirable that His Majesty's Government should be in possession of fuller information with regard to the interior of Arabm, the proposed course of deputing a European officer would, in all piobability^ lead to further proposals for establishing closer relations tbe Sau{1 laiml y 5 to which there would be objections at least asgreat as in the case of the overtures made on behalf of the Chiefs of Nejd and El Katr. In particular, the advice repeatedly given to Sheikh Muharek of Koweit to abstain from all participation in the insnrrectionary move ment against the Amir of Nejd, of which the Sand family are the prime moveis, rencleis it inadvisable that His IVTaJesty s Government should be committed to any course or action which would appear to give encourage ment to the latter, or which could be represented by the Turkish Government as a breach of the understanding between the two Governments for the maintenance of the status quo in those reoions. Before, however, replying finally to the India Office, I should be glad to be furnished with your Excellency's observations upon the subject. I am, &amp;c., Lansdowne. The Eight Hon. Sir N. R. O'Conor, G.O.B., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Annex 2. Sir N. O'Oonor to the Marquess of Lansdowne. No. 129. (Confidential.) Constantinople, My Lord, 26th Eebruary 1904. In your Despatch, No. 50 (Confidential), of the 15th instant, your Lordship is good enough to ask my opinion regarding a proposal to send a political agent into the interior of Arabia to report on the condition of the tribes, more especially with regard to the situation of affairs at Biadh and Nejd. I venture to express my concurrence in the objections stated in your Lordship's above-mentioned Despatch to sending a special emissary to either place, at all events just at a moment when the susceptibilities of the Turkish Government have been excited by the visit of the Viceroy of India to the Arabian Coast, and the hopes of the Arabs, who are well disposed towards His Majesty's Government, have been raised to a point which may indirectly encourage them to engage in a movement against the Ottoman rule and authority. At the same time, I feel that it would be no doubt useful to have fuller information than we possess in regard to the position of affairs in the interior, and while thinking the present moment unfavourable, I consider it most important not to lose sight of the proposal. The troubled condition of affairs and the internecine feuds, which threaten at any moment to assume formidable proportions, make it very important that we should understand the exact condition of affairs, and be in a position to make up our minds as to the policy to be followed in case of a serious revolutionary outbreak and the cessation of Ottoman rule in El Hasa.

They state, however, that, should the development of the political situation in Nejd appear to them to render it desirable, they will again address His Majesty's Government on the subject of the policy to be pursued. Mr. Brodrick, it will be observed, has informed the Government of India that His Majesty's Government agree in the view that no action in the matter should be taken for the present.

G orst , Esq., To—The India Office from the Foreign Office. With reference to your letter of 1st September relative to the proposal of the Government of India that surveys more extended than those ahea y tioned should, be undertaken by the Investigator in the neighbour oo o Koweit, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to enclose copy o a despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople containing obser vations on the subject. Lord Lansdowne concurs in Sir N. O Conor s opinion that there is no objection to the proposal. The second paragraph of the despatch deals with more general questions and I am to request that Mr, Secretary Brodrick s attention may e par i cularly called to His Excellency's observations in regard to possible representa tions by the Turkish Government on the subject of the appointment ot a British Agent at Koweit. The Turkish authorities have already taken notice of the change as will be seen from the despatch to Mr. Town ey, i o. copy of which is enclosed, and it appears to Lord Lansdowne very esira e decide what answer should be returned, to any further enquiries w nc may e made. After correspondence between the two Departments in August 1003 e conclusion was arrived at ' that it would be best, for the present at ffast, to avoid raising a difficult and inconvenient question with theiuiKisi - ment by appointing a British officer to reside permanently in ^ wel * , that it would be sufficient that an officer should be deputed by the ConsalV/o „ . ■ Rll&lt; , WrP to visit Koweit from time to time remaining there for such time as mf 'ht be desirable, and, if necessary, repeating bis visits at intervals uTtil Zresidence becomes practically permanent. His Maiesty 's Government are therefore m a position to maintain that no permanent appointment has been made by them which could be regarded as a the status quo in those regions, and Lord Lansdowne would 'st that tho Turkish Government should be so informed if tbey raise the question It might be added that while the Mission of Major Knoi is a special and temporary one, His Majesty's Government must, ^ view of their arrangements with the Sheikh, reserve to themselves the rigb to depute an office?to visit Koweit from time to time, at their own uncontrolled discretion as to time and length of stay, in order to report upon the state ot affairs at that place and to ensure the successful continuance of the already arrived at. . „ , It is, however, essential, should this line of argument eventually be adopted, that the policy agreed upon in August 1903 should be strictly carried out by the withdrawal of Major Knox from Koweit after a reasonable interval. I am to suggest, therefore, for Mr. Brodrick's consideration, that the Government of India should be reminded of the limited character of Major Knox's mission, and should be invited to indicate a suitable moment for his temporary withdrawal. Sir N. O'Conor , to Marquess o£ Lansdowne, ^ 0, Therapia, 19tli September 1901 My Loud, With reference to your despatch No. 326 of 13th September respecting the proposed survey operations of the hfivestigcttov I do not think much is to be gained by abstaining from surveying the Chor Abdullah and the Bubiau Island channel out of complacency to Turkey, while, on the other hand, having in mind the disputed ownership of the island, we should, if anything, gain something by making evident to the Turks our views in regard to that question. I have had no answer as yet from the Minister for Foreign Affairs with reference to my demand for the withdrawal of the Turkish Military station on the South East (A1 Geil) point of Babian, but, on the other hand, I have not pressed the matter very hard, as I have kept it as a reply to the representations which are likely to be made at no distant date in connection with the appoint ment of a British Agent and the establishment of a British Post Office at Koweit. Meantime I see no objection to the proposed survey of the Investigator. I have, etc., N. E,. O'CONOR. Marquess of Lansdowne to Mr. Townley. No. 364. October 20, 1904. Sir, The Turkish Ambassador enquired in the course of last month whether it was true that His Majesty's Government were sending a consul a considerable sum of money and many bags of rice to Koweit. He had seen a report to that effect and asked the question merely for his own information. No definite reply was returned to His Excellency and he has not since reverted to the subject. Should the question again be raised in London, nothing will be said inconsistent with the view held by His Majesty's Government in regard to tne deputation of a British Agent at Koweit of which Sir N. O'Conor was informed in my despatch No. 234 of August 20th 1903, and you should bear in mind the language used in that despatch in the event of your beiHo questioned by the Turkish Government,H.MoS* 'Sphinx' at Busrah, 29th.

I am, etc., A. GODLEY. SlE, Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, 13th August 1903. I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, forwarding copy of a telegram from the A iceroy of India, in which he advocates the appointment of a British .Resident at Koweit, proposed by His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, unless the alternative proposal of the Government of India be accepted, that an officer of the Indian Service should be appointed Consul at Mohammerah, who should also have Koweit under his superintendence and be provided with a vessel for the purpose of making frequent visits to that place. As the Secretary of State for India is aware. Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that the Consul at Mohammerah should devote his attention to the very important questions of trade and roads in that locality and the surrounding districts. It appears to Lord Lansdowne to be undesirable that he should be taken away from these duties for the purpose of dealing with an en tirely different class of questions connected with Turkish Arabia. His Lordship is unable to see that there is any force in the argument advanced by the Viceroy that visits to Koweit by His Majesty's Consul at Basrah would strengthen and recognise the connection between that vilayet and Koweit. The Consul is at the present moment the necessary intermediary between the Sheikh and the Vali in the many questions which arise as to the fcheikh s property, and it might equally be agrued that visits by His Majesty 's Consul-General at Bushire to Bahrein indicate a connection between the latter island and Persia. . . Lo . 1 f d Lansdowne does not, however, wish to press the proposal, suggested originally by the Secretary of State for India, that the British Consul at Basrah should be placed in regular superintendence over Koweit.

No. 459. (Secret.) M y L ord, With reference to the Secret telegram from the Government of India to Lord George Hamilton of the 81st July last, I beg to say that I entirely dis agree with Major Kembairs theory that while affording the Sheikh of Koweit naval protection as against the Ottoman Government, we are under no obliga tion to interfere with any aggressive or hostile proceedings which he may take against a tributary of Turkey such as the Amir of Nejd. As a matter of fact the Porte have on more than one occasion asked that the influence of His Majesty's Government may be used to prevent the Sheikh from marauding or attacking his neighbours. The immunity from Turkish aggression which His Majesty's Government has desired to secure to him seems to me to carry with it the responsibility of preventing him, as far as lies in our power, from under taking offensive operations against chieftains or tribes assumed to be under the suzerainty of Turkey. The arguments in favour of the appointment of a Resident at Koweit are so clearly set forth in the Viceroy's telegram that I feel there is no necessity to make further remarks, except to express the hope that the proposal may be favourably entertained by His Majesty's Government. I have, etc,, The Maequess or Lansdowke to Sir N. O^Conor. Foreign Office, No. 234. (Secret.) , Q v 20th August 1903. Sin ' I hare received Your Excellency's Despatch No._ 459 (Secret) of the 10th instant, advocating the appointment of a British Resident at Koweit. I have already been in communieation with the Secretary of State for India in regard to the questions raised in the telegram from the Government of India of the 31st July, to which Tour Excellency refers, and I transmit, for vour information, copies of the correspond' # From India Office, dated 13th August 1903. ^ Vina rm^pd On the SUbiect. To ditto, dated 13th August 1903. ence * which has passed on tne su ujecu Your Excellency will observe that both Lord G. Hamilton and mysel have, after careful consideration, arrived at the conclusion that, notwithstand ing the various arguments which have been uiged in avo p 9 J 1 i /27 to appoint a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit, such a course would scarcely be in harmony with the admission which lias repeatedly been made by His Majesty's Government that Koweit is within the Turkish Empire, and could, indeed, hardly be considered otherwise than as a departure from the status quo, on the maintenance of which His Majesty's Goverumeut have laid so much stress in their previous discussions on the subject. I concur in Your Excellency's opinion that His Majesty's Government may not infrequently find themselves called upon to exercise their influence in restraining the Sheikh from attacking his Arab neighbours, as well as in pro tecting him from aggression at the hands of the Turkish Government. But that influence has upon more than one occasion been so exercised under exist ing conditions, and a perusal of the printed confidential correspondence during the months of September and October 1901 in particular sliows that the media tion of the Political Resident and of British Naval officers in the Persian Gulf was successfully employed at a time of serious inter-tribal disturbance, and that it was received by the Turkish Government with satisfaction. The conclusion of the hostilities then in progress between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Amir of Nejd was followed by an amicable understanding with the Turkish Government, recorded in my note to Anthopoulo Pasha of the llth September 1901, which has since that date formed the basis of the relations between the two Governments, and the adoption of the present proposal might seriously impair its successful continuance. His Majesty's Government are, therefore, of opinion that it will be best, for the present at least, to avoid raising a difficult and inconvenient question wdth the Turkish Government by appointing a British officer to reside per manently at Koweit, and that it will be sufficient that an officer should be deputed by the ConsuL General at Bushire to visit Kow r eit from time to time, remaining there for such time as may be desirable, and, if necessary, repeating his visits at intervals until his residence becomes pratically permanent. For the reasons stated in the correspondence inclosed in this despatch they are also of opinion that the attention of His Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah will be more profitably directed to the very important questions in that locality, and they consider that business connected with the relations of the Sheikh with Turkish officials at Basrah should be conducted as heretofore through His Majesty's Consul at that place.

His Majesty's Government are, therefore, in a position to maintain that no permanent appointment has been made by them which could be regarded as a disturbance of the status quo in those regions, and Lord Lansdowne would suggest that the Turkish Government should he so informed if they raise the question. It might be added that while the mission of Major Knox is a special and temporary one, His Majesty's Government must, in view of their arraDgements with the Sheikh, reserve to them selves the right to depute an officer to visit Koweit from time to time, at their own uncontrolled discretion as to time and length of stay! in order to report upon the state of affairs at that place and to ensure the successful continuance of the modus vivendi already arrived at. It is, however, essential, should this line of argument eventually be adopted, that the policy agreed upon in August 1603 should be strictly carried out by the withdrawal of Major Knox from Koweit after a reasonable interval. I am, therefore, to suggest for Mr. Brodrick's consideration that the Gov ernment of India should be reminded of the limited character of Major Knox's mission, and should be invited to indicate a suitable moment for his temporary withdrawal.

Mi Lord, With reference to your Despatch No. 326, of the 13th September, respect ing the proposed survey operations of the Investigator, I do not think much is to be gained by abstaining from surveying the Khor Abdullah and the Bubiyan Island channel out of complacency to Turkey, while on the other hand, having in mind the disputed ownership of the island, we should, if anything, gain something by making evident to the Turks our views in regard to that question. I have had no answer as yet from the Minister for Foreign Affairs with reference to my demand for the withdrawal of the Turkish Military Station on the south-east (A1 Geit) point of Bubiyan, but, on the other hand, I have not pressed the matter very hard, as I have kept it as a reply to the represen a- tions which are likely to be made at no distant date in connection with e appointment of a British Agent and the establishment of a British Bost Omce at Koweit.

No definite reply was returned to His Excellency, and he has not since reverted to the subject. Should the question again be raised in London, nothing will be said inconsistent with the view held by His Majesty's Government in regard to the deputation of a British Agent at Koweit, of which Sir N'Connor was informed in my Despatch No. 234', of 20th August 1903, and you should bear in mind the language used in that Despatch in the event of your being questioned by the Turkish Government.

The Turkish Government had been informed that Major Knox, Assistant in the Consulate at Bushire, had been selected for the post. This arrangement appeared to them to involve an unwarrantable disturbance of the status quo.

S ir, The Turkish Ambassador made to me to-day a statement to the following effect in regard to the visit of Major Knox to Koweit ^ Eecent information received by the Imperial Government showed that Major Knox was not alone at Koweit. He had with him eight Spain's; he had taken into h:s service as Secretary a man named Abdulah ; he had entered into relations with the natives, was interfering in affairs of administration, and had hoisted the English flag over his residence. The Imperial Ottoman Government felt sure that Lord Lansdowne would not fail to see that these proceedings, which gave to Major Knox' Mission a character very different from that which it was represented to be, were in contravention of the Agreement arrived at between the two States in regard to the status quo at Koweit. His Excellency was therefore instructed to press for the immediate recall of the Agent in question. I promised His Excellency that I would at once make inquiry into the facts. I imagined that officials travelling in that part of the world usually took with them a certain number of retainers, but that I could not admit the correctness of the information which the Turkish Government had received, or announce the action which His Majesty's Government were likely to take, until I had ascertained what had really taken place.

Foreign Office to India Office. 25th November 1904. S ir, The Marquess of Lansdowne has given careful consideration to the telegram from the Viceroy of Indh of November 19th regarding Koweit enclosed in your letter of the same d ite. This telegram is an answer to a telegram from the Secretary of State for India of November llth, in which it was stated that, in view of the general situation elsewhere, His Majegtv's Government considered it desirable that Major Knox should be temporarily withdrawn from Koweit, in order not to raise a difficult question with the Turkish Government at the present moment; the Government of India was accordingly requested by Mr. Brodriek to con sider the question with a view to fixing the earliest possible date for his with- drawal. When the Viceroy's telegram of November 19th was despatched, the Government of India had not received Mr. Brodrick's communication of November llth, which gives a detailed explanation of the policy of His Majesty's Government and it is possible l.hat, had this information been before them, the view taken by the Viceroy might have been somewhat modified. But in any case Lord Lansdowne cannot think that the view taken by the Government of india is altogether well-founded. It appears indeed to be based upon a complete misapprehension of the circumstances in which His Majesty's Government gave their sanction to the deputation of Ma jar Knox to visit Koweit as an Agent of the British Government. His Majesty's Government have never agreed to the appointment of a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit. This course, which was suggested for consideration by Sir N. O'Conor in his telegram No. 112 of July 18th, 1903, and supported by the Government of India in their telegram of July 31st, was discussed at length by the two Departments in the correspondence Omitted in Foreign Office letter. in the margin. Copies of these letters were no doubt forwarded to India in the ordinary course, and the decision of His Majesty's Government is clearly and sufficiently summarised in tne following telegram, dated August 26tb, from the Secretary of State to the Government of India:— ' On the whole His Majesty's Government consider that the proposal to appoint a British officer to reside permanently at Koweit could not but be regarded as a departure, only to be justifiei by clear necessity, from the status quo which they have insisted upon so strongly in their discussions with the Turkish Government. Pro posal to take Consul at Mohammerah away from his commercial duties in Persia in order to deal with questions of an entirely different class connected with Turkish Arabia is also one to which the Foreign Office object. It is considered that the existing system, under which the ordinary channel of communication with Koweit is the Kesident in the Persian Gulf or one of his subordinates, works well on the whole. Closer touch with Koweit could, if found necessary hereafter, be gradually established by repeating at intervals temporary visits of selected officers until his residence becomes practically permanent.' . ^ obviously not be consistent with the policy thus expressed to make an immediate and permanent appointment of a British Agent to reside at Koweit, nor would it be possible to reconcile such an appointment with the assurances given to Turkey regarding the maintenance of the status quo in the Fersiau Gulf ; on the other band, the deputation of an officer to visit Koweit xx^^/r^ 0 ^ ^ me as a temporary measure has received the full approval of His Majesty s Government, and it was alwavs intended that in any communi cations which might take place with the Turkish Government the right to take this step as often as it may seem desirable to do so should be absolutely reserved.When therefore the Government nf Tn^o dnr™ i. j • .i .

' The perZfent retention of the Agent would, however, involve so serious a departure from the general line of policy laid down by His Majesty's Government that CLrd- ship is, as at present advised, unable to agree to it. f ls ^ owe 7 e ^ P re P are d to agree that no immediate steps should be taken for Major Knox s withdrawal and, having regard to the recent conduct of the Turkish Government m respect to the Aden Irade and the occupation of the island of Bubian by^Turkish troops, it seems to him that there is some advant age in allowing Major Knox to remain for the present at Koweit. He should, however, in Lord Lansdowne's opinion, certainly be withdrawn after a reasonable interval, and he might be so instructed to inform the Sheikh before his departure that be will repeat his visits, and that the date of his return will depend on the course of events. He might be authorised to add that, if during msabsenee events should occur or communications be made to the Sheikh tending to affect the Sheikh's position in regard to Turkev or any foreign Power, a message should be addressed by the Sheikh to the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf.

External. e part To T he E ight H on'ble S t . JOHN BRODEICK, Sis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, F ort W illiam, the 19th January 1905, d. sle, We have received your despatch No. 57 (Secret), dated 11th November 1904, on the subject of the posting of a Political Agent at Koweit, and in reply we have the honour to submit the following observations in explanation of the attitude which the Government of India have adopted in the matter. 2. On 31st July 1903, the Government of India, in reply to an enquiry from your predecessor, expressed an opinion in favour of the appointment of an Agent; but in view of objections raised by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, it was ultimately decided to continue the then existing practice of deputing an officer to Koweit from time to time from the Residency at Bushire. 3. In the early part of 1904, a new situation having arisen, in consequence of the armed intervention of the Turkish authorities in the struggle being carried on in Central Arabia between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud, the question of posting a British officer at Koweit was again raised, and on 24th June you sanctioned the appointment of an Agent in a telegram, m which no words were used which could be held to imply that the appointment was o y temporary. On the 28th July 1904, you ordered Captain Knox to proceed at rm™ fn TTn-irroU « n *r. cnph a Tnarmer that unnecessary attention may not be he has done or said nothing: that would convey me impicaaiuiA w umuer do j^owert is oniy — with a view to the withdrawal of Captain Knox for6. We have received this intimation with regret, since the present annears to us to be a peculiarly inopportune moment for the adoption of any measurp that may be thought to show a weakening of British interest or a surrender of British claims in any part of the Persian Gulf. You will perceive from thp correspondence which accompanies this despatch that, though the Sheikh remains at present well affected towards the British connection his attitude may, in the opinion of Major Cox, be altered, should existing condition, not be maintained in the future. Owing, apparently, to the failure of Ibn Rashid to maintain his position in Central Arabia, and possibly to the bad treatment accorded by him to his Turkish auxiliaries, the Porte seems to be seriously considering the advisability of confirming Ihn Saud in Nejd, on condition that he accepts Turkish sunre- macy. Major Cox, in his telegram of 28th December, considers that the reports of a tendency towards rapprochement are well founded, and he con siders that the Turks will, when terms are arranged, employ Saud to seducp Mubarak from his allegiance to us. Major Cox adds— 'As long as we maintain the present arrangement, I do not think we have much to fear; but if simultaneously with rapprochement we go away or partially withdraw palpable support from Koweit then the ultimate probability must be the secession of Mubarak '. ' These considerations derive additional weight from a studv of the nresent position m other parts of the Gulf. J pieseni; The recent occurrences at Bahrein show that the Ruler of that island bv no means realises the attitude which is due from him to his British protector • and even if the measures which have been suggested to induce him to listen to the representations of the Political Resident are accepted by His Maiestv's ? 0V l rnI ^ nt . and P rove successful, the impression likely to result therefrom in the Persian Gulf generally may be neutralised by anv appearance of diminution m tt)e degree of support extended by us to the Sheikh of Koweit who already suffers for his British connection at the hands of Turkish officials m the matter of his estates at Pao and its neighbourhood. K Sinc 1 e j however, a decision has been arrived at in the matter against which would no longer be becoming on our part to protest, it is our duty to take steps to obey the instructions of His Majesty's Government and to consider how the menner and date of effecting the temporary withdrawal of sots toavXitT best v rec , 0 1 nciled ™ th the exigencies of the local situation, Sheikh 6X6 S suspicion or provoking the resentment of the i The proposal which at present commends itself to us is that Captain Knox f 0 ^ C ® mfor m the Sheikh that, pending the construction and comple tion of a suitable residence for himself, he does not see his way to snendin^the health Sied fo/an^ Tf'* at .^ owcit &gt; and that he has, for reasons of March or he-Inn^ nf TrfT ' P 6 /™ 18810 ! 1 to leave temporarily at the end of Marcn or be 0 inning of April, on the understanding that he is to return when xpetT^mMa^ Cof Ed ,? r ? ^ V 0 do S0 ' 1 re P ort on th?s scheme S expected from Major Cox, who has also been asked whether anv other ground of temporary withdrawal would, in his opinion, be preferable^ and uSs reply has been rece.ved it is difficult for us to decide finally in the matter once belnfomed' an/ t ^ His Government will at about the date to Uich reS^nceVarb^n mtde above' hdraff ^ Wm ^ ^ and of yow telSram^^Lth'TW^r Conta j ned ^ paragraph 3 of your letter, instructions to Sr Cox fn retrd' to^vl? t0 ^ ^ ^ sss ts rf •» ^ ation in regard to NpiH nff * ^ 0 secl Jj e as .

Early on the mornins: of 18th November we arrived at Maskat and stayed there until the following evening. During this time official visits 'were exchanged with the Sultan, I received an address from the Indian traders in EncWe No. i. Maskat territory, and I held a Darbar on Ditto No. II. board the ' Argonaut,' followed by the investiture of the Sultan with the G.C.I. E. Copies of my speeches to the British Indian subjects and at the Darbar are included among the enclosures to this letter. It was not necessary to say in them anything beyond what has been said before; although the circumstances in which the statements and assurances were now repeated, no doubt invested them with a new and special significance His Highness the Sultan on all these occasions conducted himself with simpli.* city and dignity, his demeanour was that, of a loyal feudatory of the British Crown rather than of an independent sovereign, and it is clear that he trusts implicitly to the British Power for spport and protection. He did not plead for any further engagements, nor did he seek to extract any fresh pledge. The situation and its surroundings were evidently sufficient in his eyes to^confirm him in reliance upon our friendship, and in an attitude of deference to our wishes, which is not only of good omen for the future, but which reflects the greatest credit upon Major Cox, the Political Agent whom I appointed to Maskat in 1899, and who in little more than four years has converted the ruler from feelings of suspicion, if not of direct hostility, to those of confidence and regard. On the other hand, in proportion as the desire of the Sultan to ran^e himself, so to speak, alongside of the Indian Princes in their relations to the British Crown was made manifest, so did the incongruity of his international position become more apparent: while the contradiction between the actual state of affairs—with a ruler, a people, and a trade almost entirely dependent upon ourselves and the theoretical status, under which France, represented on 7 7 a Consul, with no subjects, and next to no trade, enjoys a treatv equality with Great Britain—was such as to emphasize the desirability of erminating with as little delay as possible a situation so anomalous and it nng it almost be said so grotesque. On the concluding afternoon of my stay at Maskat I invited His Highness the Sultan to a private interview at which I l . m . 0 . thing that was in his mind. Before conferring upon him the insignia of the G.C.LE., by order of His Majesty the King-Emperor, on the morning of the same day, I l.ad stipulated that His Highness should place himself entirely in the hands of the Government of India and should act upon tieir advice m respect of his desire to abdicate, previously reported by ™n™ 0 f U * rm ^ ^ was not mentioned during the private fnr f 1 11 .

Here I parted with feir A. Hardinge, who had shown the warmest desire to co -operate m the objects of my cruise, and who was equally vexed with myself at the contretemps that had occurred at the sole spot where it had been proposed that 1 should land upon Persian soil. Uuringour many conversations we discussed the subjects of British and Indian interests in Seistan, the Seistan boundary demarcation, the proposed removal of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk } the attitude of the Belgian Customs officers, the Husso-Belgo-Persian policy on the Baluch frontier, the extension of the Indian and Indo-European tele graphs to Seistan, the channels of correspondence between our Consul in Seistan and the British Legation at Tehran, the appointment of Pvussian telegraph -signallers in Central Persia, and the extension of Prussian tele graphs in the north, the Reglement Douanier, the recent loan to the Persian Government and the question of the Southern Customs, the maintenance of the British quarantine officers in the Gulf, the raising of Bakhtiari and Lur levies or road-guards, the location and functions of British Consular officers, whether appointed from the Levant Service or from India, in Southern Persia and the Gulf, and the political and strategical defence of the interests of Great Britain in her legitimate sphere of influence by land and by sea. The results of these discussions and the recommendations of the Government of India will in many cases form the subject of later representations to His Majesty's Government. 17. The question had been raised whether I should make an attempt to see the Sheikh of Mohammerah, As, however, I did not propose to ascend the Shat -el-Arab, as an invitation to the Sheikh to meet me elsewhere than in his own territory might, in view of his peculiar and rather delicate relations with the Persian Government, have given offence to the latter, and as Sir A. Hardinge himself intended to visit him a little later, it seemed to me that the idea had better not be pursued. The Sheikh sent me a very courteous letter by the hand of Major Burton, our Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, and to this I replied in a similar tone. 18. At Bushire my tour of the Gulf was really at an end: the squadron dispersed : and, touching, only at Jask for telegraphic messages on my return journey, the ' Hardinge ' carried me back into Indian waters. On the way I halted for a day at Pasni, a small port, with a possible future before it, on the coast of British Makran. The opportunity was taken to hold a Darbar for the Chiefs and Sardars of Western and Southern Baluchistan. Colonel Yate had come for the purpose from Quetta, and the Sardars attended in force from as far as Las Bela on the east, Kharan on the north, and the Persian border on the west, having in some cases been marching for weeks in order to be present. Xo Governor-General had ever previously visited Makran. It is a part of the Indian Empire, which has been somewhat neglected, but which, as soon as peace has been thoroughly established on the Persian frontier, will acquire some importance and admit of a not inconsiderable expansion. The Enclosure Xo. vii. speech which I made at the Larbar will be found among the enclosures. 19. On 7th December I arrived again at Karachi, after an absence of exactly three weeks. The programme had been carried out, with one excep tion, in everv particular: and the utmost good fortune had atteudec us throughout. The weather had been extraordinarily favourable : and all the officers concerned had laboured hard to make the proceedings a success, cannot, I think, be doubted that they will have left upon the rulers and peop es of the Gulf a powerful and lasting impression of the incontestable predo minance of British interests in those regions, and of the resolute m en ion 0 the British and Indian Governments to maintain them. I have the honour to be, Sie, Your most obedient, humble servant. (Signed) CL'PtZON.¥N India Office, 7th Deoember 1904. Sir, With reference to Sir E. Gorst's letter of the 17th end to T'r.

Lord Lansdowne concuis m the couise Vtliieh ivir. Secretary Brodrick proposes to pursue, as stated in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of your letter of the 7th instant viz., that if Captain Knox is pressed by Sheikh Moubarek in regard to the state of affairs in Nejd, he should repeat the warnings already given by Lord Curzon against cutanglements in the interior, and that he should further be instrucied to decline to offer any opinion as to the advice to be given by the Sheikh of Koweit to Ibn Saoud. in respect of the Turkish advances to the latter. In his Lordship's opinion it should be clearly understood tnat the interest and influence of His Majesty's Government are to he contiiied strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia, and that no measures are to be undertaken, or language used, which might appear to connect them even indirectly with the tribal warfare now in progress in the interior. As regards the suggestion that the withdrawal of Captain Knox should be conditional on the Turkish evacuation of Bubian Island, Lord Lansdowne is in entire agreement with the views conveyed in the last paragraph of your letter. His Majesty's Government have decided to reserve absolutely the right to dispatch an. agent to Koweit from time to time, at their own discretion as to the time of his visits and their duration; it is clear, therefore, that this policy must be defended and maintained on general grounds, quite apart from any specific breach of the status quo on the part of the Turkish Government, such as that under discussion, and that Captain Knox's withdrawal, whenever it takes place, must not be represented as a concession made in consideration of the action of the Turkish Government at other points, I am, &amp;&gt;c.

KOWEIT. [19th December.] CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 1. No. 1. Mr. Townley to the Marquess of Lansdowne. No. 960 (Secret). Constantinople, My Lord, 14th December 1904. On the 1st December an Imperial Irade was issued, ordering the Emir of Mecca to be instructed to contribute all necessary assistance to the vast military force that was being prepared for the purpose of destroying Mubarek-es-Sobah (the Sheikh of Koweit) and his adherents. The force alluded to was without doubt the one then under orders to march against Ibn Saud, but it is interest ing to see that at the Palace the latter is only looked upon as an adherent, whilst Mubarek-es-Sobah is regarded as the real head of the movement. I took an opportunity to ask the Grand Vizier casually, in the course of a conversation about the pardon of the Sheikh of Koweit's Basrah Agent, what was the meaning of the rumour I had received from Jeddah that a force was to be despatched against Mubarek-es-Sobah. Such action, I said, would consti tute a most serious infraction of the status quo, and might lead to most serious consequences. Eerid Pasha emphatically denied the truth of the rumour, but he did it in such a manner as to confirm my conviction that the Imperial Irade, to which I have alluded above, was couched in the terms I have reported. Subsequently, I have learned that the Wali of Basrah has reported that Mubarek-es-Sobah is pleased at the recent action taken by the Turkish author ities to assist him in ridding himself of certain brigands (here I do not follow the story), and has complained of the attitude of Major Knox, who, the Sheikh adds, behaves like a Consul, and threatens that he will close the shops if he is not allowed to open a Post Office. The Wali dwells upon the good disposition towards the Turkish Government shown by Mubarek-es-Sobah, and recommends the desirability of desisting from any expedition against him. This suggestion of the Wali has been approved by the Council of Ministers; the Sultan has sanctioned the recall of the expedition, but holds the Ministers responsible for any difficulties that may arise in consequence. This information, which I have obtained from a secret source in which I have great con adence, would appear to confirm the suspicions of the Govern ment of India, as communicated to Your Lordship by the Viceroy in his tele gram of the 19th ultimo, of which a copy accompanied your despatch to me, No. 414 of the 6th instant, that Mubarek is seeking to make terms with the Turks. As regards the suggestion contained in the Viceroy's telegram of the 26th ultimo, copy of which also accompanied Your Lordship's above-quoted despatch, that the Turkish Government might be asked to give a promise to maintain the status quo in the Nejd as a condition of Major Knox's withdrawal, I would venture to point out that it is somewhat hard to say at the present moment what is the true state of affairs in the Nejd.

Our correspondent at Muscat writes as follows:- Al -Ahrarn has informed us that the Sublime Porte has protested to the English Government ag&amp;inst the establish ment of a consulate at Koweit, and that Lord Lansdowne re plied that the establishment was a temporary one. This reply is a clear admission that the British Government has no right to establish a consulate at Koweit without the con sent of the Sublime Porte. Lord Lansdowne should be praised for making the above reply, which is contrary to the designs of the men of the forward policy. But was lord Lansdowne sincere in making the said reply? Does he know that the 6onsul has set up his flag staff in front of his residence, without the permission of His Majesty the Sultan, who is the owner of the place, and without that of Mubarak bin Sabah. who is the Governor of the place? If lord lansdowne is aware of the above circumstances then it was bad for him to have stated to the Sublime Porte different from what he knew and believed. *e have heardr% that tlie Times of India has made an attack on the Sublime Porte in the following terms - f! 0 ? Sultan you have disturbed the existing state of peace and quiet 'by sending help to Ihn-i- Rashid against ITon-i-Saood, because it is quite clear that if Ibn -i-Saood suffers defeat, then Ibn-i-Reshid will attack Ibn- i-Saood^ friend and ally, viz; Mubarak bin Sabah in Koweit'. I tell you what is right, viz; that only the English writers could say such things, because they have no fear of any one standing up before them and asking them to say who was the aggressor, whether Ibn-i-Saood or Ibn-i-Rashid. r When Ibn-i- Saood first attacked and seized Riadh by fraud, but Ibn-i- Rashid did not attempt to retake it, then was Ibn-i-Rashid the aggressor? Did he not leave to Ibn-i-Saood the whole of the Wahabi country, and withdrew to Shim^iar, Boreida and el-Kasim? Did not Ibn-i-Rashid in May last betake hiraselx to Samawa, rhich is about 650 Kilometres from Hayal. his capital, and a thoussnd Kilometres from Boreida, which his enemy took? Did not Ibn -i-Saood at that time attack Ibn -i-Jarad, an officer of Ibn-i-Bashid and killed about 600 of his men? Bid he not then attack Anaizah. the capital of el-Kasim. end take possession of it? Did he not then lay seige to Boreida and bombard its walla and breach them by means of guns which he got from his friend Mubarak of Koweit; and from whom did Mubarak get the guns? Did not the English give them to MubarakHi 7 J rnxbaxak as a present? Yes, all the abwe has been accomplish- ed 'by the endeavours of Mubarak, and the aid of the English. Mubarak even used to send provisions and other supplies to Ibn-i-Saood, because the places which were visited by Ibn-i- S &amp;ood were suT -l er ing from fan in e, and Ibn-i-Beshid had to leave them on that account and proceed to Irak to procure pasture for the herds of his animals. Had not Ibn-i-Saood large sums of money with him to distribute among the Arabs, and whence did he get the money? Was it not supplied by the Government of India? Thus His Majesty the Sultan did not send his troops to attack Ibn-i-Saood but to aid Ibn-i-Rashid, so as to enable him to oppose Ibn-i-Saood, because if this be not done the latter will collect s lakh of horsemen, who are all poor and indigent, end who will plunder Irak'. In the above language of a loyal Turk we should replJ 7 ' repelling the attacks of the said journal and of those who inspire it with such foolish end weak arguments. But we see that the British Consul is not preparing i to depart. He has now spent a full year at TCoweit, lias put up a flag staff, and established a post offfloe there. The mail steaner visits it every fortnight, Thich it did not do before. Besides this other vessels elso call there. yhe mail steaner which refused to convey sone arms from Muscat to Koweit in order to make a show of its strictness, latterlytook tro consignments of 86 and 7 eeses containing arms. Each ease contained twnety rifles and a thousand cartridges. I hsve learnt today that His Majesty the Sultan hss promised to ptudon Ibn-i-Saood and to accept his submission snd ftllsgifiiiG©# This is B't'trilDii'tGd. tjo 'the good ojCiTicBS of Jassirc bin Thsni, tlie Shaikh, of el Katr, who is now about one hundred years old, and who is in the enjoyment of his full vigour and power, being lateljr married to a young lady. It is stated about this Shaikh that on one ocession a corrupt Mutas^arrif came to el Katr and arrested his brother demanding a certain sum of r.oney for his release which the Shaikh refused to pay. On this the Mutasarrif sent a body of soldiers who surrounded the house. But the men of Jasim came out and fought with the soldiers killing about one hundred of them; they then proceeded to their barracks, and seized a number of their men, and so the Mutasarrif was obliged to set free his brother in return for his men. Ever after that Jasim has been living a quiet and undisturbed life. Lately Ibn-i-Hashid made advances of friendship to Jasin but he declined to concern himself about him. In May last Ibn-i-Rafchid heard in Irak the report o.t the seige which Ibn -i-3aood had laid to the Fort of Boreida. On this he sent a letter to His Majesty the Sultan reporting that the Wahabis had overpowered him. end that they would seizeseize Mecca and Medina. The Sublime Porte replied that orders had been sent to despatch four regiments of soldiers with a 'battery of guns from Baghdad to fight with the Wahahis. Consequently Ibn-i-Rashid was greatly elated with Joy, felt himself quite strong, and wrote to his offi cial at Boreida that he was coming with EO regiments and one hundred guns to annihilate the Wahabis, so that not a single Wahahi be left in Arabia. This letter fell into the hands of Ibn-i-Saood, who sent a copy to Mubarak bin Sebah and the original to Jasim bin Sani, who on recognising the seal of Ibn-i-Rashid. became highly enraged as he is himself a Wahabi, and sent via India a long telegram con sisting of two thousand words to His Majesty the Sultan intimating that if the Sublime Porte should aid Ibn-i-Rashid all the Wahabis, half of whom had kept aloof from Ibn-i- Saood, would at once join him in self protection. After this some messengers were also sent to Constantinople, and it appears that they have achieved some success, as may be observed from the remerks which Al Aran contains ahout the good service done to prevent blood shed anfl to serve the interests of the country#V® j fSVf would be advisable for 3-011 if possible to leave Koweit by the nail 01 oho 4uii. i r a&amp; for loiian'nerah and Ahxmz failing tiiat by 'Oiie mail of the 11th Jlay. 3 in intinatinf your departure to Shaikh Hubarak you i.ipht explain to hir. the circunistances of the attack on Lieutenant I»oriT.er by I.urs and the necessity of his takinp sick leave o rinp to the injuries he received, and of the arranBonent vrhich the ^lOvernr.ent of India have rvade by whicli you will carry on the duties of both posts during Lieutenant Lorir.er's absence, gravitating between the two posts as opportunity offers. j : p;at) er t; .at tjie sugg estions raade in ti'.e (i -ovemment of India's telegrain. poin'oi'ir to suitable perioc.s .^o.. j oiai in each place are only intended to fmmish us with an idea of what their wishes are in this connection and would be open to modification according to the exigencies of the moment. 4 During your absence Assistant Surgeon Daodiii.

My dear Ilnox, I have received your derii-official letter dated 19th June on the subject of the aspirations of a Mr, Quays to travel to Riadh. I find it difficult to reconcile your diary entry for 15th June, saying that, 'The general impression among the Arabs is that he is an English spy and that Islam is a pretence', with your action in introducing him to Sheikh lubarek and in proposing to make him the bearer of a letter, whatever be the terms, from yourself to Bin Saood. In any case, having regard to the decision recently reiterated by His .ajesty's Government and communicated to you last mail and also to the clear enunciation of Mr, llorley's personal views, to be found in the corresT)ondence with the war Office which has just teached me and of which I enclose copies for your information, I am confident that His Majesty's Govern ment would be much displeased were Fr.

If, however, the latter is willing to remain in Koweit pending reference to Government and if you are in a position to ensure, in corarunioation with Sheikh llubarek that he does not leave surreptitiously, well and good. If, on the other hand, there is any prospect of his refusing to be guided by your advice, you would be well -advised to arrange that he receives an unmstakable hint from Sheikh llubarek to leave by the next British India Steamer, and in seeing that he collies with it. I have every personal sympathy with ilr. Guays . ^-Mnn but unfortunately he 'has emoark- ehterprising aspiration, ed00167 embarked upon it at an inopportune juncture. I attach for your information a coioy of a demi- official letter which I have addressed to Sir Louie Dane on th e sub j e c t.
