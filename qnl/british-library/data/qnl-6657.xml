C. 174. PERSIA. Incidence of (1) Cost of South Persia Rifles and (2) Political Expenditure in Persia. Notes by Secretary, Financial Depart ment, and Legal Adviser, India Ofice, on Viceroy's Finance Department telegram of 8th June 1917. I. Aoik by SkCRETAm, Financial JDepartment, India Office, dated 15th September 1917. I regret the delay in replying to your reference. This has been due to the necessity for very careful examination of the questions at issue, and to the dimculty of finding time for such examination, entailing the perusal of a large mass of correspondence, in the pressure of other work. 2. The Comptroller and Auditor-General in India has challenged, as unfair to India, the arrangement come to with the Treasury more than a year ago regarding the incidence of expenditure on the South Persian Rifles and has won over the Government of India to his view. As you are aware, the treasury are not very willing to bear their share of even this arrange ment as the items of actual outlay have never been submitted to them for formal sanction. If the Comptroller-General’s view were correct it would be necessary, in respect of 1916-17 alone, to claim a further sum—accord in to the latest figures we have had from India—of 300,000Z., and in 1917 -18 the amount would presumably be much larger. Moreover the cremate questions of the incidence of the subsidies and loans given to Persia during the war and of expenditure on the Seistan Militia and Secret Service have ail been brought under review by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and lequiie to be definitely settled. It is necessary therefore to be very sure of our ground before deciding on the course to be taken. 3. To do justice to these questions, it is necessary to consider the position before the war, as between India and the Imperial Government, in regard to expenditure in Persia. Diplomatic and consular expenditure pure and simple was shared on an equal basis, in accordance with the recommenda tions of the Wei by Commission ; but this principle was in practice also applied to expenditure of various kinds intended for the furtherance of the stability of Persia, e.g., various loans of considerable sums. The cost of certain troops from India actually employed in Persia when war broke out was thus^fchared. I he question whether expenditure not definitely coming under the head of “ diplomatic and consular ” is •strictly governed bv the Wei by Report was raised by Mr. Newmarch in a Note of 10th June 1916 in connection with a proposed Anglo-Russian loan of 480,000Z. a year. Sir Arthur Hirtzel considered that, “ whatever the original intention, we are too “ f ar committed by our action in the past to press on the Treasury with any “ h°pe of success the narrower view of our commitments in Persia ” ; he added that since the war we had shared the cost of numerous special advances, subsidies, &amp;c. Sir Thomas Holderness thought it to be a still unsettled question how far Indian revenues should, as a permanent anangement, shaie equally with the Ireasury expenditure of every kind inclined liy His Majesty s Government in Persia. He referred to Lord2 Morley s strong views in the contrary sense, but considered that while the war is on India is vitally interested in keeping Persia quiet and maintaining an Anglophile Government, and that acceptance of the half-and-half rule in the case then under discussion and in similar future cases would be justified. Mr. Chamberlain did not share Sir Thomas’s reservation. “The “ true and the only ground,” he said, “for such subsidies, and one which is “ quite conclusive in the present case, is that it is of primary importance to “ India that Persia should be sufficiently well governed to prevent her from “ becoming a danger to India through Afghanistan. .... But if “ India be so deeply concerned in Persian politics in a crisis, it cannot wash “ qs hands of Persian charges the moment the crisis is passed. Were it not “ for India, we should not tb-day have a man in Persia or up the Gulf, and “ India is fortunate in her bargain.” 4. Such was the position when war broke out. During the war large sums of money have been spent in Persia on (1) Ope rations of Indian Troops. (2) Subsidies and Loans. (3) Secret Service. (4) Seistan Levies. (5) South Persia Rifles. 5. As regards expenditure on the first of these categories, we obtained the agreement of the Treasury to depart from the pre-war division of cost, and to charge—as the Comptroller and Auditor-General thinks we ought to do in the case of the expenditure of the remaining categories—the whole of the extraordinary outlay to the Imperial Government. Our action was influenced by the fact that the cost of the Indian Expeditionary Forces in various parts of the world is being shared on the basis of the Parliamentary Resolutions, the ordinary outlay being borne by India, the extraordinary by His Majesty’s Government. fl. The considerations which impelled us to preserve the half-and-half division in the case of expenditure under category 2 [Subsidies and Loans] have been set forth above in recording the discussion raised by Mr. Newmarch. 7. We have proposed to the Foreign Office that outlay on category 3 [Secret Se'rvice] should be divided according to the half-and-half rule, but the matter has not yet been settled. 8. As regards category 4 [Seistan Ijevij Corps], I expressed the opinion in a note of 7th November 1916 that if the Seistan Levies formed a component part of the troops in Seistan, and were not a body formed independently and leading a separate existence, the Parliamentary Resolutions might properly be applied to them. A proposal to this effect was put to the Government of India in our telegram of 16th November ; it is this telegram which has elicited the warm approval of the Government of India and the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and has caused the latter to suggest that, for the reasons given in their telegram un,der consideration, the expenditure under categories 2, 3 and 5 should be divided in the same way. I venture to differ for the following reasons :— 9. Subsidies and Loans. —1 share the view' expressed by Mr. Chamberlain (see paragraph 3). See also concluding paragraphs of what I say below regarding South Persia Rifles. 10. Secret Service.—Jn so far as expenditure under this head is intimately connected with the military operations, its incidence ought to follow that of the cost of those operations. The Government of India recognises this y\fr. Grant s letter of 19th November 191 o', Pol. 4586/15]. Otherwise, for ' the reasons given in the notes evoked by Mr. Newmarch’s question, I think that the half-and-half principle should clearly be followed.11. bouili 1 nsia Itijlas. Hie Comptroller and Auditor-General quotes rertain telegrams in March J9JG as showing the immediate object of Sir Percy Sykes’s Mission and the Force raised by him locally. These telegrams were contemporaneous with our proposal to the Foreign Office as to the incidence of cost ol the lorce, so that Sir Richard Gamble is not drawing oui attention to anything which could have eluded our observation at the time when that proposal w T as made. But the telegrams he cites do not really show the object or character of the South Persia Rifles. For facility of examination 1 quote the passages to which he appears to refer :— (1) Telegram from Secrelartj of State to Viceroij, '2nd March 1916. Sykes’s Mission. In view 7 of differences of opinion between your Government and Minister at Tehran as to what his primary object should be, War Committee have decided that he should iii first instance discuss situation fully with Kawam • • • • Please inform Sykes of character of proposals suggested by Chief of Imperial General Staff [see my telegram (Military) ISIo. 3307 of to-day] and say that desire of His Majesty’s Govern ment is to lend all possible support to enable Kawam to recover Shiraz and clear Germans out of Pars. To that end they are prepared to supply him with arms, ammunition and mone} 7 , and, , r . c r further, to send to Bunder . Abbas r orce 1 described in my telegram 3291 of 12th February, but only if Sykes considers its presence there desirable for Kawam’s support For operations inland His Majesty’s Government will lend a.few British officers, to recruit locally under Kawam’s authority such force as it may be possible to arm His Majesty’s Government will consider any proposals which Sykes may wish to suggest after consultation with Kawam, on understanding that we cannot send regimental troops inland. Sykes should report with least possible delay. “ War Committee think German activity can be most effectively met by counter-activity of similar kind. Apart, therefore, from above operations, which are dependent on nature of Sykes’s report, they wish recruitment of Irregular Force in- Seistan proceeded with at once. They consider that such force, led by active and enter prising officers, and stiffened by cavalry now there, could take offensive in detachments and hunt down German parties. 44 Please suggest names of officers and I will ask \Y ar Office for release of any under them. Could not employes of Indo-European Telegraph Department and Imperial Bank be used tor this purpose, and younger civil political officers with some military experience? . . It will be seen that this telegram deals with four forces,— (i) The Kawam’s men. (ii) The Indian troops proposed to be sent from Egypt for Bunder Abbas. (iii) Local force proposed to be recruited under Kawam’s authority. (iv) Irregular Force in Seistan. No reference is made to the South Persia Military Police. (2) Telegram from Secretary oj State to 1 iceroy, 2\st March 1916. “ My telegram 2nd March. Persia. 1 shall be glad to learn Sykes’s views as to requirements and possibilities at Bunder Abbas, and also what action has been taken, or is proposed, on second and third para- Such M S.P.M.P. would become. graphs0 { uiy telegram. It * will be borne in mind that what War Committee desire now is not a highly-trained force for eventual restoration of oidei, but earliest possible action against German parties and rebels.“Are you satisfied as to adequacy of arrangements in Seistan ? C'/. telegram from Officer Commanding, 454, of 4th February.” The portions of the telegram of 2nd March to which this telegram relates, deal only with the recruitment of the irregular Force [in Seistan]. (,‘&gt;) Concluding portion of Viceroy's telegram of 10th March ]910,434 74.S. “ We are arranging to send as soon as possible 4,000 old serviceable rifles, and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition, to be delivered bv Sykes to Kawam’s representative. In circumstances explained, it appears undesirable to press Kawam to await Sykes’s arrival, or to press him further to accept assistance of British officers at this stage, lie is evidently averse to presence of British officers with his Force and he must be best judge of situation, although there is doubtless considerable force in arguments put forward in Minister at Tehran’s telegram Xo. 33, Oth March, to London Foreign Office. We think, therefore, that Sykes should simply go to Bunder Abbas and begin to raise Military Police Force, which, as soon as sufficiently trained, could either co-operate with Kawam on Fars side, or advance on Kerman with a view to ousting Germans from there, and eventually linking up with Seistan Forces. Sykes agrees that location of the Force mentioned in your telegram of 22nd instant [3294] at Bunder Abbas would serve no useful purpose at present, but only tend to act as irritant, and imperil the success of his undertaking.” [This telegram does definitely refer to South Persia Military Police, and proposes for them a quasi-military character. 1 refer further 'to this point below.] (4) Telegram from Secretary of Slate to Viceroy, ]lth March 1910. foreign Secret. \ oui telegram dated 10th March. Kawam. I agree. I lease telegraph as soon as possible Cox’s proposals regarding military operations at Bushire with your views.” 12. Thus, of these four telegrams, No. 3 is the only one that definitely says anything about the South Persia Militarv Police. Surely it is more correct when considering the objects of that Force, to refer to the various other telegrams m which they were more definitely discussed and settled. 1 again quote :— (a) Telegram from Mr. Marling, Oth January 191G. ” 20. Persian Government are preparing scheme for augmenting Cossack Brigade to 10,000 men They would lie aimed with „ . nffes taken from gendarmerie, and paid for out of Moratorium. Itiis project is to be mcluded among terms of the general agreement between 1 ersia and the two Powers, and Persian Government hope t int under it provision will be made to finance this Force on a permanent basis. “ r ha '' e in,iniated . t0 , Arslan Government that while His Majesty’s Go\.aliment might agree to creation of such a Force to enable the lersian Government to assist Russian troops in dealing with CMsting situation, they would scarcely relish its employment in the h a ,] wonhl certa'nly never admit that after war the only Thev wo ,1 I” 5 ? • Sh i° U , d be commanded by Russian trained officers. m ntZ oXr am I! ^' a T 1 t! f any Force t,lat ma y be required to — lor^mlheSouU,,^ British interests are so great, should be similarly under British influence ”(b) From Mr. Marting, 12th January 191G. “My telegram No. 20. Augmentation of Cossack Brigade In the South, however, there is no force competent to restore and maintain order, and I scarcely suppose His Majesty’s Govern ment will be disposed to send thither for the purpose remnant of Gendarmes now in Tehran under Major Mystrom, and supposed to be loyal ; it is an experiment which I should hesitate to recommend even as a temporary measure. ’* It is clear, however, that our interests demand that some provision should be made for dealing with South Persia, and 1 suggest that . • . . we should inform Persian Government that, for the maintenance of order in Southern Persia, where we have pre dominating interests, we shall demand formation of corps under British officers or instructors as soon as we find it convenient to do so ” (c) From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 11th January 1910. “ . . . . Marling’s telegrams 20 and ol. Cossack Brigade. Please telegraph your views with least possible delay. We realise difficulties, but both for restoration of order and to prevent dis appearance of British influence outside Tehran, similar arrange ments under British officers, if practicable, would be desirable.” (d) From Viceroy to Secretary of State, 19th January 1916. “ . . . . Your telegram of 14th instant. Persia. Cossack Brigade. We entirely agree as to desirability of maintaining visible sign of British influence outside Russian sphere, and have always advocated raising of a force under British officers for that purpose. We think Colonel Sir P. Sykes, who is obviously best qualified, might be appointed at once to organise and command a force of Military Police in Seistun, using the Hazaras, who have already been recruited, as a nucleus, and increasing their number by local recruitment Such a force, while extremely useful in the present juncture in Seistan, might gradually extend its sphere to Kerman, where further enlistment might be made, eventually linking up with Bunder Abbas ” (e) From Government of India to Sir Percy Cox, 17th February 1910. “ 348 D.S Sykes’s deputation has for its primary object the raising of a.force of Military Police in Southern Persia in order to maintain visible signs of our influence, and eventually, by expanding force to Kerman and over Southern Persia generally and linking up with nucleus already existing in Seistan, to provide machine for restoration of order.” These telegrams show that the increase of the Cossack Brigade, and the desirability of balancing this addition to Russian influence in the North, played a very important part in the institution of the South Persia Military Police ; but no reference is made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General to this aspect of the matter. Telegram (d) suggests that Sir Percy Sykes should begin operations in Seistan and work westwards to Bunder Abbas; but as events turned out he began recruitment in Bunder Abbas and the formation of a force in Seistan was dealt with by other officers and not by him. (f) From Mr. Marling, 23/*J February 1916. “112 In my view our immediate mark should be to support Kawam, and for this purpose I consider Sykes should get into touch with Kawam as soon as possible, and wherever most convenient, and take with him men, arms.ammunition Formation importance. and money, and if possible a few small guns . . . . of Military Police appears to me to be of secondary It must necessarily take too long to be of any immediate use This was the course actually taken. Money, ammunition, rifles and wuiis were supplied to Kawam. But the .mlitary operations proper as I Understand the position, were over before the South Persia Military Police mte si n„e. This is shown by the following telegrams l (g) From Sir V. Sykes to Government of India, ( Mh April 1916. “ Total collapse of Germans and rebels will presumably render further support to Kawam unnecessary. I suggest therefore that 1 should march police recruits to Kerman and organise force there. Request 1 mav be mven escort similar to that asked for in my telegram 30 C dated 6th April, and strongly recommended by Minister at Tehran in his telegram 46 F, dated 8th April. It is most desirable to avoid risk and be independent of recruits with only few weeks’ training, unfit to defend arms and ammunition. I have already recruited 300 men. ’ What active support Sir P. Sykes hoped to be able to give Kawam was apparently intended to come from an escort of Indian tioops, lor the Government of India, in sending the above telegram on, said “ Telegram “ 12th April 1916. We agree that Sykes should move forward as soon “as possible, and for this purpose we have asked General Officer Com- “ manding, Force 1), to despatch if possible at once to^ Bunder Abbas one “Squadron Cavalry, one Section Mountain Guns, two Companies Infantry, “one of which will replace present detachment Ironi Maskat. Whether “ Sykes should move to join Kawam. or barman 1‘aima, oi proceed to “ Kerman, must depend on developments ol Persian situation. (h) From Deputy Political Resident in Persian Gulf to Government of India, 1 0th April 1916. u ... . Following news received from variety of sources appears to confirm news that Shiraz has been occupied on behalf of Soulet and Kawam.” 13. It was at this period that we asked the Treasury, and they agreed, to pay half the cost of the South Persia Military Police. Our action seems to me to have been very appropriate. 14. If this view be confirmed, as 1 imagine it will be, by the Secretary of State in Council, the further question remains, whether the character of the operations in which the South Persia Military Police (or South Persia Rifles) have been engaged since April 1916, and the nature of its organisation, have been such as to render the bargain we then made with the Treasury an illegal or unfair one, as the Comptroller and Auditor-General suggests. On the information before me in these files I personally do not think so. 15. The Government of India say in their present telegram that such local troops as Sir Percy Sykes was able to raise “were employed during “ the past year mainly in connection with military operations, and that our “ connection with force has been transferred on our side to Commander-in- “ Chief and to Army Department.” They also point to the present military organisation of the Force. The question of the extent to which the operations of the Force have been “military operations” in any of the accepted senses of the term is, I think, very arguable. The “ military operations” for dealing with the German parties and the Gendarmerie rebellion were apparently carried out, as we have seen, by the forces under Kawam and Soulet, by the Seistan Field Force (including the irregular levies), and (possibly) by some of the Indian troops landed at Bunder Abbas ; not by the South Persia Military Police. So far as the South Persia Rifles4 have been actively employed, their functions, I presume, have consisted- no doubt in connection with military forces—in hunting down raiding parties let loose by the general state of lawlessness in South Persia, a condition of things aggravated, no doubt, by the war, and fostered by German intrigue. What they have been doing may, correctly I think, be described as of the nature of police duties in a tame of war and unrest] cf. the Government of India’s own telegram of* 7th August 1910, where they say that the functions of the Force will be “ mainly those of police or constabulary. The fact that the Force has a military organisation does not seem to affect this. So has the Burma Military Police. Nor does it seem specially relevant to the point at issue, that its control has been transferred to the Commander-in-Chief. This is only natural, as the South Persia Hi flee have to work in along with the purely military forces he is administering. 10. If the operations of the South Persia Rilles are not “military operations,” Section ““ of the Government of India Act does not seem to apply. Moreover, that section relates to military operations carried on by “ His Majesty’s Forces charged upon ” the revenues of India, a phrase which does not seem to cover a local force raised in a country outside India. 17. If Section 22 of the Act does not apply, the Parliamentary Resolu tions have no relevance, and the one question to be considered from the point of view of the Act is whether the expenditure may be regarded as expenditure “for the purposes of the government of India alone” (Section 20 (1) of the Act). The question at issue here is the same as in the case of the loans and subsidies given to Persia both before and since the beginning of the war. It will be seen that the Comptroller and Auditor- General considers the true nature of the expenditure incurred in connection with the South Persia Rifles is that of a subsidy to the Persian Government, in pursuance of our policy for the successful conduct of die war against Germany and Turkey, and the Government of India do not fail to see that his objection applies equally to all the so-called political expenditure which is being incurred by the Imperial Government or by us in Persia in connection with the war. 18. In view of this challenge as to the legality, as well as iairness to India, of our contributions towards these subsidies and loans, as also towards the expenditure of the South Persia Rifles, it would lie as veil to ask the opinion of the Legal Adviser. Summary. Put briefly, my views on the questions dealt with in this impoitant telegram are as follows :— 1, SeintanLevins.—The whole of the expenditure is chargeable to Imperial revenues for the reasons given in our telegram o . t r . orem jr i and the Government of India’s present reply, subject to am cur its ' ,l . K ordinary cost of any officers or troops of the Indian Ami} cm to it wes. If vou concur, you will no doubt have a draft letter prepare o t le Office, asking them to put the matter to the I reasury with a view to the necessary instructions being given to the W ar * Ihce , a r op\ o re e . might at the same time be forwarded to that Department. 2. South Persia Rifles.—My view is that, at the outset the arrangement as to incidence which we made with the ireasuij was &gt;o r an “ and legal, and that nothing that has happened smce-so far as the papets before me indicate—has altered the position. If this uew be atcepted, a suitable reply to the Government of India will piesuma ) &gt;' 1- &lt;1 your Department. 1 suggest, however, that the opinion of the I.egal Adviser he taken in regard to these payments, and those umh o ur below.A very practical point is the necessity of persuading the Treasury to repay us one-hall of the expenditure actually incurred on the South Persia Rifles. Have you yet received from the Government of India a reasoned statement of that expenditure? As matters stand the Treasury profess themselves unwilling to pay because their sanction to the various items of expenditure was not obtained. I presume that they will not maintain this attitude if satisfactory details of the scheme are once before them. It will be noted that the Government of India have stated that the purely military expenditure mixed up with Sir Percy Sykes’s expenditure is being separately charged to the Imperial Government in the War Accounts. 3. Secret Service Money, in so jar as not required for Military Pur poses ,—The half-and-half principle seems legal and appropriate. The Government of India might he asked to submit their amended statement as soon as possible. It is not clear whether the objections made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General cover these payments. Perhaps not. 4. Subsidies and Loans during present War .—The equal division seems to me reasonable and legal, but here again the opinion of the Legal Adviser might be taken. W. Ro HINSON. 15th September 1917. II. Note ry Legal Adviser, India Office, dated 4th October 1917. 1. The question at issue with the Government of India seems rather to be one of fact than of law, because it raises the point whether certain expenditure--^., in connection with the South Persia Rifles, and the eisian subsidies and loans lull within the operation of the Parliamentary Resolutions, and this point depends upon the nature of the expenditure whether it is to be regarded as civil expenditure incurred for the purposes of the eventual good government of India, or whether it is in its essence military expenditure incurred for the purpose of military operations carried on .beyond the external frontiers of His Majesty’s possessions. 2. 1 he point last mentioned is really a question of fact, upon which I am nardly competent to express an opinion. 1 may say, however, that so far as can jui ge t le financial Secretary has succeeded in making out his case as regards the item of the South Persia Rifles. The expenditure under this ic.id does not seem to me to have been incurred for a military purpose. 3 If the same can be said as to the matter of the subsidies and loans, then I agree with his conclusion that the expenditure on this head also m~ m ,’ e „r Cgar( ! e, f a T C r Vl1 cx I jeudlture undertaken for the purposes of the good government of India. bofhYLTfni] iol T ,f tl thes 'i fact&gt; ' ar * conceded that the expenditure under India Act bn ’ a s l‘ r ‘ ‘ p, ; r '; le '' of Section 22 of the Government of in iia Act, but under Section JO of that Act 4th October 1917.

Specifically, the file is concerned with how such costs should be shared between the Government of India and the Treasury.The report is mostly comprised of a note by William Robinson, Secretary to the Financial Department of the India Office, which is dated 15 September 1917 and written in response to the Viceroy's Financial Department's telegram of 8 June 1917. Robinson's note is followed by a shorter note by Sir Stephen George Sale, Legal Adviser, India Office, dated 4 October 1917.Robinson's note responds to assertions made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in India [Sir Reginald Arthur Gamble] that the existing arrangement between the Government of India and the Treasury in relation to the incidence of expenditure on the South Persia Rifles (also referred to as the South Persian Rifles in this file) is unfair to the Government of India.Robinson summarises the existing arrangement, which is based on the understanding that diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia should be shared equally between the British Indian and Imperial Governments. Robinson goes on to recount that this arrangement has in practice been applied to various other kinds of expenditure, including the costs of the South Persia Rifles and the allocation of subsidies and loans to the Persian Government. Robinson concludes that the half-and-half principle, as applied both to the costs of the South Persia Rifles and to the subsidies and loans, is both reasonable and legal. In his note, Sale opines that if Robinson is correct in concluding that neither case should be classified as military expenditure then both should be regarded as civil expenditure undertaken for the purposes of the good government of India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Financial Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Legal Adviser and Solicitor to the Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Auditor-General</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00016b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
