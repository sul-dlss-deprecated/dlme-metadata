A large part of the correspondence discusses the drafting and redrafting of a Foreign Office memorandum of instructions, which is intended to revise existing Foreign Office instructions regarding the channels of communication used by British authorities and neighbouring countries to conduct relations with Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] and the Hejaz-Nejd Government. Also discussed are communication arrangements for correspondence not only between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (based at Bushire), the Political Agent at Kuwait, and the Political Agent and Consul at Jeddah, but also between the Political Resident, the Government of India, and the India Office.Most of the correspondence is between officials of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department. Other correspondents include the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Hugh Vincent Biscoe) and the High Commissioner for Iraq (Sir Francis Henry Humphrys).Draft copies of the memorandum (to which further revisions are made following the creation of a British Legation at Jeddah) are included with the correspondence.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Communication</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000287#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
