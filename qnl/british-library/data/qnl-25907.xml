THE P0REK2T OFFICE DIR ECTIVE NO . -61 OF 3th JUNE, 19L7. 1. Guidance on the plan for India has been given £0%- In Intel No. 19 of 2nd June. In treating constitutional 'developmentsTTtHin the Snpire generally, It should be emphasised that.these are the results of our long-term policy, which has been that dependencies should develop gradually towards self-government, and not the. result of pur present economic and manpower difficulties. The addition of two Asiatic Dominions to the Commonwealth should-be welcomed and publicity given to the satisfaction expressed by all the Dominions.f - 2 - 2 # . Statements'by Gandhi if unfavourable to Dominion status and Pakistan should not be taken as representative of opinion among political leaders in Congress* However, since he is regarded by Indians as a saint, any attempt to comment on his statements might do harm, and therefore, as little attention's possible should be drawn to them. Leave all comment to the Indians themselves. Speculation on the division of the Indian Lrmy should be avoided. 3. Although .the general grounds on.:which we claim that our sterling balances in foreign countries should be scaled down are well-known and may be repeated, comment on the forthcoming negotiations with India would be out of place and any publicity might provoke unfavourable reactions among Indian opinion. k. Burma . Avoid speculation on possible influence of the India plan on the constitutional development of Burma. The Anti Fascist Peoples Freedom League have already drafted a strongly republican constitution and further developments will follow the meeting of the Constituent Assembly on June 10th. 3. Nepal : The position of Nepal as an independent state will not be affected by the new constitutional arrangements: in India and Burma. Agreement has been reached with Nepal that Gurkhas may be recruited both for the Indian and British Armies subject to the grant of transit rites by the Indian Government. The United States and Nepal have agreed to exchange diplomatic representatives. 6. The failure of the Chinese to lift rice allocated to them from Burma and elsewhere should be noted without comment, 7. China: There are indications that Chinese Communist propagandists may try to persuade us to^ intervene in China by exerting pressure on the Chinese Government to bring about an early settlement. The Secretary of State has made it clear that the British Government regard the civil war in China as an internal affair.in which we cannot intervene. While sympathising with the sufferings of all Chinese people in the civil war, avoid taking sides in the political dispute between the Government and the Communists. 8. Refrain from comment on the conference of the Dominions on the Japanese Peace Treaties, until an /officialOUTWARD TELEGRAM 0 *3- %4 ■&gt;.

This should be welcomed, .Any. action by Korean politicians leading to non-co-operation with the Commission should be deplored 0 Reports of a statement by General Hodge that the Soviet policy was to make Korea a Communist sattelite should be ignored. For your own information this statement was made some months ago before the House Appropriations Committee in February 1917 and is therefore out of its context* 10. Siam: The composition of the new Siamese Government is welcomed. For your own information, there is little hope that legal rice exports will be greatly increased, since it is impossible to prevent smuggling. In comments we should continue to support the Government in its efforts to meet T.E.F.C. allocations in full* 11. Philippines; Publicise the visit of the Vice-President of the Philippines to London, His object is to discuss the establishment of a Legation in London and other matters of common interest. No mention should be made of reported signature of- an Anglo-Philippine treaty 0 12. Netherlands Hast T ndies: Dutch proposals appear to us to be reasonable and it may be suggested that it would be in the interests of the whole world if the Indonesians accepted them. Negotiations are at a delicate stage and the impression must not be given that we are ganging up with the Dutch. 13. I,S,F,Chj The decision of the general council of the I.E.F.C, to continue to operate until June 1978 at latest is to be welcomed. Now that it has decided to hold a food conference in Europe in the near future, we shall give it our support, [For Singapore only] Please pass to Governor of Singapore and Governor of Malayan Union and by bag to Governor of Kong Kong and to Batavia, and to Governor of Sarawak and Acting Governor of North Borneo.

We are aware that, except when they are ordinary repeated telegrams e.g. “addressed Tehran repeated Kabul 1 ’, telegrams to Kabul and Nepal require authorisation in External Department before issue. This procedure was followed in the case of telegram No. 54 below, but your authority was indicated on the covering slip which, normall y, as Miss Platt says, is returned to the Foreign Office. As some trouble may jjo.wkll.ijfcff- arise as a result of the absence from the draft of the External Department’s approval, I suggest that this should be indicated on the draft itself and not on any form which merely transmits it from the originating Office.' It would be safer i:l use were made of the official draft telegram form.
