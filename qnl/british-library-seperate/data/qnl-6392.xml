The file begins with her first and successful application in 1934, for help towards the upkeep of her younger son in his final year of officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. The file ends with her unsuccessful applications in 1935 and 1938 for the grant of a Government of India pension in her old age. The correspondence contains numerous letters written by Mrs Howson after her return to England in 1933, which are addressed mainly to the India Office in London. The file also contains two private letters of support for her hardship case, from Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes and Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Frederick O’Connor respectively, both retired, to the Government of India in 1935.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Margaret Howson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Bandar Abbas</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Molesworth Sykes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight William Frederick Travers O'Connor</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bandar Abbas</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Grants</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pensions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00017f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00017f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00017f#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00017f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
