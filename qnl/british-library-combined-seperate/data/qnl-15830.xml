                           thawb, white trousers, a white turban and sandals. The straps of what may be a small bag are slung over his left shoulder.The man is photographed in a courtyard-like space with plants – some in wide wooden pots – foliage and a window, fronted by bars, visible in the background.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XXIVPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Süssigkeitskrämer (Djiddah).’A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower right corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000036#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
