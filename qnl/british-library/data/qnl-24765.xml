Tehran, June 9, 1909, 11'40 a.m. YOUR telegram No. 274 [of 3rd June: Seistan consulate defence works], I see no reason to single out Seistan consulate for defence works. Danger of any organised attack on any consulate [ ? ] in Persia such as contemplated by Kennion is remote, and more so at Seistan than at several others.

(Repeated to Tehran.) T?. — Operations for season's arms traffic have been commenced by Afghan aravans, and present activity will probably be stimidated by anticipation of uture restrictions as result of Arms Conference. Successful results are despaired of by local authorities with totally inadequate forces at our ■isposal, and they advocate either effective naval blockade or military cordon long coast of Mekran, or both measures together. Use of troops on Persian erritory, or any great naval activity in and near Gulf, are open to strong bjections on political and financial grounds. On the other hand, inaction, ven if our position towards Persian Government and our case at Arms Conference were not prejudiced thereby, would certainly be misunderstood in Afghanistan, and probably in Persia. Some information has reached us that rices of arms have risen at coast, in consequence of naval activity and ncreased risk last year. Prices in Afghanistan and along the frontier have imultaneously been lowered by increase in supply. The trade will become ess profitable the more it is harried. Greater difficulties, moreover, will be rented later on by inaction now. Conclusion ire have arrived at is that we horld continue naval activity with available force, although, owing to with- Irawal of “ Lapwing ” to re-fit, until early in March only two vessels will be ’Vailable for all purposes in the Gulf, whereas, for effective action, Admiral onsiders seven would be necessary. In opinion of Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan, if we interfere with Afghans, there will be danger of attack 'port telegraph employes on Central line, and he therefore suggests that fdinary garrison should be temporarily retained at Rabat, and that staff tationed between Robot and Bam should be withdrawal to one or other of those laces. Our opinion is decidedly against withdrawal of telegraph staff, and ve urge that measures to protect them against all risk should be taken by ersian Government. Force now at Rabat should be temporarily retained ¥ re ; ^ e infer from Resident, Persian Gulf, that there is no risk to tele- faith staffs along the coast with operations on scale contemplated. Staff has a uard of 30 Mekran levies, reinforcement of which can, if necessary, be rranged. xFrom Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, i)tli January 1909. Foreign Secret.

To The Right Hon'ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 22nd October 1908, My Lord, In Your Lordship’s telegram of the 30th March last, on the subject of the reinforcement of the Robat post by 500 men as a precautionary measure in connection with the illicit traffic in arms from the Persian Gulf littoral, you suggested that, after the trouble was over,^ the question of the further maintenance of the Pvobat post should be considered. We now have the honour to forward a copy of correspondence on the subject, as noted in the enclosed list. 2. The special reinforcement of 500 men which was sent to protect the Robat post in April last has already been withdrawn, and the question now to be decided is whether it is still necessary to retain the double company of Native Infantry, which was posted to Robat in 1906. This force, as Your Lordship is aware, was originally despatched as an escort to a reserv e of arms and ammunition, which was required for the British Consulates at Meshed and Seistan, and with the object of affording protection to British subjects, should such be necessary. It has since been retained at Robat in consequence of disturbances in Seistan and other events, which seemed to render it desirable to have a British force located on the Perso-Baluch border. the 3. The question of its withdrawal has now been discussed with our Political Officers in Baluchistan and Seistan, whose opinions* are given in It will be observed that, while Major Kennionf deprecates the withdrawal in the present state of Persian politics, Sir H. McMahont sees no objection to it, jrovided that certain arrangements are made for the accommodation of any ■orce which it may be necessary to send to the Persian borders in future and ’or improving the conditions on the trade route. These arrangements and Major Kennion’s scheme§ for the defence § Enclosure No. 4. of t | ie geistan , Consulate are under separate consideration, and our orders will be reported to you in due course. Meanwhile, we do not consider it necessary to delay our decision on the question of the retention of the troops at Robat. 4. The main factor to be considered is the safety of the Seistan Consulate. On this point, while attaching due weight to the considerations mentioned by * Enclosures Nos. 2 and 3. attached correspondence. f Enclosure No. 3.

I think Robat escort might well he withdrawn as far as concerns safety of British subjects in case of purely local disturbances, provided that steps bad been taken to improve to furthest possible capacity the Seistan Consulate and Birjand Agency. But I do not think the suggested change at present advisable considering the critical state of Persia as a whole, the possibility of a general rising and the valuable political effect the presence of troops at Bobat undoubtedly has. The steps alluded to above would be Consulate defence scheme as submitted to the Government of India, the augmentation of escort to 45 to provide for Birjand, and the increase of the Chageh Levies to thirty (half could be dismounted). I would also advise number of Chageh Levies available for reinforcements being raised to one hundred, if proposed withdrawal is carried out. Repeated as No. 66 to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, Consul- General, Meshed, and Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan. No. 784-B., dated Quetta, the 16th November 1907. From—The General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Division, To—The Quarter Master General in India. M ith reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 716-B., dated 5th November IbC‘7, I have the honour to request that the question of the future retention of the Robat Escort furnished from this Division may be referred to the Poreign Department for consideration and favour of early decision. J 2. The detachment originally proceeded to Robat as an escort to arms and ammunition for consulates at Seistan and Meshed, and on arrival at Robat was temporarily retained on account of local and frontier disturbances. 3. A detachment has now been furnished at Robat since April 1906, the disturbed state of the coutry being given as a reason for their retention when ever the question of vvithdraw^al has been put forward ; and as from information lately received from the Political authorities there seems to be no immediate prospect of any change in the condition obtaining in that district, it would appear that the withdrawal of the troops is improbable for some time. 4. The nature of the climate, scarcity and indifferent quality of drinking water, and scarcity of local supplies, all combine to make service at this out post very detrimental to the health of the troops employed there. o. I attach a statement showing the general health of the detachment since first arrival at Robat from which it will be seen, that at the end of six months, the percentage of sick becomes permanently large. 6. I consider that if it is probable that this detachment will be required to remain at Robat ior any further considerable period, i.e., not less than 12 months, that it should be placed on the same category (for relief purposes only) as all detachments furnished from this Division, and its regular relief at intervals of six months be sanctioned. 7. This will mean a recurring annual charge of Rs. 9,400, but I consider that this expense is well worth incurring considering the gain in efficiency that Foreign Department.1 xVm frnn-nc; heine returned to Quetta before they become in- will accrue by tbe troop g cage of the detachment 128th Pioneers, capacitated for active ser .^^ ^ deathg occurred on the return march and the percentage of deaths a. » , on arr i va i a t Quetta.

(Confidential), dated Seistan, the 22nd May 1908. 'From— Major R. L. Kennion, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to address you on the subject of a scheme of defence for this Consulate. 2. Although at the present time it is difficult to imagine circumstances arising, involving the Consulate in a defence against an organised attack, yet the hold of the Central Government over the country is very insecure and the whole future of the country doubtful : so much so, that it seems to me we should belprepared for eventualities that are not at first sight at all likely. If, for instance, Hussia were constrained to send troops into Persia, a contingency which cannot be considered very remote, it is conceivable that a wave of Anti- European fanaticism might pass over the country in which Seistan and the Kainat would be affected. In these circumstances, it is possible that Europeans in Seistan might have to defend themselves against Persian sarbazes, who at a time like that postulated would be under no control, as well as against a local mob. In view of the possibility of such a contingency, remote though it may he, I think the precaution of making the defence of the Consulate possible should not be omitted. 3. I submit herewith a copy of a scheme worked out by Lieutenant Molesworth, R. £., with the assistance and advice of Captain Gibbon (Intel ligence Branch) when these two officers were recently in Seistan. It will be | seen that its chief feature is the erection of bastions at certain points in the outer wall. These bastions could not of course be built without attracting a good deal of attention ; but, as pointed out by Lieutenant Molesworth,° it could be explained that they were for ornamental purposes. In any case perhaps the right of the Persian Government to make objections to the style 5 of any building erected within the Consulate enclosure would not be admitted. \ I do not anticipate that the erection of these bastions would at the present time arouse locally any serious popular feeling against the Consulate.

General Description. —The Consulate consists of an irregular poly gonal figure, about 400 yards long by 300 yards wide. It is everywhere enclosed by a kutcha brick wall about 8' high by 2' thick. In addition to the Consulate itself, this enclosure contains the escort lines, hospital, office and various subsidiary buildings. 2. Nature of Attack. —The nature of the attack is very difficult to state. It is most probable that it will be in the nature of a sudden rush, which if repulsed may lead to nothing; and it is fairly certain that it will be intermittent; also that anything which may be called a success by the attacking force is likely to attract greater numbers. The assailants will probably be armed with country made rifles with possibly a few Martini or similar weapons ; but it is extremely unlikely that they will possess any artillery. How much notice of an attack there is likely to be is again a matter of uncertainty. To put the matter in its worst aspect we have:— Little or no warning of an attack. Likelihood of a good percentage of Martini rifles among the attackers. Siege continued, though intermittently, for a week. 3. Timeiohen relief may be expected. —The double company of Indian infantry stationed at Robat in Baluchistan, aided possibly by some Baluchistan Levies, will, it is understood, be able to march to Nasratabad in five days; but may be delayed by water on the road, and it may be impossible to communicate with them when the first attack is made. Their approach is not likely to be seriously contested, and on their arriving within a day’s march the siege of the Consulate would probably be raised. 4. Garrison, British.

Outer Ztrae.—The disadvantages of the outer line are (i) enormous length compared with number of defenders. (ii) Restricted field of fire in certain directions. (Hi) The wall itself can easily he battered down. 'What is chiefly required is a number of bastions arranged to look down the length of wall on the outside so as to prevent the enemy gathering there. The main gate is admirably suited for this purpose, as from the roof the whole of the south-west wall is under fire. The gate however should be reconstructed, being made stronger with a covering of sheet iron to prevent its being set on fire and set further out so as not to leave a recess in which men can congregate. At present the wall does not run straight between the various salients, so that it would need a great many bastions indeed to defend it all. I propose therefore that as funds permit, and when the wall has to be renewed, it be rebuilt with perfectly straight lines. Bastions will then be necessary at the points marked B.C.D.E.E. The form they should take is that of an octagonal solid tower, about 10' in internal diameter, built into the wall and projecting some 4/ on the far side of the wall, with battlements to serve as loop holes. They will he built ostensibly as orna ments to the wall and will he strengthened with sandbags when required. 3 attfemerrt s os loopholes sThere will be a circular staircase inside and an iron door at the bottom. If the outer line is breached the garrison will not retire but will brin» a fire to bear on the enemy’s rear. The garrison should consist of not less than 3 sowars, and as many Afghans as can be given, up to 4 . They should be provided with water, food and ammunition for at least 24 hours. This paragraph also holds good as regards the main gate. ° The two small latrines projecting from the south-west corner should be removed and rebuilt elsewhere. 8 . Inner Zm^.—The Consulate building is extremely strongly built, the walls being three or four feet thick. Its chief disadvantage is its restricted field of fire to the south-west (the direction of the Escort lines). The garrison should not contain less than 7 sowars in addition to all the remaining rifles available. Most of the garrison will be stationed on the roof. Eor this purpose it is advisable that the parapet wall be continued right round the roof. A number of walls in the Consulate enclosure which cannot be enfiladed from the roof should be demolished. The block of cook-rooms (No. 2 in map) which is extremely close up to the main building should, if feasible, be removed at least as far as the block of stables (No. 3) when they next have to be rebuilt. There will be no difficulty about water, as by digging a few feet down through the floor it will be obtained. • .j 9 * ® eneral Remarks .—is a line of willows along the whole of the inside of the north wall. If barbed wire were threaded through this if would make a very efficient obstacle indeed. And if practicable willows should be grown around the other side and barbed wire, say a mile in all, be ordered from . 0f course the wire need not be attached until the outbreak of nubiiiiiiGS. A number of sandbags, say 3,000, should be ordered.

Cost of building bastions (vide paragraph 10 (1) of Lieutenant Moles- pre ^ 8 ^ or * R a g t &gt; worth’s Defence Scheme). i.ns. Lieutenant Molesworth has proposed that five bastions should be built- each bastion to be “ an octagonal solid tower, about 10' in internal diameter, built into the wall and projecting some 4s' on the far side of it, with battle ments to serve as loop-holes.” Ostensibly these bastions would be built as ornaments to the wall as in the case of the existing front gate. 2 . In order to enable men to fire from the roofs, these must be built level and not in the form of “ gumbazes ” as in the case of other buildings in the Consulate. This can be effected in two ways:— (1) By building a “ gumbaz ” or dome and then bringing up the level by depositing kankar, earth, etc. (as has been done in the front gate) ; or (2) By building the roofs of tamarisk as was, I believe, done in the case of some of the Mission buildings—for this purpose tamarisk would have to be imported from Minakungi. (1) would probably give better results and could be more easily arranged locally. 3. Dough estimate for a bastion.* Kraus.

Preliminary Eemarks. present ^ Gmo ^ifion of the block of servants’ quarters on the north-east side of 1 ’ 118 ’ P rG sent Consulate building is contemplated for reasons (1) of improvino- the defensive position of the Consulate, ( 2 ) replacing the present quarters, which are m a bad condition, by others more sanitary and better arranged. 2 . Q-he piesent block consists of ($) eight single quarters averaging nine feet in length and breadth, with walls of a thickness of 2 V and two courtyards, too- e - ther with three quarters and a courtyard which have been combined into a single married quarter, and {b) a detached line of three godowns and two addi tional servants' quarters with a pigeon and cow house built to the east of them. They are made of sun-burnt brick throughout, though, in some places, the lower portions of the walls have been lined with pucca brick in order to lessen the erosion caused by shora, 6When reconstructing, I would suggest that two married quarters should be built after the style of those made for the escort family lines last year. The dimensions might be slightly smaller (though, even so, larger than at present) : I would propose 12' by 10' with a courtyard 20' by 12'. Two such quarters would cost approximately krans 800, the cost of each quarter for the escort lines (which were somewhat larger) having amounted to krans 437. No sunk foundations would be made but the first two and a half feet would be of baked brick in order to avoid erosin by shora. The remaining quarters would be single and unprovided with courtyrads, though a general open courtyard might be constructed as shown in the plan. The total number of rooms necessary (including those for servants now in the separate block and godowns near pigeon house) would be thirteen. I have not, however, included all of these in the detailed estimate which relates only to the first block {vide paragraph 2 (a)). If approved their cost can be readily worked out on the basis of those already done. 3. The arrangement shown in the plan seemed to be the most convenient inasmuch as (i) quarters III, V and IV, VI can be easily converted into married quarters should this be at any time necessary, (ii) the godowns are practically detached as they face away from the quarters, (iii) the pigeon house and cow house are separate, (iv) the entire block is compact. 4. Each quarter will be provided with— {a) JBadgir or ventilation shaft. {b) Eire place. (&lt;?) Window in dome, if necessary. These are not being estimated for in detail, as their cost is small, but a small sum will be added to the detailed estimate. ft.

On the south and west sides the wall is comparatively straight, but on the north and east is full of curves and angles and would therefore be difficult to defend unless a large number of bastions were constructed and the defenders could spare men to hold them. Lieutenant Molesworth, R.E., recommended that these walls (which are also in a had state of repair) should be straightened. This will entail (a) taking in a little waste ground which lies outside the Con- su’ate, and {h) rebuilding the greater portion of the wall on the north and east sides.

The outer walls on the south and wes faces of the present Consulate buildinu have been carried to a height a little above the level of the roof and the upper part of the low wall thus made has been crenelated. This serves two purposes :— (11 It gives the building a more finished appearance, and (2) affords shelter to persons who may be called upon to defend the building from the roof. It has now been proposed to extend these battlements to the north and east faces and an approximate estimate of the probable cost, based on the present rates of burnt brick constsuction in Seistan (as worked out in building the foundations of the Escort lines) is given herewith It has been found necessary to reduce the thickness of the brickwork in places owirg to the space being encroached upon by the domed roofs which cover the central portion of the present building.

The rate, however, will probably be somewhat higher than that for laying foundations as bricks and material must bo conveyed to the roof and extra labour is thereby involved. At krans 50 per 100 cubic feet, the total cost will be krans 700 (seven hundred only). It is of course possible that the work may be carried out more cheaply, in which case the rates will be noted for future guidance, but I do not think the difference is likely to be considerable.

He was instructed to inform the local Director of Customs that the question of the importation was forming the subject of correspondence between the two Governments, and that if he had any complaints to make he should refer them to Tehran. I HAVE received your note of the 23rd ultimo respecting the import of cases (of arms) into Seistan via Kuh-i-Malik Siah, and under the escort of Indian soldiers, without the knowledge of, or inspection by, the Customs officials. I was very much surprised at your statement saying that the cases contained arms and ammunition necessary for the protection of the British Consulate. The excitement in Seistan was due to the quarantine arrangements and the measures taken against the religion. There has been no evil intention against the Consulate, and as you are aware the punishment of the offenders was postponed till after the disappearance of the epidemic, and as soon as the disease abated the punishment began. You are aware that the Persian Commissioner has been dealing with the mattei for some time, but he has not received sufficient assistance from the Consulate, otherwise the matter would have been settled by this time. The details of the case have been mentioned in my note of the 17th April last. Further, I do not need to point out to what extent the import of arms into the empire is prohibited by the Imperial Government. You are well aware that the British Government greatly shares the advantages of this prohibition. Whenever any arm is required by the members of the British Legation it is not imported without the special permission of the Persian Government. I do not see how on this particular occasion arms have been allowed to be imported without permission, and how you have allowed British officials to smuggle goods, to resist the Customs officials with severity, in refusing to allow the inspection, and to beat the Customs employes. You will no doubt agree with me that if reparation is not made the Persian Government will be exposed to great difficulties on account of similar cases. I have no doubt you will, after a little reflection, see the future difficulties of the Foreign Office, and you will take effective measures for the necessary reparation for the action of the British Consul in Seistan.

The Persian Government and the local authorities have been duly furnished with a list of the principal offenders who are still at large. His Majesty’s Consul has at all times been prepared to assist the local authorities to the best of his power. Your Highness is under a misappre- ension m supposing that the arms and ammunition were smuggled by His Maiestv’s Consul With my permission. They were introduced by ofder oChs MS' Government for the protection of the British Consulate, which was twice attacked L tbe b J eCtS 0 l HlS 1 % e | t y the Shah - Tt 18 also “ ot J’ 1 accordance with the facts that the Customs officials m Seistan were either beaten or threatened.37 vr [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] respecting the attacks on the British Consulate at Seistan, and the consequent importation of arms for the protection of the Consulate buildings and staff. Sir E. Grey is unable to believe the serious allegations which have been made by the Persian Government in regard to the conduct of the British quarantine inspectors, and he is surprised that such accusations should have been brought against British officials by the late Persian Minister in London. As regards the actual importation of arms—which is only forbidden in Persia for fear that they should reach the tribes, of which, in this case, there could be no question—it had become evident, as two attacks had been made on His Majesty’s Consulate during the past two years, that the Persian Government were unable to provide the requisite protection. It was therefore decided to send a certain number of rifles to the Consulate for the proper defence of its members, and as the Persian Government had on a previous occasion refused permission to import arms for a similar purpose, it was felt that neither the impotence of the Persian Government to afford protection, nor their refusal to allow the importation of a small number of rifles, should be allowed to endanger the Consulate, and the arms were consequently brought in.

NOV!SC u [October 19.] Section 4, [35681] Memorandum communicated by Mirza Mehdi Khan, October JO 1906 ON the 23rd August last tlie Persian Charg* d’Affaires communicated to His JJntannic Majesty s Foreign Office a telegram which he had received from the Sadre Azam m reference to the entry into Persian territory, at Malek Siah Kuh, of sixteen armed Indian soldiers who were escorting a caravan of thirty-eight camels and twelve eamel-dmeis, w ho forcibly took into Persia the camel loads, which all consisted of locked cases, without allowing them to be inspected by the Customs authorities and without giving any intimation to the Imperial Persian Government On the 11th ultimo, the Charge d’Affaires received a reply to' this communication fl ' ora . Car Mward Grey, stating that the camel loads contained thirty rifles which w^s required for the protection of His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate at Seistan, in view of two attacks which, it was stated, had been made on the Consulate. The Charge d’Affaires communicated Sir Edward Grey’s remarks to the Sadre Azam, and has now received a telegram from Prince Ala-os-Saltaneh, Minister for Toreign Atlairs, which is as follows - “ Your telegram in regard to the Seistan incident has been received. Say in reply to his Excellency Sir Edward Grey that the cause of the first attack on the 1 onsulate was that the European quarantine inspectors had taken various steps contrary to religion; they had burnt Kurans and prayer books, and had examined women in a naked condition, and this caused agitation among the populace.” Nevertheless, instructions have been given that apology may be offered for this incident. As regards the protection of the Consulate, the Imperial Government would have immediately supplied any number of guards that may have been considered needful, and would not have refused. Under these circumstances, it was not necessary that thirty-eight cases of arms should have been taken into Persia suddenly without the permission of the Government and without letting them be examined by the Customs officials, thus leading others to ask us for similar things and causing trouble. Moreover, thirty-eight cases must have contained more than thirty rifles and it cannot be conceived that so much arms had been necessary for a Consulate In View ol these facts and reasons, it is expected that His Britannic Majesty’s Government siiouid make reparation for this unlooked-for action. You will communicate this to his Excellency the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and inform me of the result As regards the second so-called attack, it cannot he called an attack; a few thieves had gone at night to commit theft, but they fled as soon as the servants of the Consulate woke up. k October 19, 1906. 2173 t- 3l [This Docnment is the Property of Hig Britannic Majesty's Government.!S' fh.' rxA /v ; ' XL - J !*r y 0 NOV ipQt; (Zaddet idk 1715- Telegram No. 227-C., dated the 14th (received 17th) April 1906.

General Officer Commanding has enquired whether escort with officer, can visit Padagi and report on it, and I see no objection to his visiting there, but the question of location of our troops there, if it is suitable, seems to need very careful consideration.

I have replied that supplies are abundant, but I cannot guarantee laying them out unless provided with necessary trans port, as no dependence can be placed on obtaining local transport when required, and it would be inadvisable to lay out the supplies until the last moment for fear of attracting attention. Suggest, therefore, 100 extra camels should be retained now at Robat to be placed at my disposal whenever required. They will be required in any case later if troops move here.

Mr. Hughes gives me to understand that the services of the Robat Levies may be required on the trade route. I am of opinion, on reconsidering the matter, that they could now be withdrawn with safety. Plague appears to be dying out, and the likelihood of further disturb ances is therefore lessened. The arrival of troops in Robat has undoubtedly had an effect on the people here. Lastly, the recent action of the Deputy Governor in the Bunjar incident has shown the people that the local authori ties are not always prepared to shield them. I would recommend, however, that their withdrawal, whenever it may be effected, be made conditional on the grant of certain concessions by the Persian Government. These might be:—Firstly, permission to bring in arms and ammunition now lying at Robat, the necessity for which has been amply demonstrated; and secondly, permission to increase the strength of the escort to 30 men. Having regard to what has occurred, the Persian Government may find some difficulty in disputing our claim. As regards the increase of the escort, this would seem to be desirable now for several reasons. The strength of the Russian escort is 30 men, and the numerical inferiority of our escort has undoubtedlv been noted by the people, and in a country where great importance attaches to military display, probably tends to increase their influence at our expense. Moreover, the suggested increase may conceivably be necessary for the pur pose of protection, since we cannot overlook the possibility of a recurrence of plague and the likelihood of disturbances in consequence.

The strength of our escort in Seistan should, I think, be equal to that of the Russian Consulate. The Persian Government will certainly refuse the request to bring in arms and ammunition. I recently recommended that all the Consular escorts in Persia should be strengthened, but His Majesty’s Government do not consider in case of anti- foreign outbreak that such guards could afford sufficient protection. Personally, I disbelieve in any Persian mob facing a few determined men.

Daukes, His Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. It is reported that the Persian official deputed to investigate disturbances of March last is within a few days march of Seistan. It is also reported that reinforcements of Persian troops, wirh guns and mounted men, are moving towards Seistan from Khorasan. As far as can he ascertained they number some three or four hundred men. The Deputy Governor lias also come into Husseinabad, and is for the first time co-operating with the Director of Customs. Steps are being taken to disinfect some of the houses in Husseinabad. It is rumoured here that the Persian Government intend inflicting sum mary punishment on the persons involved in the disturbances of March last. General feeling of unrest exists in Husseinabad owing to uncertainty as to how the new official will act. Ringleaders of disturbances are spreading rumours, which seem designed to reach my ears, that any attempt to implicate them will result in further disturbances. This action is probably due to the belief that we alone induced the Persian Government to take energetic measures. As far as can be judged anxiety is confined to those persons who have something to fear, and the character of any disturbances which might occur would probably he entirely local. No. 155 repeated to Mr. Grant-Duff and Major Kennion. Telegram, No. 340 C., dated the 11th (received 14th) July 1906. From—L ieutenant C. T. Daukes, His Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul for Seistan and Kain, 7 0 _The Foreign Secretary, Simla. About midnight last night a number of men, who are said to he inhabit ants of Husseinabad, created a disturbance directed against this Consulate. It was impossible, owing to the darkness, to obtain reliable information of their numbers or identity, hut there were probably some ten or twelve persons. They were armed with sticks, and scaling the Consulate wall, maltreated some Consulate employes who happened to bo sleeping outside owing to the heat. None of these, however, were more than slightly bruised. On the escort falling in, the rioters bolted. Owing to the darkness, pursuit was impossible. I wrote in strong terms to the Deputy Governor of Seistan, informing him of what had occurred and requesting him to take steps to protect the Hritish Consulate. In my opinion, this disturbance was entirely artificial, and was worked up by the ringleaders of the disturbances of March last for the purposes of intimi dation. The rumours referred to in my telegram No. 338 C., dated the 10th July 1906, appear to have been well founded. There was no excitement in the first place in Husseinabad or the city, as w T as the case in the disturbances of March last. Secondly, the rioters seems to have acted in accordance with a preconcerted plan, as they chose the lowest part of the wall at a point as far distant as possible from the sentry’s beat. And thirdly, the whole incident had the appearance rather of an organised demonstration against us than of any spontaneous expression of feeling on the part of the people. There is no sign of any excitement to-day. Although the present incident does not appear very serious in itself, it serves to indicate the attitude that is likely to be adopted by the persons involved in the disturbances of March last. It is possible that nothing may happen. It is also possible that the ringleaders of these disturbances, some of whom are very inttuential men, may succeed in working up an agnation against us which we must look to our own resources to meet, owing to the present lethargic attitude of the Persian Government. Such an agitation, if it occurred at all, might occur any day, and I have accordingly ventured to assume responsibility for despatching some levies to Itobat under the commandof a Duffadar of the Consulate escort, and have requested the Officer Com manding the detachment at Robat to hand over to them the spare arms and ammunition which were sent there as a reserve for the Consulate here. These they will then escort here. I trust that approval may be extended to this action. Repeated to Major Kennion, and as No. 156 to Mr. Grant Duff. Telegram, No. 2213 F., dated the 14th July 1900.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Attack on the Seistan Consulate. Please see my telegram of the 14th July 1906. Whatever may have been the motives of the assailants, an attack on the British Consulate at night in town excited by the plague riots is so serious a development, that we consider that, in addition to the demand for an apology of the Persian Government and punishment of all the persons concerned, the necessity has been established for increasing the strength of the escort to that of the Russians, and for placing an adequate reserve of arms and ammunition in the Consulate, such as the Russians were shown to possess in the riots that occurred in March last. The military authorities question the advis ability of sending arms with ten levies. We agree, and propose to send 50 men of the double company with a British Officer as escort to prevent the risk of a collision with the Customs officials or the mob. On the arrival of the Persian troops, the arms escort would be withdrawn after raising the Consular escort to the strength of the Russian guard, provided that the Persian troops show that they are intended to maintain, and are capable of maintaining, order. The Chagai Levies would remain until the situation quiets down. Indeed, but for the presence of the escort and levies, the consequences of a night attack on the Consulate might have been lamentable, as the raiders only withdrew when the guard fell in. In view of the serious position of affairs there we would again press for the completion of the telegraph to Seistan. Russians have five direct lines across the frontier now of Persia.

Daukes, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please refer to my telegram No. 340 C. The Officer Commanding the detachment at Robat informs me that he cannot send up the spare arms and ammunition without the express orders of the Government of India. I gather that discretion had been allowed to the Consul in Seistan —vide telegram from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State, dated the 16th April, and your telegram to the Consul, No. 1629 E., dated the 24th May 1906. My action was based on this assumption. lhat the reserve of arms and ammunition is required is clear from the Viceroy’s telegram to the Secretary of State, No. 3234 E., dated the 9th September 1905, and from the fact that they have been sent to Robat.13 I would point out that the present moment is a particularly favourable one for importing them. My reasons for thinking so are as follows:— (1) If energetic action is taken by the new official who has arrived here, it is possible that the ringleaders of the riots of last March, some of whom are influential men, may work up an agitation against us, since it is well known that the action of the Persian Government in investigating the affair is due to the pressure which we brought to bear on them. The disturbance reported 1 in my telegram No. 340 C., though not very serious in itself, proves that the ringleaders are sufficiently influential to effect this. In such a case the reserve of arms and ammunition might be required. (2) In view of the fact that no steps have yet been taken by the Persian Government to punish the rioters of last March ; that another disturbance, probably instigated by the same men, has taken place; and that, under the circumstances some possibility of further trouble exists, our action in bringing in the reserve of arms and ammunition could not be considered altogether unjustifiable. I think that it will be possible to get in the arms without attracting atten tion, in which case no question would be raised. Sent to Messed, and to Tehran as No. 158.

His Majesty’s Government agree that the Consular escort may be raised to the same number as the Russian escort, viz., thirty. They consider, however, that the 23 levies sent to Nasrata- bad in the spring should be withdrawn, if and when reinforcements arrive and Persian authorities are again in a position to maintain security. Otherwise their presence may serve as an excuse foi’ a corresponding increase to the Eussian escort. His Majesty’s Government also agree that reserves of arms and ammunition may be sent as soon as possible to Nasratabad. Objections, however, stated in Foreign Office letter of 15th May last, forwarded with Secretary’s letter, dated 8th June, still hold good, and in order not to attract undue attention, arms may be introduced under escort of levies to whom ten men to he added to Consular escort might be attached, should this be practicable.No. 350 C., dated the 21st July 1906 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant C. T. Daukes, His Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to my telegram No. 340 C., dated the 11th Jnly 1906, I have the honour to report as follows regarding the disturbance which took place here on the night of the 10th July. About midnight we were awakened by a clamour which arose from the direction of the hospital. The whole Consulate was aroused by the uproar, and, on hurrying outside, I found that the Jemadar commanding the escort had already fallen in his men and was hastening towards the place whence the shouts were proceeding. 2 . We found about fifteen or twenty Consulate empolyes collected together, among whom was Khan Sahib Ahmad Din, the Attache ot the Meshed Consulate, who was en route to Meshed. They seemed to be somewhat excited, and on my enquiring what had occurred, informed us that a crowd of men, armed with sticks, had suddenly appeared on the scene about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before. These men had apparently opened proceedings by throwing stones, clods of earth, &amp;c., at all persons sleeping outside, had beaten one or two who attempted to resist them, and had broken down the wooden door which leads frorn ^ the hospital courtyard into the actual Consulate compound. Seth Suleimanji, one of the British traders here, who was at the time occupying a house exactly opposite the Consulate hospital, had also been awakened, and happening to be armed with a revolver, had fired a few shots into the air with the object of attracting the attention of the sentry over the quarter guard. A few moments afterwards the escort was heard turning out and the rioters bolted. 3 . We found that several persons, including Khan Sahib Ahmad Din, had been bruised, but no one was seriously hurt. Owing to the darkness, and the confusion which inevitably ensues from an incident of this kind at night, it is difficult to discover the number or identity of the offenders. In fact, beyond that they spoke Persian, nothing is known for certain. There do not appear to have been more than a dozen men concerned in the affair, but re iorts are conflicting, and some of the persons present say there were twenty or thirty. 4 . An additional sentry was posted near the place where the incident had occurred, but the rioters did not approach the Consulate again. The next day I wrote to the Deputy Governor, informing him of what had taken place, and askin 0, him to take steps to protect the Consulate and to investigate the affair. The Mustaufi arrived during the afternoon and made some enquiries from those who had been present at the disturbance. The enquiry was conducted in a very superficial manner and was naturally barren of result, and this in spite of the fact that I begged him to make a full and careful investigation on the spot, pointing out the advantages of doing so while the incident was fresh in the minds of the witnesses. A guard of ten sarbazes from the Kerai regiment was also sent by the Yawar who commands them. 5. The Deputy Governor did not call on me at once, which, it seems to me, is the least that courtesy demanded. He wrote, however, expressing his regret at what had occurred On r the 19th July, as no further steps seemed to have been taken by the local authorities, I sent Fazl Rahman to visit the Deputy Governor at Bala Khana (a village about five miles distant from Nasratabad, where the Deputy Governor has been living since the first outbreak of plague in the city), with instructions to inform him that, unless he came m to see me, and also took measures to settle some of our pending cases, I would have no alternative but to regard his lopg-continued procrastination in all affairs toucmug thisConsulate as equivalent to a refusal to have dealings with us, and Would inform xny Government accordingly. This threit appears to have frightened hwn a little, as he immediately paid up the fine of 50 tomans which had been inflicted on the Bunjar villagers (vide diary entry for 26th June), and came to call on tne the following day. 6 . I opened the proceedings bv telling him that I had been expecting to see him every day since the 10th July, and that, it seemed to me, the least he could have done was to express his regret personally. To this he replied that he had been unwell—a statement which I know to be incorrect. I then recapitulated the many outstanding cases of this Consulate, and asked him if he intended to take any action, and if so, when. In the matter of the original disturbances he replied that, without definite instructions from Tehran, he could not punish any of the more influential ringleaders, such as Mulla ^Muhammad Taki, Mulla Muhammad Hassan, &amp;c., but was ready to punish certain individuals of minor importance who were present on the attack on the dispensary* This he insisted was his final decision, and he could not deviate a hair’s breadth from it. 7. As regards the recent disturbance, he said he was making private enquiries, but that, although he had discovered a clue, he had not yet been able to lay his hands on the ottenders. His suspicions rested on the village of Gauri, a small village a short distance from the city. I told him that it was commonly reported that the ringleaders of the March disturbances were also at the bottom of the recent disgraceful incident, and he acknowledged that this w^as possible, but said that no evidence was forthcoming in support of the supposition. Finally, he expressed his willing ness immediately to take up the other pending cases of this Consulate, and, as regards these, I believe him to be in earnest. I have accordingly sent Fazl Bahman out to Bala Khana to-day, as my representative, to start hearing these cases in conjunction with him. 8 . From the above it will be clear that although he has, with consider able difficulty, been prevailed upon to bestir himself in the minor cases, he still maintains his attitude of aloofness in the far more important matter of taking action against the Hussainabad rioters. 9. As I have frequently stated in my diaries, there can be very little doubt that this reluctance is due to the fact that he is himself indirectly impli cated, and that certain of the ringleaders of those rioters were the agents of the local authorities in stirrring up the March disturbances against the Customs, of whom they are extremely jealous. Unfortunately the disturbances against the Customs reacted against our selves, and hence the willingness of the Deputy Governor to punish the indivi duals who were actually present at the attack on our dispensary (with whom he is probably extremely annoyed himself), but not the real fermenters of the riot. 10. The fact that he is ostensibly unable to discover the persons impli cated in the incident of lOih July, corroborates my view that these were the adherents of the ringleaders of the March disturbances. 11 . The action of the Deputy Governor in writing to Mujtahid Sheikh Raza (vide diary entry for the 4th July) informing him that his name had been included in the list of ringleaders by mistake and had later been with drawn, undoubtedly had a bad effect, since, whether Sheikh Raza was really guilty or not, it impressed on the other ringleaders that even the more influ ential men were not entirely immune, and that the affair had not blown over as they had thought. Shortly afterwards the new official, who has been deputed by the Persian Government to investigate the March disturbances, was reported to be within a few days’ march, and at the same time a rumour was current (in which there appears to be a stratum of truth) that troops were being moved down here from Khorasan. 12 . An access of nervousness seems to have overcome those among the inhabitants of Hussainabad whose consciences made cowards of them, and they probably thought the easiest method of relieving their feelings was to vent3 their displeasure against those who were commonly reported to have induced tWPersian Government to take steps in the matter (whereby they also pre sumably hoped to intimidate us from further interference). 13. As I reported in my diary for 9th July, the rioters of last March seem to have been intoxicated with their success. They effected their object on the first occasion (when all attempt to cope actively with the plague had to be abandoned) and probably think they hold a trump card for future use. 14. I attach the statements of (1) Khan Sahib Ahmad Din; (2) Seth Suleimanji, both of whom were actually present during the disturbance. 15. Copies of this letter, and enclosures, have been forwarded to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed. (Statement No. 1.) Statement of Khan Sahib Ahmad Din, en route to Meshed. On the night of the 10th of July 1906 I was asleep in the courtyard con necting the inner set of quarters, where the ladies of my party were temporarily residing, with the outer set of quarters containing the dispensary—which has been vacant since the occurrence of the first plague riot—when, at about a quarter to eleven, two of my servants, who were sleeping in the outer courtyard, rushed in, madly shouting that a number of Seistanis had assaulted them, and were dismantling the Consulate wall. I got up instantly, and had hardly emerged from the small side door bet ween the two courtyards, when I was received with a volley of stones, which, to judge from thier large number and the rapidity with which they were thrown, appeared to be thrown by at least 10 persons. The moon had just risen, and the light, being in our faces, did not permit of our seeing far. I, however, saw a man mounted on the low wall encircling the outer hospital courtyard, dismantling with an axe the corner of the Consulate wall. A stone hit me on the right shoulder and another on the head, and as I was not armed, I retired with the two men. After having pacified the ladies, who were very much alarmed, I made another rush to see what had happened to the other servants, but was again forced to retire. Meanwhile, I had sent the two servants to the Consulate building and to the sowars’ quarters, to raise the alarm. Another man had by now attacked the door leading from the outer courtyard into the Consulate grounds, and began hammering at it with an axe. Before help could arrive a third man had attacked the side small door between the two courtyards. I stood for full 15 minutes with my back to this door while the man was hammerin°- at it on the other side, when Mr. Pazl Rahman, accompanied by a few men! rushed in. Unfortunately, none had any arms. The sowars and others had now arrived and were proceeding to the bigger door, when both the ruffians fled. We opened the door, and Fazl Rahman and myself on going out received such a well-directed shower of stones that we beat a retreat. A few minutes later, we made another attempt, and saw two men, all naked with the exception of their trousers, running towards the open ground in front of the hospital. Lieutenant Daukes and Captain Kelly arrived on the scene shortly afterwards. Seistan; 1 Ahmad Din, Attache, The 12th July 1906. j Khorasan Agency.

Seistan ; \ c - T - Vatjkvs, Lieut., The 12th July 1906. ) Sis Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan * and Rain.{Statement No. 2.) Statement of Seth Suliemanji, trader, of Seistan, About 11 p. m. last night, as I was sleeping outside my house, near the Consulate compound, I was awakened by hearing a noise outside as of men digging into a wall. On getting up, I found a number of men were collected in front of the Consulate wall. Some of them seemed to be digging bits out of the wall, while others were throwing stones at the Consulate servants and others, who were sleeping inside. The wall is low at this place, so they were able to throw clods of earth oyer it. Shortly afterwards, some of them began to throw clods of earth in my direction, and to curse me. I told my wife to fetch my revolver, and on her bringing it, I fired a shot in the air to warn the sowars in the Consulate lines. For some time, however, no one came, and the rioters continued throwing stones, and some of them broke down the door which leads into the inner compound. The Consulate servants and others were entirely taken by surprise, and the only one who attempted to resist was a servant of mine, who got beaten for his pains. Shortly afterwards, when the escort came to the spot the rioters bolted off. As it was night, it was impossible to make out where they went. J There seemed to be five or six men, but Ghulam Muhammad, my servant, says there were ten or twelve more. I think myself they were Baluchis, but cannot speak with certainty. I did not recognise any of them. I am certain they did not come for theft, but with the fixed intention of creating a disturbance; this is obvious, since they made no attempt to act stealthily 5 in any sense of the word one of the rioters recognised me, but I could not recognise him. He said—“ We have nothing to do with you, go away”. I know many of the Persians here, as I have traded here for some years, and many of them know me. Above read over to Seth Suliemanji, and admitted to be correct. Seistan, The 11th July 1906. i C. T.

T. D aukes, Ilia Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 26, for the period 2nd to 8th July 1906. Troops in Robat .—The double company in Robat appear to be undergoing considerable hardship ; it is reported that 30 % of the men are hors de combat owing to dysentery and fever, and this is confirmed by private letters, etc , received from the detachment. Lieutenant Mainwaring White and Mr. Hughes are both apparently more or less on the sick list, and it is said that the water becomes worse day by day. Even during the cold weather, the most favourable period, the water at Robat is brackish, so it can easily be imagined that the present strain on the water-supply, combined with the heat of the summer, the barrenness of the site, and the mountainous character of the surrounding coun try, which precludes all exercise with the exception of walking, may well unite in rendering the conditions of life there almost insupportable. In the matter of water there is but little to choose from one end of the Trade Route to the other, more especially during the hot weather, but, from my own experience, I would suggest that Kirtaka (two marches from Robat) would be a more favourable site for a camp at this period. There is more space there, since the hills at that point merge into the open plain, and it -would be easier to arrange for some means of taking exercise and recreation. Judging from the present position here it seems improbable that a difference of two marches would greatly affect the political or military position. In the light of present events, it seems somewhat unfortunate that Captain Macpherson’s suggestion that con densers should be provided, was not acted on. This, however, is a matter on which the local officers are better qualified to express an opinion. ***** * * Memo. No. 52-C., dated Simla, the 6th August 1906.

Sir E. Grey will observe that the Officer Commanding at Itobat is taking no action in the matter pending the receipt of orders from the Government of India, who are awaiting the decision of His Majesty’s Government.

I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant relative to the recent rioting in Seistan and the pro posals made by the Government of India to secure the safety of His Maiestv’s Consulate. J J . sir E * prey concurs that the strength of the Consular escort should he raised to thirty men, the number of the escort attached to the Russian Consul. . would, however, point out, for Mr. Morley’s consideration, that the 23 levies sent to proteet the Consulate last spring are still at Nasratabad, and that, if and when the Persian reinforcements arrive and the authorities are once more in a position to cope with the rioters and to maintain security, these men might well be withdrawn. Their presence might otherwise serve as an excuse for a corresponding increase in the Russian escort. As regards the supply of arms and ammunition for His Majesty’s Consulate Sir E. Grey agrees that they should be sent to Nasratabad as soon as possible! He sees, however, no reason to modify the views expressed in my letter 16276 of 15 May last regarding the entry of British troops into Persia. He would depre cate this step unless absolutely necessary for the protection of His Majesty’s Consul, as likely to offend Persian and Russian susceptibilities, to form an undesirable precedent for similar action on the part of Russia in the future to provoke local animosity, and to diminish the responsibility of the Persian 20authorities for the maintenance of security and order. He would therefore suggest, for Mr. Morley’s consideration, that the arms should if possible be introduced under the escort of levies, whose movements on the frontier do not attract undue attention, to whom might be attached the ten sowars to be added to the Consular escort. As regards the telegraph extension to Seistan, Sir E. Grey is disposed to think that, as Mr. Grant Duff has received Extract taken for separate file. ^ y iccroy &gt; s telegrams and is Well aware of the views of His Majesty Government on the subject, it is not neces sary to send him further instructions.

Daukes, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul for Seistan and Kam, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. . 1 hav ® honour to report that the reserve arms and ammunition for the Seistan and Meshed Consulates, accompanied by an escort of two non-com missioned officers and eight men of the 128th Pioneers (Robat escort), and six Chagai Levies, arrived here safely at dawn on the 9th instant. On the 7th August I received a letter from the Officer Commanding the Robat escort informing me that under instructions from Head-Quarters, he had despatched the above-mentioned arms and ammunition, and that the ten non- comnussioned officers and men were to remain in Seistan “ as an increase to the Consular guard until relieved by an equal number of sowars, who are being arranged for. r&lt; r ce ^y ec [ no information on the subject, and was unaware it had been decided to bring in the arms and ammunition. The party, consisting of the escort previously referred to, and 38 camels, left Robat on the evening of the 5th instant and marched direct through Koh- i-Malik Siah to Hurmak, where they halted. The Customs officials made some attempt to stop the caravan, but on Muhammad Ashraff Khan, the Vice- Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah, informing them that the caravan was carrying Government property, which was urgently required by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul in Seistan and Kain, and that all questions would be answered by him in direct communication with the Director of Posts and Customs, Seistan, they permitted the party to proceed as far as Hurmak. It seems, however, that no sooner had the caravan actually passed Koh-i- Malik Siah, than the Mirza in temporary charge of the post was overcome by misgivings, and despatched a few Baluch sowars and Sarbazes to prevent its onward progress, and to bring it hack. These men, planting themselves on the caravan track leading to Nasratabad, refused to permit any forward movement, and informed the non-commissioned officer that lie must return. This he refused to do, and a man was sent back to Koh-i-Malik Siah to acquaint the Vice-Consul with the state of affairs. The Vice-Consul, then came out to Hurmak, and after some further parley, the Baluch sowars Sarbazes were withdrawn. The Director of Customs has officially informed me that the Vice-Consul instructed the men of the escorting party to employ force in the event of the Sarbazes persisting in the obstructive attitude adopted by them. The Vice- Consul, however, does not admit the truth of this assertion, and it is probable that the local Customs officials have exaggerated the true facts in order to put their own zeal and energy in the most favourable light. The following night (6th August) the party proceeded to Girdeh, a distance of about 38 miles, and thence on the night of the 7th August, to Lutak, a distance of about 32 miles. Prom Hurmak to Lutak the track lies across the desert, and no opposition was to he feared. In the meantime I first heard of the despatch of the arms and ammunition from the Officer Commanding the Robat escort on the 'Jth instant; I also received on the same date a letter from the Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah informing me of what had occurred at Hurmak. The Persian post between Nasratabad and Koh-i-Malik Siah (which is of course under Customs control) is carried by the followers of a man named Pasand Khan, a notorious Russian Agent {vide my letter No. 332-C., dated the 3rd July).. It was extremely probable that both the Russians and Customs- received accurate information of the movements of the caravan at least as 24«arly as myself, since their post, like our own, travels day and night, and must obviously gain on a slow marching caravan which needs a certain propor tion of rest. On receiving the information referred to, it immediately became apparent that there was a great risk of the caravan being waylaid by parties of men sent out by the Customs authorities (who would probably be urged to take this step by the Eussians) to intercept it. The danger lay in the possibility of the caravan marching into a body of thirty or forty men, •who, acting under instructions, would simply refuse to permit them to enter the British Consulate without first entering the Customs caravanserai in Nasratabad. It is clear that the Customs officials would, in the circumstances, be within their rights in taking such action. Monsieur Cattersel is well known to be, to a very great extent, under Bussian influence, and although on friendly terms with this Consulate, he is always ready to sacrifice our interests when they clash with those of the Russians. It was obviously to the interests of the Russians to place every possible hindrance in our path, and by far the most effective method of doing so was to get the caravan, by hook or crook, into the Customs caravanserai, where it would have been, to all intents and purposes, in the hands of the Persian Government. Both the Customs and Russians doubtless recognized the fact that it was essential for us to avoid a collision and that, if suddenly confronted by a large number of men (even supposing the latter made no show of force), our small escort w r ould be placed in a difficult position. They were probably encouraged in taking up this line of action by the belief that it could not be really intended to resort to force. The three factors which had complicated the situation were—firstly, the Customs had been deliberately forced ; secondly, suspicion had been previously aroused by the de patch, only a few weeks before, of a number of levies under the escort duffadarto Robat {vide my telegram No, 340-C., dated 11th July) ; thirdly, affairs in Seistan being for the moment normal, there 'was no apparent pretext for the action taken. Had the escort been larger, the affair would have assumed an entirely different aspect. With the small escort sent, the only safe plan was to avoid Koh-i-Malik Siah and to march rapidly by unfre quented tracks. This unfortunately was impossible to arrange, as the local knowledge was not forthcoming at Robat and could only have been supplied from this Consulate, as the tracks are little known. No information of the intended importation of the arms having been received here, nothing could be done. In the circumstances, the only feasible plan seemed to be to divert the caravan suddenly, and avoid the regular route into Nasratabad. I accordingly sent Pazal Rahman Khan, on the night of the 7th instant, to Lutak, with instruc tions to ascertain whether any steps had been taken by the Customs to obstruct the forward movement of the caravan, and if such was the case, to bring it by a forced march, and as secretively as possible, by a circuitous route, avoiding all well-known tracks, to the Consulate. Pazal Rahman Khan has an unrivalled knowledge of the country and the people, and had it not been for him, it is possible the caravan w r ould have been ignominiously led into the Customs caravanserai. He found the party encamped a short distance out of Lutak (about 24 miles distance from Nasratabad by the ordinary track), and watched by a couple of men who had evidently received instructions not to lose sight of them. On his way out, he had learnt that the two main tracks leading into Nasratabad from Lutak were watched by parties of twenty to forty men, and another party had also been stationed at Sekhua (5 miles distant from Lutak) through which place it was supposed our men must pass. The men who were sent °out were apparently Baluch sowars (Passand Khan's men) and were in all probability armed after a fashion, and numerically superior, and it is just possible they might have shown a sufficiently determined front to render resort to force inevitable.Although the men of the escort and the camels were wearied out by their exertions since leaving Hurmak, Eazal Rahman insisted on the whole party leaving the same evening. The two Customs sowars above referred to, who were presumably also somewhat fatigued, were left sleeping outside Lutak. The party then made a long and difficult forced march, under the guidance of Eazal Rahman, avoiding Sekhua and the regular tracks, and finally arrived in this Consulate at dawn on the 9th instant. In my opinion Eazal Rahman is deserving of the greatest credit for the manner in which he brought in the caravan under circumstances of considerable difficulty. TheHavildar of the guard also acquitted himself well and appears worthy of commendation for the tact and discretion displayed. Unfortunately the forcing of the Customs post at Koh-i-Malik Siah in the circumstances related above, must inevitably create a certain amount of friction, the more so since there is every reason to believe that the Russians here are doing all in their power to present the affair in a most exaggerated light. The Director of Customs has officially protested, and I have informed him 5 in reply, that enquiries will be made, and that, in the meantime, I trust he will accept with all reservation statements implying that the escort intended to employ force.27 Telegram No. 203, dated Robat the 26th (received the 27t,h) August 1906.

Owing to the want of a telegraph line, an intimation of the despatch of the arms could not reach yon before the Officer Commanding at Robat informed you that he found it desirable to send them off at once.

'••**** /th August, Importation of arms and ammunition and increase of Consular escort I received a letter from the Officer Commanding the Bobat escort in- orming me that, under instructions from head-quarters, he had, on the 5th in- s act, despatched a caravan of 38 camels carrying the reserve arms and ammuni- lon tor the Seistan and Meshed Consulates to this Consulate, escorted by 2 non commissioned officers and 8 men of the 128th Pioneers, and 6 Chagai Levies. He gave me to understand that the non-commissioned officers and men of the 128th loneeis were to remain in Seistan pending relief by an equal number of sowars who were being arranged for. I also received a letter from MuhammadAshraft Khan, the Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah, relating the incidents conse quent on forcing the Customs post at Koh-i-Malik Siah. Full details of the march of the caravan and its arrival here are being despatched under separate cover. I would, however, venture to remark that the forcing of the Customs post with such a small escort was somewhat risky. With a large escort the affair would have assumed an entirely different aspect, while with a small escort it was almost imperative to avoid the post and march hy unfrequented tracks. Unfortunately, the necessary local knowledge could not be forthcoming at Robat, and, as I had received no information, there was no opportunity for communication with the Officer Commanding the Robat escort, and nothing could, therefore, be done. 9th August.

Belief for Russian escort. —The 18 Cossacks mentioned in Meshed Diary (entry for 16th August (2)) have arrived at Birjand. I hear that additional stables are being built in the Russian Consulate grounds, and it is of course probable that, in view of the action taken by us recently’ an attempt will be made to pass them off as reinforcements sent as a counter-blast to the Chagai levies. I do not think there is any likelihood of further disturbances now ; the Mumtehan-ul-Sultana appears to be a strong man, and that is really all that has been needed in Seistan. In these circum stances it might be advisable to withdraw the levies as soon as possible in order to leave no excuse for the Russians to keep the additional Cossacks. Moreover, the hands of the Mumtehan-ul-Sultana would thereby be strength ened, since he would doubtless take all the credit to himself and would impress on his Government that it was largely his influence which had induced us to withdraw the men. It is most desirable that his influence with his own Government should not be lessened, as he is well disposed to us and can help us in many ways. He tells me that the Persian Government regard with some suspicion the coincidence of his arrival with the importation of the arms from Robat, and that their suspicions are by no means allayed by unfavourable reports made by both the Russians and the Customs. The former regard him as Anglophile, and the latter have been trying to make him the scapegoat in the arms affair, alleging that he failed in his duty in that the caravan would never have suc ceeded in arriving at Nasratabad* had he taken prompt measures, **#*«*• Telegram No. 854, dated (and received) the 17th September 1906.

This mornins: the Governor-General sent me a message by the Attache to the effect that he had received a telegram from the Mumtahin-us-Sultana in Seistan, stating that the British had brought in some boxes of rifles from Bobat. The Telegraph Master in Seistan had also wired to him to say that the British had also brought in ten “ British ” soldiers and six levies with some boxes of rifles : further that they were asking for a grant of 10,000 zars of land as an addition to their Consulate, and for the deportation of four leading ringleaders of the March riot. This afternoon 1 sent the Attache to tell the Asaf-ud-Dowlah that the report about the importation of some rifles into Seistan was perfectly true, also that six native levies accompanied them, who would return to Kobat, and that ten sepoys who also came with them, as an escort would, for the present, remain, so that the British Consulate escort in Seistan would now be the same as that of the Russians. I reminded him that four and-a half months have now elapsed since the occurrence of the attack on the British hospital in Seistan, and that owing to constant delays on the part of the Persian Government a mamur had only just recently arrived there to en quire into the affair, and up till now nothing had been done : that during these four months British subjects in Seistan had been subjected to constant insults and annoyances, culminating three wueks ago in a night-attack on the Consulate itself : that all this time the British Government could, if it had so chosen, have sent in troops and arms to Seistan, but, while keeping them ready at Robat, had preferred to give the Persian Government every opportunity to deal with the matter itself, and had abstained from hampering its action in any way. This last attack on the Consulate had, however, precipitated matters, and the British Government was obliged to take steps to protect its representatives in Seistan. Further, that if we had desired, we could very easily have smuggled these weapons into Seistan without any one’s knowledge, but had preferred to bring them in openly in the way reported. *•*•**• Extract from Meshed Diary No. V3, for week ending the 18th August 1906. • ***•« • Monday, 13th August .—The Naib-Karguzar of Seistan has reported that 33 loads of rifles on camels have arrived at the British Consulate escorted by Native sowars : that the Customs officials at Koh-i-Malik Siah tried to stop them, and a Customs employd followed them for five farsakhs ; he w r as then beaten by the soldiers and taken by them on to Seistan and only released when the loads had been delivered in the Consulate.

The Persian official who was recently deputed to Seistan has on several occasions approached me on the subject of the withdrawal of levies. On my enquiring when we might expect the withdrawal of the four rioters whose deportation he agreed to recommend, he has returned vague answers. As far as can be ascertained, the Russians have retained 14 of the Cossacks recently sent in relief of their escort, and thus the Russian escort now numbers about 45 men. It seems probable that as long as we retain the levies they intend to retain these additional men. This fact is probably recognised by the Persian official here, and perhaps possible that he may press case against rioters more strongly in the hope of securing withdrawal of reinforcement from both Consulates. In these cir cumstances, it would appear advisable that the levies should be retained. Repeated as No. 194 to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran; Foreign with Viceroy; and Consul-General, Khorasan.

ACCORDING to the report received from the Ministry of the Customs (copy of which is herewith inclosed) on the 5th instant, 16 armed Indian soldiers, with a convoy consisting of 36 camels and 12 drivers, entered Persian territory'. They refused to allow the cases which were closed to be examined by the Customs officials at Kuh-i- Malik-Siah, and threatened to fire on them. The officer in charge of the customs informed the British Vice-Consul at Kuh-i-Malik-Siah, who replied that by the instructions of the British Consul in Seistan he could not accept the representations made by the Persian Customs officials, and that he would not allow the cases to be examined. The cases were then taken to Hermuch Lutak and thence to Seistan by an unfrequented road. At every place the Customs officials were prevented from inspecting the cases, and were threatened with firing on them. At Seistan the Customs employes were beaten and sent back by force, and the cases taken to the British Consulate. I consider it necessary to bring this untoward but important incident to your notice, and I have no doubt that you vull share my surprise at this action of British officials, which is inconsistent with the friendly relations between our respective Governments, and contrary to the rights of the Persian Customs. You will instruct the proper authorities not to prevent the Customs officials from inspecting the cases, and you will inform me of the reasons of this unexpected action on the part of British officials, and also how the persons responsible for this action will be reprimanded.

I HAD the honour to receive your note of the 20th instant, complaining of the importation into Seistan, via Kuh-i-Malik-Siah, of a number of cases under a guard of British Indian soldiers. As your Highness is aware, within the last six months His Majesty’s Consulate in [2173 a —6]Seistan lias on two separate occasions been attacked by the populace of Nasratabad. On the first occasion the dispensary belonging to the Consulate was wrecked, and His Majesty’s Consul and other members of his staff were stoned by Persian subjects. No adequate satisfaction has hitherto been given by the Persian Government for these attacks, and the principal offenders are, as far as I am aware, still at large and unpunished. I am now instructed by His Majesty’s Government to inform your Highness, in reply to your communication, that the cases referred to contained arms and ammunition necessary for the protection of His Majesty’s Consulate.Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

SINCE writing my despatch No. 233 of the 3rd instant I have received from the / Persian Government the note, translation of which I have the honour to inclose, on the subject of the importation of arms destined for His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed. I have already transmitted to your Lordship the substance of the inclosed note in my telegram No. 142 of the 5th instant. Your Lordship will perceive that the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, as before, declines to sanction the importation of the arms in question on the ground that such a concession might cause the failure of negotiations stated to be in progress to induce the Russian Government to remove certain arms forcibly brought by them into Persia some months ago. I ventured to express the opinion in my telegram No. 142 that the Russian Government were unlikely to consent to remove their arms or the Persian Government to sanction the importation of arms for the use of His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Meshed. In a town like Meshed, which is full of fanatics over whom the Government has no efficient control, it is evident that British subjects should have some means of defending themselves if attacked. As I have frequently had the honour to report, the starving and ill-clad horde of tatterdemalions, which constitute the so-called Persian army, would, in case of an attack on the Christians, be the first to butcher us, if it were in any way their interest to do so. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUPE. Inclosure in No. 1. Mushir-ed-Dowleh to Mr. E. Grant Duff. (Translation.) November 3, 1905. IN reply to your note of the 21st ultimo, respecting the permission for the import of arms and ammunition for the British Consulate-General at Meshed, I ha\c the honour to inform you that the Persian Government are negotiating with the Russians respecting the previous case, and should the Persian Government grant the permission now asked for by the British Government, the negotiation in question will have no result. I have no doubt that, in view of the friendship existing between the two Govern ments, the British authorities will not insist in the matter, which would frustrate the measures taken by the Persian Government in its own interests.

As regards the supply of arms and ammunition for His Majesty’s Consulate Sir E. Grey agrees that they should he sent to Nasratabad as soon as pos sible. He sees however no reason to modify the views expressed in my letter 16276 of May 15th last regarding the entry of British troops into Persia. He would deprecate this step unless absolutely neces sary for the protection of His Majesty's Consul, as i likely to offend Persian and Russian susceptibili ties, to form an undesirable precedent for similar action on the part of Russia in the future, to pro voke local animosity and to diminish the responsi bility of the Persian Authorities for the maintenance of security and order. He would therefore sug gest, for Mr. Morley's consideration, that the arms should if possible be introduced under the escort of levies, whose movements on the frontier do not at tract undue attention, to whom might be attached the ten sowars to be added to the Consular escort.■As regards the telegraph extension to Seistan Sir E.

Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, forwarding copy of a telegram from the Government of India relative to the situation in Seistan. British force at Robat should, in certain eventualities, be sent to Nasratabad. He is, however, of opinion that the entry of British troops into Persia would be likely to give rise to difficulties both of a local and general nature, and should, if possible, be avoided. As regards the question of punishing the persons concerned in the recent riots, it appears to Sir E. Grey doubtful whether the Persian forces on the spot, which were admittedly unequal to protecting the European residents during the disorders, could now punish the rioters or cope with further rioting which an attempt to do so might provoke. He does not, however, see any objection to adopting the suggestion of the Government of India that the local rank of Vice-Consul should be granted to Dr. Watson.

The following instructions are being sent to Grant Duff regarding affairs in Seistan :— Consul should be granted to Captain Watson, there is no objection, and you may take steps accordingly. As regards moving our troops to Nasratabad, this would be most undesirable, except for the purpose of affording protection. Strength of Persian Government to punish rioters locally, or to deal with further riots which might be provoked by attempt on their part at punishment, seems doubtful. It seems, therefore, advisable to wait till the official mentioned in your telegram of the 21st and further reinforcements arrive. On no account should w~e become involved in measures of punishment. Moreover, as riots appear from Macpherson’s report to have been directed primarily against the officers of the Belgian Customs, we have no wish to incur the whole of the odium involved in punishing the rioters.” PERSIA.

That reserve of arms and ammunition are required is clear from fact that they have been sent to Pobat, and Viceroy’s telegram No. 32, 34 F., dated 9th September 1905, to Secretary of State for India. I would venture to point out present is particularly favourable moment for importing them. My reasons for thinking so are as follows:— First .—If energetic action is taken by new official who has arrived here, it is possible that ringleaders of the riots of last March, some of whom are influential men, may work up an agitation against us, since action of Persian Government in investigating the affair is well known to be due to pressure brought to bear by us. Pecent disturbance reported in my telegram No. 340 C., dated 11th July 1906, though not very serious in itself, proves that ringleaders are sufficiently influential to effect this. In such a case reserve of arms and ammunition might be required. Secondly .—In view of fact that the Persian Govern ment have not yet taken steps to punish rioters of last March, that another disturbance has taken place, probably instigated by same men, and that under present circumstances some possibility of further trouble exists, our action in bringing in reserve of arms and ammunition could not be considered altogether unjustifiable. Moreover, I think it will be possible to get arms in without attracting attention, in which case question would not be raised.”From Viceroy, 18M July 1906.

An attack on British Consulate at night in town excited bv plague rioters is so serious a development, whatever may have been the motives of assailants, that we consider in addition to demand for apology of Persian Government and punishment of all persons concerned, necessity has been established for increasing strength of escort to that of Russians, and for placing adequate reserve of arms and ammunition in Consulate such as Russians were shown to possess in March riots. Military authorities question advisability sending arms with ten levies. We agree and propose to send fifty men of double company with British officer as escort to prevent risk of collision with Customs officials or mob. On arrival of Persian troops, arms escort would be withdrawn after raising Consular escort to strength of Russian guard, provided Persian troops showed that they are intended to maintain and are capable of maintaining order. The Chagai levies would remain until situation quiets down. Indeed, but for the presence of escort and levies, consequences of night attack on the Consulate might have been lamentable, as raiders only withdrew when guard fell in. We would again press for completion of telegraph to Seistan in view of serious position of affairs there. Russians now have five direct lines across Persian frontier.— wmmm©14 6 Secret Department. FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. From Viceroy, \Atth July 1906. Foreign Secret. Plague in Seistan. Following telegrams from Consul, Man, dated 10th July and llth July, repeated for information :— (1.) “ Persian official deputed to investigate disturbances of March last reinforcements of Persian troops, with guns and mounted men, are moving from Khorassan towards Seistan. As far as can be ascertained they number some three or four hundred men. “Deputy Governor has also come into Husseinabad, and is, for the first time, co-operating with Director of Customs. Steps are being taken to disinfect some of the houses in Husseinabad. “ It is rumoured here that the Persian Government intend inflicting summary punishment on the persons involved in the disturbances of March last. General feeling of unrest exists in Husseinabad owing to uncertainty as to how new official will act. Ringleaders of disturbances spreading rumours, which seem designed to reach my ears, that any attempt to implicate them will result in further disturbances. This action probably due to belief that we alone induced Persian Government to take energetic measures. As far as can be judged, anxiety is confined to those persons who have something to fear, and any disturbance which might occur would probably be entirely local in character. Addressed Foreign, 338 C. Repeated Tehran, 155, Meshed.” (2.) “ Last night, about midnight, a number of men, said to be inhabitants of Husseinabad, created a disturbance directed against this Consulate. Owing to the darkness it is impossible to obtain reliable information of their numbers, or identity, but there were probably some 10 or 12 persons. They were armed with sticks and, scaling the Consulate wall, maltreated some Consulate employes wdio, owing to the heat, happened to be sleeping outside. None of them, however, were more than slightly bruised. On the escort falling in, rioters bolted. Pursuit impossible owing to darkness. “ I wrote in strong terms to the Deputy Governor informing him of what had occurred and requesting him to take steps to protect Consulate. “ In my opinion, this disturbance was entirely artificial, and was worked up by the ringleaders of disturbances of March last for purposes of intimidation. Rumours referred to in my telegram, 338 C., 10th July, appear to have been well founded. In the first place, there was no excite ment in Husseinabad, or the city, as was the case in disturbances of March last. Secondly, rioters seem to have acted in accordance with preconcerted plan, as they chose lowest part of wall at a point as far distant as possible from the sentry’s beat. And, thirdly, whole incident had appearance rather of an organised demonstration against us than any spontaneous expression of feeling on the part of the people. There is no sign of any excitement to-day. “ Although present incident does not appear very serious in itself, it serves to indicate attitude likely to be adopted by the persons involved in the disturbances of March last. It is possible that nothing may happen ; it is also possible that the ringleaders of those disturbances, some of whom are very influential men, may succeed in working up an agitation against us, which, owing to lethargic attitude of Persian Government, we must look to our own resources to meet. Such an agitation, if it occurred at all, might occur any day, and I have accordingly ventured to assume responsibility of despatching some levies to Robat, under the command of Duffadar, Consulate escort, and have requested Officer Commanding Detachment at Robat to hand over to them spare arms and ammunition sent as Consulate reserve, which they will escort here. I trust this action may be approved. Addressed Foreign, 3i0 C. Repeated Tehran, 156, Meshed.” Our views will follow. reported to be within a few days’ march of Seistan.

I understand from Hughes that services of Hobat levies may be required on trade route. On reconsidering matter I am of opinion 'they could now be withdrawn with safety. PJague appears to be dying out, and likelihood of further disturbances therefore lessened. Arrival of troops in Robat has undoubtedly had effect on people here. Lastly, recent action of Deputy Governor in Bunjar incident has shown people that local authorities not always prepared to shield them. ‘‘I would, however, recommend that their withdrawal, whenever it may he effected, be made conditional on grant of certain concessions by Persian Government. Ihese might he, firstly, permission to bring in arms and ammunition now lying at Bohat, necessity for which has been amplv demonstrated; and, secondly, permission to increase strength of escort to 30 men. Having regard to what has occurred, Persian Government may find some difficulty in disputing our claim. As i egaids inciease of escort this would seem to be desirable now for several reasons. Strength of Russian escort is 30 men, and numerical inferiority of our escort has undoubtedly been noted by the people, and, in country where great importance attaches to military display, probably tends to increase their influence at our expense. Moreover, suggested increase may conceivably be necessary for the purpose of protection, since possibility of recurrence of plague and consequent likelihood of disturbances cannot be overlooked.” Owing to want of telegraphic communication between Rohat and Seistan, Daukes telegram only reached us on 8th instant, and was under consideration here.

In order to allay popular excitement at Nasratabad and opposition to Quarantine Begulations, I have, at the suggestion of His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan, proposed to the Persian Government that a prominent Mollah should be appointed both to the Tehran and to the Seistan Sanitary Councils. This would, I think, have the effect of reassuring the people and convincing them that there is nothing in the measures for combating the plague antagonistic to the Mahommedan religion. WITH reference to our conversation on the eveuing of Wednesday last, in regard to the riot at Nasratabad, I have the honour to inform you that the dispensary of His Majesty’s Consulate was practically destroyed by the populace on the 27th March, the damage including the furniture and outer doors of the hospital. In addition to Hr. Kelly and Captain Macpherson, who were struck by clods, the compounder of the dispensary received a severe contusion on the arm. I shall, on learning the details of the damage done by the mob to the property of His Majesty’s Government or to property belonging to British subjects, prefer a claim for the amount against the Persian Government. I learn from a report received yesterday evening from Seistan that great excitement still prevails at Nasratabad, where the Governor, in spite of his good intentions, seems powerless to deal with the populace. His Majesty’s Consul considers the situation dangerous, and I need hardly impress on your Excellency the necessity of dealing effectually and promptly with if.

Sir, Tehran, April 26, 1906. WITH reference to your telegrams Nos. 54 and 62 of the 7th and 19th instant, I Government on the subject of the recent disturbances at Nasratabad, Seistan. So far as I am aware, the Persian Government have, up to the present, made no attempt to arrest the persons who instigated, or were concerned in, the riot. The Deputy-Governor and most of the other local officials, together with the soldiers garrisoning Nasratabad, would appear to have left the town, and on Tuesday the Mushir-ed-Dowleh informed me that the Frontier Officer, Itisham-ul-Yezareh, had telegraphed to him, briefly stating that he was tired of Seistan and had left for Tehran. A special official, named Momtahen-es-Saltaneh, has been ordered to proceed with ail dispatch to Seistan, but I gather from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh that it will be very difficult to persuade him to leave Tehran. In order to allay popular excitement at Nasratabad and opposition to Quarantine Regulations, I have, at the suggestion of His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan, proposed to the Persian Government that a prominent Mollah should be appointed both to the Tehran and to the Seistan Sanitary Councils. This would, I think, have the effect of reassuring the people and convincing them that there is nothing in the measures for combating the plague antagonistic to the Mahommedan religion. You will see that in his note of the 17th instant the Mushir-ed-Dowleh again declines to sanction the linking-up of Kuh-i-Malik Siah and Nasratabad by a telegraph line. The Persian Cossacks destined to enforce quarantine in Seistan are stated to be leaving here to-day. WITH reference to our conversation on the evening of TV ednesday last, in regard to the riot at Nasratabad, I have the honour to inform you that the dispensary ot His Majesty’s Consulate was practically destroyed by the populace on the 27th March, the damage including the furniture and outer doors of the hospital. In addition to Dr. Kelly and Captain Macpherson, who were struck by clods, the compounder of the dispensary received a severe contusion on the arm. I shall, on learning the details of the damage done by the mob to the property of His Majesty’s Government or to property belonging to British subjects, prefer a claim for the amount against the Persian Government. I learn from a report received yesterday evening from Seistan that great excitement still prevails at Nasratabad, where the Governor, in spite of his good intentions, seems pow T erless to deal with the populace. His Majesty’s Consul considers the situation dangerous, and I need hardly impress on your Excellency the necessity of dealing effectually and promptly with it. I should be obliged if you would kindly let me know, as soon as possible, what steps are being taken to protect His Majesty’s Consulate and to punish Hie persons guilty of the attack on Captain Macpherson, his staff, and on the Consular dispensary. have the honour to transmit herewith copies of correspondence with the Persian I have, &amp;c.

(Translation.) April 2, 1906. HIS Majesty’s Consul in Seistan reports that the situation at Nasratabad is asrain very serious, and that the Mollahs of that town intend to demand certain concessions, which, if not granted, they propose to enforce. I am confident that the Persian Government are doing, and will continue to do, all they can to protect the British subjects resident in Nasratahad, and it is scarcely necessary for me to point out to your Excellency the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to the speedy restoration of order in Seistan and to the punishment of the persons implicated in the attack on His Majesty’s Consul and the Consulate dispensary. I HAVE the honour to inform you that details of the recent riot in Nasrataharl, involving an attack on His Majesty’s Consul and the destruction of the Consular dispensary, have been laid before His Majesty’s Government. 1 am instructed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to impress upon your Excellency the gravity of the situation in Seistan, and to state that the Persian Government will he held responsible for any damage which may thereby accrue to the lives and properly of British subjects resident in that province. In view of the necessity which recent events in Seistan have more than ever demonstrated for the establishment of direct telegraphic communication between Nasratabad and Kuh-i-Malik Siah, I am directed again to draw your Excellency’s attention to the urgency of permission being granted for the immediate construction of the line in question. HIS Majesty’s Consul in Seistan informs me that the Deputy-Governor of Uiat province has left Nasratabad, and is living in a place some 4 miles from the town. Owing to the prevailing floods, communication with him is almost impossible. In view of the serious condition of Nasratabad and the prevailing plague epidemic, I am confident that your Excellency will agree with me that the absence of the principal civil authority is most undesirable, and I hope that the Persian Government will see their way to order him to return at once. I may add, for your Excellency’s information, that the Deputy-Governor would appear to have received no orders to take steps for the punishment of the persons concerned in the recent outrage on His Majesty’s Consul and the destruction of the Consular dispensary. 1 HAVE received your note of the 14th instant, informing me that the Deputy- Governor is staying about half a farsakhoutof the town of Nasratabad. I telegraphed to him at once to return to town without delay. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. E. Grant Duff to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. (Translation.) April 8, 1906. Inclosure 4 in No. 1. Mr. E.

April 17, 1906.You inquired as to the punishment of those concerned in interfering with the dispensary of the British Consulate. I have the honour to point out that at such a moment, when the public agitation lias been the cause of this movement and when the present condition of the place requires much sympathy and consideration, the punishment of these people is not advisable, and I have no doubt that you will agree with me in this point. Inclosure 6 in No. 1. Mushir-ed-Dowleh to Mr. E. Grant Duff. (Translation.) April 17, 1906. I HAVE received your note of the 8th instant, respecting the public agitation in Seistan, and I have the honour to state, for your information, that on receipt of this news strong telegraphic orders were sent, and the local authorities took energetic measures for the suppression of the riot and agitation, and order -was restored. Subsequently the necessary instructions and stringent orders were sent to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and I hope the public agitation will not be renewed. You again mentioned the telegraph extension to Kuh-i-Malik Siah. For the reasons frequently mentioned to you, the Persian Government do not consider it advisable to take any measure in connection with it. Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Mr. E. Grant Duff to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. (Translation.) April 20, 1906. YOU informed me yesterday that, in view of the state of Nasratabad, the Persian Government were unable for the present to take steps to arrest and punish the ringleaders in the recent attack on His Majesty’s Consul, or those concerned in the destruction of the Consular dispensary. I have had the honour, on more than one occasion, to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government had no desire to cause the Persian Government embarras- ment by insisting on the arrest of the offenders before a reasonable time had elapsed since the incidents of the 27th ultimo. It is, however, now over three weeks since the riot, and His Majesty’s Consul reports that the Deputy-Governor has not only taken no steps to apprehend and punish the delinquents, but has left the town for a place which, owing to the prevailing floods, is nearly inaccessible. I am convinced that your Excellency will appreciate the gravity of the offence committed against His Majesty’s Consul, and the impossibility of allowing matters to remain in their present state. I have to-day received instructions to urge the Persian Government to consider the necessity of taking early measures to punish the rioters. The failure to do this would, in Sir Edward Grey’s opinion, prove that the Persian Government are unable to afford His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan proper protection, and w ould compel His Majesty’s Government to take steps accordingly.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [16428] Mr. K. Grant Duff to Sir Edward ('May 14.] Section 10 . Grey.—[Received May 14.) (No. 117.) Sir, ^ Tehran, April 25, 1906. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copies of two despatches* addressed to the Government of India by His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan regarding the recent riots at Nasratebad (Seistan). I also inclose copy of a note to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, informing his Excellency of the names, as far as they have at present been ascertained, of the ringleaders in the disturbances. I have made it quite clear to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh that it is the duty of the Persian Government and not of His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan to discover and punish the persons instigating and concerned in the riot, and that my furnishing the names, as far as they are known to us, is a mere act of courtesy. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUFF. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Macpherson to Government of India. (Confidential.) Sir, Seistan, March 29, 1906. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a Report on the riots in Seistan, of the occurrence of which you have been previously advised by my telegrams of the 27th and 28th March respectively. 2. On the 26th March the huts for the reception of plague cases from the city were completed, and arrangements were made with M. Cattersel that Hospital Assistant Shaik Ahmad, with the Malik-ul-Hakuma, should proceed to the city on tne morning of the 27th a nil endeavour to indu ce the relatives of the sick to allow of their removal to hospital. At 1*30 p.m., Hospital Assistant Shaik Ahmad brought a message from M. Cattersel to the effect that he himself would accompany the two native doctors, that he had written a letter to M. Zaplotynsky asking him to be present, and that he also desired Captain Kelly’s presence. I immediately proceeded to the Customs office, accompanied by Captain Kelly, and pointed out the inadvisability of allowing Europeans to assist on this occasion, as the people would probably be excited, and would in all probability resent the presence of Europeans, that it was absolutely necessary that no display of force be made, if it was desired that the people should have confidence in the hospital, otherwise subsequent cases would be concealed, and that the chance of a disturbance would be reduced to a minimum if the removal were carried out entirely by the native doctors. M. Cattersel finally agreed, and Hospital Assistant Shaik Ahmad was instructed to co-operate with the Persian doctor, and commence removing the sick on the following morning. 3. On the morning of the 27 th two cases of plague were brought to the hospital, the relatives being quite willing that they should be treated there, but the third house which was visited contained a female patient whose relatives objected to her removal. Shaik Ahmad endeavoured to persuade them, but as they remained firm he desisted, and left tlurugase. Mirza Sadik Khan, of the Customs Department, however, declined to leave the case, and endeavoured to remove the woman by force. Shaik Ahmad then, leaving the vicinity, went to the house of the Persian doctor, and very shortly afterwards an excited crowd collected in front of this house. He and the Malik spoke to the [1990 o—10J * Later despatch not printed. B2 people, and told them if they had any grievance, that they should proceed to the Customs office.* 4. About this time news of a disturbance in the city reached the Consulate, and I ’ saw Shaik Ahmad, accompanied by a large crowd, leave the gate of the city. Shaik Ahmad and the better dressed people in the mob proceeded to the Customs office while the remainder, in all about 250 persons, came in the direction of the plague huts* .’S which are situated about 150 yards from the Consulate Hospital. I at once gave orders for the escort to fall in, and, accompanied by Captain Kelly, proceeded to the Consulate Hospital, which, owing to its proximity to the plague huts, would probably invite the attention of the mob, and as it is outside the high wall surrounding the Consulate there was nothing to prevent the people entering and destroying the place. On arriving at the hospital I spoke to one of the rioters, and he informed me that the people had no cause ol complaint against the Consulate, but that they objected to their sick beina- removed to the Plague Hospital, and to their women being examined ; he also stated that a corpse of a Mahommedan had been burnt that day by the Customs officers. 5. By this time the main crowd of the rioters had destroyed the plague huts, and weye returning to the city, the road passing in front of the Consulate Hospital. They appeared to be very excited, and as soon as they saw Captain Kelly and myself they commenced to shout, wave their sticks, and throw lumps of hardened mud in our direction ; the people who^vere close to us appeared to be better disposed, and endeavoured to prevent this hostile demonstration, but their efforts were futile, and the rioters came on with a rush. We withdrew inside the Consulate wall, and while doing so I was struck on the arm, Captain Kelly was struck on the shoulder, Jemadar Fazal Rahaman was struck on the arm, as was also the compounder of the hospital. The crowd then entered the hospital and destroyed most of the furniture and all the medicines which happened to be on the shelves. They also endeavoured to burst in the door leading to the Consulate grounds, and one man climbed partly over the wall. He was warned that if he came any farther he would be shot, and a pistol was discharged over his head, where upon he retired, and the crowd withdrew. 6. When passing the main entrance to the Consulate, on their way back to the city, the crowd halted and threw stones at the gate, but they did not attempt to climb the walls at this place ; they then proceeded towards the Customs office, and as Hospital Assistant Shaik Ahmad was last seen going in that direction I went there with the escort. On the way we passed through the mob, some of whom were well-disposed, and cleared a way for us, but others in the background threw pieces of brick and sticks in our direction, none of which, however, did any harm. On arriving at the Customs office I found that the Russian Consul with a party of Cossacks had already arrived there, and they had not been in any way molested by the crowd. Shaik Ahmad was also here, and he had suffered no ill-treatment, but Mirza Saclik Khan had been badly beaten, and his clothes had been torn off by the mob. Both M. Nekrassof and M. Cattersel were convinced that the riot was caused by the Persian doctor and the telegraph master, and while discussing the event a letter was received by M. Nekrassof. He informed us that it contained news that emissaries had been sent to Bunjar, and that the people of Bunjar were coming in to attack the Russian Consulate. 7. I then returned to the Consulate, taking Shaik Ahmad with me, and proceeded to put the place in a state of defence. There were in all fifteen men of the escort and four British officers available, about twenty Afghans, who happened to be in the city, also came and offered their services. These men were divided up and posted to different positions, a few being armed with spare rifles and shot guns belonging to the officers, and the remainder were supplied with sticks. The gates were strengthened, but the perimeter of the Consulate is so extensive that it would not have been possible to hold the outer wall if the place were attacked in force. The people remained in a very excited state all day, and a Majilis was held which lasted well on into the night; they were all sworn on the Koran that they would join forces with the inhabitants of the surrounding towns and attack the Customs office in the morning, as the ill-feeling appears to be principally directed against the Belgian officers. 8. The inhabitants of the Consulate remained on the alert all night, but no disturbance took place. Early in the morning a letter was received from the Deputy- Governor, in reply to one which I had previously written him warning him of his responsibilities. He informed me that he had sent men to Bunjar and to the * Vule Shaik Ahmad’s Report, attached.3 surrounding towns, and that he hoped lie would be able to prevent a renewal of the disturbances. 9. On the 28th the people remained in a very excited condition, and I heard that rumours were being spread to the effect that a corpse had been exhumed by the Customs Department, and that the medicines which had been given to the people had poisoned them. I also heard that some of the people object to being treated by Shaik Ahmad. In the afternoon the Deputy-Governor paid me a visit, and after expressing his regret at the occurrences of yesterday, he inspected the wrecked hospital ; but although he was willing to admit that the attack was entirely unprovoked, he stated that he did not think it advisable to arrest the ringleaders at present, as he had not sufficient force at his disposal to cope w r ith an extensive riot, involving the surrounding towns ; he promised, however, to collect his men, and when he has a force sufficiently strong to punish the leaders. 10. Strong parties were again posted at the different gates during the night, and the Consulate remained in a state of siege. 11. On the 29th, as the plague is spreading rapidly, the Mullahs decided to sacrifice a goat, and this animal was accordingly led round the city, accompanied by a large crowd with a band and some banners. The}’ were rot actively hostile, although they passed close to the Consulate. 12. Towards midday a mob was observed approaching from the direction of Bunjar; they were met by the Must oh, whom at first they treated with contempt, but he was backed up by some of the Mullahs, who persuaded the Syeds to depute a small number of their leading men to go into the city and lay their grievances before the Deputy- Governor. 13. The Mustofi subsequently came and reported to me that the grievances of the Bunjaris were as follows :— (1.) That Sultan Mahomed, a British trader, who had given religious abuse on the day of the riot, was to be expelled the country or handed over to them for punishment. (2.) That Sadik Khan, the Customs Mirza, and Hospital Assistant Shaik Ahmad 1 had stripped and examined women at Daudi, and had burnt a Koran amongst the effects j of an infected person. (3.) That the Belgians should be prohibited from any interference in plague work, which the people would carry out themselves. (4.) That the practice of Seistanis being employed as news-writers by the Russians and British was to be prohibited. (5.) That a written agreement was to be taken that none of the rioters of the first day were to be punished. 13. The Mustofi, after assuring me that we had nothing to fear, as the people were really excited only against the Belgians—the attack on our hospital having been an unpremeditated act, subsequently much regretted by the people—rejoined the Deputy- Governor at the telegraph office. 14. During the course of the afternoon the crowds gradually dispersed, and by evening all seemed quiet. 15. I should have mentioned that on the first day after the attack on the hospital, and when our position seemed critical, as emissaries had then been sent to all the surrounding villages to stir up the people, and there was every probability of a general rising, I sent an urgent message to Mr. Hughes, A.D.S.P., at Robat requesting him to bring up with the least possible delay the reserve of levies at that post to reinforce the Consulate guard. I ventured to take the above responsibility on myself, as a delay of at least three days would have occurred had I first telegraphed for sanction to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and at least six days in the event of a reference being made to the Govern ment of India. Owing to two sowars of the Consulate escort having accompanied Captain Keyes, and two more being on duty at Lutak in charge of the grain dep6t there, while a fifth was sick, only one Jemadar and fourteen men remained at my disposal here with a total of less than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, and this force was altogether inadequate for the situation which then threatened. I trust therefore that my action, which seemed a most necessary and justifiable precaution to take, will not meet with disapproval. J(5. With reference to the allusions in mv telegrams regarding the Russians being instigators of the riot, a number of facts pointing to this conclusion have come ~ !1990 0—10] B 2»'■ l ’ ; —- 4 to my notice, but as I do not wish to delay this Report, and as the post is about to leave this matter will be made the subject of a separate report. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. D. MACPHERSON, Captain, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain. c Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Hospital Assistant Shaik Ahmad's Statement. ON the morning of the 27th March, the day on which the disturbances took place, by order of the Sanitary Commission I went to the city with Sadik Khan (the Customs’ Mirza) to try to induce certain persons who were ill of the plague, and their relatives, &amp;c., to leave their homes and go into a small segregation camp which had been erected for them near the British Consulate Hospital. We induced some six persons to go to the segregation camp (one of whom was actually ill of the plague) without much difficulty and without any opposition. I then suggested to Sadik Khan that we should visit the Persian doctor, and ask him to co-operate with us; he, however, wished to see one other plague case first, and we accordingly did so. This case was that of a woman sick of the plague, but unwilling to leave her home, and her son (a young man about 22 years of age) coming in shortly after our arrival also refused to let her go. Sadik Khan pressed her, and seemed ready tc resort to force if she persisted in her refusal. In view of my instructions, which forbade me to even approach anything in the nature of compulsory measures, I did not feel justified in pressing the woman further, and, leaving Sadik Khan with the woman, went to the house of the Persian doctor which was close by. When I left no people had collected, and the only persons in the house were Sadik Khan, the ill woman, one son aged about 22 years, two younger sons, and one other man. Sadik Khan and the elder son were arguing somewhat acrimoniously. I found the Persian doctor in, and remained with him talking and smoking for about one hour, we then heard a hubbub outside, and the servants informed us that a disorderly crowd had collected with grievances concerning the measures taken to suppress the plague. The Persian doctor instructed them to admit one or two of the leading men, who could act as spokesmen ; several were admitted. They stated that the disease in the city was not plague, but was some other epidemic to which they were periodically susceptible, and in any case they objected to force being used to compel them to leave their homes. The Persian doctor replied that the question of plague was one he and myself were competent to decide, and that any grievance they had should be laid before the President of the Sanitary Committee. He declared himself ready to accompany them at once to the Customs house, and we accordingly went there. On our way we heard a good deal of noise proceeding from the house of the sick woman, with whom I had left Sadik Khan, and I understood that he had been trying to forcibly disinfect the house. A section ot the crowd, accompanied by myself and the Persian doctor, proceeded to the Customs house, the rest branched off towards the British Consulate. I was not present when Sadik Khan was beaten, though I heard about it later. The crowd did not attempt to molest me or the Persian doctor. In reality the crowd originally consisted of a number of persons who intended to lay their complaints quietly before the Persian doctor, but while on their way to his house happened on a further case of “ zulm ” in the shape of Sadik Khan trying to forcibly disinfect the above- mentioned woman’s house, which so inflamed them that they got entirely out of hand.

THE Meftah-es-Saltaneh recently inquired on behalf of your Excellency, whether I could lurnish him with the names of the ringleaders in the attack on His Majesty’s Consulate on the 27th ultimo. The names of the persons are, as far as have been ascertained, as follows :— 1. Mullah Mahomed Taki. 2 . Mullah Mahomed Hussein. 3. Haji Khorashadi. 4. Hassan Khorashadi. 5. Mahomed Hussain, of Ney. 6 . Mujtehif Shaikh Reza. I may add that Haji Khorashadi, and Hassan Khorashadi were actually present when the dispensary was wrecked. In sending the names of these persons to your Excellency I desire to make it quite clear that my doing so is a mere act of courtesy, and that it is no part of the duty of either His Majesty’s Legation or of His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan to identify the instigators of the recent riot. The duty to arrest and punish these offenders rests, as your Excellency is of course aware, with the Persian Government, who are doubtless giving the matter their serious consideration.Confidential.

In your telegram No 96, you appe^ar to deprecate despatch of small British foice to Seistan, and to send large force would he likely to cause complications. You should continue to urge Persian Government ty'adopt necessary punitive measures, infoimiing them that their failure to do so would prove that they are unable to afford piopei protection to H.tlf. Consul in Seistan and would compel H.M. Government to take steps accordingly. r f j- f°\ ' j4 - COiNl'JDKXTJAl CLnxJdti urjL • Mr. Grant Duff to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 15, 7-30 p.m.) ^°‘ T r^iTTXT^ r ^ Tehran, April 15, 1906, 9*30 a.m. 1 0LL0A\ IISG from Consul at Seistan, 13th April Although no further disturbances have taken place here, situation still most unsatisfactory, there are no officials left with whom to transact business. Our traders are subjected to petty annoyances. Custom-house servant and British trader alleged to have given relief [group undecypherable] [see my telegram of 29th March] are unable to leave premises of custom-house and Consulate respectively, owing to fear of assault, and generally there is no security. Russians meanwhile remain in constant communication with ringleaders, and, as far as [? possible], are endeavouring to incite them further. Information of riot at Meshed has also reached people, and 'is causing some excitement.. 1 he longer we remain inactive now the more our prestige will sunei, and I a enture to think, therefore, either our troops should march straight in here to restore ordei, oi lersian Government should be given due [group omitted V notice! that abo\e course will be adopted unless our demands for punishment are complied with within a fixed period, which should be short. It is already seventeen days since riot occurred. at i ^ (^, dressed t0 Tehran, No. 102 ; sent to India, Xo. 221; repeated to Vicerov and Meshed.) Mushir-ed-Dowleh has telegraphed ordering Deputy Governor to return to Nasiatabad. His Excellency states that Persian Government cannot punish ring leaders until town is again normal. As nearly three weeks have elapsed since the riot, J suggest that in a week from to-day, if the Persian Government have done nothing, I should be authorized to inform them that unless adequate steps are taken to punish ringleaders, British troops will be sent to protect Consulate. I venture to remind you that this is the fourth British officer who has been attacked during the last year and a-half. ^ Persian Government have as yet not punished assailants, and effect on our prestige is simply deplorable. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to India, Meshed, and Seistan.)CONFIDENTIAL. Mr. Grant Duff to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 14, 2‘30 p.m.j (No. 103.) Tehran, April 14, 1906, 10‘50 a.m. FOLLOWING from Consul at Seistan, No. 101, 12tli April:— “ Deputy Governor appears to have received no orders yet to make arrests, and certainly will not move in the matter without extreme pressure, as it is practically certain that he and the Mustaufi are at the bottom of the whole agitation as previously reported. 1 would suggest, therefore, that he be ordered to return to city at once and to remain there until the business is settled. He is living at present 4 miles outside the city, and, owing to flood, communication with him is almost impossible. He declines to come to see me, and I have not time to go to see him. As he is in great terror of plague, nothing will conduce speedier settlement than if he is obliged to remain in the city until it is effected. “ (Addressed to Tehran and sent to India; repeated to Foreign Office, with Viceroy’s [? telegram], and Meshed.) ” I have replied as follows :— “ Your telegram No. 101. “ His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that it is premature to demand punish ment and compensation before state of things is again normal and danger of further rioting over. Meanwhile, I have impressed on Persian Government gravity of the situation, for which they will be held responsible, and I am again asking for telegraphic [? instructions]. “ I have asked Persian Govermnent to order return of Governor. “ (Addressed to Seistan ; sent to India, Foreign Office, and Meshed.)”DRAFT TELEGRAM.From Viceroy t 4&lt;th April 1906. Foreign Secret. Seistan disturbances. Following telegrams from Consul are repeated for information :— “ 30th March. Situation much quieter. Mons. Cattersel informs me that during threatened disturbance yesterday Russians turned out 150 armed men; this included large number of Baluchis. Rifles appeared to be all of same pattern, and there was reserve of 50,000 rounds of ammunition.” “ 31st March. Situation again very serious, and there is undoubted possibility of real trouble. Latest information is that Mullahs intend to demand certain concessions which, if not granted, they will enforce. I shall temporise as much as possible, but I hope that orders will be sent to troops on the way up to move up with all despatch. Camels, with reserve supplies for double company, should be also ordered to stand fast at Robat, as they may be required to transport supplies to Seistan. I would also suggest that arrangements be considered for immediate despatch of further reinforcements in case of necessity. Russians have given out that 600 Cossacks are coming, but this may be bluff.” Agent to Governor-General, Baluchistan, telegraphs that Hughes reached Girde, half-way between Robat and Nasratabad, on the 31st March, all well. He should have reached Nasratabad on 3rd April. With reference to foregoing messages, I propose to approve action taken by Consul. Arms will be sent on to him with small escort as soon as possible. Question of sending whole of double company to Seistan will be considered with reference to situation existing there on their arrival at Robat. Military authorities are being consulted as to this, and on Consul’s proposals for detaining camels at Robat, and his suggestion for further reinforcements. If Russians, as stated by Reuter 2nd April, are com plaining of failure of quarantine and extension of plague, services of double company might be offered to Persian Government to assist their authorities in maintenance of order and carrying out such arrangements as are possible for prevention of spread of plague, with due regard, as in India, to customs and prejudices of the people of country, as to which our medical officers can advise from experience gained here. If Persian Government decline offer. I propose to send double company without further parley if situation critical. It seems also desirable to press for immediate completion of telegraph line, Seistan, as present break in communication might be dangerous.

Continuation of my telegram of 30th ultimo. Officer commanding detachment en route, Robat, has already been instructed not to cross frontier without direct order from Government of India, except in the case of extreme urgency of which Consul on spot must judge. These instructions will be repeated as it seems unlikely that Consulate will be attacked. See following telegram from Grant Duff to Seistan: “ March 28th. Riot in Seistan. Saw Mushir-ed-Dowleh at once on receiving news, and he telegraphed in my presence to Governor-General, Khorasan and Seistan, authority to protect British Consulate. Despatch of troops from Robat will give offence here. Addressed Foreign Office; sent to India, Seistan.” From Viceroy, 1st April 1906. • Foreigh Secret. Seistan disturbances. My telegram of yesterday. Following information now received from Macpherson, Seistan. On morning of 27th riot occurred owing to plague measures. Crowd wrecked dispensary and clods struck Consul and Consulate doctor. Immediate cause was attempt of Customs official to remove plague patient to hospital by force, contrary to advice of Consul. Russians attribute movement to propaganda of recentlv arrived Persian doctor. Consul thinks that it is due to want of tact of Cattersel, Customs officer, and inspection of women by Russian doctor, and Russian instigation. As night attack on Consulate was threatened Macpherson asked Assistant Superintendent of Police at Robat to move to Seistan with available Chagai Militia sowars. Hughes accordingly left for Seistan with twenty-three sowars on 30th March. No attack was delivered up to morning of 28th on Consulate, which has been reinforced by all available Afghans, but arms have unfortunately not reached Robat, afternoon. Deputy-Governor is doing his best to quiet populace, and Consul has agreed to his deferring any arrests of rioters for the present till things quiet down.DRAFT TELEGRAM.
