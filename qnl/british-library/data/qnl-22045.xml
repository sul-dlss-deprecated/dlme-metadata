This will give the Shaikh an opportunity of considering the matter and if he does not wish a separate call paid,he can always reply that Shaikh Salman will be with him. 2. I understand that a variety of people have offered to act as go-betweens between Shaikh Salman and His Excellency Shaikh Hamad,with a view to putting forward his candidature to the Shaikhdom. Shaikh Salman has wisely said he will do his own approaching of the Buler on this subject.. 3. The file should accompany me to Bushire* 7-3-1933.On the 22nd March 1933 His Excellency Shaikh Hamad came on a visit to see a new hook on 'Hawking” which I had got from London. At the end I asked him for a private f t iQ. word (Mr.Belgrave was present and st'ay^d - irT^L’he' roonj) and said that I should shortly he writing to him asking when and where it would he convenient for him to receive my *Id call. I said that in the past Shaikh Salman had always been with him hut as he was now the eldest son of the Ruler,it would he appropriate if I were to pay a call on him at his own house. I said,however,that if I did so people might consider that Government was recognising him as the Heir and that it would he well if he (Shaikh Hamad) would think it over and let me know in due course what he wanted. He at once said that it would he very nice if I would call on Shaikh Salman,hut clearly he had not thought about the subject so I asked him to let me know later on. 2. This will give him an opportunity of saying that Shaikh Salman will be with him as usual,supposing that he thinks that a special call is inadvisable for the present. 23-3-1933.(9 COI'IFIOaiT'JIAL. A.P. A. I understand that the Sunni Qadhis requested the Shia*ah Qadhis to appoint a time for convening a meeting in connection with the appointment of an heir apparent for H*B*Shaikh Sir Hamad. It is said that most of the people are in favour of Shaikh i Salman bin Hamad. Further developements will be reported as to the result of the meeting, if held. Vc © Confident ial Tne Residency Busnire, tne 30tn December, 1937 D.O.No.908-S / if Could you please refer to correspondence ending witn my telegram No.1194 of tne 30tn December 1937. compelled to accept tne invitation from Ibn Saud, and thus to make a somewhat arduous overland journey in his present state of health* will run risks of not surviving the overland journey, and this risk brings to a head a matter which I nave had on my mind for some time i* e. what is going to happen when the Shaikh does actually die, either in the course of the next few months, or &lt;] the next few years. 4. as you know, Arabs do not generally recognise primo geniture though tn^y do insist that the successor to a Shaikh must come from the Shaikhly family. Beyond this it is simply a case of the beet man winning, by getting the strongest party in the State on his side. Sometimes he succeeds by bloodshed (tile famous Muoarak, of Kuwait, killed two of Ms hrottiers in one night],and sometimes by a mere show of force as in the case of the present Shaikh of Sharjan when ne deposed nis relative Khalid. 8 ' In Salman is the eldest son, but is ne likely to succeed, or will another member of the Family probably 2 . It is unfortunate that the Shaikh has found himself 3 Even if accompanied by a medical attendant the Shaikh H* Afeightm&amp;n, Ssquire, Political Agent, Bahrain put /Rll-MHP- 1 -' put himself on the throne ? And is there likely to be any sort of open strife ? 6* The policy of the Government of India* and of hie Majeety , s Government* in the Gulf is* for sound reasons, not to recognise beforehand- any successor to a Shaikh, and though we departed from the practice in Q,atai it was for the special reason of inducing the Shaikh to give an oil concession in the right direction* In Bahrain, however, we nave recognised nobody as successor, nor has the Shaikh asked us to do so. 7* I like Abdullah bin Isa personally* and on various occasions ne has rendered us assistance e*g. in helping Belgrave to acquire the lam lor the naval base, and in connection with the transit dues negotiations with the Saudi delegation* I seem to remember also Belgrave telling me that ne - Abdullah - adopted a sensible attitude to the claims of the Bahama to better treatment* Salman, on the other hand, is lively to be more amenable to our influence, but would not be such a strong ruler, and I have a personal predilection for a Shaikh who can stand on his own legs* The young Abdullah I do not know much about* In your reply to my letter please include a short career and character sketch of these three individuals, with ages etc. .Vhich of these three do you think has the most popular support in Bahrain ? I presume there is no other likely candidate ? Bearing the above considerations in mind, when the shaikh does die what part, if any, do you think we ought to play in getting any particular individual made Shaikh ? It may well be that we should play no part at all. *The best work of a Political Officer-is very often what he n&amp;s left % undone*'* ,V q certainly do not want to pursue the injudiciouspolicy we nave adopted in otner parts of Asia of setting up a puppet Ruler* whom we nave then to support on the throne against popular feeling. 9 0 Please talk the matter over confidentially with Belgrave and let me nave your views ag soon as you conveniently can* I will then write to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government giving my views and getting from them some idea of the line we should adopt when the eventuality under considera tion occurs©Confidential , O.O.No.C/lS-l.a/16 The 6th January 1938• / L Please refer to your demi-official letter tfo. 908-S dated the 30th December 1937 on the subject of the Bahrain Succession* 2* Everyone, including Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman, did his best to dissuade His Highness from accepting Bin Saud’s invitation to return overland, but the old man was hopelessly stubborn and would not move an inch* 3, As you say, there is a fairly considerable possibili ty that the succession will open in the near future, and an immediate report on the questions that you have raised seems necessary, though there will not be time to prepare dossiers of Abdullah bin T Isa, Salman bin Hamad and the younger Abdul lah before I leave for Qatar* These will follow by the next mail* 4* 1 have had a Ion r talk with Belgrave and even he, with so long and intimate an acquaintance with evei'ycne in Bahrain, is r luctant to forecast what may happen if His Highness dies on the way back from the Haj. We both agree with you that the likely candidates are the three whom you name, though the young Abdullah is perhaps scarcely a serious candidate yet. In a few years he certainly will be, and if he develops as he promises, he will be a most desirable claimant too; but at present there is nsuffident serious support for him in the A1 Kha1ifoh Family. 5. Another outside chance is Shaikh lohammd bin 'Isa, but he need not be considered very seriously. His mother was/- '0 - 2 - vvas noo ox uhe blood 9 and he does little to increase his popularity by absenting himself from Bahrain almost all the time. The main point to note about him is that he may try to organise support in the Family for Salman against Abdullah, since the former’3 succession would obviously be less harmful to his personal prestige. 6 . Thus at present there are two candidates, Abdullah bin ’Isa and Salman. In the ordinary course of events His Highness should, when he feels his time is coning, nominate one ot then as his successor; and such a nomination should settle the matter since otherwise the scales ore fairly e/en oetween tne two. And here comes the first check to hopeful prophecy, sometimes dolman is in his father* s ''■■ood Docks and sometimes very much the reverse, and nomination by tne cld Shaikh on his death bed might easily be influen ced by some petty cause for annoyance given him by Salman. At present it seems Salman stands well with his father, and His Highness has, from his own share of the oil royal ties though at Belgrave*s suggestion, recently increased ^13 allowance. Consequently if His Highness begins to fail on the present KaJ it is quite possible that he will nomi nate oalman. It is nevertheless totally unpredictable -hot fie might do, and since it upsets him even to think of his own death no one has for years dared to put the subject to him, 7 . Apart from possible nomination, the betting is very even, with perhaps a. shade of odds on Abdullah bin ’Isa. The essential fact is that Abdullah appears to command ra ther more support in the Family than Salman. Outside the family, it seems possible that the Bahama would be with him against Salman who retains the old-fashioned idea UV t they/-they are no more than the servants or the slaves of the Ruling b amily 9 and. Is rather inclined, to be ,oo free with his opinion* As you remark, Abdullah has in recent years adopted a far more sensible attitude towards them* The majority of the Arab merchants will probably lean towards Salman, but they do not carry the weight they used to for T.he simple reason that they have not the money* Sut, as I have said, the essential factor is the Family, and though I accept Belgrave’s opinion that Abdullah should receive the backing of the majority, we cannot ignore the under currents, the strength of which it is so difficult to esti mate from one month to another. I find it equally diffi cult to estimate what effect the new wealth fron oil may have, out I have a sneaking feeling (not shared by telgrave) that this nay serve as a factor in Salman's favour. Every one knows that baXman is a. oit of a coward and fairly ea.si— ly stampeded| he may therefore appeal to some members of the Family as more easy than Abdullah to loot of a fat sha e of the oil royalties. wen so, if I am asked for a definite opinion, I should follow Belgrave and say that *odullah has (,1m probably pgnmtw following In the Family? he certainly hag o better brain and knows how to use it. aiyl I should expect him to succeed, 8. Neither Belgrave nor I feel that there is any vei’y great danger of disturbance on the supposition that the succession becomes open in the near future — certainly if Abdullah's star appears to be in the ascendant. I con fess I should not he quite so comfortable if Salman looked like succeeding; for I should not expect Abdullah to let that 12 lakhs slide out of his grasp without an effort though I believe he is wise and strong enough to prevent ©ny tiling/-anything in the nature of a rioting, ^'hether there might be a nasty accident in the Family is a different matter, though it is noteworthy that the Family has always been sin gularly free of 'accidents”. 9. Accepting the premise that Abdullah bin *Isa and Sal man are the only candidates to be considered, I do not consi der that there is any need whatever for us to attempt to wei ght the scales on either side. At the worst either of them would be a passable ruler, and either of them might develop really well. Abdullah obviously would not be so amenable and might want to strike out a line of his own, but he seems to have acquired plenty of ballast lately; he is undoubtedly capable and even in the present regime he Is the ultimate arbiter on many questions. Belgrave likes him well and I believe the liking is mutual, so T should not aporehend any sudden or violent changes either in policy or in the a dm in is-* trative svstem. Allowing that he will not be easily led, he should nevertheless be quite a desirable Shaikh. Salman would, as you say, be more amenable to influence, in fact very much a duplicate of his father. He is a nice little man whom I like, but for whose personality 1 cannot find much resnect. 10. Thus, quite apart from the point which you make and which in my opinion must in any event be decisive - that v^e cannot think of setting up a puppet ruler against popular feeling, there need oe no question of our backing either of the candidates. But even sc, if the succession opens without a nomination made by the present Ruler, I think we may have a part to play — in oiling the v/heels. In considering the part we should play we must clearly visualise who have the right to share in the selection of the next Shaikh. Obviously no foreigner (including ourselves) should come into it. Bin Baud/-I — Saud might try to exert some influence and we must do the best we can to prevent this, - not an easy task if His High ness dies in his territory with many of the family around him. The Bahama cannot, officially at any rate, be allowed any say whatsoever. The merchants too should not op nly be consulted, and as I have suggested, their underground power is probably not what it used to be. Officially the decision must and should rest with the A1 Khalifah Family alone and I consider that we should be prepared openly to assert this position. Let us assume His Highness dies without ranking any nomination. The Political Agent should at once arrange for a Council of He ency, if one is not already in existence, as there is at present under another name during His Highness* aosenee. He should then summon the whole Al K.halifah Family and after a short sermon, in which he will make it clear that His I ajesty *3 Government have no concern with the succes sion beyond requiring that the new Shaikh should honour the Treaties and Engagements of his predecessor, he should in vite them separately -and secretly to infom him whom they wish to nominate as 3haikh. In brief he should arrange a secret ballot, which I believe would be welcome and would certainly be much to everyone’s advantage. Having done so, lie should then summon the Family again and announce the name of the winner. That, to my mind, is all tna t is required, public announcements etcetera being left entirely to the Bahrain Administration. 11. I do not recommend that this should be regarded as a hard and fast procedure to be followed in any circumstances. It may conceivably be quite unnecessary, but the Political Agent should be authorised to put some procedure of this sort into operation if he is satisfied after consultation with the Adviser that it will be to the public advantage to do so. It/- #- 6 - It is not essentially different from what has been done in some States in India, and while designed to obviate confusion, it relieves us, I think, of any charge of offensive interference. Yours sincerely. r' €\a- fe^ HBHHIISHAIKH ABDULLA BIB ISA Is the second son of the late Shaikh Isa and his favourite wife Shaikha Ayesha, daughter of Shaikh Mohammed bin Khalifa who was banished, by the British Government, to Aden where he died. During the last ten years of Shaikh Isa’s life his wife had very great influence over him. The old lady is still alive and is now doing the Pilgrimage. Shaikh Abdulla was Shaikh Isa’s favourite son. His age is about 55. He has had a very slight education, a fact which he always regrets, but he lias a remarkably good knowledge of foreign politics and western progress and ideas. He is very intelligent, politically ambitious - I believe he has ideas that when Ibn Saoud dies Bahrain might possibly manage to acquire some control of part of the mainland - he is capable of making rapid decisions, and sticking to them in spite of opx^osition - the way he dealt with trouble in the schools some years ago is an example of this - he Msxxxsuqc is good at disguising his own feelings, has progressive ideas about administrative matters such as reforming the conditions under which estates of minors are looked after, the need for more medical work by the Government, Education, sanitation and agriculture. He is more religiously tolerant than most of his relations, he disapproves of such things as liquor more from the point of view of the harm that drinking causes than from the strict Moslem view that intoxicants are Haram. He is physically fit, until quite recently, and possibly still, he used to be thoroughly hauled over by Dr Dame every few months. His addiction to women is notorious, he has had more wives and concubines than any member of the Khalifah family, Y/hich is saying a good deal. He is reputed to be generous to his women while he has them and when he discards them. He always lives beyond his income, most of the family do, but he never asks for money. When he takes a loan he repays it - eventually. He is not vindictive and treats his servants and his own tenants well. He takes a firm line with his sons if they offend him, some time ago he had one of them thrashed by the servants in his Meglis for corning to the house drunk. In the past Shaikh Abdulla and his mother were feared and hated by the Bahama ( the Shia aboriginals ) towards whom they wrere very severe. Today he is not liked by the Bahama, especially the older ones who remember his past but their animosity towards him has lessened and since 1 have known him I have not heard of any cases of his ill treating them. Shaikh Abdulla has a strong following among the Khalifah especially among the younger men and a certain set living in Muharraq but he is disliked by the older Shaikhs who mistrust him. He is not popular among the Arab and foreign communities in Manama but he is not actively disliked, it is generally accepted that his opinion is valuable and his carjability is recognised in municipal and educational matters. He is far more effective and businesslike than his brother Mohammed. The latter is very jealous of him partly because Shaikh Abdulla has always had a larger salary from the Civil List although he is younger than Mohammed. About tdi twenty years ago Shaikh Abdulla was the most powerful man in Bahrain, Shaikh Isa gave him great authority, he dealt with all cases and disputes - there Y/ere no regu ar courts - and with money matters and political affairs although Shaikh Hamed was the Heir Apparent and had been officially recognised as such some time before. Possibly Shaikh Hamed took a second place from natural inclination not entirely because his brother was given more authority than him by Shaikh Isa.\1 In 1919 Shaikh Ahdulla went to England with his eldest son and some other Arahs^HisKx from the Gulf. He also went to India and to ggypt between 1919 and 1923. In 1927 Shaikh Isa was deposed and Shaikh hamed was made Deputy Ruler. Shaikh Abdulla and his mother were the real leaders of a strong party which opposed Shaikh Isa^ compulsory retirement though Shaikh Abdulla agreed outwardly to support his ksssitex brother. A number of leading Arabs were members of this party which .as financed by Shaikh Abdulla and his mother, they included Shaikh Abdel Wahab Zayani, Abdulla Zaid who now runs a printing nress, Jasim Chirawi who retired to India and several others/ Shaikh Abdulla was threatened with banishment if he did not behave. After this he made no open attempt to upset the authority of Shaikh Hamed and although in 1932 he was suspected by some of giving some encouragement to the divers v/ho created a riot I have haver known any occasion when he has not supportea his brother. 1 think sometimes he has influenced matters in such a way that he has obtained credit for settling trouble which he might have put a stop to earlier on. In 1925 Shaikh Abdulla, and a wife, went to England with Shaikh framed and his family. Shaikh Abdulla preferred his first visit. 3ince I have oeen in Sahrain Shaikh Abdulla has been consulted by Shaikh Hamed in almost every important matter regarding politics, oil negotiations, finance and family matters. In many cases matters of importance have been passed on by Shaikh Hamed to myself and Shaikh Abdulla or in some cases to myself and Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman and in all my oealings with Shaikh Abdulla I have found him quick, dzsiilsissx diplomatic and far seeing. Shaikh Abdulla has iour sons, Mohammed, Rashid, Ali and Hamed. Three of them used to drink, two of them still drink. None of the three elder sons are in any way distinguished and the youngest is still a boy.SHAIKH SULMAN BIN SHAIKH H.AMKD. © The eldest son of Shaiith Hsmed and a wife who died niciny years apo who was a member of the Khalifah family. Aged 42. He has very little education and very little knowledge of the outer world having never travelled anywhere except one visit to India and once to Egypt when returning from the Haj. His outlook ressembles very nearly that of his uncle Shaikh Mohammed hin Isa, his point of view is definitely that of the last n-eneration which differs radically from the younger men of today. He has the feudal feeling,he is old enough to remember the time when conditions were very different to today, when the Bahama were regarded by the Khalifah as serfs. He does not appreciate the changed conditions' today and the fact that the people of Bahrain, especially the Bahama, no longer regard individual members of the Ruling Family as feudal overlords.' He has a strong and undisguised antipathy to the Bahama who reciprocate this feeling. lie is not progressive^ and has shown no interest in modern innovations. He is rather warlike but he is not physically or mentally brave. He can be extremly obstinate. Shaikh Sulrnan is very good natured and has a sense of^ humour. He is a good mix&amp;r and gets on well with Europeans though he speaks no English. He is careful and sensible over money, not given to getting into debt but not mean. As a magistrate he was excellent, he has a retentive memory and knows more about the local people than any of the senior Shaikhs. He is sympathetic towards people or communities who are ill treated, such as the divers, strongly patriotic and aggressively anti-Persian. His domestic life gives no cause for comment. His view of peculiar morals, drink etc is that people should be allowed to do as they like as long as they are not found out. He is not popular among the younger Khalifah, he is disliked by the Bahama but has a following among the Arabs, He is frequently on bad terms with his father for reasons which often appear outwardly to be quite trivial and is jealous of some of nis younger brothers who are closer to their father. He does not like his uncle Abdulla. Shaikh Sulman owns more property than any of his brothers, most of it was gifted to him by Shaikh Isa who was fond of him. He does not take much interest in it but used constantly to be involved in cases with his tenants. He has two wives, both of the Khalifah, and two young son® by one of them. Twelve years ago Shaikh Sulman counted for very little. He lived mostly in Muharraq and was not friendly with his father. About ten years ago he was appointed as a magistrate on the Bahrain court, he sat intermittently for about seven years but retired two or three times until he was persuaded to resume the work by being given a higher salary. He worked hard and well but in cases where Shi a Bahama were involved he vras not impartial and this was one of the main causes of the disturbances among the Bahama in 1935. During the last three or four years Shaikh Sulman, I think greatly owing to my suggestion, has taken part in most discussions on important matters, especially local policy, sometimes with Shaikh Hamed~and the two brothers and myself but usually with myself and Shaikh Abdulla. On these occasions he has been very much less helpful than his uncles, this was especially the case during the Zabara affair. Shaikh Sulman is handicapped by never having been to Europe, I believe it would alter his outlook considerably, for the better, if he could be given an opportunity of seeing something of European countries and administrations.SHAIKH ABDULLA BIN SHAIKH I1AMKD. Fifth son of Shaikh Earned, his mother was a daughter of Shaik h Sulman hin Baij Al Fhalifah who died when he was quite young. He is full brother of Mubarak, Dai3 and Ahmed. Age 24. He has two wives, one is a daughter of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, the other a daughter of Shaikh Khalifah bin Sulman, by the former wife he has two sons, the eldest is about six years old. Shaikh Abdulla has had a better education than any of his brothers About twelve years ago he and Mubarak went as boarders to the Mission school at Kuwait for a term. During the year when an Indian tutor was employed to teach Shaikh Hamed’s younger sons Abdulla was the only one who showed any wish to learn and he worked hard and made the most of his opportunity. For the last three years he has been having regular lessons in English and other subjects from a young Arab in the Government office. He Is genuinely keen on educating himself. Shaikh Abdulla’s first public duty was about five years ago when he was appointed as a Magistrate on the Small Joint Court. After working there for some years during which time he acquired a good idea of court work he was promoted to the Bahrain Court in place of Shaikh Sulman who gave up doing court work. In court he is sensible careful and impartial, it is easier for him than for some of his relations to be impartial because he is not involved Sg&amp;St&amp;bm&amp;p with any of the local merchants. About two years ago he was made the Fr ssident of a committee which was appointed to compose a Code of laws and regulations in response to local demand. Although the committee has not yet produced its Code it has done useful work in editing various proclamations and rules and Shaikh Abdulla has dealt with the work and the members sensibly and diplomatically. -p our years ago Shaikh Abdulla went down to Bombay, for eye treatment,travelling through some of the native states en route, in 19-36 he accompanied his father to England, in his case the visit was a most valuable experience, he was very observant and showed a keen interest in all he saw including hospitals, schools, law courts and all the visible signs of western civilization. Shaikh Abdulla has now; obtained rather reluctant permission from his father to go to England for six months or a year to learn English. Shaikh Abdulla is in many ways typical of the present day young Arab of Bahrain. His point of view differs enormously from the point of view of the last generation. He is too young to remember Shaikh Isa s regime and therefore has no regrets for the past. Having grown up since the introduction of existing government institutions xx&amp;h he regards such things as courts, municipalities,police, rules and regulations, all of which are comparatively recent, as though they - - A b existed. His older relations still consider many of these reforms as new and unwelcome changes. He is interested in' outside affairs and reads books and newspapers. He is broad minded and tolerant and has not the violent dislike of the Shia Bahama which characterises so many of his relations. He is liked by the public who consider that kks his judgments in the court are fair. He often takes part in discussions with Kadis or deputations about court~ matters and on these occasions he argues sensibly Physically he is fairly strong but very short sighted, he was attended by Duke Elder in London. Since he married he has lived a quiet respectable life. He is very anxious that his children should be properly educated. He is not extravagant but rather fond of money. a V nte ^ in hiS garden and town Property and has lately built a number of shops. . 1*1 . ^ 0 ie difficult to estimate the value of his popularity,his fsxkx] foUAPL^ fona of him and depends more upon him than he used~ to. He is on good terms with his young cousins but the older shaikhs resent his being on the Bahrain Court except Shaikh Rashid bin koha^el who supports him strongly.

The room was cleared and His Highness proceeded to say that he thought it might be desirable if he nominated a Wali-Ahad. He asked for advice and, though I said I must necessarily obtain your views before giving him any official advice, he pressed me to say what I thought personally as his j-riend. Accordingly 1 replied that I thought it would be a very good tiling indeed if he would nominate his successor. It would put an end to the type of intrigue which goes on in which agitators attempt to make play with the names of the two main candidates for the Sheikhdom and to the whispers that go around that Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Saimaa are (separately) supporting agitation for their own ends; and generally it would clear the air, and remove cause for doubt and misgiving. Shaikh Hamad expressed appreciation and asked me to obtain official advice from you on this matter. He added tnat he intended to consult us also about the actual person to be nominated (assuming that he is advised to proceed with the idea).

The younger members of the Family have been at him to make a nomination and he has been greatly concerned at the rumours first that Shaikh Salman and afterwards that Shaikh Abdullah were tacitly supporting the agitation which has been going on, even though he does not believe them. I have on various occasions mentioned to you that I thought it was a great pity that Shaikh Hamad would not nominate his successor, and now that he has come to the point I would strongly urge that he be encouraged to do so. Admittedly we must side-step any attempt by him to involve us in the nomination, but that should not be difficult; at the worst it could be indicated that we should be quite content to see Shaikh Abdullah bin * Isa or either of his sons Shaikh Salman and Shaikh Abdullah so nominated. Indeed there might be advantages in so doing. These three are recognised as the on only possible candidates, and/Shaikh Hamad making his selection His Majesty* s Government might n take note** of it, withdnit any possible danger of committing themselves to the active support of the nominee in the event of a disputed succession. In * point of fact, as I have said in paragraph 6 of my letter Ho. C/15-1.a/16 dated the 6th January 1938, a nomination would almost certainly settle finally the question of the succession (I here. 4.

It shows the trust that Shaikh H^mad reposes in us that, without any prompting from us, in fact perhaps because we did not indulge in any prompting, he has asked our advice on the important matter of appointing a successor. 3, I agree generally with Weightraan^ views. Shaikh Hamad's declared intention of consulting us about the actual individual to be nominated as his successor is probably prompt ed by a desire, which he will then formulate, that His Majesty’s Government should recognise this successor. This in my opinion His Majesty’s Government should not do. 4. I suggest that I be authorised to instruct ^elghtman to inform Shaikh Hamad verbally as follows* (a) His Majesty's Government are of the opinion that it would be a wise provision for Shaikh I&amp;mad to appoint a successor. (b) should Shaikh Hamad take the further step of consulting us as to the actual individual to be nominated Weightraan should reply that His Majesty’s Government are of Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KGI!§., 031. ,MVO., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Hew Delhi. the /f the opinion that this is, of course, entirely a matter for the Shaikh to decide, but presumably the Shaikh’s choice^ will fall on Shaikh Abdullah bin ’Isa or either of his sons, Shaikh Salman or Shaikh Abdull&amp;h. (c) Should Shaikh Hamad ask for the recognition indicated in paragraph 3 above Veightman should reply that His Majesty’s Government, while they take note of Shaikh Hamad’s decision, cannot grant this prior recognition since to do so would be against their general policy concerning succession in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. 5. Should the Shaikh show signs of choosing as his successor an individual other than one of the tiiree mentioned above Weightaan can let me know and I will report further. * 6, I am sending copies of this letter with enclosure to Peel and without to /eightman.

He was pleased, but immediately invited me to tell him whom he should nominate, Ms brother cr his son. After a good deal of argument I induced him to realise that he alone must make the selection between these two. 3* I row hear that he wants to make the nomination in writing, without telling the Family that he has done so, to get me to wit- me. He shrinks from making a public nomination, since he fears the reproaches of the unsuccessful candidate. 4. 1 am afraid that there is very little prospect of getting him to change his ednd again and to nominate publicly. On the other hand It is obviously most desirable that a nomination should be made, even if the paper on which it is written is locked away until his death. At the same time it Is of the utmost importance that no allegation should be made later that he has been influenced by the Political Agent 5 and equally there must be no question of the authenticity of the document. In order to meet these desiderata I suggest the following procedure. T&gt; all thought that his plan of appointing an heir-apparent was ness it and to deposit either the original deed or a copy with The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, C.B.E His/ r vnvjns, . . v- « X * r*. , v , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire,- 2 - His Highness might have a document written out, leaving the A1 Khalifah Family to a meeting at which I myself should be present* Ee could inform them that he was making this nomina tion which would remain secret until his death, and then every one would be sent to the other end of the room while he wrote in the name. The paper could then be folded over and all pre sent could sign as witnesses; it could then be placed in an envelope and sealed, and handed to me, and I should deposit it in the Eastern Bank. I myself (alone) should know the name of the successor, merely in order to be certain that His Highness had not nominated someone quite unsuitable. 5. By this procedure we can ensure that the nomination is made, we could avoid any subsequent charge of undue influence, and there would be no question raised later that the document was not authentic. If you approve of this, I should be grateful for early orders as I anticipate that His Higliness will ask to discuss the matter with me in the very near future. name blank; he could then summon the leading members of the Yours sincerely ■To be kept in the personal possession o£ the Political Agent .

Could you please refer to your letter No*c/l92-l.a/16, dated the 26th March 1939, on the subject of the Bahrain Succession. 2. We have advanced a step in the matter since the Shaikh has apparently decided to make a selection between his brother. Shaikh Abdulla bin I a a, and his son, Salman - I presume that by **his son H is meant Salman and not Abdulla, though you do not say so* 3. I have considerable sympathy with the Shaikh’s objection to making a public nomination* Now and then Oriental Rulers do so, e*g. I bn Saud, but they normally have excellent reasons for refraining. The selected heir.presumptive is interested in the early demise of the Ruler 1, and the other claimants are disgruntled and inclined to form an opposition party straight away. 4. The crux of the problem lies in the last sentence of your paragraph 4* *1 myself (alone) should know the name of the successor, merely in order to be certain that His Highness had not nominated someone quite unsuitable 1 *. If we were certain that he would nominate either Abdulla bin Isa or Salman, or even his son Abdulla, any of whom would suit us (vide paragraph 4 (b) of my demi-official letter No.678-S, dated the 7th December 1938, to Metcalfe), the course could be followed of leaving the Shaikh / to Weightman isquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain# ■■MBlit \ ■ - 2 - to write out his own nomination and lodge it himself in the bank, (as you indicate the Shaikh would probably want the docu ment witnessed. You should certainly not witness it, and it would be undesirable, I think, for Belgrade to do so, while if any Arab witnesses It,the nomination will certainly not remain a secret. Is it absolutely necessary for it to be witnessed ?) This course would be distinctly preferable to your having any hand in the matter, if you do, even under the precautions suggested in your paragraph 4 it will certainly get about in Bahrain with embroidery from the Family that you, on behalf of His Majesty*s Government and myself, rigged the succession. This would have an extremely bad effect locally and, whoever the successor was, would certainly tend to make him unpopular with some, at all events, of the local elements. 5. if the course suggested above were followed I do not suppose that the Shaikh would care to divulge to his family the fact of its having been carried out, since he would probably be badgered by his relations, including his wife, to reveal hi 8 selection. If he felt like this he could postpone revealing to his family until on his death-bed the fact of the selection having been made, the name of the heir, and the fact that the document was deposited in the bank, «. It would be important for the Political Agent to know whom the Shaikh had selected and I suggest that in the course of acme interview the latter could merely inform you privately and verbally of the name of his selection. I think we can trust Hamad to tell the truth. ~T • c • EbHHHhHSecret &amp; D*0* Ho* C/237-1.a/16 Dated the 12th April 1939. Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. 287-S of the 31st March 1939 on the subject of the Bahrain Succession ? 2. I had some further discussion with Fis Highness on r') this matter this morning and he is still very anxious that everything should be kept entirely secret. He wanted to write out his nomination and to hand it to me to b e kept until it is wanted and I had a little difficulty in explaining to him that this would scarcely be to the advantage of his successor. However in the end he did agree that the document had better be lodged in the bank* 3. His Highness said that he wanted to consult the actual documents drawn up when he himself was nominated as heir - apparent and he promised to show these to me. I did not therefore raise the question of witnesses to-day and shall wait until I have seen these old papers. This is therefore i-'* a purely interim report.

The circumstances in ushich the present Shaikh of Bahrain (Shaikh Hamad) came to be recognised as successor designate to the Ghiefship by His Majesty's G-overnment were as follows. 2# In 1897 Shaikh Esa, father of the present Shaikh, sent his son to interview the Political Resident with the object of securing his recognition dy the British Government. The Resident informed Shaikh Hamad that it would be necessary for hie father to address him stating what his wishes were and that the Shaikh’s propo sals would be forwarded for the consideration of Government if sufficiently strong reasons were urged. On 7th February 1898 Shaikh Ssa wrote to the Resident enclosing &amp; copy of his will in which he declared the appointment of his son as heir apparent. The will was attested oy 44 of the leading men of Bahrain. Before referring the matter tc the Government of India the Political Resident asked for the views of local officers with particular regard to the custom and practice obtaining among Arab tribes relative to succession to Shaikhship ano the probable reaction of the people of Bahrain and tne surrounding tribes to a recognition by us of Shaikh Hamad. The general view appeared to be that whilst there was no recognised rule governing succession which in many cases was determined by financial and other considerations and by the approval of the elders of the trioe|, it was usual for the Shaikh’s nominee to be regarded as his successor and particularly so in the case of tribes dependent on, or tributory to, another power for its peaceful existence. Ab Bahrain was regarded generally as a British protectorate, it was anticipated ....Cf. letter from the Pol* Resident in Persian G-ulf No • 37 -S. 1., dated 13.6o 1898. No. 194 of 1898. anticipated that G-overnment 1 s support of Shaikh A i Hamad’s claims to Shaikhship would not only be viewed favourably but would also ensure a peaceful succession and increase our influence without augmenting our responsibilities. 3. In recommending the Shaikh’s request to the Government of India, the Political Resident expressed the® opinion f 'that the time has come to take a more decided position in Bahrain than we have hitherto done, and that the treaty engagements entered into between the British Government and the Shaikhs of Bahrain, followed by more recent closer relations, appear to justify an intimation by the British Government that the status of Bahrain towards the Government of India is identical with that of protected Native States in India”. It was argued that if this was done the recognition of Shaikh Hamad would merely follow prece- cenii often adopted in India. Further reasons urged were that the succession was approved by many of the elders of the tribea, a peaceful succession without the inevitable family quarrels which ensue on the demise of a Muhammadan ruler; and that recognition would strengthen the position of Shaikh Hemad. iinother (arid at the time not unimportant) reason mooted was that the recognition would effectually put an end to Turkey’s pretensions in regard to Bahrain. 4. The question was examined by the Government of India and the manner in which it was dealt with is briefly explained in their despatch to Secretary of State, dated the 27th October 1898. It may, however, be mentioned that the matter was fully discussed from the point of view of the constitutional issue raised6. •... 3 Cf. GrOVt# Of India*s despatch No. 194 dated 27.10.1898* * N- 44. Cf. Letter from the Govt, of India No. 205-E.i., dated 7.2.1899. U Cz by the Political Resident that *&amp; more decided position in Bahrain” should be taken and that an intimation should be made that the “status of Bahrain towards the Government of India is identical with that of protected Native States in India”. It was pointed that the intention was to establish an exclusive frelectorate over Bahrain. The Government of India were not m favour of this suggestion and held that in view of the existing Treaty engagements with Bahrain our position in respect of Bahrain did not stand in need of revisions while it was a maxim of general policy to avoid interference in the internal affairs of a Chiefship and particularly in dynastic disputes. It was, novyever decided to support the recognition of Shaikn Hamad on the grounds that the weakness of Shaikh rule had given rise in the past to intrigues for the restoration of the exiled branch of his family and that in the event of the succession remaining undecided there might have beenjrisk of disturbances, on the shaikh’s death, whichiwould have been detrimental to British interests. f 5. The secretary of State in his despatch dated 16th Lecember 1698 expressed the approval of His Majesty's Government to the proposed recognition of Shaikh Hamad* The decision was conveyed to Political Resident on 7th February 1899 and he was told at the same time that, without extending a British protectorate over Bahrain, the Government of India were “prepared to consider proposals to improve the arrangement for the discharge of local political duties in the island*.4 6.
