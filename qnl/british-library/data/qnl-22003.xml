As rice is urgently needed in Bahrain the importer, a local merchant, was told that he should import half of the consignment into Bahrain. For a considerable period^ with the cooperation of the local merchants, half of all consignments of rice, marked 'in transit' have been imported into Bahrain. This ocurred in the past in the case of another consignment of rice sent by Mr. B.A.Latif of Muscat to his agent in Bahrain. 2. Regarding the price of this rice, the importer is at liberty to sell the rice at whatever price he can obtain. The price of rice in Bahrain, although high, is very much lower than the price of rice in Saudi Arabia and it appears to be lower than the ppj_QQ of rice in Muscat. The reason for this is not because rice is available in Bahrain but because the controlled price of wheat is very much lower than in neighbouring States. In Saudi Arabia wheat is said to cost about 150$ more than its price in Bahrain. The Bahrain Government does not propose taking over this consignment of rice. cr K Adviser to the Government.

DJU1TUIJ.H . /£,Id June, 1948 g. iU7 ^ Dear Department We forward herewith a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent 9 Bahrain f aoout the wheat situation in Bahrain. 2. We have already taken up the question of the arrears of wheat due. with Messrs. Frank Strick &amp; Co., of Basrah and have received a satisfactory reply. \ 3. The Bahrain Government have a fairly efficient rationing system and we have no reason to doubt that they are now Issuing rations to X05 9 000 people as against 90,000 in 1940. The Increase is due partly to the natural growth of the population and partly to immigration. Owing to the comparative prosperity of Bahrain there has been substantial immigration from Persia. 4. It will be noted that the Bahrain Government request that either the original barley quota of 310 tons should be restored or that they should be supplied with rice or wheat in *' o. We have now received an application from the Bahrain Government for Brasilian currency up to £.120,000 to enable them to accept an offer of 2,000 tons of rice from Brazil. It is quoted at £.60 a ton and must be paid for in 'convertible sterling'. As we have no financial expert we find it a little difficult to follow the implication of your letter No. (E7402/ 115/91) of the 9th June, 1948, about Brazilian currency and ^would be grateful if you could kindly telegraph to us whether all or any of the exchange asked for may be made available to the Bahrain Government. We would note that that Government has no dollars at its disposal and that they can onlp be purchased in comparatively small quantities at a high rate in the Bahrain bazzar. The Shaikh is arguing that the exchange asked for ought to be made available for his Government as his country produces oil which can be exchanged for dollars and we believe it to be a fact that the Bahrain Petroleum Company do make-over a substantial amount of dollar earnings to His Majesty's Treasury. 6. We would add that we have received a similar application for Brazilian currency from the Kuwait Government but we will deal with this separately in the light of the reply received to this letter. What they really want is rice. 5.

Bahrain, to Prodrome. Bahrain. We shall be faced with a food crisis in Bahrain 9 If early steps are not taken to meet the present situation. 2. The original cereal quota for Bahrain was fixed at 900 tons (wheat 630 and barley 270) • In October 1943 on a representation by the Bahrain Government that this was not sufficient. It was Increased to 1000 tons (wheat 670 and barley 330;• In June 1945 the Bahrain Government* said that Its merchants could make private arrangement s to import barley and the barley quota was then given up leaving the wheat quota at 670 tons. In February 1946 the wheat allotment was fixed at 710 tons per month 9 the total quota being at 1020 tons per month (which included 310 tons of barley Imported under private arrangements)• 3. This quota did well enough when the ration could be supplemented by local purchase In the free market 9 but since the Persians have prohibited exports 9 this market no longer exists. Furthermore, the quota was originally fixed on the census figures of 1938 which gave the population for the purpose of rationing as 90,000 and ration cards were Issued for this number In 1940. Now they are Issued to 105,000 people. As a result the previous ration of 20 lbs. per head per month had In November 1947 to be reduced to 14 lbs. per head per month In the town and 16 lbs. per head per month In the villages. 4. The present population made the figure of 710 tons Inadequate to supply the country's needs even on the under* standing that ration was supplemented by local purchases to the extent that the Government Itself had to purchase wheat to supplement the Ministry of Food quota and It Issued an average of 954 tons of wheat per month, In 1947. 5. The Ministry of Food's wheat quotas for Bahrain for the months of April and May are In arrears. 6. To meet the situation the Bahrain Government's requests ares 1) that the arrears of the wheat quota for the months of April, May and June be delivered forthwith; and that the barley quota of 310 tons surrendered should be restored and, If possible, rice or wheat to that amount In that order of preference be delivered. 2 )\\ 0 Ko. l703-'j*S‘/ :r .o? 1367 Office of the Adviser to the G-overnment, Bahrain Dated, 13th Shaaban 1367 June 19, 1948.

No. HI*? ~ of 1367 Office of the Adviser to the Grovernment, Bahrain Dated, 23rd Shaaban 1367 June 29, 1948 H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - Rice Shipments Thro Bahrain^ Reference your memorandum No. 1907-29/21 /''v dated 17th June 1948, His Highness has this morning discussed the question of the transhipment of rice in Bahrain for other ports in the Gulf and he wishes me to acquaint you with his views on the matter. 2. About a year ago, in response to the requests of local merchants, after meetings of the merchants and the Food Control Committee, His Highness agreed that in order to give the merchants an opportunity of trading freely in cereals the Government would desist from importing cereals except the amount allowed to Bahrain under the quota. The merchants assured the Government that they would import grains into Bahrain to provide for the needs of the people. One condition was attached to this arrangement, the merchants were told that in the case of their import ing cereals for re-export they must sell half of every consignment in Bahrain. They were told that the Government would not control the price of their cereals but would let them sell locally at their own price. The object of these measures was to restore2 normal trading conditions. During and after the war the Government bought, imported and sold to the public all essential foodstuffs and clothing because it was found that honest cooperation by the merchants for the benefit of the people was not forthcoming. 3$ The new arrangement did not produce very satisfactory results. Because the price of cereals was low in Bahrain the merchants found that they could not make large profits by importing rice or wheat. A profit of about 50% is regarded by merchants as not unusually high. A few merchants /{ // however imported rice, marked in transit and, according to the arrangement, sold half of their consignments in Bahrain. Among the importers was Haj Mohamed bin Mekki who imported a consignment of rice from Haj Bac^ir Abdul Latif of Muscat, marked 'In Transit'. Of his own accord he decided to sell the whole consignment in Bahrain. 4. During the last week or two several cases have occurred in which importers of rice ,f In Transit' have endeavoured to avoid the obligation to sell half of their consignments in Bahrain, because the price of rice elsewhere is higher than the price in Bahrain. His Highness intends to insist on the arrangement being carried out and is issuing a proclamation to the effect that no cereals in transit will be allowed to be landed in Bahrain unless the importer sells half of the consignment in this country. His Highness feels that the serious shortage of food in Bahrain makes it essential to take this step. It is known that the Bahrain Government gains no financial advantage by 3/~4/~ 3 this action which is dictated solely by the need for obtaining more food for the people of the country, who are today existing on the inadequate ration of 14 - 16 lbs. of wheat per head per month. 5. The following specific cases of rice in transit were discussed by His Highness this morning:- (a) 581 bags of rice imported by Yusuf Fakhroo, 290 of these were sold in Bahrain, to the public, and the remainder re-exported to Eatif. (b) 1243 bags marked TT Darwish in Transits There is reason to believe that the purchase of this consignment was financed by Fakhroo. His Highness understands however that currency for this shipment was obtained on the recommendation of the P.C.L. , he will therefore allow its export to Qatar, but full customs dues will becharged as no customs agreement fV , / 7 exists with Qatar covering a special in transit rate. (c) 200 to 300 tons, expected shortly, by Fakhroo marked ,f Kuwait in Transit rt . It is understood that this rice is destined for Qatar. If it is landed here the Bahrain Government will insist on one half being sold locally, if the importer is not agreable he can take the rice elsewhere. (d) A consignment of 1028 bags of rice from Muscat to Haj Mohamed bin Mekki. This rice has been the subject of correspondence ending with your 1907- 29/21 dated 17th June 1948. His Highness is now willing that the Government should buy half of this shipment, at local market price, or to allow the importer to sell it locally at his own price.4 6.

For Political Agent, BahrainTranslation of letter dated the 17th Sha f ban, 1367 (23*6«48) from H.S. the Ruler of Qatar to the Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments, I beg to invite Your Excellency’s attention to a matter of vitality and essentiality in relation to the pressing need we face in meeting the food supplies of the company and their employees. On the llttO'larch, ly48, an application was made by Qasim and Aodullah Dawish for import of 200 tons of rice (Belgian Congo rice) from Darus-Balam in Africa. A recommendation Certificate for that purpose was issued by Your Excellency on the 11th Tterch, 1948, to the Eastern Bank, Bahrain This was after Your Excellency had been assured that the rice was required for the consumption of the Company and their employees. Out of this, 100 tons did actually arrive in Bahrsd n by steamer; but on arrival thereof, the Director cf Customs in Bahrain said tT®. t he would take over half of the rice. This is as strange as incongruous to the spirit of justice and to the practice; for this rice was imported as a special case by the permission of Your Excellency and for a particnalAr purpose, so the Director of Customs has no right to take over half of, it being so badly needed and imported as a s]$ cial case. In view of the above, we reqie st four Excellency to extend us your assistance so as to p® vent the rice being interfered with or any part of it being taken. It is not within the right of the Director of Customs in Bahrain to seize any imports allowed as a special case by the permission of Your Excellency. We therefore reserve to ourselves the right and protest against the Director of Customs' interference without right or justification. We request Your Excellency to consider this natter in accordance with the justice we feel you are charactised by and to prevent the Director of Customs from interference. I am sending Your Excellency a copy of the recommendation Certificate issued to the Eastern Bank/-* r 2 a Bank and hope that the export of the whole rice^Oe accomplished* We are confident of Your Excellency's nelp in this matter* &gt; Usual Ending* / (•d-ift. v/ . 2 * &lt;7 &lt;3. f-I?

Dundas, Foreign c j Please refer to despatch No. 1573 (80/7SA) of 16 June, from the Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, a copy of which was sent to Stewart on 25th June. The I.E.F.C allocation of rice for British Middle East Responsibilities for 1948 has already been divided amongst the claimant territories leaving no balance. As no claim was submitted by Bahrain we cannot supply rice to the Shaikhdom this year unless we get a supplementary jallocation and there seems to be no chance of this except from U.S.A which woud presumably be ruled out as a source of supply because the Bahrain Government have no dollars. If Bahrain want an allocation of rice for 1949 they should formulate their claim in good time - say October - and we will see that it receives consideration. We shall be able to let you have a copy of the I.E.F.C Rice Questionnaire for transmission to Bahrain who would complete and return it so that we can put it before I.E.F.C. , As regards the reported offer of Brazilian rice, Brazil is a member of I.E.F.C and we should not/heitSdispose of her rice to Bahrain who have no I.E.F.C allocatigji.^ || We do not understand the reference jS! if**ahe letter' of 3rd June, which accompanied the uespatch&lt;of 16th June, to a wheat quota of 710 tons a month for Bahrain. We are, and have been sometime, supplying the Shaikhdom w r ith 780 tons a month. We do not feel that w r e should be Justified in increas ing this quota at present. Bahrain have only recently paid for and received their w ? heat quota for April. 4 I do not know whether the quotas for May, June and July have yet been shipped, but if not they will be made available for shipment as soon as payment has been made. Their deliver;, should result in fairly comfortable wheat stock position in Bahrain. If the Iraq Government decide to permit exports of barley and if Bahrain do, in fact, need supplies of cereals over and above the regular wheat quota the Bahrain Government might obtain enough Iraqi barley by direct purchase to see then through to the end of the year.

What do the letters I.E.F.C. stand for? 2. The Bahrain Government was not aware that claims for an allocation of rice would have be considered in 1948. Bahrain certainly wants an allocation of rice for 1949 and therefore may a copy of the Rice question naire be acquired for Bahrain? 3. There is no doubt whatever about Brazil rice having been offered to Bahrain merchants by firms in Brazil. 4. The Bahrain quota is now 710 tons, Q,atar receives 70 tons through Bahrain. Should not this fact be explained to the Ministry of Food who may then perhaps be inclined to reconsider the matter? The letter rather implies that there might be doubt about Bahrain paying promptly for shipments. We would be prepared to deposit payment in advance if by so doing our quotas could be expedited. 5. Barley is of very little use in Bahrain and its price in Iraq is higher than that of quota wheat. The suggestion that we should buy barley in Iraq is not very helpful. 5 3D Adviser to the Government.No. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHxlA IN, Dated 17Aaji:it, 1948, To The Secretary to His Excellency the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. MEMORANDUM. 2. Follov'ing are my comments on Mr. Shingler T s letter: Paragraph 2 . As the Bahrain Government did not know it could submit a claim, it would seem now to have a claim for a supplementary allocation. As ban beer, pointed out, the argument thet the ’’Bahrain Government has no dollars*’ does not seem entirely conclusive. As far as is known the Bahrain Petroleum Company earns a large number dollars controlled by Tlis Majesty* s Treasury and it seems only fair that a special allocation of these (over and above the ordinary allocation) be made for the purchase of rice. Bahrain certainly wants an allocation of rice for 1949 and a copy of the rice questionnaire should be acquired for transmission to the Bahrain Government. Paragraph 3 . Not understood. Several firm offers of Brazilian rice have been made to merchants in Bahrain by firms in Brazil. Paragraph 4 . 70 tons of the 780 tons are for the Shaikhdom of Qatar. The statement that Bahrain has ONLY ’’recently paid for and received their wheat quota for April” seems to imply that Bahrain has not been prompt in making payments for shipments. This is not the case. The Bahrain Government, as already reported (vide my D.O.No.R-127, dated the 19th June, 1948, to you) , is quite ready to make payments IN AD VANCE for food supplies. Paragraph 5 . The price of barley is higher than that of quota wheat and it is unpopular in Bahrain. (SGD) C.J.

We made arrangements to import foodstuffs from remote countries bearing all the trouble and incurring all the expenses , indifferently - all because of our need for these food supplies in order to meet the requirements of the company and its employees. imported to Qatar via Bahrain and thanked Your Excellency for your glorifying attitude. As we required large quantities of foodstuffs to meet the demands of the company and the public, we arranged for further quantities of rice and thus we purchased 600 tons from abroad at high prices which we accepted under pressure of necessity These we'purchased from Holland. 4000 bags of rice were shipped from Rotterdam in the name of Qatar on a ship destined for Dubai from where we arranged for them to be transported from shipside to Qatar by boats. But to our astonishment, we knew that the Residency Agent, Sharjah, interfered with the rice without good reason and issued orders impounding half of the quantity, without we knew the reasons which actuated him to interfere and impound the rice which was shipped from Holland to Qatar: hhile on the other hand he neglects the question of the baots and the launches that have been and are still coming from Dubai laden with grains and provisions for Saddi Arabia which pass through Qatar en route to Dhahran. We say this with confidence as the last consignment which arrived from Dubai was consisting of 380 bags of wheat shipped from Dubai on board the launch of Obaid bin Thani. She passed through Qatar on the 8th Shawwal, 1367 (13.8.48) on her w ay to Khubar, the Nakhuda being Sultan bin Abdullah Al-Ajmani. Before this there were many other launches. Do you not believe with me, 0 Your Excellency, that it is surprising enough that the shipment of such foodstuffs from Dubai should be overlooked and that the rice which belongs to Qatar and which was exported from Holand for urgent requirement! should be impounded. consigned for Qatar by sea route is not within the right of anyone to impound, especially when it is done so for the sane of a country from which foodstuffs' export to Saudi Arabia. I, therefore, request Your Excellency to think over .this matter and instruct the Residency Agent not to interfere with this rice and to permit the agent there (Shaikh’s agent) to ship it to Qatar. It is my hope that Your Excellency by your wide comprehen sion will appreciate pur difficulty in importing this rice and will look at the situation relating to. our demands. We are confident that Your Excellency will realise our conditions and that by your far-sightedness you will percieve that the impounding of this rice without good reason is a matter which justice does not warrant and which does not agree with the principle of humanity. shall remain thankful.

As we think it most unlikely thet /y the Brasilian Government would permit the export of rice to a country udiich has no I.E.P.C. allocation we assume that the offers referred to rre not cover d by export licences.

The suggestion, in my letter of 8th July, th£.t the Bahrein Goveriment might make their own arrangements for purchasing barley was made because the Sheikdom had asked for the barley quota to be restored. As requested I am enclosing twelve copies of the I.E.P.C. Rice Questionnaire for transmission to the Political Agencies in the Persian Gulf. Sheik dans wishing to claim an allocation of rice for 1949 should return two completed copies to reach us not latei* than 15th October.

The present struggle in which we are engaged to improve Sterling Area and European productiveness vis-e-vis the U.S.A. will also of course benefit the Sheikdoms in a more plentiful supply of gooda frcmi Europe and the Sterling Area when that struggle micoeeds. To fritter dollars away on inessentials will delay recovery and henoe lessen the gross supply of goods from all sources in future years* Another argument is that dollar inessentials are at present expensives it would be foolish to spend oil royalties on them now when by waiting much better terms can be obtained* The general aLms of our import policy are set forth in the two telegrams of 20th May to the Colonies, copies of which were sent to the Resident and which might also be of use in any discussion* Finally it should be pointed out that the participation of the Sheikdoms in the Sterling Area is not complete* They enjoy all the benefits but do not have to abide hy all the rules governing the other members* Thus exchange is granted freely for imports from the Sterling Area and from most other countries outside the Western Hemisphere, and for essential inports from the Western Heed.sphere, but merchants in the Sheikckxns are not obliged to surrender the foreign currency proceeds of their exports to the Exchange Control* The Sheikh of Kuwait will soon begin receiving substantial dollar payments under the oonoesaion in the Neutral Zone #iioh he has recently granted to an American Company* When that happens we shall have to insist that these dollars must be used for Kuwait*s requirements before we make aiy available out of the pool* In fact we hope that Kuwait should soon be self- supporting in dollars* This will need more thought when the time comes, but it is as well that the Resident should have it in mind* / I believe/■s I believe that the danger of extreme pressure by the Sheiks for dollars is not isndnent, provided their iauediate essential needs are granted. We oast ultimately provide goods of the right sort in sufficient quantities to meet the bill represented by the Sheik's earnings from oil royalties; the Resident s task in effect is to persuade the Sheiks to wait for tne day when sterling convertibility is restored without promising any date for this, and meantime to convince them that their essential dollar needs will be met, and all reasonable demands rr outside hard currenqy countries will be granted. Tours sinosrely.0F.89/W1 STERLING AREA DQTJJLR RECEIPTS FROM OIL Thesa receipts are of two kinds ( 1 ) Dollar royalties * Practically the only example of these is provided by the concession recently awarded by the Shaikh, of Kuwait to the American Independent Oil Company in respect of his share of the Kuwaiti—Saudi Arabian Tteutral Zone* Under the terms of that concession the Shaikh will, we understand by now have received the sum of/$7$75,000 and will from 1949 onwards receive an annual royalty of at least 625,000. Althougn Kuwait is not required to surrender these dollars to the Sterling Area pool, the existence of this income is bound to affect the amount of the net hard currency quota which will be made available to Kuwait from the pool. ■ (2) Dollar receipts from American distributors who the mselve_s re-sell sterling Area oil outside the Sterling Area . As the Kuwait Neutral Zone^Qatar andTother concessions are not yet producing oil in commercial quantities description of the financial arrangements in force is limited to the two cases of (a) Bahrein and (b) Kuwait proper. (aH i) The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited (B.P.C .) is nominally registered in Canada and owned Jointly by two big American oil companies (50j6 by Standard Oil Company of California and 50# by the ‘texas Company). B.P.C. is administered and controlled from New York. It sells its oil through its subsidiary the California Texas Oil Company (Caltex), which is nominally registered in the Bahamas, but is also considered as American for exchange control purposes and must therefore pay dollars in respect of all oil shipments from Bahrein to countries outsiee the Sterling Area. When oil produced or refined at Bahrein is sold by Caltex inside the Sterling Area sterling revenue accrues to B.P.C. (ii) B.P.C. requires sterling for local expenses in Bahrein and for purchases of equipment, etc., elsewhere in the Sterling Area. It requires dollars for purchases of. Saudi Arabian crude oil from the Arabian American Oil Company *, for American equipment and materials, for the salaries of American loyes at Bahrein and elsewhere. Bank of England) whi ransfenable to U. S.A* because B.P.C. is an American controlled company. (iii) B.P.C. is allowed to use its sterling revenue to meet its sterling requirements and for the purchase of dollars for the above purposes. Since its dollar requirements far exceed its dollar earnings we shoild expect « The Deeds of 1936 and 1940 supplementary to the mining lease of 1934 are intended to ensure the t these purchases will not lead to a reduction of crude oil production in Bahrein itself. and for remittances profits (agreed with the B.P.C.B.P.C* in an average year to remit a seven figure sum in dollars from London to New York. Thus on halance the Sterling Area pays and doss not earn dollars in respect of B.P.C* operations, and the existence of some dollar earnings, which are accounted for to the Bank of England cannot Justify any claims by the Sheikh of Bahrein for dollars to be spent on inessentials. (iv) At present any dollar remittances of profits to U. S.A. may well largely be re-invested by B.P.C. in equipment needed for its current improvement schemes. But even when these are completed the remittances of surplus funds to U. S.A. will continue and no dollars will accrue to the Sterling Area Exchange Control from the activities of B.P.C. (b)(i) The Kuwait Oil Company Limited (K.O.C.) is considered a British resident for exchange control purposes and is controlled Jointly by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited of London and the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pittsburg, U.S. Crude oil produced at Kuwait is normally shared equally be^ een the two shareholders. A considerable capital expansion programme is at present on hand to enable production to reach a level of 418,000 barrels^fn^l951 and the company expected last year that for some 2£ years from then until the end of 1949 it would be Incurring capital expenditure at the rate of roughly £6 millions a year about one half of which would be in dollars. These dollars would be found from the Gulf Oil Company’s 50g subscription towards the funds of K.O.C. (ii) Dollar earnings accrue to us from Kuwait Oil only when Anglo-Iranian Oil Company or the Gulf Oil Corporation sell- this crude oil to American firms for consumption outside the Sterling Area, but even in so far as such sales do in fact take place the dollar earnings from them have to be set ^ against the profits which the Gulf Oil Corporation earns on its^sterling sales of Kuwait oil and which it is allowed to transfer into dollars and to remit to America. The time when Kuwait can claim that its oil is not only a dollar saver but also a net dollar earner for the Sterling Area waild also seem to be still distant and the operations of K.O.C. thus provide no grounds on which the local iHiler can claim to receive additional dollars from us.JBSTIONNAIRE NO . 6 RESTRICTSD CLfiMAN'T C C&gt; I//V ftf I £ s INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY POOD COMMITTEE COMMITTEE ON RICE DATA REQUIRED FOR FORMULATION OF ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION FOR rrtNUrtft'j j June IK 4 * (To be filed with Secretariat by Isf- No\/. /9^^) Country DATA FOR j Sunk A.

Mr.Ibrahm alKhalfan# bahra^^ The Food Controller drew the attention of the meeting to the high prices being demanded and paid for meat at present, which he explained was due to there being no barter- in orther words, the price of sugar in Bahrain was the same as prevailing in Persia, between Rs 80/90 per bag# In order to bring the price of meat down, it wp.s therefore necessary to.give some inducement and profit to the importers, so that once again the sale price to butchers and public could be controlled# To do this the Government proposed purchasing the whole of the 1949 sugar quota, utilising the barter portion for sale at reduced prices to importers of live stock# The profit made on the resale in Persia of the sugar would the importer of live stock to sell at reduced prices to the butchers - two members of the Food Control Committee would in fact value the animals, the butchers in turn would then retail to the public at prices fixed by the Government. It was also hoped to utilise barter sugar to encourage the import of Busrah dates# The meeting agreed to the Government's proposals. The next item discussed ms the shortage of fish- and after a general discussion as to the reasons why, it was decided that the Food Controller should have a meeting with representatives of this industry and trv and work out means whereby, with Government help, the quantities of fish brought to the fish markets in Mamamah and Maharaq be substantially increased. # , , The Food Controller next informed the meeting that at present the local market was overstocked with Piecegoods, and in order to help im porters release stocks, the Government proposed to dis-continue cloth rationing Indian quota piecegoods would remain price controlled in the same manner as for piecegoods imported from the TJ.K., U.S.A., China etc., but could be sold freely to retailers, who in turn could sell freely to r -he general public# Indian quota piece goods could not however be exported frcm Bahrain# To this the meeting agreed unanimously.

We have no information about the alleged import ation of Brazilian Rice by Fakhroo of Bahrain who might possib ly have purchased it with ’•free' dollars, but if as the Shaikh of Dubai currency can be granted for this purpose, we would suggest that a Quota of Brazil-ian Currency might be allotted to the Trucial Coast for the purchase of rice.

After Compliments. I write to inform you that the country is in great need for rice which constitutes the main diet of the people. Imports from Iran have stopped owing to the ban on its export from there and the Iranian authorities restrictions against its export. All the available stocks have been consumed and there is now/thing expept 120 tons of Egyptian rice which was imported this week from Aden. According to the regulations in force I allowed the importer to export half the quantity and retain the other half for internal consumption. This will only be sufficient for a few days. Local merchants are prepared to import rice from Brazil but need hard currency to enable them to cb so. Actually three ‘ &gt; v /\ • merchants, namely, Ragoowanshi, Bhamnamal Issardas and Rais Hasan Saadi applied for hard currency to enable them to import rice from Brazil but they have received no result so far. I, therefore, request you to address the Political Agent at Bahrain on the subject and request him to give special consideration Id this matter and help to grant the necessary hard currency to the abovementioned merchants, each to the extent he deserves, so that they may take early steps to import rice from Brazil as was granted to Yusuf Pakhroo in B&amp; rain.

There h*e been considerable confusion over the cuestIon of the supply of rice for the Gulf States due to misunderstandings both here and In the United Kingdom, and 1 am writing this letter to endeavour to clarify the situation. 3 . Bice grows nowhere in the Gulf States, but for meny generations has been a staple food for a very large part of the population. Though people can live without it, it must be regarded almost as an *ef j sentlal*. It may perhepe be compared, to tea which was unknown in the United Kingdom a few centuries ago, but has now become to all intents and purro^es an essential article of consumption. Before the war, rice was available in large quantities and at cheap rates and practically all classes of the settled population consumed it. During the war, imports of rice dwindled and it became much more expensive. Imports from Burma and India eventually ceased altogether, end the Gulf States became dependent on limited supplies from Persia. This rice wee illicitly exported from Persia and was often ns id. for in kind, e.g. it wee exchanged for tea and sugar. In Bahrain its price was controlled and when supplies were sufficient, I think I am right in saying that it was rationed, but elsewnere there was no price control or rationing and its consumption was limited to the better classes. The Persian Government having recovered some of their Naval craft are now able to take more effective action to prevent the Illegal export of rice from their side of the Gulf and supplies from that source have almort entirely ceased. This has led to a demand from all theGulf Statea for the allocation of a rice quota from some other source. k. I would again point out that rice cannot be entirely as a luxury. Practically all would consume it * were plentiful and they could afford it, and the ruling families and people of the better clasa who, by the rules have to entertain largely, and do entertain both rich and poor alike, would be looked down uron if they could not provide their guests with rice. 5 . In the olrcumstsncen of the e* 8 «, it hpsb-onvery difficult to complete the cueetlonneire received through the hiddle Secretariat from the Internetionel Emergency Food Committee, and I am afraid none of tham have not been very adepuetely answered. I hare been avay on tour a great deal and have keen able to check them personally. None of the ponuleaon of the Oulf can be described as 'basically rice eating* and owing to shorts e oj supplies Miss C. *f» ter low, Middle Bast Secretariat, Foreign Office, London. mjamsupplies there has, generally speaking, been no definite rationing system and it is therefore iwpoeffible to describe any of the population as 'rationed on rice'. The most ve can do is to make a rough estimate of the amount required in each area for the people who ean afford rice and really require it to keep^their position. On this basis my rough estimate of our requirements for every aix months is aa follows:- Kuwait - 3,000 tons, ( Bahrain - 2,000 tons, Truclsl Coast - 1,000 tons, Muscat - 1,000 tons; but Kuwait and Bahrain where the standard of living la now fairly high owing to payments received from the Oil Companies would probebly take more If it could be made eveliable# 6. A question I have been considering is to what extent the wheat ration could be reduced if the above quantities of rice can be supplied# I have made enquiries from the States and some have asked that rice should be supplied in lieu of a barley quota which was allocated early in the war, but never taken up# Kuwait is willing to accept an equivalent reduction in its wheat quota, and Bahrain has eugreated a reduction In its wheat quota upto half of the amount of rice supplied. In the early years of the war when rice was from time to time made available from the Government of India, the principle followed was that suggested by the Bahrain Government and I would recommend that if possible it should be applied now. 7# The local people much prefer rice from Northern India or Persia to Egyptian rice, but if only the Egyptian variety can be made available, ve must accept it# 8. I forward herewith the Muscat questionnaire and a revised Truclal Coast questionnaire# You have already received the Bahrain and Kuwait questionnaires. The Bahrain questionnaire Is more or less in order# I forward another Kuwait questionnaire revised on the basis of my paragraph 5- 9# While on this subject I would mention that I have Just heard from the Political Agent, Kuwait, that the International Emergency Food Committee have addressed the Shaikh direct about the rice questionnaire. The Shaikh has informed the Political Agent that he does not wish to deal direct with the Committee, and such direct correspondence is not in accordance with our usual practice here. All questions of supplies through official sources have in the past been dealt with by the Political authorities in the Gulf and it Is desirable on many grounds that this practice should continue. 10. I should be most grateful if the whole situation so far as rice is concerned could be explained to the International Emergency Food Committee on the basis of this letter and if they could be persuaded to make allocations to the Gulf States on the lines I have recommended, without attaching too much importance to the questionnaire which is so framed as to make It difficult to give a proper picture of the requirements of our small and somewhat primitive States# 11.

As, however, the average income on the Trucial Coast is extremely low, any reduction of the present relatively cheap wheat quota (Rs. 2-12-0 per 9 lbs maund) and its proportional substitution by more costly rice would cause widespread hardship and the poorer classes would probably have to reduce their total consumption of food grains. it fetches as much as Rs. 12-0-0 per maund. 5 # if a reduction in the wheat quota is to be made, I should suggest that the rice replacing it should sell at Rs.3-0-0 per 9 lbs maunder less.

(fi 16878/69/65) Dear Miss Waterlow, Portman Court, Portman Square, London, 17* 1. 21st December, 1948. I thank you for your B 15873/69/65 of 17th December enclosing letter dated 8th December from W.R. Hay of the Persian Qulf Residency Bahrein together with completed questionnaires from Muscat, Kuweit, and the Trucial Coast. These questionnaires come too late to forward to the I.E.F.C. who have already published rice allocations for the first half of 1949. However, they have allocated for this period Bahrein 1900 metric tons Egyptian rice; Trucial Coast 2000 metric tons Egyptian rice, while Kuweit is included in a block j allocation for 1949 of 40000 tons Egyptian rice to 'Arab States' (including also Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan and Arab Palestine). The Ministry have a Purchase Agreement with Egypt, and (subject to receiving deliveries under this Agreement) can supply Bahrein, Trucial Coast and Muscat. Kuweit, however, will have to make their own arrangements for purchase with the Egyptian Authorities. Although Muscat is not included in the allocations, I think the allocation of 2000 tons for the Trucial Coast is intended to cover Muscat also, and consider there would be no harm in amending the quantities to be shipped to these three territories more in accordance with paragraph five of Hay's letter provided the total quantity of 3900 tons is not exceeded, L The Ministry's normal method of selling rloe to Middle Bast territories is to place monthly quantities f.o.b. Alexandria or Port Said. The Ministry have an Agency in Egypt, the British Ministry of Food Rice Agency, 1 Rue Centrale, Alexandria, who, when the Ministry have authorised release, cable an offer of the quantity released to the territory concerned advising them of the f.o.b. price. After receiving acceptance they engage suitable freight for Receivers Account and ship the rice. Possibly freight consideraticne may make it desirable to ship two or three months' quotas at the same time to these territories, but this can be arranged later. It is, - however, necessary either that confirmed irrevocable credits are opened in London in the Ministry's favour to cover the cost of the rice or that payment is made in London before shipment is made. Such credit or payment should include the cost of the freight if this is to be prepaid in Egypt. // I suggest that the most convenient method would be for the Sheikdoms to appoint authorised agents who can receive rice on their behalf and arrange payment with the Ministry of Food in Londor^J I understand that Frank Strick &amp; Go. act for the Cereals Division of the Ministry in the Persian Gulf and possibly they might be suitable agents for the Sheikdoms to appoint. To sum up what the Ministry would like to know are:- (a) How the 3900 tons are to be divided between Bahrein, the Trucial Coast and Muscat. (b) To whom are the Rice Agency at Alexandria to make offers when releases are authorised. (c) To what Ports are shipments desired (d) ’.Vho will make payment to the M.O.F. in London. I would be glad if an answer could be given to these questions as soon as possible so that if the Sheikdoms desire to take advantage of these allocations, shipments can commence early in the New Year.

Dear Miss Waterlow, I thank you for copy of letter 46/21/49 of 7th February from Persian Gulf Residency. The subdivision of the this letter is approved. allocation as set out in y The Ministry of Food, however, will not grant any releases of rice to the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms until proper financial arrangements are made by those Sheikhdoms. We are not prepared to ship the rice first and then try and collect the money afterwards. I explained in my letter of 21st December that either a confirmed irrevocable credit must be chained opened in London or payments made in advance to the Ministry in London, before we authorise our Agency in Egypt to ship any rice to these territories. r\ The Ministry*s present price of Egyptian rice (Mamsough quality) is £39. 7s. 6d. per 1016 kilos gross f.o.b. Alexandria or Port Said, but this price may vary and it will probably be necessary to prepay freight, therefore any credits established should be for rice at a price not exceeding £46 perton (1016 kilos gross) including cost ppiee of freight if that is prepaid. Credits should allow for partial shipments to be accepted. Once such credits have been opened, or assurances received from a reputable London firm that pre—pa^m^nt will be made, we will instruct our Egyptian Agency to offer and ship the rice to the destination required as explained in my letter of 21st December. Marine insurances is not,normally arranged by the Ministry whose responsibility ends when the rice is f.o.b. and so the Sheikhdoms must make their own arrangements for this.

Dear Miss Waterlow, I thank you for copy of letter 46/21/49 of 7th February from Persian Gulf Residency. The subdivision of the allocation as set out in this letter is approved. The Ministry of Food, however, will not grant any releases of rice to the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms until proper financial arrangements are made by those Sheikhdoms, fce are not prepared to ship the rice first and then try and collect the money afterwards. I explained in my letter of 21st December that either a confirmed irrevocable credit must be attained opened in London or payments made in advance to the Ministry in London, before we authorise our agency in Egypt to ship ary rice to these territories. The Ministry^ present price of Egyptian rice (yamsough quality) is £39. 7s. 6d. per 1016 kilos gross f.o.b. Alexandria or Port Said, but this price may vary and it will probably be necessary to prepay freight, therefore any credits established should be for rice at a price not exceeding £46 perton (1016 kilos gross) including cost p*4ee of freight if that is prepaid. Credits should allow for partial shipments to be accepted. Once such credits have been opened, or assurances received from a reputable London firm tnat pre-payment will be made, we will instruct our Egyptian Agency to offer and ship the rice to the destination required as explained in my letter of 21st December. Marine insurances is not normally arranged by the Ministry whose responsibility ends when the rice is f.o.b. and so the Sheikhdoms must make their own ^ arrangements for this. I think it would be most convenient from every body’s point of view if each Sheikhdom can appoint a reputable firm as London agents empowered to make payments on their behalf for rice shipments and affect Insurance et..

It has been explained to him that his request has beenso long delayed that it is not certain that it can still be met, fend^also that for but he insists that only the Baluchistani rice is wanted. k. On the subiect of rice generally, Abdullah Darwish has told me that he is importing on his own ac count 290 tons of 'temween” rice fron Egypt, by direct shipment to Umm Sa’id. This he hopes should sell at less than 20 rupees the maundof 56 lbs. 1 asked him what he thought were the requirements of the country and he said he thought they could consume up to 200 tons a month with the rising* level of employment. Salih meanwhile is shipping on his own account oo tons^ of rice which as far as T could gather comes from rersia originally, which he has bought from Thunayyan el uhanim in Kuwait.

A reference^to the Residency for clairification on the above ^ points ^is suggested. D.F.A. I. In the meanwhile, we may know the requirements of Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast (All under our jurisdiction). Drafts II, and III are placed below for approval. (From N/Para.^i^) P.A.

The file consists mainly of letters from Bahrain and Dubai merchants, or from the Imperial Bank of Iran and the Eastern Bank Limited on their behalf, also from the local manager of the Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited on behalf of oil company personnel, asking the Political Agent, Bahrain to permit them foreign currency exchange facilities for the purchase of rice from Brazil and other non-Sterling countries. Also included in the file are the Political Agent’s responses, including importation recommendation certificates and letters to their banks, approving the release of sterling for the opening of letters of credit and hard currency payments to exporters.The file also contains the successful bids made to the International Emergency Food Committee (IEFC), Washington by the British Government on behalf of Bahrain, Qatar, Dubai and the other Trucial Coast shaikhdoms, for a share in the 1949 Middle East rice allocations. In relation to this matter there is the correspondence of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Bahrain with the Rulers of Bahrain, Qatar and Dubai and also with British officials at the Ministry of Food and the Foreign Office in London. In this correspondence, they discuss reducing existing wheat quota imports for Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms in favour of increased rice quota imports, the arrangements for the local storage and stock management of the IEFC allocated Egyptian rice by British Ministry of Food officials in Cairo, the appointment of approved purchasing and shipping agents by the Bahrain and Dubai authorities to act for them and for their merchants with regard to orders, payments and deliveries of the IEFC allocated Egyptian quota rice by sea to Bahrain, Qatar and Dubai.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>International Emergency Food Committee</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Food</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Food resources</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rice</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
