Treats of the Towns, Cities, Country and Cu~ fioms of Bengal, particularly on thofe near the famous Ganges, with jome hiftorical Accounts ancient and modern of Fort W illiam. IT L T lies on the Banks of a River fuppofed to be a Branch of the Ganges, about 5 Leagues from that of B alia fore, former ly it was a Place of Trade, and was honoured with Englifh and2)/^Fa6k)ries. The Country produces the fame Commodities that Ballafore does, t A ^ at^ A new Account at prefent it is reduced to Beggary by the Faftory's Removal to Hughly and Calcuttay the Merchants being all gone. It is now in habited by Filhers, as are alfo Inge Hie, and Kidgerie, two neighbouring Tflands on the Weft Side of the Mouth of Ganges, Thefe Iflands abound alfo in tame Swine, where they are fold very cheap, for I have bought One and twenty good Hogs,between 50 and 80 Pound Weight each, for 17 Rupees, or 45- Shillings Sterling, Thofe Illands fend forth dangerous Sand Banks, that are both nume rous'and large, and make the Navigation out and in to Hughly River, both troublefom and dangerous, c and after we pafs thofe Illands, in going up the River, the Chanel for Ship- ing is on the Eaft-fide, and feveral Creeks run from the Chanel among a great Number of Illands, formed by differen t jChanels of Ganges^ two of which are more remarkable than the reft, viz. Coxes and Sagor Iflands, where great Ships were obliged to anchor to take in Part of their Cargoes, becaufe fe veral Places in the River are too fhallow for great Ships to pafs over, when their whole Cargoes are aboard. There are no Inhabitants on thofe Iflands, for they are fo peftered with Tigers, that there could be no Security for human Crea tures to dwell on them ; nay, it is even dan gerous to land on them, or for Boats to an chor near them, for in the Night they have fwimmed to Boats at Anchor, and carried Men out of them, yet among the Tagans, theof the Eaft Indies. 5 ie the Illand Savor is accounted holy, and great Numbers of 'fougies go yearly thither \n the n- Months of November and. December^ to wor ld lliip and wafh in Salt-water, tho' many le of them fall Sacrifices to the hungry fe Tigers. re The firft fafe anchoring Place in the Ri- ht ver, is off the Mouih ofaRiver about twelve 80 Leagues above Sagor, commonly known by 45: the Name of Rogues River, which had that th Appellation from fome Banditti c Portugtiez&gt;e 9 e- who were Followers of Sultan Sujah, wiien ut Emirjemal, Aurengz&gt;eb\ General, drove that m unfortunate Prince out of his Province of Is, Bengal, for thofe Tortugueze having no Way p- to lublift, after their Mailer's Flight to the ks Kingdom of Arackan, betook themfelves to er Piracy among the lllands,at the Mouth oi Gan~ of ges\ and that River having Communication ile with all the Chanels from Xatigam to the Is, wellward, from this River they ufcd to fally or out, and commit Depredations on thofe that e- traded in the River of Hughly. or About 5 Leagues farther up, on the Weil fie Side of the River of Hughly, is another Branch of the Ganges, called Ganga, it is broa- Is, der than that of itnghly, but much fhallower, at and more incumbred with Sand Banks; a a- little below the Mouth of it the 'Danes have a ti- thatcht Houfe, but for what Reafons they 1- kept an Houfe there, I never could learn, /e Along the River of Hughly there are id many fmall Villages and Farms, interfperfl x, in thofe large Plains, but the firlt of any le | A 3 NotQ6 A ne-w Account Note on the River's Side, is Culculla, a Mar ket Town for Corn, coarfe Cloth, Butter, and Oyl, with other Prod udions of the Country; above it is the 'Dutch Bank/hall, a Place where their Ships ride when they cannot get farther up for the too fwift Currents of the River. Culculla has a large deep River that runs to the eaflward, and fo hzsjuanpardoay and on the Weil Side there is a River that runs by the Back of Hughly liland, which leads up to Radnagur, famous for manufadu- ring Cotton Cloth, and Silk Romaah^ or Handkerchiefs. Bujfundri antl Trejindi, or Gorgat and Cottrong, are on that River, which produce the greatelt Quantities of the bed Sugars in Bengal, A little higher up on the Eaft Side of Hughly River, is 'Ponjelly, a Village where a Corn Mart is kept once or twice in a Week, it exports more Rice than any Place on this River; and five Leagues farther up on the other Side, is Tanna Fort, built to proted the Trade of the River, at a Place convenient enough, where it is not above Half a Mile from Shore to Shore, but it ne ver was of much Ufe ; for in Anno i68(5. when the Englijh Company quarrelled with the Mogul, the Company had feveral great Ships at Hughly, and this Fort was manned in order to hinder their Paffage down the River. One 60 Gun Ship approaching pretty near the Fort, faluted it with a Broad-fide, Avhich fo frightned the Governor and his Myrmidons, that they all deferted their Pofl,of the Eaft Indies. 7 and left their Caftle to be plundred by the Envlijl) Seamen. About a League farther up on the other Side of the Ri ver &gt; 15 uernapore, where there is a little Pyramid built for a Land-mark, to confine the Com pany's Colony of Calcutta, or toit JVilharn. On that Side, and about a League farther up, Hands Fort IVtLllam. T he Englijh fettled there about the Year 1690. after the Mogul had pardoned all the Robberies and Murders committed on his Subjefts. Mr. Job Channock being then the Company's Agent in Bengal, he had Liberty to fettle an Emporium in any Part on the River's Side below Hughly, and for the fake of a large fhaddy Tree chofe that Place, tho he could not have chofen a more unhcalth- ful Place on all the River ; for three Miles to the North-eallward, is a Salt-water Lake that overflows in September and Offober then prodigious Numbers of Hfh refort thi ther, but in November and 'December when the Floods are dillipated, thoie Vifhes aie left dry, and with their Putrefaaion affed the Air with thick (linking Vapours, which the North-eall Winds bring with them to Fort William, that they caule a yearly Mor tality. One Year I was there, and there were reckoned in Augnft about noo Enghjh, feme Military, fome Servants to the Compa ny, fome private Merchants redding in the Town, and fome Seamen belonging to Ship ping lying at the Town, and before the Be ginning of January there were four hun- A &amp; fort8 A new A clred and fixty Burials regiflred in the CIerk*s Book of Mortality. Mr . Channeck choofing the Ground of the Colony, where it now is, reigned more abfolute than a Rajah, only he wanted much of their Humanity, for when any poor ignorant Native tranfgreffed his Laws, they were lure to undergo a fevere Whipping for a Penalty, and the Execution was generally done when he was at Dinner, fo near his Dining-room that the Grones and Cries of the poor Delinquent ferved him for Mu- fick. The Country about being overfpread with 'Paganifrn-y the Cuftom of W ives burning with their deceafed Husbands, is alfo pradifed here. Before the Mogul's War,Mr. went one Time with his ordinary Guard of Soldiers, to fee a you ng Wi dow a6l that tra gical Catailrophe, but he was fo fmitten with the Widow's Beauty, that he fent his Guards to taKe her by t orce from her Executioners, and conducted her to his own Lodgings, They lived lovingly many Years, and had ieveral Chilaicn, at length flie died, after Fie had fettled in (^ulcutta, but inllead of con-* verting her to Chrijiiamty, Ihe made him a Profelyte to *Pagamfhiy and the only Part of Cbrtjfianity that was remarkable in him, was burying her decently, and he built a Tomb over her, where all his Life after her Death, he kept the anniverfary Day of her Death by tncnficing a Cock on her Tomb, after the 5^ Manner j this was and is the common Re,of the Eaft Indies. p Report, and I have been credibly informed, both by Chrift'tans and 'Pagans^ who lived at Calcutta under his Agency, that the Sto ry was really true Matter of Fa6l. Fort IVtlhaW' was built an irregular Tetragon, of Brick andMorter, called Puc~ kah, which is a Compofition of Brick-duft, Lime, Malalfes, and cut Hemp, -and when it comes to be dry, is as hard and tougher than firm Stone or Brick, and the Town was built without Order, as the Builders thought moft convenient for their own Af fairs, every one taking in what Ground beft pleafed them for Gardening, fo that in mod Houfes youmuft pafs through a Garden into the Houfe, the Englijh building near the River's Side, and the Natives within Land. The Agency continued till the Year lyo^- that the old and new Companies united, and then it became a fplit Government, the old and new Companies Servants governing Week about, which made it more anarchical than regular. Sir Edward Littleton was Agent and Conful for the new Company at Hughly, when this Union of the Companies was made, and then he was ordered to re move his Faftory to Calcutta, and being of an indolent Difpofition, had let his Accounts with the Company run behind. He was fu- fpended, but lived at Calcutta till 1707. that he died there ; he was the only Prefident or Precedent in the Company's Service, that loll an Eftate of 700 Pounds per Annum in fo profitable a Poll in their Service, This10 A nem Account This double-headed Government conti nued in Calcutta, till January 1709. that Mr. W 1 eldon arrived with the Company's Com- miflion to fettle it at Bombay and Fort St. George, which were under the Management of a Governor and Council, which thofe of the Direftion in England took to be a better Way to promote their own Creatures, as well as their own Interell. His Term of governing was very fliort, and he took as fhort a \V ay to be enriched by it, by harafTing the Peo ple to fill his Coffers. There was one fmgu- lar Inftance of it. A poor Seaman had got a pretty Mujlice Wife, a little inclined to Lewd- nefs in her Husband's Abfence. She enter tained two Armenians, whq were like to quarrel about iliaring her Favours, which co ming to the Governor's Ears, he reprimand ed them: However, by t he ftrong Peifwa- lion ot 500 Rupees paid in hand by one of them, he awarded him to have the fole Right to her, and he carried her to Hughly, and bragg'd openly what his Purchafe had colt him, to the great Credit and Praife of the Governor; and when the poor Husband re turned, he was forced to fubmit to lole his Mare,, under the Pain of Flagellation : Yet he was very fhy in taking Bribes, referring thofe honeft Folks, who traffick'd that Way, to the Difcretion of his Wife and Daughter, to make the belt Bargain they could about the Sum to be paid, and to pay the Money into their Hands. I could give many Inftan- ces of the Force of Bribery, both here and - - elfe-of the Eaft Indies, I f clfewhere in India, but am loth to ruffle the Skin of old Sores. About fifty Yards from Fort William^ ftands the Church built by the pious Charity of Merchants refiding there, and the Chri- Jiian Benevolence of Sea-faring Men, whofe Affairs call them to trade there; but Mini- flers of the Gofpel being fubjeft to Mortali ty, very often young Merchants are obliged to officiate, and have a Salary of 50 L. per Annum added to what the Company allows them, for their Pains in reading Prayers and Sermons on Sundays. The Governor's Houfe, in the F ort, is the bell and mod regular Piece of Archite- dure that I ever faw in India. And there are many convenient Lodgings for Faftors and Writers, within the Fort, and fome Store-houfes for the Company's Goods, and the Magazines for their Ammunition. The Company has a pretty good Hofpi- tal at Calcutta, where many go in to un dergo the Penance of Phylick, but few come out to give Account of its Operation. The Company has alfo a pretty good Garden, that furniihes the Governor's Table with Herbage and Fruits; and fome Filh-ponds to ferve his Kitchin with good Carp, Cal- kops and Mullet. Most of the Inhabitants of Calcutta that make any tolerable Figure, have the fame Advantages; and all Sorts of Provifions, both wild and tame, being plentiful, good and cheap, as well as Clothing, make the Coun^IZ A new Account Country very agreeable, notwithftanding the above mentioned Inconveniencies that attend it. On the other Side df the River are Docks made for repairing and fitting their Ships Bottoms, and a pretty good Garden belong ing to the Armenians^ that had been a better Place to have built their Fort and Town in, for many Reafons. One is, that, where it now ihnds, the After-noon's Sun is full in the Fronts of the Houfes, and fliines hot on the Streets, that are both above and below the Fort, the Sun would have fent its hoc Rays on the Back of the Houfes, and the Fronts had been a good Shade for the Streets. Most Gentlemen and Ladies in Bengal live both fplendidly and pleafantly, the Fore^ noons being dedicated to Bufinefs, and after Dinner to Relt, an d in the Ev ening to re create themfelves in Chaifes or TaUnkms in the Fields, or to Gardens, or by Water in their Budgeroes, which is a convenient Boat, that goes fwiftly with the Force of Oars ; and, on the River, fometimes there is the Diverfion of Filhing or Fowling, or both; and, before Night, they make friendly Vi- fits to one another, when Pride or Conten tion do not fpoil Society, which too often they do among the Ladies, as Difcord and Fatfion do among the Men. And alt ho' the confcript Fathers of the Colony difagree in many Points among themfelves, yet they ail agree in oppreffing Strangers, who are coniigned to them, not fuffering them to buy orof the Eaft Indies. 15 &lt;5r fell their Goods at the moll advantageous Markets, but of the Governor and his Coun cil, who fix their own Prices, high or low, as feemeth belt to their Wifdom and Difcreti- on: And it is a Crime hardly pardonable for a private Merchant to go to Hughly, to in form himfelf of the current Prices of Goods, altho' the Liberty of buying and felling is intirely taken from him before. The Garifon of Fort fVzlliam generzWy con fills of x or 300 Soldiers, more for to convey their Fleet from Tatana^ with the Company's Saltpetre, and Piece Goods, raw Silk and fome Ophium belonging to other Merchants, than for the Defence of the Fort, for, as the Company holds their Colony in fie Tail of the Moguls they need not be a- fraid of any Enemies coming to difpolfefs them. And if they Ihoutd, at any Time, quarrel again with the Mogul, his prohibiting his Subjeds to trade with the Company, would foon end the Quarrel. There are fome impertinent troublefom Rajahs, whofe Territories ly on the Banks of the Ganges, bet wen Tat ana and Cajfembu* zaar, who pretend a Tax on all Goods and Merchandize, that pafs by, or through their Dominions on the River, and often raife For ces to compel Payment; but fome Forces from Fort fV'tlltam in Boats, generally clear the PaiTage, tho' 1 have known fome of our Men killed in the Skirmillies. I n Calcutta all Religions are freely tolera ted, but the Treshyterian, and that they brow-14 A new Account brow-beat. The 'Pagans carry their Idols in Proceflion thro' the Town. The Roman Catho~ licks have their Church to lodge their Idols in, and the Mahometan is not difcountenanc- ed ; but there are no Polemicks, except what are between our High-church Men and our low, or between the Governor's Party and o- ther private Merchants on Points of Trade. The Colony has very little Manufactory of its own, for the Government being pret ty arbitrary, difcourages Ingenuity and Indu- Itry in the Populace; for, by the Weight of the Company's Authority, if a Native chan ces to difoblige one of the Upper-houfe, he is liable to arbitrary Punifliment, either by Fine, Imprifonment or corporal Sufferings. I will give one Inftance, out of many, that I knew of the Injuflice of a Governor of the double-headed Government in Anno 1706. There was one Captain 'F err in Mailer of a Ship, who took up about 5-00 L. on re- Jpondentia from Mr. Ralph Sheldon one of the Governors, on a Voyage to Ter/la, pay able at his Return to Bengal. Terrin hav ing difpatched his Affairs in Terfia fooner than he expefted, called at Goa in his Way Home, and bought a Surat-hm\t Ship very cheap, and carried her to Calecut, and took in a Quantity of Pepper for the Mar ket ; and having brought in his other Ship, ood Store of Ter/ia Wines, called at Fort t. George to difpofe of what he could there, but finding no Encouragement from that Market, carried it to Bengal t On his Arri valAim of the Eaft Indies. 15 val he complimented Mr. Sheldon with the Offer of his Pepper and W ine, but he decli ned meddling with that Bargain, farther than with as much of the Pepper, at the current Price, as would balance his Account of Prin cipal and reffondentia. Accordingly Terr in delivered fo much Pepper, and, on the De livery, required his Bond up, but the Go vernor told him, that he being a Fellow troubled with the Spirit of interlopping in buying Goods, and taking Freights where he could bell get them, he would keep that Bond as a Curb on him, that he fhould not fpoil his Markets for the future. Poor Ter* rin ufed all his Rhetorick to get his Bond up, but to no Purpofe; and the Governor moreover gave his Wine a bad Name, fo that he could not difpofe of that either, and all this Opprellion was in order to flraitea him, that he might be obliged to fell his new purchafed Ship, at a low Price, to him and his AfTociates, which, at laft, he was ob liged to do, holding a Quarter Part in his own Hands, to fecure the Command of her to himfelf, which, after all, he could hardly do. Terrin made his Complaint to me, but I was in no Condition to affill: him, becaufe I, having three or four large Ships at Bengal^ was reckoned a Criminal guilty of that un pardonable Sin of Interlopping ; however, I advifed Terr'tn to comply with his inexor able Mailer, on any Terms of Agreement whatfoever, which he endeavoured to do, that he might, at leaft, keep the Command ©fJ 6 A new A of his Ship, where he was lo much concern^ ed, and had hardly done it, but by Acci dent. One Day meeting me on the Green near the Fort, he llopt me to relate his Grievances, and begged, that, if he was tur ned out of his own Ship, he might have an Employ in one of mine, which I promifed he fhould. Sheldon efpied us, out of a Window, hoN ding a long Confabulation, and being impati ent to know about what, fent a Servant to call 'Perrin, and he, obeying the Summons^ was interrogated about what our Difcourfe was; and he told the Promife I had made him. Sheldon told him, that he was as cap able to employ him, as I could be. ^Perrm anfwered, that he knew that, but wilhed that he would be as willing too; fo Sheldon promifed that he fhould command his own Ship to Terfia. B ut the Wine ftill lay unfold, tho' it was fcarce then in Bengal ; but the Name that it got, fir it at Port St. George, and afterward in Fort JVilham, ftuck fo faft to it, that none of it would go off at any Price, fo I advifed him to carry it off in the Night, in my Boats, on board of one of my Ships, and I would try if I could ferve him in felling it, which accordingly he did, and two Gentlemen of the Council, being that Seafon bound for England, coming one Day to dine with me, 1 treated them, and the reft of my Companv, with that iP erfia W ine, which they all praif- ed, and askt me where I got it.. I told them, that,of the Eaft Indies. that, knowing that good Wines would be fcarce at Bengal that Year, I had provided a good Quantity at Surat, from whence I had come that Seafon. Every one begged that I would fpare them fome Chefts, which I con- defcended to do as a Favour, and next Day Tent them what they wanted, at double the Price the Owner demanded for it, while he had it, andfo got off above noChefls, which enabled Mr. Terrin to fatisfy moll: of his Creditors. Sheldon provided a Stock and Freight for Terr in to Terfia, and put on board fome rotten long Pepper, that he could difpofe of no other Way, and fome damaged Gunnies, which are much in Ufe in Terfia for embal- ing Goods, when they are good in their Kind; but, nolens volens, Terr in mufl take them, and lign Bills of Loading for good well conditioned Goods; and yet, after he was ready to fail, he had been flopt, if he could not raife the Sum of 2500 Rupees, to difcharge a Bill, that, at that Time, became due, and was indorfed to Sheldon. I alfo helped him out of that Difficulty, and took his Bond for the Sum, bearing Intereft from the Date, at the current Intereft of 1 per Cent, per Men fern, fo Terrin proceeded on his Voyage to Terjidy but called at Calecut in his Way Home again, and laid up his Ship there, and took Protedion of a Nayer, with the full Hand of 11000 L, Sterl. of Ben~ gal Money, and wrote to Mr. Sheldon, that he might keep bis former Bond, and he would B take18 A new Account take Care of his Part of the Stock in his Hands. He alfo wrote to me, that he would take particular Care to reimburfe me, but, in a fhort Time after, he died, and his Ef- fefts came into the Englijh Chief's Hands, who detained them feveral Years, denying that ever he had any, till Governor Boone came to the Government of Bombay miy 15. and then he made a lame Account. I have been fo prolix and particular in this Story, that it may form an Idea of the Deformity and difmal Image of Tyranny and Villany fup- ported by a Power, that neither divine nor human Laws have Force enough to bridle or reftrain. The Company's Colony is limited by a Land-mark at Governapore, and another near Barnagul, about fix Miles diftant ; and the Salt-water Lake bounds it on the Land Side. It may contain, in all^ about 10 or nooo Souls ; and the Company's Revenues are pretty good, and well paid. They rife from Ground-rents and Confulage on all Goods imported and exported by Briujh Subjeds; but all Nations befides are free from Taxes. CHAP. XXXIV. Is a Continuation of the Defcr'iftion ^/Bengal. BARNAGpJ L is the next Village on the River's Side, above Calcutta^ where tne T)ntch have an Houfe and Garden; and theof the Eaft Indies. 19 the Town is famoufly infamous for a Semi nary of female Lewdnefs, where Numbers of Girls are trained up for the Deflruftion of unwary Youths, who ftudy more how to gratify their brutal Paflions, than how to Ihun the evil Confequences that attend their tolly, notwithftanding the daily Inftances of Rottennefs and Mortality that happen to thofe who mofl frequent thofe Schools of Debauchery. The 'Dutch Shipping anchors there fometimes, to take in their Cargoes for Batavia. And thofe are all that are remark able at Barnagul or Barnagur. There are feveral other Villages on the River's Sides, in the W ay to Hughly, which lies 20 Miles above Barnaguly but none re markable, till we come to the 'Danes Facto ry, which ftands about four Miles below Hughly? but the Poverty of the Danes has made them defert it, after having robbed the Mogul's Subjeds of fome of their Shipping, to keep themfelves from flar- ving. Almost oppofite to the Danes Fadory is Bankebankfal, a Place where the Oft end Company fettled a Factory, but, in Anno i? 2 '3- they quarrelled with the Fouzdaar or Governor ot Hughly, and he forced the O- ftenders to quit their Faftory, and feek Protection from the French at Charnagur, where their Fadory is, but, for Want of Money, are not in a Capacity to trade. They have a few private Families dwelling near the Factory, and a-pretty little Church to B % hearzo A new Account hear Mafs in, which is the chief Bufinefs of the French in Bengal. About half a League farther up is the Chincbura^\\trc the 'Dutch Emporium (lands. It is a large Factory, walled high with Brick, And the Favors have a great many good Houfes {landing pleafantly on the River's Side ; and all of them have pretty Gardens to their Houfes. The Chinchura is wholly un der the Dutch Company's Government. It is about a Mile long, and about the fame Breadth, well inhabited by Armenians and the Na tives. It is contiguous to Hughly, and affords Sanftuary for many poor Natives, when they are in Danger of being opprefl by the Mo- gul\ Governor, or his Harpies, Hughly is a Town of a large Extent, but •ill built. It reaches about x Miles along the River's Side, from the Chinchura before men tioned to the Ban del, a Colony formerly fet tled by the 'Portugueze, but the Mogul's JFouzdaar governs both at prefent. This Town of Hughly drives a great Trade, be- caufe all foreign Goods are brought thither for Import, and all Goods of the Produ6l of Bengal are brought hither for Exportation. And the Mogul's Furza or Cuftom-houfe is at this Place. It affords rich Cargoes for fifty or fixty Ships yearly, beHdes what is carried to neighbouring Countries in fmall Veffels ; cmd there are Veflels that bring Salt-petre from 'Fatana, above 5-0 Yards long, and 5 broad, and two and an half deep, and can carry above 200 Tuns. They come down in the MonthMi of the Eaft Indies. 11 Month of Ottober^ before the Stream of the River, but are obliged to track them up a- gain, with Strength of Hand, about 1000 Miles. T o mention all the particular Species of Goods that this rich Country produces, is far beyond my Skill; but, in our Eaji-india Company's Sales, all the Sorts, that are fent hence to Eti~ rope, ma^ be found; but Ophium, long Pep per and Ginger are Commodities that the tra ding Shipping in India deals in, befides To bacco, and many Sorts of Piece Goods, that are not merchantable in Europe. The Bandel, at prefent, deals in no Sort of Commodities, but what are in Requell at the Court of Venm^ and they have a Church, where the Owners of fuch Goods and Mer chandize are to be met with, and the Buyer may be conduced to proper Shops, where the Commodities may be feen and felt, and a Pried to be Security for the Soundnefs of the Goods. Now this being my fartheft Travels up the famous Ganges, I muft advance farther on the Report of others, and r o I begin with Qajjembazaar, about 100 Miles above Hugh- /y, where the Englijh and Ttutch have their refpedive Faftories; and, by their Compa nies Orders, the Seconds of Council ought to be Chiefs of thofe Fadories. The Town is large, and much frequented by Merchants, which never fails of making a Place rich. The Country about it is very healthful and fruitful, and produces induftrious People, who cultivate many valuable Manufadories. B 3 Mux-11 A nemo Account Muxadabaud is but Miles from it, a Place of much greater Antiquity, and the Mogul has a Mint there; but the ancient Name of Muxadabaud is changed for Rajah- mal, for above a Century. It was, in for mer Times, the greateft Place of Trade and Commerce on the Ganges&gt; but now its Trade and Grandeur adorns Cajfembazaar. About forty or fifty Miles to the Eaft- ward of Rajahmal, on another Chanel of the Ganges, is Maldo, a large Town, well inha bited and frequented by Merchants, and the Englifh and ^Dutch had Fadories there, but whether they are continued ftill, I know not. Tat an a is the next Town frequented by Europeans, where the Engltjh and Dutch have Fadories for Salt-petre and raw Silk. It produces alfo fo much Opium, that it ferves all the Countries in India with that Com modity. It is the Place of Refidence of the Prince of Bengal, who is always of the Blood Royal. The Town is large, but the FJoufes built at fome Diftance from one another. The Country is pleafant and fruitful; and the Town lies in 26 Degrees of Latitude to the Northward of the TFquator. Bannaras lies about 100 Miles farther up the River, celebrated for its Santlity by all Perfons over India, where 'Paganifm pre vails. Flere are Seminaries and Univerfities for the Education of Youth, and to initiate them into the Myfteries of their Religion. Aurengzeb retrained the Prieils from (hew ing the Madnefs of their Zeal, for they found outof the Eaft Indies. 15 out fome weak Dotards, who, for Oilentati- on, would go to the Top of an high Tower, and leap down where divers pointed Weapons were placed in the Spot they were to fall on, and among them they ended their filly Lives. It is (till in fo much Veneration, that I have known young and old Banyans go from Su- rat thither over Land, out of Devotion, which is computed to be 400 Miles. The Priefls fill Brafs and Copper Pots, made in the Shape of fhort-necked Bottles, with Ganges's Water, which they confecrate and feal up, apd fend thofe Bottles, which contain about 4 Englijh Gallons, all over India, to their Benefaaors, who make them good Returns, for whoever is wafht with that Water juft before they ex pire, are waflit as clean from their Sins as a new-born Babe. : I have ventured fo far into this Terra in cognita on the Ganges, that I dare venture no farther, but mull vifit Hacca, which lies un der the Tropick of Cancer, on the broadeft and eaflermoft Branch of Ganges. The Ci ty is the largeft in Bengal, and it manufactures Cotton and Silk the beft and cheapeft. The Plenty and Cheapnefs of Provillons are in credible, and the Country is full of Inhabi tants, but it breeds none of tolerable Cou rage, for five or fix armed Men will chafe a Thoufand: Yet, about two Centuries ago, 'Dacca had its own Kings, but when Jehau Guire, the King of Mogul, over-ran Bengal with a vidorious Army, a Detatchment of 20000 Men was fent down to Ttacca, on B 4 wnofcmmm H new Actount whofe Approach the poor King furrendred his Kingdom, without once drawing his Sword in its Defence, and fo it eafily be came annext to the Mogul's Dominions. That Branch of the Ganges difembogues into the Sea at Chittagoung, or, as the 'For- tugueze call it, Xatigam, about 50 Leagues below 'Dacca ; and this Place confines the Mogul's Dominions to the Eaftward. The Diltance between tS^rthe weftermoft Cha nel of the Ganges^ and Xatigam the eailer- tnoll, is about 100 Leagues, the maritim Coaft being divided iilto many fmall Iflands made by the Currents of the Ganges, but ve ry few are inhabited, becaufe they are fo pe ered wkh Tigers, that there is little Safety tor other Inhabitifnts; and there are alfo ma ny Rhinocerofes on thofe Iflands, but they are not fo dangerous Neighbours as the Ti gers, yet, when provoked, they will aflault aily living Thing. Nature has endued him with two particular Rarities out of her Stores. One is a large Horn placed on his Nbfe. The iecond is a Coat of Mail to defend him frotn the Teeth or Claws of other fierce Animals; His Tongue is alfo fomewhat of a Rarity, tor, if he can but get any of his Antagonifts down, he will lick them fo clean, that he leaves neither Skin nor -Hefh to cover their Bones; but he i$ feldom known to be an Ag- grelfor, except when he meets with an Ele phant, then he fharpens his Horn and alTaults, tho he is much inferior to the Elephant in Bulk and Strength, being no bigger than a veryof the Eaft Indies. 15 very large Ox, yet he often overcomes in fpiteof the Elephant's Teeth. Sund'tva is an Ifland four Leagues diftant from the reft, and fo far it lies in the Sea, it is about xo Leagues inCircumferehce,and has three Fathoms Water within a Mile of the Shore, and it may ferve to fhelter fmall Ships from the raging Seas, and Winds of the South-well Monfoons. I was credibly infqr- med by one that wintred there, that he bought 580 Pound Weight of Rice for a Rupee, or Half a Crown, eight Geefe for the fame Money, and fixty good tame Poul try for the fame, and Cloth is alfo incredibly cheap, it is but thinly inhabited, but the Peo ple fimple and honelt. The Religion of Bengal by Law eftabli- flied, is Mahometan^ yet for one Mahometan there are above an Hundred Tngans, and the publick Offices and Pofts of Truft are filled promifcuoufly with Men of both Per- fwalions. The Gentiles are better contented to live under the Moguls Laws than under Ta- gan Princes, for the Mogul them gently, and every one knows what he muft pay, but the Tagan Kings or Princes tax at Difcre- tion, making their own Avarice the Stan dard of Equity ; befides there were former ly many fmall Rajahs, that ufed, upon frivo lous Occafions, to pick Quarrels with one another, and before they could be made I' riends again, their Subjeas were forced to openWki. 16 A new Account open both their Veins and Purfes togratifie Ambition or Folly. And now having curforily travelled over the mod noted Countries and Towns in Bengal, with the bell Remarks I could of their Government, only making a voluntary Omiffion of many Oppreflions and other In- juftices that came within the Reach of my own Knowledge and Experiments, I take Leave of that earthly Paradife,and proceed. CHAP. XXXV.

It was here that the Tortu- gueze firft fettled in Bengal, but the Dangers their Ships run in coming thither in the South-weft Monfoons, made them remove to the Bandel at Hughly. The Mogul keeps a Cadjee or Judge in it, to adminifter Jullice among the Tagan and Mahometan Inhabi tants, but the Offspring of thofe Tortugueze that followed the Fortune of Sultan Sujah, when he was forced to quit Bengal, -are the domineering Lords of it. Itcf the Eaft Indies. i-j It is not fo fertil in Corn as Bengal, and has but few Cotton Manufadories, but it af fords the bed Timber for building, of any Place about it. The River has a deep enough Entrance, but is peflered with Sand Banks, and fome Rocks within. I have known fome Englijh Ships forced from Point Talme'tra by Strefs of Weather thither, and had fafe riding till the North-eaft Monfoons came to relieve them. The Government is fo anar chical, that every one goes armed with Sword, Piftol, and Blunderbufli, nay, even the Priefts are obliged to go armed, and often ufe their Arms to as bad Ends as the licentious Laity, and fome of the Priefts have died Mar tyrs to villainous Adions. Arackan is the next maritim Country to the Southward of Bengal, and in former Times made fome Figure in Trade. It was into this Country that the unfortunate Sultan Sujahctme a Supplicant for Protedion, when Emirjemal chafed him out of Bengal. He car ried his Wives and Children with him, and about Two hundred of his Retinue, who were refolved to follow his Fortune, and he carried fix or eight Camels Load of Gold and Jewels which proved his Ruin, and in the End, the Ruin of the Kingdom of A~ rackan. \V hen Sultan Sujah firft vifited the Kin5 of Arackan, he made him Prefents fuitablc to the Quality of the Donor and Receiver, the Arackaner promifmg him all the Civili ties due to fo great a Prince, with a fafe Afylnmz8 A new A Afylum for himfelf and Family; When E* mtrjcmal knew where Sultan Sujah had ta« ken Sanduary, he fent a Letter to the King of Arackan, wherein he demanded the poor diftreft Prince to be delivered up to him, o- therwife he threatned to bring his Army in to his Country to take him by Force. The threatning Letter wrought fo far on the bafe Arackaner, that he contrived Ways and Means to pick a Quarrel with his Gueft, to have a Pretext to oblige Emirjemal, at lafl he found a very fair one. Sultan Sujah having a very beautiful Daughter, the King of Arackan defired her in Marriage, but knew well enough that Sul tan Sujah would never confent to the Match, he being a 'Pagan and fhe a Mahometan. Her Father ufed all reafonable Arguments to dif- fwade the Arackaner from profecuting his Suit, but in vain, for the Arackaner grew daily more prefling, and Sultan Sujah at M gave him a flat Denial, on which the bafe King fent him Orders to go out of his Do minions in Three Days, and forbad the Mar kets to furnirti him any more with Provifions for his Money. Sultan Sujah knowing it would be Death for him to go back to Ben gal, refolved to pafs over fome Mountains overgrown with Woods, into the King of gu\ Dominions, which were not above 100 Miles off, and fo next Day after Summons, with his Family, Treafure, and Attendants, Sultan began his March, but the bar barous Arackaner fent a ftrong Party after him, him ced Sul Tre ous and a a in t ftro Wc allei Ben favs c c.

What became of Sultan Sujah and his fair Daughter, none could ever give ^ a certain Account; whether they were killed in the Skirmilli, or whether they were de- ,a ^ ftroyed by wild Elephants and Tigers in the Woods, none ever knew, but the Arackaners 2 all edge they were deftroyed by the wild Beads of the Woods, and not by the more . f , lavage Beafts in human Shape. I Ui S o much Treafure never had been feenin Arackan before, but to whom it Ihould be- T' long caufed fome Difturbance. The King t thought that all belonged to him, thofe that 1fought for it claimed a Share, and the Prin- j ces of the Blood wanted fome fine large Dia- monds for their Ladies, but the Tribe oiLe- yi found a Way to make up the Difference, r and perfwaded the King and the other Pre- f 1 tenders, to dedicate it to the God Dagun, who was the titular God of the Kingdom, ar ' and to depofitate it in his Temple, which all agreed to; now whether this be the fame 'Dagon of AJhdod, mentioned in the firft Book and fifth Chapter of Samuel, I do not certainly know, but Uagun has a large Tem ple in Arackan, that I have heard of, and a- nother in ^egu that Ihavefeen. II ^ I In 1690. a King of dying without Iffue, two Princes of the Blood quarrelled about filling up of the Vacancy, they both :er took m,jo A new A took Arms, and both had an Eye upon the Treafure, which fo frightned the Priefthood, that they removed Sultan Sujatis Treafure to another Place only known to themfelves; and thofe two hot Blades purfued their Quarrel fo warmly, that in one Year them felves and Families were intirely cut off, and the Kingdom has continued in Anarchy e^ ver fince. Arackan has the Conveniency of a noble fpacious River, and its Mouth is both large and deep enough to accommodate Ships of the greateft Burden into a fpacious Har bour, large enough to hold all the Ships in Europe. W hen the Engtijh left Bengal in Anno 168(5. Mr. Channock came thither with Half a Dozen of great Ships, to pafs the South- wefl Monfoons away, the Country afllfted them plentifully with Provifions, but they had no other Commerce; they had no lefs than lix Fathoms Water going in to the River, and in fome Places within, above twenty. The Country produces Timber for building, fome Lead, Tin, Stick-lack, and Elephants Teeth. The Sea Coaft of Arackan reaches from Xatigam to Cape Negrais, about 400 Miles in Length, but few Places inhabited, becaufe there are fuch vaft Numbers of wild Ele phants and Buffaloes, that would deftroy the Productions of the Ground, and Tigers to deftroy the tame Animals, that they think it impra&amp;icable to inhabit it, only fome Iflands in the Sea are peopled with fome poor mi- ferableof the Eaft Indies. ferable Fiftiers, who get their Bread out of the Water, to keep them from flarving, and they live out of the Way of Oppref- fion. T h e r e are fome of the Mogul's Subje6h who trade to Arackan for the Commodities above mentioned, and fometimes they meet with good Bargains of Diamonds, Rubies, precious Stones, and Gold Rupees, which are to be fuppofed are fome of Sultan Su' jah\ Treafure, pilfered by the avaricious Priefts. T h e r e are abundance of Iflands on the Arackan Coait, but they lie clofe to the Shore, only the Buffalo Iflands lie about four Leagues off, and there is a Rock that ihews its Head above Water about the Middle of the Chanel, between thofe Iflands and the Continent.

The other Ifland of Negrats y which makes the Point called the Cape, is a fmall, low, barren rocky Ifland, it is often called Ifland, becaufe its Shape is a Rhombus. About the Year 1704. four French Ships went to careen at the great Negrais, and turning in between the Iflands, one Ship of 70 Guns called L' In- dteny run aground on fome Rocks lying on thejz A new Account the Infide of 'Diamond Ifland, and was loft, but the reft faved the Men, and all her por table Furniture.

Vol.11 Th*^ A new Account The ancient City of Tegu (lands about forty Miles to the Eaftward of Syrian, the Ditches that furrounded the City, which are now dry, and bear good Corn, teililie that few Cities in the World exceeded it in Magnitude, for they are reckoned fix or fe- vcn Leagues round their outward Polygon. I t was the Seat of many great and puilfant Kings, who made as great a Figure as any in the Eaft, but now its Glory is in the Duil, for not one twentieth Part of it is inhabited, and thofc are but the lower Clafs of People who inhabit it. The Caufe of the Ruin ot the Kingdoms of 'Vegu, Martavan, and tome others under the Dominions of Tegu, I had from fome Teguers, in feveral Dhcourfes with them about that Revolution, which was thus. There was great Love and Friendfhip belween the Kings andSubjedsof Tegu and Siam* being next Neighbours to one another, and they had a good Intercourfe of Trade, both by Land and Sea, till in the fifteenth Century, a Tegu Veffel being at Odia the chief City of Siam, and when ready to de part for Tegu, anchored one Evening near a little Temple a few Miles below the City, and the Matter of the Veflel, with fome of his Crew, going to wor/hip in that Temple, feeing a pretty well carv'd Image of the God Sam/ay, about a Covet high, fell in Love with it, and finding his Priefts negligent in watching, ftole him away, and carried him on board Prifoner for Tegu.

The King ofTegu being as great a Bigot as his Brother pf Siam, would by no Means deliver back a God who had fled from the Impieties of his native Land to him for Pro- ted ion, and with that Anfwer fent back the J/^Amballador, who was not a little mor tified with the Difappointment. S1 n c e fair Means could not perfwade the Teguer to fend back the little God, the Si~ amer was refolved to try what Force would do, and accordingly railed an Army of two or three hundred thoufand Men to invade the King of Tegtis Dominions, and the firft Fury of the War fell on the Province of Martavan, being contiguous to the Terri tories of Siam, and with Fire and Sword de- llroyed the open Country almoft to the Gates of the City of where often tV ^ ijuw^5 Account the King of Teeu kept his Court, and was formerly the Nlecropolis of an independent Kingdom, before Tegu reduced that Country by fionqueft to be a Province of theirs. A fter the Sidyyisv had latiated his Cru elty and Rage, by the Dellruftion of many poor Innocents, he retired back to his own Country very much elevated with Pride and Vain-glory for his great Atchievements, but next Year he was pretty well humbled, for the Teguer raifed a much greater Army, and embarking them in fmall Boats on the River Memnon, on which the City of Odia ftands in one of its Iflands, his Army was brought with fo much Celerity and Secrecy, that the Tevuer brought the firft News of his Invafi- on^ and pitching his Tents round the City, foon brought it into great Straits, by flopping the daily Provilions that fupported itj but un expectedly the River bringing down great Floods of Waters, Iboner than their ordinary Time, the Country about the City overflow ed, and fpoilt all the Teguer\ Provifions of Corn, and drowned near the Half of his Ar my, which obliged him to raife the Siege, and retire to his own Dominions. Next Year, the Siamer, to be revenged, levied another great Army, with which he over-ran all the inland Countries of Tegu that lay near him, and annext them to his own Dominions. The Teguer finding that he could not recover his Lands without foreign Aid and Afiiflance, invited the ''For- tuqt{eze r whofe Name began to be dreadful inof the Eaft Indies. 37 in India, and by the great Encouragement he gave them, got about 1000 Volunteers into his Service. Neither the Stamers wo? the c Pe- guers at that Time underftood the Ufe of Fire Arms, and their Noife and Execution at fo great a Diftance terrified them. \\ ith the 'Tortu^ueze Alfiflance, the 'Peguer went with his Army, which was very numerous, to find out the S'tamer^ and having found him, gave him Battle, the Portuguese being in the Front with their Fire Arms, foon put the Stamer to Flight before they could come to Handy-blows, on which he left the Pe- guers Country in greater Hafte than he (?ame into it. The King of Tegu was fo fenfible of the c Portugueze Service in gaining the Battle, and driving the Stamers out oi his conquered Country, that he made one Senhor Thoma Tereyra (who commanded the Portugueze in the War) Generaliflimo of all his Forces, which Preferment made the Portugueze fo infolent, that in a few Years they became intolerable to all Ranks and Degrees of Per- fons in P'egu. Both Kings grew tired of War, but both too proud to make Advances toward Peace, fo that for many Years they had skirmifhing with fmall Parties, tho' no fet Battles, and where ever the Portugueze Arms went, they had Vidory to accompany them. The King of Pegu, to have his Forces nearer the Borders of Siant^ fettled his Court at Martavan, and kept the Portugueze near C 3 him.5 8 J new him, to be ready on all Occafions, either to repel or affault the Siam Forces, as Oppor tunity ferved, and Thoma 'Pereyra was the darling Favourite at Court, he had his Ele phants of State, and a Guard of his own Countrymen to attend him. One Day as he was coming from Court in State, on a large Elephant, towards his own Palace, he chanced to hearMufick in a Burgher's Houfe, whofe Daughter being a very beautiful Virgin, had been married that Morning to a young Man of the Neighbourhood. The General went to the Houfe and wiflied them Joy, and defired to fee the Bride. The Parents took the Ge- neral's Vilit for a great Honour done them, and brought their Daughter to his Elephant's Side ; he being fmitten with her Beauty, or dered his Guard to feize her and carry her to his Houfe. H i s Orders were but too readily obeyed, and the poor Bridegroom not being able to hear his Lofs, cut his own Throat, and the dilconfolate Parents of their injured Children, rent their Clothes, and went crying and com plaining through the Streets towards the Kings Palace, imploring their Gods and Country-men to avenge them on the infolent 'PortU£uejze,the common Oppreflbrs of their Country. Crowds of People came from all Parts of the City to hear and fee the Trage dy, their Numbers grew fo great, that the Streets were hardly big enough for them, and their Noife fo loud that it reached the King's Ears, whofent to know the Caufe of theifof the Eaft Indies. ^9 their Uprore.

The King's Or ders were put in Execution fo fpeedily, that in a few Hours all the Tortugueze were flaughtered, and the guilty Criminal was ta ken alive, and made fad by the Heels to an Elephant's Foot,'who dragged him through the Streets till there was no Skin nor Flefli left to cover his Bones, which Speftacle ap- peafed the enraged Populace. There were only three Tortugueze faved, who were ac cidentally in the Suburbs next the River, who hid themfelves till Night favoured their E- fcape in a fmall Boat, in which they coafted along the Shore, feeding on what the Woods and Rocks afforded them, and at length ar rived at Malaccdy to give an Account of the melancholy Scene. Both Kingdoms being much weakned with bloody Wars, took Rell for many Years, but never entred on Treaties ofPeace. So about the Middle of the feventecnth Ccn- C 4 tury40 ji new Account; tury, the Siamer invaded the Dominions of Tegu, and conquered all to the Southward of Martauan, taking in the Provinces of Tanacerin and Ligore^ who were Tributaries to Tegu, and retains them fHllin his Poiref- fion. The King of *Pegu finding that the In- croachments of Si am daily leffened his Do- minions, and his own. Forces were not able to proted what he had left, fent an EmhafTy to the King of a potent Prince, whofe Dominions lay about 5*00 Miles up the River from Tegu^ to beg his Afliftance to flop the Siamers in their Courfe of Conquells, and he promifed to give good Encouragement to the Barmaes. The EmbafTy was gracioufly received, and an Army of an hundred thou- fand was levied for that Service, and fent on tranfport Veflels to and joyned the Tegu Army, who conjun&amp;ly marched againft the Siamer 1 and drove him quite out of his new Conquers; and when the Barmaes ob- ferved the Feeblenefs and bad Difcipline of the Tegu Army, they even killed the King of *PegUy and broke the Tegu Army, and feized the Kingdoms of Tegu and Martavan for their Mafter, and in that Family it con tinues to this Time, The Barmaes ruined both the Cities of ^Pegu and Martavan, and funk VefTels in the Mouth of the River of Martavan, to make it unnavigable, and fo it continues.

Cotton Cloths from Bengal and Chormondel, with fome {tripped Silks, are beft for their Market, and Silver of any Sort is welcome to them. It pays the King eight and an Half per Cent. Cullom, but in lieu of that high Duty, he indulges the Mer chants to melt it down, and put what Alloy they pleafe in it, and then to pafs it off in Payments as high as they can. Rupee Silver, which has no Alloy in it, will bear twenty eight per Cent, of Copper- alloy, and keep the Touch, which they call flowcr'd Silver, and if it flowers, it paffes current. Their Way to make flower'd Silver is, when the Silver and Copper are mixt and melted together, and while the Metal is liquid,of the Eaft Indies. ^ liquid, they put it into a fhallow Mould, of what Figure or Magnitude they pleafe, and before the Liquidity is gone, they blow on it through a fmall wooden Pipe, which makes the Face, or Part blown upon, appear with the Figures of Flowers or Stars, but I never faw any European or other Foreigner at have the Art to make thofe Figures ap pear, and if there is too great a Mixture of Alloy, no Figures will appear. T he King generally adds ten per Cent, on all Silver that comes into his Treafury, be- fides what was put on at firft, and tho' it be not flower d, it mud go off in all his Payments, but from any Body elfe it may be refufed if it is not flower'd. His Government is arbitrary. All his Commands are Laws, but the Reins of Go vernment are ke^pt fteady and gently in the King's own Hand. He feverely puniflies his Governors of Provinces or Towns, if Oppref- fions or other illegal Pradices are proven up on them; and to know how Affairs pafs in the State, every Province or City has a Man- dereen or Deputy reliding at Court, which is generally in the City of Ava, the prefent Me tropolis. Fvery Morning thefe Mandereens are obliged to attend at Court, and after his Ma- jefty has dreft and breakfafled, which is ge nerally on a Dilh of Rice boiled in fair Wa ter, and his Sauce is fome Shrimps dried and powder'd, and fome Salt and Cod-pep per mixt with thofe two Ingredients, and thataa A new Account; that Mixture makes a very pungent Sauce, which they call Trock^nb is in great Efteem and Ufe among the Teguers. W h en his Breakfait is over, he retires in to a Room fo contrived that he can fee all the Attendants, but none can fee him, and a Page ftands without to call whom the King would have give Account of the current News of his Province or City, which is pci- formed with profound Reverence toward the Room where the King flays, and with a diftind audible Voice ; and if any particular Matters of Confequence is forgot or omit ted, and the King comes to hear of it by a- nother Hand, fevere Punilhments follow, and fohe paiTes his Mornings in hearing the neceflary Cafes of his own Affairs as well as thofe of his Subjeds. If he is informed of Treafon, Murder,or fuch like hainous Crimes, he orders the Mat- ter to be judicially tried before Judges of his own choofing, for that Time and Affair, and on Convidion he figns the dead Warrant, wherein he orders, that the Wretch convi- fl:ed (hall trade no more on his Ground, and Execution prefently follows, either by be heading, or ordering them to be Sport for his Elephants, which is the cruelleft Death. Sometimes he baniflies them for a certain Time to the Woods, and if they are not de voured by Tigers, or killed by wiM Ele phants, they may return when their Term is expired, and pafs the Remainder of their Days in ferving a tame Elephant; and for fmallerof the Eaft Indies. 4.5 frrtaller Crimes they are only condemned to clean his Elephants Stables for Life. His Subjefts, if they may be fo called, treat him with fulfom Adulation. When they fpeak or write to him they call him their God (or in their Language K 'tack) and in his Letters to foreign Princes, he alTumes the Title of King of Kings, to whom all other Kings ought to be fubjeft, as being near Kinfman and Friend to all the Gods in Heaven and on Earth, and by their Friendfliip to him all Animals are fed and preferved, and theSea- fons of the Year are regularly kept: The Sun is his Brother, and the Moon and Stars are his near Relations, Lord over the Floods and Ebbing of the Sea ; and after all his lofty Epithets and Hyperboles, he defcends to be King of the white Elephant, and of the twen ty four white Somereroes or r Ombrellaes. Thefe two lafl he may indeed claim with fome Shew of Juftice, for I have feen Ele phants of a light yellow Colour both in Te- gu and Siam, but who ought to be called their Lord is a Queftion not yet decided ; and as King of the twenty four white Some- reroes, I believe few Kings will much care to difpute that glorious Title with him, for thofe Somereroes are only commonChinaUm- hrellaesy covered over with thin Chvrmon- del Beteellaes y and their Canes lackt and gil ded, and becaufe his own Subje^s dare not life any fuch ^Ombrellaes, he wifely lays his im perial Commands on all other Kin^s to forbear wearing of them when they go abroad. Af-4&lt;$ A nm Account Af TERhis Majefty has dined, there is a Trumpet blown, to lignifie to all his Slaves, as he terms other Kings, that they may go to Dinner, becaufe their Lord has already din ed. And when any foreign Ships arrive at Syrian, the Number of People on board, with their Age and Sex, are fent to him, to let him know that fo many of his Slaves are ar rived to partake of the Glory and Happi- nefs of his Reign and Favour, and the highefl Title his own Subjeds alTume, is the King's firll Slave. The King's Palace at Ava is very large, built of Stone, and has four Gates for its Conveniencies. AmbalTadors enter at the Eaft Gate, which is called the golden Gate, be caufe all AmbalTadors make their Way to him by Prefents. The South Gate is called the Gate of Juftice, where all People that bring Petitions, Accufations, or Complaints, enter. The Weft is the Gate of Grace, where all that have received Favours, or have been acquitted of Crimes,pafs out in State, and all condemned Perfons carried out in Fetters; and the North Gate fronting the River, is the Gate of State where his Majefty palTes through, when he thinks fit toblefs his People with his Prefence, and all his Provifions and Water are carried in at that Gate. When Pots of Water, or Baskets of Fruits are carried through the Streets for the King's Ufe, an Officer attends them, and all the People that fortune to be near, muft fall on their Knees, and let it pafsof the Eaft Indies. s a pafs by, as a good Catholick does when he fees es, the Hoft. go When an Ambaflador is admitted to Au- in- dience in the Palace, he is attended with a at large Troop of Guards, with Trumpets foun- ith ding, and Heralds proclaiming the Honour let the AmbafTador is about to receive, in going ar- to fee the Glory of the Earth, his Majefty's pi, own fweet Face, and between the Gate and eft the Head of the Stairs that lead to the Cham- g' s ber of Audience, the Amballador is attended with the Matter of the Ceremonies, who in- yej ftrudis him to kneel three Times in his Way ] rs thither, and continue fo with his Hands over aft his Head, till a Proclamation is read before )e . he dare rife. Some of his Elephants are [ m inftrufted to fall on their Belly when the King he paftes by them. n g T his Relation I had from one Mr. Roger ;r Alifon, who had been twice Ambaflador from iat the Governor of Fort St. George, or his A- ^ gents at Syrian, to the Court of Ava ; and ^ tho' the Palace is very large, yet the Buil- dings are but mean, and the City tho' great te and populous, is only built of Bambow Canes, thatcht with Straw or Reeds, and the Floors :c of Teak Plank, or fplit Bambows, becaufeif Treafon or other capital Crimes be dete^ed, the Criminals may have no Place of Shelter, 0 f for if they do not appear on the firft Sum- ^ [ mons, Fire will fetch them out of their com- n buftible Habitations. His Sword-officers have no Salary, nor j t his Soldiers for their Support, but there is fs a48 A new Account a Province or a City given to fome Minion,, who is to give Suftenance to fuch a Number of Soldiers, and find the Palace at Ava with fuch a Quota of Provifions as the Providore thinks fit to appoint. W hen there is a War, and Parties are fent on Expeditions, then the King allows them Pay, Clothes, Arms, and provides Magazines of Provifions for them; but aflbon as the War is at an End, then the Clothes and Arms are returned, by which Means Difcipline is little known among them, and a Man of a tolerable Stock of Courage may pafs there for an Hero. The Quality of an Officer is known by his Tobacco Pipe having an earthen or me- tallick Head, with a Socket to let in a joynt- ed Reed, that on its upper End has a Mouth piece of Gold, joynted as the Reed or Cane is, and by the Number of Joyntsin the golden Mouth -piece, the Quality of the OHicer is known, and Refpeft paid him accordingly. All Cities and Towns under this King's Dominions, are like ariftocraUcal Common wealths. The Prince or Governor feldorn fits in Council, but appoints his Deputy, and twelve Counfellers or Judges, and they fit once in ten Days at lead, but oftner when Bufinefs calls them. They convene in a large Hall, mounted about three Foot high, and double Benches round the Floor for People to fit or kneel on, and to hear the free De bates of Council. The Hall being built on Pil lars of Wood, is open on all Sides, and the Judges. -i'! of the Eaft Indies. ^.p Judges fet in the Middle onMatts, and fit ting in a Ring there is no Place of Prece dence ; there are no Advocates to plead at the Bar, but every one has the Privilege to plead his own Caufe, or fend it in \V riting to be read publickly, and it is determined ju dicially within the Term of three Sittings of Council, but if any one quqftions his own E- loquence, or Knowledge of the Laws of E- n, he may impower a Friend to plead im, but there are no Fees but what the Town contributes for the Maintenance of that Court, which in their Language is cal led ihe Rounday, and thofe Contributions are very fmall ; There are Clerks fet at the Backs of the Judges, ready to write down whatever the Complainant and Defendant has to fay, and the Cafe is determined by the Prince and that Council, very equitably; for if the lead Partiality is found awarded to either Party, and the King is made acquainted with it by the Deputies at Court, the whole Sen tence is revoked, and the whole Board are corrected forit,fo that very few haveOccafi- on to appeal to Court, which they may do if they are aggrieved, and if an Appeal is made upon ill Grounds, the Appellant is chaflifed, which juft Rigour hinders many tedious Suits that arife where there are no Penalties annext to fuch Faults. The Judges have a particular Garb of their own. Their Hair being permitted to grow long, is tied on the Top of their Heads with Cotton Ribbon wrapt about it, and it V o l . 11.

About their Loyns they have a large or Scarf, as all other Teguers have, that reaches to their Ancles, and againlt the Navel a round Bundle made of their Lnngee^ as big as a Child s Head, but Stockings and Shoes are not ufed in Tegu. The Barmaes Wear the fame Habit, and imprint feveral Devices in their Skins, prickt with a Bodkin, and Powder of Charcoal rub bed over the little Wounds, while the Blood continues wet in them, and the black Marks Remain ever after. The 'Peguers dare not paint their Skins, fo that the Natives of each Nation are eafily known by the diftingui- fhing Mark of Painting or Plainnefs. There are few of their Men fat, but plump, well map'd,of an Olive Colour, and well featur'd. The Women are much whiter than the Men, and have generally pretty plump Faces, but ot fmall Stature, yet very well lhapU their Hands and Feet fmall, and their Aim' and Legs Well proportioned. Their Head- irefs is their own black Hair tied up behind, and when they go abroad, they wear zShml folded up, or a Piece of white Cotton Cloth Iving loofe on the Top of their Heads, i neir bodily Garb is a Frock of Cotton Cloth or Silk, made meet for their Bodies, and the vims of their frock flretcht clofe on the .um, the lower Part of the Frock reaching -ill 1-thigh down.

CHAP. XXXVII. Gives an Account of the Pegu Clergy their Charity, &amp;c. their Temples^ and the Rea- fon why they are fo numerous, and their Trials by Ordeal, the Fertility of the Coun try, and the Ceremony inhuming the Corps of an high 'Priejt. ' | n H E Tegu Clergy are the befl: Obfer- vers of the Rules of Morality and Cha rity, that I have met within my Travels,and the People are pious and hofpitable. There are vaft Numbers of Temples built in this Country, but mofl of Wood, becaufe that Material is plentifullefl and cheapeft, and takes Varnifh and Gilding beft, being gawdi- ly painted both within and without. Every one has free Liberty to build a Baw or Temple, and when it is finifhed, purchafes or beflows a few Acres of Ground to main tain a certain Number of Priefls and Novices, D 3 who54- A new Account who manure and cultivate the Ground for their own Suftenance, and in the Garden the Priefb and Novices have a Convent built for their Conveniency of Lodgings and Stu dy, and thofe are their fettled Benefices, for they are no Charge to the Laity, but by their induftrious Labour in managing their Garden, they have enough for themfelves, and fomething tofpare to the poor Indigent of the Laity ; but if their Garden is too fmall or fteril for the Subllftence of their Family, then they fend fome Novices abroad with a large Orange-coloured Mantle about their Bodies, with a Basket hanging on their left Arm, a little Drum in the left Hand, and a little Stick in the right, and when they come to the People's Doors they beat three Strokes with the Stick on the Drum, and if none come to anfwer, they beat again, and fo on to the third Time, and then if none anfwer, they proceed to the next Houfe without fpeaking a Word, but they are fel- dom fent away without an Alms of Rice, Pulle, truits, or Roots, which is their only Pood, and what they receive more than they have prefent Occafion for, they diftribute to the Poor, for they never take Care for to Morrow, living all their Days in Celebacy, they have none of the Anxiety of thinking about Prpvifion for a Widow and Children. Their innocent exemplary Lives procure them many P ree-will-offerings from the well dif- pofed Laity, and what is faved after provid ing their Convents, of Eatables and Clothing, rc-of the Eaft Indies. 55 returns to the Maintenance of the diftreft Laity, who, through Age, Sicknefs, or other Accidents, cannot maintain themfelves by Labour, but none who are able to work, par take of their Charity. • They preach or le^lure frequently, and have a numerous Auditory. Their Religion is Taganiftn, and their Syllem of Divinity 'Polytheijm. They have Images in all their Temples or Baws, of inferior Gods, fuch as Somma Otddom, Samfay, and Trawfoutyh^i they cannot form an Id ea of the Image of the great God, whofe Adoration is left to their Tatlafoies or Priefls. Those Taflapoies or Priefts, teach, that Charity is the mod fublime Virtue, and there fore ought to be extenfive enough to reach not only to human Species, but even to Ani mals, wherefore they neither kill nor eat any, and they are fo benevolent to Mankind, that they cherifli all alike without Diftind^ion, for the fake of Religion. They hold all Reli gions to be good that teach Men to be good, and that the Deities are pleafed with Variety of Worfhip, but with none that is hurtful to Men, becaufe Cruelty muflbedifagreeableto the Nature of a Deity : So being all agreed in that Fundamental, they have but few Tole- micksy and no Perfecutions, for they fay that our Minds are free Agents, and ought neither to be fore'd norfetter'd. The Images in their Temples are placed in Domes, in a fitting Pofture, with their Legs acrofs, their Toes all alike long, their • D 4 Arms5^ A new Account Arms and Hands very fmall in Proportion to their Bodies, their taces longer than human, and their Ears large, and the Lappets very thick. The Congyegation bows to them when they come in and go out, and thatisall the Oblation they receive. 1 he y never repair an old Baw, nor is thei e any Occafion for that Piety or Expence; tor in every September there is an old Cu- '™m for Gentlemen of Fortune, to make oky Rockets, and fet them a flying in the Air, and if any fly any great Height, that is a certain Sign that the Owner is in favour with the Gods, but if it comes to the Ground, and fpends its Fire without rifing, the Owner is much dejeded, and believes that the Gods are angry with him, but the happy Man, whofe him in the Gods Favour, never Tails of bmlding a new Baw* and dedicates n 1 to r , 1 f; he adores, and fome Priefls, w hole Fern pies are gone to Decay, bring their mages to adorn it, who have the Benefice for their Pains. I have 1'een fome of thofe Rockets folarge, tint one of them could contain above five hundVed Weight of Powder Duft and Coal, which is their common Compofition. The Carcafe is the Trunk of a great Tree made hol low, leaving about two Inches of folid Wood without (he Cylinder, to ftrengthen it, the Hollow they fill with the Compofition well iamm d in, and after that is done, they make ongsol green Buffaloes Hides, and hale tigot round the Carcafe to keep it fromfplit- ting.of the Eaft Indies. 57 ting, and thofe Thongs are put from one End to the other, in the Place of Hoops, and when they grow dry, they are as clofe on the Carcafe as fo many Hoops. Then they fecure the Ends, that the Compofition may come gradually out, when fired. The Carcafe they place on a Branch of a large hjgh Tree, which grows plentifully in their fields, and fix it in the Pofition they would have it mount in when fired, and then they take a large Bambow for a Tail to balance it. Some I have feen above 120 Foot long. When the Fail is made fajft according to Art, then the Day of Solemnity is proclaimed, and great Numbers of People of all Ranks, Degrees and Ages, aflemble to fee the Rocket flv. h hen all are convened, the Lafliings that laltned it to the Tree, are cut, except fo many as can fupport it from falling, and there are Men with Hatchets ready to cut them, when the Fire is put to it, which is done by the Owner, and then the R6ckec takes Flight, and fome fly a prodigious Height, others come to the Ground, and fly 5 or 600 Paces in an irregular Motion, wounding or fcorching all that come in its Way. The Confequences of the high Flier and the low, I have defcribed at Length above. A little \\ hile after the Rockets flying they have another Feaft, called the Cottock, and lome Women are chofen out of the People allembled, to dance a Dance to the Gods of the Earth. Hermophradites, who are nu merous in this Country, are generally chofen, if58 A new Account if there are enow prefent to make a Set for the Dance, I faw nine dance like mad Folks, for above half an Hour, and then fome of them fell in Fits, foming at the Mouth for the Space of half an Hour; and, when their Senfes are reftored, they pretend to foretel Plenty or Scarcity of Corn for that Year, if the Year will prove fickly or falutary to the People, and feveral other Things of Moment, and all by that half Hour's Converfation that the furious Dancer had with the Gods while fhe was in a Trance. They have various Sorts ofMufick, but the Pipe and Tabor are elleemed, the beft, tho their llringed Inllruments pleafed my Ears beft. They have one Sort in Shape of a Galley, with about twenty Bells of feveral Sizes and Sounds, placed on the upper Part, as it lies along. The Inftrument is a- bout three Foot long, and eight or ten Inches broad, and fix Inches deep. They beat thofcBells with a Stick made of heavy Wood, and they make no bad Mufick. There are two large Temples near r'taity fo like one another in Stru^ure, that they feem to be built by one Model. One flands about fix Miles to the Southward, cal led Kiakiack, or, the Gc// of Gods Temple. In it is an Image of twenty Yards long, lying in a fleeping Pofture, and, by their Tradition, lias lien in that Poflure 6000 Years. His Doors and Windows are always open, and every one has the Liberty to fee him ; and, when he awakes, this World is to be annihi lated.of the Eaft Indies. 5^ Jated. The Temple {lands on an highcham- pain Ground, and may eafily be feen, in a clear Day, eight Leagues off. The other Hands in a low Plain, North of Syrian, a- bout the fame Dfltance, called Ttagun. His Doors and Windows are always Ihut, and none enters his Temple but his Priefts, and they won't tell what Shape he is of, only he is not of human Shape. Aflbon as Kiakiack dillblves the Being and Frame of the World, T&gt;agon or c Bagun will gather up the Frag ments, and make a new one. There are yearly l^airs held near thofe Temples, and the Free will Offerings arifing at thofe Fairs, are for the Ufe of the Temples. For finding out fecretMurder, Theft or Perjury, the Trial of Ordeal is much in Cu- llom in Tegu, One Way is to make the Ac* cufer and the Accufed take fome raw Rice in their Mouths, and chew, and fwallow it, but he that is guilty of the Crime alledged, or ot falfe Acculation, cannot fwallow his Morfel, but the innocent chews and fwal- lows his eafily. Another W ay they have by driving a Stake of W ood into a River, and making the Accufer and Accufed take hold of the Stake, and keep their Heads and Bodies underWater, and he who flays longed under Water, is the Perfon to be credited, and whofoever is con- yieted by this Trial, either for the Crime ah iedged, or for malicious Slander, by Accu- lanon, mull ly on his Back three Days and JNights, with his Neck in a Pair of Stocks, without60 A new Account without Meat or Drink, and fined to boot. They have alfo the Cuftom of dipping the naked Hand in boyling Oy], or liquid Lead, to clear them from atrocious Crimes, if ac- cufed, and if the Accufer fcalds himfelf in the Trial, he muft undergo the Punifliment due to the Crime, which makes People very cautious how they calumniate one another: And, if any one afperfe a Woman with the Name of W hore, and cannot prove the A- fper/ion to be true, they are fined feverely. The Country is fruitful and healthful, and the Air fo good, that when Strangers come hither in a bad State of Health, they feldom fail of a fpeedy Recovery ; but the fmall Pox is dreaded as peftiferous, and in the Province of Kirian that Diitemper is moll dangerous and mofl infectious, fo that if any one is feiz- ed by that Difeafe, all the Neighbourhood removes to two or three Miles DHlance, and builds new Houfes, which are eafily done with Bambows and Reeds, which they have in great Plenty. They leave with the difeaf- ed Perfon a Jar of Water, a Basket of raw Rice, and fome earthen Pots to boyl it in, then they bid him farevvel for twenty one Days. If the Patient has Strength enough to rife and boyl Rice, he may then recover, if not, he muft even die alone. And it is obfervable, that, while a Perfon has that Diitemper, the Tiger, for all his Voraciouf- nefs, will not touch him. If the Patient dies within the Term of twenty one Days, then the Smell certifies them on their ap proach-of the Eaft Indies. preaching the Houfe, and if he live, they carry him to their new built City, and make him a free Burgefs. I favv the Ceremony of an high Priefls Funeral, and was not a little pleafed with the Solemnity. After the Corps had been kept three or four Months by Spirits or Gums from Putrefadion, there was a great Maft fixt in the Ground, fo faft, that it could be moved no Way from its perpendicular Pofi- tion. 1 hen, about fifty or fixty Yards on each Side of that Maft, four fmaller Mafts were placed, and fixed perpendicularly in the Ground. Around the great Mail, in the Middle, were ereded three Scaffolds above one another, the lowermoft bigger than the fecond, and the third fmaller than that, fo that it lookt like a Pyramid four Stories high. The Scaffolds were railed in on each Sidej except an open Place of three or four Foot wide on each Side. All the Scaffolds, and the Ground below them, were filled with Combuftibles. From the Mali in the Middle four Ropes were carried to the other four Mails, and hal d tight, and a Fire-rocket on each Rope was placed at the refpedive Imall Mails. Then the Corps was carried to the upper Story of the Pyramid, and laid tlat on the Scaffold, and, after a great Shew of Soirow among the People there prefent, a Trumpet was founded, which was a Sio-- nal to fet Fire to the Rockets, which, in an Inltant, flew with a quick Motion along the Ropes, and fet Fire to the Combuftibles, and6i A new and in a Moment they were all in a Flamej fo that in an Hour or two all was confumed. This high Prielt was held in fo great Ve neration, that he was reckoned a Saint a- mong the People. He was in great Efteem with the King, and when any Nobleman fell into Difgrace, he ufed his Intereft with the King to have him reftored again to Favour, unlefs they were guilty of atrocious Crimes, and, in that Cafe, he ufed his Endeavours to have the Rigour of the Punifliment extenu ated. All the tegu Clergy are Mediators in making up Cafes of Debate and Contenti on that happen among Neighbours. They never leave mediating till there be a Recon ciliation, and, in Token of Friendlhip, ac cording to an ancient Cufbm there, they eat ChamPock from one another's Hand, and that feals the Friendlhip. This Champock is Tea of a very unfavoury Tafte, it grows, as other Tea does, on Bullies, and is in Ufe on fuch Occafions all over Tegu, A n d now, fince I muft leave Tegu, I mufl not omit giving the Clergy their due Praifes in another particular Praftice of their Chari ty. If a Stranger has the Misfortune to be lliip-wrack'd on their Coatf, by the Laws of the Country, the Men are the King's Slaves, but, by the Mediation of the Church, the Governors overlook that Law; and when the unfortunate Strangers come to their Baws, they find a great Deal of Hofpitality, both in Food and Raiment, and have Let tersof the Eaft Indies. ters of Recominendation from the Priefls of one Convent to thofe of another on the Road they defign to travel, where they may expeft VefTels to tranfport them to Syrian * and if any be Tick or maim'd, the Priefts^ who are the Teeners chief Phyficians, keep them in their Convent, till they are cured, and then furnifh them with Letters, as is a- bove obferved, for they never enquire which Way a Stranger worfhips God, but if he is human, he is the Objed of their Cha rity. There are fome Chriftimis in Syrian of the Tortugueze Offspring, aud fome Arme nians.

The Iflands oppofite to theCoafl of Ta~ nacerin, are the Andemans. They ly about 80 Leagues off, and are furrounded with ma ny dangerous Banks and Rocks; they are all inhabited with Canihals, who are fo fearlefs, that they will fvvim off to a Boat if fhe ap proach near the Shore, and attack her with their wqoden Weapons, notwithlbnding the Superiority of Numbers in the Boat, and the Advantage of mi (live and defenfive Arms of Iron, Steel and Fire. I knew one FerguJJbn, who commanded a Ship from Fort St. George, bound from Ma lacca to Bengal^ in Company with another Ship, going too near one of the Andeman I- flands, was driven, by the Force of a ftrong Current, on fome Rocks, and the Ship was loll. The other Ship was driven thro' a Chanel between two of the lame Iflands, and was not able to aflilt the Ihip-wrack'd Men, but neither Fergujfon nor any of his People were ever more heard of, which gave Ground to conjedure that they were all devoured by thofe lavage Canihals. J faw one of the Natives of thofe Iflands at Atcheen in Anno 1694. He was then about 40 Years of Age. The Andemaners had a yearly Cuftom to come to the Nicobar I- ilands,of the Eafl: Indies. 6 ] flands, with a great Number of tmzWPraivsi and kill or take Prifoners as many of the poor Nicohareans as they could overcome. The Nkobareans again jovned their Forces, and gave the Canibals Battle, when they met with them, and one Time defeated them, and gave no Quarter to the Andemaners, This Man above mentioned, when a Boy of loor \ears of Age, accompanied his Father in the Wats, and was taken Prifoner, and his Vouth recommending him to Mercy, they laved his Life, and made him a Slave. Af ter he had continued fo three or four Years, lie was carried to Atcheen to be fold for Cloth, Knives and Tobacco, which are the Commodities mod wanting on the Nicobars, The Atcheeners being Mahometans, this Boy's Patron bred him up in that Religion, and iome \ ears after his Mafler dying, gave him his Freeedom; he having a great Defire to fee his native Country, took a 'Fraiv, and the Months of December, January and Fe bruary being fair Weather,and the Sea fmooth, he ventured to the Sea, in order to go to his own Country, from the Iflands of Gomn? and 'Vullo-wey, which ly near Atcheen. Here the Southermoft of the Nicobars may be feen, and lo one Ifland may be feen from another, from the Southermoft of thofe to Cfntty-an- dcman, which is the Southermofl of the An- demans , which are diilant from Atcheen a- bout an hundred Leagues. Arriving among his Relations he was made welcome, with great Demonftralions of Joy to fee him alive, E i whom68 A new whom they expeded to have been long dead. Having retained his native Language, he gave them an Account of his Adventures; and, as the Andemaners have no Notions of a Deity, he acquainted them with the Know ledge he had of a God, and would have per- fwaded his Country-men to learn of him the Way to adore God, and to obey his-Laws, bur he could make no Converts. When he had ftay'd a Month or two, he took leave to begone again, Which they permitted, on Con dition that he would return. He brought along with him four or five hundredweight of Quick-filver, and he faid, that fome of the Andeman Illands abound in that Commodity. He had made feveral Trips thither before I faw him, and always brought fome Quick-filver along with him. Some Mahometan Fakires would fain have accompanied him in his Voy ages, but he would never fufFer them, be- caufe he faid, he could not engage for their Safety among his Country-men. When I faw him, he w T as in Company with a Se'id, whom I carried a Palfenger to Surat* and from him I had this Account of his Adventures. T he next Place of any Commerce on this Coaft, is the Hland of 'fonkceyloan^ it lies in the Dominions of the King oi Siam. Between Merjee and Joukceyloan there are feveral good Harbours for Shipping, but the Sea-coail is very thin of Inhabitants, becaufe there are great Numbers of Freebooters, called Sallei- fers, who inhabit Illands along the Sea-coaft, and they both rob, and take People for Slaves,of the Eatt Indies. 6$ and tranfport them for Atcheen, and there make Sale of them, and Jonkceyloan often feels the Weight of their Depredations. The North End of Jonkceyloan lies within a Mile of the Continent, but the South End is above three Leagues from it. Between the Ifland and the Continent is a good Har bour for Shipping in the South-weft Mon- foons, and on the Weft Sideofthelftand^V- ton Bay is a fafe Harbour in the North-eaft Winds. The Illands afford good Mafts for Shipping, and abundance of Tin, but few People to dig for it, by reafon of the afore mentioned Outlaws, and the Governors be ing generally Chinefe, who buy their Places at the Court of Siam, and, to reimburfe them- felves, opprefs the People, in fo much that Riches would be but a Plague to them, and their Poverty makes them live an eafie indo lent Life. Yet the Villages on the Continent drive a fmall Trade with Shipping that come from the Chormondel Coaft, and Benval, but both the Buyer and Seller trade by Retail, fo that a Ship's Cargo is a long Time in felling, and the Produ6l of the Country is as long in purchafing. The Iflands off this Part of the Coaft are the Nicoharsy and are about 90 Leagues di- llant from the Continent. The Northmoft Cluftcr is low, and are called the Carmen- bars, and by their Vicinity to the Andemans y are but thinly inhabited. The middle du ller is fine champain Ground, and all but one, well inhabited. They are called the So- E 3 mererayo A new Account merera Illands, becauic on the South End of the largell Illand, is an Hill that refembles the Top of an Vnibrella or Somerera. About lix Leagues to the Southward oi Scwc? ct a Ifland, lies Tallung-jdng the uninhabited Ifland, where one Captain Oweu loil; his Ship in Anno 1708. but the Men were all faved,and finding no Inhabitants, they made Fires in the Night, and next Day there came 5 or 6 Canoaes fiom and Gouvy-y two fine Illands that ly a- bout four Leagues to the Weftward of the defert lAand, and very courteoufly carried the fhipwrackt Men to their Illands of King and Goury, with what little Things they had laved of their Apparel and other Necellaiies, The Captain had faved a broken Knife a- bout four Inches long in the Blade, and he having laid it careleily by, one of the Na tives made bold to take it, but did not ollei to hide it. The Captain feeing his Knife in the poor Native's Hand, took it trom him, and bellowed fome Kicks and Blows on him for his ill Manners, which was very ill taken, for all in general Ihewed they were dillatisfied with the'Aftion; and the Ihipwrackt Men could obferve Contentions ariiing between thofe who were their Benefaftors in bringing them to their liland, and others who were not concerned in it : However, next Day as the Captain was fitting under a Tree at Din ner, there came about a Dozen of Natives to^ wards him, and faluted him on every Side with a Shower of Darts made of heavy hard Wood, with their Points hardned in the Fire,of the Eaft Indies. yr and fo he expir'd in a Moment. How far they had a Mind to purfue their Refentment, I know not, but their Benefaftors kept Guard about their Houfe till next Day, and then prefented jhem with two Canoaes, and fitted them with Out-leagers to keep them from overturning, and put fome Water in Pots, fome Cocoa-nuts and dry Filh, and pointed to them to be immediately gone, which they did. Being fixteen in Company, they divided equally, and lleered their Courfe for Jonk- ceyloariy but in the Way one of the Boats lofl her Out-leager, and drowned all her Crew, the relt arrived fafe, and I carried them after wards to Matchul'tpatam. Ning and Goury are two fine fmooth Iflands, well inhabited, and plentifully furnilhed with feveral Sorts of good Filh, Hogs and Poultry, but they have no Horfes, Cows, Sheep, nor Goats, nor wild Beails of any Sort, but Mon- kies. They have no Rice nor Pulie, fo that the Kernel of Cocoa-nuts, Tarns, and Potatoes ferves them for Bread.' Along the North End of the eaflmoft of the two Iflands,are good Soundings from ten to eight Fathoms Sand, about two Miles off the Shore. The People come thronging on board in their Canoaes, and bring Hogs, Fowl, Cocks, Filh, frelh, faked and dried Tarns, the belt I ever tailed, Potatoes, Parots and Monkies, to barter for old Hatchets, Sword-blades, and thick Pieces of Iron-hoops, to make defenfive Weapons againll their com mon Difturbers and implacabale Enemies the E 4 An-'71 new Account Jjndeminers), and Tobacco they are very gree dy of, for a Leaf of Tobacco, if pretty large, they will give a Cock, for three Foot of an Iron Hoop, a large Hog, and for one Foot in Length, a Pig.

T heIfland Somcrera lies about 8Leagues to the Northward of Ning and Goury, and is well inhabited by the Number of Villages that Ihew themfelves as we fail along its Shores. The People, like thofe of Ning and Gonry^ are very courteous, and bring the Product of their liland aboard of Ships to exchange for the aforementioned Commodities. Silver nor Gold they neither have nor care for, fo the Root of all Evil can never fend out Branches of Mifery, or bear Fruit to poifon their Happinefs. The Mens Clothing is a Bit of String round their Middle, and about a Foot and an Half of Cloth fix Inches broad, tuckt before and behind within that Line. The Women have a Petticoat from the Na vel to the Knee, and their Hair clofe lhaved, but the Men have the Hair left on the up per Part of the Head, and below the Crown, but cut fo Ihort that it hardly comes to their Ears, The Southward Clufler of the Nicobarsy is mountainous, and the People partake of its unpoliflied Nature, being more uncivil and furly than thofe to the Northward. Their Iflands produce the fame Neceffaries as the Qtbers do,of the Eaft Indies. 72 Quedah is the next Place of Note on the Continent to the Southward, and is honoured with the Title of a Kingdom, tho' both fmall and poor. The Town which bears the fame Name, (lands on the Banks of a fmall navi gable River, deep, but narrow, about 5*0 Miles from the Sea, and the King refides in it, but fliews no Marks of Grandeur, befides arbitra ry governing. Their Religion is Mahometan, much mixt vj\i\\ e PaganiJm. The People are deceitful, covetous, and cruel. It was many Years tri butary to Siam, but in their long c PegtL War, it threw off the Yoke. Its Produft is Tin, Pepper, Elephants, and Elephants Teeth, Canes, and itamar, a Gum that is ufed for making Pitch and Tar for the Ufe of Shipping. The King is poor, proud, and beggarly, he never fails of villting Granger Merchants at their coming to his Port, and then, according to Cultom, he mult have aPrefent. When the Stranger returns the Vifit, or has any Bufi- nefs with him, he mull make him aPrefent, otherwife he thinks due Rcfpeft is not paid to him, and in Return of thefe Prcfents his Ma- jefty will honour the Stranger with a Seat near his facred Pcrfon, and will chew a little Betel, and put it out of his royal Mouth on 'a little gold Saucer, and fends it by his Page to the Stranger, who mufl take it with all the Sigfls of Humility and Satisfaction, and chew it after him, and it is very dangerous to refufe the royal Morfel. SomeA new Account Some Ages ago, Ligore was a Kingdom of it felf, and the Kings of ^uedah and Llgore fell at Variance. He of Quedah invaded the Territories of Ligore^ and left his Queen and his Son, an hopeful Youth about twenty Years of Age, to govern in his Abfence. The Mo- ther and Son grew enamour'd of each other, and flie found her felf with Child by the re ciprocal Efteem they bore one another. She being juftly afraid of the King's Refentment on his Return, laid the Danger before her Son, that threatned them both, and advifed the dutiful Child to prevent their Death by killing his Father. Whereupon he wrote to the King for Leave to give him a Vifit in the Camp, which Favour he obtained, and pro ceeded accordingly to the Place where his Father was with his Army. At his Arrival he was received by all with great Demonilra- tions of Joy, particularly by his Father, who made him lodge in his own Tent. The Vil lain let his Father fall afleep, and then tab bed him to the Heart, and immediately left the Army, and haded to his loving Mo ther, to give her an Account of his noble Adion. In the Morning the King being found dead, and the Son gone, the' Regicide was foon known ; and becaule the Queen fhould not continue long a Widow, the obedient Child married her himfelf, becaufe none in the Country had royal Blood in their Veins but himfelf, and flie could not (loop to match below the Dignity of a fovereign Prince. Such libidinous Marriages are very frequent in this Country to this prefent Time. Terahof the Eaft Indies. 75 Terah is the next Country to Quedah.

There arefeveral other Places along that Coaft of Malaya, that produce great Quan tities of Tin, but Salangore and Tarfalore are the molt noted, tho' little frequented by Europeans, becaufe they have too many of the Terah Qualities, to be trufled with ho ned Mens Lives and Money. Their Reli gion is alfo a Sort of fcoundrel Mahome- tifin. Chap,A new Account CHAP. XXXIX.

Fhere is a noble fpacious River that accom modates fohore-lami. A s s o o n as the King of Johore was gone, P or tug 1 * 6 z* 6 began to fortifie,andencom- pafled a little Hill with a Stone Wall, about a Mile round, in which they built a City, and called it Malacca, and by the Convenicncy of its Situation, in a few ^Tears it became the greateft Mart in India ; however, the King of fohore was fain to make a Peace with the T'ortugtieze, allowing them their Fort, and asof the Eaft Indies. *77 as much Ground round it as their Cannon could fling a Shot, and fo they became Friends; but the King of Johore invaded the King of Aaroisus Dominions, with a numerous Fleet of Gallies, and in a fhort Time forced him to crave Aid from the Tortugueze, who ne ver us'd to deceive their Allies but when they trufted to them, and fo the King of Aarow loft his Country. Malacca, a Place of fmall Account, in a fhort Time became famous all over and Enrepe, lying almoftin the Centre of Trade, brought thither by Shipping from the rich Kingdoms of Jafon, China, For mo fa, Luco- ma, Tonquin, Couchtn-chma, Cambodia, and Slam, befides what Johore produced, and Su matra, Java, Borneo, Macajfer, Banda, Am- hoina, and Ternate Iflands, that produce ma ny valuable Commodities.

They heard that the Tortugueze Gover nor was a fordid avaricious Fellow, and ill beloved by the Garifon, fo the 'Dntchy byfe- cret Conveyances, tampered with him by Let ters, promifing him Mountains of Gold if he would contribute towards their gaining the Fort. At length the Price was fet of 8oooc Pieces of Eight, to be the Reward of his Treachery, and to be fafely tranfported to Batavia in their Fleet, and be made a free Denizon there. So he fent fecret Orders to the 'Dutch to make an Attack on the Eaft-fide of the Fort, and he would aCl his Part, which was accordingly done.

The Matter Gunner being polled on a large Baftion, whole Walls arewafhed by the Sea at high Water, with about icq Tortu- gueze along with him, would by no Means yield till he had capitulated with the 'Dtitch for fair Quarter for himfelf and his Compa ny, which the Dutch would not adhere to, fo that for two Days he gallantly maintained his Port. At lad, by continual Fatigue, and Lofs of his Men, he was obliged to yield to Fate, and great Superiority of Numbers, and died like an Hero, with his Sword in his Hand; and there is a common Report at Malacca ftill, that the Night after the ani- verfary Day of his Death, his Genius is feen on that Baftion : And I was informed by a Dutch Governor at Malacca, that on that Night no Sentinels are fet there, for that feverals have tound the Effccls of his Fury, by being thrown8o A nm Account thrown over the Wall, and have been either killed or maimed by the Fall. The 'Portuguese, to Ihew their Zeal to Religion, while they were Matters of Ma lacca, had no lefs than three Churches and a Chapel within the Fort, and one without, but now there is but one Church and a Chapel within, and none without. That which the 'Dutch now ufe for their Worfliip, (lands con- fpicuoufly on the Top of the Hill, and may be feen up or down the Streights at a good Diftance, and a Flag-ftaff is placed on the Steeple, on which a Flag is hoifted on the Sight of any Ship. T he Fort is both large andftrong, the Sea wafhing the Walls of one third Part of it, and a deep rapid, but narrow River, the Weft- fide of it, and a broad deep Ditch the reft of it. The Governor's Houfe is both beauti ful and convenient, and there are feveral o- ther good Houfes in the Fort, and in the Town without the Fort, but the Road for Shipping is at too great a Diftahce to be de fended by the Fort, the Shallownefs of the Sea obliging them to ly above a League off, which is a very great Inconveniency. For in 1709. the French coming into the Streights wit h a Squadron of three or four Sail, feeing a large Ship in the Road, newly arrived from Japon, ftood in to the Road, and had certain ly carried her out, if the Wind had not failed them about Musket Shot from her. A t Malacca the Streights are not above 4 Leagues broad ; for tho' the oppofite Shore on^ ^ Eaft Indies. 81 on Sumatra is very low, yet it may eafily be Icon in a dear Day, which is theReafon that the bea is always as fmooth as a Mill-pond, except when it is ruffled with Squalls of Wind, which feldom come without Lightnings, .under, ari ^ Rain; and tho' they come with great Violence, yet they are loon over, not often exceeding an Hour. The Country produces nothing for a fo- icign Market, hut a little 1 in and Klephants leeth, but feveral excellent Fruits and Roots ioi the L ie ot the Inhabitants, and Strangers who call there for Refrefhments. The A/a- lacca Pine-apple is accounted the beft in the World, for in other Parts, if they are eaten ta a imall Excefs, they are apt to give Sur feits, but thole of Malacca never olfend the Stomach. The Mangoftane is a delicious rruit, almoll; in the Shape of an Apple, the Skin is thick and red, bei^g dried it is a good Aftnngent. The Kernels (if I may lb call them) aie like Cloves of Craiiick, of a very a- greeable Taite, but very cold. The Ramho- Jtan is a Fruit about the Bignefs of a Wal nut, with a rough Skin, befet with CapilJa- ments, within the Skin is a veryfavoury Pulp. The c Durean is another excellent Fruit, but offenfive to fome Peoples Nofes, for it fmells very like human Excrements, but when once tailed, the Smell vanilhes. The Skin is thick and yellow, and within is a Pulp like thick Cieam in Colour and Confiltence, but more delicious in Tafte. The Pulp or Meat is very hot and nouiifhing, and inlleadof furfeitrng. V ol . II F they8l A new Account they fortifie the Stomach, and are a great In centive to Wantonnefs. 1 hey have Cocoa- nuts in Plenty, and fome grow in Marifhes that are overflown with the Sea in Spring tides. Their Liquor and Kernel partake of the Qualities of the Ground they grow in, being exceeding Salt. I never faw any Cocoa- nuts grow in Salt (j rounds but there, and fome are fo large that the Shell will hold more than an Englijh Quart Pot. They have alio Plenty of Lemons, Oranges, Limes, Sugar- canes, and Mangoes. They have a Species of Mango, called by the 'Dutch* Stinker, which is very ofTenlive both to the Smell and 1 alte, and confequently of little Ufe. There is little Corn or Pulfe grows in this Country but what is nourifht in Gardens. Sheep and Bullocks are fcarce and dear, but Swines Flefli, Poultry, and Fiili pretty plentiful, and reafonably cheap, confidering it is a T&gt;iitch Colony, whofe excelTive Taxes make every Thing dear, and difcourage the Poor from improving, lince Poverty fecures them from farther Opprellion. Their Corn comes all from Java, Stam, or Cambodia, but the Freight makes it come out dear to what it is in other Places, whofe native Ground produces it. { will pafsby their Court ofJuftice,bccaufe it hardly deferves the Name, fince Strangers are excluded from the common Laws oi Humanity, wherein I am able to give many In- llances, but I voluntarily pafs by Particularities till another Time. T hereof the Eaft Indies. There is a very high Mountain to the North-ealtward of Malacca, that lends forth feveral Rivers, of which that of Malacca is one, and all of them have fmall Quantities of Gold Dull found in their Chanels. The in land Inhabitants called Monacaboes, are a bar barous favage People,' whofe greatell Pleafure is in doing Mifchief to their Neighbours, which is the greatell Reafon why the Peafants about Malacca fow no Grain but what is in- clofed in Gardens with thick let prickly Hed ges, or deep Ditches ; for when their Grain is ripe in the open Plains, the Monacaboesnc- ver fail of putting Fire to it, in order to con- fume it. They are much whiter than their neighbouring Malayas who inhabit the low Grounds, and the Kings of Johore, whofe Sub- jeds they are, or at leaft ought to be, could never civilize them. T heir Religion is a Complex of Maho met tfm and 'Fagani/m, and they have the Cha mber of great Sorcerers, who by their Spells can tame wild Tigers, and make them carry them whither they order them, on their Backs. Once they had a Mind to try their Art on the Town of Malacca, but were unfuccefs- ful in their Entcrprize, according to common Report there. For one of their chief Wiz ards allured them that neither Gun, Sword, nor Lance fhould have Power to hurt them, it they Ihould attempt the Town, whofe De- fence conlllls only in a flight Gate, with a little round Baftion, with five or fix great Cruns mounted on it, Soon the Opinion of F x their84 ^ MW Account their Dodors Art, a great Number drew to gether, and being armed with Lance and Crofs, their common Weapons, marched without Order or Fear towards the Gate. When they came near enough, the Gunner of the Bailion pointed jfome Guns, and fet Fire to the Priming, Sut that flalhed, and the Guns would not difclwge, which dif- couraged the Guard of the Gate, but a Ma laya Soldier, who underllood fome of the Monacoboes Art, called for a Piece of Pork, with which he befmear'd the Mouths of the Cannon, while the Gunner renewed the Pri ming, and Fire being put to them, the Can non went off, and did good Execution, which fofrightned the MonaCaboes^ that they betook themlelves to Flight, and never attempted to dillurb the Town fmce. I faw lirange Cures performed by a Ma- laya Dodor at Malacca. One of them was on a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who was fecond Supercargo of a Scots Ship called the Speed-well, which was loft near Malacca. After the Ship was loft, the firft Supercargo took an Honle near the Town, by the Sea- fide, to put their Cargo and Stores in, that were faved, but eleven Chefts of Treafure and fome fine Goods were lodged in one of the ^Dutch Company's Ware-houfes in the Fort, which had three Locks on its Door. The Governor had one Key, and each of the Supercargoes one. A common Strumpet cal led Mx\s. Kennedy, who at that Time was mar ried to an Irijh Pirate of that Name, and keptof the Eall: Indies. 85 kept an Ordinary in Malacca, gave the firll Supercargo a Philtre that made him dote on her almoit to Diftradion. He was never eafie out of her Company while awake, and in his Sleep he called her by Name. When flie had got him fo far in the Noofe, fhe pre tended Ihe had great Need of Money, and would fain have borrowed a Cheit of one thoufand Pounds Sterling of the Scots Company's Money. The bewitched Super cargo could deny her nothing (lie asked for, and promiled, that if he could bring his Se cond to confent, Ihe fhould have it, but that Confent could be got on no Terms, tho' the firll proferred to be accountable to their Ma ilers for that Sum, and he acquainting her with the Impoflibility of getting that Confent, Ihe contrived a Way to remove the Second by Poifon, and going to a female Friend of hers, who was well acquainted with the My- ftery of Poifoning, procured a Dole fo fmall that flie could drop it in his Broth or Drink without his perceiving it; and accordingly flie took an Opportunity to dine with them one Day when they had Broth at Table, and in ferving the Broth about, Hie dropt it a- mong his. ^ The fame Night it began to ope rate, by Grippings and Sweating, and he be ing bred a Surgeon, took fome Medicines to correct the Grippings, which in fome Meafure the Medicine did, but he lofl his Appetite, and his Excrements came from him as black as Ink. In the Interim a Ship came from Surat, bound to China, wherein the chief S u per car- F 3 go86 A nm Account go was obliged to embarque with the Com pany's Stock, and left the Second at Malac ca, to take Care of what was left there. A few Dws after the Surat Ship failed,! arriv ed at Malaccay and found the fecond Super cargo in a deplorable Condition. H e finding all Medicines ineffeftual, began to fear Poifon, and fent for the 'Dutch Vo- clor of Phyfickto confult him, who, on Sight of his Excrements, told him plainly that he was poifoned, and advifed him to fend for a noted Malaya Doftor, who lived at a Place called Batantiga, about four Miles to the North-weft of Malacca, which he forthwith did, and when the Dodor came, he felt his Pulfe, and immediately told that he was poi foned, and that if he could not tell what Poi fon he had taken, his Cure was very defpe- rate and uncertain. I advifed my Friend to let old Beelzebub (for he was a Man, or wal king Shadow, of a difmal Afpe^l, near an hundred Years old) take him into his Care. My Friend took my Advice, and complimen ted the Doftor with five J of on Cupangs, or fifty Dollars' Old Efculaf 'tus laught when he received the Prefent, but could not /hew one Tooth, but promifed his utmoft En deavours to cure him. He asked my Friend if he fufpected any Body particularly, who might ow him a Grudge. He anfwered, none but Mris. Kennedy, or fome of her Com panions. The Dodor called for a Tea Cup, and fome frefli Limes, which were brought to him, He turned ail out of the Room but myof the Eaft Indies. S7 my felf and his Patient, and cut fome Limes &gt; and fqueezed their Juice into the Tea-cup till it was full. He then mutter'd fome un intelligible Words, keeping his right Hand moving over the Cup for the Space of three or four Minutes, and finding his Conjuration was not fatisfadory, he fhak'd his old Head, and lookt dejefted. He then mutter'd fome other Words with an higher Voice, keeping his Hand in Motion as before, and in two Minutes the Juice in the Cup feemed to boil as if Fire had been under it. Then he began to fmile. I had theCuriofity to put my Fin ger into the Juice, but it retained its ordi nary Coldnefs. He then told his Patient that his Cure was certain, on which he had a Pro- mife of five Cupangs more when the Cure was effefted. He ordered the Patient to fend a Servant toMris. Kennedys Door, and watch between the Hours of Ten and Twelve, and to obferve well if there was any unufual Noife in her Houfe between thofe Hours, and fo took his Leave with a contented Counte nance. At Ten my Friend fent a Servant ac cording to Diredion, and he and I fat dif- courfing about what we had obferved in the Dodors Anions towardseffefting the Cure. About Eleven the Spy came and 'told us that Mris. Kennedy had run Hark mad, making an hideous Noife, and faid. She had feen the Devil in the little Houfe in the Garden, in a monftrous Shape and terrible Afpefr She foon after grew furioufly mad,fcratchingand biting every Body flie could come af,' and F 4 fo66 A new Account fo the Family was forced to throw her on a Bed, and tie her down to it. In that Fit ihecontinued till about eight in the Morning, that the old Conjurer came to Town, who, upon the Advice given him, went diredly to vifit her. Upon Sight of him fhe became calm and fenfible. He ordered every Body out of the Room, and askt her what Poifon Hie had given to his Patient. She was very loth to tell, and proferred him 5 *00 Dollars to forfake his Patient, and let the Poifon operate; but he honeflly refufed, and afTured her that the fame Devil that fhe faw in the Garden, fliould be her continual Com panion all her Days, and would often make her feel the Effe6te of his Power, if Ihe did not inflantly declare what the Poifon was, and from whom fhe had it. She feeing no other Remedy, confeit where Hie had the Poifon, but could not tell what it was. The Dodorfent for theoldSchoolmiflrifs ofWic- kednefs, and when fhe came, he threatned to torment her alfo, by his humble Servant the Devil, if fhe did not forthwith declare what Poifon had been given, which fhe did, and he took away Mris. Kennedy's Compani on the Devil, and the Patient was well enough in eight or ten Days, to follow his Affairs, but Mris. Kennedy lookt ever after diiturb'd, as if continually frightned. Another flrange Cure I faw him per form on an Officer belonging to my Ship. He was going to fleep about Midnight, and lying down on bis Bed, was bit in the Calf pfof the Eaft Indies. go of the Leg by a Centifee, an Infeft withma- ny r eet, and very venomous. The Pain that the Jiue caufed would allow him no Reft. Next Day he expected that the Venom miffht have heen exhaulled, but in that he was mi- ftaken, for it grew firft red by Inflamation, and then blue and nummed. I fent for the Doctor aforelaid, who came on the firftSum- mons. I told him of the Accident that had happened, and he faid there was no Dan sen He law the inflamed Leg, and kept his Hand moving over it, but did not touch it He muttered feme unintelligible Words, and fpit on the Place affected, and in five Minutes he could walk without Pain, tho' before the Cure, he could not ftand without fomethine to lupport him. A Nl i fi' 06 , 1 haye been mentioning the cots Eaft-mdm Ship and her Supercargoes, I will give a fmall Account of the Manage ment of their Affairs in India. They arrived at Batavta about the Beginning of July 1701 but being taken up with the Pleafures of the rlace, loured away near a Month of their lime, which had been much better fpent in piolecuting their \ oyage to China: Howe- ver, by the Beginning of September, thev icacht the Coal! of China, where meetins; with a Tujfoon, or a North-eaft Storm, that often blows violently about that Seafon, they were forced to bear away for where they itaid about two Months, and then came to Malacca, where they had a Mind to clean theirtimmmmv ^ 1 90 A new Account their Ship's Bottom, and to proceed next^f- pr 'tl or May for China, The 'Dutch received them civilly, and gave them Leave to lay their Ship afliore on an Ifland to the Weft ward of the Town, a- bout two or three Miles from the Fort, and allowed them to land their Cargo and Stores on the Ifland, till their Ship was made clean, which they had perfeded in two Springs, and bringing the Ship towards the Road a- gain, the Captain being on board, ordered 10 fteer the Ship on fome Rocks that lay on the Shore, and were dry at Low-water. The third Mate, who was the only com manding Officer on board, except the Cap tain, told him of the Danger he was running into, and begged him to alter his Courfe, but the Captain curfed him for his imperti nent Advice, and run the Ship on the Rocks, but the People got a fmall Anchor and an HaMer out, and brought her aflote again, but, alToon as the Anchor was weighed, they run her once more on the Rocks, and Ihe ha ving a little Motion, a Rock w T ork'd itfelf through her Bottom, and there flie was loll: without Hopes or Defign of being recover ed, and with her ended the Scots Eafl-ind'ta Company's Intereft in Jnd'ta, Whether the Ship was loft by Ignorance or Defign, I will not judge, but, in my Opinion, it was by Defign, for, as I heard afterwards, the Cap tain and Supercargoes had taken up round Sums on the Bottom of the Ship, and took th^t Method to pay their Debts. I came to Ma-of the Eaft Indies. Malacca about the Beginning of Augufi, and found the iecond Supercargo in the ill State I have already mentioned, with the Purfer and the Supercargo's Writer, and eleven Men more, who could not get Pallages to Coun tries where they might get Employment. I had then a great Ship and a fmall one under my Command, fo I entred them all on board my Ships in the fame Pofts they had on board the Speedwel, and I entred on a Scheme with the fecond Supercargo to carry the Scots Company's Effefts on board my great Ship to Scotland y but the firft Supercargo, who was, before my Arrival, gone to China, and had no Mind ever to fee his native Country again, broke our Meafures by rambling thro' India with his Mailers Stock. What the Scots Company's Cargo was, I did not fee; but the Supercargoes had a Chell of Glafs- ware in their own private Adventure, the moll obfeenely lhameful that ever I faw or heard of among Merchants. They were^Pri- apufes of a large Size, with a Scrotum bie e- nough to hold an Englijh Pint of Liquor, ei ther to addrefs the God Bacchus, or the Goddefs Venus, as feemed bed to their Vo taries. I profccuted my Voyage to Surat, and left the Scots Supercargoes to purfue their Maflers Intereft in getting their Affairs in a Readinefs to get a Cargo for Europe, to be carried on board my Ship according to an Agi ccmcnt made between the fecond Super cargo and me; but, inftead of putting Af fairs92. A new Account fairs in a Readinefs, he embaralTed them, lent fome of his Maflers Stock to fome infolvent Merchants in Atnoy in China, and let out fome on the Bottom of the Ship he took his Paflage on board of, and tho' that Ship was ordered, by the Owners and Freighters, back to Surat diredly, a young Gentleman a bupercargo went with her to Bengal, and from thence to Terfia^ where the Ship was leized by the Owners Orders, and fent to Surat, where I met with the firft Supercargo half-dead with Vexation for his Folly, in keeping fuch a Stock two Years and an half without the leaft Improvement: And what was left in China, was in Danger of ever be ing recovered, tho' it was afterwards. At Stirat the chief Supercargo grew very weak, and finding he had not long to (lay in this World, had a Mind to fettle his Affairs here, before he went to the other, fo one Day he fent for me, to advife him what he ihould do with his Matters Effeds, if he mould die. I asked him if his Accounts were bi ought forward, and he told me they were, ^efired, that I would take all into my 1 ollellion, and be accountable to the Scots Company, and to remit it Home to them, according to the Orders they would fend me about it, but I excufed myfelf, and would not meddle in their Affairs on fuch weak V r^- n Ut ? a ^ v ^ e( l him to lodge his Books and Ffteci's in the Hands of one Mr. I?er- nard rVeych€ r whom I took to be an honed andof the Eaft Indies. ipj and induflrious Gentleman, and fo he did, and then he died. H e was a Gentleman of a very courteous Behaviour, and underltood a fmall Sword excellently well, but not much verfed in Merchandize or foreign Commerce. The fecond was a very good Surgeon, and was Mafter of the French Language, but under- flood nothing in Accounts. The Captain, who ftaid on board of my Ship above twelve Months, had been bred in his Youth a Driver of Cattle from the Highlands of Scotland in to England, He had very mean Education, and could not tell what he meant either in fpeaking or writing. He had a brutal Cou rage, and was the Husband of three Wives all alive together. He knew nothing either of the Theory or praftical Parts of Navigation, and yet had been honoured with a Commif- fion for Lieutenant in the royal Navy of Eng* land. I muft now leave my long Digreffion, and proceed from Malacca along the Coalt of Malay ay tho' there are no Places of Com merce between it and Johore Lami, which is fometimes the Place of that King's Refi- dence, and has the Benefit of a fine deep large River, which admits of two Entrances into it. The fmalleft is from the Weft ward, called by Europeans the Streights of Sinca- pure, but by the Natives Salleta de Brew. It runs along the Side of Sincafure Illand for $ or 6 Leagues together, and ends at the greai River of Johore. ChapA nm A CHAP. XL.

The Inhabitants are lazy, indolent, perfi dious and cruel. The Country is very woody, being daily refrefht with Showers and Bree zes of Wind.

They are great Lovers of Praying and Preaching, and frequent their Mofques very often, and look very devout; but their Pradices are the mod irreligious and immo ral of any People I know. In Anno 1695-. their King was a Youth.of twenty Years of Age, and being vitioully in« clined, was fo corrupted by Adulation and flagitious Company, that he became intole rable. I went to Johore Lami at that Time, to traffick with his Subjeds, and fome China Men, with a Cargo proper for their Turn, and, according to Cuitom, went to compli ment his Majefty with a Prefent, in which was a Pair of fcrew-barrelled Piftols. He defired me to prove them with a Shot, to try how far it would penetrate a Pod that was at the Gate, which I did, and he much admired how fo little Powder Ihould have Strength to force a Ball fo far in the Wood, and begged fome Powder and Ball, which f gave him, and the next Time he w T ent a- broad, he tried, on a poor Fellow on the Street, how far they could carry a Ball into his Flefli, and fhot him through the Shoulder. H e was a great Sodomite-, and had taken many of his Orankays or Nobles Sons, by Force into his Palace for that abominable Service. A Moorijh Merchant, wiio was a Freighter on board my Ship, had an hand- fom Boy to his Son, whom the King onetiir^aWte - HTllMllllfll Pii 9&lt;5 A new Account Day faw, and would needs have him for a Catamite. He threatned the Father, that if he did not fend him with good Will, he would have him by Force. The poor Man had taken an Houfe clofe by our Ship, and immediately came with his Son on board, imploring my Protedion, which I promifed him. He had not been half an Hour on board, till a Guard came in a Boat to demand him. I would fuffer none to enter but the Officer, and an Interpreter for the Tortuqueze Lan guage. The Officer told me his Errand, and, in an huffing Manner, threatned me, iflpro- tefted him. I made him no Anfwer, but taught him to leap into the River, and bid the Interpreter tell the King, that, if he offe red the lead Violence to any that belonged to me, I would fire down his Palace about his E -ars. He had never been contradifted before, much lefs threatned, and he fent for his Orankays to know if I was a King or no. They told him that I was on board of my Ship, and that I would prove a dangerous E- nemy, if provoked, and begg'd, that hisMa- jefty would remove to a Village about twen ty Miles up the River, and ftay till our Ship was gone, which Favour he willingly grant ed us, and io we traded with fome more Se curity, but were continually in Arms for fear of a Surprize. H e continued his infupportable Tyranny and Brutality for a Year or two after 1 was gone, and his Mother, to try if he could be broke oil that unnatural Cultom of Gonverfe withof the Eaft Indies. y-j with Males, perfwaded a beautiful young Woman to vifit him, when he was a Bed, which Ihe did, and allured him with her Em braces, but he was fo far from being pleafed with her Converlation, that he called his black Guard, and made them break both her Arms, for offering to embrace his royal Perfon. She cried, and laid it was by his Mother's Order Ihe came, but that was no Excufe. Next Morning he fent a Guard to bring her Father's Head, but he being an Orankay did not care to part with it, lb the Tyrant took a Lance in his Hand, and fvvare he w T ouId have it; but, as he w T as entring at the Door, the Orankay pad a long Lance through his Heart, and fo made an End of the Beaft. The Kingdom was three Years without a King, but inteftine Difcords daily arifing, in Anno 1700, they choofed another, a Coufin- german to him that was killed. His Name was Sultan Abdulla G 'talil, a Prince of great Moderation and Juftice, and governed w T elI for eight or nine Years, that he held the Reins of Government in his own Hands Trade flourilhed all over his Dominions, and he was beloved by all his Subjeds, but being of a quiet Difpofition, and a great Bigot to the Mahometan Religion, difpofed himfelf to Prayer and hearing Sermons, and left the Management of his Government to a young er Brother, called Rajah Motidah, a covetous tyrannical Prince. The King never came ouC Vol. II, G of^8 A new Account of his Palace, but devoted himfelf w holly to the Company of Prieits, who fed his Mind with their Nonfenfe and Cant, and his Bro ther keeping fair with the Prieils, came to opprefs the People, and keep the King igno rant. I had the Honour to be acquainted with him before he was King, and had free Accefs to him when he was King; but his Brother never fuffercd me to be alone w^ith him, left I lliould have difcovered fome of his evil -Praftices, which I certainly had done, if I could have found an Opportunity, and to have forewarned him of the Danger he was falling into. In Anno 1703. I called at Johore'm my Way to China, and he treated me very kindly, and made me a Prefent of the Ifland of Sincapure, but I told him it could be of no Ufe to a private Perfon, tho a proper Place for a Company to fettle a Co lony on, lying in the Center of Trade, and being accommodated with good Rivers and fafe Harbours, fo conveniently fituated, that all Winds ferved Shipping both to go out and come into thofe Rivers. The Soil is black and fat: And the Woods abound in good Mails for Shipping, and Timber for build ing. I have feen large Beans growing wild in the Woods, not inferior to the beft in Eu rope for Tafte and Beauty; and Sugar-cane five or fix Inches round growing wild alfo. In 1708. the King's Brotherperfwaded him to leave Johore Latin^ and refide at Rhio on the Illand of Bintang, about three Leagues off the River of Johore, becaufe he thought heof the Eaft Indies. oo he could aft his Tyranny with more Securi- ty than on the main Continent, and e engrofled all Trade in his own Hands, buying and felling at his own Prices, and punilhing thofe who dared to fpeak acainft his arbitrary Dealings. At laft, in i 7 \x. a Kebellion broke out, that nothing could flop but a Revolution, which diflblved the State into Anarchy. Upon the Rifing of the People, the Tv- nni rv^T rd , of a Galle y' wi| ;h his Wives and Ululdren, and carried with him above a f un ^.'Sht of Gold, and, without taking Leave of his Brother, fled to Jo/jore Lam,, iut finding a fmall Army of (whom the 1 eople had invited to their Affi- r „ n , ce 1 ). ''d^ken theirQuarters there, he be- ook himfelf to the Woods with his Familv, u i Gal,e y and Gold a Prey to them He knew that there could be no long Safety in tne \\ oods, and defpairing of Mercy from the injured People, made Defperation fupply the I lace of Courage. He firft killed his Wives and Children, but began to helitate about killing himfelf, but a Page of twelve Vears of Age asked him if he was afraid to die a Prince rather than be butcher'd like a Slave by fome Villain or Slave's Hand, and at he' tho' innocent, and who might ex pert Mercy, would fliew him the Way to die, and with that took a Crefs, and run himfelf through the Body. The Tyrant pre- lently followed the Youth's Example, and immediately expired; but the Monacahoes G com-100 A new Account coming foon ^fter to the tragical Place, faw what had been done, and found the Boy a- live, and in hisSenfes. They ftopt^his blood ing Wound, and carried him to Johore La- mi till his Strength returned. W hen the King heard of the People's Mu tiny, and his Brothers Flight, he came out of his Palace, and proferred to fettle the State in its former Tranquillity, and if that could not appeafe them, he thought nothing elfe could bring them to Reafon, but his Life, which he would willingly facrifice to atone for his Mal-adminiftration. The People told him, that he was too re ligious to make a good King, and that he might retire to 'Pahaung or Trangano, and fpend his Time, but as for Johore and the I- llands between Sumatra and it, they would conlider what to do with them, and lo gave him fome Vellels to carry him and his Fami ly, with others who would follow his For tune, to Trangano. On his Way thither, he called at c Pulo- nnre^ Ttngi, tPiJfane and Timooii, and the In habitants of thofe Ifiands received him with Demonftrations of Love, and promifed to continue in their Duty as his Subjeds. He put his eldeft Son, a Youth about twenty Years of Age, afhore at 'Pahaung, to keep that Country from revolting, and went him- felf to Trangano, where I afterwards had the Honour to fee him, and there I leave him at prefent, and return to thofe Ifiands that ly round his Dominions.

Queen Elizabeth of England fent the Queen of Atcheen a Com pliment of fome Englijh Rarities, among which were fome Brafs Guns, with the z\rms of England on them, and the Friendlhip cul tivated by the two Queens, procured great Indulgences from the Queen of Atcheen, to the Emhjh who traded to her Country. About the Year 1675-. the Ttutch made War on her, becaulc fhe would not permit them to fettle a l J adory at Atcheen, or rather, to make her their Vaflal. r rhey fliut up the Port of At cheen v by their Shipping, and ftraitned the lown tor Want of Provifions and other Ne- G 3 ceflaries,102 A new Account cellaries, that came yearly from Bengal, but an End'tji? Ship came from thence with Rice and Cloth proper for the Market; but the 'Dutch, after their ufual Manner, forbad the Engltjh Traffick, while they had a War. The Mailer of the Englifl? Ship being afraid of Ruin by the Lofs of his Voyage, fent Ad vices to the Atcbeeners to be ready near the Shore on a Night that he appointed, and he would run his Ship afliore in the Bay, loaded as /he was, and they might have both the Corn and Cloth, whether the 'Dutch would or no, which Projed was put in Pra^ice, and had the defired EfFe^, with the Lofs of the Ship only. This Piece of Service fo pleafed the Queen, that fhe called a Coun cil of her Orankays, and magnifying the Engltjh Friendfhip, in a full Council declar ed all Englijh free of Atcheen, to pay for a Ship with three Malls, icq Tayels, or about 80 L, Sterl. as a Prefent to the Queen, in Lieu of all Cultoms, let the Cargo be never fo rich, and for a Brigantine or Sloop 40 Tay- els, and that no Englijh Goods fhould be carried to the Cultom-houfe, or furveyed in their own Houfes, and that all Englijh Mer chants Houfes were to be reckoned as San ctuaries to luch as could not pay their Debts, or had committed any flight Fault. This Harmony continued till the Year T700. that the Queen died, and a Seld or Preacher getting a ftrong Party, was made King, promifing to do Wonders; but, in all my Travels, I never found a civil Govern mentof the Eaft Indies. 103 inent, with a Prieft at the Head of it, pro- Iper long, and fo it fell out here. The firfi; Thing ot Moment he contrived, was to make the Lnglijh pay 10 per Cent. Cuftoms on the Cjoods they imported, which they would not come into, nor would they unlade their Ooods, but on the old Footing. In May 1701.1 arrived there with a great bhip, and good 1'orce, for it was dangerous to trarhck by Sea, becaufe of the Impedi ment that the French and the Pirates gave to Trade in India. I had on board a rich Car go from Surat^ and, on my Ai rival I took the ^hap at the great River's Mouth, according to Cullom. This Chap is a Piece of Silver about 8 Ounces Weight, made in Form of a t-rols, but the crofs Part is very Ihort, that we take with both Hands, and put to our r ore-head, and declare to the Officer that brings the Chap, that we come on an h on eft Dehgn to trade, and after that Ceremony is over, we go in our Boats freely to the Town, which ftands about four Miles up the River; but, before we take the Chap, no Boat mult go on Penalty of a Fine. \V h en I came to Town, I went to pay my V ifit to the Shawbundaar, who isCuflom- mafter, and common Arbitrator of Differen ces arifing among Merchants. Some Gentle men that refided there, and fome Mailers of omps belonging to the Engli/h, accompani- ed me. I carried my Boat's Crew, armed with r uzee and Bayonet, for my Guard. Af- tei tome (Compliments had paft between the G 4 Shaw-104 ^ nm -de count Shawkundaar and me, he told mc, that if I had a Mind to trade there, I muft carry my Goods to the Cullom-houfe, and there to be opened, and 10 per Cent, laid by for the King, whether we fold the reit there or no. I told him that was a new Method that I did not underiland, and could not come into, but withal advifed him to take Care how their King quarrelled with the Englijh, who were as capable to reduce them to Straits as the Dutch were, when the Englljh relieved them. He anfwered me, that they were not afraid of what the Englljh could do, for their Pow er being divided, they could do nothing but threaten. I took my Leave of him abruptly, and told bim, that we knew how to fight in Defence of our Rights and Privileges better than how to threaten. There were three Engltjh Vef- fels lying in the River, which had paid their Cufloms and fold their Cargoes at under Rates, and two Merchants that refided at Atcheen. .We all dined together, and, after Dinner, held a Confultation how to behave in this Affair, that affe61ed our Merchants in general, who traded thither. At lall it was agreed, that I fliould a/Tilt the Merchants in getting their Effefts off on board of my Ship, and to get their Veffels out of the River, by the Aflifbnce of my Boats and Men, and then to fhut up the Port, all which was done in one Day and a Night. I then fent a Lin- puift to tell the Shawbundaar, that flnce the were denied Trade at their Port, we for-of the Eaft Indies. iqj forbad Trade to any other Nation, and de- fired that no Boats might pafs out of their Rivers, either to trade or fift, on their Peril. They continued quiet two Days, and on the Third they fent iome Boats off, from afandv Bay about three Miles from our Ship I fent two Boats well mann'd to feize their Nets but afToon as they perceived my Boats, they' ran theirs alliore, and took out what was in them; and as my Boats were rowing near the Shore within a Mile of my Ship, about 4° or fa Muskets were fired on them out of lome Bullies that grow thick, a little Wav from the Strand. My Boats fired in their 1 urn at the Place where they faw the Smoke, and i made a Signal to bring them aboard a- gam, and found only two of my Menflieht- ly wounded. 5 T h e fame Evening we had Advice, that they were about mounting three Culverins that lay in a little fort on the River's Side, as we go to Town. I immediately ordered' my Armourer to get about ico Ihort Spikes of levcral Sizes, and harden them well, and carried them in my Boat, which I double manned, and coming into the River, we e- ipied a great Number of Men in the Fort. I lowed directly towards it, and they within ex- pefting to have a Meffage to carry to the King, Hood gazing till we came clofe to the u all, and then we faluted them with a Show, er of twenty or thirty Granadoes, that fo fnghtned them, that happy was lie who got hi it away. We then entred the Fort, and found106 A new Account found fome wounded Men in it. We pre- fently fpik'd up the Vents of the Guns, and left them, and came at our Leifure aboard again. A Day or two after,as my Boat was rowing along the Shore,towards a that was com ing in towards the fmall River, they again fired out of their Bufhes, I had forty two Guns mounted on my Ship, and bringing my Broad- fide to bear, I got five and twenty on that Side, and pointing them well among the Trees and Buflies where we obferved the Smoke to a- rife, we gave them a Volley of great Shot in return of their Volley of fmall. By Report our great Shot did fome Execution, but par ticularly on the poor Filhers, who had a Village a little within the Woods, that we did not fee. This Stoppage of Trade and Fifhing, and killing and wounding the People, made a great Noife among the poorer Sort, having in nine Days Time found more of theEffeds of Hoflility, than ever they did in their Lives before, and fo gathering together in great Numbers, went in a Body to the Palace, threatning Vengeance on theCaufersof their Calamity, and if the Englijh were not reflored to their ancient Privileges, they would have a Woman to reign again. A Nephew of the deceafed Queen lived then privately at Tedier, a Town about feven Leagues off. Some Orankayas who were difcontented with the new King's Govern ment, firfl becaufe he was a Foreigner, and thatof the Eaft Indies. loy th&lt;it the Aftdii s of Stiite were ill m^nsffeci nnd that a \\ ar with the En^lijb was im pending, wrote to that Gentleman, that .if he would come to them with a fmall Force, they would raife a Party to dethrone him that reigned, and he might have a fair Chance to fucceed him. H owever , the reigning King not ex- petting that his new Cuftoms would'meet with fuch Oppolition, fent an Orankaya aboard of my Ship, with the Linguiit, to know why we made War on him. We replied that he was the AggrelTor, by robbing us of our juit Rights and Pri^leges, acquired by our Services, and at 0lir ^ oars 5 fo we wondred that the King could ask a Reafon of us. The O- rankaya told us, that he had brought a Pow er to make up all Differences on the King's I ai t, but that we mud confent to fome new Things, as that we lliould pay no Cuftoms, but a Prefent as before, but that our Goods muft go to the Cullom-houfe, and there to be opened, and was going on, but I inter- rupted him, and told him he had demanded more than could be granted already, fo he might fave himfelfthe Trouble of makino-far ther Demands. When he found that nothing new could be obtained, hefaid he would car ry our Anfwer to the King, which he did- and the lame Kvening Proclamation was cried through the Streets, that the Englijh might a- gain repair to their refpetfive Houfes, and trade on the old Foundation. N extio8 A new Account N ext Day I went to wait on the Shaw- bundaary but carried a Guard of twenty Eu ropeans. He askt me why I carried fo many arm'd Men in my Company. I told him that I underftood there were like to be Commo tions in the Country, and I was refolved to be neuter, and would not be infulted by either Parry. He begg'd that I would land fome Bales of Goods, to fhew that we were recon ciled, which I did, to the no fmall Joy of the Town's People, who were quite tired with their new King's Experiments. But the Clamours of the People did not ceafe. For when they had News of their de- ceafed Queen's Nephews raifmg Forces to come to Atcheen, the Diforders of the State increafed, but I left them, and purfued my Voyage to Malacca and Johore^ where I met with the Scots fecond Supercargo, as is before mentioned. Atcheen affords nothing of itsownProduft fit for Export, but Gold Duft, which they have pretty plentiful, and of the finell Touch of any in thofe Parts, it being two per Cent. better than Andra-ghiry ox Tahaung Gold, and is equal in Touch to om Guinea. They do not dig for it, but catch it in GuU'teSyOt little Rivulets, as it walhes oft'the Mountains, and one particularly, a very high Mountain in Form of a Pyramid, called Gold Mount, which by Report furniihes them yearly with above 1000 Pound Weight. • E l e p h a n t s are very plentiful at Atcheen, ^nd confequently their Teeth, which theSu- ratof the Eaft Indies. 109 rat Merchants buy up for their Markets. In 1701. I faw one who had been kept there a- bove 100 Years, but by Report was then 300 Yedrs old, he was about 11 Foot high, and had a vaft Deal of Sagacity. When any young male Elephant grows unruly, which they ufually do in rutting Time, and break their Fetters and go aftay, this old Elephant is immediately fent outi and following the Track df his Foot, will find him out, and bring h?m back to his Stable, either by fair or foul Means. At Atcheen they have a fmall Coin of Leaden Money called Gafli, from twelve to fixteen Hundred of them goes to one Mace* or Maffcie. The Maffcie is a fmall Gold Coin of fourteen Pence current, but in Value a- bout twelve Pence Englijh, I have taken a Gold Maffcie, and put it with a Maffcie of Calh, and thrown them into a Puddle of Wa ter, and the Elephant would find out the Gold among the Lead, by the nice Feeling of his Probofcis. There is a very comical Piece of Revenge he took on a Taylor in Anno 1691. A Ship called the 'Dorothy, commanded by Captain Tbwaits, called at Atcheen for Refreftiments in her Way from England to Bengal, and two Englijh Gentlemen refiding then at At- cheen, went aboard to furnifli themfelves with what European Neceflaries they had Occafion for; and, amongftother Things, they bought fome Norwich Stuffs for Clothes, and there being no Englijh Taylor to be had, they em ployedno A new Account ployed a Surat Taylor, who kept a Shop on the Bazaar, or great .Market-place, and had generally half a Dozen, or half a Score Work men to few in his Shop. It was the old E- lephant's Cullom to reach in his Trunk at Doors or Windows as he pafTed along the Side of a Street, begging decayed Fruits or Roots, which the Inhabitants generally gave him. As he was one Morning going to the Ri ver to be wafhed, with his Carnack, or Rider on his Back, he chanced to put his Trunk in at the Taylor's Window, and the Taylor piickt him with his Needle, inltead of giving an Alms. The Elephant feem'd to take no Notice of the Affront, but went calmly onto the-River, and was wafhed, and being done with wafhing, troubled the Water with one of his fore Feet, and then fucked up a good Quantity of that dirty Water into his Trunk, and paiiing unconcernedly along the fame oinc of the Street where the Taylor's Shop \vas, he putin his Irunkat the Window, and blew his Nofe on the Taylor with fuch a rorcc and Quantity of Water, that the poor 1 ay or and his Life-guard, were blown off the ^kle they wrought on, almoft frightned out of their ^ oenfes, but the EngUJh Gentlemen nad their Clothes fpoiled by the Elephant's comical, but innocent Revenge. No Place in the World puniflies Theft ^ j &amp; r f at:er Severity tiian Atcheen, and yet Koobciies and Murders are more frecuent there than in any other Place.

This Place lets a Boundary to the Kingdom of Atcheen Ayerbmme is the next Place of Notice. It produces Gold and Pepper, it lies about one Degree to the Northward of the /Equator, and has the Advantage of a good fafe Har- bour, but it is little frequented, becaufe of the Treachery of the Natives, who make mail Account of murdering Strangers, if thev can but get the leaft Advantage by it. The Harbour lies in a fmall but deep Bay, and three imall Iflands lying before it, make it a moft excellent Harbour; and theChanels between the lilands, and between the Shore and the 'lands, are clear of Danger. The North End ot 1 ullo-nayas lies about twenty Leagues without it. The Inhabitants of that lifand prove the beft Slaves in India, and are fold at an higher Price in the Atcheen Market than any others. Tadang is about twenty Leagues to the Southward of the Equator, where the 'Dutch have a Colony, and a llrong Fort to defend it from the Inlults of the Natives.

The Ifland of Good Fortune lies a- bout 10 Leagues without it. Indrapura is the next, and lies about fifty Leagues to the Southward of the ^Equator. It was formerly an Englijh Fa ft or y, but the 'Dtitch infulted it in King lV'tLliam\ War with France^ and it has made but a forry Fi gure in Trade fince. Its Commodity is only Pepper, but it affords great Plenty of it, and very cheap. The Ifland of Nafaw lies about 15' Leagues without it. Bencolon is an Englijh Colony, but tlie is//- rope an Inhabitants not very numerous. A- bout the Year 1690. the Eaft-india Compa ny built a Fort there, and called it Fort, but Brick or Stone Walls in that Country can not long continue firm, becaufe Concuflions of the Earth are fo frequent by Earthquakes, that folid Walls are rent by the lhaking of their Foundations. It has the Conveniency of a River to bring th^r Pepper out of the inland Countries, but great Inconveniencies in fiiipping it off on board the Ships, for there is a dangerous Bar at the River's Mouth, which has proved fatal to many poor Men. The Road for Shipping is alfo incon venient ; for in the South-wefl Monfoons, there being nothing to keep the great Swell of rolling Seas off them, but a Imall Ifland called Rat Ifland, t^e Ships are ever in a vio-of the Eaft Indies. 115 violent Motion while that Monfoon lafts. 1 he inland Princes are often at Variance among themfelves, and fometimes are trouble- om to the Trade of our Colony, but as their ars arc ^orr, the Enolijh are in little Dan ger by them. In the Year 1693. there was a great Mortality in the Colony, the Gover nor and his Council all died in a fhortTime ater one another, and one IVlr. beinff the eld eft Fador, had his Rcfldence at man, or Trtaman^ a fubordinate Faftory to Bencolon, being called to the Government of the Colony, but not very fit for that Charge, becaule of his intemperate drinking, it for- tuned in his fliort Reign, that four Princes ij n-f.

A n d ever fince that Time there has been a bucccliion of moderate Governors, andfome nave been guilty of as much Temerity the o- u av- Tor in Anm 1719, the then Go- H x ver-ii6 A nm Account vernor, having fome Difputes with fome of the Natives, was fome what fearful of them. On a feftival Day, in firing Guns, a Wad from one of them fet Fire to an Houfe thatcht with Reeds, and feveral others con tiguous to it took Fire fromit,fothatitfpread through the Market Place. The Governor believing it to be done maliciouflyby the Na tives, left the Fort predpitantly, and got on board of a Ship in the Road, leaving fome Chefts of Money, and all the Artillery, Arms, Ammunition, and other Effefts of his Maflers, behind him, and his Garifon, following their Leader, left their Pofts, and got aboard alfo. The Natives being furprifed with the fudden Departure of theEngliJh, went into the i 'ort, and took what they had moft Occafion for; but fome Chinefe Merchants, who had fettled at Beiicolon, being alfo frightned, em barked on their VefTels, and difperfed them- felves in Places where they thought they might be moft feeu re. T he chief Merchant of the Chinefe^ who is generally called the China Captain, in the Places where the Chinefe have Trade, went to Batavia to lome Relations he had there, but the c Dutchy according to their wonted Hofpitality in India, punilhed him as a Cri minal, and taught him to make Lime and car ry Stones the Remnant of his Days, for dar ing to fettle among the En^lijh. Some of the Chinefe I law the fame Year at Trangano in Johore, who gave me this Account. Where- everof the Eaft Indies. fW ever thefe poor Chinefe came, in Places where the 'Dutch had Power, they were as heartily perfecuted as a Poor T rote ft ant is that takes Sanduary in a Country where the holy, chari table, zealous Clergy have Power. T h e Natives were almoll ruined by the En- glijh Defertion. For as their Trade lay all on their Pepper, none came to buy it, and their Regret being known at Fort St. George, there was a new Governor fent back with a new Garifon, to take PofTeffion again of their own Fort. .What the Company lofl by that unaccountable Piece of Temerity, I know not, but they gained very little Credit by it. The Country above Bencolon is moun tainous and woody, and I have heard that there are many Vulcanoes in this Ifland ; but whatever may be the Caufe, the Air is full of malignant Vapours, and the Mountains are continually clothed with thick heavy Clouds, that break out in Lightning, Thunder, Rain, and fhort-liv'd Storms. Their Food is not fit for every Stomach. Tame Buffalo may be had, but no Cow-beef. Poultry are fcarce and dear, and fo is Fifh, but fome Sorts of Fruits are pretty plentiful ; however, the Gentlemen there live as merrily, tho' not fo long, as in other Places blell with Plenty, and fo fociable, that they leave their Eftates to the longelt Liver.

There is no Place of Com merce or Note between Sillebar and Lam- foun Point, which is the Southwardmoft Point on Sumatra, nor any Thing remarkable on the Sea-lhore, but a fmall Village called T 3 //- fangetiy which has a fmall low Ifland lying a little Way off it, and there is above 40 Fa thoms deep within an Englijh Mile of the Shore. And the Ifland of Engano lies in the Offing, about 20 Leagues from it. It is an Ifland about 3 Leagues long, uninhabited, very fmooth, without Mountains, and may be feen nine or ten Leagues off. Lampoun lies twenty Leagues from the Point within the Streights of Sun da, at the Bottom of a deep Bay. The Englijh had a good Pepper Faftory there, but'it being a Part of the King of Bantams Dominions, that Factory was loft when the 'Dutch com pelled the Englijh to leave Bantam, in Anno 1683. and what produces, is carried to them at Bantam.

THERE are no other Places of Note on that Part of the SumatraCozR, till we come to C PuLLambam, which lies oppollte to the North-weft Point of the Ifland of Banka, about four Leagues dillant from it. Tullambam is a T&gt;utch Fatfory that brings them great Quantities of Pepper, being un der Contraft with the King of Tullambam, and other inland Princes, to take off all their Pepper at a certain Price, I think it is for 10 ^cccs of Eight, or 5*0 'Shillings Ster, a Ba- haar, of 400 Pounds EngLiJh futtle Weight, one Half to be paid in Money, and the other Half in Cloth. The Cloth Part the Compa ny pays at 70 per Cent, on the prime Coft; but all other Nations are debarr'd Commerce there, except the Chinefe, and by their Means the Englijh come in for a Share of their Pep. per, as our Ships pafs through the Streiehts of Banka. 1 ullambam lies about eight Leagues from the Sea, on the Banks ot a large RiVer, which divides it Icit into feveral ]&gt;ranches, and they difemboque at four Mouths into the Sea. The 'Butch keep two fmall Sloops cruifing about thofe Mouths of the River, to prevent Smug gling, but I and many others have found Ways and Means to lade our Ships full with Pep- ^ 4 per.ii; i\ iio A new A per, notvvithilanding the ftrid: Guard. An hundred Pounds to the King, and as much to the 'Dutch Chief, make a Cargo of a thou- fand Bahaars eafily procur'd. T he TullambamVewzx is very foul, info much that we feldom find lefs than 10 or 12, per Cent. Garblage, but then we buy it for nine Pieces of Eight a Bahaar. The Dutch lade off about 3000 Tuns per Annum^ from this Place, and the Chtnefe and Natives lade off as much more. The Natives are obliged to carry theirs to Batavia, and fell to the Dutch Company, but if they meet with a Market by the Way, they'll embrace it ; for the Company's Payment being moft in Cloth at high Rates, they are not fond of trading with them. The Dutch Company formerly drove a good Trade in Ophlum, at ^Pullambam^ which (like French Claret and Brandy) drew much ready Calh out of his Country, as thofe do out of ours, but in Anno 1708. the King or dered only the Importation of three Chefts, each containing about 160 Pound Weight, and if Smugglers were detected, they paid their Goods and Lives for their Difobe- dience, The Illand of BankaXy'mg fo near theCoaft of T ti I lamb am, I'll take a View of itaslpafs along.

T « e Natives of the Illand are, as mofto- ther Malay as, very treacherous, inhumane and inholpitable to Strangers, who have the Mif- fortune to be ihip-wrackt on that Coaft I knew one Captain Telling, who belonged to fome Gentlemen of Ate hem, and had the Misfortune to be flnp-wrackt there, and thev cut him off and all his Crew, except two Boys who were made Slaves: But I know a ery honeft ingenious Gentleman now alive inli% A new Account in England^ who had better Fortune, for? after his Ship was loft in the Streights of Banka* he and his Men directed their Courfe to Tullarnbam, where a very hofpitable 'Dutch Gentleman, who fortuned to be Chief of the 'Dutch Affairs at that Time, gave them kind Reception, and procured them Paffage for Batavia, where, fbme Years after, I was in Company with the Hoft and Gueft toge ther. Banka has a very foul Coaft for 6 Leagues within Monap 'tn Point, which is the North- weft Cape-land on the Ifland ; and over that Cape there is an high Mountain called Mo- napin Hill. On the North-eaft Coaft of the Iftand there are fo many Banks and Rocks under Water, that Navigation is very preca rious, and none but 'Panjalangs and Traws (fmall Veflels) venture to go that Trad; befides, there are no Places of Commerce on the North-eatt Side of Banker to invite a Stranger by the Profpeft of Gain, and fo I return back to the Coaft of Sumatra again, without taking Notice of- the little Pepper and Dammar that are the Produft of Banka. F rom Tullambam there are no Places of Commerce on the Coaft, till we come to Jambee, which is about 100 Englifl? Miles. Here formerly the EngLiJh had a Fadory on an Ifland. near its River's Mouth, called Ba~ rella\ but the Impediments their Trade met with from the Dutch, who had a Fadory in the Country up the River, made the Englijh Company withdraw. The Dutchkeyt a little Fadoryof the Eaft Indies. 12^ Fadiory at Jambee till 1710. and then with drew alfo. That Country produces only Pepper and Canes; and, by the Lazinefs of the Inhabitants, there is hardly any of them procurable. The Ifland Lingen lies under the Equa tor, about lo Leagues from Jambee, and as far from the River of Johore, and is a Part of the Johore Dominions. It is about twen ty Leagues long, and ten broad. It is very mountainous within, and very low towards the Sea. Its Produd: is fome Pepper and Canes, and it abounds in Porcupines, which affords them the valuable Porcupine Beakoar, Some of them I have feen as big as a W all-nut, and of the fame Shape, and pretty near in Colour, valued at 600 Pieces of Eight. Be tween Lingen and Sumatra are theStreighrs of c Drions, where generally Ships pais that go from Malacca to Batavia. o n the Sumatra Shore there are no Places of Commerce, till we come to the South Entrance of Andraghira River, and there lies Tat tap an, a Town belonging to the Domi nions oi Johore, that affords Pepper and Gold. Off the Mouth of that River about ten Lea gues ly the two Iflands of Canmon, and be tween them and the Sumatra Shore, are the Streights of Labon. Upon the Eall Side of the great Car 'tmon, is the Entrance of the Streights of Drtons ; and between the imali Carlmon and Tanjong-bellong on the Conti nent, is the Entrance of the Streights of Sin' cafure before mentioned, and alio into the StreightsIZ4 ^ new Account Streights of Governadore, the largeft and ca- fieft Paflage into the China Seas. There are many Iflands lying chick hereabout, all un der the Dominions of Johore. The 'Dutch have alfo a Faftory on the River of Andragb 'tra^ called Stack, but of no great Moment. It is fo unhealthful, that in corrigible Sots, and other Lumber of the a- ftive World, are fent thither to expiate their Offences againlt Nature, and very feldom a- ny return back to give an Account of the Sa lubrity of the Country. The Reafon may be, that yearly there are vaft Numbers of Fifh called Shades, about the Bignefs of a large Haddock, full of Bones, and Rows about one third of their own Magnitude, which come into that River to fpawn,and great Num bers of People refort thither in that Seafon to catch them, for the fake of their Rows, and throw away the reft of the Filh, which fo corrupts the Air, that few can hold out one Year, but are relieved every fix Months, except thofe who are fent for Sacrifices to TLnto. T he 'Dutch have another Factory right oppofite to Malacca, on the Side of a large River, called Ban kalis. Whether that be a Branch of Andraghira River I know not, out I believe it is, The Company vends a great Deal of Cloth and Ophium there, and brings Gold-duft in Return. That benefici al Trade was not known to the Dutch be fore 1685. that one Mr. Lttcas, a Faftor in the Company's Service at Malacca^ was ad- vifedof the Eaft Indies, itj vifed by a Malaya to fend fome Surat Baftaes dyed blue, and fome Berams dyed red, which are both coarfe Cotton Cloth much worn in that Country; and Ophium is as much in Requeft there, as Tea is with us. In 10 Years that he kept that Trade wholly to himfelf, tho' in other Mens Names, he got an Eftate of 10 or ix Tuns of Gold, or about 100000 Pounds EngLiJh) and then revealed the Se cret to the Company, who took that Trade altogether into their own Hands. There are prodigious Numbers of wild Swine about Bankalis, and, in the Months of 'December and January^ their Flelh is ve ry fweet and fat. In thofe Months great Numbers of People refort thither in fmall Traws. Some go into the Woods, and drive them towards thfe River, while others are ready with Dogs to drive them into if, and when one goes, all the Herd follows. Others are ready with Lances in their Traws, to purfue them in the Water, and lance them, and fo many as are lanced, drop down on the other Shore, and they are immediately carried to Places appointed, where there are many Fires made of Brufli-wood and Leaves of Trees, which the Woods afford in great Plenty, and, in thofe light Flames, they Unge the Hair off, and take out the Intrails, and cut them up in proper Pieces, and fait them in the 'Prows ; and every ^Praw has a Share proportionable to the Number of Men it brings. After it has lien three or four Days in Salt, they waih th« Pork, and hang icii6 A new Account it in Smoke, and then put it into Casks, which they have ready for their Purpofe, with fome dry Salt, and fell it by the Cask to the bed Bidder. And I think it is the moll favoury fait Pork that ever I tafted.

The In habitants arc uncivilized, murdering all whom they can furprife or mafter.

'Princes Ifland is clofe to the Weft Point of Java. It has a Chanel between it and Ja va, but there is fome Danger in it. There are no Inhabitants on it; but there are three Places that afford good Water, and Wood enough for Ships bound out of the Streights of Sun da to Europe, There are feveral o- ther Iflands in the Streights, as Caccotoa, 'Du- ars, in the Way, the Button and Cafe, and feveral others without Name, T he12.8 A Mia Aaomt The firft Place of Commerce on the Weft End of Java, is the famous Bantam, where the Englijh and 'Danes had their Faftories flourilhing till Anno 1682. at which Time the neighbourly Dutch fomented a War between the old King of Bantam and his Son, and becaufe the Father would not come into their Meafures, and be their humble Slave, they ftruck in with the Son, who was more cove tous of a Crown than of Wifdom. They, with the Affiftance of other Rebels, put the Son on the Throne, and took the old King Prifoner, and fent him to Batavia ; and, in 1683. they pretended a Power from the new King to fend the Englijh and Danes a pack ing, which they did with a great Deal ofln- folence, according to Cuftom. They next fortified, by building a ftrong Fort within a Piftol-ftiot of one that the old King had built before to bridle their Infolence. T he only Produf): of Bantam is Pepper, wherein it abounds fo much, that they can export 10000 Tuns per Annum, The Road is good, and fecure for the Safety of Ship ping. It is in a pleafant Bay, wherein are (e- veral fmall Iflands, which retain their Eng- lijh Names ftill; and the Natives ftill lament the Lofs of the Englijh Trade among them, but the King has much more Reafon than his Subjefts to regret the Lois of their Com merce. The Good-will the Natives bear to the Dutch may be conjedured from their Treatment, when they find an Opportunity, for if an Hollander goes but a Musket-ihot fromof the Eaft Indies. 119 from thcit 4 Fort, it is five to one if ever he returns, for they are dextrous in throwing a Lance, or fhooting of poiibned Darts thro' a wooden Pipe or Trunk; and the King ne ver redrelfcs them, pretending the Criminal cannot be found. Batavia is about 10 Leagues to the Eaft- ward of Bantam^ and a great Number of fmall Iflands ly fcattered in the Way, too te dious to mention. Tullo-panjang off Ban- tam^ and Edam off Batavia are the moft con^ ipicuous, and the Road of Batavia is almofl furrounded with Iflands, fome of, them inha bited, and fome not. Its Topography I'll re fer to another Time, with fome hillorical Accounts of it, both ancient and modem. Cherakoan is the next Colony on the Coaft, to the Eaftward of Batavia, belonging to the 'Dutch, where they have a Fort and a fmall Garifon. Tagal is alfo a 'Dutch Settlement, with a fmall Fort for its Defence; and there is no other remarkable Place till we come to Sama- rang, a good Colony, with a Fort of Mud and Wood to defend it. 'Damack and Cou~ tus, two Places that ly between Samarang and Japara, are noted, one for the Abun dance of Rice that it exports, and the other for great Quantities of good Sugars that it produces. They are peopled mollly with Chinefe, and fo is ^ Japara, which formerly had an Englijh Fadory, but now is altogether in the 'Dutch Hands. It is defended by two Forts, one V ol . II. I onI jO A new Account on an Hill, and the other in a Plain, where the Town {lands, and has a fmall River to wafli its Walls. The Road is fecured by two Iflands that ly about a League off the Town. I bought good white Sugar in Cakes here for two 'Dutch Dollars per Tecul, being 140 lb. Englifh futtle Weight. Tampeira is the next Place to the Eafl- ward, and to the Eaftward of it is Rambang, about x Leagues from it, where the 'Dutch liave a fmall wooden Fort, and a little Ga- rifon of fixteen Men. Thofe two afford no thing but excellent Teak Timber for build ing. And to the Eaftward of Rambang is Sorobay, which lies within the Ifland Aladu- ra, and, I believe, is the eaftmoft Settlement the Dutch have on the Ifland of Java. It produces much Pepper, fome Bees-wax and Iron. Sorobay is about ny Leagues to the Eaftward of Batavia, and the Country, along Shore, as pleafant and fruitful in Grain and Fruits as any in the World. Tame Cattle and wild Game are very plentiful, good and cheap. At Rambang I bought a Cow, flefliy and fat, for two Pieces of Eight, that weigh ed above 300 Weight; and wild Hog and Deer we killed daily with our Fowling-pieces, as we did alfo Peacocks and wild Poultry. The Cocks are all like one another, with red Necks and Bodies, and black Wings and Tail; and the Hens are exaftly like large Partridges. The Cocks are pretty large, and when they take Wing, they makeaNoife that may be heard half a Mile. Their Flelh is both fa-of the Eaft Indies. 121 favoury and juicy; and the wild Hog is ex- cellent. In the Woods are many flying Squir rels. Some of them I have feen taml in Ca- ges. rhey alfo have little Horfes wild in the Woods, and fome Tigers, but being not much pmehcd with Hunger, they feldom at tack Men. They have one dangerous little Animal called a Jackoa, in fhape almoft like a Lizard It is very malicious, and pifles at every Thing that offends it, and where- ver the Liquor lights on an animal Body, it prefently cankers the Flelh, unlefs immedi ate Cautenzings are ufed, and if that cannot be had, the Piece mull be cut out, for, if once it bhfters the Skin, there is no Cure for it afterwards; but he feldom fails of givino- Notice where he is, by a loud Noife callinS Jackoa. &amp; I was once at Supper with fome Dutch (jentlemen at Rambang, in an Houfethatcht with Cocoa-nut Leaves, and we were no loonei fct, but one of thofe open ed its Throat almoft over our Heads. The 'Dutch Gentlemen took the Alarm, and a- rofe from the Table in great Hafte, and ran out of the Room, calling to me, who fat ftill (not a little furprifed to fee their fudden night) to follow them, for my Life was in Janger, and, on hearing that Admonition, 1 was not long after them; but its Noife fpoil- ed our Supper. A s there are many Species of wild Ani- mals in thofe Woods, there is one particular, called the Oran Outang. It is nearclt ro human, ^ 2 ' both131 Anew Account both in Shape and Sagacity, among all the Herd of Animals. I faw one about four Foot high, grofs bodied, long Arms from the Shoulders to the Elbows. His Finger Ends reacht juft to his Knees, as he ttood up right. His Thighs and Legs plump, but too fmall in Proportion to his Body. His Feet long, and broad at the Toes, but a little too narrow at the Heel. His Belly prominent, covered with a light-coloured Fur, the relt of his Body being brown, and the Fur thick er and longer than the Belly Fur. His Head fomewhat large. His Face broad, and full. His Eyes gray and fmall. His Nofe little and flat. His Upper-lip and Under-jaw very large. He blows his Nofe, and throws away the Snot with his Fingers, can kindle a Fire, and blow it with his Mouth. And I faw one broyl a Filh to eat with his boyled Rice. The Females have their regular Menftrua, They have no Tail, and walk upright. They are of a melancholy Difpofition, and have a grave dejefted Countenance, and even when they are young, they are never inclined to play, as molt other Animals are. There is a fmallerSort, but of a different Species, cal led Oumpaes ; but their Legs and Arms are very fmall. T hey have many large Crocodiles or Al- legators in their Rivers and Mariihes, and fometimes they go a Mile or two off to Sea, and get foul of the Fiftiers Nets. I was clean ing a VefTel (that I bought at Sam or ang) on a Bed of Ooze, and had Stages fitted for my Peopleof the Eaft Indies. 133 People to ftand on, when the Water came round the Vefiel, and we were plagued with five or lix Allegators, which wanted to be on the Stage, and every Moment diilurbed our Men, fo I, and two of my Men, fat on the Veflel's Deck, and fired Muskets at them, but our Ball did them no Harm, becaufe their hard fcaly Coat was Shot-proof. At lait we contrived to flioot at their Eyes, and we Ihot at one fo. Aflbon as he found him- felf wounded, he turned Tail on us, and, with great Flouncings, made towards the Shore about half a Mile from us, and the rell following him, we were pretty quiet af ter that. A Day or two after, fome Fifhers told us, that they had feen a dead Allegator lying on the Shore, and pointed whereabout they faw him. I went, in a Boat, a(hore,and found him lying at full Length. I meafured his Length, and found, from his Nofe to his Tail, twenty feven Foot and an half, and he was about one third Part of his Length in Circumference about the Belly. I was in Samarang in 1704. in the Months of July and Auguji, when Navigation on that Coait is accounted dangerous. A War happened then to break out between the Na tives of that Part of Java and the TJutchy about the Succellion of a new Sun Suonan or Emperor, the old one demifing about that Time. The 'Dutch would impofe the old Emperor's Brother on them againil the general Bent of the Nation, and the Nobili- lity were for his eldeft Son, being the I 3 eftabli-134 new Account eltabliflied Law and Cuitom of the Coun try. I being then bound for Batavia, the Com modore defired me to carry a Pacquet of Letters for the General and his Council, which I did, and delivered them, before they were fix Days old, to the General {Jan Van Hoorn) which Piece of Service recom mended me to his Favour, which he demon- flrated afterwards in fome Indulgences I had, and fome Confidence he repofed in me. T he War begun then, lafted 10 Years longer than at firil the Dutch imagined. It taught the Javans the Art of W ar, having a great Number of Maccajfers and Ballies&gt; who had been trained up in the Dutch Com pany's Wars againft feveral Nations. Many of them came into the eldeit Son's Intereft, who having as good Courage and fubtle Stratagems, with much greater Agility of Body than the 'Dutch, made the War more terrible and dangerous than any the Compa ny had ever entred into, notwithftanding the Pretender had a large Party of Javansy and was a flirted by Maccajfers, Amboinefe, Ballies and Bougies ; but they wanted the European Difcipline that the others had who ferved the young Emperor, for they could encamp and mine as well as the Dutch. A Dutch Captain, in his March towards the Dutch Camp, fell, with his Company, into an Ambulh of Javans. Some of his Men were killed, but he, and moft of his Men were taken Prifoners. The Dutch Campof the Eaft Indies. 135 Camp was pitched on the Side of a River, and the Javans a few Miles above them on the fame River's Side. Next Day, to the Dutch great Amazement, they faw the Cap tain and his Men fwimming down with the Stream, on Bundles of Reeds, with all their Legs, Thigh-bones and Arms broken, and moft of them alive. Their Country-men took them out of the River, and ufed Means to fave their Lives, but very few lived, which put their whole Army in fome Dread, by obferving what Quarter they might ex- ped if any of them were taken Prifoners. The Religion of Java is partly Mahome tan and partly 'Pagan. The ^Pagans choofe Women to be PrieftefTes, and they are gene rally old, and well skilled in Witchcraft. And it is reported, that they have frequent Converfation with the Devil, who appears to them in an horid monftrous Shape, and the Prieftefles facrifice an Hog to him. The Em peror refides at an inland Town called Car- tafouriy about three Days Journey from Sa- marang, where I'll leave him, and proceed to T he Illand of Madura, that produces no thing for a foreign Market, but Deer Skins. They may be had in great Abundance, and very cheap. This Ifland confronts Java to its very ealtermoft Point. 1 have no Know ledge of the Iflands to the Eailward ofjava* but what I have had by Information from the 'Dutch, who are the only PoflTelTors of that Commerce, except two Engltjh Ships that fell in among fome of thofe lilands, and fo I 1 4 will13 ^ A new Account will go on in thofe lame Obfervaiions and Remarks. T obferveJ before, that Scrobay was the eaftermoft Settlement the 'Dutch have on neither have they any Footing, that I have heard of, on the South Side of that I- fland, tho' the Natives are pretty well civili zed, and as Ships from Europe fall in with that Coafl, they will bring off Provifions to fell them, particularly if they fee Engltjh Colours, for very often the Dutch c buy their Commodities, but pay nothing for them. The Ifland of Bally lies next Java to the Ea It ward. It abounds in Provilions for the Inhabitants, but affords nothing fit for Ex portation. I he Natives are daring and bold, even to Defperation. Many of them enter in the Dutch Service, and make good Soldiers. Between Java and Bally are the Streights of Bally. Lambock is next Bally to the Ea ft ward, and about the fame Magnitude. It produ ces the lame NeceiTaHes as Bally, but no thing to export. Combava is next to Lambock to the Eaft- ward, an Ifland as big as both the lall two mentioned. It produces nothing for Export. Between it and Lambock are the Streights of ylllafS) named from a Town Handing on the Shore, about the Middle of the Streights.

In Anno 1703. Captain IVright in the Leghorn Galley, loft his Paf- fage from Banjar on Borneo^ to Batavia, and by contrary Winds, and ftrong Currents, was driven to this Iftand, and anchored at a Town on the Weft End of it called Larrentoucka. Finding the Place convenient and fafe to pafs three or four Months of the Wefterly Mon- foons, he took an Houfe afliore, and kept fometime one Part of his Ship's Grew afliore, and fometimes another, to refrelh them. He gave Warning to the People of the Town not to truft his Men, but they, minding their own Profit, had trufted the Seamen about icq L. Sterl., A little before he was ready to fail, the Creditors came and demanded their Money. He refufed Payment, alledg- ing that a publick Crier had gone through the Town forbidding any Body to truft his Men, and that Crier was ordered by a Ma- giftrate to proclaim the Prohibition. The Creditors faid it was true they could not re- cover any Thing by Law, but if he valued his own Health he would fatisfie them, if not in all, yet in Part, and fo he paid one Half, which moft of them were content with, but one old Witch was nor, but threatned his Deftrudion, if Ihe had not all her Demand paid. Th e Captain knowing that the Natives were very skiltul in the Art of Poifoning,refolved to prevent their taking anyw m m 138 A new Account Way, and fo went on board to eat andfleep, and was fo cautious, that he would not lb much as tafte their green Fruits, nor fmell their Flowers, after the Time that the old Hag threatned him, and yet before he left the Place, he found himfelf much troubled with Grippings and Fluxes. I was at Batavia when he came there. He could not reach the Road with his Ship before he anchored, hut was forced to anchor without, and fenc his Boat on board of my Ship, to defire Help to weigh their Anchor. I lent a Boat with 10 Men and an Officer, to bring their Ship into the Road, which next Morning they did; the poor Man was brought to that Pafs by the Effefts of Poifon, that he could not walk without being fupported, nor could he lift his Hand to his Head. I waited on him afliore, and he defired to be carried to his ufual Quarters, at the Sign of the red Lion, kept by a Woman called Black Molly a Native of the Ifland of F lores, and he giving her an Account of his Condition, and how ignorant he was of the Caufe of it, ilie bid him be cheerful, for Ihe knew how he had been poifoned, not by any Thing ta ken inwardly, but by a Spell, and bid him recoiled himfelf, and try if he could remem ber if he had not ftept over a Bit of Paper, or the Leaf of a Flag, in going in or out of any Houfe, which, after a little Paufe, he could very well remember he had. She af- fured him that he fhould be perfedly well in a Month's Time, and llie performed her Pro- mifeof the Eaft Indies. i mife to Admiration.

The Ifland Timor lies within xo Leagues to the South of thofe four Iflands abovemen- tioned. It is a large Ifland about 90 Leagues long, and 18 broad. The Natives acknow ledge the King of 'Portugal their Sovereign, and have embraced the Romijh Religion. They permitted the 'Portuguese Colony of Maccao in China, to build a Fort on it, which they called Leifaw, and the Dutch a Fa61ory called Coup ang, but would never fuffer either to interfere with the Government of their Country. The Portuguese of Maccao drove a very advantagious Trade to Timor for many Years, and finding the Natives inclined to be palTive Cat ho licks, tried by fair Means to get the whole Government of the Country into the Church's Hands^, but could not beguile them that Way, therefore they tried torce, and commenced a War, but to their Coft they tound, that the Timoreans would not lofe their Liberty for fear of the Lofs of Blood. They chofe one Gonfales Gomez their Ge neral. He was a Native of Timor, and had travelled to Maccao and Goa. He allowed the14.0 A new Account the King of ^Portugal to be the Sovereign and Proteftor of their Country, and they would be his loyal Subjects, providing their Laws and Liberties might be fecured to them. That War with the City of Maccao lafted about fifteen Years. It began about the Year 1688. and was not quite finilhed in the 1703. and Maccao in the End was ruined by it, for it exhauited both their Stock of Men and Money to fuch a Degree, that of icoo Ci tizens the Town had before the War, there was hardly fifty left at the End of it, and of forty Sail of trading Ships, not above five left. T he Vice-roy of Goa fent anEmbafTyto Gonfales Gomez, in the Year 1698. to per- fwade him to Peace, and to accept of a Go vernor General and an Archbifliop from Goa, but to no Purpofe, for they declared, that they would admit of no foreign Governors in their Country, either in Church or State. T he Produd of the Ifland is Sandal-wood, the bell and largeft in the World, which is a great Commodity in Chma, alfo Gold and Bees-wax. The Gold is plentiful, but of a low Touch, not amounting to 10 Caratts fine. And all Manner of Provifions are plen tiful and cheap, but no anchoring about the Ifland, except at Le'ifaw and Coufang. And the Coaft is fubjed to frequent Tornadoes, or Squalls of Wind and Rain, introduced with much Thunder and Lightning. The Natives report, that at a certain Sea- fon of the Year, after the South-weft Mon- foonsof the Eaft Indies. 141 foons are fet in, they can difcern an high mountainous Land to the Southward of them, and continues in Sight from 'December to the latter End of February^ or the Beginning of March, and then disappears. If the Report be true, it mult be fome floting Illand, that comes from and goes to New Holland^ which is the next Trad of Land to the South of Timor. Thefe Accounts I had from a Tor- tu^ueze Gentleman called Alexander Tlnto^ wno was a Captain at Leifaw four Years, and was bound from Batavla to Goa^in An no 1704. He went PalTenger with me, and feem'd to be a Man of Probity. I never met with any Body that could give me any tolerable Account of the Iflands to theeallward oiT'tmor, or of New Guinea^ or New Holland^ and fol'll pafs by them, and di- red my Courfe to the Iflands of Ban da, where Cloves, Nutmegs, and Mace grow, but are now all engrofTed by the Dutch) who allow one of them called Tullo-wey, to belong to the Englijh) after they had been at 40 Years Pains to cut down all the Clove and Nut meg Trees that grew on it, and have made it Death for the Natives ever to plant any on it.

The Dutch have that Ifland Hill, with Loutore and Noro, where they reap plentiful Crops of Spice. 1 muft now fteer Weft-north-we ft about 30 Leagues, to the famous Ifland of Amboina) where14^ A new Account where as real a Tragedy was afted on the Englijh, as ever happened among Friends and Allies. The Story is too well known to need a Place here. However, at prefent it has altered its Scene, and turned prodigioufly re ligious, having no lefs than 5-0 'Dutch Tro- tejlant Churches on that holy Ifland, and the Natives are very fond and forward to turn Converts, efpecially fince fome Ambo'tnefe Youths have been fent to Holland, and trained up in their Univerfities, and ho noured with Church Orders. They coming back to their own native Land, loaded with fuch fine Qualifications, and receiving great Refpeft from their Matters the Dutch, make the Converfion of the Populace very eafie. The Dutch have fo fortified Amboina, by their own Report, that they think it impreg nable.^ It is true Vlttoria Bay is fathomlefs till Shipping come within a Mile of their Forts, and there is no other Place for ancho ring on that Side of the Ifland, but I have heard fome Dutch Officers, in difputing their Knowledge of Amboina, fay, that on that Side that fronts the Coaft of Ceram, there are fe- veral Places of anchoring at a Mile or two diftant from the Shore, and never a Fort built to impede anF.nemy's landing, and that if an Army fuperior in Force to what the Dutch have at ViBoria, would march but fixorfe- ven Leagues by Land, they might come on the Back of the Town, and lodge on Hills fo near it, that none could pafs the Streets in the Town, nor appear on their Bulwarks or Bat-of the Eaft Indies. 14.5 Batteries; but this was a Secret that the En- glijh or French ought not to know. The Ifland Ceram, near Amboina, has alfo Cloves and Nutmegs, and the 'Dutch appro priate that Illand to themfelves, and have a Fadory on it called Ambay. It is a large Ifland of 70 Leagues long, and 15- broad. Buro is alfo a 'Dutch Ifland, producing Cloves and Nutmegs. It lies Weft-north-weil of Ambo'ma, about 3^ Leagues dillant. It is about xo Leagues long, and in the Middle 10 broad. Tullo-oubyXxtsvn. the Way between Buro and Gilolo, the largell of all the Molucca I- flands. The South Part of Gilolo is called Batta-chinay and the Equator cuts the Ifland in the Middle. On the Wefl Side of Gilolo, and at a little Diftance from it, ly Batch'ian^ Matchian, MontiTidor, and Ternatey. They are but fmall Iflands, but produce the greateft Quantities of Cloves and Nutmegs, of all the Molucca Iflands. One Captain Ethrinoton^ in a Ship called the Refolution, made a Trip to Gtlolo about the Year and got 40 Tuns of Spice. He called at Batavia in his Way to England, and the Dutch being very folicitous to know where he had been, he freely told them, to let them fee the Englijh were not quite igno rant of that Navigation, if they had a Mind to follow it. I now continue my Courfe Weftward along the Equator, to the Ifland Celebes, the Eaft- Side of which Ifland, and a great Number of fmaller144 ji neiso Accou fmaller ones, are little frequented Stran gers, but on the South-well: Corner of it is Maccajfer, where the have a Factory, but its chief Produft is Corn, which indeed all thofe eaftern Illands abound in, and con- fequently in Poultry. The Natives are of a light Olive Colour, and the Women well fliaped, and pretty beautiful, for which Rea- fon they are in great Efteem among the and Chtnefe, who buy them for Bed-fellows, and often marry them.

I heard Mr. Sylvamis L an den, who had been Chief of Borneo, fay, that he much wondred 'why the Company of England Ihould have fettled a Fadory at Banjar-majfeen, where they were forced for feveral Years to keep their Fadory on Flotes of great Trees tied together, and made faft to Trees growing in the Water, on the Side of a River, with Cables made of Rottans, and when they built a Faftory, they were forced firft to drive Poles in the Ground, to make a Foundation, as the Dutch do at Amfterdam, and raife Earth on them to build upon. Captain Barry, a very ingenious Gentle man, drew the Plan, but died before the Work was brought to any great Forwardnefs, and Mr. Cunningham, who came thither from Tul- lo-condore, when that Fadory was cut off by their Macca(fer Soldiers, came to the Head of the Company's Affairs. He was bred a Surgeon, and had turn'd Virtuofo, would Ipend whole Days in contemplating on the Nature, Shape, and Qualities of a Butterfly V ol . 11.

T heir Faftory was not half finifhed be fore they began to domineer over the Na tives, 'who pa It in their Boats up and down the River, and very imprudently would needs fcarch one of the King's Boats, who was car- rying a Lady of Quality down the River, which fo provoked the King, that he fware Revenge, and accordingly gathered an Army, and Ihipt it on large 'Fraws, to execute his Rage on the Faftory and Shipping that lay on t, | e River. The Company had two Ships, and there were two others that belonged to private Merchants, and I was pretty deeply concerned in one of them. The Fadory re ceiving Advice of the King's Defign, and the Preparations he had made, left their Fadory, and went on board the Shipping, thinking themfelves more fecure on board thanafhore. VV hen a]!

Some got in at the head Door of one of the Ships, and killed iome Engl 'tjh in the Fore-callle, but they were foon deilroyed. The two great Ships, tho' in Danger, beat, off the Enemy with fmall Lofs, but the little Ships were both burnt, with moft of their Men, and one T)utch Gentleman who was obliged to flee from Ba~ tavia on one of the Imali VefTels, was alfo burnt in her.

The King thought his Revenge had gone far enough in driving them from their Settlement, and finding the Lofs of the En- gltjh Trade affe&amp;ed his Revenue, he let all Engltfl? who traded to Johore and other cir cumjacent Countries, know, that he would Itlll continue a free Trade with the En^lijh on the old Footing, but would never fiiffer them, or any other Nation to build Forts in ^ ^ his14.8 A mis Account his Country. Several Engltjh have been there fince, and loaded Pepper, and have been ci villy treated ; and the 'Dutch fent a Ship from Batavia in Anno 17ix. to trade with them, but the Natives refufed Commerce with them. The inland Country is very mountainous, but towards the Sea very low and marifliy, occnfioned by the great Rains that continue about 8 Months in the Year. It produces Rice, and many Sorts of Fruits in great A- bundance. Pepper is peculiar to the Countries about Banjaar ; and to the weft ward about Succadaanay they have fmall Diamonds, but their Waters being inclined to be yellow, are . not fo much in Etieem as thofe of Golcondah. T he Englij}) had formerly a Fadory at Succadaana, but why they left it I know nor, unlefs it was for the Unwholfomnefs of the Country; yet in Anno 1694. I met with a Ship from Fort St. George, bound to Succa- daana, commanded by one Captain Gullock, who had been there the Year before, and praifed it for a wholfom Country, and the Inhabitants very civil and obliging. He bought fome Surat Baftaes of me, at 45* per Cent. on Invoyce, and expeded to make as much himfelf. I x is reported, that on the Coaft of Bor neo, between Lao and Sobar, there are ma ny Canibals, but I never heard it confirmed by any but Chinefe. And from to Sue- cadaana, the People are civil enough to Stran gers. Sam-of the EaCt Indies. 149 Sambas is the next Country of Commerce to the Northward of Succadaana. It produces but very little Pepper, but fome Gold, Pearls, and Bees-wax, which makes it well frequen ted by the Chinefe, who carry Surat Piece- goods from Malacca and Johore, and barter to very good Purpofe for the aforefaid Com modities. Bees-wax is the current Cafli in that Country. It is melted but not refined, and call in Moulds of an oblong Square, the Breadth about two Thirds of the Length, and the Thicknefs Half of the Breadth, and a Rattan JVithy to lift them by, call; in the W ax. A Piece weighs a Quarter of a 'Fecul, which comes to in Engtijb Weight, 34 Pound, and a Tecul is valued inPayments at 10 Maffciesy or 40 Shillings SterL They have alfo for fmaller Payments Pieces of Eight to a *Fecul and Sixteenths, and for fmaller Money they have Conries. The Prince and People are very hofpitable and civil, fo that Strangers trade there with Security. I knew a French Armenian, who coming from Ma- nilla, had the Misfortune to lofe his Ship on that Part of the Coafl that belongs to the King ot Sambas. They had but little Goods, for generally Sfanijh Dollars are the common Return for Goods fold at Manilla, When the People that were fhipwrackt came afliore, they were carried to the King, who examined what they were, from whence they came, and whither bound, with what they were loaded, and feveral other Interrogatories, and then ordered them Provifions, and Men and Boats K 3 10150 A new Account to aflifl them in faving their Treafure, for there was but very little loll: befides the Ship and Stores that were not worth the Trouble of faving. The King gave him Pearls and ikes-wax for his Silver, at fuch reafonable Rates, that the Armenian gained ^oper Cent, at Batavla. ( whither he went on a Vef- fel) for the Goods he difpofed of there. At Batavia he took Pallage on board a French Ship for Chincty and in their Way called at Trangano, where I met with him inthei/ip. 1 had the whole Account from himfelf,and faw fome beautiful Pearls that he w 7 as carrying to the China Market, and among them a Pair of Pears worth fo L.

K 4 toIjz A new Account to the Town, which lies about twelve Miles up the River, where I left Rajah Bowncea, before I took my Ramble among the Illands. He was there in Anno 1719. with five or fix hundred Men to keep that Country firm to his Father. ( Pabating River runs far into the Country, and waflies the Foot of Malacca Hill. There is Abundance of Gold Dull found in it, and I have feen fome Lumps, of five or fix Ounces each. They do not dive for the Dull above three Fathoms, tho' there are fome Places in the River above Ten deep, and general ly where the deepeft Water is, moft Gold-- , dull is found. It has exported fome Years above eight hundred Weight. Along the Sides of the River Pepper is planted for Ex- 4 port, but not above 300 'Funs in a Year, be came they want Vend for more, tho 1 , if they had a Market to carry it off, in five Years Time they could make a Produft of 3000 Tuns. Belides Pepper and Gold, there are Tin and Elephants Teeth, but in no great Plenty, and the befl Canes in the World grow hereabout. The Country is woody, and is ftor'd with wild Game and Fruits, their Rivers and Sea with great Plenty and Variety of excellent Filh, but the Coun try is not reckoned very healthful, becaufe of the Abundance of Rains. Trangano is the next Place of Note for Commerce, and in An no i-jro. the Place of Relidence of a poor di- ftrell King, who by a fenfelefs Devotion to Su- peritition 5 ruin'd his Country and his own Fa^ mi'v. jof the Eaft Indies. 15^ I gave an Account before of his Brother's tragical End, and the daring Boldnefs of a Youth that lliewed him the Way to die by his own Hand. In 1719. I faw the Youth waiting on the King, and fanning him with a Peacock's Tail. In my Way to Siaw, I cal led at Trangano, anS went to wait on him, and he remembred that he had been acquain ted with me five and twenty Years before. 1 ftaid about a Week, and every Day he wanted to fee me. He often repented his taking the Weight of Sovereignty on his irhoulders, and feared that his End would ^ prove as tragical as his Brother's. Trangano ftands pleafantly near the Sea, on the Side of a River that lias ^a Iballow Bar, and many Rocks fcattered to and again with in the River, but Room enough in many Places to moore fmall Ships very fecurely, to keep them fafe from the Dangers of the Winds or Floods. There may be about one thoufand Houfes in it, not built in regular Streets, but fcattered in ten or twenty in a Place diftant a little Way from another's/ 7 //- la of the fame Magnitude. The Town is a- bove half-peopled with Chinefe, who have a good Trade for three or four Jonks yearly, befides fome that trade to Siam, Cambodia, Tun que en and Sambas. When I came back from Siam with my Cargo unfold, as I mentioned before, I came to Trangano to difpofe of what I could of my Goods, and to procure a new Cargo for Surat y the kind King aflifted me in doing both, with all154 ^ mw Account all the Readinefs and Cheerfulnefs imagin able. While my Ship lay in the Road, the Bougies came with a Fleet of two hundred Sail of Traws, defigning to plunder the Town of Trangano ; but they were afraid to pafs fo near our Guns as they muft have been necef- fitated to do before they could get into the River. When they came to a Place about ^ Leagues off, they fent a Traw to my Ship, and the Officer told me, that he had a Com- xniflion to profer and pay me 3000 Spanijh Dollars, if I would let them pafs quietly into the River. I ordered him away, and threat- ned, that, if they came, they fhould feel the Force of my Powder and Shot. When I came aihore, the King askt me if I would proted: him. I told him I would with all the Force I had. He wept, as if he had been diffident, and defired that I would take him on board of my Ship, and carry him whitherfoever I went, for his Life was bur- denfom to him, and he could trufl none of his own People. I perfwaded him that I was fincere in my Refolution to proteft him, and that it would look too mean to run away from his Kingdom, while there was a PofTibility to regain it. He told me, that he had fent Ambalfa- dors to the 'Dutch at Malacca for Alliftance, according to the ancient League between his Anceftors and them, when they joyned their Forces to expel the Tortugueze from Malacca ; but inftead of finding Relief there,of the Eaft Indies. his Enemies were aflifted with Powder and Shot, and his rebellious Subjects had a fafe Retreat at Malacca. I adviled him to take Prote6Hon from the c Dutch) and allow them the Monopolization of the Trade of his Country, and to part the Revenues between him and them. Hefeem- ed to be offended with the Propofal, but faid he would be glad if the EngLiJh would fettle in his Dominions, and fortify what Places they pleafed, and that he would wil lingly come under their Proteftion, and that there were none that ever entertained the Dutch in their Countries as Guefls but would willingly be quit of them again, if they could. J There happened to come a French Ship thither at that Time, being bound to China. The King gave the Captain and me an Invi tation to Dinner, and, after we had regaled ourfelves, we entred on a Difcourfe of the miferable State of a Country under the Ma lignancy of a civil War. He asked us, if fuch Calamities had happened to England or France. We affured him there had been often fuch Diftempers among us, but that when the Difeafe was cured, our State be came as flrong and vigorous as ever. He had feveral Times askt me, if I thought the Englijh be perfwaded to fettle a Colony in his Country, that ^Pahaunv mieht be made a Place of great Trade, if there were Shipping and Stock to carry off the Pepper and Tin which that Country alone could pro-* duce.156 A new Account duce. I told him, I could give him no En couragement to believe they would. H e then defpairing of getting an Engltjh Colony fettled, propofed to Mr. c Pedro-viL- lamont Garden^ who commanded the French Ship, if he thought the French Nation might be induced to fettle in his Dominions, and the French Gentleman gave him Hopes that the King of France might be induced to ac cept of his Friendlhip, and fettle a Colony, providing he would certify his Requefl by a Letter, which the King of Johore readily a- greed to. It was written in the Malayan Language, and tranflated by a Ch'inefe into ^Portugneze^ and I tranflated it from that Language into Englijh. The Original and the Englijh Tranflation were delivered to the French Captain, but I never heard of it fince. H e told me, that when I came to Bombay, I ftiould acquaint the Governor of the De- fire he had to live under the Protedion of the Englijh, and that with 150 Men they might bridle the Infolence of his own rebel lious Subjefts, and their Allies the Bougies too. Trangano is a very pleafant and healthful 1 Country, and affords a fine Land-skip from the Sea. The Hills are low, and covered with ever-green Trees, that accommodate the Inhabitants with Variety of delicious Fruits, fuch as Lemons, Oranges, Limes, Mangoes, Mangojlans, Ramboflans, Letchees and i)u- reans: And in the Vallies, Corn, Pulfe and Sugar-of the Eaft Indies. 157 Sugar-canes. The Ground is cultivated by the Chine fey for the lazy Malay as cannot take that Trouble. The Produft of the Country is Pepper and Gold, which are moftly exported by the Chinefe. About 300 Tuns are the common Export of Pepper, and we have it almoll for one half of the Price that we pay for Ma labar Pepper. From the Month of Ottober till March, their River is Ihut up by the Bar, which fills up by the Impetuofity of the great Seas fent on that Shore by the North-eaft Monfoons; but in the Months of Jtily and Auguft their Seas produce the fined Fifh that ever I faw or tailed. There is one Sort ex- adHy like a Salmon, both in Shape and Tatte, but the Filh is white, as the Salmon is red. Their Poultry are large, plump and fweet, but Beef is fcarce, except Buffalo Beef, and that is plentiful enough. In Anno 1710. the Bougies came toTullo- cafafs, which is but five Leagues from Tran- fano\ but there are other Illands that ly n xagues more foutherly, called, in the Maps, by the Name of Tullo-capafs. but their right Name, which the Natives call them by, is 'Pullo-tetang. However , from Tullo-capafs the Bou gies fent an Am bally to Trangano, pretend ing an Accommodation with the King, to fee if he would allow them to enjoy the Conti nent and Iflands beyond the Promontory of Romano, and they would leave him the qui et FofTeflion of the re{t;v and, while they were158 A new were in a large Hall conferring, fome unufu- al fudden Noife happened to be heard from without, which the guilty Bougies taking to be fome Defign in Execution againft them, one of them runs to the King, and creft him to the Heart, which made a very great Dif- order, and many were killed on both Sides ; and what Bougies remained, got on board of their Gallies, and pofted to their Fleet at ^Pullo-capafsy with the News of what had happened at Trangano, and next Day the Bougies went into the River, and plundred the Town, except 'certain Houfes which be longed to the ^Dattabandaar, or firft Mini- (ter, whom the King, in his Life-time, ever miflrufted, but, by the ill Situation of his Af fairs, was obliged to' hide his Thoughts, and defer his Refentments till a proper Time. The next Place, to the Northward, in the Johore Territories, is at any. It was for merly the greateft Port for Trade in all thofe Seas, but^ the Inhabitants being too potent to be afraid of the King's Laws, they became fo infolent, that Merchants were obliged to remove their Commerce to Countries of more Security. It was the ftaple Port for Surat Shipping, and from Goa^ Malabar and Chormondel they had a good Trade, and fo they had from China, Tunqtiin^ Cambodia and Siam ; but the Merchants finding no Reflraint on Robbers and Murderers, were obliged to give their Trade a Turn into another Chanel, which was a great Advantage to Batavia, Siam and Malacca, where they were kindly ufed,of the Eaft Indies. 159 ufed, and in thofe Ports it has continued e- ver fince. The Johore Dominions reach but four or five Leagues farther North, which, like molt Borderers, are inclined to Rapine, and lying fo near another's Dominions, where they may be fcreened from the Power of their own Laws, when they commit Depredations, it makes them exercife their Villanies with Impunity. Between Tranvano and c Patany\y the Iflands of Redang, They are uninhabit ed, but fometimes the Saleeters or Malaya Freebooters frequent them, and when they meet with trading VefTels that they are able to mafter, they make Prize of them, and car ry the Men into other Countries than where they belong to, and fell them for Slaves; and when they meet with no Purchafe at Sea, they go afliore in the Nights, and ileal all they can get. Men, Women and Chil dren go all into the Booty; but the China. VelTels afford them moft Prizes. The Kings of Johore ever paid Homage to the Kings of Siam, by fending them a Rofe made of Gold in a golden Box once in three Years. The Year 1719. happened to be the Year that the Rofe, came, for I faw the Melfenger that brought it at Siam y where he had Orders from his Mafler to know how my Affairs went, with a Profer of the King's Service, if I came back into his Country. Chap.I do A CHAP. XLVII. Gives an Account of the 'Dominions and City ^Siam, with Remarks on the Revolution that happened there. SANG O RE is the firft Town on the King of Siams Dominions. On that Side it is under the Government of Ligore, which was once the Metropolis of a Kingdom of the fame Name, but, by civil DifTenfions, it be came a Prey to the King of Siam. Sangore ilands on the Side of a large Ri ver. It yields fome Tin, Elephants Teeth, Agala-wood and coarfe Gold, but the Inha bitants meet with lb great Difcouragements in digging for Tin, that there is very little to be procured; and what is manufadured, is bought up by the 'Dutch Faftory at Ltgore. Ligore lies about ix Leagues to the North ward of Sangore, and between them lies a low uninhabited Ifland, called ^Papier. It reaches from Sangore within 3 Leagues of Ligore River. It is well itored with wild Buffaloes, Hog and Deer, which are free for all Perfons to kill at Pleafure. The Road of Ligore lies two Leagues from the River, and about a League within the River's Mouth Ilands the 'Dutch Fadory, a pretty commodious Houfe, built of Brick, after the Dutch Fafhion. The Town Itands about two Miles above the Fadtory, It is built of Bambows, and thatcht with Reed. There are many Tagan Temples in it, which have Steeplesof the Eaft Indies. 161 Steeples built very high, in Form of very fharp Pyramids. They are fo fmall, that, in the Road, they look like Ships Mails. It produces Abundance of Fin, but the Dutch engrofs it all. Tullo Car a, an high Ifland, lies about ix Leagues off Ligore, The next Place of Note is Cut, a Place that produces great Quanti ties of Tin and Elephants Teeth, but all are fent to the City of Siam or Odia tor the King's Ufe. The reft of the Coaft being little frequented, I will pafs by it, and fteer for the Bar of Siam. The City {lands on an Ifland in the River Memnon, which, by Turnings and Windings, makes the Diftance from the Bar about 5-0 Leagues. The Country is low, and as fruitful -a5'any Spot of Ground in the World, in Rice, Legumen, Fruits and Roots, Cattle wild and tame. And the River a- bounds in many Species of excellent Fifli, which plentifully indulge the Inhabitants, and make them indolent and lazy, and confe- quently proud, fuperftitious and wanton. T he City is reckoned ten Miles round the W alls, and many Canals, from the River, pierce thro' the City from all Quarters. The Walls of the City are high and thick, built oi Stone and Brick ; but the Houfes of the Na tives, tho' large, are low, built on Stakes driven into the Ground, about 10 or 12 Foot high; but the Mahometans^ Chinefe and Chrifiians raiie the Grounds they build on high enough to be fecure from the yearly Inundations. The Na- V ol . IT. L tivesI l6z A new Account tives Houfes are raifed on thofe Stakes on the fame Account, and as their Walls are built of Bambow and Reeds, their Roofs are built of the fame Materials, and are all thatcht, except what are built on Terra firma^ and they are ge nerally tiled. There are many arch'd Bridges in the City, built of Brick or Stone, and fome of Wood. The Floors of the Natives Hou fes are made of fplit Bambow or Reeds made fafl together, fo that one cannot move on them without both Noife, and fhaking them. The three Palaces of their Kings, and fome Temples, are the only magnificent E- difices in the City; and fome Steeples be longing to the Temples are gilded with Gold on the Outfide, and in a Sun-lbine they re- fled: the Rays fo flrongly, that, at two or three Miles Diftance, they dilluib the Eye, when lookt upon. They have many large Temples well de corated after their Way, and well llocktwith gilded Images of Gods and GoddelTes, of the Priefls Contrivance and Canonizing, and they never want Devotees to adore them, who pay their deceitful Impofers very well for de ceiving them; but they are not the only People that are fo cunningly deluded, for the fatal Cuftom has fpread univerlally in all the Corners of the World. The great God, who created the Uni- verfe, they have no Image of, nor can they make any of him, becaufe he never fliewed himfelf in any bodily Shape, and therefore they can form no Idea of his Shape, Dimenllons or. of the Eaft Indies. idj or Beauty; but T'tfedah, the great God's Part ner has often fhevved himfelf, and him they worfhip in his Image with the higheft Ado- J [ ^ ration. 'Praw c Prumb and Sommo Cuddem his Friends they adore with the fecond Degree in Worfhip; and Trapout and Samfay have the third Sort of Veneration paid to their I- mages. They have many little Deities inferior to thofe above mentioned, whom they adore as Patrons or Protedors of feveral Tribes of Men, and other Animals of different Coun tries and Cities, of Health, Profperity and o- ther Chances and Cafualties, fo every one is at Liberty to choofe his own Patron or Pro- tedor, and worlhip him according to his own Mind, but none are perfecuted for the Opinion of^e^Way he is to worlhip, either the great or the little Gods. That heavenly Frenzy is only a raging mad Diftemper that affefts the melancholick Brains of the weftern World. I was in one Temple pretty large, built exadily four Square, and each Square contain ed jull an Hundred Images. They were pla ced in Notches or 'Domes about four Foot from the Ground. There were more God- defles than Gods, and all were in a fitting Potture crofs-legg'd, as Taylors fit on their Shop-boards. Their Nofes were low and fmall, their VifTage long, their Ears large, I and the Lappets of them thick and plurtip. They fat promifcuoufly in thofe Notches, and all clothed in one Livery of Gold-leaf. They L x were \16$ An™ Account were almofl as big as full-grown Men and Women, but very different in their Sub- fiances. The Priefls told us, that fome were of pure Gold, others of Tecul Silver, which has no Alloy in it, fome of Copper, and lome of Brafs, and fome of bak'd Clay; but, for Want of fumpture Laws among them, it was hard to know the Gentleman from the Beggar by their Garb, or a Lady from a Lawndrefs. I n one Temple, as I was informed, ftands the famous Sam fay twenty Yards in Height. He is in a right lineal Defcent from little Sam- fay, who caufed fo much War between Si- am and Tegu, which never ended but with the Diflblution of the Tegu Empire. In mod of their Temples there are frightful Dragons {landing Sentinels at their Gates, but whe ther theyLJire—placed-there to keep in the Gods, or to keep out Devils, I know not. T here are reckoned no lefs than fifty thoufand Clergymen or Tallapoys belonging to the Temples in and about the City of am ; but they are eafy to the State, having no flated Benefices or other Revenues, and yet they are plentifully fupplied with all the Ne- cefTaries of Life by the Charity and Benevo lence of the Laity. T here is one Temple about three Miles below the City, on the oppofite Side of the | River, called the Fijhes Temple, becaufe annually in the Month of September, when the Floods overflow the low Ground, (as in Egypt) there are good Numbers of Fifties almofl like fmall Salmon, that frequent a Pond clofeof the Eaft Indies. 16$ clofe to that Temple^ and are to be found in no other Place in the Siam Dominions, and they are fo tame, that they will come clofe to our Boats, and frisk and play on the Surface of the Water, if any Body hasaMind to feed them with Bread, Cocoa-nut Meat, or other Food that does not ealily feparate. Tis only to hold fome near the Surface of the Water, and they will take it familiarly from the Hand. I have often taken Pleafure to feed them, and fee them play, but aflbon as we leave off feeding them, they will with draw, fo that hardly one is to be feen till a new Supply of Victuals is offered to them. But none dares offer to take one of them, for fear of raifing a zealous fandified Mob, who punrflHrnall Faults with the greateft Se verities, and thofe Fiihes being confecrated to the God of that Temple, are fecurelypro- teded by the Confecration. They continue about the Temple till the Middle of decern- ber^ that the Floods begin to draw off the Ground, and then they depart, and are feen no where in any River or Pond belonging to Siam, till September brings them back to their Temple. W hatever Animal comes within the Verge of a Temple, it is fecured from Pur- fuit or Violence. I knew a Inha bitant of Siam, who fhot a Crow as it fat on the Branch of a Tree that grew near a Temple, on which the Priefts raifed a Mob, who broke both the poor Man's Legs and Arms, and left him in the Field for dead, L 3 but: 1 -■166 A new Account but fome Chrifttans coming accidentally by, carried him in a Boat, in that deplorable State, to a French Surgeon, who fet his Bones, and cured him. I faw him alive and well in Anno 1710. The French have a Bifliop at Siam, with a Church and a Seminary for the Education of Converts. They Hand a little above the City, on the oppofite Side of the River. They make but few Converts, except when Corn is dear, and then fome of the poorer Sort receive Baptifm, which intitles them to a Maintenance from the Church, but, when Plenty returns, they throw away their Beads and brazen Saint, and bid farewel to Chri- filarnty. In Anno 1720. there were not above feventy Chriftians in and about Siam, and they the mofl dillblut%te7yr'thievifli Rafcals that were to be found in the Country. T he Bilhop was one Mr. Cijfee, a Man of about 80 Years of Age, who, in a Fa mine that happened there in Anno 1708. took ■ up about 3000 Pounds Sterl. from the King, to buy Corn for the Support of his Church, and fuch poor Stamers as were converted by the Necellity of the Times, who relapfed a- gain aflbon as the Famine ceafed, and the poor old Bilhop cannot leave the Country till that Debt be difcharged. He is fuperfti- tioufly zealous for his Religion, and would fain go to Couchtn-china or Tunquin to die a Martyr, becaufe it is Death by their Law to preach any foreign Doftrine without Leave firll obtained from their Kings, What-of the Eaft Indies. 167 Whatever Principles he may have had in Religion I know not, but 1 am lure that he was a diminutive Moralitt, which 1 knew by Experience, in feducing iornc of my bea men, who were black Chrifi'tanSy to lea\ e my Ship at S'tam, contrary to his Promiie, which obliged me to buy Slaves to lup- ply their Places ; but I left him fome Caulc to repent of his Folly and Breach ot 110- mife. r . . T here were four or five Pnefts there befides the Bilhop, one whereof alwavs at tends the College, and the others officiate daily in the Church. They live abftemioul- ly, but, I believe, rather thro' Force than Choice, for their Incomes are very fmall, as Charity and Piety are very cold among then Flock. TTie Tortrigueze have alfo a Church there,* built on the^Side of the River oppo- fite to the lower End of the Town ; but their Priefts are generally fo fcandalous in their Lives, that few frequent their Church, or care for their Converlation. I he Cbtnejfe being very numerous in Suim, have feveral fmalf Temples, but none remarkable for their Stru6lure or Beauty. The 'Butch have a Faftory there, about a Mile below the Town, on the fame Side of the River. Their greateft Inveftments are in Tin, Sapan -wood and Deers Skins, which they buy up for the y upon Market. The Sir am Market takes otf but little Europe an Goods; however the Dutch Chief makes a pretty good Figure there. L 4 Thei(58 A new Account The Engl'tjh, for many Years, had alfo a Faftory there, till about the Year 1686. the Eaft-india Company feeking Occafions to pick a Quarrel with the Stamers, in order to withdraw, they took hold of fuch as they could firfl find, tho' never fo frivolous. The firll was about Anno 1684. The Carolina^ bound from England to China, had the Mif- fortune to lofe her PafTage, and coming to . Siam to pafs away the North-eafl Monfoons, and the King of S'tam having Occafion for fome Stores tor Shipping out of the Caroli na $ Cargo, to equip fome Ships that he had built in order to humble the Cambodians and the Cotichin-chinefe, who difturbed the Navi gation of his Country, he civilly requeued the EngUJh Chief to fupply him at the Pri ces the fame Commodities ufed to be fold at to xMerehanrs, hut lie could not find that Fa vour, which he refented, and threatned to difturb their Commerce. At length theyfup- plicd likn with fome Part of what he deman ded, to avert the ill Confequences that might happen by a total Refufal. This was repre- fented to the Company in the darkeft Co- .0111 s, and they thought that fufficient to ground a War on; but they had, at that lime, a Fleet of large Ships, which they had equipt to regain their Trade .of Ban- tarn and other Places, which the IDutch had mfoiently robbed them of; but they ^^ppointed by the deep Politicks or King L J juries 11. as is before obferved. How-of the Eaft Indies. 160 H o w e v e r, the King of Siam continued his Indulgence to the Company and their Servants, in much Affluence and Luxury, continually caroufing in Debaucheries with Wine and Women, till their common Sala ries and Gains by Trade, were in no Propor tion to their extravagant Expenccs, however that being a free Country, they had Liberty to fpend their own and their Matters Eftates, as they pleafed. The King of Siam having formed the De- fign of a War, as above mentioned, with Cam bodia and Couchin-china, employed a good Number of Englijh who had reforted to ^i- am&gt; to partake of the King's Indulgence and Bounty, and to help the Company's Servants to fpend their Money. All the Englijbwho had a MmcTto lift themfelveson board of his Fleet, had great Encouragement of honour able Pofls and good Salaries well paid, and they did perform Anions in the War wor thy of the Bravery and Courage of the En glijh Nation, by which the King's Favour to the Englijhy increafed more than before the War. O ne Mr. Tots happened to be Chief of the Englijh Fadory at that Time, who by his extravagant Luxury had rioted away a great Part of his Mailers Goods and Money, and had run his own Credit out of Doors. He then began to form Projeds how to clear Accounts with his Mailers and Creditors, without putting any Thing in their Pockets. The firft was on 5-00 Chefls of Japan Copper, whichlyo ne-iso Account which his Matters had in Specie at Sianty and they were brought into Account of Profit and Lofs, for fo much eaten up by the white Ants, which are really Infeds, that by a cold corroding liquid Quality, can do much Mif- chief to Cloth, Timber, or on any other foft Body that their Fluids can penetrate, but Cop er is thought too hard a Morfel for them ; owever, I faw that Article in the Company's Accounts, as they were remitted from Siam to Bombay, and were in Mr. Vaux's Guftody at Surat afterwards. But that fmall Article of ^^co Pounds, went but a fmall Way towards clearing of his Accounts. So after Supper one Night as they were merrily caroufing, the Fa6lory was fet on Fire, and that balanced all other Ac counts. alledged to the King, that his Subjects the Siamers, had done that Mif- chief, and expected the King to be accoun table for LofTes and Damages, fuftained by the Company and their Servants. T he King, on the other hand, proferred to prove, that Mr. ^Pots and his drunken Companions had done it, and that he exped- ed the Company ftiould be accountable to his Subjects for the Lofs they had fuflained by the Fire, which had burnt feveral Houfes that lay near the Faftory. However, the Company adhered to the juft Complaints, of their honeft Servants, and thought that the King's Refufal to make good their Demands, was a fufficient Piece of Ground to build cheir War on. However, the Company con-of the Eaft Indies. 171 fidering that a W ar could bring them no Ad vantage, thought it enough to bully the Sia~ rners, but never declared a War. I n the Year 1685-. the Company fent two Ships to the Bar of Siam. One was the Her bert of 800 Tuns, the other the prudent ry of 400. to frighten the Siamers, but they did no Damage to them, and the Siamers trea ted them civilly. A bout the 1680. there was one Conftan- tine Falcon^ a Greek by Birth, that fome Years before had fhipt himfelf Steward of an En- fi'tjh Ship at London^ bound to India, and eing ordered for Stam, and finding fome ill Treatment onboard, he deferted from the Ship, and fled to a fmall Village fome Di- fiance from the City, where he amufed him felf in learning the Siam Language. He be ing a fober, ingenious, and indunrious Per- fon, foon made himfelf Matter of the Lan guage, and ferved as an Interpreter for the Englijh at Court, where he was remarkably taken Notice of, and got a Poft there. His Behaviour recommended him to greater Pre ferments, fo that in a very few Years he became prime Minifter of State, and behaved him felf fo well in that high Station, that every Thing belonging to the State of the Coun try profpered, fo that Siam became the richelt and powerfulleft Kingdom in that Part of the World. T h e Jefuits hearing that one of the Romijh Communion fat at the Helm of the Siam Af fairs, and it being a rich Country, brought ^ - whole171 A new Account whole Troops of them into Siam, who got the whole Management of Affairs into their Hands, through the Interefl of the Barka- longy that being the Appellation of firft Mi- nifter. They tickled themfelves with the Fancy of bringing the whole Kingdom of i57- am under the Pope's Jurifdidion, and in An- no 1683. the firft Year of his Miniftry, they got the King to fend an Embafly to the King of France, which Ambaflador came alfo to London, and fettled a Treaty of Commerce for the Englijh that fliould trade in Si am, T HEjefuitsimpofed on the King of and made him believe, that if he would fend an EmbafTy to Siam, that King would leave his own Superftition, and embrace theirs. Ac cordingly an AmbafTador was fent, with ma ny valuabhr Itrcncfo Curiofities, and among them a very fine Mafs-book, with beautiful Cuts of all the firfl Rate Saints in the Romijh Kalendar. O n the AmbafTador's Arrival, he was re ceived with the Refpeft due to his Chara- fter, and when the Prefents were laid before the King, according to Cuftom, he feem'd much pleafed with their Curiofity,but when he viewed the Piftures in the Mafs-book, he askt a Jefuit who was Interpreter, what they were, who anfwered, that they were the Pictures of holy Men now in Heaven, and fuch as his Brother the King of France adored, and as he defigned an eternal Friend fliip with his Majefty, he hoped that he would alfo adore thofe Pidures, and worlhip the Images of thofe Saints,of the Eaft Indies. 1^75 Saints, rather than thofe Idols that were wor- fhipped all over his Dominions. The King returned Anfwer, that the Gods of his Coun try had been aufpicious to them who lived in it for Time out of Mind, and as it would be unjuft and ungrateful to banilh thofe Gods that had been fo long very kind to hisPredecef- fors and himfelf, fo he could not turn his old Gods off and take new ones in their Places that he did not fo well know, and that he would oblige his Brother of France in any Thing but that. The King of France complimented Mr. Falcon with the Order of Knighthood, and in his Letter to him, wherein he recommen ded the French Affairs to his Care, particu larly that of Religion, he flil'd him Loving Coufin an^t Counfeller. After the Embafly was gone from S 'tam to France^ the Jefuits thought of nothing but bringing the Trade of diam under the Power of the French, and in order to that, got the King to order the building of a Fort on the River's Side, oppofite to the Fort of Beucock, a Town about ao Leagues below the City of Siam, and to have it mann'd with a Garifon of French, to be paid by the Exche- uer of Siam, and all this was granted accor- ing to their Mind. T he Fort is a regular Tetragon, and can mount about 80 great Guns. When the French got PoileHion they grew intolerably arro gant, which made the Siamers uneafie, and murmured at the King's W eaknefs, but that was174 A new Account was in private, for certain Deftru^ion is the fure Reward of talking publicldy of any Mif- management of the State, for a King of Siam can no more err in Politicks, than a Pope can in Matters of Faith. Y et about the Year 1688.by fome male volent Planet that over-ruled his Aftions, he made a \V ar with his Neighbours the Kings of Cambodia^ and Couchin-china. He fent an Army by JLand, and a Fleet by Sea, to carry on the War, but was not fuccefsful by Land. However in the Land-army there was a mean Perfon, a Citizen of Siam, who kept a Fruit- fhop, he had a bold daring Spirit, and be haved himfelf fo well on all Occafions, in the Land War, that he came to Preferment, and at lall was made Generalillimo, and then ended the War to the Satisfaction of the whole Army abroad, and Ms Prince at home ; but when he brought back the Army to Siam, fee ing the King wrapt up in the Opinion he had of the Jefuits Counfels, and the Management they had in the Affairs of State, by the Coun tenance of the King and his firft Minifter my Lord Falcon^ he pickt a Quarrel with the King, and having moft of the Army at his Devotion, feized his Mafler and put him to Death, after the Manner of royal Criminals, or as Princes of the Blood are treated when convicted of capital Crimes, which is, by put ting them into a large Iron Caldron, and poun ding them to Pieces with wooden Peftles, be- caufe none of their royal Blood muflbe fpilt on the Ground, it being, by their Religion, thoughtof the Eaft Indies. lyj thought great Impiety to contaminate the di vine Blood, by mixing it with Earth. And after he had murdered his Mafter, he fum- moned all the Mundereens in the City, to hold a Council in the Palace. M y Lord Falcon, for that was generally his Defignation, had, by his civil Deportment towards People of all Ranks and Degrees, fo ingratiated himfelf, that he had a ftronger Party by far, both in the City and Country, than the General; and befides, had all the Fleet at his Devotion. Many of my Lord's Friends dilfwaded him from obeying the Sum mons, but to raife the Forces of the City, and .revenge the Death of the King, and many Of ficers of the Army that detefted the Regicide would have come over to his Party, which at leall: was above 5-0000 ftrong, but beingin- fatuate, he was deaf to all good Advice, and went to the Palace, where aflToon as he had fet his Foot, he was feized by the General's Guards, and beheaded, fo the Ufurper took the Sovereignty into his own Hands, and at that Inftant was by jure divino made an in fallible Favourite of Heaven, and the Sun, Moon, and Stars, had the Honour to be his near Relations. H a d my Lord Falcon followed his Friends Advice, or had Courage anfwerable to his o- ther good Qualities, he had certainly been honoured with the Diadem in Siam, and if he had introduced Topery in the Place of Ta- gan'tfm, he had been honoured with a Place in the Pope's Almanack, but his Puilllanimity made him unworthy of both, I Vl t &gt;:I yd A new Account I had this Account from my Lord Secre tary Mr. Baftyfool^hoj on his Mailer's Death, was clapt up in Prifon, and lay three Years with his Neck in the Congoes, which are a Pair of Stocks made of Samboes, and was never taken out, but in order to be feverely whipped, to make him accufe rich Men whom the U- furper had a Mind to deftroy, that he might feize their Eftates under the Umbrage of J u- ftice and Law. Ifaw my Lady Falcon in Anno 1719. and {he was then honoured with the Superinten- dency of his Majeft/s Confedionary. She was born in Siam of honourable Parents, and at that Time much refpeded both in the Court and City, for her Prudence and Hu manity to Natives and Strangers, when they i came into Difficulties, or under the Weight of Opprelfions from fhe Officers of the Court or City. When the Siam AmbaiTador returned from France and England, in the murdered King's Time,hisMafter,among many other Queftions, askt him if the King of France had any Pala ces like his at Siam, for Beauty and Magni tude, and the poor Man unadvifedly told him Truth, that in France were many finer, nay, that the King of France's Horfe Stables in 'Paris, exceeded any Buildingsin/^i^, which his Majefty took lb ill, that he difgrac'd him, and was very near loiing his Head for his tel ling Truth. T h e King of Siam is as fond of lofty Titles as the King of Tegu. Befides his Proximity withof the Eaft Indies. lyy with the heavenly Luminaries, he is a God on Earth, in whofe Court are to be found Juftice, Mercy, and Benevolence to Mankind, with luch a Train of fenfelefs Hyperboles, and at laft, to illuflrate all the reft, he is King of the white Elephant, a Title that none dif- putes with him but the King of Tegu. The King beftows his anniverfary Blefling on his People in the Month of Sept ember ^ when he pafles through the City attended with a numerous Train of Elephants, among whom is the white Elephant, but he is only of a Cream Colour, and I have feen feverals at Bangarie, a Village near Jonkceyloan, as white as him. All the Elephants that Day are dreft in their fineft Trappings, with Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys, and other mufical In- ftruments making a Noife as they go along, but whether it is to divert his Majefty or his Elephants, I know not, but I am fure the Noife was harfli in my Ears. W h i l e he is making his Elephantine Ca valcade through the City, the Populace dares not look him in the Face, but proftrate on their Knees and their Elbows on the Ground, with their Hands open and joyned above their Heads, and their Eyes fixt on the Ground, or fliut till he has paft by them, then they are permitted to rife and look on his back Parts or Side. In the Month of November he alfo (hews himfelf on the River, in a BalLong or Barge of 30 or 40 \ ards long, about two Yards broad, and two Foot deep, with a Throne V ol .

After Sun fets, he embarks again (leaving fome royal Gratuity to the Priefts for their mi raculous Prefent) and is attended in State to his Palace. His Reafon for honouring the River and fiis People that Time of the Year, is to forbid the River formally to flow higher or long- ger than fuch a Number of Inches in Height, or of Days in Time, as he fets k ; yet fometimes it difobeys his royal Com mands.

A.nd I have feen fome pretty agreeable young Gentlewomen with Rottan Marks on their Backs, which they are fo far from covering,' that as they pafs the Streets, they expofe their Backs, tho' their Brealls, Bellies, and Necks are covered with a Scarf, feeming to glory in being fo much taken Notice of by the greatefl King on Earth. The Women in Szam are the only Mer chants in buying Goods, and fome of them trade very confiderably. The Husbands in general are maintained by the Induftry of their Wives. And the Europeans that trade' to S 'tamy accommodate themfelves as they do in Tegu, with temporary Wives, almotf on the fame Conditions too, and it is thought no Difgrace to have had many temporary Husbands, but rather an Honour that they liave been beloved byfo many different Men, The Chrtfllan Priefts cry down that Way of Manning, and want every Heretick, as well as Chrtjitttn Catholick, to be tied to ! fome M 2 voting'180 A nemo Account young Lafles of their bringing up, but the Herericks, according to their innate • Prin ciples, generally continue deaf and obllinate to the grave Advice and found Dodrine of the holy Fathers, and marry according to the Siam Way.

In Anno^ 1717. the King of S'tam made War on his Neighbour of Cambodia^ and invaded Ms Country with an Army of^ooooby Land? and xoooo by Sea, and committed the Care of his Armies to his B ark along, a Chinefe, alto gether unacquainted with War. The China Man accepted of the Charge with much Re- luaancy, but the King would not be denied. The VV ar prov'd unluccefsful, but I'll leave the Particulars till I treat of Cambodia, and re turn to Si am, where I had fome Difficulties to meet with. In Anno 1719. I went thither with a Car go to diipofe on, expefting to trade on the Footing of the old Treaty concluded at Zw/- ^ with the King of England, and the King of Siam s Ambaflador, in Anno 1684. but on my Arrival, I found that Mr. Collet, Gover nor of 1 ort St. George, had cancelled that A- grecment by his Amballador 'Pcjuny, as I have already obferved, and the new Condi- nons being too hard for me to ftand to, Ifo- icited for Liberty to depart again with my Shipma* of the Eaft Indies. 18} Ship and Cargo, which I could not obtain in lefs than four Months. Collefs Attorney at the Court of biam, was a ^PerfiMi by l^irth, but had come to Si* am with his Father when very young, and had remained about 40 \ ears at Sizm. He was as complete a Rafcal as Collet could have found for his villanous Purpofes, for by falfe Informations to the King, he had brought ma ny honeft Men into Trouble, and fome Trea- fure into the King's Coffers. W hen I underftood that he was the Re- mora that had put a Stop to my Commerce, I tried if I could remove him by large Pre- fents, but all to no Purpofe, for if I traded, it muft be on the Scheme laid down by tetchy the Negotiation ofwho kept one CoU'tfon as his Refident at Siam, to con- fult and inform the Terfian of the beft Me thods to ruine the Engli/h Traders that had not Collefs Letters of Protection. This Terjian, (,whole Name was Oia Sen- tier at ) and I, were difcourfing one Day of my Affairs in the Induftan Language, which is the eftabliflied Language fpoken in the Mogul's large Dominions, and, among other Things, I was laying down to him the Diffi culties that might attend the King pf Siam s Trade, carried on from Merjee to Fort St. George, becaufe if therellof the EnglifhCo- lonies were forbid trading with Siam, they had juft Caufe to forbid his Subjects to trade to Fort St. George, or any where elfe, and that other Troubles might arife to the Kings M 4 ' Af -184- A new Account Affairs, by thus impofing on the King, who was ignorant of the Confequences that might follow in breaking the Agreement made in England^ without fo much as once giving Warning to the Engl'tjh Colonies of other Parts of India, H e anfwered me, that the King of Fort St. George could beft give me an Anfwer, who was able to protect the King of Siam\ Trade thither, and that his Majefty had no other foreign Trade but Jafon^ that he valued, and the Englijh had no Trade that Way to di- llurb his Mafter's Commerce, and that if I did not comply with the Agreement made by 'Fowny in Collefs Name, I might go away whtn I could. I told him that I had a Mind to fee the King, and would make him a Prefent of a thoufand Dollars, if he could find Means to introduce me to his Preience.

The Court was held in a large, fquare, oblong Hall, open on all Sides. About Nine the Judge came with fome Thoufands of Attendants, and, as he pafled by me to take his Place, he viewed me very narrowly, as I did him with much Attention. He was a Man of a middle Stature, about 5-0 Years of Age, of a pleafant, but grave Countenance, and had a quick fparkling Eye. He fpoke to my Interpreter, to bid me have a Care of my Tongue, left I fhould prejudice myfelf in anfwering to intricate Queltions. I thank ed him for his Admonition, and told him, IViord to the Wife was fufficient. Having placed himlelf, he ordered my Indi6hnent to be read, which was according ly done, and in about half an Hour's Time it was ended. He a^kt me by my Interpre ter, if I underftood what was libelled againfl me. I anfwered. No. He then bade the In terpreter inform me of the Meaning of each particular Paragraph, as they were read a fe- cond Time with Deliberation, and, having heard my Impeachment, which was ground^ ed only on my faying, That the King had been impofed ufon, I thought fit to deny all, and put my Adverfary Oia Sennerat to prove that I had laid fo; but, by the by, I found, that faying the King of Siam was capable of be ing impofed on, is rank Treafon. T hisI, 186 A new Account The Judge chofe out of the Aflembly two Procurators for each of us, and there were no fmall Debates for three or four Hours, Whether or not a Stranger^ who was ignorant of the Laws of Siam, could come under the Penalty annext to the Traufgrejfion of their Lawsy when they were broken through Igno rance^ and not with 'Defign ; but my An- tagonift at laft carried it in the Affirmative, tho' the Judge feemed to incline towards the Opinions of my Advocates. _ Then the Judge put Oia Sennerat to prove what I was accufed of, and he produced two of his own Servants, who flood at fome Di- fiance when we were difcourfing of my Af fairs ; but my Advocates challenged the Laws of Siam for their Infufficiency, for that Law admits not of a Servant's Teilimony, either for or againft his Mafter. Then he profer- red to bring an undeniable Witnefs againft mc, who was the only Perfon with us when we difcourfed, and that was Collifm^ who was prefently fent for, and being fet by my Adverfary, the Judge askt him by the Inter preter, if he was prefent at fuch a Time, when Oia Sennerat and I were in warm Dif- courfe. He anfwered. He was. He then interrogated him, if he had heard me fay in my Difcourfe, that the King had been impo- fed on. He affirmed he had, on which I perceived a Cloud overfpread the Judge's Countenance, and many others, who had come to hear the Trial, feemed forrowful. Af-of the Eaft Indies. 187 After a little Paufe, the Judge, by the Interpreter, askt me what I had to fay to Col- lifiris Evidence. I anfwered, that I had little Knowledge of him, but that he might be an honeft Man, or otherwife, as his Intereft led him. All continued mute for a little Space, and I broke the Silence by defiring the Judge to ask Collifon in what Language I held that Difcourfe in with Oia Sennerat 9 which the Judge did, and was anfwered, that he did not well know, but that he believed it was in the Induftan Language. I begged the Judge to ask him if he underftood that Lan guage, and he did fo. CoUifon, after fome Paufe, anfwered. No. Then the Judge askt him angrily, and with an Air of Dildain, how he could come in as an Evidence of Words fpoken in a Language that he did not un- derfland, and he fimply faid. That he thought I had faid fo, at which the whole Crowd gave an Huzza, and clapt their Hands, and feemed joyful. The Judge reprimanded Oia Sennerat for putting him and the Court to fo much Trouble, and complimented me on my fafe Delivery, and fo departed fcemingly well fatisfied. I had two Britijh Gentlemen that accom panied me all the Time of my Trial. One was Commander of a fmall Ship from Be7i- £al y called Mr. Alexander Dalglijh^ and one Mr. John Saunders^ who was fecond Super cargo under me; and when the Judge came, fome Executioners followed him with their Inftruments of Death, to put the Sentence in Execu«188 A nena Account Execution aflbon as the Judge pronounces it. Our Debates held fo long, that it was near Eight at Night before we got Home. Had I been caft in my Procefs, my Head had been a Sacrifice to my Adverfary's Refentment, and my Ship and Cargo to the much injured King, and, to fum up all, my Ship's Compa ny had been the King's Slaves. On my re turning Home vidorious, I had the Congra tulations of all my Friends, particularly the Chinefe Merchants, whofe Lives and Ellates might have been endangered by the like vil- lanotis Informations. M y Adverfaries being lhamefully difap- pointed in that Projeft, had one more to try their Skill in, and that was to bring me in for Piracy, for, about four Years before, Mr. Harrifony then Governor of Fort St. George, had fent a Ship to Amoy in Chini, and fome China Merchants having taken Goods and Money, to the Amount of ioooo Tay els, or 6700 Pounds Sterl. when the Term of Payment came, they eloped, and the Super cargoes could have no Redrefs, which made : them give Orders to the Captain of the Ship to make Reprifals, which they did on a large ^onk belonging to the Rarkalong of Slam, k which Jonk they carried with them to Fort 1 St. George, and which Faft my Adverlaries [ fixed on me, tho', at that Time, I was in A- rabia or Terjia, which I proferred to prove by fome Mahometan Merchants that faw me there; but all that I could alledge would have been ineffedual, if I had not accidentallyof the Eaft Indies. 189 found fome Chinefe who belonged to the Jonk when (he was feized, and who knew both me and Captain Jones, who was the Captor, and fo it never came to a Trial. It being high Time for me to get from Stam at any Rate, 1 applied myfelf to my Judge for his Afliftance, and carried a Pre- fent of four Yards of fcarlet Cloth, and fome Pieces of Surat Goods, to the Value of ^o L. in all. He received me very cour- teoufly, and promifed me his Alliftance, but would accept of none of my Prefents. At laft on my preffing him to take it, he accepted of the fcarlet Cloth, but would not touch a- ny of the Surat Goods, tho' they were very fine in their Kind, but recommended me to two Officers more, whom I muft addrefs to make my Requeft be the eafier granted, and he told me, that thofe Surat Goods would ferve to make them my Friends. I took his Advice, and in three Days had my Clearance, for paying about xoo L. for my Ship^ Mea- furage, (an Impofition of Mr. Collefs) and fo I fell down to Bencocky where, according to the Siam Cuftom, I was obliged to put my Guns afhore, before I could go up to the City. I lay there four or five Days be fore Orders were fent to deliver my Guns, which, aflbon as 1 had got on board, and mounted, I told the Orticer that delivered them, to give my Service to Ota Senneraty and tell him, that if the King's three Jonks arrived on this Coaft this Seafon, he would hear farther from me bv them. By190. A new Account; B y that Time I was clear at Bencock, Cap tain c Dalgle'tjh arrived there alfo, in order to proceed to Bengal. He had fallen into the Trap laid by Collet^ and had paid Meafurage and Cuftoms, befides the ufual Prefents to the Court, according to the old Conftitution, but he could not get ready to go fo foon out of the River as I, otherwife I defigned to have brought fome Troubles on Sennerat, if not on Collet and ^Powney^ Affairs at S'tafn^ but Captain Dalglei/h being flill in their Power, tied my Hands. Siam Bar is only a large Bank of foft Mud, and, at Spring-tides, not above ten or eleven Foot Water on it. It is eafy getting into it in the South-weft Monfoons, becaufe, in two or three Tides, with the Motion the Ship receives from the fmall Waves and the i Affiftance of the Wind, fhe Hides thro' the Mud. My Ship drew thirteen Foot, and we had not above nine on the Bar when we went into the River, but coming out with the North-eaft Monfoons, the Sea being fmooth, we are obliged to warp out with An chors and Halfers, and, if the Ship draws any confiderable Draught of Water, we are fome- times two Springs in warping over, but, at twelve Foot Draught, I got over in four Tides. A nd now, having given fome particular Accounts of my Obfervations on and in Si- am, I will alfo give fome general Remarks, and begin with the Fertility of the Country, which, on that Point, is inferior to few (if any) in the World. T hereof the Eaft Indies. 191 T here are but two Parcels of Moun tains to be feen in the Places that I pafled thro*, and they ly between Eaft and North-eaft from the City of Odta, about ten Leagues diftant, and they produce good Timber for building, and Agala-wood for Perfumes. They have alio Mines of Iron, Tin, Lead, Silver and Gold, but they are all entailed on the Crown, who has the fole Benefit of them. They breed vaft Numbers of wild Deer, which are hunted and killed for the fake of their Skins, which they yearly fend to Jafon. The Plains produce all Sorts of Grain ne- cefiary for animal and human Suftenance. They plentifully bear as good, if not the beft Oranges, Lemons and Limes in the World. Their Rivers fuperabound in Filh of feveral Species, very good in their Kind. Their Vil lages are numerous, and well inhabited with Artificers and Peafants; but there are but five walled Towns in all the S'tam Domini ons, and Odin is one of them. T hey have Abundance of wild Animals in their Woods, fuch as Elephants, Rhinoce- rofes, Leopards and Tigers, and tame Cattle, as Bullocks, Buffaloes and Swine, in Abun dance about their Farms. Temples andPriefts are more numerous here, in Proportion to the Laity, than in any Country I ever faw out of the Dominions of Tor tit gal. Their Tallapoys or Priefts are diftinguilhed from the Laity by a cinnamon or orange-coloured Cloke which they wear, they again differing among themfelves by diflinguilhing Badges, by191 A nm Account by which they know their Degree and Dig nity. Their Heads, Beards and Eye-brows are kept clofe fliaven. They are forbidden Marriage or meddling with Money, and if any of the Prieflhood is convided of Incon- tinency with Women, he is burned for it a- live, and, if only fufpefted and brought to a Trial, he is degraded and banifhed. They have Sermons or Ledures four Times in a Moon, the Gates of the Tem ples being fet wide open, and the People meet in good Order. Their Sermons con- fift in recommending moral Duties to the People, and Charity towards one another, but particularly to the Church, by which Ads it fubfifts; and, after the Priefts Bene- diftion, every one goes to an Image, and kif- fes it, or bows to it, and marches off in good Order. They^ have Morning and Evening Prayers, and ling Anthems. They vifit the Sick, and pray for the Dead, and accompa ny the Corps to the funeral Pile, and fing Obfequies. They go to Weddings, and make Sacrifices for the Profperity of the Bride groom and Bride, but have no Hand in joyn- ing them together. M arriages are there made up by Parents or near Relations, without the Con- fent of the Parties to be married, for that Reafon they are commonly married very young; bur, if they are come to the Years of Difcretion or Maturity, then the Spark gets fome female Friend to acquaint his Mi- Itris with his Paflion for her, and if ihe will per-of the Eaft Indies. 195 permit a Vilit from him, the Bargain is as good as made. The civil MagHlrate with them officiates the Prieft's Part with us, and when once they are married, they feldom fue for a Divorce, which is very hard to pro cure, except in Cafe of Infufficiency in the Man, or Barrennefs in the Woman, for dultery, in either Party, is not reckoned infa mous; and Fornication is either allowed or tolerated. The Children are carefully educated in Schools by Prietis fet apart for that Service, and it is rare to find a Stamer but who can write. After Schooling, they are put to fuch Callings as fuit beft with their Genius and Quality : And there is generally a reciprocal Harmony between Parents and Children. The Children are obedient, and the Parent indulgent. In Childhood and Youth the Pa rent farniflies the Child w 7 ith what is neceP- fary, and in old Age the Child fupplies all the Wants of his Parent, as far as he is able. In Marriages they make no Account of Con* fanguinity, farther than between Father and Daughter, Mother and Son, and Sifter and Brother; all other Degrees are lawful. A nd now it is Time to fleer my Courfe to the Southward again as far as Cambodia, Coafling along Shore, the firfl Place we meet with is Bankafoy, a Place not frequented by Strangers, tho' it produces much Agala and Sapan-woods, and Elephants Teeth; but all are fent to the King, who, for all his gaudy Titles, yet iloops to play the Merchant. 1 V ol. I!. N fup-I o^. A new Account fuppofe he makes Ufe of Trading in Honour of his Kinfman Mercury^ who fuperintends Merchandizing, but was never reckoned a fair Dealer, and in that Point the King is nearly related to him: But Bankafoy is fa mous, chiefly for making Ballichang, a Sauce made of dried Shrimps, Cod-pepper, Salt and a Sea Weed or Grafs, all well mixed, and beaten up to the Confiftency of thick Mu- flard. Its Tafte and Smell are both ungrate ful to the Nofe and Palate; but many Hun dred Tuns are expended in Siam and the adjacent Countries, Bankafoy River lies but 4 or 5* Leagues to the Eaftward of Siam Bar, and there are two Iflands, called the 'Dutch Illands, where great Ships are obliged to flay in the South- wefl Monfoons, when they cannot get Wa ter over the Bar that bears off it South-eafi and by South, about nine Leagues diflant. I obferved before, that the Company fent the Herbert and another Ship from England in Anno 1685*. and in 1686. as the Herbert lay at thofe Illands, one Captain 'Udal, who commanded her, died, and the fucceeding Captain carried his Corps afhore, and buried it in a pretty deep Grave. Two Days after, fome of the Ship's People going afhore, had the Curiofity to go and fee the Grave. When they came near, to their great Wonder, they faw the Corps flript of its winding Sheet, and fet upright againft a Tree. It was after wards put again into the Coffin, and buried in the fame Grave, with a Quantity of heavy Stonesof the Eaft Indies. iqj Stones on it, and next Day they came to the Grave, and found it opened a fecond Time with the Corps ftanding upright againft ano ther I ree, lo they made faft fome Stones to K, and carried it a pretty Way into the Sea and buried it in the Water, where it remain ed undifturbed. This ftrange Refurredion left Room tor various Conjedbres, but the moft probable feemed to be, that fome Sor cerers took it up, and put it in that Pofture whilft they, by their Sorceries or Incantatt' ons, interrogate it about future Events, and received Anfwers thro' human Organs. The Matter of Fad I have heard often affirmed by feverals who were there at the Time and law it, which made me enquire, if any Peo ple in Stam ufed to enquire about future E- vents after that Manner, and I was told that tney did. Phe Coafls or lAatnpe and Qhiampo are the Territories of Siam, but for yo Leagues and more along the Sea-ihore, there art no Sea-ports, the Country being almoft a De- lert.

Gives an Account Cambodia its Trade^ al- fo of a late JVar brought into their Country by the Siamer, and the ill Succefs they had. TH E firft Sea-port to be met with is Cupangfoap, a Town in the Domini- nions of Cambodia. It affords Elephants Teeth, Sticklack and the Gum Cambouge or Cambodia ; but there is no free Commerce al lowed there, without a Licence from the Court of Cambodia. . The next Place is ^Ponteamafs, a Place of pretty good Trade for many Years, having the Conveniency of a pretty deep but nar row River, which, in the rainy Seafonsof the South-weft Monfoons, has Communication with Banfack or Cambodia River, which Con veniency made it draw foreign Commerce from the City of Cambodia hither; for the City lying near 100 Leagues up the River, and moft Part of the Way a continual Stream running downward, made the Navigation to the City fo long and troublefom, that few cared to trade to it, for which Reafons fo reign Commerce chofe to come to Touted- inafii and it flourifhed pretty well till the Year 1717. that the Siam Fleet deftroyed it. W hen the Siam Army and Fleet threat- ned Cambodia, the King knew his Inability to withftand the Siamers, fo the Inhabitants that lived on his Borders had Orders to remove towards the City of Cambodia, and what they couldof the Eaft Indies. i could not bring with them, to deflroy it, fo that for fifty Leagues the Country was a mere Defert. He then addreft the King of Couchln-china for Alliftance and Prote6Hon, which he obtained, on Condition, that Cam bodia fliould become tributary to Conchin- china, which was agreed to, and he had an Army of 15-000 to a (Tift him by Land, and 3000 in nimble Gallies well mann'd and e- quipt, by Sea. The S/tfwArmy by Land was above dolible the Number of the Cambodians and Coucbin- chinefe in Conjundion, and their Fleet above four Times their Number. The Land Army finding all the Country defolate, as they mar ched into the Borders of Cambodia, foon be gan to be in Dillrefs for Want of Provifi- ons, which obliged them to kill their Carri age Beafts, and their Elephants and Horfes which they could get no Sullenance for, and the Soldiers being obliged to eat their Flelh, it being a Diet they had never been ufed to, an epidemick Flux and Fever feized the whole Army, fo that in two Months one Half was not left, and thofe were obliged to retreat towards their own Country again, with the Cambodian Army always at their Heels. Nor had their Navy much better Succefs, for they coming to Tonteamafs, fent in their Imall Gallics to plunder and burn the Town, which they did etfequally, and, of Elephants Teeth only, they burnt above ico Tuns. The ^hips and ^Jonks of Burden lying in the N 3 Road,198 A mw Account Road, above four Miles from the Town, the Couchin-chlnefe taking hold of that Opportu nity, attackt the large VelTels, and burned fome, and forced others afhore, whilft their Gallies were in a narrow River, and could not come to their Ailiftance till High-water that they could get out. The Couchin-chinefe having done what they came for, retired, not caring to engage fuch a fuperior Number, and the Stamers fearing Famine in their Fleet, fteered their Courfe for Siam with Difgrace. In Anno 1720. I faw feveral of the Wracks, and the Ruins of the Town of^«- teamafs. The City of Cambodia (lands on the Side of the great River, about 50 or 60 Leagues from Tonteamafs by Land, or by Water in the South-well Monfoons. The Country produces Gold of twenty one Caraffs fine, raw Silk at izo Dollars J&gt;er 'Fecul, Elephants Teeth at 50 to 55 Dollars for the largeft. The fmall arc of different Prices. They have alfo much Sapan-wood, Sandal-wood, Agala- wood, Sticklack, and many Sorts of phyfical Drugs, and Lack for Japaning. They are ve ry defirous of having a Trade with the Eng~ lifly; but they will not fuffer the Dutch to fettle Fadories in their Country. P rovisions of Flefh and Fifti are plen tiful and cheap, and are the only Things that may be bought without a Permit from the King. I have bought a Bullock, that weigh ed between 4 and ^oo Weight, for a Spamjh Dollar; and Rice is bought at Eight Pence perof the Eaft Indies. 199 per ^Pecul, which is about 140 lb. but Poul try are fcarce, becaufe the Country being for the moft Part woody, when the Chickens grow big, they go to the Woods, and ihift for themfelves. Tigers and wild Llephants are numerous in the Woods, and there are alfo wild Cattle and Buffaloes, and Plenty of Deer, all which Animals every Body is tree to catch or kill. There are about two hundred Topajfcsy or Indian 'Fortugueze fettled and married in Cambodia^ and fome of them have pretty good Polls in the Government, and live great after the Fafhion of that Country ; but they have no Priells, nor will any venture to go among them, for tn Anno 1710. a poor Capuchin went there to officiate, and finding one of the toppingefl of his Congregation to have two Wives, ordered him, by virtue of his facerdotal Power, to put one of them away, but his Pariflioner would not obey in that Point, which made the Prieft ule the Wea pon of Excommunication againil him, which the other took in fuch Dudgeon, that he knockt his fpiritual Guide's Brains out for his unfealbnable Severity. Since that Time they wrote to Siatn and Macao in China for fome more ghoftly Fathers, but not one will go, tho' perhaps they might have the Honour of dying Martyrs. T hey all of them have fmall Penfions from the King, but too narrow to maintain them, fo they go to the Woods with Fire arms, and kill wild Elephants for their Teeth, N 4 ~ whichZOO A new Account which they fell to Foreigners ; and their I Way of killing them is very fingular, for ' they form a Piece of Iron like a Slug, and the foremofl End is made lharp. In the Woods grow certain Trees with a thick Bark of a violent poifonous Quality. They drive the fharp End of the Slug into the Bark, and let it flay a Ihort Time in it, then put the Slug into their Gun charged with Powder, and coming near the Beaft, fire the Slug into its Body. The Elephant being thus wounded, flees from the Man, but the Man keeps Sight of it for a fmall Space of Time, and then it drops down dead. And with the fame poifoned Slugs they kill Cattle and Buffaloes, for their Tongues. This fubtil Poifon has alfo another ftrange Quality, that if Men become hungry or thir ty, (as they often do in the Woods) they fqueeze a few Drops of it on a Leaf of a Tree, and they licking the Leaf, it gives im mediate Refrefliment ; but if the Skin be broken, and the Juice touch the Part, it proves mortal without Remedy. W hen I arrived at TonteamaJs^nOfficex came on board, who could fpeak a little tugueze. He brought a Prcfent of Refreih- ments along with him, and advifed me to fend to the King, to give him an Account of my Arrival, and acquaint him that I defign- ed to trade with his Subjefts by his Permiffi^ on, which I did, and in twelve Days, receiv ed an Anfwer that I might, but defired me to fend fome Perfonup with Mufters of my Goodsjof the Eaft Indies. ZOI ieir Goods, that he and his Merchants might fee for them, and fent two Tortugueze for Interpre- and ters, one to ftay with me on board of my Ship, the while I (laid, and the other to accompany the lick Perfon I defigned to fend to him with the hey Mufters. On their Arrival I difpatcht my the fecond Supercargo, with an Equippage of xs ben Men, well armed with Fuzees and Bayonets, ^ith with two fmall Bales of Mufters, and Pre- fire fents for the King, with Inftrudions to let me ing hear from him once a Week by an Exprefs, the if no other Opportunity offered, of A f t e r he arrived at the City, he had a large Houfe allowed him for the Accom- icy modation of him and his Retinue, and had les. ilore of Provifions fent him, and many Folks ige of Diflinftion vifited him, but ten Days part lir- before he could fee his Majeity, who at lall ley received him in great State, fitting on a ' a Throne like a Pulpit, with his Face vailed m- below his Eyes, and after many gracious be Speeches, fome whereof were pertinent to it my Purpofe, but many not, he gave me Li berty and Encouragement to trade. :er I had ilaid above three Weeks in Expe61a- 9r- tion to hear from my fecond Supercargo, but fli- could get no Account from him. I begin- to ning to be unealie, got an Exprefs to carry of Letters to him, and ordered him to fend it ; n - back with as much Speed as was podible, but fi- had the Mortification to find he had been ftopt v- at the City. I was extremely uneafie for Qe want of Advice what was become of my ly People, and the approaching of the South- Is, weftzoi A new Account well Monfoons, which would have made that Coaft a Lee-ftiore, and would have oblig'd me to take Sanduary in one of their Harbours for five or fix Months, and was not certain whether I was in a Friend's or an Enemy's Country. In this Labyrinth I continued a Week, and at laft refolved to depart by a cer tain Day, and leave my People to come af ter me to Malacca^ if they were alive and at Liberty. The Goods I hadfent up with them, would have been fufficient to have hired a VeflTel to carry them thither. I told my Re- folution to my Interpreter, and that I fhould be obliged to carry him and fome more of the King's Subjeds along with me as Hofta- gesfor the civil Treatment of my People at Cambodia, He feemed furprifed at my Re- folution, and got a Perfon to go to the City in all Hafte to give an Account of my Impa tience and Defign, who returned in fourteen Days, about two Days before my Term was expired, that I had fet for my Departure. There accompanied him three Tortugueze, who brought me Letters from my lecond Supercargo, that he had taken Leave of the King, and was coming to me with all Halle, and in three Days after the Tortugueze cxmzy he arrived with all his Retinue, with a Let ter of Compliment to me in the Tortugueze Language, and one direded to the Gover nor of Bombay, to invite the Englljh to fettle in his Country, and to build Fadories or Forts in any Part of his Dominions to proted Trade. T heof the Eaft Indies. 105 The Reafon why he kept us fo long in Sufpence, was, that he would enter into no Correfpondence with us without the Know ledge and Confent of his Guardian the King of Couchtn-cbitia, who at laft confented to allow us Commerce both in Cambodia^ and in his own proper Dominions, but that the Sla- mers had deftroyed the Country where they had been, and they had nothing ready 101 Barter with my Cargo then, but in a Ycai 01 two they would be provided. When the King beflows his Favour on any Perfon whom he has a Mind to honour, which he never does without a confidcrablc Prefent, he prefents the Perfon with two Swords to be carried always before him when he goes abroad in publick, one is the Svvoi d of State, and the other of Juftice. All People that meet him when thofe Swords are carried before him, mud give him Place, and falute him by a fettorm ot Words,but it he meets with another Court IVlinion, then they com pare the Dates of their Patents, and Segnio- rity takes Place, and muft be fir 11 faluted. Wherever thole fylAnduvectis go in the Coun try, they hold Courts ot jullice, both civil and criminal, and they have the Power ot laying on Fines, but they are paid into the King's Treafury ; but in capital Crin /cs, his Sentence is Law, and fpeedy Execution fol lows Sentence. The Qambodtuns are of a light brown Com plexion, and very well fliap'd, their Hair long, and Beards thin. Their Women are very hand- fom, r2,04 A new Account fom, but not very modeft. The Men wear a Veflment like our Night-gowns, but no^ thing on their Heads or Feet. The Women wear a Petticoat reaching below the Ancle, and on their Bodies a Frock made clofe and meet for their Bodies and Arms, and both Sexes drefs their Hair. I faw none of their Priefts, but underftood from my Interpreter, that they worlhip the fame Gods that are adored in S'tam, They i worfhip the great God under the Name of t Tipedah) and 'Praw 'Prumb, and Traw c Pouty are his Sons. The Church fubfifts by Free will-offerings, and their Priefts are not much refpefted, being generally chofen from a- mong the lower Sort of the Laity. The Kingdom of Laos borders on Siam, Cambodia, Couchhi-cbina, and Tonquin. It pro duces Gold, raw Silk, and Elephants Teeth are fo plentiful, that they flake their Fields and Gardens about with them, to keep out wild Hogs and Cattle from deftroying their Fruit and Corn. I hey are all in Religion. The Natives of Laos are whiter in Com plexion than their circumjacent Neighbours. I faw fome of them at Siam, of both Sexes. I heir Women were little inferior to Tortu- gueze or Spantjh Ladies. There arefeveral Illands that ly off the Coaft of Cambodia, but none are inhabited, becaufe the Saleeters, or Pirates that infell: that Coaft, rob them of what they get by Pains and Induftry, tho' there is one about three Leagues Weft of Tonteamafs, called Qud'of the Eaft Indies. z 05 Quadroly that has good Qualifications for a Settlement. It is about three Leagues long, and one broad. Wood and frefli Water are plentiful, the Ground of a moderate Height, the Soil black and fat, except along the Laft Side which faces Tonteamafs^ and that has feveral fine fandy Bays, and they are good fafe Harbours in the rainy and windy Sea- fons. About 30 Leagues Eaft-fouth-eaft from c Ponteamafsy is the W eft Entrance of Cambo dia River, generally called Bocca de Caran- gera. The ihalloweft Place in the Chanel in going in, is four Fathoms, and within it deep ens to Twenty in fome Places. The North Entrance is broader, but much lhallower,and lies about ten Leagues diftantfrom the Weft Chanel, but is little frequented. Between Tonteamafs and the River, are feveral fmall uninhabited Iflands. 'Putlo-fanjang is the largeft, and confifts of a Clufter of eight Iflands, which form a pretty good Harbour. Tullo- iihi is the Eaftmoft, and affords good Mafts for Shipping. Tullo-condore is the largeft and higheft, compofed of four or five Iflands.

H erm ■ 106 A new Account He made a bad Choice of a Place for a Colony, that Ifland producing nothing but Wood, Water, and Fifh for catching. He got lome jMaccafJeys to fcrve for Soldiers and help to build a Fortification, and made a firm Contract with them to difcharge them at the End of three Years if they were min ded to quit his Service, but did not perform what was contrafted, which was the Caufe of his own Ruin, and the Lofs of the Colony, joi thole Eaitern Defperadoes are veryfaith- where Contrads and Covenants are duly obferved when made with them, but in De- taihance, they are revengeful and cruel. Mr Ketchpole haying detained the Maccajfers be yond their Time of Agreement, ftill entrufted them with the Guard of his own Perfonand the Ganfon, and they taking the Oppor tunity of the Night, when all the Enghjh were in their Jkds, who lodged in the Fort, thev inhumanely murdered them all. There was lome Noife made by thofe who were awake which a few who lodged without the 1; on, hearing, took the Alarm, and ran to the ^ ca bide, where kind Providence direded them to a Boat ready fitted with Oars and bails, which they imbarked in, and put off e Shore ' and were not a Stone's-throw oft, till the bloody Villains on the Shore were in Queft of them. So thofe in the Boat, with much fatigue, Hunger, and Thirf! in failing, and rowing above 100 Leagues, got to fome i 'lee of the King of J chores Dominions, where they were treated with Humanity.

There were two Harbours, or anchoring Places, at Tullo-condore, but neither of them good. One at the North-eaft End, they were forced to ufe in the South-weft Monfoons, the other on the Weft-fide for the North- eaft Winds, the Bottom of which is rocky, and therefore dangerous for lofing Anchors and Cables, yet that was the Place chofen to build rtieir Fort on, but fince aFadory was thought neceflary to be fettled on that Coaft, I wonder why they chofe thefe Iflands, ra ther than Quadrole which I mentioned be fore.

It is a Country far larger than Cambodia, and much richer, and the Inhabitants more couragious and hardier for enduring Fatigues in Labour or War, than the Cambodians, but are not fo converfable and civil to Strangers. The Cou- chin-chinefe draw one Half of the Culloms and Taxes raifed in Cambodiahy Commerce and Merchandizing, but they give little En couragement for Strangers to trade with them. Their Country abounding in Gold, raw Silk, and Drugs, they bring them to Cambodia, to difpofe of there, except what | they fend yearly to Canton in China ; and I | have feen fome of their Jonks trading at Jo- ! bore and Batavia. Their Religion is Tagan after the China Way, worlhipping the lame Gods, after the s fame Manner as the Chinefe do. Their Laws | are f^vere and bloody for Crimes of Treafon, ■ for not only the guilty Perfon fuffers a pain- j ful Death, but the Relations within the Bounds of Confanguinity fuffer Death alio. Their Cities and Towns are divided into Ward- fhips, and at the Ends of each Street are rail ed Gates, placed to confine each Ward with in its own Limits. Thefe Gates are fhut and locktof the Eaft Indies. zop lockt every Night, fo that they have no Com munication by Night, but if a Fire breaks out in one of the Wards, its whole Inhabi tants are cut off except the Women and Children. There are but few Chriflians tolerated in Couchin-china, yet there was (andperhaps is) a French Pried in great Efteem among them, but it is capital for any other Prieft to be found in their Country. This French Man kept a Correfpondence by writing, with Mr. C'tJ Tic Bifhop of S'tam^ and he having a Relation of the Danger Chriftian Prieils were in there, made the old Zealot half-mad to get thither, to receive the Honour of Mar tyrdom, and had he been honeft in his Pro- mifes to me (which was only not to proteft any of my fugitive Seamen at S'tam) I would have favoured him with a PafTage to Cambo- dia^rom whence he might have eafily gone to get that glorious Crown. Couchin-china has a large Sea-coafl of about 700 Miles in Extent, from the River of Cam bodia, to that of Gyuambin, and it has the Con- veniency of many good Harbours on it, tho' they are not frequented by Strangers; and along the Eaft Coaft it is very deep, for in feveral Places I founded the Depth, and found between 60 and 80 Fathoms within Half a League of the Shore. There are feveral Iflands on this Coaft. Thofe neareft the Shore are not dangerous. Tullo-fecca de terra, lies moft Southerly, and neareft the Shore. It is uninhabited, and looks V ol. II.

There are ftrong Currents that run to the South ward in the North-eaft Monfoons, which makes Pilots take Care to keep near the Qou- chin-china Coaft, for fear of being driven a- mong the Taracels, which are a dangerous Chain of Rocks, about 130 Leagues long, and about 15 broad, and have only fome I- (lands at each End. There are feveral In ter-currents among thofe Rocks, but no known Marks to keep clear of Dangers by, | yet I knew an Englifh Ship from Surat^ that drove accidentally through them, and neither knew nor faw their Danger till it was over, when they unexpectedly faw the Coaft of Q q nchin-chin a. In Anno 1690. a Tortugueze Ship was loft on one of the Northermoft Illancls of the tParacels, and all were loft but three or four Perfons who fwimm'd afhore. There were t many Pieces of the Wrack followed them, and fome Canifters of Flour were accidentally thrown aftiore, whereby they were fupported.of the Eaft Indies. lit They built an Hut of what Timbers and Boards they could ufe for that Purpofe, and they found fome frefli Water in the Caverns of the Roclvs, and in one Place they built a Ciftern to fave the Rain Water for the dry Seafon. They took Sea Weeds and mixt with Mud that they found about the Coaft of the Ifland, and placing that Mixture in a con venient Part to retain the Rain Water, they fubfifted by that Means a dry Seafon* Their Food was Sea Fowls, and Tortoifes which frequented that Ifland in great Num bers. In three Years they all died but one, and in Anno 1701. a Ship bound to Maccao, coming near the Ifland againft their Will, feeing the Figure of a Man waving his Hands over his Head, they had Compaffion and fent their Boat to the Ifland, and were afto- niftied to find the Perfon to be one of their own Country Men, and much more when he told them his Misfortunes, and how long he had been alone on that Ifland. Theyolothed him and fed him, and carried him to Mac- cao, where I fawhim in Anno 1703. and had the Account from his own Mouth. B u t it is Time to return back to Couchin- china, which about three or four Centuries ago, was but a Province of Tonojuin t at leall they were both under the Dominion of one King, who dying without Ifllie, divided the Government of his Dominions between a Brother and a Siller of his, whom he very much efteem'd for their good Qualities. He ordered his Brother to relide in Couch'm-chi~ O x na*Ill A new Account na, and take Care of Affairs there, while the Siller took Care of the Government of Ton- quin^ but to have a Meeting once a Year to confider and confult of Matters for the Good of the State. The Lady being young, thought fit to marry, and the Harmony of State foon end ed by the Marriage. The Husband grew ambitious, and wanted the Government whol ly in his own Hands, but carried fair with his Brother in Law, and one Time talking witli the Queen of the NecefTity of uniting botli Kingdoms into one, as formerly, and that of Right both belonged to her, as being poflell, of the moft ancient and noble Kingdom, and that in order to get both Kingdoms into her Hands, he would find a Way to cut off her Brother, without Sufpicion of their being ac- celTory to it. The Queen feeming to ap. prove of the Defign, privately let her Brother know his Danger; being then at the Court of ToHquin, Ihe advifed him to pretend to go a hunting for a few Days, but to make what Halle he could unto his own Government, where he might be fecure from Confpiracies on his Life, which Advice he followed, and gotfafe into Couchin-china, and calling a Coun cil of his Nobles, related the whole Affair to them. I h e Couchin-chtnefe took the defigned In jury to their Prince, fo ill, that from that^ Time they renounced all Friendfhip and Com merce w 7 ith the TonquinerS) and the River ( Quamb'm being made the Bounds of Tonquin Do- iof the Eaft Indies, z 15 Dominions to the Southward, and of Qouch 'm- china to the Northward, they both raifed Ar mies of 40 or 50000 Men each, and they con tinue llill facing one another, the River ly ing between them, and nothing of Aftion has happened all this while. If any Couchin- chinefe happens to flee from the Juftice of his own Country, to the Tonqutners, they re ceive him kindly, and treat him civilly, but if a Tonquiner fall under the fame Circum- ftances, and go for Sanfluary to the Coucbin- chinefe^ he is condemned to Slavery, and fo muft continue till he gets a Pardon from his own Court, and pay his Ranfom. Tonquin is the next Kingdom I mud fteer to of Courfe, where the Englifl) and Dutch both had their Fa6lories, but the Englijh Company's Affairs being a little out of Order, they withdrew theirs in January 1698. and the Dutch finding but little Advantage by their Trade in Tonquin, withdrew theirs a- bout fix Years after. However, xhzEn^UJh had a private Trade pretty good till the Year i7i9.thatan Englijh Ship from Bengalx\x\x\&amp; it by an Aft of Violence. T he Ship being laden and ready to fail, fell down the River from Catchco the capital City of Tonquin^n^ in Defiance to the known Laws of the Country, the Supercargo got a Tonquin Girl on board, in order to carry her with him, but her Friends miffing her, infor med the civil Magiflrate, who fent to demand her, but the Supercargo would not refign his Miftris, whereupon Ads of Hoftility enfued, O 3 andA new A atid fomc were killed on both Sides, and Cap tain IVallace who commanded the Ship, had the Fortune to be one of the flain, however, the Englijh bravely carried off their Prize, but I never heard any more of the Tonquin Trade fince. Tonquin is bounded with Con chin-chin a on the South, Laos on the Weft, Qiianji a Pro vince of China on the North, ancl the Ocean on the Eaft. The Country is prodigioully fruitful in all Things neceffary for the Conve- j niency and Support of Life. It produces Gold and Copper, but neither of them fine. They have Abundance of raw Silk, and manufadure Part of it in wrought Silks, but none fine. Their ^^isthebeft, which they generally dye black. It wears very long, becaufe it is foft and well fpun, and the oftner it is waflied, the Colour looks brighter, if blacker may be fo called. They make Bowls, Cups, and Tables, of Rottans, and cover them very neatly with Lack of I divers Colours, and gild them. They have alfo fome c Porcelline. but very coarfe and ill painted. And thofeare the Commodities for Exportation from Tonquin. T here is a great Chain of impalTable Mountains that run from the Sea above 150 Leagues, along the Confines of Qnanfi and Qui chew. Provinces of China, which fecure Tonquin from any Invafions that may come that Way from China, and thofe Mountains are covered with thick Woods well ftockt with wild Elephants, Tigers, and Deer, but theof the Eaft Indies. II5 the Ufe or Oftentation of training up tame Elephants, is not much minded in Tonquin, nor in China. The Religion isflridly forbiden to be preacht in Tonquin, yet there are fome Chrifiians of the Romtjh Church there. Their own Religion is Tagan, according to the Do- drine of China. And they have a Tradition, that many Ages ago, Tonquin and Cotichin- china were both Provinces of China. The Tonquiners ufed to be very defirous of having a Brood of Europeans in their Coun try, for which Reafon the greateft Nobles thought it no Shame or Dilgrace to marry their Daughters to Englijh and Seamen, for the Time they were to ftay in Tonquin, and often prelented their Sons in Law pretty hand- fomly at their Departure, efpecially if they left their Wives withChild,but Adultery was dangerous to the Husband, for they are well verled in the Art of poifoning. The Men and Women are both well fliap'd, and tolerably beautiful, but of a low Stature. The Maids keep their Teeth very white, till they have loft the blue of their Plumb, and then they dye them as black as jet, with the Juice of a certain Herb which they hold in their Mouths for three Days fuc- cellively, and the black Tindure continues ever after ; but while that Juice is in their Mouths, they dare not fwallow their Spittle, it being of a poifonous Quality. 04 C hap.bsbbhhmhh Mm Zi6 A new Account CHAP.

THE Ifland oiAynam lies in the Bay of Tonquin, and not above iz Leagues di- ftant from its Northern Confines. The Ifland is large, being about 180 Miles in Length, and 120 in Breadth. It was formerly under quin, but at prefent a Part of the Dominions of China. Its greateft Produft is Salt, and is not frequented on account of Trade. There is noPaflage for Veffels of Burden, between it and the Continent, being fo full of dange rous Banks and rapid Currents. The mid Lands feem very mountainous. The Eaft and South Sides are low, but clear of Danger. About two Leagues from its Shores, is from 10 to if Fathoms Water. The next Courfe I (leer, is into Quanfi, the Southermoll Province of China, and as yet has not been brought to acknowledge the Tartar Domination. It admits of no Com merce either with Foreigners or Chinefe, that are under the Tartar Government, but on all Occalions commit Ads of Hoftility on them, and are fo bold and couragious, that one of their little Gallies will attack four of the Emperor's, and rpake them flee before them, for thev give Quarter to none that bear Arms under the Tartar Prince, as they callof the Eaft Indies. ny call the Emperor. The Country is fruitful and populous, and produces much raw Silk and Drugs, fuch as China Root, Gallingal, &amp;c. It has 80 Leagues of aSea-coaft, and is boun ded by the L^^f^Illands 3 and Canton River. Canton or Quantung (as the Chinefe ex- prefs it) is the next maritim Province; and Maccaw y a City built by the Tortugueze* was the firft Place of Commerce. This City {lands on a fmall Illand, and is al- mofl furrounded by the Sea. Towards the Land it is defended by three Caftles built on the Tops of low Hills. By its Situation and Strength by Nature and Art, it was once thought impregnable. Indeed their beautiful Churches and other Buildings give us a re- flefting Idea of its ancient Grandeur, for in the Forepart of the feventeenth Century, ac cording to the Chrijiian A^ra^ it was the greateil Port for Trade in India or China. The largeft Brafs Cannon th^t ever I faw are mounted in proper Batteries about the City. I meafured one (amongft many) out of Curiofity, and found it 23 Foot from the Breech to the Muzzle Ring, nine Inches and a Quarter diameter in the Bore, and it was izzfo Rotullaes or lb. Weight of folid Metal. The City contains five Churches, but the Jefuits is the beft, and is dedicated to St. Paul. It has two Convents for married Wo- men to retire to, when their Husbands are ab- fent,and orphan Maidens are educated in them till they can catch an Husband. They have alfo a Gunnery for devout Ladies, young orZi8 A new Account old, that are out of Conceit with the Trou bles and Cares of the World. And they have a Santta Cafa or the holy Houfe of the Inquifition, that frightens every Catholick in to the Belief of every Thing that holy Mo ther Church tells them is Truth, whether it be really fo or no. The Forts are governed by a Captain-ge neral, and the City by a Burgher, called the c Procuradore, but, in Reality, both are go verned by a Chinefe Munder een^ who re fides about a League out of the City, at a Place called Cafa Branca. The 'portugueze Ship ping that come there, are admitted into their Harbour, and are under the Proteftion of the Town; but the Chine fe keep the Cu- ftom-houfe, and receive Cuftoms for all Goods imported. That rich flourifliing City has ruined it- felf by a long War they made with Timore % as I have obferved before. They exhaufled their Men and Money on that unfuccefsful Project of Domination, fo that out ofaThou- fand creditable Houfe-keepers that inhabited the City before that War, there are hardly fifty left; and out of forty Sail of trading Veflels, they have not above five left, fo that in the whole City and Forts, there are computed to be about two hundred Laity, and fix hundred Priefls, and about fifteen hundred Women, and many of them are very prolifick, for they bring forth Children -without Husbands to father them, ^ J*of the Eaft Indies. 119 In Anno 1703. I was bound from Surat to Amoy -i and off the Maccoa Iflands, in the Month of Auguft, I met with a fevere Huri- ricane. We had vifible Signs of an approach ing Storm before it came, the Air was in great Agitation by much Lightning continu ally flafhing, but no Thunder nor Rain. We prepared for its coming from Noon to Sun- fet, making every Thing in the Ship fad, our Yards lowered as low as conveniently they could be, and our Sails made faft with Coils of fmall Ropes, befides their ufual furling Lines. At Nine in the Night it laid our Ship's Gunnel under Water, and I wilht our Main-maft had been away, which about Ten was effected, and it carried our Mizzen-malt along with it. On its going over board our Ship came to Rights a little, and her lee Gunnel was clear of the Water, but much Water getting down at the Hatches, we had five Foot Water in the Ship, and no Poflibi- lity of getting it out by pumping, for our Main-maft breaking in the Parteners of the Upper-deck, difabled both our Pumps. A- bout Midnight we had cleared the Ship of the Main and Mizzen-mafts, by cutting the Rigging that kept them faft to the Ship. By this^Time the Wind had fliifted from North- eaft to South-eaft, and had rather increafed than aiTwaged, and thofe two Winds had put the Sea in two violent Motions; howe ver, we got our Ship before the Wind, but broaching too brought her Head almoft to the Sea, which met her fo violently, that it broke ^ 1zzo A new Account broke quite over the Ship, carrying away our Fore-maft and Boltfprit, two Anchors from the lee Bough, three great Guns of twenty two Hundred each, with our Pinnace and Yole. We foon cleared ourfelves of the An- 1 chors, by cutting the Cables, and, before Day, we were quit of our Fore-maft and Boltfprit. About Eight in the Morning the Storm abated, and at Ten I called over the Mufter-roll, and found none wanting, but between feventy and eighty bruifed and wounded, who were carefully dreft by our Surgeons, and all recovered. The Sea con tinued turbulent, but we having two fpare Top-mafts, rigg'd them up, and having (av'd our Mizzen-yard and Enfign-llaff, fitted them for Yards, to which we bent Sails, and flood towards the Land, and, before it was dark, anchored near fome Iflands called Les Illm de Viados by the 'Portuguese. Next Morn ing we had much Trouble to get our Long boat out of the Ship. It was about 10 Tuns of Burden, and flrongly built; but, after 4 Hours Labour we put it into the Sea, and fent it afliore to try if we could get a Pilot, but found no Body on that Ifland; however, they met with two Pieces of Mafts of fmall Veifels that had been caft on- the Iflands, and thofe they brought with them, which did us very great Service in bringing us to the Mac- cao Iflands, which were about 15- Leagues from us. W e kept the Boat founding the Depths before the Ship, till we got about 8 Leagues onof the Eall Indies. 2,2.1 on our Way, and anchored in good oazy Ground, under an Ifland that kept the rol ling Seas from difturbing us, and in the Mor ning, by Break of Day, we difpatched the Boat in Quett of Maccao^ and to bring us Pilots. Before Night they landed at the Ci ty, and next Day returned with a Pilot and a Jonk to attend us, and, in two Days more, the Pilot brought us fafe to an Anchor in Teipe Queberado, a very fecure Place for Shipping to ride in. It is about four Miles from the City of Maccao, where I found a Company Ship called the Canterbury^ com manded by Captain Kingsfard, who had come from Jmoy in March, and could not reach the Streights of Malacca, fo was forced to pafs the South-wed Monfoons in this Har bour. I went to the City, and applied myfelf to the Captain General and the Procuradore for Affiftance, and they made large Promifes. I addrefled each of them with a Prefent of fcarlet Cloth, and Surat Atlafles, which they thankfully received, but foon after I found they were in no Condition to aflift me. They indeed defined to compliment me with fome frefli Provisions, but had not Intereft enough with the China Mandereen to get Liberty to fend them on board of my Ship. Nor would he fuffer any Body to fupply me with Neceflaries, till he received Orders from the Chontock orVice-roy of Canton. That Incivility prefaged but ill Succefs to my Af fairs there \ however, I went and paid him a Vifit,zzz A new Account Vifit, and prefented him with a Silver SaU ver and a Piece of Atlas on it, both in Va lue about 45* Tayels, or 15- L. Sterl. which he received, and made an Apology for his prohibiting Commerce with my Ship till he had received Advices from the Vice-roy. H e treated me with Tartarian Tea, which I took to be Beans boyled in Milk, with fome Salt in it, and it was ferved in wooden Difhes, as big as Chocolate Cups. When our Regalia was over, I took Leave, and he loaded me with fair Promifes, and fent after me a Prefent of an Hog, two Geefe, a Goat and fome Wheat Flour, and a fmall Jar of SamjheW) or Rice Arrack. Having nothing to do till the Vice roy's Orders came, I went among fome I- flands to find a Watering-place, and, on a pretty high Ifland about a Mile long, and half as broad, 1 faw a fine clear Stream trick ling down the Face of a Rock, about half a League from our Ship. I ordered my Men to fill about 20 Tuns of it, and being clearer than we had before, we made Ufe of it for drinking and boyling Rice. About ten Days after we had made Ufe of it, all my Men were altered with a violent Head-ach, and, among the reft, myfelf, which was a Diftem- per I never had been troubled with before. I began to fufpeft that the Water might he the Gaufe, and ordered a large Copper- pot to be filled with it, and to boyl one Half of it away, and fet the reft to cool a Day and a Night, which was accordingly done, and, onof the Eaft Indies. zi j on pouring off the Water, I found about a large Handful of a dark gray Salt at the Bot tom, of afharp unfavoury Tafte, which made me empty what remained of it into the Sea; but there was an high large liland about two Leagues from our Ship, that had many Springs of Water, which I tried, and found to be good. O ne Day I was difcourfing with a Tortus gueze Phyfician of the Quality of the Water we firft ufed, and he told me, that moft of the Springs in China had pernicious Qualities, becaufe the fubterraneous Grounds were (to- red with Minerals, as Copper, Quick-filver, Allom, Toothenague, &amp;c. and the Springs running thro' or near thofe Mines, the Wa ter becomes afFeded with their natural Qua lities, which was one Reafon why the Chi ne fe boyl'd all their Water before they drank it, and as the Boyling caufes the Spirits of Water to evaporate, they ufed Tea to in- fufe new Spirits in the Place of the old, fo that it was more out of Neceflity than Choice that the Chinefe drank fo much Tea, tho' they do not drink it half fo ftrong as gene rally we do in Europe. I x was near a Month after my Arrival be fore the Vice-roy's Order came to fettle my Affairs. They had reprefented to him, that our Ship w T as a Wrack, and, by the Laws of the Country, Ihe fell to the King; but the Vice-roy diftrulting the Report of the Chi- fit fent a French Gentleman to bring him true Accounts of our Condition, and what Mer-224 A new Account Merchandize we had to difpofe of. When the French Man came on board, I entertain ed him civilly, and gave him a Sight of the Muflers of our Goods and their Quality, and we had Allied up fome fmall Fir-trees, which we had converted into Malls and Yards. O n the French Man's Return, and giving the Vice-roy an Account of what he had feen, he feemed amazed at the falfe Information he had from Maccao, and ordered the Hafoa or Cuftom-matter to go and take an Ac count of our Goods, and take the Empe- ror's cuilomary Dues, and give me a free Toleration to trade. Accordingly the Ha* foa came, and brought three Merchants a- long with him to buy our Goods. When they came on board, they were furprifed to fee fo large a Ship, with fo many Guns, having forty mounted, and fuch a Number of Men, I having above an Hundred and fifty, f I faluted the Hapoa with fome Guns, and treated him with a Dinner after the Euro pean Fafhion, and gave him good Store of Wine to wa(h it down ; but he lik'd Canray beft, and drank of it till he was well fluflred. | Then he ordered the Length of the Ship to be meafured on the upper Deck, and the Breadth at the Main-malt, and departed. Next Day I went to vilit him, and carri ed him a Prefent as cullomary. In our Dif- courfe he told me, that he had brought a very honed Man along with him, who fpake the 'Fortugueze Language, and that he muit be my Interpreter at Maccao, and buy all my Pro-of the Eaft Indies. lij Provifions fpent in the Ship, and on my Table afhore, and that he had alfo brought three Merchants to agree for my Cargo, all Men of Subftance. I anfwered, as to the Buying Provifions, I had no Occafion for a- ny, and for making a Contra^ with thofe Merchants, I had no Mind to it, becaufe I de- figned to carry my Cargo to Canton in fmall Jonks, and when I arrived at Canton with my Goods, and had enquired into the Mar ket, it would be Time then to make Bar gains. He feemed to be angry that I was not directed by him, and told me, that he had taken much Pains to ferve me, but that I flighted his Service. I anfwered, that be ing a Stranger, I might be allowed to walk cautioufly till I had informed myfelf of the current Prices of Goods, and the King's Du ties to be paid on them, but I Ihould always have a great Regard to his Frfendftiip. He alledged that there was great Danger in car rying Goods between Maccao and Canton, becaufe there were many Pirate VefTels in the Way, belonging to Quanjl, and that nei ther the Emperor nor the Vice-roy could be accountable for what Robberies might be committed by thefe Pirates. I replied, that I defired none to anfwer for fuch LofTes, but would be very glad to meet with thofe Scar-ctows, that I might have an Opportu nity to make a Prefent of fome of them to the Vice-roy. W hen he found that none of his Argu ments prevailed, he gave Orders to have my V o l . II. p Goods216 A nm Account Goods put on board of fmall Jonks, and that I might put five Men of my own in each Boat for a Guard, and ordered one of his Merchants to accompany me in that which I went in, fo that we were twenty five Euro peans well armed, in our little Fleet. We took the inland Pallage, which was the near- eft, and failed by feveral Iflands on both Sides of us. I kept in the headmoft Jonk, and a good Officer in the fternmoft; and every Vef- fel we faw, they told us they were Pirates. I anfwered them, I wanted to be near them, but 1 could not perfwade them to fleer to wards them. A fter we had failed about 18 Leagues from Mac coo, we came to a fmall City cal led J an fan. The Teytock or Governor fent me a Compliment, and invited me alliore; but I excufed myfelf, becaufe the W ind was fair, and I w^s in Hafte to be at Canton. A- bout f Leagues above Janfan, we entred in to a Canal cut thro' a large Plain of Corn fields, where we faw many large flat-bot- tom'd Boats built to breed Ducks, which they bring up for Sale, and to weed the Rice Grounds for Hire. They have three or four Stories over one another, where are the Ducks Nefts. On the uppermoft they fit and hatch Eggs. In the others they lodge all Night; and it is wonderful to fee what Order and Oeconomy thofe Ducks keep; for fome old Drakes (on the Winding of a Whittle) drive all the younger Novices into the W ater ^fomc going foremoft to fliew the Way, while o- thersof the Eaft Indies. xx-j thers take Care that none loiter behind. There is a fmall Port made about a Foot high from the Water, and a Piece of Deal Board laid in it, whofe other End lies in the Water on a gentle Defcent, that ferves them for a Bridge to go out, and come in at when they are out about Service. The Mafter goes in a fmall Boat among the Rice Grounds, (for that Grain always grows among W 7 ater ) and winding his Whiftle, they all follow his Boat, and fall to their Work, to deftroy Frogs and fmall Fifb, with the Weeds that would hin der the Growth of the Corn. About Noon he winds his Whittle again, on which they all repair on Board of their own VefTel in good Order, fome of the old Drakes bring ing up the Rere, whilft others guard the* Bridge, to take Care that no Stranger Ducks enter with their own Tribe; and when all are in, the old Guardians enter alfo and take their proper Pofls. S ometimes when two or three of thofe Boats are employed in one Field, and their Ducks mingle, and fome young Novices,which do not underftand their proper Maftefs Whittle, chance to come in Company to ano ther Boat, and would enter with the reft, the old Guardian Drakes foon fpy them out, and beat them away from the Bridge, and on no Account will they fuffer them to enter, more than an eftablillied Company will admit In terlopers to enter into their Trade. Between Janfan and Canton^ which is about twenty Leagues, there are many pret- P 2- ty 1 '1 m\zi8 A new • ty Villages feated in the Plains, and the Pea- fants bring Fifli,Fowl, Eggs, Eatables to fell at very moderate Prices; and there are alfo lome fmall high Towers built on high Grounds, The Reafons why they were built I could not be informed of my by Compani ons, but the Foot of their Covering is hung round with Pieces of Glafs of feveral Sizes, fo near, that, with a fmall Gale of Wind, they beat againft one another, and make a pretty agreeable Noife. When I arrived at Canton the Hapoa or dered me Lodgings for myfelf, my Men and my Cargo in an Haung or Inn belonging to one of his Merchants, where none but the French, who had then a Factory there, had Liberty to vifit me, and when I went abroad, I had always fome Servants belonging to the Haung to follow me at a Diftance. I had ftaid about a Week, and found no Merchants came near me, which made me fufpeft, that there were fome under-hand Dealings be tween the Hapoa and his Chaps, to my Pre judice, but I could not be informed what they defigned. At length, one Ni^ht I had ■lupp'd- in the French Faftory, and began to J??* ^ orn P^ aint: to Mr. Tetchbertie the Chief, ot the llrange Method I was treated in, that all Merchants fhunned my Company, but for what Reafon I knew not. Hewinkt on me to follow him into his Bed-chamber, and, fliutting the Door, told me, that thofe three Merchants, or rather Villains, Lmqua y Anqna and IJemJha''jj had paid to the Hapoa 4000of the Eaft Indies. zip 4000 Tay els for the Monopilization of my Cargo, and that no Merchant durft have any Commerce with me but they, but withal ad- vifed me to carry fair with them, and bar gain with them on whatfoever Terms they would allow me. Accordingly I had a Meeting with my Chaps, and, in my Difcourfe, I told them wiiat the current Price was in Town for e- very Species of my Goods, and defired to know what they would give. They feemed furprifed that 1 knew the Market, and would fain have known who had informed me of the Prices, but I defired to be excufed on that Point, and to proceed to bid for them- felves-. My Cargo confifted in Cotton, Tut- chock or Radix dulcisy Rofamalla or liquid St or ax and Stir at coarfe Chints, which, ac cording to the current Market, would have come to 14000 Tay els, but they would not come within 80 per Cent, of the Market Price. I finding myl'elf infulted, had a Mind to wait on the Vice-king, who redded at a Town called Sac how, about ^o Miles up the River, and, in order to go thither, I applied myfelf, by the Afilllance of the French Lin- guift, to a Mandereen called the Churn pin, for Licence to go to Sachow, and for his Letter of Recommendation to the Vice-roy. The Netf s of my being wit»h the Chumpin a- Jarmed the Hapoa and my Merchants, who found no Way to impede my going but by feizing any Linguift that Ihould ferve me ei ther in Canton or in my Journey, and accor- P 3 ding-Z30 A new Account dingly, as I was going next Day to receive my Letters, and the French Linguift along with me, he had a fmall Iron Chain thrown over his Head, (a Cultom that is among the Chinefe when they arreft a Man ) and he was dragged before the Hafioa, and was accufed of allifting the French in running Goods on board of their Ships, for they had two lying at JVhampoa, a Village about 4 Leagues be low the City. The poor Man was kept in Prifon as long as I (laid at Canton^ and his Imprifonment fo terrified others, that I could get none to fervemebut whom thofe Villains | of Merchants recommended to me, and none durft ferve me as Linguift. I finding no Remedy, but Patience, to my diflurbed Mind, was forced to comply with the unjuil Impofitions of the Hafoa^ and fo flruck up a Bargain at the villanous Mer chants Rates, but to receive Silver for my I Goods; and after I had delivered them, I defired to fettle Accounts, and to have my Money according to Contra^. They made up a large Account of Charges, as 3000 Tay- els for the Meafurage of my Ship, 1000 for Liberty to buy Mails, Cordage and Provifi- ons, and icco Tayels for Prefents to fome Mandereens, and then they told me, for what remained I Ihould have Goods at the current Price of the Market, tho' I was obliged to take them between 40 and per Cent, high' cr. They made me pay 13 TayelsperOhzft. for Jnpon Copper, which I could have bought for 9 Tayelsy and for China Copper I was chargedinmirrii ■mBBm of the Eaft Indies. I charged ten and an half, which I bought at Maccao for feven, fome Hr Mafts that I cheapned for 60 Tayels they made me pay It was the Middle of ^January 1704. before 1 had ended my Accounts with them, and I wanted Permillion to go to Maccao, but that I could not have. They put me off, from Day to Day, about a Week. At length I vi- fited the French Chief, and he frankly told me, that they would not let me go till I laid out ten thoufand Tayels of Silver with them, which they were informed I had on Board of my Ship, and that my Merchants had told ^ him fo. I anfwered, that being bound to A~ woy, I had Bills on Merchants there for near that Sum, which, with my Goods, had been fufficient to have loaded my Ship there, for which Reafon I had brought no Silver with me; but I found there was no End to their Villany, and therefore I would go without Leave, if I had it not in three Days. He told ■fc. me of many ill Confequences that would at tend violent Courfes; but I anfwered him, That I could no longer bear their Infults, and, if I had not my Permiffion in three Days, I would run a Muck, (which is a mad Cu- ftam among the Mallay as w 7 hen they become defperatc) and that I thought twenty five Men well armed, were fufficient to go ofi by Violence, when by fair Means they could not obtain it, that being the laft Remedy, what Blood might be fpilt in the A6Hon, the Hafoa and his Chaps would anfwer to the &gt; 4!-. Em-ZjZ A new Account Kmperor tor, who, no Doubt, would enquire into the Caufe. I then bade farewel to all the Gentlemen of the French Fadory, and left a Prefent of fo Tayels for the Linguift that lay in Prifon, and came Home to my Inn, and acquainted my Men with my Refolution, who unani- moufly approved of it, promifing to live and die with' me, and immediately we new clean ed our Arms, and new loaded them with Powder and Ball, which the Servants of the Hamg taking Notice of, went and informed my Merchants what we had been doing, and that we lookt brisker than ufual. The Mer chants went to the French Chief, to fee if he knew what Dcfign we had, and he frank ly told them all that I had told him. They immediately acquainted the Hapoa, who forth- with lent us a Permit for ourfelves and Goods, and next Day I departed with twelve of my Crew, and iome Goods, leaving the reft to follow with the reft of my Goods and Mafts. three Days we got to Maccao, and got all Things in Readinefs to fail. There were two ] orttigueze lay in Ttepe-queberado waiting tor me to accompany them for fear of a French Cruifer of 31 Guns, that had been at Mani la One Mr. Burno commanded her, who had made his Brags to the Spaniards^ that he would bring all the Engl'tjh and Tortumeze that were bound from China to the Streights ot Malacca, into Manila, and make a Prefent or our Ships to the Spaniards, which fright- ned the Fortugueze, One was a Ship of twoZ34 nm Account Stocks Mark on them. I askt the Reafon why they did not deliver thofe Goods, fince, according to their own Account, there was a Balance due to me of iKcpTayels. They told me that they would give no more, and the Balance they would keep, for fear they Ihould lofe on my imported Cargo. I bid them farewel, and promifed to let them hear from me by the firfl Jonk of theirs that I met with. Next Day I fent them my Ac count, wherein I iliewed that they and the Ha- / vm had cheated me of 11000 TVy^//, and that I lliould not fail to make Reprifals when I met with any Effeds of theirs. According ly I did at Johore, by the King's Permiliion, feize a Jonk of theirs, and fecured their Books of Accounts, having two TortuguezeHzXives of MaccaOy who could fpeak and write Chi ne fe y and they found out what Merchandize belonged to thofe Villains, which I took on board of my Ship, among which was my 80 Chefls of Copper, and ioo Teculs of Tooth- enague, with my own Mark on them. I drew out a fair Account, and fent them with a Letter of Advice, that I had received but one third Part of the Balance due ro me,but upon their fair dealing with the Englijh for the future, I would forgive the rell, but if they continued to a6l like V illains, I would profecute my Refentment till I had recovered the lafl Peny of my Balance. W hen I gave the King of Johore an Ac count how they had ufed me in China, he Wondred that I did not feize all the other Mer chantof the Eaft Indies. 135 chant Goods that were in the Jonk, and fell the Men for Slaves. So having ended this Ihort Digreffion to Johore, I return back to Canton^ to give an Account of my Obfervations on that fine City and Country. CHAP. LI. Some Ohfervations and Reparks on the Tra vine e and City of Canton or Quantung, and of the ^Province of Fokien, with fome Oc- currences that happened there, CANTON was once a Kingdom of it felf, and was called Nangvee. It had been ieveral Times conquered by the Empe rors of China, and fhak'd off the Yoke when they found Opportunity. At laft, about three Centuries ago, it was fubdued and made a Province of China. It borders on Quanfi to the Wellward, Kiangfi to the Northward, Fokien to the Eaftward, and the Ocean waflies about 100 Leagues of its Coaft to the South ward. The Country is as pleafant and pro fitable as any in the World. The Ground yields two Crops a Year of Rice, Wheat, and Legumen. The People are ingenious, in- dultrious, and civil, but are too numerous, which makes them tolerate a bafe and cruel Cuflom, that when a Man thinks he has too many Daughters, he may deftroy as many as he pleafes of them, but they do not kill them out-z^6 A new Account outright, but ferve them as Mofes was in E- gyft, by laying them on an Ark of Reeds, and letting them flote on the Stream of a Ri ver, while they are Infants, and if any chari table Perfons fee them, and commiferate their Condition, they may take them out, and bring them up as their own, either for Mar riage, Concubinage, or Slavery. The abominable Sin of Sodomy is tolera ted here, and all over China, and fo is Bug- fery, which they ufe both with Beads and 'owls, in fo much that Europeans do not care to eat Duck, except what they bring up themfelves, either from the Egg, or from fmall Ducklings. Whoredom is not punilh- ed in this Province, tho' very feverely in fome others. / ? The City of Canton (lands upon the Eaft- fide of a pretty large River called Taa. Its Walls are high towards the River, but to wards the Lafl the Ground is a little hilly, and the Walls are much lower. The Walls are about ten Miles in Circumference, but fome reckon them Twelve, tho' there are large Spa ces towards the Eaft and South, kept for Gar dens, and no Buildings but Summer-houfes are there. There is a large Building of Timber on thehigheft of the little Hills to the Eaft, that {lands clofe to the Wall, and it bears the Name of the King's Banqueting-houfe. It is four Story high, fupported with great Fir Mafts, very finely painted with Vermilion, and japann'd and gilded, as are all the Walls andof the Eaft Indies. Cielings within it. From it a very fair Pro- fped of the City and Suburbs may be had. The Suburbs are fo large, that fome of them look like Cities. Half of the Number of Houfes built in the Garden Plots, would fill them up, and all the other vacant Places in the Town. There are many ftately Buildings in the City of Canton^ and above a Dozen of trium phal Arches in feveral Places of the City, and a great Number of Temples, well flocktwith Images. The Church makes an hand- fom Figure, but the French Chapel is but mean on the out-fide. There was a new Temple built by the King of Couchin-china, and dedicated to one of his Gods called Miglecky whofe Image is placed in it, in a lazy Pofture, fitting on a Car pet, with his Heels drawn almoft to his But tocks, clothed in a loofe Robe, with his Bread and Belly bare, and leaning on a large Cuftiion or Bolller. He is very corpulent, and always laughing, which merry Afpedt made me think that he might pafs for ^Democritus of Abdera in Greece. There is another Image of a young God that died before he reacht Twenty. He is plac'd fitting on a Chair, and as we approach near him, he nods his Head, by Means of fome Springs that reach from the Pavement that we tread on : However, this young dead Fellow (hews as great a Wonder in nodding to his Vifitants, as St. Charles of Millan does to his Devotees on the anniverfary Day of his Canonization. Can-I?8 A nm Account Canton was the laft great City of China that the Tartars conquered, when they over-ran that Country about the Year i6fo. and had it not been for the Cowardice and Treachery of the Governor, it might ftill have been an independent Province as well as Qnan/i. The Tartars loll above 100000 Men in redu cing it, for they lay nine Months before it, and the City novvife diftreft for Want of Provifions, having the River free for Com munication with foreign Places; but upon the Governor's Surmife that it might be taken Jit laft, and he and his Family facrificed to the Refentment of a barbarous Enemy, he fe- cretly articled with the General of the Tar tars, and perfidioufly opened two Gates in one Night, and the Tartars entring Horfe and Foot, foon made the City a Theatre of Horror and Mifery. I mad^a Calculation of the Number of In habitants within the Walls of Canton, by the Quantity of Rice daily expended in it; for they reckon icooo Teculs is the daily Import of that Grain. It is alfo reckoned, that eve ry Perfon confumes one Tecnl in 3 Months, fo that by that Calculation, there muft be a- bove 900000 People in it, and the Suburbs one Third of that Number, and there is no Day in the Year but iliews fooo Sail of trad- ing Jonks, befides fmall Boats for other Ser vices, lying before the City. A little Way below the City, are two fmall Iflands in the River; they have each a Caftle built on them, and their Garifons examine all VefTels and Boats that pafs by them. Tubof the Eaft Indies. 139 The Produ^ of the Country, befides Corn and Fruits, is Gold, Quick-filver, Copper, Steel, Iron, raw and wrought Silks, and be fides the Silk Manufadories, there are lack'd or japann'd Ware; and at Saclww there are much 'Porcelltne or China Ware made. We have the fame Sort of Clay in feveral Parts of Great Britain, that 'Forcelline is made of, but we want the warm Sun to prepare it. They reckon that the Province of Canton or Qumtungy pays yearly to the Emperor iiooooo Teculs of Rice, and xoooo Teculs of Salt, out of which is ferved out to the Mi litary (who are reckoned 80000 continually kept in the Emperor's Pay) 310000 Teculs of Rice, and 8000 Teculs of Salt. The reft is fold in Markets, at the common Price of ^ Macies a Tecul, which may amount to 446000 Tayels, which is appropriated towards the Payment of the military Expence,which may amount to 1000000 of Tayels yearly. The Cuiloms on Merchandize and Poll-money a- mounts to prodigious great Sums, all which are gathered according to the Book of Rates, and fent to the Treal'ury of the Province, for the Ufe of the Empire, which makes the Emperor's Treafury always full. Fokien is the next maritim Province to the Eaft ward of Canton, a very mountainous Coun try, and has about 90 Leagues of a Sea-coaft. It reaches from the Illand Lam a, which lies dire^ly under the Tropick of Cancer^ and makes a very fpacious fecure Harbour for14-0 A new Account for Shipping, between it and the Continent, but no Stranger frequents it,but to fhelter them from Storms, becaufe they admit of no Trade with Foreigners. About 3 Leagues without the great Lamoa, are fome fmall Iflands un inhabited. They are called the fmall There is a good clear Chanel between thofe fmall Iflands and the great one, of 15 Fathoms, on a good oazy Bottom. T he next Place of Safety for Shipping, is the Ifland of Amoy, where the Envltfl? once had a Faftory, and a good Trade, but now it is fliut up from foreign Trade, by the Em peror's Order. There are feveral fmall I- flands ly off it, particularly the Ifland Tangfi, by the Enghjh called Chapel Illand, and by fome the Hole in the TV «//, becaufe there is a large Hole that pafles quite through it, be ing undermined by the Sea below, but a- bove all is fail without Frafture. It appears like the Arch of a large Bridge. About fe- ven Leagues within it, is the inner Harbour of Amoy^ where Ships ly very fecure in n Fathoms oazy Ground, within 200 Yards of the Shore. The Town is built clofe to the Sea, and fome Houfesinit at high Water, are walhed by the Sea. A bout the Year 1645-. the 'Dutch had a great Mind of poffefling Amy y for the Con- veniency of its Situation and Trade. They came to an Anchor with five large Ships in the outward Harbour, and landed about 300 Men. There were none to oppofe them but a few Merchants and Mechanicks, who were foonof the Eaft Indies. 241 foon frightned, but were fo cunning, that be fore they left their Town, they left their Houfes well ftor'd with Samjhew&gt; a Kind of ftrong Arrack made of Rice, and with Hock- a Kind offtrong Ale made of Wheat- malt, by Fermentation. T he 'Dutch fearing no Enemy, or Defign againfl them, entred the Town, and fomein- confiderable People being left in it, were civil-' ly treated by the &lt; Dutch i and thofe poor Cbt- nefe fhewed their new Mafters the befl Houfes in the Town, where the 2)//^ took up their Lodgings, and, according toCuftom,carouz- ed heartily, that before Midnight there were but few of them fober, and fo went to ileepw The Ch 'tnefe who were left in the Town, went and informed their Country-men what Po- fture the 'Dutch Affairs were in. They ar med all they could get, with Swords, Lances, Bows, and Arrows, to the Number of xooo. and came on the Dutch, before they could put themfelves in a Poflure of Defence, and cut them all off, which Difafter made the Dutch depart without making any farther At tempt. This Hiftory is written in large China Charafters, on the Face of a fmooth Rock that faces the Entrance of the Harbour, and may be fairly feen as we pafs out and in to the Harbour. Amoy was famous in the Tartar War, be-' tween the Years 1648. and 1675-. by the Di- verfion it gave to the Tartar Forces at Sea, by the Courage and Conduft of one Cockfing V o l . II. Q aA nm Account: a Native of Amoy^ who gave them many De feats, and could never be brought to com ply with the Tartar Ufurpation, tho' he had many advantagious Offers to fubmit, but his Death gave the Tartars a quiet PolTeflion of the whole Province. A bout the Year 1648. the Tartars took ChincheWi a very large City, reputed to be as large and rich as Canton. They did not Hand out above nine Weeks, becaufe they forefaw that Want of Provifions would com pel them to a Surrender at laft, upon worfe Terms than they might have had, if the Siege had been but Ihort, however, they capitulated to have their Lives and Fortunes fecured, and fubmitted in all other Things to the Tartar Government and Cuftoms. This Province of Fokien, borders on Che- qu'tam to the North-eait, on Kiamfi on the North-weft, on Quantunv on the South-weft, and the Sea walhes the South-eaft Part of it. There are feveral Iflands ly on its Coaft, and Quamoy is but two Leagues from Amy, and is much larger, but not fo well inhabi ted, becaufe of the near Neighbourhood of Chincbew. In Anno 1693.1 was at Amoy, and then the Ifland was governed by a Chungcoun, or a Ge neral of 10000 Men. He was a Man of a- bout 80 Years of Age, of a very agreeable Afpe6i. He had done many fingular Servi ces to his Country, particularly in fupprefling Pirates that mightily difturbed the Province, and governed with muchjuftice and Mode rn-of the Eaft Indies. Z45 ration, but next Year he died, and was fuc- ceeded by a Teytcck, or a deputy General of 5-000. In Anno 1697. I went thither again, and found anew Temple built in Honour to the old Cimngcoun^ and his Image placed in it, as much like his Perfon w 7 hile alive, as ever I faw any Thing reprefented in my Life, with every Lineament and Feature in his Face, and I faw many Votaries worlhip his Image. It feems the Chinefe are fpeedicr in their canonizing than the Romans are. The Teytock has a Deputy called the Chungnae by Title, and another Officer called the Chumfin, who fuperintends the Affairs of the Sea and Rivers. In thofe three Perfons Hands is the Management of the Affairs of the Ifland, except theCuftoms on Goods imported and exported, and thefe are in the Hands of the Hapoa y who farms thofe Cufloms of the Court at 'Peking^ but the other three are put in by the Chungtock, who keeps his Court at Hock- few, a large City about 200 Miles North-eafl: of Amoy. T here are no beautiful Buildings in ora- bout Amoy y but fome Temples, in one of which I faw Hell painted in Frefco, on a Wall according to 'Des Cartes's Syftem ofUemo- mlogy, the Demons being painted in the fame Shapes and Figures as are in the Cuts oiTtes Cartes s Book, their Methods of tormenting the damned, very near the Notions delivered by Chriftian Doflors, and 'Purgatory bet ter reprefented according to the Dotfrine of144 ne ' w dccomt of the Church of Rome, than I faw it in a Church in the City of T h e r e are fome Curiofities in Amoy. One is a large Stone that weighs above forty Tuns, that is fet fo dextroufly on a Rock, in fuch an Equilibrium, that a Youth of twelve Years old can eafily make it move, but an hundred Men can make it move in no greater Motion, than that fingle Youth can. I faw it tried with a Pair of Hand Screws, but to no Pur- pofe. Another Rarity is of five large Stones, as big, or bigger than the laft mentioned, placed in an Hollow at the Foot of a Moun tain (whether by Nature or Art I cannot tell) they are each about thirty Foot long, and Twelve or Fourteen Diameter. They lean their Heads againft one another, and form an Alcove at their Feet, wherein is placed a Table, and Benches around it, of Stone, and there is a prettv clear Rivulet runs clofe by the Table. We Europeans frequented that Table on Sundays, for we often dined there. There is a fine large Citadel at the Back- fide of the Town, with good high thick Stone walls, and two Gates that face one another, and in the Middle (lands 'the Teytock's Pa lace. The Front of it is built of Wood, and the Back and Sides of Stone, as moil Man- dareens Houfes are in this Province, as well as the Temples. There are Sentinels and Guards always in the Gate-ways, but I faw nonp any where elfe, except when he gaveof the Eaft Indies. 245 publick Audience to Strangers, then he had about ^oMen attending at the Palace. T h e r e are about fifty Chrifiians in Amoy^ and they have a Chapel ferved by FrenchMit- fionaries, but the Pariflioners are of the Scum of the People, as they are of Chriftianity. I heard a pleafant and true Story about the famous Chimgbe^ who died in Anno ijis - and the Cbungtock of Fokien, who was alive in Anno 1700. which I had from Mr. le Blanc, a French MiiTionary, as well as from fome eminent China Merchants, and it happened about the Year 1690. the Chungtock being then Chungnae, or Deputy -governor of the ifland of Quamoy, that Ifland having about 30000 Inhabitants, not reckoning Women and Chil dren, they were all poor, and had their Sufte- nance by their hard Labour, in manuring the Ground, and Fifliing. A great Part of the Ifland being low and marilhy, by the Overflowings ot Spring-tides, made Travelling very incommodious. The Chungcoun being a Man of Pleafure, could not bear living at Home in rainy Weather or Spring-tides, and in going to hunt, he was obliged to go a great Way about, before he could reach the Places where the Game was. One Day in Council he propofed to take one Half of the miferable Inhabitants from their daily Labour, to bring Stones from fome neighbouring Mountains, to build a Bridge or Caufey over the Morafs, which was a- bove three Leagues long, and being the Em peror's W ork, it muftbe done gratis, * f Q 3 The2^6 A new Account T h r Chungnae oppofed it, laying down the the Difficulty, if not the ImpofTibility for thofe poor People to carry on fuch a AV ork, which could not be finilhed in lefs than three Years. He laid before the Council, that the Inhabi tants could hardly live by their Labour, when every one of them were imployed, and how could they fubfiil on the Labour of one Half, that he could forefeethe Ruin of the Whole by taking off the Half from their manuring the Land, and Fifliing. However, it was put to the Vote, and the Chungcoun carried it, on which the Chungnae laid down his Commif- fion, and protefted that he would not be ac- celfory to the Deftruftion of fo many Inno cents, whom he forefaw would be wrought and ftarv'd to Death, and fo bade the Chung- comi, and the reit of the Council, adieu. The Chungnae having fpent moft of his Time in the Study of Letters and Philofophy, had made a good Progrefs in both, and hav ing a fmall Fortune of ten or twelve thou- iand Tay els in Money, took a Journey to Tecking, to try if he could get into fome con venient Port in the Government there, but found that none was to be got, without Friends and Money, fo that he took a Refo- lution to lead a private Life on the Intereft of his Money, and to follow his Studies. A nd hiring a Chamber in a By-lane of the City, he fell to writing a Traft of moral Phi lofophy, being well qualified in writing a good Hand, and a good Stile. He began to write on the Imbecillity of human Nature, when ourof the Eaft Indies. Z47 our Paflions were more followed than R.ea- fon ; of the difmal Confequenees of Tyranny when fupported by Power, and feveral other fueh ufeful and commendable Topicks, and having carried his Work pretty well torward, one Morning he went to a Neighbour s Houfe to drink Tea, and forgot to ihut his Cham ber Door or Windows, which being on the lower Story of the Houfe, and facing the Lane, any Body that pad by could fee what was in the Room. The Emperor had gone abroad that Mor ning incognito^ to hear what News pad cur rent in the City, and accidentally came into that Lane while the Gentleman was at his Tea, and looking in at the Window faw z Book lying open on the Table, and the Wri* ting feem'd to be extraordinary fine, which made him have the Curiofity to enter at the Door, and to fit reading till the Owner fliould come in, that he might know both the Subject written on, and the Author. I x is the Cuftom in China for a Stranger, to read on any Book that he fees lying on a Table. If it be a Merchant's Book of Ac counts, they take that Liberty; and the Em peror having read above halt an Hour, was mightily pleafed with the fine Writing, and , ingenious Reflexions made on each Subjc6f by the Author. At lad the Gentleman came in, and was furprifed to find another in his Chamber, but the Emperor addreflhimin fo obliging Terms for his intruding into his Chamber without Leave, led by the llrong O a. Chains14-8 A new Account Chains ofCurioiity, and the Opportunity that offered to give him Satisfaction, by the Door being accidentally left open, that the Chun^ could take nothing ill that was done. The Emperor asked him of what Coun try he was, and what had brought him to 'Peking, and the Chungnae fatisfied him that he was a Native of Fokien, and re-counted the Hiltory of his Affairs in Quamoy. The Emperor was much taken with his Story, and the modefi; Way he expreft himfelf in it, and told him that he found his Anions to quadrate with his Dodrine. Then he askt the Chungnae if he had an Employment, or if he had a Mind to accept of one. He anfwer- ed, that he had been in 'Peking above a \ ear, and could obferve, that Merit was but a weak Recommendation to Preferment, and he did not defign to buy it. T he Emperor told him, that he was near ly related to a great Mandereen at Court, and that if he would accept of a Poll:, he would ufe his Endeavours to procure him one, for he found him recommended by two good Qualifications, Ingenuity and Honefty. The Chungnae thank'd him in very obliging Terms, and told the Emperor, that he was willing to accept of a Pofl, providing it was not too high, becaufe his Fortune was too low to fupport the neceilary Expence, nor too low, lell it fhould make him contemp tible. The Emperor affured him, that his Kinfman had^ feveral Pofts to difpofe of, and that he might depend on one fuitable to hisof the Eaft Indies. his Mind, and giving the Cbnngnae his Fan, ordered him to call at a Gate of the Palace' called the Elephant Gate, and deliver that Fan to the Captain of the Guard, and tell him, that you want to fpeak to a Mandereen of fuch a Name (as the Emperor borrowed for that Time) and the Captain would con- dud him to his Apartment; but withal he begg'd the Ufe of his Book for a few Days, and, as he was a Man of Honour, he would return it. The Chungnae complimented him with the Ufe of the Book,' making a modeft A- pology for its Incorrednefs, and fo they par ted for a fhort Time. The Emperor fent for fome Coleas y Man* dereens of the firfl Order, and gave them a pleafant Account of his Mornings Adven ture, and fliewed them the Book, which they were highly pleafed with, and the Em peror told them, that he had promifed the Author an handfom Poft, and defired to know if any were vacant. One Mandereen told his Majefty, that he had received private Advices that Morning, that the Chungtock of Fokien was dead, and that there would be certain Information next Day at Court, if it was fo or not, and that if it was true, his Ma- jefty might beftow that Poft on him, he be ing a Native of that Country, and confe- quently knew the Manners and Cuftoms of his own Country better than a Stranger could. His Majefty approved of his Advice. And150 A new Account And next Morning, according to Ap pointment, the Chungnae went to the Ele- fhant Gate, and enquired for the Emperor by the borrowed Name, and, on Sight of the Fan, was conduced by the Captain of the Guard to an Apartment in the grand Pa lace, and was ordered to ftay till the Cap tain came back to him. When the Emperor knew of his being in the Palace, he ordered a Council of Mandereens to be fummoned forthwith, and when they were convened, and himfelf feated on the Throne, the Chung- nae was fent for, and he paying the ufual Compliment of falling on his Knees, and bowing his Head three Times to the Ground, the third Time to continue in that Pofture till he was ordered to rife, the Emperor orde red him immediately to (land up. The Chung nae foon knew who had been his Gucfl the Day before, and would have begg'd Pardon for the Freedom of Speech he had ufed to the Emperor in Difguife; but the Emperor prevented him by beginning an allegorical Difcourfe, recounting the Chungnae s Adven ture at Quamoy, as if it had happened in a fo reign Country, and when he had made an End, he askt the Opinion of the AfTembly, what both the Chtingeotin and Chungnae deferved. They unanimoufly condemned the Chungeoun^ and commended the Chungnae, and w T ere of Opinion, that the Chungnae deferved a better Poft than he had before. The Emperor told them, that this was the Cafe of the Perfon before them, and that the Govern-of the Eaft Indies. zjr Government of Fokien was vacant by the Death of the Chuntouck, which Advices he had received that Morning, and that he had Thoughts of beflowing that Place on him be fore them, which they all approved of, on which he ordered Robes of the fecond Or der to be brought, and invefted him in the Office and Dignity, and ordered 100000 Toy- eh to be paid to him, in order to equip him for his Journey, and withal told him, that he expefted he would govern his Province ac cording to the Doftrine that he preached to others. Accordingly the new Chunt one k took his Journey to Hock/hew, where, on his Ar rival, all the Mandereens of Note in the Pro vince came to compliment him, and none mufl come to wait on him till firft introdu ced by a Prefent, which is pundually let down in a Book kept for that Purpofe. A nd among the Crowd of Vifiters came his old Friend the Chungeoun of Quamoy. Af ter the common Compliment of Genuflexi on and Proftration was done, he ordered him to fland up, and asking him if he did not re member him, he received a negative An- fwer. He askt him how his Government of Quamoy thriv'd, and how far the Bridge was brought forward. 'The Chungcoun gave him a fad Account of the State of his Illand, which, he alledged, was occafioned by a ra ging Plague, that had fwept off above the half of the People, and the Bridge was not car ried one Quarter of the Way forward. T henZJZ -A nts ® Account Then the Chungtock made himfelf known to him, and upbraided him with his Cruelty, and the Chungcoun having little to lay in his own Defence, fell at his Feet, and implored Mercy The Chungtock bade him rile, and told him, that for the fake of his Family, he would fave his Life, which he had juftly toifeited, but withal banilhed him to a Palace on the Side of an Hill on the Ifland of Quamy, where he Ihould be allowed xooo Toy els year ly, for the SubMence of his Wives and Children, but he was never to meddle in Government again, and fo difmifl him, and fent one along with him to take 1 oilemon of his Government, with Orders ico rero^ all Things that had been amifs in his Govep- ment, and to invite People to the Manuring of the Ground and catching 0 fFifli&gt; on better Terms than had been before. Thofe jult and generous Adions of the Emperor and Chung- took were worthily admired by all who lov ed Tuftice and Generofity; and I have born no fmall Veneration for both their Perfons ever fince. r I muft now give an Account of the ^r^'s Juttice and Generofity in an Anau re lating to fome fhip-wrackt Englijh Men at Amoy* C H A P' \of the Eaft Indies. 153 CHAP. L1I. Is a Continuation of the Hijiory of the Chung- tock ^/Fokien, in relation to fome Occur rences that happened among the Englilh at Amoy in Anno 1700. I Being then bound to Amoy in a Ship from Surai\ employed by Sir Nicholas fVaite the new Eaft-india Company's Prefi- dent there, and Commodore Littleton be ing then at Surat with a Squadron of four Men of War, by fome confiderable Reafons was perfwaded by Sir Nicholas to let one of his Squadron go as far as Amoy to look after the Englifh Pirates that then infefted the Streights of Malacca. The Harwich was the Ship pitcht on, a 50 Gun Ship, commanded by Captain Cock^ and we failed in Company as far as Ate he ens and there we were parted by a Storm. He called at Atcheen, but I made what Hafte [ could for the Port of Malacca. I ftaid there above a Fortnight for him, and when he had taken in fuch Provifions as he wanted, and that I had paid for them, we failed from Ma- lacca, in order to proceed for Amoy, W hen we arrived there, we found three European Ships, and a Country Ship from Surat, employed by Sir John Gayer Prefi- dent for the old Eajl-indta Company. The Supercargoes ot thofe Ships, on Sight ot a Man of War, fent a Compliment of 5*00 Tay~ els to the Teytock, to dirfwade him from gi- ving- 154 A new Account ving the Harwich Permiffion to come into the Harbour, for fear of lofing a Feather that they had put in their own Capes, of wear ing a Pendent at their Top-maft Heads, fo that when I went to pay my Compliment to the Teytock, and give him an Account of our Cargo, and to delire Liberty for the Man of War and my own Ship to come into the Harbour; he told me, that my own Ship was welcom, but he could not, with Safety, admit of the King's Ship into the Harbour, but that fhe might be fupplied with what Ihe wanted, in the Road. I told him, that the King's Ship's Bottom wanted Repair, and that if he would not permit her to come into the Harbour, both ihe and I muftgo to Canton^ and if the Captain of the Man of War refented the illUfagehe was like to meet with at Amoy^ thofe ought to anfwer who had given the Teytock that ill Advice, and fo I took Leave very ill fatisfied. T he Linguift and I had been acquainted fome Years, and, on our Way from the Ci tadel, I told him, that if the Teytock conti nued his Refolution of denying our King's Ship the fame Civilities that he granted to Merchant Ships of our Nation, I could not anfwer for the ill Confequences that might attend that Affront, and, if (lie had not Per- miflion in three Days to come in, on the fourth we would proceed for Canton. H e then very frankly told me, that it was none of the Teytock\ Fault, but the Englijfh Captains and Supercargoes, who had fent himof the Eaft Indies. 155 him with a Melfage to the Teytock, to ac quaint him, that if the Man of War was per mitted to come into the Harbour, their Men would be rude to the Merchants, and would be tied up to no Rules or Laws which the Merchant Ships obferved, that the Women would be debauch'd, and many other aggra vating Crimes, they alledged, the Man of War's Men would commit, and withal had fent the Teytock a Prefent of 500 Tayels to keep her out of the Harbour. I carried the Linguift into a Merchant's Houfe that was my Acquaintance, to confult with that Merchant about removing that Re~ mora that llopt the Man of War from entring into the Harbour, which could be done no other Way than by my being bound for the good Behaviour of the People belonging to the Man of War, and to give a Prefent lupe- rior to theirs, which I confented to. T hen we confulted how the Captain of the King's Ship ihould be received by the Teytock, when he ihould make his Vifit, and we agreed, that all the Captains and Super cargoes Ihould be called to the Teytock's, in Company w T ith Captain Cocky and that he ihould enter before us, and have an high Chair placed a little before the Teytock\ Chair, on the left Hand, which, among them, is the Place of Honour, and we Captains and Supercargoes to be fct on felt Cufhions on the Floor, and on the right Side of the Tey~ tock's Chair, which was raifed on a plat Form of Deals, with three Steps of Afcent.256 A new Account W e had no fooner done with our Conful- tation than I difpatcht my Friend Shawban* for that was the Merchant's Name, with the Linguift, to acquaint the Teytock with what we had refolved on, and he approved of all, and two Days after fent a Summons for the Captains and Supercargoes to accompany Captain Cock, and all obeyed but one, who pretended Indifpofition; however he fent his lecond Supercargo to fupply his Place. A s s o o n as we were in the Citadel, we were conduced to the Teytock's Palace, and entred the Chamber of Audience, and were feated according to the Method before agreed onw The Teytock being feated before, he made a Speech pretty long, wherein he told how he had been informed of the loofe Be haviour of Men of War's Men, which had armed him with Caution, but that he knew of a more convenient Place on an Ifland within three Leagues of the Town, for the Man of War to hale afhore, if we would be ruled by his Advice. The Captain made a Bow, and acceded to that Motion. H e then wanted to know who would be Surety for the Captain and Men belonging to the Man of War, that they fhould obferve the Laws and Cuftoms of the Place, without being Moleftation to the Natives. I found none cared to enter on fo hazardous an Affair, fo I flood ufj, and proferred myfelf, Ship and Car go for Security. The reft not expeding that the Captain could have found fuch Security, one, who made a good Figure among us, toldof the Eaft Indies^ l$'j told me, I was too forward in my Profer. I anfwered him, that I only engaged what I had the Command of, but meddled with no Body's Affairs elfe. The Teytock feemed well fatisfied, and gave us a very handfom Entertainment, and then difmift us. The Man of War went to the Ifland, and landed fome of her greateft Guns, but found fo much Difficulty in car rying Things afhore, that we got an Order from the Teytock to bring her into the Har bour, and accordingly fhe came in. T h e r e is an Ifland oppofite to the Town of Atoo% called CuUemJhoe, about half a Mile difiant, and it has two convenient Pla-f ces to lay Ships on, in order to clean their Bottoms, or repair them, and there are fome Rocks that ly between thofe Places, that ap pear dry at low Water. In one of thofe Bays the Harwich was haled afliore^ and cleaned, and her Sheathing being much worm- eaten^ it was repaired with a great Deal of new Sheathing, all which Charges I had Or ders from my Employers to disburfe on their Account, in Expeftation, that carrying back 2.00 Tuns of China. Goods would luffici- ently reimbuffe therni; but Captain Cock being a young Man, not very well verfed in the Aftairs of Shipping, took Advice of Tome other Captains of better Knowledge,-, and daily caroufing with them on board of his Ship, chanced, that Day that his Ship ha led off, to be a little inebriated, as w T ell as his Tutors. I was none of the Cabal, and fa V o l . II. R- ilaidZ58 A new ftaid in my Fadory. The Tide of Ebb was made before they began to remove the Ship from the Bay that Ihe had been fitted in, and in haling off, the Tide fet her upon the Rocks above mentioned, and on them Hie was loft. A s s o o n as the Ship fat faft on the Rocks, his Counfellers left him to think on his Mif- fortune. Next Morning all the Captains and Supercargoes went over to the liland (where he and all his Men were lamenting their Condition) to condole his Misfortune, but not one had the Charity to invite him to a Dinner. About Ten I went over to vifit him, and found him weeping. I dilTwaded him from grieving at what could not be re medied, and invited him to dine with me, if he was not pre-engaged. He then wept ve ry bitterly, and told me, that not one of all his Companions that had been vifiting him, had the good Manners to give him an Invi tation, and that f, who had jult Caufe to be angry with him for his Folly and Contempt of my Counfel, had ihewed him more Hu manity than thole who had fworn eternal Friendfliip to him. I carried him and his two Lieutenants a- long with me to Dinner, and allowed them a Chamber in my Fadory to lodge in, and, to (hew a good Example to the reft of the Captains, I took forty of the poor Seamen on board of my Ship, and gave them Provifi- ons. They were in all One hundred and eighty two Men and Bovs in the Crew, and thereof the Eaft Indies. ^59 there being five Ships, I thought, I had ta ken a large Quota for my Share, but not one of the rell would follow my Example, fo the Remainder, of the Crew were in Diftrefs for Want ofl^ood and Raiment. I went over one Morning to fee what Condition the poor Men were in, who had made Tents of the Ship's Sails, and I faw one newly dead for Hunger and Cold. I ufed all my Rhetorick amongfl my Bre thren the Captains and Supercargoes, to take Pity on the poor Ihip-wrackt Men, but they were all deaf to my Petitions, which obliged me to allow them a Pound Weight of Rice per Day each Man: And to clothe them, I bought three thoufand Yards of blue Cotton Cloth about a Groat per Yard Value, and bought them Needles and Thread, and gave them about 1000 lh. Weight of Cotton for quilting, and fo every Man was his own Taylor. But finding my Charges would be very great in maintaining fuch a Number of Men, and in carrying them PalTengers would take up too much Room in my Ship, which I could much better employ in carrying Gkr na Goods to Surat, I went to my old Friend Shaw ban, with my Confident the Linguifl, and held a Confultation how we might com pel my Brethren to be humane, and force them to take their Quotas of the poor di- ilreft Men, and we fell on the Proje£l to write to the noble and juil Chungtock at Hock- few before mentioned, to get an Order froro R i him ?i6d A tow Account him, that no Ship Ihould have Liberty to lade their Goods aboard, that did not firft take their Quota of the fhip-wrackt Men. We went to the Teytock, and acquainted him with our Defign, who much approved of the Projeft, and he feemed furprized, that any of thofe Ships durfl go into our King's Dominions, who had denied to affift, not only his Sub- jefts, but immediate Servants. He was very human, and fent the poor Seamen Prefents of Pork and Hockfewy (a ftrong fermented Liquor like our ftrong Ale) for me to diftri- bute among them, and thofe Prefents he fre quently fent. I provided a Prefent to accompany my Letter to the Chungtock, tothe Value of 40 Pounds Sterl. and got the beft Scribe in the Place to write my Letter, laying down the Mifery the poor Men were in, and how ea- fily and iuftly they might te reliev'd by fuch an Order. I fent my Letter and Prefent by an Ex- prefs, who returned in fixteen Days with a fatisfaftory Anfwer, and an Order to the Ha~ poa, to fuffer no Goods to be Ihipt off with out confulting me. The Hapoa came to my Fadfory, and congratulated me on the Ho nour that the Chungtock had done me, and promifed to obey his Orders in relation to flripping Goods off. A Gentleman who was Supercargo of the Ship c DorreU bound dire&lt;% from Amoy to England, was the firft that was denied a Permit to Ihip Goods off. He had fent for theof the Eaft Indies. 161 the Ship's Boat to carry off fome Chefts of Silk, but the Waiters itopt them from put- tin» them into the Boat, on which the Lin- guiil was fent for to know the Reafon; and he told the Supercargo, that the HaPoahzA received Orders to let no Goods be inipt ofi without confulting me firft about taking a Quota of the Man of War's Men; on which my Antagonifts held a Council, and refolved to continue obftinate, and that Supercargo before mentioned came early next Morning to my Houfe. When my Servants informed me that he was in the Court, I went and in vited him in. I guefs 'd his Errand .by his Countenance} and askt him to fit down, but he refufed. I askt him if he would drink a- ny Coffee or Tea, but he would not. He then, in a Fret, askt me if I of his Affairs. I anfwercd, no, nor did I know how he could ask me fucha limpleQueinon. He fware that he found I was, and that if I were in Another Place than jltfioy^ I durft not aft as I had done, and fwarc again, that not one Man of them fliould be entertained on board the'Dorrf/, I told him, that Idurft do any Thing that was honeft and juft, and was always ready to defend what I had fo done ; but as to his taking his Quota of the fhip -wrackt Men, he muft comply with it, it he had a Mind to fave his Paffage to England that Seafon. He ftill continued curfing him- felf if he took any of them, and went a- way in a very great Huff which I litilc ic*l6z A new Account I t was, and, I believe, is ftill the Cuftom on board the En^hjh Company's Ships, for the Captain to give a Remonllrance and a Proteft thirty Days before the Expiration of the Term for their Departure, to the Super cargo or Factor for the Company, according as^ it is ftipulated by Charter Party. Accor- dingly the Capiain of the IDorrcl gave in his Protefl about that Time to the aforefaid Su percargo, which aggravated his Chagrin, and he told the Captain, who was my. Friend, what Troubles I had brought him and the reil into. The Captain advifed him to confi- der what Time might be I pent in Contenti on, and that I, having the Government on my Side, would certainly carry my Point in fpite of all the Oppofition they could make, and that it would be much better to comply in Time than to {land out, and be forced to comply at lait. H e told the Captain, that he might do as he pleaied, but he was refolved to give him no Orders on that Head. The Captain bade him look what was agreed on in Charter- party, where they found, that the Com- mander ot a Company's Ship was to take no Paflengcrs on board of his Ship, on Penalty of ico L. for each PafTenger, without a writ ten Order from the Company s Agent where he ihould happen to be ; but where no A- gent was, he was then at his Liberty. A fter a little Deliberation, he bade the Captain fpeak to me of the Hardfhips they would be under in carrying fuch a Numberof the Eaft Indies. 163 of PalTcngcrs fo long a Voyage, and to try me, whether I would favour them in the Number of the Quota that they muft be ob- lised to carry; And the Captain came to dif- courfe me about it, and 1 agreed, that Cap tain Cock, his Lieutenants, and Seventeen more fliould have their Pallage on boaj d his Ship to England, and that thofe feventeen jliould be fuch as CmtimCocfhould choofc, that the Captain and his two Lieutenan fliould have Captain Hide, Table, they pay ing him xo L. each for that Favour all which the Captain confented to, and the buper- carg ;o and 1 became friends again. The other Sticklers foon complied, and took thirty fix each for their Quota, and ^ e reft I provided for, and t^iey weie as toi- ward to work and obey my 0r ^ 1 ® , own Seamen, tho' they were not fo M boa d of the other Surat Ship, where hey we.e like to mutiny for Vv ant of \ nf - before they went to Sea, for the Captain that Ship pretended, that he would allow them no Viftuals before they went to -ea, anTthe poor inaige,,; Fdb&gt;v S fjW W four Hours on that Pretext. At lait Hun frer compelled them to make then- Complaint to me, and I furniflied them with a bupp.r, and bade them be: eafy till ncxt Noon, and if there was no Provifron made to. them, when the Ship's Company's f&gt;' nr ' er v \^ , ca- dy, to feize on it for their o;vn Cle, and le the others ftay till more was dreft, which A R 4 vlccjmm A new Account vice they took to be very wholfom, and pun- ^ually followed it. The Captain complained to me of the Paffengers Rudenefs. I told him, that they only followed my Advice, fori could not fee what Pleafure he could take in ftarving poor Men, fince what they did eat was nothing out of his Pockets, for I knew the Charges would be allowed in his Accounts with his Employers, and advifed him to treat them civilly at Sea, fince they being fuperior in Numbers to his Ship's Company, might make them ufe Force to obtain what they ought to have by fair Means: Nor was I out in my Conjedure, for at Sea he put them to lb fmall an Allowance, that they mutinyed, and threatned to carry him and the Ship to Ma- dagafcary and deliver him to the Pirates. A bout Chriftmas I brake up Houfe-keep- ing, and paid Houfe Rent for Captain Cock and his Officers to remain in it a Month af ter me, and knpwing the Scarcity of Money among him and his Family, I gave him a Bag &gt;yith i coo Sfanijh Dollars for his Subfiflence oil his Voyage to Eyrofe, on condition, that when he was in a Capacity to pay me, he would not forget to repay me. 1 gave his firft Lieutenant jog . and the fecond Lieu tenant fo of the fame Pieces, but without 1 rovifion of Repayment. . The Captain made his Acknowledgments in the mofl emphatical Words he could ex- prefs, imprecating Vengeance to purfue him did not thankfully repay with good In- tereft,of the Eaft Indies. 16$ tereft, when he was able. I alfo wrote to the Lords Commillioners of the royal Navy, a- bout the Charges I had been at on acount of the Lofs of his Majefty's Ship in China, and petitioned that I might be reimburfed, and made Mr. Matthew Cock, a Brother of the Captain's, my Attorney, to folicite for, and receive what their Lordfhips would pleafe to allow me. I received a Letter from the Captain, then at Cape Bona E/perance, in his Way home, wherein he gave me an Acount of their hard Ufage aboard of the Ship, and of the Death of his fecond Lieutenant, and that was all I had from him in 23 Years. When I arrived in Englandyldid. myfelf the Honour to write him Ivovsx London to Leather-heady to try if I could furbini^up his fhort Memory with the Remembrance of what had paft between us in China, but he protefted that he had quite forgot it. I anfwered him, that his firft Lieu tenant, Captain Falconar, ftill remembred it very well, and had made a grateful Acknow ledgment of the fmall Favour he received a- bove twenty Years before.

Their Joffet or Demi-gods are, fome ot hu man Shape, fome of monftrous Figures, but in the Province of Fokien, they are more de voted to the Worffrip of Goddeffes than Gods. COuanhiem has the mod Votaries. She is placed in State, fitting on a Cuftuon with rich Robes, and her little Son (landing before her, with a charged Trident in his right Hand, ready to throw at Offenders of the Laws of Humanity and Nature, and alfo at thole who make no Free -will-offerings to his Mother.

She lus on a plat Form, withaCufhion laid on it, and her Head is covered with blue Wooll inftead of Hair. She is the Protetlrefs of Naviga tion, for which Reafon none go a Voyage l.rC I DUtof the Eaft Indies. 2*57 but they firft make a Sacrifice of boiled Hogs Heads, and Bread baked in the Steam of boil ing Water. It is fet before the Image when reeking-hot, and kept before her till it is cold, fhe feeding on the Smoke, and the Devotees on the Subftance, when it is cold. On their Return from a Voyage, they compliment her with a Play, either a^ied on board of the Ship, or before one of her Temples. They have another Goddefs in Form of a Virgin, called ^iionin^ who has many Votaries, but is moftly worlhipt in the Provinces of Te- kfjig and Nanking, but being a Virgin, Ihe has many Lovers all over China. The God Fe has an human Shape, except his Head, which has the Figure of an Eagle's. Gan has a broad Face, and a prodigious great Belly. Fo is a very majeitick God, and is always placed with a great Number of little Gods to attend him. in I take to be the God Miglett at Gz«^, being alike in Shape and Counrenance. He is called the God of Pleafure. Tuffa is fet crofs-leggcd ! on a Cufhion, befpangled with Flowers and Stars, and fhe has eight or nine Arms and Hands on each Side, and two before that (lie holds in a praying Pollure. In every one of her Hands (except the tw T o that are dedica ted to Prayer) Ihe bears fomeThing emble matical, as an Ax, a Sword, a Flower, &amp;c. The great God that made the Heavens and Earth, they bellow an human Shape on him, like a young Man in Strength and Vigour, quite oppofite to the Church of Rome, who makeld8 A nena Account make his Pifture like SaLv adore Winter, old, cold, and hoary. I have feen many more whofe Names I have forgot, fome with hu man Bodies, and Dragons, Lions, Tigers, and Dogs Heads, and one I faw like Stour Ton- ker in Fin land&gt; with a Man's Body and Clothes, and with Eagle's Feet, and Talons in the ftead of Hands. The Priefthood are in no great Efteem a- mong the People, being generally of low Ex- trad. They have many different Orders a- mong them, which are diflinguiflied by Bad ges, Colour of Habit,, or Faihions of their Capes. They are all obliged to Celibacy while they continue in Orders, and that is no longer than they pleafe. But while they con tinue in Orders, and Ihould, or chance to be convided of Fornication, they muft expiate the Crime with their Lives, except their high Prieft, who is called Chiam, and he al ways keeps near the Emperor's Perfon, and is in very great Repute, and he has Liberty to marry, becaufe the high Priefthood muft always continue in one Family, as Aaron\ did for a long While, but not half fo long as it has been in this Family, who has kept up the Cuftom above 1000 Years fucceflively, without the Intrufion of Interlopers. There are no Perfons of Figure or For tune that care to have their Children confc- crated to ferve at the Altar, fo that the Priefts who can have no Iflue of their own, are o- bliged to buy Novices of fuch mean Perfons as Neceflity forces to fell their Children, and theirof the Eaft Indies. i&lt;5y their Study being in the large Legends of their Divinity, and not having the Benefit of Converfation with Men of Letters or Polity, they are generally ignorant of the Affairs of the World, which makes them contemptible among fo polite a People as the ingenious and converfible Chinefe Laity are. Confucius, or, as the ChineJe call him. Con face, was the Prince of their Philofophers. He was near contemporary with Artaxerxes, Nehmi- *£,and Malach 'ty about 45-0 Years before our Sa viour Jefus Chrift, He both taught and pradi- fed moral Philofophy toPerfeftion,and acquir ed fo great a Veneration among his Country men, that his Sentences are taken for Toftu- lata to this Day, not one fince having offered to contradict any Thing that he has left be hind in Writing. They have another Doftor of Philofophy called Tanjiw, who was almoft as ancient as Confucius, and wrote many ex cellent Trafts of a virtuous Life, and the Me thods to attain to it, but his Charader is infe rior to Confucius's. Their Preachers take fome Apophthegm out of thofe great Mens Writings, for Texts to comment and exfpatiate on. They live very ab- ftemioufly, and rife early before Day to pray. Every Temple has a Cloifter or Convent an- next to it, and has a certain Stipend allowed by the Emperor to fupport the Priefls and Novices, but they get much more by letting of Lodgings to Travellers,who generally lodge in their Cells, than the Emperor's Allowance. Be- fides, they have a genteel W ay of begging from Stran-xyo A nm Account Strangers, by bringing Tea and Sweet-meats to regale them. , ' r &gt;'!; Ml The Chinefe don't bury in or near thdf Temples, but in the Fields, and when Bouzi orPrieft tells a rich dying Perfon, that fuch a Piece of Ground is holy, and that the infernal Spirits have no Power to haunt fuch Ground, they'll perfwade the poor Man that is diltemper'd both in Body and Mind, to buy it at any Rate to be buHed im and fometimes they will pay a thOufand Tayels for ten Yards fquare of fuch holy Ground. The Fiihers and Carriers by Water,who are born and bred in their Boats, and on the Water, muft alfo be buried in it, unlefs they have Money enough to purchafe a Burying^ place afliore. They have many Sedls among them, but all agree in the Tranfanimation ot Souls, yet not one Se6l periecutes another, but allow free Liberty to believe what they think beft, and it is very natural for Men to embrace what they think is belt, whether it is the bell or not. The Chriftian Miftionaries have convert ed many by the Indulgence of feveral Empe rors, particularly of Chungbee, and thofe A- poftles indulge their Profelytes in manyThings oppofite to the Syftem and Canons ot the Weftern Chriftianity, as Poyhgmy, Concubi nage, and the Invocation and Adoration of 'Paean Saints, as well as Chrtftian^ 'm their A- potheofis, which has caufed no fmall Diilur- bance at Rome, Whenof thg Eaft Indies. W h e n a Mandereen of any Confideration, pafTes through a Street or Highway, he goes in great State, either on Horfe-back, or in clofe or open Chairs, carried by Men, and he has Flags carried before him, and large Peets lacquered, and painted black or red, With large golden Charadetswrit on thdm, that gives the Defignationof hisTitles and Dignity.

Next to them are Fellows with fmall Chains in their Hands, ready to throw over any Body's Headend catch them by the Neck, that do not obey the Call of the fbremoft Men. And next them are Executi oners with their F-nligns of Cruelty, as a great Sword, an Ax, and fome large Pieces of Wood, painted black, and trailing on the Ground as they pafs along, to bamhow the Delinquent, which is by throwing them on their faces, and giving their Buttocks as many Blows with thofe Batons as his Worlhip \hz Madereen lhall order, and they have Caps like Sugar- loaves. I knew an Engltjh Gentleman now alive in En^landj that underwent the Chaftife- ment of the Batnbow. Y e t I heard of a comical Paflage that hap pened at Jmoy, between a Mandereen and EnMh Sailor. The Mandereen go ing anxyjr A new Account ing in his Chair, with his ufual Retinue, met a Sailor coming with a Keg of Arrack under his Arm. Every Body went off the Street but the jolly Sailor, who had been taftinghis Arrack, he was fo mannerly as to walk afide, and give the Mandereen the Middle of the Street, but one of the Retinue gave the Sail or a Box on the Ear, and had almoft fhov'd him down Keg and all. The Sailor d—n'd him for a Son of a Whore, and askt what he meant by it, and at the fame Time gave the Aggreflbr a Box on the Ear in Return. The poor Seaman was foon overpowered by the Retinue, but the Mandereen ordered to do him no Harm, till he had fent for the En- glijh Linguift, who forthwith came. The Mandereen told the Linguift what had hap pened, and bid him ask the Sailor why he gave him that Affront. The Sailor fware that the Mandereen had affronted him, in al lowing his Servants to beat him, while he was walking down the Streets civilly, with his Keg of Samjhew under his Arm, and fware by G—d that he would box the Mandereen 7 or every one of his Gang, for a Sfanijh\}o\- lar, and with that put his Hand in his Pocket and pull'd a Dollar out. The Mandereen ordered the Linguift to tell him verbatim what the Sailor faid, and why he pull'd his Money our. When the Linguift had told him all, the Mandereen was ready to fall off his Chair with laughing. And after he had compofed himfelf, he asked if the Sailor would ftand to his Challenge, who fwareof the Eaft Indies. ly? fware he would. The Mandereen had one Tartar in his Retinue, famous for boxing, who had won many Prizes at ir, and called for him to try his Skill on the Enpl'tjhman. The Tartar was a lufly Man, and the Sailor fhort, but well fet. The Tartar promifed an eafie Conqueit, and to the Combat they went. The Tartars ufe to kick high at the Guts, and the firit Time he kickt, the Sailor had him on his Back. The Tartar was much afliam'd of the Foil he had received, and at the Sailor again, but Jack foon tripp'd up his Heels a- gain. He defired then to have a fair Bout of Boxing without Tripping, which Jack a- greed to, and batter'd the Tartars Face and Brealt fo with his Head, that he was forc'd to yield to old England. The Mandereen was fopleafed with the Bravery and Dexterity of the Seaman, that he made him a Prefent of ten Tayels of Silver. In the Punilhment of Crimes there arc Laws made to proportion the Punifhmcnt ac cording to the Notoriety or Quality of the Crime. For Faults not capital, they ufe the Bambovj andWhip,or a Pair of wooden Stocks, or a wooden Collar, being fome Boards fixt together, with a Hole in the Middle for the Head to go. through. It is generally about five Foot fquare, and betwen 60 and 80 Pound Weight, that they are obliged to carry acon- fiderable Way in the Day, and lleep in it at Night, fitting with that continual Weight on their Shoulders,bccaufc there is no lying down, which Punidiment lalts as long as the Judge V ol . 11. S ' de-A new Account determines in his Sentence. Some they lay in the Stocks by the Neck, laid flat on their Back in the open Sun, with their tace con tinually towards it while it fliines, and this lads for one, two, or three Days, as the Judge thinks fit to order. T raitors , Murderers, and Pirates, are carried to Nankin to be tried and puniflit, ex cept a fpecial Order from the Emperor car ry Cuftom out of her Road. Thofe Goals in Nankin are only cleared of Malefactors once in three Years. In thofe Prifons they live in great Mifery, and often wifli for Death be fore it comes. Every one of thofe Sort of Criminals has particular Prifons belonging to fuch Crimes, and when the Judge receives the Emperor's Orders to reprieve fuch a Number, the Judge has it in his Power to fave whom he pleales of that Number fpecified, and the reft are im mediately put to Death, as fall as they can difpatch them with the Sword and Ax. lhave been credibly informed, that 30000 have been executed in one Month, and half that Num ber reprieved. When the Emperor gives fpecial Order for the Punifhment of Piracy or Murder, the Delinquent is tied to a Stake, and an Execu tioner cuts the Skin of his Forehead round from Ear to Ear, and pulls it over his Eyes, and then delivers him to the Friends and Relations of thofe that had fufFered Injuries by him, and they have the Pleafure of tortu ring him as they pleafe. 1 have heard of fomeof the Eaft Indies. 175 who have been tortured three Days and Nights before they expired. Others have had a Brick or Stone Cloke built round them clofe to their Bodies, by the Side of an High way, and a Guard fet over them, who com manded all PafTengers to fpit on their Heads as they pad by, and they are generally much longer a dying than the others. Parents have the Power of the Life and Death of their Children till they marry, and then that Power ceafes. Husbands have the fame Power of their Wives, if they are convifted of Adultery. I knew an Inftance of the latter in Amoy^ by a Chinefe that went a Voyage to Fort St. and from thence to England. He had a good agreeable young Woman to his Wife, and he pretended when he returned, to make his Wife ule the free dom of England^ in bringing his Wife into Engl'tSh Mens Company when they came to his Houfe, and made her eat at Table, or drink Tea with them, but not when any Chi ne fe Strangers were in his Houfe. However, fhe did not know how to behave her felt prudently in that State of Freedom, but was debaucht by feverals,and he going a Voyage to Canton, had ftaid ten Months after the Endijh Shipping was gone, and found her big with Child at his Return. He lent foi her Relations and fealled them, and then be fore them upbraided her for her Dilloyalty, and took a Piece of heavy W ood that they ll ^ e ^ ri pounding Rice, and gave her a Blow on the Head that killed her outright.1 m ]6 A new Account I heard of an Inftance of the other at Can- ton. A rich Merchant had a profligate Son, whom he fent abroad with a confiderable Stock to employ in Trade. In a few Months he had confumed all the Stock, and run in Debt. He gave his Creditors Bills on his Fa ther, who anfwered them for his own Credit. The Son came back, begged his Father's Par don, and proteiled, that for the future he would lead a virtuous Life. The kind in dulgent Father intruded him with a fecond Stock,and he, in a Ihort Time, deftroyed that alfo, and when his Credit was gone, return ed to his Father, who feemed to pafs by his Folly. But one Day he made an F.ntertain- ment for all his Relations, and when the En tertainment was over, he began an Apologue that came pretty near his own Cafe with his Son, and asked their Opinion what injuftice the Son ought to fuffer for abufing his Fa ther's Kindnefs, and ruining his Eftate. They did not know that he and his Son were the Perfons mentioned in the Fable, under bor rowed Names, unanimouily agreed that the Son ought to be punilhed with Death. On which the Father took a Knife and cut his Son's Throat, before either the Son or his Relations had the lealt thought of it, and then he thanked them for palling fo juft a Sentence, for that he and his Son were the real Perfons rcprefented in the Apologue. I f Children grow incorrigible,and defpife the Threats or Admonitions of their Pa rents according to Law, the Parents are to com-of the Eaft Indies. 177 complain of them to the Magiftrate, and upon full Conviftion, the Magiftrate will feverely correft them. For if a Son break the efta- bliiht Laws, the Parent fnffers Punilhment as well as the criminal Soi^if he had not before made the Magiftrate acquainted with his Son's Vices. A n d if a Parent is brought to Poverty and Want, and has not brought his Son up tp fome Calling, whereby he might get his Li ving, the Son is not obliged to alfifl his V a- ther, but otherwife he is. I n their Marriages the Bridegroom never fees his Spoufe till they are married, for the Match is made by Matrons of both Sides, and he is obliged to pay a Sum of Money to the Bride's Relations, before he can have her, and when all Obftacles are removed, her Re lations make a Feaft for the Bridegroom and his Friends, and after that is over, flie is brought vail'd into the dining Room, and he prefents her with fome Jewel of fmall Value, or fome Pieces of Silk Stuffs, and a Prieftfa- crifices a Cock, by cutting his Throat, and fprinkling fome of the Blood on them both, and then they are married by Law, and he feldom marries another while ihe lives, except in cafe of Barrcnncfs, and then he may take another, and fo on in cafe of Failure in TlTue, as far as four, but they cannot go beyond that Number, yet he may buy as many Concubines as he pleafes, and the Wives are ranked ac- cording to Priority, and the Concubines mull attend and ferve the \V ives.278 A new Account The Ladies Drefs is very becoming. They wear fine Linen Breeches that reach to the Ancle, but they are covered with a Petti coat handfomly platted, that reaches below the Ancle, and a Gown that reaches mid-leg down, tied with a filken Belt round their Middle, and each Sleeve fo large, that one would ferve to put their Body in, and reaches almoft to the Ground. They have a Collar of Embroidery handfomly cut, that comes round their Neck, and covers the Neck of their Gown, and reaches half-way between the Neck and Shoulder-bone. They have naturally a great Deal of Hair as black as Jet, which they fet on Wiers fitted to their Head, raifed four or five Inches, and covered with their Hair in a becoming Manner, and thofe who can afford Pearl, have fome of them bored on one Side, and let in their Hair, and they have two or more Gold Bodkins which keep all the handfom Fabrick fall. Their Feet are bound up with Rollers of Cloth when they come to three Years of Age, and are always kept hard bound, fo that all the other Parts of their Body grow in their natural Shape and Magnitude, but their Feet, which by Reftraint, are always as fmall as they were when firft bound up. Their pretty little Shoe has a Piece of Wood placed in the Middle between the Heel and the Toe, that ferves for both Heel and Sole, which makes them rather trip along when they go, for their Ambulation cannot be called W alking. Their Forehead is large, pretty fmall Eye-of the Eafl Indies. Eye-brows, well arched, their Eyes black, but almort hid with the Lids, their Nofe fmall and flat at the Eyes, their Mouth little, and pretty plump Lips of a deep Vermilion Co lour, their Cheeks and Chin in a good agree^ able Symmetry, and their Neck fmall, their Arms long and {lender, a fine little Hand, and to grace the whole Strufture of their Per- fons and Ornaments, the Nails of their Fin gers are never pair'd, but are let grow to two or three Inches in Length, to fhew that they are not employed in fervil Works. A nd thisFafliion of long Nails is followed by the Men of Diftinftion, and are carefully kept clean, and formerly, before the Tartars were their Lords, they wore their Hair long, rolled up behind (as our Women in Britain formerly wore theirs) and a Net of Hair or black Silk to cover their neat Rolls and Gold Bodkins, with double or treble Prongs ftuck in their Hair, to keep it in Order, but now they have only a Lock at their Crown, plat ted and hanging down their Back, and none are without that Lock, for if they have not Hair enough growing naturally on their Heads, they take fmall Locks of borrowed Hair, and twill in with their own to be in theFalhion. T he Men of Figure have a Coat of Silk that comes down to their Knees, and a lliort Doublet over that, that reaches no farther than their Loyns. Their Breeches are large and full, which come under the Tops of their Silk Boots, neatly made and quilted, for great S 4 'Men1 8o ^4 new Account Men wear no Shoes. l 1 hey generally wear on their right Thumb a thick Ivory or Agate Ring, very convenient for drawing their long Bows made of Buffaloes Horn, they being all bred to Archery, and exercife them- felves much in fhooting at a Mark. They wear their Swords on the left Side, with the Point forward, and when they draw them, they lift up their lacqued Scabbard, that the Handle may reach above their Shoulder be hind, fo that at the drawing of them with their right Hand, they can make a good and nimble Stroke on whatfoever they attack. A n d to drefs our China or Tart a?' Gentle man completely, he wears a Cap made of fine Mat for that Purpofe, in the Form of a blunt Pyramid, with a TalTel of Horfe Hair dyed red, that reaches from the Crown al- molt to the Bottom, and often an Amber or coral Button faflned to the Crown of the Cap, and they ufe a Piece of Hair-tape to come under the Chin, to keep it from blow ing off by the Wind, and to their Girdle they have a Purfe for their little Tobacco- pipe, which is made of fome Metal, and two other Purfes, one fmall for their Tobacco, and the other pretty large, with fcveral Di- vifions in it for their Money and Papers, all drawn clofe by lllken Strings, and their Hand kerchief is a Piece of coarfe Cotton Ragftuck between their Girdle and Side, one End hang ing to the Knee, and that ferves for a Towel and a Napkin alfo, and fo I have equipt him cither as a Courtier or Cavalier. Butof the Eaft Indies. z8l B ut the Maudareens of the Pen have a long Gown to their Heels, with Badges or Blazons on their Backs and Breads, to di- flinguifh their Degree or Dignity, and be fore they are admitted to the Degree of Do- dor, they muft pafs thro' feveral Trials and Examinations. They alfo wear a diftinguilh- ing Cap on their Head, and look as grave as an old Advocate. A Merchant and Mechanick wear the fame Cap as the Courtier, but their Habit is a long Robe with narrow Sleeves, and Stock ings made of coarfe Cotton Cloth, with fquare-toed Shoes, without Heels or Latchets to tie them on. The Peafant and FUhers are not tied up to fumpture Laws, but wear what they pleafc. Every Houfe, Ship and Firtiing-boat keep a domeftick God that they pay Adoration to Evening and Morning, and he has always a fmall flat Table with Ledges before him, fil led with Wood-afhes fmoothed over, and fmall Furrows drawn thro' the Allies in Or der, and thofe Furrows filled with Powder of Tntchock or Radix duLcts mixt with Pow der of Sandal, Myrrh or Olibanum, and the Compofition is fired at one End, and it gives a little, but pleafant Smoke the whole four and twenty Hours, without the leall Need of mending or renewing it. W hen two China Men quarrel, ( for they are naturally a little cholerick) if the Breach is fo wide that it will be difficult tQ be made up again, then they'll threaten not toz8i new Account to pay a n y Reverence or Refpeft to one an- others God, and that Word cuts off all Means of Communion and Society ever after. And fo I leave them, and proceed to my Obfervations on other Things. CHAP. LIII. Gives an Account of the natural Rarities of China, and of the Emperor s Revenue and common Expence. T^HERE are many artificial as well as natural Rarities in China. Their arti ficial ones are in llupendous Bridges, that give fafe and convenient Paffages over great and rapid Rivers, and over Vallies between the Tops of Mountains, to make Roads eafy and pleafant that would otherwife be very lleep, crooked and dangerous; but I never faw any of them, tho' I have heard much Talk of them. They have alfo great and convenient Slu- ces to check the Violence ot Hoods from Lakes and Rivers, and toferve out their Wa ters to lower Grounds, to moiften them and make them fit to yield good Crops of Com, but I being confined to the Ifland of Amoy, could not have an Opportunity to fee them, fo that what I add more to my Obfervations, is only by Informations and Reports from o- thers, (who had travelled where I had noof the Eaft Indies. 183 PermifTion to go) whofe Acquaintance I ca- fually fought after to be informed. I now begin again to continue my Courfe along the Sea-coaft to the Northward : And in the fame Province of Fokien is the River and City of Hockfew ; but whether the City of Hockfew be the fame with Fochew, I know not; it is very large however, and is famous for being the Relidence of the Chungtock, and in brewing a Sort of good ftrong Ale in fmall Pots of coarfe China Ware luted over with a Clay Head as big as the Pot. A bout twenty Leagues to the North ward of Hockfew begins the Province of Che qui am, whofe chief City is Limvoa, by fome called Nimfoa, and by others Ningpoo; however, it is a large City, and drives a great Trade. Here the Tortugueze were once well fettled, and had a numerous Colo ny. When the Chinefe were Matters of their own Country, and the Tortuguezx of the Seas, it is reported, that they had above one thoufand Tortugueze Families fettled in Limpoa, and were governed by their own Laws. Their Trade thro' China and Japon, which they carried in Shipping io-India and China, made them prodigioullv rich, which brought them into Luxury and Debauchery, and, at lait, was the Caufe of their Expulfi- on from Limpoa. They began to be notorious Ravifliers of Women. They would go into the Country Villages, and carry off young Virgins by Vi olence, from their Parents, and when they had284. ^ n€rw Account had abufed them as long as they pleated, fent them back to their Friends. Many Com plaints had been made, but no Redrefs could be obtained. At length, when a Parcel of Vir gin Hunters had gone into the Country up on an Expedition of that Nature, the Pea- iants fell on them, and killed them every Man. This Slaughter made the Torttigueze ve ry loud in their Complaints, and demanded Jullice to be done on the Peafants. The Peafants made folid Replications to the Com plaints of the 'Tortugueze-, and delired their Cafe might be laid before the Emperor, which was accordingly done, and the c Portu- gneze were ordered to clear themfelves ot the Crimes laid to their Charge, and they not being able to do it, were banifhed Ltmpoa, but had Liberty to carry off their Effe^s: And thus ended the moll opulent Colony, at that Time, in the World. Nanking is the next Province to Chequi- amy and the City of Nanking is ftill reckoned one of the largeil Cities in China, or per haps in the World. I have heard many lay, that faw both 'Peking and Nanking, that it occupies a larger Spot of Ground than 'Fe~ king, and that the triumphal Arches, Palaces, and other publick Edifices, are nobler than thofe at Peking. The Province begins at Souchew^ a large City, and one of the greatetl trading Cities in China, in Gold, wrought Silks, Porcellein or China Ware. It {lands near the Lake ot Ham-of the Eaft Indies. 185 HamcheW) which is about 10 Leagues longr, and 16 brond, of fine clear frelh Water, and it produces many excellent Sorts of Fifties, lome whereof are daily fent in Boats to Te- k'tnv for the Emperor's Table. Nanking City Hands on the Banks of the River the greateft, but not the long- ell River in China. It is fituated about 100 Miles from its Mouth, in a fine, pleafant, fer- til Plain. It was formerly the Metropolis of all China&gt; till the Tartars grew troublefom and formidable, which drew the Court to eking, to be nearer the Frontiers, in order to check their Infolerice. The ; Diflance between Nanking and Te- king is about 5*00 Englijh Miles. They have ^ Communication by Water in two royal Canals, one from Nanking to the yellow Ri ver, fo called from the Colour of its Water, and the other from that River to the City of 'Peking, or very near it. They are the Work of Art, done by the hard Labour of many Thoufands of poor Workmen, in Obedience to their Emperor's Order, to facilitate the Carriage of Merchandize between thofe oreat Cities. The yellow River, or Corcei River, is much longer than any River in Afia, or per haps in Europe, for there are 30 Degrees Dillance between its Source and its Mouth : And I heard one Mr. Fount an ay a Miflionary, who went to France on the Emperor of Chi nas account, about the Year 1694. that, he believed, there were as many People that lived28(5 A new Account lived in Boats and VefTels on the Rivers of Kiam and Corcei as in the three greateft Pro vinces of Fvancei for in their Vellels they keep Fairs on thefe Rivers, one Seafon at one Place, and in other Seafons at other Pla ces; and tho' there may be iooco VeflTels aflembled at a Fair, yet there is as good Order and Decorum kept, as in a well governed Ci ty. All Ships and Boats who have the fame Species of Goods are moor'd together along a certain Place on the River's Side allotted for them, by proper Magillrates, and, at Night, Watches are fet to prevent Thieving and Diforder, and Offenders are feverely puni- fbed, without Refped of Perfons. . There are alfo Fairs kept on the Royal Canal, between the Tellow River and C Pe- king, in which all the Sorts of Commodities that China produceth are to be fold. The Magnitude, Beauty, and Opulency of Teking, are fo fully defcribed by fome who have been there, that my Hear-fay Account can be of no Ufe, and for that Caufe I omit it, but the aforefaid Mr. Fountanay told me, that the Winter Seafon is much colder than in France, and, that in the Month ofNovetn-- ber, the Fraternity bought three Deers, and hung them up in a Pantry without Salt, and, when they had a Mind for fome Venifon, they cut what they wanted for their Ufe till the Beginning of March, and what was left then began to grow ftale, but not before, which Ihews the fubtil Coldnefs and Drynefs of the Air there. Andoj the Eaft Indies. 187 And now being at the End of my Journey on the Continent of I'll make fome more general Obfervations on the Produft of Chi na, and return to the Southward, to take a View of the Illands that face the Sea-coafts of China, and fteer back to the Northward as far as Jafon. A s there are many Mountains in China, fo they have many different Qualities. Some by their Situation and prodigious Height, Ihew their lofty Tops above the Clouds, al ways clear and ferene, but none dare pre- fume to go to their Tops, becaufe the Air being too much ratified, infenfibly takes a- way Perfpiration, and caufes Death. Others, tho' as high, by nitrous and fulphurous Mines in their Bowels, fend up thick Vapours that always hide their Tops: And at the Foot of thofe Mountains are Springs and Wells of Fire, that continually burn in their own Cells, but never break forth in any other Places. Other Mountains are cover'd with Trees of various Sorts. The Pine is the largeft, fome being fix Foot through, and four or five Score Covets high, or according to En~ glijh Meafure, an hundred and fifty Foot in Length, and they produce Bambows, as long, and fo big, that one Joynt between the Inter-nodes or Knots can contain above ten Catties of Water, which are of great Ufe to Sea-faring Men, to hold their frelh Water in. They alfo produce the Rofe Tree, which preferves an agreeable Smell and Colour as longl88 A new Account long as the Wood lads, which is not lefs than a Century or two. I n the fouthern Provinces, I have been told, that a Tree called QuanUng, has a foft Pulp growing within it, which the Inhabi tants dry and pulverize, and apply it to all the Ufes that Wheat-flour ferves for, hav ing the fame Tafle and Quality. I heard a Miffionary alfert, that not far from Limpoa in the Province of Chequiam, he faw fome Trees that bare a Fruit pretty hard on the Outfide, but within a fat Pulp, which being put a While in the Air, becomes good white 4 Tallow ; and it ferves for all Intents and Pur- pofes, for the fame Ufes that Tallow is put to, only with this Advantage, that it does not defile the Hand, nor greafe and ftain Clothes. All the Provinces of China are well ftor'd with Fruit-bearing Trees, and being of lo large an Fxtent, and the Seafons fo different, that in one Place it is Summer, while in ano ther Place Winter predominates, as in the Provinces of Quanjl and Quantung it is plea- fant Summer, while in Zanfi and 'Peking the chilling Colds of Winter, and Storms dilturb the Air, and fhut up the Pores of the Earth. All the Provinces produce Tea in abun dance, but Nanking and Chequiam afford the beft. I faw four or five Tea Shrubs grow ing on the Eaft Side of Amoy, but it was in the End of September, when all the Leaves were off It is pretty like a young Willow; and I was informed, that they plant once in threeof the Eaft Indies. three ^ ears, and pull all up, or cut down all that are above that Growth. I was alfo in formed, that, about the Middle of Junei they pulled off the firft and bell Leaves, and about the Beginning of \AuguJl they had a S. Sunqloa Tea, which is fomewhat grofler than the Bing or firft Crop. Both thofe Sorts are put under a Shade to dry with the Wind, and in September they flrip the Bulh of all Its Leaves, and, for Want of uarm dry Winds to cure it, are forced to lay it on warm Plates of Iron or Copper, and keep it ftirring gently, till it is dry, and that Sort is called Bohea: And I have heard others fay, that fome Grounds will produce none but fine Tea, and others again none but coarfe; but they all agreed in drying the the Bohea on hot Plates. On the Skirts of the Mountains they plant their Mulberry-trees for their Silk-worms, and cut them down at two Years Growth, 1 becaufe the Infeft delights moft in a tender Leaf. : There are many ufeful Trees in China that bear no Fruit. Some bear Beans, but of thofe I have feen in India at Surat and Bengal. One Sort they have that provokes Sleep, by laying fome of the Leaves in the Bed near the Patient. The Iron-wood Tree is commodious for making Anchors for Ship ping. It is prodigioufly ftrong and hard, and has natural Gravity enough to fmk it to the Bottom of the Sea. V ol . 11 T On3 .90 A nm Account o n the Mountains of JZett/f, near the fa mous Wall that divides from Tartary, grows Abundance of that ufeful and valuable Root Rhubarb, whofe Ufe is fo well known in Europe. The Root Genfing grows alfo in Woods there, and when the Natives go in Queft of it, to find it, they are forced to go in the Night Seafon, with Torches in their Hands, for fear of being aflaulted by the wild Inhabitants of the W oods, fuch as Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Rhinocerofes, ^3c, of the brutal Kind, befides dangerous Rep tiles, as Serpents and Snakes, which all ;flee from Fire. I have heard of Serpents thirty- Foot long, and five in Circumference, which lurk all Day in their Dens, and come out in the Nights, to prey on Animals that ly fe- curely in theirs. This Root Genfin^ when dried, is like a little Carrot, of a light yellow Colour, and, about Mid-way down, it branches in two, which makes the Chinefe call it the Man-herb. It has a fweetifh Talle, but, being much chew'd, it feems bitterifti. It is cut in Shreds, and drunk with Tea, and then it is efteem- ed a very great Reftorative of the animal Spirits. It is exceeding hot in Quality, and therefore to be avoided by thofe of flrong Conflitutions. It is excellent in Confumpti- ons, and, for its feveral good Qualities, is fold at a great Price, fome at three Times its Weight in Silver; but, after it is a Year old, it goes oft at a Shilling per Ounce, be- caufe it is difficult to keep the Worm out ofof the Eaft Indies. 291 it. Radix China or China Root grows in ma ny Parts of China, but the Illand of Aynam yields the beft. The Emperor's Revenues, by Report, a- moiiut to 180000000 of TayelS) out of which he maintains fifty Caloes or Privy-counfellers, at 100000 Tay els yearly. The Princes of the Blood are honoured with the Government of Provinces, and are allowed, out of the royal Treafury, from 5-00000 to 1000000 TVy- els yearly. He has fourteen Provinces^ wherein he maintains 80000 Soldiers in each, and each Soldier is allowed 10 Tayels per Annum in Silver, and a Catty of Rice, and an Ounce of Salt per Day, which are deliver ed monthly out of the Emperor's Granaries. In a Word, I look on China to be the rich* ell and beft governed Empire in the World. And fo having given the bed Account I can of it, I fteer my Gourfe to the Southward a- mong the Thilifpine Iflands, whofe Defcrip- tions I take by Report. CHAP. LIV. Gives feme Account of the IJlands of Minda- noa, Luconia, Formofa and Japon, with feme remarkable Occurrences that have hap pened on them. MI NT) ANO A is both the fouther- moft and eaftermoft of all the 'Phi lippines, It has little or no Commerce with T x Stran-zyz A new Account; Strangers, and I never heard of any Europe an Ship that went to it fince Captain Swan called there in his Way from 'Panama to In- diHy when Captain Uampieir was with him, who, no Doubt, has given a good Account of it in his Travels: And I know no more of it, but that it is divided into many fmall Principalities, and that the Sea-worm eats fo greedily Ships Bottoms, that in three or four Months they eat quite thro', and thit there is Abundance of Rice and other Provifions to be had very cheap there, and that it pro duces very good Caffia-lignum, or baftard Cin namon. It is about 140 Leagues in Length, but of a very unequal Breadth, having many large* deep Bays running into it, which af ford many Harbours for Shipping. Tapa-ya, or little Borneo, is a very long narrow Ifland, being 90 Leagues long, and but 14 or 15' broad. It breeds the belt Sol diers and Seamen that the Spaniards have in the Thilippines, but produces nothing for Ex portation. The Spaniards have a l H ort on the North-eaft End of it, and fo they have on the Illands of Tanay, Negrofs, Cobu, Leyte and Samar, They are all large Iflands, but have no Commodities for Export. And Mindora, that lies clofe to the liland Luco- ma, affords nothing for Trade. Luconia is the largefl of all the Philippine Illands, and is richelt in its Produ61ions, for it affords Corn, Fruits and Roots in great Plenty, as well as wild Game and Fowl. It produces Gold, but of a low Touch. It is notof the Eaft Indies. 293 not half conquered yet hythe Spaniards^ tho' they are polleft of all the. Sca-coait, as the ^utch are of Zealoan ; and the Natives lofe no Opportunity of cutting off their Lords the Spaniards, when they can do it without Danger. They have fortified their Moun tains and Vallies fo well with thick Hedges of Bambowsy that the Spaniards cannot eafi- ly moleft them, tho' they have fecret Ways to laUy out and ditturb their Enemy. T he chief City in Luconia is Manhila or Manilla^ the Refidence of the Spanifh ^ 7 ice- roy, and the Port where all the Galleons that come 3 7 early from New-fpahiy refort to. The Harbour is fpacious, commodious and fafe. They admit of Trade from India and Cbinay but not with any European Nation. The Mahometans are tolerated in their Religion, but not the Tagans^ fo that all Chinefc that go there for Commerce, get a little Brafs I- mage hung about their Neck, with a String of Beads in their Hands, and learning to crofs themfelves, cry Jefu fan ft a Malia (for they cannot pronounce Maria, becaufe the Letter R is excluded the Chinefe Alpha bet) I fay, when ihey have got all thofe fore- named Qualifications, they are good Spanijh Chrifiians. And when they have featherd their Ncft by cheating the Spaniard, and taken their Leave of Manilla or Manhila, at their paf- fmg by a Mountain dedicated to the Virgin Mary, they throw their Beads over board, and thank the Virgin for her Kindnefs to them, T 3 t'zo^ A new Account In Anno 1719. there happened a Mutiny in Manilla^ wherein the Vice-roy loil his Life, and he had a Son that might have fav- ed his, but was obftinate, and would needs follow his Father. It was occafioned by Op- preilion and Avarice, for the Vice-roy hav ing a Mind to fill his Coffers at any Rate, fet up a Tribunal, wherein the richeit Mer chants in the City were impeacht for high Crimes and Mifaemeanours, by fuborned Informers. Evidences were not wanting to prove Things that never were done by the innocent Merchants, and on thofe falfe Infor mations and Evidences their Perfons were imprifoned, and their Eftates feized. Thofe that had not been profecuted feeing their Danger, carried their Goods and Money in to the Churches and Convents for Security, and fled into the Country themfelves, till the Times fhould amend; but thofe Places of Sanduary were violated, and when the Merchants were fummoned, and did not ap pear, thei^ Eilates were confifcated, and brought out of the Churches and Convents by Force. The Arch-bidiop, and his Army ofPriefls, went to him, and laid the Peoples Grievan ces and his own Oppreflions and Crimes be fore him ; but he treated them rudely, which foon put the whole City in an Uprore. A cunning and bold Prieft of the Augtiftln Or der feeing the People's Difpofition to Muti ny, took a large Crucifix on his Shoulder, and invited all who were true Qatholkk Chri- fliansof the Eaft Indies. 295 Jfians to follow Je/us Chrijfs Banner, and afford Succour and Alliftance to Chrijfs per- fecuted Flock. The Citizens came thronging after the Prieft and Crucifix, well armed, and they marched direftly to the Vice-roy's Palace. His Guards all deferted him on Sight of the Prieft and Crucifix, and he and a few of his Domeflicks fired fome fmall Arms, and kil led fome, and wounded others, which fo en raged the Multitude, that they rufht furiouf- ly up Stairs, and fliot him dead. His Son was Governor of a Caflle a little Way from the City, and he hearing that his Father was in Danger, came with his Garifon to refcue him, but being 1 killed before the AfMance came, the Citizens complimented him, and defired him to return to his Poft, for they had nothing to lay to his Charge, but he re- fufed, and fwore he would be avenged on his Father's Murderers,, and beginning to ufe Violence on thofe next to him, his Men deferted him, and he foon fell a Sacrifice to his own Folly. There were above a Million and an half of Sfanijh Dollars found in his Treafury, out of which thofe whom he had unjullly robbed were reimburfed. It is about no Leagues from South to North, and the South End is about icq Lea gues in Breadth. It breeds good, hardy, fmall Horfes, and, if it were in the Hands of fome induflrious Nation, it is able to fur- ni(h good Materials to build a good Com merce with ; but the Spaniards arc rich, lazv T 4 and1^6 A nemo Account and proud, and rather difcourage than im prove Trade, or to engage the Natives to be civil and induftrious. T he next Ifland of Note is Formofcty but there are feveral fmall lilands between it and Luconia, which belong to China, tho' of no great Account, and becaufe they are flat and low, they are called the Bajhee Iflands. For mo fa is a noble Ifland, and produces many valuable Commodities, as well for the Suflenance of Mankind as for Pleafure and Luxury. It affords Plenty of Gold, raw Silk, fine white Sugar, Sugar-candy, and Cop per finer than in China, but coarfer than in Japcn, and feveral Drugs, as Gdllitrgal, China Root, Before the Tartars fubdu- ed it, it had Kings of its own, but tributary to China. The Natives differ much from the neighbouring People of China and Luco- nia, both in Philiognomy and Make. They are of a low Stature, with a large Head and Fore-head, hollow-eyed, and the Cheek bone very high, a large Mouth, and a Ihort flat Chin, with little or no Beard on it, long- jaw'd, and a fmall long Neck, their Body Uiort and fquare, their Arms and Legs long, fmall and ill-fhaped, their Feet long, and broad at the Toes, and generally they are baker-kneed. The En^lijb and 'Dutch had their Fadiories there, but about the Year 1678. when all Fokien had fubmitted to the Tartars, they were ordered to withdraw their Fadories from Teywon, a fmall Ifland clofe to the great one, on which their Fado- riesof the Eaft Indies. ries Hood. 1 he Englijh obeyed, and remow ed over to Amoy, but the Tiutch received Supplies irom Batavia, and endured a lon^ Siege, but were at laft forced to fubrait, the? they fold their Faftory, and many of their Mens Lives pretty dear, for the Tartars loft above 5000 Men in reducing it. It is now wholly under the Tartars, and the Chung- tock of Fokien has the Superintendencyof it. W h e n it was tributary to China, about the Year \6$o, there was a ftrange Diflemper raged on the Illandfor three Years together, for mofl of the Virgins between twelve ancj eighteen Years of Age, had a Trick ofhang- ing^ themfelves, in lb imch that very few Maidens were left on the Ifland, nor could any Remedy he found to prevent it, before aI ? China Man found one out, andaddreft himfelf to the King, defiring him to make a Trial of hanging ( all thofe that hanged them felves privately) up by one Leg on the Sides ot High-ways, for Paflengers to gaze on. The King took his Counfel, and hanged up fome fo, and in one Month's Time theMaidensre- frained from hanging, and have continued ; good Girls everfince. T he Religion of Teywon ( for that is the Name that the Chinefe call the Ifland of For- mofa by) is purely 'Pagan. They all wor- Ihip the Sun and Moon, and the Stars their Children. Some worlliip the firft living Thing they fee in the Morning, except a Lizard. Between Teywon and the Coafl of Fo- kien^ \y ihz'Pifcadores Iflands, fo called from the198 new Account the great Quantities of Fifli caught about them- There are many Shallows ly a good Diftance off them, on which an Englijh Ship from Su- rat, called the JoJiah, was fliipwrackt m Jnm 1697. but all the Men were faved; and on the Report of a Jefuite Miflionary who was Paffenger, that he had fome Things on board for the Emperor, one Mr. Reynolds the firft Supercargo, was forced to take a Journey to 'Peking-) who cleared himielr, but brought Scandal on holy Mother Church, for forging Things fo palpably falfe, for the good Father's Trunk was faved, and opened by pro per Officers, and not one Thing that he haa reported to be in it, was found. M any other Iflands ly along the Coallot China, but of no great Note, till we come to the Ifland Chufan, which lies off the Mouth of Limpoa. It firft became famous in the Tartar Wars, for many Chinefe of Note re paired thither with their Families, who thought to have found a quiet Retreat there, but they were miftaken, for by rrom Amoy, and the Tartars continually warring thereabout, they were haraffed between them, and at length a Garifon of Tartars fettled on it, and gave it their Laws. In Anno 1700. the new t-'Om panv of Enqland, fettled a Faftory on Chufdn, by Mr. Allan Catchfole before mentioned, but bv the Oppreffionof the Tartar Officers, and the Company's Neglea of fending Mo ney fufficient to carry on their Trade, Mr. Catchpole removed the Faftory again in theof the Eaft Indies. ipp Beginning of the Year 1703. and carried it to TuLlo-condorey as is before obferved. t r o m the North End of For mo fa &gt; to the South End of Japan, the Diftance is about axo Leagues, and in the Eair-way are feveral Illands of no great Account in Commerce. They are moft of them very high, and on one of them is a very great Vulcano, which con tinually fends forth a prodigious Flame that xriciy be feen in the Night above 30 Leagues Diltance from it. Btmgo is a Province of Japon, and was ho noured with the Name of a Kingdom, but a- bout the Year 1655. it loft its Title and moft of its Inhabitants, for being too zealous in promoting Chrijiianity by barbarous Ways. The Tortugueze found this Ifland and Jap on to be eafily brought over to their Notions of ChrUiianity, and that the Country abounded in Gold and Silver, drove a very great and advantagious Trade there, for above one Cen tury of Years. Nor were their Priefts idle in making Converts, for in the Space of 100 Years, they profelyted 180000 Families, when at the fame Time, the Emperor gave great Encouragement to the Priefts to go on in their Apoftlelhip, every one having free Li berty to embrace Chrift 'tanity, and had not the giddy-headed Chriftian Priefts, been too zealoufly hot and hafty, it was believed that the Emperor himfelf would have become Chriftian, but a civil War breaking out in Japon, and the Emperor's Forces much di- miniftied, the Chriftian Priefts thought it a pro-mM* 300 -d new Account proper Time for them to fettle their Religion on the fame Foundation that did his, by eftablilhing it in Blood. * l Their Thoughts run on nothing lefs than extirpating the Heathen out of the Land, and formed a Confpuacy of raifing an Anny of 50000 Chrift'tans to murder their Country men, that fo the whole Ifland might be illu minated by Chrijlianityt iuch as it wastheie. But the Emperor having Intelligence of their holy Defign, thought tit to prevent them, and coming to an Agreement with his rebel lious Tagan Subjefts, difcovered the common Danger they all lay under from the Cbrijii- aus, and they, to fecure themfelves, joyned their Forces with the Emperor's, but lay li- ient till they faw where the Chnjlians would begin their Tragedy, and it was not long be fore they began the IVlallacre, near a laigc City called OJfacca. The Emperor's Army marched fpeedily thither to chaitiie ^heii III- • folence, and a very bloody Battle enfued, wherein the ChKiJituus had the better. 1 he Emperor foon levied a greater Aimy, and engaged the Chriftians a fecond Time with Succefs, and quite routed them, and nevei gave them Time to form themic!ves into a- nother Army after, but followed his Blow, fparing neither Man, Woman, or Child that had been baptized, and the C Paqan Bougies or Priefts, were very good Informers, lo that in two Years, above 300000 Perfons perifhed by the violent Zeal of bigotted Prie{ts,and an Ediftwaspublilhedj that whatever CijriJtianof the Eaft Indies. joi fliould, for the future, be found within the Dominions of Japn, ihould be put to Death without Mercy. Many new Inventions were found out to torture the Chrtftians, and the Priefts were thb firft that made Trial of the Exquifitenefs of their Pain. The poor Women and Vir gins were torn Limb from Limb, by being tied to Stakes placed in the Ground, under the Branches of large Trees bended down, and their Limbs being faftned to the Stakes and Branches, by the EJafticity of the Branches they were torn to- Pieces. Children were thrown down Precipices, and dafht to Pieces, and Infants were drowned, and fo Romijh Chr 'ifiiantty ended in Japon, with a very dif- mal and tragical Cataftrophe. The Engli/h and 'Dutch at that Time had their Fadories on a fmall Ifland called do, that lay clofe to the Shore of the Ifland Bungo, drove a very advantagious Trade, but in Anno 1664. when the Shipping arrived, our never failing Friends taking the Advantage of our being Chrijiians, and com ing thither contrary to the Edi(4, were in Hopes to have a fecond Part of Amboina a- ded at Japon. They gave Information that the Engl'ijh were Cbrijiians, and not only fo, but that our King had married the King of c Portugal\ Sifter, and had a Mind to intro duce the 'Portuguese fecretly into Japon^ and how dangerous that might be to their State, they knew by dear bought Experience, and as an undeniable Truth of 3ur being Chri- ftidffsiox A new Account ft'tansy they might fee in the very Colours that our Ships wore, the Sign of the Crofs. Their Information had fome of the defired Effofc, tho' not the cruel Part. The Em peror being acquainted with the Stitch In formation, ordered the Englijh to be civilly treated, their Cargoes to be taken off their Hands as before, and a new J of on Cargo to be provided for them, in lieu of what they brought, and at the ufual Time to difpatch them, with llria Orders for the Englifl? never to return again upon Painof Death, by which fair Dealings the Dutch got the fole J upon Trade into their own Hands, except what is carried on by the Chinefe, . This Account I 4 had from Captain John /torTwho was in the laft Englijh Ship that traded to Jafon. Tm'Dutchwidi Chinefe are both limited I in the Numbers of their Shipping that trade to Japon, the Dutch from one to four year ly, and foe, ChineJe from Ten to Twenty. Af- foon as their Ships arrive, all their Crews are lent afhore to Houfes provided for them, and the Jafonefe take PolTeffion of the Ship, and all that fhe has aboard of her ; they un hinge the Rudder, and fend all the great Guns and Ammunition aftiore. Each Cargo is un laded and fent to the Fadory appointed for its Faftors, and there opened and repackt before proper Officers. The Goods are fent away without any Enquiry what they coft, or what they are content to take for them, and the Officers take a Memorandum of what Commodities they delire ift barter, and thofe areof the Eaft Indies. joj are provided and delivered on board their Ships by the Middle of Oftober, and about the Beginning of November they deliver their Rudder, Guns, and Ammunition, and are difpatched in Form, to be gone without De- %• T h e ©/^r^Faftory is now fettled ati\^«. gefaak, on a little Ifland clofe to the Shore, and are there confined, without a fpecial Per- mi/Iion from Court, either when they have a Defire to go on the main Ifland, or to remove from their Fadory to Batavia. I heard of a mortifying Accident that hap pened to the ^Dutch Affairs in Japon^ when Mr. Charron a French Man, had the Direft- orfhip of their Fadory. He had been feve- Times at yeddo and Meaco^ two great Cities where the Emperor keeps his Court, fometimes at one or other of thofe Places, as his Fancy or Affairs lead him. The Emperor took a Liking to Mr. Charron^ and often fent for him to hear the Accounts he could give of Europe. Charron prefuming on his Fa vours from the Emperor, begged Permiflion to build an Houfe on the little Ifland where their Faftory flood, on his Matters Account, which Requefl the Emperor granted. Accordingly the Foundation was laid very large for an Houfe; however the Buil ding went cheerfully on, till it grew into an handfom Fortification of a regular Tetragon. The Jafonefe being ignorant of the Art of Fortification, had not the leafl Sufpicion of Deceit, but fuffered them to finifh it. When^04 -A nm Account W h e n it was finiflied, Mr. Charron advif- ed his Mailers at Batavia^ of the Progrefs he had made, and defired by the next Ship ping to have fome Cannon fent him in Casks filled with Rubbilh, fuch as Oaccam or Cot ton, the Casks to be well bound with Iron p i Hoops, and the Heads fecurely fixt in, with Ibme Casks of the fame Make, filled with Spices, which Advice was accordingly fol lowed. W h e n the Shipping arrived, the Lading was landed according to Cuftom, but in rol ling the Casks, orie of thofe that contained a Brafs Gun, had the Misfortune to have one of its Heads kll out, and the Cheat was by that Accident difcovered. This put a Stop to all Commerce till the Emperor's Pleafure was known about this ttrange Affair. The Emperor forbad to interrupt the Trade, but ordered their new built Houfe to be razed to the Ground, and to fend Mr! Charron to Court, that he might expoftulate the Matter with him. The Orders were fpee- dily obeyed^ and Charron went to Court, and when brought before the Emperor, was much dejefted in his Looks to what he ufed to be formerly. The Emperor interrogated him on the dif covered Cheat, and finding he had no Anfwer fufficient to vindicate himfelf, the King up braided him with abufing his Kindnefs, and ordered a Barber to be brought, who pulled poor Charron $ Beard out Hair by Hair, and then a Fool's Coat and Cap were put on him, andof the Eaft Indies. joj and he carried through the Streets of Jeddo^ for a ridiculous Spectacle, and was fent back to his Factory with Orders to go off with the firflShips^that were ready to fail fol* Batavia, The Japonefe are flrid Obfervers of mo ral Rules, and particularly in Commerce, in fo muchj that a Merchant of Reputation, in pis Payments puts up 5-, 10, or any decimal Number of Cupangs, which is a broad, oblong, thin Piece of Gold ( of twenty Shillings Va lue there) into a Silk Bag, and putting his Seal on the Bag, paffes current for what the Seal mentions, for feveral Genierations, with out fo much as once looking what is in the Bag; and Gold is fo plentiful and cheap, that a Cup ang of twenty Shillings in Japon y palles current at Batavta for thirty two ShillingSj and when the Lion is ftampt on it by the Company, it pafTes for forty Shillings Sterl. Their Turcellein^ or Japon earthen Ware^ is finer than China Ware, but much thicker and heavier^ and the Colours brighter, and it fells much dearer, either in India or ku~ rope, than what is made in China, but their Tea is not half fo good. Their lackt or japon'd Ware is, without any Doubt, the beft in the World. The beil Sort will hold boyling Water without Detriment to it^ and is lb hard, that I have made a full Pafs with a Rapier againft a Cabinet, and there was not the leaft Shadow of a Mark to be feenaftcf the Pafs. They abound in Silks both wrought and raw, much flrdnger than what China produces. Vol. II. y306 A new Account with the neighbouring Iflands under its Dominions, is -about the Magnitude of Great Britain. It is in Length from North-eaft to South-weft, near 300 Leagues, and the Mean of its Breadth about 160 Miles. It is well peopled, and produces all Things necef- fary for human Suftenanee, in great Plenty. They are exaft Oblerversof Juftice, and ri gorous in their punifhing Crimes. A Man of Diilindion, if convided of a ca pital Crime, the Emperor fends him a Letter, that on fuch a Day, and fuch an Hour, he muit be his own Executioner on Penalty of exquilite Torments, if he lurvives the appoin ted Hour. So the common Cullom is, that the Delinquent fends for his neareft and bell Friends to a fumptuous Feaft on the Day let him, and after the Feaft is over, he ftiews them the Emperor's Letter, and while they are reading it, he takes a Dagger that he has about him for the Purpofe, and with it he ftabs himfelf below the Navel, and rips him- felf up to the Breaft-bone. The inferior Sort has not that Honour, but are fore'd to be contented with hanging, beheading, or throwing wer an high Preci pice, and for fmall Faults, whipping and Itig^ matizing are common Punifhments. Their Houfes are for the moft Part built of W ood, but the Emperor's Palaces are of Marble, and covered with gilded Copper. Their gilding is very durable, and can with- itand all Winds and Weather many Years. The City of Jed do is their Metropolis, and itsof the Eaft Indies. 507 Magnitude may be ghefl by a Fire that hap- pened in it about the Year 1660. which con- iumed, in eight Days that it raged, above 120000 Houfes, befides above ^oo Temples. 1 heir Religion is purely 'Tagan^nA m'tda is their favourite God, but he lives a great Way off, for a Soul is three Years in continual Travel before it can reach Tara- dife, which is only the Suburbs of Heaven ; however, when they once get thither, they are pretty fure of getting to Heaven, and they live very quietly in Paradifc, becaufe not one Devil dares come there to diflurb them. The magotty Zealots have a Trick of leaping oyer high Cliffs into the Sea, in or der to give their Souls an eafy Paffage to Paradife, the Priefts giving them Bills ofCre- dit to defray their Charges by the Way, andj no doubt, the mad Man pays the Priefl very handfomly for the Bill, and thofe Bills are fo good, that I never heard of one proteffed and returned. They have feveral other reputable Gods^ and every one of them has their Adorers and Devotees. One has three Faces, and he is Father of the Sun, Moon and Stars. Eve ry God has his own particular Paradife, but none are nearer than three Years Journey. Some of their Zealots cut their own Throats to get an eafy Paffage, and others hang them- felves. They carry their Idols in ProceffiOn on Horfe-back, with inflrumental and vocal Mu- fick to entertain them: They make many U ^ Feaftsmbjuub 308 d new Accomt Feafts and Sacrifices to their Idols, but they are only fed with the Smoke, the Votaries eat up the Meat. N o Japnefe d^res leave his Country, and if he does, he never mull return. They are fo wedded to their own Cuftoms and Opini ons, and fo jealous of having new or foreign Cultoms introduced, that they will not fend Em bailies to other Kings or States, or fuffer their Merchants to have Commerce out of their own Dominions; only they fend fome fmall Jouks or VelTels in the Summer-time, over to the Land of E/b, about 50 Leagues from the North End of J upon, and I have heard fay, that they bring much Gold from thence; but whether that Country is aPart of their Dominions or no, I never could get Information, but it is reported, that the Na tives of are lufty, robuft, and unciviliz'd, but fpeak the Japon Language. I alfo heard, that when Heer Matfui- ker was General of Batavia, he fent four Honkers to make Difcoveries of the Coun tries to the Northward, and to the Wellward of Japon, one of which was lliip-wrackt on the Coaft of Corea, and another on the North ward Coail ot Japon. The other two had been on the Coaft of Efo, but could not con- verfe with the Natives. She that was loll on Japon, had mofl of her Menfaved, and were kindly entertained, and fent to their Fadlo- ry: And twelve of the other's Crew that was loft on Corea, got alhore, and were de tained Prifoners. Nine of them died in fix- teenof the Eaft Indies. 309 teen Years, and three werefent in Company with a Corean AmbafTador to 'P eking. 1 hofe three profelFed themfelves to be good Catho~ licks, and the Church at 'Peking got them PalTage for Canton, where they met with Opportunities to get PafTage for Batavia, And now having made my Obfervations on all the maritim Coafts and Cities between Cape Bona Efferanza and Japon, I conclude, ^nd bid you Adieu.
