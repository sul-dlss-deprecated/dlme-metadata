[Cd. 6103.] Price Id.2 honour, by instruction of their Governments, to make to the Persian Government the following proposals :— 1. The two Governments are prepared, in order to meet urgent expenditure, to advance to the Persian Government a sum of 100,000L each. The Imperial Bank and the Banque d’Escompte will each open an account for this sum as soon as the two legations have received a favourable reply to the present note, and it is understood that the sum paid into the account by the Banque d’Escompte will be placed at the disposal of the Persian Government in roubles, amounting to the sum of 945,750 roubles. 2. The above-mentioned sums will be lent at a rate of interest of 7 per cent, per annum, and will be repayable out of the first proceeds of the forthcoming loan of the Persian Government, and until then the surpluses of the northern and southern customs revenues, which have hitherto been placed by the two banks at the disposal of the Persian Government, will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of and to the payment of interest on the Russian and British portions of the present advance. 3. The advance will be expended under the control of the treasurer-general, in accordance with a programme prepared by him in agreement with the Cabinet and approved by the two legations. It is understood that a considerable part will be assigned to the organisation of the Government gendarmerie with the assistance of the Swedish officers. In making this proposal, and in order to attain the ends indicated at the beginning of this note, the two legations hope that the Persian Government will undertake (1) to conform their policy henceforth with the principles of the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907 ; (2) as soon as Mohamed Ali Shah and Salar-ed-Dowleh have left Persia, to dismiss the fedais and irregular forces now in the Persian service ; (3) to discuss with the two legations a scheme for the organisation of a small regular and effective army ; (4) to come to an agreement with Mohamed Ali Shah on the subject of his departure from Persia, of his pension, and of a general amnesty to his folllowers. Hoping to receive a favourable reply, we avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. POKLEW SKY-KOZIELL. No. 2.

' ^ 1 ^ 11686 papers ’ the English translation has beenII III I 111 Tll—lWiHiWi — PMWHEW W ■ ■I f ‘Government, representing an advance on the first loan which Persia is about to contract, my Government agree that this sum shall be repaid out of the first pioceeds of that loan. In the meanwhile, interest will be calculated at the rate of 7 pei^ cent, per annum; and the surpluses of the northern and southern customs revenues will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of and to the payment of interest on the present advance. 2. In order to secure that this sum shall be wholly employed to meet expenditure already decided upon by the Government, and known to the two legations, the officer in charge of the treasury-general will be entrusted by the Imperial Government with the duty of controlling the expenditure defrayable out of this account. It is understood that a considerable part of the advance will be assigned to the organisation of the Government gendarmerie with the assistance of the Swedish officers. B. As regards the four points in the last part of the joint note, the Persian Government, convinced that the integrity and independence of Persia, as well as her peaceful development, are the object of the sincere solicitude of the two friendly Governments, welcome with pleasure this favourable attitude and reply thereto in the following terms :— 1. In order to prove their earnest desire to establish on a solid basis of friendship and confidence the relations between Persia, Great Britain, and Russia, the Persian Government will take care to conform their policy with the principles of the convention of 1907, and they take note of the assurances contained in the preamble of that convention. 2. In accordance with what has been decided in the programme of my Government, after the final departure of Mohamed Ali Mirza and Salar-ed-I)owleh from Persian territory, the mujahids will be dismissed and the other irregular forces will be disciplined and gradually incorporated in the regular forces, as the military organisation is developed. 3. With a view to the maintenance of order and security in the country, the organisation of a regular and effective army constitutes one of the fundamental points of the ministerial programme. It is evident that the army to be organised will be proportionate to the needs of the country. In order to convince the two Powers that they consider the organisation of this army as one of their most pressing duties, the Persian Government will inform the two legations of the programme of this organisation with a view to a friendly exchange of views on the necessary points. 4. As regards the departure of Mohamed Ali Mirza and the grant of a pension to him, in deference to the proposals of the British and Russian Governments, an agreement, which will form the subject of a separate note, has already been arrived at. In order to remove every obstacle to the pacification of the country and to the re-establishment of order, and to ensure that the measures taken by the State for the maintenance of public security shall be effective, the Persian Government are confident that the two neighbouring Powers will not fail to render them every assistance, so as to obviate all danger of a fresh attempt by the ex-Shah to enter Persia. Desiring to act upon the proposal of the British and Russian Governments, the Imperial Government will grant a general amnesty to the followers of Mohamed Ali Mirza. This measure will of course only apply to events and acts previous to the date of the amnesty, and will not extend to those subsequent thereto. C. Having in the preceding paragraphs given proof of their friendly intentions towards the two Powers and of their sincere desire to re-establish order and security in the country, the Persian Government are anxious to obtain the effective assistance of the two neighbouring countries on the two following points :— 1 2 1. For the immediate conclusion of the loan necessary for the realisation of the reforms, the conditions attached to such loan to relate only to the rate of interest, amortisation, and guarantee. 2. To effect the evacuation of Persian territory by foreign troops within the shortest possible period, in accordance with the wishes of the Persian Government.
