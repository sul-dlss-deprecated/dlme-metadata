Visit of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Chief to Bahrain.T In reference to the expected visit to Bahrain on 9th October of II.E. The Commander- in-chief in H.M.S. Nor folk with the flcptilla of sloops, I recall that on the last visit on 19th January 1935, before the Jufair Base was cpmple- ted, His Excellency anchored in H.M.S.Hawkins at bhe usual anchorage at Hanamah, in very close proximity to where the B.I.mails anchor; and I Believe that this warship drew about twenty-five feet. Invitations mve extended to local ashraf to visit the warship, and they greatly appreciated the opportunity. I suppose that on this occassion, anchoring in the neighbourhood of Sitra will be contemplated. It has, however, occured to me that if His Excellency should decide again to anchor at Manamah, this decision would be vsry greatly appreciated by the local inhabitants, who take pride in seeing a number of warships in port. pecially if a searchlight display is given at night, while at Sitrah these ships would be ignored. I while also feel that this would enhance the pres tige of H.B.M T s Royal Navy and the visit of His Excellency. I submit this point to you with deference; but if you consider the suggestion worth taking up, I feel sure that you will be good enough to forward it to the proper quarter. To:- Captain T.Hickinbotham I.A., The Agency, Hanamah. SM5. No. 2297-19/3. tho 9th September 1936 I enclose a copy of* a letter which de Grenier has sent to the Agency reference the Commander-in-Chie^s visit. I do not know what your answer to this will be. Personally I do not like the idea of going through the south entrance to Khor Kaliya in Diana, to get to the Norfolk, if she is at Sltra. The tides run very strong through it. 2. Previous to the arrival of this letter, I had made the following provisional arrangements for the calls in the event of the Norfolk anchoring at Sitra. The Shaikh’s party will see us drive to Jufair from the Balace windows, and will follow at an interval of 15 minutes: they will go out in their own launch, and leave the ship first. We go off about 10 minutes later. I suggest that I stand at the seaward end of the Jufair pior, and bring the Commandor-in- Chief to you at the landward end. We then 'encar' and go to the Palace, where the Commander-in-Chief gets his guns and inspects the guard. Steele will command the guard and walk round it with the Admiral; the Shaikh will wait at the top of the stairs. De Grenier has agreed to all this. 3. I am finding out from the Flag Lieutenant how many Naval Officers will call on the Shaikh, so that I know how many cars to arrange. I am also letting him know that the Shaikh must not be offered sweet things. I am inviting him to stay with me if he is not staying a t the Agency. 4. I am writing officially to notify the Bahrain Government of the dates, and to ask for the guard.5. De Grenier says that the Shaikh will definitely give a dinner on Saturday the 10th, but he wante to know the following pointa:- i. Whom is he to invite, beside the Naval Officers e.g. Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy, Skinner or other oil magnates, ether British residents than the British or Bahrain Governments ? The Naval Officers will, I presume, be the same party as that which calls on the Shaikh. Is this so ? ii* Are we to sit at a table or on the floor ? I presume that the answer to this is definitely 'table'. iii. What are we to wear ? We shall m*lt in tails. Would a white, or black and white, dinner rig be adequate ? 6 . De Grenier seems keen to put up one of the Naval Officers, and I have said that I will suggest to you that he puts up the Senior Naval Officer. He agrees to this, so may I confirm it ? 7. Is the Commander-in-Chief's flag to be flown on the Palace when he calls ? If so, I will wire to have it sent ahead in Norfolk, while the Commander-in- Chief is at Doha in Shoreham. De Grenier is going to let me have the Shaikh •s flag, to be sent up to the foremast of Norfolk when the Shaikh calls. Usually, the Commander-in-chief’s ship has worii the Bahrain Government flag. cards in Karachi. There are five bottles of sherry in the gedown.

The Union Viceroy flag has never been run up during the firing of the salute to H.E.The Commander-in-Chief; so I suggest that it should not be done on this occasion. It might not be well, during the Adviser's absence, to make an innovation. Unless Hickinbotham is really definite about sitting upon the iloor, it is felt that the Ruler's guests would be much more comfortable arouna his special table, which can seat eighteen diners, then sitting floor ff 01 ^ ld a l £ rge mat which could hardly contain more diners, ould you very kindly mention this point to him for his final opinion. Each guest will be provided with a spoon, a plate, and a table-napkin; and the manner of the dinner will be according to His Excellency's usual custom. 4.

To insist upon this rule would spoil the pleasure of a function which is keenly anticipated. Would it therefore be possible for this point to be put forward quite definitely to The Commander-in-chief, when one feels sun that he will take local conditions into con sideration when deciding upon the form of dress. I believe I am correct in recalling*that upon a similar occasion in the winter ordinary dinner-dress only was suggested. A white suit with black tie and cummerbund would be the suit able attire for this time of the year, when we are living under summer conditions. In reference to (5): Tx.e Shaikh’s Vizier informs me definitely that His Excellency The Ruler’s dinner will be given at a table, because His Excellency considers that his guests will be more comfortable upon ^ chaixy than U£&gt;on the floor; and I concur in this opinion. Otherwise the ainner will be according to the local customs. Captain T.

The return call was paid the same morning and the Guard of Honour was drawn up in front of the Palace. The Commander-in-Chief walked round the guard with the Acting Commandant of Police. The Coramander-in-Chief was attended by his Secretary and Flag Lieutenant. The Senior Naval Officer was also present with Captain L.H.K. Hamilton, D.S.O., R.N., the Flag Captain.

On another occasion it would be more satisfactory to have the food in the main reception room or else on the verandah as the odour of much mutton i in a confined space coupled with the sight of an unusual quantity of meat is liaole to give rise to a feeling of nausea when experienced for the first time by elderly gentlemen of fastidious tastes. 11th October. There was a naval tour of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s premises. The details of the numbers who were invited is on the file. His Excellency the Shaikh, very kindly placed his car at the disposal of the Political Agent for the Admiral’s use. lii*.

The Political Agent also returned with the party. A cinema film was shown after dinner and was rather tedious and long and the Shaikh left at halftime. It would be advisable on another occasion to have two distinct parties. One exclusively official at which the Shaikh and his relatives, the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent and the Adviser would be the only persons invited and the other social at which the European and American society are invited.

NORFOLK at Bushire.MM © A Translation of letter No*7Q0 dated tiie 14tn October, 193b from tne Residency Agent, Snarjan to tne Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments. Regarding tne visit of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Gnief, East Indies Squadron. I beg to state that on Tuesday the bth October 193b, the Rulers of Has al Khaiman, Umm-al-^aiwain, the Headman of Hamriyah and the Ruler of Ujman arrived at Snarjah. The Shailoi of Ras-al-Khaiman came in his own launch in the morning accompanied by his son Salim and 30 men of his followers. He stayed in his launch at Layyah. The Ruler of T A]man arrived on land by camel in the afternoon accompanied by his son Ali and ten followers. The Ruler of Umm-al-Qaiwain arrived in the evening in a special launch which I had sent to him, accompanied by his brother Munammad, his cousin ADdullan bin Sai T d, Salim bin Hamad a notable of Umm-al-Qaiwain and three servants. On his way from Omm-al-Qaiwain he called at Hamriyah and picked up Shaikh Mumaid Din Abdur Rahman, Headman of Hamriyah and his servant and brought him along with him as was done last time. Tne Ruler of Umm-al-Qaiwain, Snaikh of Hamriyah and the Ruler of'’Ajman put up wixn me and I prepared a separate furnished place for eacn of them equipped with all requirements which might ensure their comfort according to the custom prevailing in the Oman Coast. 2. At 6 0 T clock (English time) H.M.S. Norfolk escorted by H.M.S. Shorenam arrived and H.M.S. Norfolk anchored-2r s(3 f jb v - anchored two miles off the snore. H.M.S. Shoreham came nearer and anchored one mile oft the shore. Alter H.M.S. Norfolk had anchored, a number of officers landed. His Excellency the CommancLer-in-Chief accompanied by iour of the senior officers landed and went round the town. His Excellency the Commander-in-Cnief passed by the Shaikh’s Qasr and looked at tne horses, camels and guns around itj but no one recognised him. The attitude o± people in the places through which they passed was friendly; and they returned to the ship at sunset. 3. All the Shaikhs were informed some days before their arrival at Sharjah of the arrangements about embarking and disembarking and also about His Excellency the Commander-in-Cnief f s reception of them. On Tuesday evening, 6tn October, the programme of the meeting attached herewith was written and a copy was given to each of the Rulers. Tnree launches were kept ready to carry the Shaikhs from the shore to the ship and to land them from her. I informed the Nakhuaa of each launch about the arrangements for conveying tne Rulers. As regards tne Ruler of Duoai, arrangement was mane that he should come on Wednesday morning one hour before the fixed time and wait at Layyah, where all the launches were. 4. The Ruler of Dubai arrived at Layyah and all the Shaikhs got into tneir launches one hour before the fixed time. 5. I went on board H.M.S. Snorenam exactly at 8.30 (English time) and after half an hour the Ruler ol Dubai arrived followed by the Shaikhs of Sharjah, T Ajman, Umm-al-Qaiwain and Ras al Knaimah. Wnen they had ail gatheredgathered togethered, H.M.S. Snorenam sailea and anchored I went first on board H.M.S. Norioik near H.M.S. Norfoli^and tne Shaikhs were transferred to her by small launches according to tne attached list. When they had all embarked, the Senior Naval Ofiicer, Persian Gulf' arrived. After he had got on to the snip, the Guard of Honour and the Band were paraded. His Excellency the Commander-in-Gniei came up to the place of reception and on his arrival at the place appointed for him, saluting music was played, while every one was standing. After this the Senior Naval Officer stepped forward and introduced me to His Excellency the Gommander- in-Ghief and stood asidej and I in turn introduced the Shaikhs one after another. At the time of reception the Ruler of Dubai offered a dagger to His Excellency the Commander-m-Chief and sent Halwa, beef and mutton to H.M.S. Norfolk. A place was arranged behind the place of reception where refreshments and biscuits were kept. The ShailOis went there after they had been introduced to His Excellency the Commander-in-Gmef. Af ter the introduction of the Shaikhs was over, His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief followed them and asked for tne introduction of tne relatives of Snaixns wno were permitted by His Excellency to accompany them. Yifhen tne introduction was over, His Excellency the Commander-m- Ghief took his seat leaving a chair for me on his right side and started talking to every one of them. Tnen came tne Senior Naval Officer and a number of Senior Offi cers and started exchanging conversation and courtesies with the Rulers and their relatives. Glasses of Sharbat, biscuits, chocolates and coffee were served round. Afterwards they returned to the first place of reception where I obtained a list of all who were present. Tne Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, went to H.M.S. ShorenamSnorenam and the Snaikhs departed as arranged wnen they embarked. Tne Commander-in-Gnief oiiered every one of them a present wnen wisning them farewell. H.M.S. Norfolk fired a salute on the disembarkation oi each Ruler. Wnen they had all disembarked I was transferred to H.M.S. Snoreham. As soon as I got on board, the ship went to the former place, where the Rulers were landed according to the programme.

Enclosure :2ReceiptsThe 1st December 1936 D&gt;0, No&gt;2948-19/3 With reference to your letter of the 30th November 1936 and the signal enclosed with it about the taxis for 'Norfolk’s' visit to the oilfields. 2# On the 6th October I wrote for the Political Agent to Tellis to warn him that the 'Norfolk’s' officers would require six cars at Sitrah pier at 7 a.m. on October 11th. 3. I3y mistake, the officers landed at Jufair, and the cars had to be sent there for then. The party then went round the oilfields, finishing, I should estimate, though I was not in their party, at 1 p.m. -On the 20th October Tellis sent to the Agency a bill from Messrs Alajaji, in which f;s.25/- was claimed for each of the following six taxis, namely Nos. Commander M.H. Evelegh H.N., H.M.S. FOWEY.This bill was Nos. 73 f 138| 182 f 196 f 186, and 76. returned to him on the 26th October with the remark that as the taxis were used by the officers of H.M.S. Norfolk the debit should be raised against then and not against the Agency. 1 also remarked that the bill appeared to me to be excessive, and that I thought he would do well to examine the details of it before submitting it to H.V.S. *— ,: *~* ,, * petition from one ruhamrned Taqi, e copy of which 1 enclose. You will see that the numbers are not those given in ray 6th paragraph; and they are stated to have been orqeroa by Tellis on 11th October. As the visit to the oilfields began at 7 a.m. on 11th (ctober, I think we may assume that this is a different lot of taxis, possibly for a sports team. Tellis should be able to inform you about this. 7* Commander Gregory, the Admiral’s Secretary, gave me Rs.60/-, but this was for a different taxi which was kept by the Agency for the duration of the Admiral’s visit. This has nothing to do with the matter we are talking about, but I put this in in case there should be any confusionconfusion 8* I agree entirely with you that we cannot ask the Oil Company to pay this bill. I personally thi^k it is reasonable to expect 'Norfolk's” Ward-room and Gun-room to rt ante up' f as the taxis were used by them; but it might be regarded as part of the Agency's entertainment to the ship, in which case it falls on us. 9. The normal rate for taxis in this town is Hs.lO/- per day if petrol is supplied* or Hs.15/- to 20/-, all found. The quality of the taxi has to be considered. Tellis ought, I think, to know what taxis he ordered and what contract he roade with them. 10. Excuse this long epistle. I thought you would like to have all the facts before you. 4 . • r Enclosurei Copy of letter from Euhammed Taqi to Assistant Tolitical Agent•D.O.
