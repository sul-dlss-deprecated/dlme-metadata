CONFIDENTIAL. [March 10.] Section 1. [10989] No - L Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received March 10.) St. Petershuryh, March 5, 1913. IN the course of a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 1st of this month, I reverted to the question of the trans-Persian railway scheme, and said that it appeared from figures with which you had supplied me that the distance between Ispahan and Moscow was shorter by loO miles than that between Ispahan and Constantinople. There could, therefore, be no danger of the through European traffic being diverted to the Bagdad Railway, were our proposed alignment to be carried out. The northern route via Russia would, I also pointed out, be considerably shortened were goods for the European markets to be dispatched westwards from Rostof instead of being carried so far north as Moscow. His Excellency admitted the truth of the latter contention, hut said that though he was not in a position to affirm straight oh that the figures which I had given him were inaccurate, a study of the atlas had left on him an exactly contrary impiession. e was still, he continued, of the opinion that the railway ought to be carried more to the east and to pass by Yezd instead of Ispahan. I repeated what I had already said on a former occasion, that this would not by itself prevent the Bagdad Railway being eventually linked up with the trans-Persian railway. His Excellency would also no doubt remember that we had always made our approval of the latter scheme subject to certain conditions, of which the alignment was one, and that we had stated that the railway must in any case enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas. It was extremely doubtful whether the through traffic from and to Europe would contribute to any considerable extent to the success of the enterprise, and if British financiers were to be induced to co-operate, it was necessary to choose an alignment which by reason ol local conditions was likely to prove remunerative. The one which we had now proposed offered substantial local advantages, which would more than compensate for the increased length of the line, and I personally believed that it was the only practical one. | Persia was a thinly populated country, and it was impossible to fix the trace of the trans-Persian railway by drawing a straight line on the map from one town to another, as the Emperor Nicholas I. had done in the case of the St. I etersburgh Moscow Railway. On M. Sazonof remarking that in spite of this mode of procedure the latter railway was a most paying concern, 1 said that the conditions were entirely different, as in Russia the demand for railway accommodation was greater than the supply. As his Excellency still seemed inclined to insist on the advantages of keeping tne alignment at as great a distance as possible from the Bagdad Railway, I endeavoured to impress on him, as instructed by your telegram No. 17,. of the dbth ultimo that the best way to avoid an extension of the German railway system into 1 ersia was foi Gieat Britain and Russia to carry out with the least possible delay some well considered scheme of railway construction in that country. The one which you had now suggested seemed to me admirably suited for the purpose, and I therefore trusted that it would meet with his approval. His Excellency did not take exception to what 1 had said, but remarked that it might perhaps be well for us also to take in hand the construction of a line from Ispahan to Khorremabad. In the course of our subsequent conversation he even went so far as to say that perhaps the best plan would be for us to drop the larger scheme altogether and for Russia to construct a line to Tehran, while we might build some railway in the south. As I thought that this remark might have een prompted by a desire to.prevent our seaborne goods being carried northwaids o Ispahan and Tehran, I observed that the Persian Government was not likely to grant a concession for a line to Tehran except as part of a trunk line running down to the If In a conversation which I had with M. Sazonof yesterday I communicated to him the information contained in your telegram No. 176 of the 1st instant respecting the [2836 fc—1] r““ cot i SE 121 • 1 ;2 engineering difficulties which rendered the construction of a line from Khanikin to Ispahan most improbable. His Excellency said that he was very glad to hear this, and asked whether the Germans were aware of the difficulties with which they would have to contend should they attempt to construct such a line. I replied that this was a question which I could not answer. On m y enquiring when his Excellency would be in a position to discuss our proposals in detail, he said that he hoped to be able to do so in the course of next week. I no vp /Vp GEORGE W.

Mr. Greenway to Foreign Office.—(Received March 1.) Sir, Winchester House, Old Broad Street, February 27, 1913. WITH reference to my interview of the 25th instant with Sir Louis Mallet, I yesterday saw the Honourable Cecil Baring and Lord Errington with regard to the proposal that the Persian Railway Syndicate and the Societe d’Etude should in some way co-operate in respect of the proposed railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. We fully discussed the position of the various Persian railway schemes and 1 placed before them the following proposal:— 1. That they shall admit the Persian Railway Syndicate to a two-fifths participation in the five-ninths share which it is proposed that the British group shall hold in the southern section of the proposed trans-Persian railway. 2. That in consideration of this the Persian Railway Syndicate shall transfer to the Societe d’Etude their interest in the railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. 3. That as a further consideration, and also in order to secure a more complete consolidation of interests between the British group of the Societe d’Etude and ourselves, we should admit Messrs. Baring Brothers and their British associates to a one-third interest in the Persian Railway Syndicate by increasing the capital of the latter to 45,000L of which they would be allowed to subscribe one-third. I also explained to them the position and objects of the Persian Mining Syndicate and the connection between this syndicate and the Railway Syndicate, and offered to admit them to a one-third share in the former should they desire to take any participa tion in it. I pointed out to them that the proposals made by me in regard to the amalgamation J of our respective railway interests would give them an equal interest in the proposed purely British railways (viz.,Mohammerah to Khoremabad and Bunder Abbas to Kerman) to that which they now hold in the trans-Persian Syndicate, and, therefore that the ! arrangement was an advantageous one from all points of view, inasmuch as it would permit of the construction of railways in Southern Persia being proceeded with in the order of their importance and remunerative possibilities, without regard to the predominance of any particular British interests in any one line. They seemed to consider the proposals that I placed before them very[reasonable, and said that after consulting with their British colleagues they would let me know their views. I have, &amp;e. C.

You will w^ell appreciate that I did not feel justified at the time in addressing any questions to Lord Morley, especially as I felt in hearty agreement with the expediency of the broad lines of policy which he indicated as being that of His Majesty’s Government. I was particularly glad to hear his confirmation of what you were kind enough to tell me on Tuesday, to the effect that definite steps are contemplated for establishing law and order in Persia, as it is obvious that no kind of large financial operation can be carried to a successful issue until matters in that country have assumed a normal condition. If I had ventured to address any remarks to Lord Morley, I should have expressed my conviction that he would be the first to recognise that the formation of the Soeiete d’Etudes was agreed upon with the consent and approval of Great Britain and Russia, with the primary object of facilitating the study of a trans-Persian railway project, and with the further purpose of obtaining an option for ultimate construction ; and that the Societe d’Etudes, as such, has no pretensions to assume any responsibility as regards matters purely financial in Persia. You will notice in the enclosed report which I have cut out from yesterday’s “ Times” it is suggested that “'negotiations and operations are now going on between the Persian Government and the Societe d’Etudes.” This, as you are well aware, would hardly seem to be an accurate representation of the present position of the Societe d’Etudes. Moreover, it occurs to me that the mention of actual figures, which may possibly prove wholly disproportionate to the security at present available in Persia, is likely to give rise to hopes which appear to have but meagre chances of early realisation. The second point underlined* in the cutting which I enclose is of really vital importance from the practical point of view, as personally I consider that the formation of some kind of “ caisse ” or “ board of control ” is a sine qua non, if some satisfactory security is to be created for the service of any loan which may be made upon the hypothecation of the resources of the country itself. There must be some machinery of sufficient power and authority to control Persian finances and to control them effectively ; and if I may venture an opinion, I should be inclined to say that the confidence of European markets can only be commanded by direct Anglo-Russian representation in the Persian administration. I feel confident that both Lord Morley and yourself will well appreciate the diffidence which I felt in venturing to address any questions to him the night before last, but I feel equally sure that you will also forgive my losing no time in drawing attention to the above points, as I should be the first to deprecate any misapprehension in the mind of the public or in that of His Majesty’s Ministers as to the actual position of the Societe d’Etudes.

The Position in Persia. with reference to the present position of affairs in Persia, having special reference (1) to * Printed in italics.the granting of a loan; (2) to the financial administration; and (3) to the strengthening- of the gendarmerie. He said that a stalement had recently appeared in the press that a loan of 400,000L was going to he made to Persia jointly by Great Britain and Bussia. He hoped that was true. He understood that commnnications had been in progress concerning railway concessions. No doubt it was desirable that the terms of those concessions should be finally agreed upon before money was advanced, but once the terms had been settled he trusted that there would be no delay in granting the loan. He wished to know whether any undertaking had been given by the Persian Govern ment as to the application of the loan, and whether some better form of financial administration would be set up in Tehran. In his opinion it would be very desirable to establish there a treasury board or an advisory council, consisting, for example, of a Russian, a Britisher, and a Persian, or a representative of some neutral Power, to see that the money w r as properly applied. Mr. Shuster had said that Persia could give security for a loan of 4,000,000b or 5,000,000b No doubt a considerable part of that loan would be earmaked for the purposes of the gendarmerie. He had on a previous occasion expressed his admiration of the work of the Swedish officers in perfecting that force; but he asked the Government to consider the desirability of introducing some British officers from India who were familiar with natives and native troops and with the language. He had never advocated sending a military expedition to Persia, nor did he wish to give the Russian Government any excuse for increasing their powers in Northern Persia; but he thought that the Persian gendarmerie might well be strengthened by lending a number of British officers not to displace, but to assist the Swedish officers in increasing the gendarmerie and making it more efficient. Viscount Morley said he was very glad that the noble lord saw the problem on the whole in much the same light as did the Government. What he had said about the Persian gendarmerie with Swedish officers was perfectly true, and it was valuable to have the recognition of an undisputed friend of Persian nationality like the noble lord taking that view. In December last one of the Government’s leading agents had a long conversation with the commandant of the Swedish officers, who said that he had now a very considerable staff of Persian officers and non-commissioned officers at his disposal in an efficient state of preparation ; but he would like to have 300 or 400 more men if the necessary funds were forthcoming. The commandant had at hand ample material for an instructor class, which would create a larger force if the funds needed were obtained. The noble lord was not quite accurate when he said nothing had been advanced to Persia. The matter of the murder of Captain Eckford was a terrible and deplorable incident in the great road problem it was incumbent upon us to solve, because we were more interested than any other Power in the trade on the great southern road. After that incident the Government could no doubt have sent a punitive expedition and have undertaken the duty of policing the road and restoring at least a superficial semblance of order. But there were enormous objections to sending a punitive expedition, and it was not a course for which the Government could make themselves responsible. Experience ebowed only too abundantly that it was very easy to take the first step in a movement of that kind, but very hard to end it. The noble lord would see that for this country to have undertaken the pacification of the southern road and its regeneration from its present abominable condition would be really to impair the authority of the Persian Government; and with a view to giving the Persian Government the best chance we could, we should abstain from any move of a military or semi-military kind which would involve us in obligations not only irksome to ourselves but extremely disadvantageous to the Persian Government, in whom we were interested. The Gendarmerie. Ihen the noble lord asked whether the Government were considering the expediency of adding to the gendarmerie a leaven of British officers from India. Very little reconsideration would, he thought, convince the noble lord that that would be a very risky proceeding, because the Swedish officers were undertaking a veiy unwelcome responsibility, and it ay on Id be a very risky operation to add to the force another foreign element. Those who Avere best able to judge had warned the Government that the introduction of these officers would be most likely to lead to friction and jealousy. Ihe difficulties which Avould arise seemed to His Majesty’s Government to justify the rejection of the proposal of the noble lord. None of the reforms desired in Persia- could take place Avitkout money. It Avas proposed to raise 400,000b more, 200,000b in Great Britain and 200,000b in Russia. The expenditure of that 400,000b, and also anothei 100,000/.. to be raised in Great Britain alone for the special case of the3 Government of Fars, would be framed in consultation with the Swedish commandant, and then it would be submitted to the Governor-General of Fars, and some portion of it would be used for his own personal government and the rest would be handed over ^ monthly payments of 8,000b to the commandant. It was hoped that in a year the gendarmerie could be relied on for the maintenance of order. The security for these advances was to be looked for in a large loan of four, five, or six millions. They must / look for such a loan in connection with the negotiations and operations now going onT between the Persian Government and the Societe d’Etudes, and there seemed to be some/ reason for looking forward to a successful ending by-and-by to these negotiations. Aj financial board to supersede M. Mon&amp;hd would impair the authority and independence ofi* the Persian Government, as it would take away the management and control of the mainspring of government. His Majesty’s Government did not share the noble lord’s doubts as to the capacity or good-will of M. Mor-ahd to make the best of his arduous task. Lord' Newton said that the policy of the Government appeared to be leading precisely in the diiection they wished to avoid. He could not imagine anything more likely to bring about a punitive expedition than the present state of things. It was all very well to talk about the independence of the Persian Government; but the truth was the Persian Government were absolutely impotent in that part of the world, and it was impossible to re-establish order or to obtain redress. He did not think the noble viscount or his colleagues realised what the situation was.i HV 1 - [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.! 1 1 f [B] 1 ^ i o J PERSIA.

ENCLOSED is a memorandum referring to some of the points raised in conver sation about Persian affairs at the Foreign Office on the 18th February. I trust you will find this resume in accordance with your recollections of the main features of the discussion.

Yours very sincerely, ERRINGTON. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Conversation at the Foreign Office on February 18, 1913. Present: Sir Arthur Nicolson, Lord Eevelstoke, and Lord Erriimton. SIR A. NICOLSON opened the conversation by referring io the Foreign Office letter of the 4th February. Lord Eevelstoke replied that his letter had been duly received and considered by the British group of the Societe d’Etudes, whose reply should reach Downing Street in the course of the next few hours. Lord Eevelstoke then said that, although he had not personally been present at the meeting of the British group last Monday, he gathered that the impression left on the minds of its members was that the last communication from the Foreign Office was tantamount to extinguishing the trans-Persian railway project as such. It was further pointed out that the alignment now indicated to the British group by the Foreign Office could not be considered as a clear line to the sea-coast, inasmuch as a concession for the last section of this alignment (i.e., Shiraz to Bunder Abbas) was understood to be claimed by other parties. To this Sir Arthur demurred, saying that, without reference to documents, his impression was that the alignment suggested was a “ clear line.” It was, however, agreed that this point should be elucidated through the official correspondence still in progress with the Societe d’Etudes. Lord Eevelstoke then explained that it would be desirable to communicate to the Eussian and French groups in the societe the latest correspondence between the British group and the Foreign Office, as, for instance, Sir L. Mallets letter of the 4th instant and the reply. Sir Arthur agreed that this course would be advisable, and added that he did not apprehend any objection to such a step, more especially^ as communications were to be made to the Eussian Government, who would doubtless keep the Eussian group informed. Persian Loan. Setting aside the question of railways, Sir Arthur Nicolson then said he w r as anxious to talk about the financial aspect of affairs in Persia He explained that from the side of the British and Indian Governments every disposition had been shown to act on the lines discussed in London in October last, namely, to advance 1,000,000b jointly with Eussia from Government sources to assist the Persian Government in re-establishing order. Much opposition had, however, been encountered from Eussian quarters owing to the difficulty in that country of making cash advances for special purposes of this nature. Agreement had, nevertheless, been reached, and a joint advance for a total sum of 400,000b was to be made to the Persian Government for general purposes.” From this total some 30,000/. out of the amount contributed by Great Britain was to be [2804 x—3] 13 COPY '-o I M ‘‘MA 14 MAR 1913 SECRETARY'S N- 1 I !earmarked for special purposes in the south. The Russian Government were indifferent to independent financial steps taken by the Bnteh ^ the stipulated that advances to the Central Government at Tehian should not exceed the Arthur explained that a speciaUoan of 100,0001 was to be made from Bntish-Indian funds to the Governor General of Ears in order to establish order and security on the trade routes. It was hoped that the employment of forces organised by the Persians themselves would serve the purposes of re-establishing law and order m the disturbed regions, and that this would obviate the necessity of military measures on a larger scale winch &amp; t otherwise have to be undertaken by British-Indian foices. . •• With such results as, it was hoped, would be obtained by these measures, and with such guarantee for better administration as the present Persian Government seemed to promise, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran it was hoped by the Foreign Office that the Societe d’Etudes would shortly be able to dispatch their delegates to Tehran to examine the financial position of Persia and to report on To J this Lord Bevelstoke replied that the primary object of the delegates visiting Persia was to obtain a concession for a trans-Persian railway, and the financial question was always considered as entirely separate from that of the railway. If, therefore, the railway project was to be curtailed, amended, or modined m sue a fashion as no longer to appeal to the various interests in the Societe d Etudes, Lord Bevelstoke did not see how the dispatch of delegates could be justified to the promoters of the societd. Considerable expenditure had already been incurred without much prospect of return. ^ _ . Another reason for hesitation was that the principle of lending money to Persia had never actually been laid before the Societe d Etudes as.a whole, although ceitain financial interests in this body in London and Paris had at times icferred to the matter. _ _ . . The question of financing Persia under the conditions at present obtaining there and on the European markets hardly admitted of serious consideration. ^ Lord Bevel stoke at the same time fully recognised the difficulties of the situation, and was anxious to place his services unreservedly at the disposal of the Foreign Office if they considered he could be of any assistance towards finding a solution of the problem. In his opinion, the first question was that of the conditions under which any financial delegates were to proceed to Persia. The cost would be considerable, and it would be difficult to justify the societe dispatching delegates to Persia for purely financial investigations, especially should that body, rightly or wrongly, consider their railway projects as put aside by the British Government. The most reasonable solution to the first stage in the financial problem would therefore seem to be that delegates sent to Persia should proceed under Government auspices, and that no charges in this connection should fall upon the Societe d’Etudes so long as purely financial investigations were pursued. Before leaving, Lord Bevelstoke mentioned that he was going over to Paris next week, and suggested that, before proceeding there, it would be useful to learn the Foreign Office views on the trans-Persian railway and loan questions. Sir Arthur therefore suggested that conversations should be resumed on Tuesday, the 25th February, after the Foreign Office had had an opportunity of studying Sir William Garstin’s latest letter.

Mr. Stuart (War Office) to Mr. Campbell.—(Received February 27.) My dear Campbell, War Office, February 27, 1913. REFERENCE your query of Tuesday afternoon last, “Is a railway line from Khanikin to Ispahan feasible from the engineering point of view by alternative alignments—(a) in the Russian sphere ; (b) in the neutral sphere ; and (c) partly in both the Russian and neutral spheres.” I can find nothing to show that the tract of country in question has ever been examined with a view to railway construction between Khanikin neighbourhood and Ispahan. From the information available in the maps, military reports, and route books which I have been able to consult, and in the absence of any report on the country from the technical railway point of view, it is only possible to give a general opinion on the points of reference for what it is worth. The region in question is one of the most mountainous in Persia, and the mountain ranges have a marked trend from north-west to south-east; any railway from Khanikin to Ispahan must ascend the Persian plateau and more or less cut across these ranges. The region in the Russian sphere (north of line Kasr-i-Shirin-Ispahan) is better populated, more fertile, and better watered than the neutral sphere region; the physical difficulties to be encountered also seem to be less formidable. Railway construction from Khanikin to Ispahan in either sphere would be a difficult and costly undertaking, and maintenance of a line would be expensive. A technical and more detailed examination would be necessary to say whether a railway would be economically feasible under the conditions. Subject to the above remarks, it would seem that probably a route feasible for a railway could be found somewhat on the following general alignment, practically all in the Russian sphere :— Khanikin - Kasr-i-Shirin - Kermanshah - neighbourhood of Hamadan (perhaps branching off east about Kangavar)-Sultanabad-Ispahan. Such alignment has the advantage that from Kangavar on to Ispahan it conforms to the natural trend of the mountain ranges ; snowfall in winter might be a difficulty in certain places. It appears that any alignment in the Russian sphere south of the above (e.g., south-east from Kermanshah) would encounter great physical difficulties. No alignment partly in the Russian and partly in the neutral sphere seems feasible. In the neutral sphere, even taking a roundabout alignment to the south, I do not think any alignment will be found that would be feasible except at^mmense cost. To sum up, therefore—always subject to my introductory remarks—I think that a feasible, though costly, route could be found within the Russian sphere, but that probably no alignment, feasible without prohibitive cost, could be found in the neutral sphere.

He seemed to doubt whether they would accept it, and said that he personally thought that, in view of the protracted negotiations that were likely to ensue, we should have to separate the question of the loan from the railway scheme, as otherwise the Persian Government might have to wait indefinitely for the money they needed.

What his Excellency wishes to avoid has already been sacrificed by the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. Moreover, a line taking British goods north would also bring Russian goods south. If M.

There would be no objection here, but it would be better to obtain the option in order to prevent its falling into other hands.

(Signed) Errington Sir Louis Mallet, K.C.B., Foreign Office, S.W.1 11 &lt; Memorandum on the Foreign Office letter No. 7681 of 24th February, 1913. TRANS-PERSIAN RAILWAY. The purport of the above mentioned letter was discussed last weeK at a meeting of the British Group of the Societe Internationale d*Etudes ciu Chemin ae fer Transpersan. While the main lines of policy which His Majesty's Government desire to lay down appear established and have been communicated to the British Group for their guidance in negotiating with French and Russian inter ests for a working arrangement in a Trans-Persian Railway scheme, there would seem to be several ques tions of principle and detail which may militate i against the satisfactory conclusion of an agreement. It is felt therefore that in view of the possi bility of an early meeting of the Rociete d*Etudes in Paris, the points of difficulty might with advantage be discussed between representatives of the British Group and a representative of the Foreign Office and i Board of Trade during the course of this week in order to arrive at a clearer understanding of the British Government *sGovernment’s views. There are many questions of principle which the Societe d*Etudes as a whole must discuss before any indications can usefully be given as to their views, but the following points appear to demand settlement before negotiations can proceed in Pans. (1) Assuming the Trans-Persian Pailway to be one concession from Astara to the sea (i.e. Bunder-Abbas) cari through communication with India be looked to by the inclusion in an international line of the section from Bunder-Aobas to the Baluchistan frontier (say Guattar). The construction of this extension of the international line being naturally subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government as to time and alignment. (2) Assuming a single concession for the whole alignment from Astara to Bunder-Abbas and perhaps eventually on to Guattar, would His Majesty’s Govern ment view with favour the principle of the revenue and expenditure on the Northern and Southern Sections of the line being amalgamated. ( 3 ) The division of the concession into two com paniescompanies presupposes a separate capital for each ctf the two companies. This would militate against the principle of amalgamating receipts. (4fe)T w ° companies would not easily work in co operation without the establishment of a central board. In the central board would therefore be vested the chief control over the whole enterprise. Limitations to the powers of the Central Board would stultify its object. The composition of the Central board would neces sarily be on a basis of equality of representation in nationalities. This might result in control passing out of the hands of the parties most directly interested in one or other section of the line. Division of capital between two subsidiary com panies would not easily be adjusted owing to discrepancy in mileage, expenditure ana receipts. i{) The ingenious theory for the distribution of capital whereby Treat Britain, France and Russia should each have an equal proportional share in the enterprise as a whole assumes the willingness on the part of Russia to treat the Northern Sphere ol Persia in the same fashion as it is proposed to treat the Neutral SphereSphere. At the sa.rr£ time international rights are excluded from the British Sphere, unless the Bunder- Abbas-Guattar section is to be comprised in the Trans-Persian Concession. The admission of international rights in the Northern section is nevertheless to be solicited from Russia. (5) While admitting French 'rights' to mean one third share of the capital and not absolute equality with each of the other two participating countries, the British Group desire to learn definitely whether His Majesty's Government intend to exclude the French Group from participating in the 'technical and industrial sections' and also in the 'construction' arrangements as well as in the orders for 'material and supplies' required for an international line? The foregoing are some of the points which occur to the British Group as requiring early discussion and for this purpose it is submitted that a meeting might be arranged on Wednesday next - March 5th - at such a place and hour as may be indicated by the Departments concerned. 3rd March, 1913.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] [A] PERSIA.

I am now to refer seriatim to the points enumerated in your letter • (a.) You submit that, “ having stipulated for Government control, and insisted on an alignment suited to political requirements,” His Majesty’s Government should not at the same time exclude the possibility of financial assistance in the future. I am to point out that the expression “ Government control ” in this reference does not appear to be altogether borne out by the terms of my letter of the 4th February, whereas the alteration of the alignment to one “ suited to political requirements conveys an inadequate idea of what has in effect been suggested, since the alteration in question would result in the line being diverted from an arid desert to a region which is relatively populous, and therefore more suited for railway enterprise. Such being the case, Sir E. Grey fails to appreciate why the circumstances to which you allude should render a British Government guarantee more necessary; indeed, he is rather led to the opposite conclusion. . In regard to this point, Sir E. Grey would recall to you the following sentence in my letter of the 23rd November :— “While Sir E. Grey cannot but regard the question as somewhat premature, he recognises that, if railways are built in regions adjacent to those tiaversed by the line you have in view, then means should be found for securing through traffic, destined to pass on to, or coming from, your system, against unfair manipulation on lailways outside your direct control.” I am to add that the desire of His Majesty’s Government is to promote co-opera tion amongst British commercial interests in Persia.

Garstin. feir ’ . _ Foreign Office, February 24, 1913. UjN receipt of your letter of the 15th January ou the subject of the mter-group agreement in regard to the Trans-Persian Railway, and in particular the additional declaration desired by the French group, Sir E. Grey forthwith caused the points at issue to be referred for expert opinion to the Board of Trade. The matter was obviously one requiring careful consideration, for the wording of a technical document of this nature may not improbably affect the larger question of actual control over various portions of the line. It is obsei ved that the draft declaration, enclosed in your letter of the 15th January, is to the effect that the agreement between the Russian and British groups, which formed enclosuie B m your letter of the 20th Becember, does not modify in any respect the rights of the drench group as they result from the international agreement as to principle, the agreements annexed thereto, and the statutes of the Societe d’Etudes. The international agreement lays down that:— The realisation of the trans-Persian line connecting the Russian system with the Indo-British system shall be undertaken by mutual consent, by an international group composed of Russian, French, and English elements upon a footing of equality. The rights of the owners of shares of the Societe d’Etudes, of which mention is made hereinafter, such as they shall be defined by, and result from, the constitution of the Societe d’Etudes, shall extend subsequently in the same proportions to all companies which may be formed with the object of rendering effectively valuable the concessions secured m view of the construction of the said line or concessions arising out of or connected with the working of the same. The group is agreed to request the Societe d’Etudes to recommend the companies to be formed as above, to acquire the assistance of the technical elements of their choice on the basis of the equal distribution above mentioned, this basis being equally applicable to the technical and industrial sections, to the construction and to the material and supplies.” The application of the principle thus formulated would necessitate an equal participation of the three national groups in any companies which may be formed for the construction or working of any portions of the proposed line or of any branches thereof. You will recall that, in my letter of the 4th February, it is stated that the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the_ project of a trans-Persian railway is subject to the conditions, inter alia, that “ British control must predominate in the southern or Gulf section of any trans-Persian line, or of the branches, wdiich may be made, and that this control shall not be invalidated by any arrangement which may be made in regard to the percentage of other (i.e., non-British) participation in the undertaking.” These stipulations, to which His Majesty’s Government attach paramount importance, are undoubtedly at variance with the literal text of the international agreement as to principle quoted above ; they do not, however, appear to necessitate any practical diminution of the right of the French group under that agreement to one third participation in the capital of any company formed to work concessions. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government consider that any declaration, such as that forming the enclosure in your letter of the 15th January, should be so worded as to make it clear that the “ rights of the French group ” referred to therein mean the right to one-third share of the capital and not to absolute equality with each of the other two participating countries. For the confidential information of your group I am to state that it has been [2804 aa —1!suggested to Sir E. Grey that a plan for overcoming the difficulty m question might be as follows :— 1 et the Trans-Persian Railway, from Astara to the sea, be one concession, but let the actlniJ/brcSstVucted and^perated in two actions by two c e _or kl in co-operation Russian interests predominating on the northern section, ntisti oiy th© 0 southern° while the relative interests of the three Powers in he enterprise as a^ •i.«. .-t— 'tfsjs sm'Lt;« —— Northern Southern Railway as Section.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant. The British group welcome the clear statement therein contained of the opinions of His Majesty’s Government on certain points submitted for their consideration on the 9th December last. At the same time it is evident to them that if the views now expressed are maintained the lines of the original project for an international trans- Persian railway will have been so materially altered that none of the advantages anticipated from the through connection with India can now be reckoned upon in support of the scheme. Such departure from the original idea of direct rail communication between India and Europe will necessarily require full discussion with their French and Russian associates in the Societe d’Etudes. Before even this step is taken it would seem imperative to ascertain the extent to which British railway interests in Southern Persia are capable of consolidation, as it is only after settlement of this question that an international agreement can satisfactorily be reached. The extent and nature of participation which, with the consent of the British Government, should be offered to foreign interests over the main trunk line (running from the Russo-Persian frontier to Bunder Abbas via Shiraz) can then be determined. Dealing separately with the points of }'our letter under reply, I venture to advance the following considerations :— As to (a), the British group note the clearly expressed assent of His Majesty’s Government to the principle of a trans-Persian railway project, but they desire to emphasise the fact that the conditions now imposed by the British Government are tantamount to converting the original Indo-European project into one mainly intended for the development of railway enterprise in Southern Persia. In these circumstances they would submit that, having stipulated for Government control, and insisted on an alignment suited to political requirements, His Majesty’s Government should not at the same time exclude the possibility of financial assistance in the future. In regard to (b), the British group are glad to learn that their co-operation in the Societe d’Etudes is still considered desirable on general grounds. They note that His Majesty’s Government hold themselves already engaged to support other interests in the following concessions :— 1. Mohammerah-Khoremabad. 2. Bunder Abbas-Kerman. 3. “ Certain lines in the neutral sphere.” With regard to (2), the British group are naturally much concerned to find that His Majesty’s Government consider themselves committed in such a way as might render an important section of territory—one, moreover, vital to any trans-continental scheme—tributary to competing interests. As to (3), these last-mentioned lines remain unspecified, and until the British group have learnt what they are, and been satisfied that they do not interfere with the completion of the main alignment now suggested for adoption, they cannot usefully enter into discussion with other parties, British or foreign. With regard to the statement that “ His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to recommend to the parties interested in the projects in the neutral sphere that it would serve British interests if they would join with the British group of the Societe d’Etudes,” the British group would be glad to know who are the parties interested in the projects referred to by the Foreign Office. [2804 £—1]III*' ' S i Information on this head would enable the British group to appreciate the value to be attached to any expression of views which the parties in question may desire to In conclusion, the British group note that the approval of His Majesty s Govern ment is accorded to the text of the proposed letter to the Persian Government, subject f to the modification of wording suggested in your letter under reply, which, on lesuming ^ communications with their French and Russian associates, they will submit for their consideration. The absence of any further mention of the texts of the proposed inter-group agreement (enclosed in my letter of the 20th December, 1912), and of the proposed declaration desired by the French group (enclosed in my letter of the 15th ultimo), leads the British group to assume that these documents also have the approval of the f oreign Office.

Foreign Office to Sir W. E. Garstin. ® ir » . ) Foreign Office, February 4, 1913. HIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the letters which you addressed to this Department on the 9th and 20th December on the subject of the Trans-Persian Railway project. _ In your letter of the 9th December, while recognising that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government had hitherto been to reserve complete freedom of action pending submission of the survey you were to furnish, you intimate that you do not now feel justified in sending a delegate to Tehran to negotiate, in concert with French and Russian associates, with the Persian Government; and, before proceeding further, you ask that indications may be afforded to you on the following points :— (a.) It would seem essential to learn whether His Majesty’s Government view with favour or disfavour the prospect of direct railway communication between India and Europe via Russia. (&amp;.) It would appear desirable to know whether His Majesty’s Government desire British financial interests to continue co-operation in the Soci^tb d’Ptudes in spite of such co-operation leading primarily to facilitating railway construction in Northern Persia only. (c.) In the event of His Majesty’s Government being already committed to support other applicants for railway concessions in the British and neutral spheres, it would seem essential to learn the scope of such concessions. (d.) In view of the possible advancement of conflicting projects for railway service in the British and neutral spheres, the British group would be glad to learn whether His Majesty’s Government have any suggestions as to a solution of the situation which may arise from rival claims in this portion of Persian territory. I am now directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to make the following observations on each of these points :— {a.) His Majesty’s Government have already expressed themselves prepared to assent in principle to the project of a Trans-Persian railway: that assent is made subject to the following, among other, conditions :— That no part of the line or its connections shall be constructed outside the Russian sphere until, and in such measures as, His Majesty’s Government shall consider it politic and feasible ; that the main line must pass through Ispahan by Shiraz, and if it, or any branch, is continued to the British sphere, it must reach that sphere at Bunder Abbas ; that His Majesty’s Government do not think that the time has yet come for a connection between Bunder Abbas and Karachi to be made, and as there must be no question of making it until His Majesty’s Government consider that the time has come when it is desirable, the question of branch and local lines should be considered on their merits, and their commercial advantages should not be sacrificed to the project of through connection ; that His Majesty’s Government undertake no financial guarantee in regard to the project; that the point where the line touches the Persian Gulf shall be referred to His Majesty’s Government when the surveys have been completed, and the arrangements for the maritime terminus, and for its control, shall be submitted to their approval; that the question of the gauge outside the Russian sphere shall be submitted to His Majesty’s Government; that effective means must be provided, to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government, to secure British trade against differential treatment of any kind, direct or indirect, on any railway constructed under a concession obtained by the Societe d’Etudes ; that British control must predominate in the Southern or Gulf section of any Trans-Persian line, or of the branches, which may be made, and that this control shall not be invalidated by any arrangement which may be made in regard to the percentage of other (i.e., non- British) participation in the undertaking. (6.) His Majesty’s Government raise no objection, regarding it as very desirable on general grounds that the British group should co-operate in the Societe d’Etudes, but they trust that such progress may be made in regard to a well-considered scheme [2804 d—1]2 of railway development in the south as will render possible an early, and if possible simultaneous, start in construction from the Persian Gulf. (c.) That His Majesty’s Government are committed, and were so before the constitution of the Societe d’Etudes: that the concessions in question are the B under- Abbas-lverman one in the British sphere (which would have to be purely^ British-controlled), and certain lines in the neutral sphere (other than the Mohammerah- •/ Khorremmabad project) which, in view of the great predominance of British trade, should be preponderatingly British, though not without a substantial international participation both in construction and management. (d.) His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to recommend to the parties interested in the projects (other than the Mohammerah-Khorremmabad line) in the neutral sphere that it would serve British interests if they would join with the British group of the Societe d’Etudes, who, in consultation with His Majesty’s Government, might then arrange the degree and nature of the foreign participation in question. I am to express Sir E. Grey’s view that the arrangements for securing British control on certain portions of the line need not necessarily conflict with the principle of equal representation of British, Russian, and French interests in the undertaking from the northern frontier of Persia to the sea. In conclusion, I am to state that, subject to the acceptance of the conditions laid down, His Majesty’s Government are willing to support your Societe in the negotiations proposed at Tehran; but that they would recommend the substitution of the words “ d’un chemin de fer traversant la Perse du nord au sud par Teheran” for the words “sur territoire persan, &amp;c., &amp;c., .... par Teheran ” in the note which you propose to address to the Persian Government (see enclosure A in your letter of the 20th December).

While admitting the latter contention, his Excellency expressed some incredulity as to the correctness of our calculations, and said that he would have the figures looked into. I then once more reverted to the advantages of our alignment, pointing out that as the projected railway must in any case enter our sphere at Bunder Abbas it would be impossible to induce British financiers to co-operate in building what must prove an unproductive railway through the desert by Yezd when there was a far better, though somewhat longer, alternative route by Ispahan. One could not, I said, in a thinly populated country like Persia fix alignment, as had been done in the case of St. Petersburgh-Moscow Railway, by drawing a straight line from one town to another. Though I could not get him to commit himself to acceptance of our proposal, he showed himself far less hostde to it than on the last occasion. On my remarking that the best way to block German railway extension would be for us to co-operate in carrying out at once the scheme you had proposed, he merely said it might be well were we to undertake the construction of a line from Ispahan to Khoremabad. He even _ once suggested that we might drop the larger scheme altogether, and that Russia might construct line to Tehran while we constructed some line in the south. As I gathered that his object in suggesting this was to prevent our sea-borne goods being brought north, I remarked that Persian Government might refuse concession for the line to Tehran except as part of a trunk line to the south. I hardly think it is likely that he will put forward such a proposal seriously, but if he does, what line do you wish me to take up ? I will act on your telegram No. 176 / on the first opportunity.

Foreign Office, February 27, 1913, 1‘30 p.m. OUR consent to the Trans-Persian sclieme was, from the first, confined to approval in principle, subject to various conditions, of which one was the alignment. The alignment we have now recommended is one which will tap and develop a more prolific region, and, inasmuch as it is extremely doubtful if through traffic from Europe would in any case contribute largely to the financial success of the enterprise, it seems altogether unwise to sacrifice to it substantial local advantages. As the line must, in any case, enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas, the present alignment is far preferable to an alignment direct from Yezd to Bunder Abbas, which would pass through unprofitable country. But surely the contention of the ~~ vRussian Minister for Foreign Affairs, as described in the penultimate paragraph of 'Ay your despatch NoTTojis based on a miscalculation of distances. The railway distance &gt;1 . from Ostend to Moscow is rather less than that from Ostend to Constantinople ; the distance from Moscow to Ispahan, via Tehran, would be roughly 1,750 miles, and from Ispahan to Constantinople, via Konia, Sadijeh, and Khanikin, about 1,900 miles. 1 am convinced that the best way to avoid an extension of the German system into Persia is for Great Britain and Russia to carry out, without undue delay, a well-considered scheme of railway co-operation in Persia, and you should emphasise this aspect of question in conversation with Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 24.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, February 20, J913. ON the receipt of your telegram No. 1J6 of the 11th instant, I communicated to M. Sazonof verbally the general outline of the views of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the trans-Persian railway scheme, and left with him an aide-memoire, embodying the contents of your despatch No. 64 of the 5th instant, together with a copy of the letter to Sir W. Garstin, that formed the enclosure in that despatch. M. Sazonof received my communication with apparent satisfaction, and said that he would give the documents which I had handed him his careful attention. The only point to which he took exception was the condition laid down by His Majesty’s Govern ment that the main line must pass through Ispahan and Shiraz, and if continued to the British sphere reach that sphere at Bunder Abbas. In proposing such an align ment His Majesty’s Government were, he contended, playing into the hands of the Germans, who would at once link up the Bagdad Railway with the trans-Persian railway by a branch line from Khanikin to Ispahan, The effect of this would be that all the through traffic, instead of being carried over the Russian railways, would be diverted to the. Bagdad Railway. The alignment ought to be made, as was originally proposed, much more to the east, and should pass through Yezd instead of Ispahan. I remarked that even if this was done it would not exclude the possibility of the Bagdad Railway being eventually linked up with the trans-Persian line, as were the Germans ever to obtain the concession for a line from Khanikin to Ispahan they would probably later on get it extended to Yezd. M. Sazonof replied that there was no reason why we should make matters easier for the Germans by selecting an alignment that was so much nearer to Khanikin. The question, he said, was such an , important one that it would hardly be in his competence to settle it by himself. He would therefore probably have to submit it to the Council of Ministers ; and he enquired what His Majesty’s Government would do should the decision of the Russian Government be unfavourable to the proposed alignment, I expressed the hope that this would not be the case. The advantages of the route which we proposed were self-evident. Instead of passing through a desert country, where there was no opening for traffic, the railway would be carried through important trade centres ; and the chances of its being worked with profit would consequently be increased. It would, moreover, exercise a beneficial and civilising influence in those districts and facilitate the restoration of order in south Persia, M. Sazonof merely replied that so far as our trade interests were concerned, we had the proposed Mohammerah-Khoremabad line, and that that ought to satisfy us. I suggested that his Excellency should, after examining with his competent advisers the various points raised in the papers which I had given him, discuss the whole question again with me before committing himself to a written reply, as I could then ask you for further explanations on any of those points that required elucidation. If he could not himself give the necessary time for a detailed discussion of the question I should be happy to receive M. Klemm, the head of the Persian department, at any time that suited his convenience. M. Sazonof said that he would certainly have another conversation with me before he drew up his written reply. From several things which he said in the course of our discussion I took away the impression that M. Sazonof is very sceptical as to the trans-Persian railway scheme being carried out in its entirety for years to come, and that the only interest that he really takes in the enterprise is the construction of the railway as far as lehran. Since writing the above I have had an opportunity of repeating to M. Sazonof what you said in your telegram No. 149 of the 17th of this month, and I again expressed the hope that he would not raise difficulties about the alignment proposed by His Majesty’s Government. His Excellency, who had evidently been thinking over the [2804 aa — 2] [^™T7T F • ; / ) r i U 28 FEB 1913 28 FEimatter since I last spoke to him, said that this proposal completely transformed the original character of the trans-Persian railway scheme. That scheme contemplated a direct transit railway through Persia to India, whereas, what we now proposed was to break this direct railway and make it follow a circuitous route that would add ^ enormously to its length It was, in fact, a scheme for a I eisian system of railways^ running from north to south. I endeavoured to convince him that the increased length would he more than compensated for by its passing through districts that would render it a remunerative undertaking, but he declined to admit this, and said that he doubted very much if a line from Shiraz to Ispahan would pay. He then reverted once more to the danger of bringing the line within reach of the Bagdad Railway, and, producing a map, pointed out how much shorter the route to Europe would be over that railway than through Russia. On my remarking that goods would have to break bulk at Constantinople, his Excellency replied that this difficulty could easily be got over by means of a ferry. If I have rightly understood his Excellency, he contends that our proposed align ment kills the original scheme of a direct transit railway from Europe to India via Russia and north Persia, and prepares the way for the construction of such a railway via Turkey, the Bagdad Railway, and south Persia. So far as I can see, it is difficult to dispute his contention that were the Germans to extend the Bagdad Railway to Ispahan, and were a line to be eventually constructed from that place to Shiraz, Bunder Abbas, and the Indian frontier, they would command the most direct route between Europe and India. As I foresee that our proposal will meet with strong opposition here, I should be grateful if I could be furnished by telegraph with such arguments as you can suggest, for the purpose of overcoming his Excellency’s objections.

Foreign Office to Sir W. Garstin. / Sir, Foreign Office, February 24, 1913. ON receipt of your letter of the 15th January on the subject of the inter-group agreement in regard to the Trans-Persian Railway, and in particular the additional declaration desired by the French group, Sir E. Grey forthwith caused the points at issue to be referred for expert opinion to the Board of Trade. The matter was obviously one requiring careful consideration, for the wording of a technical document of this nature may not improbably affect the larger question of actual control over various portions of the line. It is observed that the draft declaration, enclosed in your letter of the 15th January, is to the effect that the agreement between the Russian and British groups, which formed enclosure B in your letter of the 20th December, does not modify in any respect the rights of the French group as they result from the international agreement as to principle, the agreements annexed thereto, and the statutes of the Societe d’Etudes. The international agreement lays down that:— “ The realisation of the trans-Persian line connecting the Russian system with the Indo-British system shall be undertaken by mutual consent, by an international group composed of Russian, h rench, and English elements upon a footing of equality. “ The rights of the owners of shares of the Societe d’Etudes, of which mention is made hereinafter, such as they shall be defined by, and result from, the constitution of the Societe d’Etudes, shall extend subsequently in the same proportions to all companies which may be formed with the object of rendering effectively valuable the concessions secured in view of the construction of the said line or concessions arising out of or connected with the working of the same. “ The group is agreed to request the Societe d’Etudes to recommend the companies to be formed as above, to acquire the assistance of the technical elements of their choice on the basis of the equal distribution above mentioned, this basis being equally applicable to the technical and industrial sections, to the construction and to the material and supplies.” The application of the principle thus formulated would necessitate an equal participation of the three national groups in any companies which maj- be formed for the construction or working of any portions of the proposed line or of any blanches thereof. . . You will recall that, in my letter of the 4th February, it is stated that the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the project of a trans-Persian railway is subject to the conditions, inter aha, that British control must predominate in the southern or Gulf section of any trans-Persian line, or of the branches, wdiich may be made, and that this control shall not be invalidated by any arrangement which may be made Jn regard to the percentage of other {i.e., non-British) participation in the undertaking. These stipulations, to which His Majesty s Government attach paramount importance, are undoubtedly at variance with the literal text of the international agreement as to principle quoted above ; they do not, however, appeal to necessitate any practical diminution of the right of the 4 rench group under that agreement to one third participation in the capital of any company formed to work concessions. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Glovernment consider that anj declaration, such as that forming the enclosure in your letter of the 15th January, should be so worded as to make it clear that the ‘‘ rights of the French group referred to therein mean the right to one-third share of the capital and not to absolute equality with each of the other two participating countries. . For the confidential information of your group I am to state that it has been [2804 aa—' L 28FEB1S13 COPY o 28 FEB 19132 suggested to Sir E. Grey that a plan for overcoming the difficulty in question might he as follows :— Let the Trans-Persian Railway, from Astara to the sea, be one concession, but let the actual line be constructed and operated in two sections by two companies^ working in co-operation, Russian interests predominating on the northern section, British on the southern, while the relative interests of the three Powers in the enterprise as cf whole are maintained on a basis of absolute equality. An illustration will show that this may not be impossible. If, for example, the northern and southern sections are supposed, for the sake of simplicity, to be equal, the following distribution of capital would effect the object aimed at:— — Northern Section. Southern Section. Railway as a whole. Great Britain 1 5 6 France 3 3 6 Russia 5 1 6 France, it is true, would not be predominant on either section, but as she has no territorial interests this is not a fatal objection. Moreover, on the principle laid down in the statutes of the societe, she would only be entitled to one-third control, and this the above scheme gives her on both sections of the line. It is possible that a slight amendment of the statutes of the societe may be required to give effect to such a distribution as that suggested, but there should be no difficulty in this if the main principle of equality is preserved. I am to add that Sir E. Grey has no objection to your discussing this scheme with the French and Russian groups, but he would prefer that at this stage it should not be disclosed to them that the suggestion is one laid before you in a tentative form by His Majesty’s Government. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government] The British group welcome the clear statement therein contained of the opinions of His Majesty’s Government on certain points submitted for their consideration on the 9th December last. At the same time it is evident to them that if the views now expressed are maintained the lines of the original project for an international trans- Persian railway will have been so materially altered that none of the advantages anticipated from the through connection with India can now be reckoned upon in support of the scheme. Such departure from the original idea of direct rail communication between India and Europe will necessarily require full discussion with their French and Russian associates in the Societe d’Etudes. Before even this step is taken it would seem imperative to ascertain the extent to which British railway interests in Southern Persia are capable of consolidation, as it is only after settlement of this question that an international agreement can satisfactorily be reached. The extent and nature of participation which, with the consent of the British Government, should be offered to foreign interests oyer the main trunk line (running from the Russo-Persian frontier to Bunder Abbas via Shiraz) can then be determined. Dealing separately with the points of your letter under reply, I venture to advance the following considerations :— As to (a), the British group note the clearly expressed assent of His Majesty s Government to the principle of a trans-Persian railway project, but they desire to emphasise the fact that the conditions now imposed by the British Government are tantamount to converting the original Indo-European project into one mainly intended for the development of railway enterprise in Southern Persia. In these circumstances they would submit that, having stipulated for Government control, and insisted on an alignment suited to political requirements, His Majesty’s Government should not at the same time exclude the possibility of financial assistance in the future. In regard to (6), the British group are glad to learn that their co-operation in the Societe d’Etudes is still considered desirable on general grounds. They note that His Majesty’s Government hold themselves already engaged to support other interests in the following concessions : With regard to (2), the British group are naturally much concerned to find that His Majesty’s Government consider themselves committed in such a way as might render an important section of territory—one, moreover, vital to any tians-continental scheme—tributary to competing interests. # As to (3), these last-mentioned lines remain unspecified, and until the British group have learnt what they are, and been satisfied that they do not interfere with t e completion of the main alignment now suggested for adoption, they cannot usefully enter into discussion with other parties, British or foreign. With regard to the statement that “ His Majesty s Government would be prepared to recommend to the parties interested in the projects in the neutral sphere that it would serve British interests if they would join with the British group of the bociete d’Etudes,” the British group would be glad to know who are the parties interested m r LA] CD 7 PERSIA.

The absence of any further mention of the texts of the proposed inter-group agreement (enclosed in my letter of the 20th December, 1912), and of the proposed declaration desired by the French group ('enclosed in my letter of the 15th ultimo), leads the British group to assume that these documents also have the approval of the Foreign Office.

Grey’s information, that they have had under consideration Sir W. E. Garstin’s letter of the 15th January and the draft contained therein of a declaration proposed to be made by the British and Russian groups with a view to safeguarding the interests of the French group.

Our condition of approval of trahs-Pefsian Railway scheme was prompted solely by desire of collaborating with Russia, as we never anticipated that it would prove a tinancial success or that India would derive any benefit from it. Instead of a problematic scheme, we are now submitting a practical one for Anglo-Russian co-operation in the construction of a railway calculated to promote both Russian and British trade interests and to develop Persia’s resources. Minister for Foreign Affairs’ chief wish in any scheme seems at present to be to secure construction of a railway to Tehran. Persian Government , are never likely to consent to this except as part of a trunk line, and our proposal will enable him to attain his object as well as any other. On the other hand, he may j object to it on the ground that it will bring our seaborne goods up to the north of Persia. Our alignment, moreover, does not fulfil conditions on which Russian promoters of the original project based their calculations (see my despatch No. 112 of 1911) ; while enclosure in your despatch No. 64 suggests that railway should be described as traversing Persia from north to south. It is important that I should know whether I am to defend our alignment as being in our opinion the best for the projected railway that is to connect Russia and India, whenever we consent to it being carried through our sphere, or whether I am to put it forward as an alternative scheme on its own merits. The latter course would be tantamount to admitting that we wish to drop the former scheme as being at present unpractical for financial and other reasons, but I fear this iaterpretation will in any case be placed on our proposal. m ' ■ b ■ , j ' ' ' , ■ _ ... it^This Docifflent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Govemmpnt. ] railway syndicate to come to some arrangement with the Trans-Persian Pailway.

They said that the Russian group had now been constituted, and that they were only awaiting the answers of the British and Indian Governments, expressing approval of the scheme, to send delegates to London to enter into negotiations with the group, which, they trusted, would shortly be formed in England. They were most anxious that the reply of His Majesty’s Government might soon be forthcoming, as it was most important that they should receive it before people began to leave St. Petersburgh in another month. They both took a very optimistic view of the prospects of the railway, and expressed the hope that a source of indirect guarantee might be derived from the surplus revenues gained by the Russian and Indian railways from the increased freights brought them by the new railway. - They finally asked me to forward to you the accompanying confidential statement, which they have since sent me in the enclosed letter.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1. “Expose” respecting the Trans-Persian Railway. (Confidential.) IT can be assumed that the scheme of a trans-Persian railway, the overland route to India, has been favourably received in England. The doubts which have been expressed do not apply either to the idea itself, which to the belief of all will some day be realised, or to the political aspect of the scheme, which very opportunely fills a gap not only, in trans-continental, but even more so in British Imperial communications. The Russian group held from the beginning the belief that the scheme could be carried out in the near future. But it realised fully, without overrating their value, the obvious financial difficulties which have been pointed out from many sides. Since November last, when MM. Timiriazeff and Zweguintzow negotiated in London on behalf of the group, it has set itself the task of studying the various financial aspects of the scheme. [1969 aa —2]2 A staff of engineers and experts has actually finished its work under supervision of M. Petchkovsky, chairman of the Rostoff-Vladicaucase Railway and member of the group. It is our aim, leaving aside all the details and the ca culations, to expose only the net results of these fore-studies, which, we believe, are able to present the whole plan under an entirely new light. It is generally considered as an obvious fact that e- railway line in Persia can be built only under a direct Government guarantee. The;/ aforesaid preliminary studies enable us to state that this poin o new appears not quite correct when applied to a railway establishing a direct and uninterrupted overland communication between Europe and India, and to corroborate our statement by the following data :— 1. Preliminary Forecast.— The length of the railway across Persia will not surpass 1,400 miles, out of which 140 miles have been added in order to avoid the deserts of Dechet and Lut. The building expenditure is calculated at 18,700,(K)0L, the rolling- stock included. (The Russian group possesses surveys made m 1900 by Russian engineers for a large part of the line from the Russian frontier up to iverman.) Inis preliminary forecast has been made as broadly as possible within reasonable limits. English experts have expressed the belief that the expenditure would not surpass 15,000,000b The possible receipts of the railway can be obtained from the following sources (a.) Passengers and valuable goods going from Europe to India or vice versa. This paragraph contains also postal communications. Very valuable goods only (over 400Z. the ton) are taken into consideration, on a very moderate scale. Through goods from Europe to Persia are quite left aside . .... _ • • (£&gt;.) Goods going from Persia to Russia and British Beluchistan or vice versa (c) Local passengers and goods (d.) Revenue from the use in express train of cars belonging to the Trans-Persian Railway. (The construction of these cars is included in the afore-mentioned building expenses) Total 1,422,000 637.000 222.000 154,000 2,435,000 The expenses, the guarding of the railway included, are calculated at .. 1,725,000 The net revenue being, per annum .. .. .. .. .. 709,000 2. Indirect Guarantees. —A source of indirect guarantee can be extracted from the surplus revenus gained by the Russian and Indian railway nets after the opening of the direct trans-continental communications. These revenues are valued at 460,000b for the 2,225 miles of Russian railways, which will enter into the through line from Europe to India. The Russian Government, being opposed to a direct guarantee, which may impose a certain burden on the Exchequer, has admitted, on the contrary, the possibility of assuring the interests of the share and bondholders of the new railway out of that sum, which is an unforeseen, receipt, obtained thanks to the new through traffic. The same reasoning may be applied to the 1,400 miles (up to Bombay) or miles (up to Calcutta) in India and British Beluchistan, the whole sum exceeding the 709,000b, which the Persian line itself will be able to give to satisfy the said interests. There is no doubt possible that a sum of 1,200,000b per annum would be amply sufficient for that object, out of which only 500,000b have to be provided in the aforesaid manner or in any other way, which can be suggested by the future “ societe d’etudes.” There is no doubt possible as to the probable development of Persia owing to the railway, which may be combined with useful branch lines. One can also feel secure that, as every new highway of communication and of civilisation, the Indo-European trunk line will create an exchange, of people and of goods, which it is impossible to foretell. The main thing is that, having vast possibilities, the projected railway is based on tangible realities, whereas many railways in Africa, America, or elsewhere have been built with only a reasonable hope for a more or less distant future. Though these preliminary calculations have been made in a prudent manner and are based exclusively on official statistics and established facts, the Russian group believe that further investigations must be begun on a large scale by a special company or syndicate (“ societe d*etudes”), that syndicate will have to prepare the ground in all respects for the railway company, to obtain the concession from the Persian Government, and to negotiate all necessary arrangements with the States interested in the through traffic. Russian banks and railway companies have already subscribed a considerable sum for that object, and we may safely assume that at the present time we have obtained all that could be doneon the Russian side in order to support the scheme. The next step consists in the formation of the “ societe d’etudes” and depends wholly on the attitude of the British Government and of competent circles in England. Latest Events in Politics. —The latest events may influence to a certain extent that ^attitude and make necessary some observations about what we consider as the favourable political consequences of our scheme, which is a direct result of the Anglo- Bussian agreement and of the mutual confidence which has arisen as its sequel. Alter the division of Persia into spheres of influence, the interest of both England and Russia in that country have become identical as far as they are in touch. The integrity of Persia is now a political necessity to both countries and can be assured in the best way by a well-organised Government and by a great railway trunk, which is a guarantee of neutralisation. The absolute lack of improved means of communication makes the regeneration of Persia an impossible task, and the situation may be resumed in a very few words—no roads, especially no railroads, and no resources to keep up order. On the other hand, as a preliminary to the construction of railways, the question of Government guarantees crops up again. We will repeat here that this last question can be solved adequately only by the construction of a great central trunk line through Persia, with the embranchments necessary for the development of the country. On the other hand, the various plans which are now under discussion imply a great expenditure, whilst they lack the principal financial asset of the trans-Persian railway—the direct communication with India. Khanikme-Tehran .—The Khanikme—Tehran line, to which Russia has a right of preference, would lose a great part of its signification and would become financially a difficult problem when a through line running from Baku to Kurrachee would have come into existence. Indian goods will certainly use the direct way, and European goods would find it shorter and cheaper by Russia. In any case, the Khanikine line would have to be built in competition with railways already existing, and there could never be a serious danger of preference tariffs on that line. Other proposed Railways. —We may as well point out here a certain contradiction which has made itself felt when the question of Persian railways was discussed in various quarters. The same who express doubts about the financial realisation of the trans-Persian scheme advocate a series of railways which would cover the Persian territory with a very expensive spiders web. In*that respect we will mention, besides the Khanikine-Tehran Railway, the Trebizond—Van-Khoi line, the Shuster—Tehran line, the Nushki-Seistan line, and, on the Russian side, Enzeli-Tehran and several other lines of penetration. It is evident that these lines, put together, greatly surpass the total length of the projected route. It is strange that they should seem realisable, although their commercial and political value is very small indeed when compared with the overland way to India. General Advantages. —There is no need to discuss here at any length the various political problems which arise in relation to our scheme. The advantages of the proposed railway can be summarised shortly as follows:— 1. It is the shortest line. Wff do not mean that it is the shortest link between the Indian and the European railway systems, which would be over Afghanistan, and not over Persia. What we mean is the shortest through line, Calais-Calcutta or Calais-Bombay, taking into consideration Ihe railways already existing, the journey, London-Calcutta, will be possible in less than eight days. 2. It is an uninterrupted line, with no sea to cross from the Channel up to India. 3. It is the cheapest line for goods and passengers owing to the low Russian tariff, applied to 36 per cent, of the distance, Calais-Bombay. The first-class fare, London— Bombay, wifi be less than 401 It is also the cheapest to build, thanks to geographical conditions, whereas any line in Southern or Western Persia presents very seimus difficulties. * 4. It is the most favourable line politically, as 84 per cent, of the whole distance from India to Bomba.y is under British or Russian control; whereas the Bagdad line, for instance, depends even more than the Suez Canal on the attitude of Turkey One may add that with the construction of the trans-Persian railway the situation in the Mediterranean loses a part of its vital importance for Imperial communications. Any Russian port—even Archangel—may prove useful for the transport to India of British troops. .... .... 5. It does not unite the Moslem world of Turkey with their corehgionanes m India.6. It simplifies the solution of the Persian Gulf question as well as that of the Bagdad Railway, which will keep all its enormous signification for Turkey, but will not absorb Persian commerce and will not threaten communications with India. Conclusion—The members of the Russian group who will assume the task of pursuing negotiations in England will hold at the disposal of the British Government and of competent persons, the details and calculations which are the result of the afore mentioned work.

Alignment ought to be carried further east through Yezd. He said that he would have to submit this question to the Council of Ministers, and asked what we should do were the Bussian Government to decline to accept our proposal. I said that I could not answer this question, but pointed out advantages of carrying the railway through trading districts instead of through a desert, as well as beneficial effect which it might have towards restoring order in the south. His Excellency said that he would examine papers I had given him with his expert advisers and discuss the various points with me before sending his written reply. I gathered from his language that he is rather sceptical as to the railway being built beyond Tehran for years to come, and that his chief interest in the undertaking is to secure construction of line to Tehran.

The immediate object of the Convention was to lessen friction : but it was not intended to stop at this, and, having regard to the political conditions prevailing in Persia, and indeed to the existence under the Convention of a “ neutral sphere, the obvious corollary of abandoning mistrust and opposition, and an essential factor to the success of the new policy, was to be sought in the growing co-operation of both countries. When therefore the Russian Government gate the question of joining the Russian and Indian systems, it was felt that there were many considerations which rendered inexpedient a point- blank refusal: the artificial obstacles which, for many years, had been raised by Great Britain and Russia to railway development, and simply amounted to “ sterilizing ” Persia, could not be indefinitely justified or maintained in the face of altering conditions, such as the discovery of rich mineral deposits in many parts of Persia, the projected extension of the Bagdad Railway to her very frontiers, and the expanding interest of foreign Powers in the shipping of the Persian Gulf; moreover, His Majesty’s Government had no longer any power to oppose railways m the Russian sphere (which occupies more than half the distance from Russia to India); nor could they, under the terms of the Convention, veto possible extensions of Russian concessions into the neutral sphere, which is not an exclusive preserve of B /&lt;■&gt; V / * L lAi“EBl913 vj-'v Sir A. Nicolson No 6 P 3 e 2 tersburgh ^ tentatively laid before His Majesty’s Government December 1, 1909, the project of a Trans-Persian Railway, asking despatches. 11611 ^ especially that they should not decline to investi-British enterprise ; if, on investigation, the project of a trunk line should prove practicable and likely to be carried eventually into effect, British association with the undertaking would be mani festly advantageous, enabling us to condition the alignment and secure equal treatment for our trade, whereas an attitude of detachment might promote a Husso-German combination, effecting an acceleration of the project in a manner most detrimental to our interests, and not only to our interests in Persia. These points are merely stated here to explain the course of action which His Majesty’s Govern ment adopted ; they will presently be examined, with other considerations, in greater detail. In May 1911 His Majesty’s Government in formed the Russian Government that, after con sultation with the Government of India, they were prepared on certain conditions to assent in principle to the project of a Trans-Persian Rail way, and to agree to the initiation of negotiations between the British and Russian groups concerned, making it clear at the same time that they ex pressed no opinion as to the financial aspect of the question, which primarily was the business of the promoters. It may be mentioned parenthetically, and will subsequently be discussed more fully, that nego tiations had meanwhile (since the end of 1910) been proceeding between Russia and Germany respecting railway developments in Asiatic Turkey and Persia ; the possibility that these negotiations might take a turn not wholly com patible with British interests had served to emphasise the drawbacks which, as already indi cated, might be involved in a purely negative attitude towards the Trans-Persian project. In March 1912 the position of His Majesty’s Government was further defined in two letters to the British group of the promoters: these letters made various reservations, but the essential point to note is that the promoters at that stage were represented merely as a Societe (TEtudes— a syndicate formed to survey and investigate— and that freedom of action was reserved to His Majesty’s Government pending consideration of the report of the Society. All, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government had committed themselves to so far in regard to the project was this : they had agreed in pvmciple to a junction of the Indian and Russian railways ;3 I, 1 * [The Germans, under the “ Potsdam ” agreement of 1911, hold a reversionary right to build the Tehran-Khanikin line if Russia does not do so within a prescribed term after the completion of the Khanikin branch of the Bagdad system.] but this theoretical assent, which was expressly coupled with certain conditions made in the military and commercial interests of Great Britain and India, was subject to the junction of the two systems being financially practicable, for His Majesty’s Government carefully refrained from holding out any prospect of a guarantee. In the autumn of 1912 the Bussian Foreign Minister visited this country and, influenced by certain developments in the progress of the Bagdad Boilway system, his Excellency urged that the British and Bussian Governments should move a step further in the Trans- Persian project* : the Bussian Government had decided that it was imperative to link up their system with Tehran ; a concession to build this connecting line might therefore be sought by the Societe d’Etudes, who at the same time might apply for an option for the whole Trans- Persian Bailway. His Majesty’s Government agreed to support the Socidte in this course at Tehran, subject to all reservations already made, and on condition that the option, if obtained, should be “ limited,” that is, that construction should not proceed beyond the Bussian sphere until such time as His Majesty’s Government should consider it both politic and feasible. M. Sazonoff accepted this position ; and it was unequivocally agreed to by the British group in October 1912. An altered situation has, however, just arisen owing to a declaration of the British group that they are unwilling to send a representative to negotiate at Tehran unless His Majesty’s Govern ment will modify to some extent their attitude of reserve, and agree to support them in securing an option, not merely for a main line, but for branches and maritime facilities also. It is in these circumstances that the question has been referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence ; and, as it is no doubt felt that such a course will facilitate the work of the Committee in making recommendations on the points sub mitted, the occasion has been taken to reopen the whole question, including that of our agreement to the scheme in principle, ab initio. This fresh examination of the question is not unwelcomed by the Foreign Office ; but as there may be points overlooked or insufficiently empha sised, the following notes have been prepared:—No. 1. If, as seems not unlikely, the Trans-Persian railway in its entirety should prove financially uninviting, it cannot be overlooked that the scheme is not necessarily one indivisible whole, and d prendre on a laisser as such. Portions of the line, principally perhaps, within the Russian sphere but not improbably in the neutral sphere as well will be carried out eventually, whether or not there is British participation. If attention be confined for the moment to the Russian sphere : here is an extensive region where British commerce is considerable now and might in the future be increased, but where, under the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention, British subjects are debarred from railway enterprise, except by consent of the Russian Government. It may possibly be objected that the line from Yezd to Tehran is not a natural artery of British trade: but the Trans-Persian project, so far as the Russian sphere is concerned, is not confined to the main line, it comprises branches from Tehran to Khanikin, and from Ispahan to the main line. It is of great importance that the large British trade which enters Persia vi^ Bagdad should receive equality of treatment on any line which may be built from Khanikin to Tehran. The Board of Trade have represented, in regal'd to other railways, that it well-nigh impossible to insure against inequality of treatment unless there is an adequate representation of British interests on the board of management. The Russian Government in regard to this railway propose British participation, and the percentage of British representation on the Board is a point in regard to which His Majesty’s Government have made full reservations. The most effective way of precluding manipulalion of rates would perhaps be (a) an agreement with Russia to this effect combined with (h) the establishment of an international “Rates and Traffic Committee” whose function would be to arrange and enforce a table of rates, and there could be machinery for appealing to an impartial expert if decisions were not unanimous. No. 2. It is urged that British and Indian trade depends on railways running inland from the sea board, and “ that if we have these we may be able to compete in north-west and north Persia with Russian goods imported via Astara, or German goods imported via Khanikin.” Such competition in north and north-west Persia does not appear very promising if our railways from the Gulf stop short, as they must do, on reaching the Russian sphere, and if, by declining to participate by in the Trans-Persian project, we reject any share in the management of, or control over the freight charges upon, the lines in the Russian sphere : camels and caravans are not likely to prove efficient means of transport where the trade rival has a railway at his service. No. 3. Again, it has been urged - that a Trans-Persian Railway, “ with its long run through the wilderness from Karachi, will not enable us to compete in north and north-west Persia. The journey through the wilderness does not, it must be conceded, seem likely to contribute to this result: what may, however, contribute to successful competition is the possibility that Indian and Bntish goods can be sent by sea to Bunder Abbas, and thence be conveyed, without break of bulk, to the very heart of the Russian sphere. Should there be a branch from the Trans- I eisian line to Bushiie (though there may be objections to this on other grounds) there would be a choice of ports for the disembarkation of goods destined for through transport to north-west and north Persia. No. 4. Ihree further points of alleged financial disadvantage in have recently been submitted for examination :— the Trans-Persian Railway scheme (a.) The feared loss to British shipping by diverting the mail subsidy from a British Company to one winch will be international. r s (b.) If Bunder Abbas becoines a great port it will grow at the expense of Bombay and Karachi. (c.) 1 he sections of the railway between Karachi and Bunder Abbas would involve a dead loss to of India VenUeS,&gt; ^ ^ Baluchistan) must necessarily be built by the Government (a.) 1 he mail subsidy argument is familiar from the Bagdad Railway controversy; it is plausible, but it is doubtful if it will bear closer examination. So Jong as the sea route remains the quickest the mails will continue to be conveyed by sea. When the Bagdad route is completed and if, as is probable it is more expeditious, the public will mark Indian correspondencevH Vienna, and the Post Office, as m the case of the Siberian Railway, will adapt itself to the common-sense of the public. I he question at issue will not be, then, whether the mail subsidy should be paid to a British Company or an international railway: it will be, should it be paid to a brerman Railway Company or to an international one partly British ?(b.) llie prospects of Bunder Abbas developing as a port are not dependent solely on tbe construction of the irans-Persian Railway: such development may also come about if a line is built from Bunder Abbas to Kerman or Shiraz. . r £ h ? supposed loss to Indian revenues from the line to Karachi rests on the assumption that ms Majesty s Government are pledged to a junction of the Indian and Russian systems: they .have only assented to this m principle, and the consummation is dependent on being both politic and feasible. Having regard to the reservations made by His Majesty’s Government respecting financial liability, it is difficult to see how the Government of India can be called upon to build the section in British Baluchistan : indeed, having regard to the unremunerative character of any line between Bunder Abbas and Karachi, it is highly improbable, in the absence of a discovery of gieat mineral wealth, that the line will be prolonged beyond Bunder Abbas, unless, m Hie com se of time, there should be a sufficient surplus on the lines west of Bunder Abbas to enable the bociete to hand over annually such a sum as would cover any loss on the section built by the Government of India in British Baluchistan. No. 5. dhe next point is this assuming, merely for the sake of argument, that a Trans-Persian Railway project is likely in whole or in part to be realised, can we gain any strategical or political advantage by participation? It has been concluded by military authorities that if we can determine the alignment and break of gauge, and it we can lay down other conditions, then, even if we are not in a position to render wholly innocuous, we shall yet be able to blunt, what in some quarters is considered a potential weapon of offence. If, therefore,^ participation will secure this advantage, it is desirable strategically, unless it can be shown to involve greater disadvantages in other directions. The possible drawback is that our participation may hasten the advent of the line as far as Yezd; but in any case, whether v r e participate or not, the Trans-Persian line is ultimately going up to the limits of the Russian sphere, and when once the line is built so far it will be a natural development if Russian trade expands into the neutral sphere. Such expansion of trade might reasonably be followed by a prolongation of the Russian line into the neutral sphere, and as this would be in no sense opposed to the Convention of 1907 we could raise no objection. By participation now we might stipulate that no such extension of the Trans-Persian line into the neutral sphere should be in the direction of the alleged danger-point, Kerman. We should then, in the unlikely event of Russia becoming hostile, have ample warning before an extension to Kerman could be made. If, on the other hand, we abstain from participation, a Russian extension may be made to Kerman, primarily to meet the developments of trade, and we shall have no valid ground of objection. Turning now to the political side, what are the advantages to us of participation ? Generally speaking, it may be said that co-operation with Russia is, when practicable, primd facie desirable : it is a natural sequence of the Anglo-Russian Convention, and ithas much to commend it, not merely in Persia, where it affords a chance for a comprehensive settlement of the whole railway question, but also in the larger sphere of European politics. M. Sazonoff, in a memorandum dated the 27th September, 1912, has expressed the view that, if the request for an option were made to the Persian Government by the French end Russian groups alone, such a procedure “ produirait une impression tres facheuse, et serait, sans doute, utilisee comme in dice d’un dissentiment profond entre la Grande-Bretagne et la Russie.” What, on the other hand, may be the result of refusing co-operation ? It may be to bring about a Russo-German combination, first commercial and then political, in the Middle East. Such a consummation would be far reaching in its consequences, and could not fail to evoke serious migivings ; and it would, in the event of trouble between England and Germany, to say nothing of the efiects in Europe, expose India to the risk of a combined attack by Germany and Russia. Two possible objections suggest themselves: it may be urged that German and Russian interests in the Middle East are so divergent that a reconciliation is virtually impracticable, and it may be urged that the existence of a Trans-Persian Railway would be no safeguard against such a combination should it become a fact. The answer to the first objection is that the Potsdam agreement has shown Russian and German interests in the Middle East not to be irreconcilable. The substance of agreement was (a) Russia undertook not to oppose the Bagdad Railway ; (b) Russia undertook to link Tehran with the Bagdad Railway at Khanikin, and Germany secured the concession from Tehran to Khanikin in the event of construction by Russia not commencing within a prescribed term ; (c) Germany recognised Russia’s special interests in North Persia. It is easy to see how this agreement might develop if Great Britain were to meet Russian advances for railway co-operation by a nun possumus attitude. Russia might seek to divert German activity from the Khanikin-Tehran concession to the neutral sphere, where Russian interests are less important, and the change would be effected at British expense. As to the existence of a Trans-Persian Railway being no safeguard against a Russo-German combination, the argument advanced should rather be that if Great Britain and Russia, by a well-considered scheme of co-operation, have earmarked desirable concessions, forming connecting links in a possible Trans-Persian line, then there is less scope for a Russo-German combination.6 No. 6. Finally, is the Trans-Persian Railway inevitable ? It has recently been argued with some force that it is not: and if by a Trans-Persian Railway is understood the junction of the Indian and Russian railways then, except perhaps as regards the distant future, the conclusion seems correct. But it does not necessarily follow that many of the lines which might ultimately form connecting links in a trunk railway are not inevitable, and perhaps this distinction has not been sufficiently brought out. It is presumed that a railway is only inevitable if it is certain that it will pay, or if it is necessary to the parties concerned for commercial or political reasons. If these tests be adopted, a fair case can be made out to show that the greater part of the Trans-Persian project is inevitable. It probably is so from the Russian frontier at Astara to the shores of the Persian Gulf and to the limit of the British sphere at Sunder Abbas. The parties concerned are India, Persia, Russia, and Germany. The advantages to Indian and British trade of securing railway access to north-west and north Persia have been touched upon already. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has expressed the belief that both Indian and British trade would benefit by the projected railway, and find new openings. As regards Persia, Sir P. Cox, in the light of local experience, has stated “ it cannot but be supposed that the general effect of the railway would be to improve the administration, develop the country, and increase the capacity of the Persian market.” It has, on the other hand, been argued that Persia, while likely to benefit greatly by British railways from the Gulf, has nothing to gain by the extension of the Russian line east of Yezd: but surely this estimate makes insufficient allowance for the administrative advantage of connecting the Central Government at Tehran with the outlying provinces by direct communication. As regards Russia, it can hardly be denied that she would derive benefit from commercial access to the shores of the Persian Gulf. As regards Germany, it would seem that a large portion of her trade is likely to come by sea, and to pass up inland from the Gulf. It is urged, however, that if a Trans-Persian line is inevitable it will not be the Russian project, but a Gei-man extension from Khanikin to Yezd, which is likely to ruin the Russian scheme, on the ground that the Germans can and will effect a short circuit. This criticism appears to refer to a through traffic from Europe to India : it is not quite clear why it is held to be shorter via the German than via the Russian route, nor why the Germans can be so assured as to obtaining the extension to Yezd, but even if they do obtain it there is no palpable reason for concluding that a Russian line from Tehran to Yezd, and a possible extension of that Russian line to the Persian Gulf, should be ruined by a German line coming from a totally different direction, Khanikin. The upshot seems to be that, even if His Majesty’s Government adopt an attitude of detach ment, a great portion of a Trans-Persian project seems so likely to be carried out as almost to justify the epithet of “inevitable.” It remains to consider what the attitude of His Majesty’s Government should be : they have agreed to support the Societe at Tehran in seeking for a “ limited ” option for a railway across Persia : that is, an option which, outside the Russian sphere, is not to be exercised until His Majesty’s Government consider it politic and feasible. It seems advisable that the attitude of His Majesty s Government should be comprehensively defined, for purposes of record, in a communication to the Russian Ambassador; this communication should contain, as an enclosure, a copy of the proposed reply (vide infra) to Sir W. Garstin; it should in particular recall that one of the reservations made by his Majesty’s Government from the fiist was that there should be absolute equality of treatment over the whole system, and it should suggest that, before an application for an option is made at Tehran, the British and Russian Governments should formally signify to7 V— vest and ^lfia 8 railway &gt;t butte develop ad, beea netting e mates ament at * [It will obviously be more difficult to get the principle accepted if we wait till the option is secured; and. as we know from --previous correspondence that the Moscow faerchants are opposed to equality of treat ment, we had better get the principle formally accepted before the Russian Government are faced with a formidable agitation in favour of differential treatment.] each other the acceptance of the principle ol such equality, as unless it is so admitted (which to us the Kussian Government have not yet expressly done), there will be much adverse comment in this country. As the Russian Government have already admitted the principle to Germany in the ‘‘Potsdam” agreement about the Khanikin-Tehran project, they could not reasonably refuse to do so to us. The reply to the letters dated the 9th and 20th December from Sir W. Garstin might, it is submitted, be on the following lines :— In the first place, answers should be s^iven to the four specific questions, (a), (b), (c) and (d), asked in the former letter. (See Appendix No. 1.) mnereial come by m line is to lezil, 1 effect a | uite clear mans m ere is no extension ? a totally I detach- almost to [2763 n—14] (a.) That His Majesty’s Government have expressed themselves as prepared, on certain conditions, to assent in principle to the project of of a Trans-Persian Railway. That those con ditions are, inter alia, that the line shall not be prolonged beyond the Russian sphere until, and in such measures as, His Majesty’s Govern ment shall consider it both politic and feasible; that the main line from Yezd must enter the British sphere at or near Bunder Abbas and must not be aligned vi&amp; Kerman; that there must be a break of gauge at Bunder Abbas if the line passes east of that point; that His Majesty’ Government undertake no financial guarantee in regard to the project; that there shall be fair and adequate representation of British interests on the board of management, and a proper percentage of construction orders secured to British contractors; that absolute equality of treatment in all respects shall be guaranteed to British and British-Indian trade passing over the whole system; and that certain branches, to which further reference will be made, shall be secured to British concessionnaires in the neutral and British spheres. (A) That the answer is in the affirmative, though His Majesty’s Government trust that such progress may be made in regard to a well-considered scheme in the south as will render possible an early and it possible simultaneous start in con struction there. (c.) That His Majesty’s Government are com mitted : that the concessions in question are the Bunder Abbas-Kerman one in the British sphere D(which would have to be purely British-controlled), and certain lines (other than the one projected from Mohammerah to Khorremmabad) which, in view of the predominance of British trade, should be preponderatingly British though not devoid of a substantial international participation both in construction and management. (d.) That His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to recommend to the parties interested in the projects (other than the Mohammerah- Khorremmabad line) in the neutral sphere that it would be subservient to British interests if they would effect an amalgamation with the British group of*the Society d’Etudes, who, in consultation with His Majesty’s Government, might then arrange the degree and nature of the foreign participation in question. Referring then to Sir W. Garstin’s letter of the 20th December, it might be intimated :— 1. That His Majesty’s Government would agree to enclosure (A) (see appendix No. 2) on condition that the words “ d’Astara a Guattar ” are omitted (as there is no need to specify this to the Persian Government pending the survey), and on condition that the Societe definitely accepts the position that the question of maritime facilities to be granted in Southern Persia, and of the control of such port or ports, must be the subject of agreement between the British and Persian Governments. 2. That His Majesty’s Government would agree to enclosure (B) (see appendix No. 2), subject to the insertion of an additional clause to the effect that a permanent “ Rates and Traffic ” Committee shall be instituted to enforce, by whatever means may be most effective, absolute equality or treatment over the entire Trans-Persian system, that British interests shall be adequately repre sented on this Committee, and that, in the event of disagreement, there shall be a right of appeal to an impartial railway expert.

AS your Excellency is aware, during the visit of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs to this country in the autumn of 1912 various memoranda, on the subject of railways in Persia, were exchanged by his Excellency and myself. In one of these papers M. Sazonoff intimated, with regard to the Trans-Persian project, that the Societe d’Etudes wished to obtain from the Persian Government not merely, as previously, permission to make surveys, but an option for the project in question, and, he urged that His Majesty’s Government should lend their support to the Societe d’Etudes in this negotiation. Your Excellency will recollect that His Majesty’s Government had, up to that time, stipulated in their correspondence with the Societe d’Etudes that they should reserve complete freedom of action pending consideration of the report to be submitted to them after the survey had been made; but, in deference to the representations of M. Sazonoff, I undertook to support the Societe d’Etudes in the proposed negotiation at Tehran subject to all reservations previously made, and, inter alia, on condition that construction should not proceed outside the Russian sphere without the agreement of His Majesty’s Government. In November last, however, the Societe d’Etudes communicated to me the draft of a letter to the Persian Government applying not merely for a main line, but for extensive branch lines and maritime facilities. These proposals His Majesty’s Government could not fail to regard as more far- reaching and comprehensive than any they had yet contemplated : moreover they were not altogether compatible with certain of the conditions laid before the Russian Government by your Excellency in pursuance of the instructions contained in my despatch No. 129 of the 10th May, 1911. I refer to point 4, where it is requested that the Russian Government should support demands to be made by Great Britain to the Persian Government for certain branch lines. , / * 1 accordingly informed the Societe d’Etudes that the application which they proposed to make to the Persian Government was of a more extensive character than His Majesty’s Government wore in a position to support. In consequence of this decision, the British group of the Societe addressed to His Majesty’s Government two further letters (copies of which are already in your possession): in the first of these letters, dated the 9th December, the British group requested His Majesty’s Government to define their attitude more fully on various points, and intimated their reluctance to send a delegate to Tehran in the absence of fuller information as to that attitude; in the second letter, dated the 20th December, they submitted the draft of a fresh application to the Persian Government, in the hope that His Majesty’s Government might approve the modified text. This request of the Societe for more comprehensive support placed His Majesty’s Government in a somewhat difficult position, for, as the Russian Government are aware, another British Syndicate are interested in certain branch lines in Southern Persia; and, inasmuch as that Syndicate was in existence before the formation of the Societe d’Etudes, His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in supporting the latter in opposition to the former. Moreover, the request of the British group of the Societe for definite information on some points necessitated the consideration of many aspects of the question by His Majesty’s Government forthwith, instead of, as hitherto intended, on the submission of the projected survey. His Majesty’s Government have, however, welcomed an opportunity for cordial co-operation with Russia in the development of Persia by the construction of railways ; they are persuaded that such co-operation is a natural and very desirable result of the AnMo-Russian Convention of 1907, and that it affords the surest guarantee for the re-establishment of order in Persia. They have accordingly been happy to address [2804 e—11]the accompanying letter to the Societe d’Etudes, intimating that they are able to give them full support at Tehran in applying at once for a concession from the Russian frontier to the Persian Gulf. Your Excellency will observe that, as regards an extension within the British sphere towards the Indian frontier, His Majesty’s Government have intimated that, in their opinion, the time has not yet come to take up the ^ question of through connection with India, and they therefore advise the Societe d’Etudes, in their own interests, to devote their attention to branch and local lines on their commercial merits. In view of the cautious language which has always been used by the Russian Government and Russian statesmen alike regarding the construction of a through railway to India, His Majesty’s Government believe that the Russian Government will appreciate their point of view, and the sincerity of their conviction that the course indicated is that best calculated to preserve and increase the cordiality of the understanding now happily existing between the two nations; they accordingly invite the concurrence of the Russian Government in the course suggested in the accompanying letter. As your Excellency reported to me at the time, the Russian Government did not propose to give a definite reply to the points enumerated in my despatch No. 129 of the 10th May 1911 until the Societe d’iCtudes had submitted the report on the survey. As, however, the situation has now substantially changed owing to the nature of the application to be made to the Persian Government, I have to request your Excellency to recall the communication which you then made to the Russian Government, and to express the hope that they may now be willing to communicate their acceptance of the conditions which His Majesty’s Government proposed, except in so far as point 4 is modified by the terms of the letter to Sir W. Garstin, and by the arrangement agreed to with M. Sazonoff respecting the Mohammerah-Khorremabad line last autumn. You should communicate to M. Sazonoff a copy of the accompanying letter, and you should furnish his Excellency with full explanations in the sense of this despatch. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.' espatek m.

Sir, Foreign Office, February 4, 1913. HIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the letters which you addressed to this Department on the 9th and 20th December on the subject of the Trans-Persian Railway project. In your letter of the 9th December, while recognising that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government had hitherto been to reserve complete freedom of action pending submission of the survey you were to furnish, you intimate that you do not now feel justified in sending a delegate to Tehran to negotiate, in concert with French and Russian associates, with the Persian Government; and, before proceeding further, you ask that indications may be afforded to you on the following points :— (a.) It would seem essential to learn whether His Majesty’s Government view with favour or disfavour the prospect of direct railway communication between India and Europe via Russia. (b.) It would appear desirable to know whether His Majesty’s Government desire British financial interests to continue co-operation in the Soci^te d’Etudes in spite of such co-operation leading primarily to facilitating railway construction in Northern Persia only. (c.) In the event of His Majesty’s Government being already committed to support other applicants for railway concessions in the British and neutral spheres, it would seem essential to learn the scope of such concessions. (d.) In view of the possible advancement of conflicting projects for railway service in the British and neutral spheres, the British group would be glad to learn whether His Majesty’s Government have any suggestions as to a solution of the situation which may arise from rival claims in this portion of Persian territory. I am now directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to make the following observations on each of these points :— (a.) His Majesty’s Government have already expressed themselves prepared to assent in principle to the project of a Trans-Persian railway: that assent is made subject to the following, among other, conditions :— That no part of the line or its connections shall be constructed outside the Russian sphere until, and in such measures as, His Majesty’s Government shall consider it politic and feasible ; that the main line must pass through Ispahan by Shiraz, and if it, or any branch, is continued to the British sphere, it must reach that sphere at I Bunder Abbas ; that His Majesty’s Government do not think that the time has yet j come for a connection between Bunder Abbas and Karachi to be made, and as there I must be no question of making it until His Majesty’s Government consider that the | time has come when it is desirable, the question of branch and local lines should be | considered on their merits, and their commercial advantages should not be sacrificed | to the project of through connection ; that His Majesty’s Government undertake no | financial guarantee in regard to the project ; that the point where the line touches the Persian Gulf shall be referred to His Majesty’s Government when the surveys have been completed, and the arrangements for the maritime terminus, and for its control, shall be submitted to their approval ; that the question of the gauge outside the Russian sphere shall be submitted to His Majesty’s Government; that effective means must be provided, to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government, to secure British trade against differential treatment of any kind, direct pr indirect, on any railway constructed under a concession obtained by the Societe d’Etudes ; that British control must predominate in the Southern or Gulf section of any 1 rans-Persian line, or of the branches, which may be made, and that this control shall not be invalidated by any arrangement which may be made in regard to the percentage of other (i.e., non- British) participation in the undertaking. _ . . (6.) His Majesty’s Government raise no objection, regarding it as yery desirable on general grounds that the British group should co-operate in the Societe d Etudes, but they trust that such progress may be made in regard to a well-considered scheme [2804 d—1] Section 1. [A] PERSIA.2 of railway development in the south, as will render possible an early, and if possible simultaneous, start in construction from the Persian Gulf. (c.) That His Majesty’s Government are committed, and were so before the constitution of the Societe d’Etudes: that the concessions in question are the Bunder-Abbas-Kerman one in the British sphere (which would have to be purel}* British-controlled), and certain lines in the neutral sphere (other than the Mohammerah- Khorremmabad project) which, in view of the great predominance of British trade, should be preponderatingly British, though not without a substantial international participation both in construction and management. (d.) His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to recommend to the parties interested in the projects (other than the Mohammerah-Khorremmabad line) in the neutral sphere that it would serve British interests if they would join with the British group of the Societe d’Etudes, who, in consultation with His Majesty’s Government, might then arrange the degree and nature of the foreign participation in question. I am to express Sir E. Grey’s view that the arrangements for securing British control on certain portions of the line need not necessarily conflict with the principle of equal representation of British, Russian, and French interests in the undertaking from the northern frontier of Persia to the sea. In conclusion, I am to state that, subject to the acceptance of the conditions laid down, His Majesty’s Government are willing to support your Societe in the negotiations proposed at Tehran; but that they would recommend the substitution of the words “ dun chemin de fer traversant la Perse du nord au sud par Teheran ” for the words sui terntoire persan, &amp;c., &amp;c., .... par Teheran ” in the note which you propose to address to the Persian Government (see enclosure A in your letter of the 20th December). I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.’ “ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Gove rnment.] [B] PERSIA. ^ ^ —— CONFIDENTIAL. Section 5. [3149] No. 1. Sh' H. Llewellyn Smith to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 21.) [January 21.] Dear Sir Edward Grey, Board of Trade, January 20, 1913. AT the meeting of the Defence Sub-Committee on the Trans-Persian Railway you may remember that I raised the question of the possibility of securing predominant British control over the Persian Gulf section of any railway which might be carried out under a concession obtained by the Societe d’Etudes. I understood the reply to be that there was no difficulty in proposing such a condition, and that Russia had in fact already stipulated for Russian predominance over the section of the railway falling within her sphere. There was no opportunity of pursuing the matter further at the meeting, but I still feel in some doubt as to the actual position, for two reasons (1) that we appear to have formally consented to a statute of the Societe d’Etudes prescribing that any company constituted under a concession obtained by the societe for the purpose of making a railway shall be controlled by Russian, French and British interests in equal proportions. The provision is found in the protocol to the statute on p. 26 of the pamphlet sent to Foreign Office in Mr. Baring’s letter of the 27th March, 1912, and British adhesion thereto is expressed in the Foreign Office letter to Lord Erington of the 1st June, 1912. In these circumstances it would appear that the societe is precluded by its constitution from entertaining any proposal for predominant control by any of the three Powers over any particular railway. (2) The second reason is that even if means were found to satisfy the Russian demand for predominance within her sphere it by no means follows that we could secure predominance outside our sphere, and as practically the whole of the railway Ispahan- Bunder Abbas will lie outside our sphere any reciprocal arrangement with Russia for predominance within our sphere would be quite useless to us. If the difficulties to which I have called attention prove insuperable it seems to me that we ought to dis courage the British group from proceeding further, since it seems to me an impossible proposition that we should encourage a railway to be constructed from Bunder Abbas into the interior of Persia in which we should have only a third of the control, i.e., no certain control at all. In these circumstances I have been thinking whether there is any way of recon ciling the principle laid down (with our express approval) in the statutes of the societe with what we regard at the Board of Trade as the essential condition that British control should predominate in the Gulf section of any Trans-Persian line. The only plan that occurs to me is this. Let the Trans-Persian Railway, Resht to Bunder Abbas, be one concession, but let the actual line be constructed and operated in two sections by two companies working in co-operation, Russian interests predominating on the northern section, British in the southern, while the relative interests of the three Powers in the enterprise as a whole are maintained on a basis of absolute equality. An illustration will show that this may not be impossible. If, for example, for the sake of simplicity, we suppose the northern and southern sections to he equal, the following distribution of capital and control would effect the object aimed at :— Great Britain France .. Russia .. [2763 5] Northern section. Southern section. Railway as a whole. 1 5 6 3 3 6 i v r 5 1 6 N2 6 )France, it is true, would not be predominant on either section, but as she has no territorial interests, this is not a fatal objection. Moreover, on the principle laid down in the statutes of the societe, she would only be entitled to one-third control, and this the above scheme gives her on both sections of the line. It is possible that a slight amendment of the statutes of the societe would be required to give effect to such a distribution of control as I have suggested, but there should, I think, be no difficulty in this if the main principle of equality is preserved. If, however, objection is raised and prevails, this fact will prove that it is unsafe for us to go on, and that the British group should be discouraged from proceeding further. I have not gone in this letter into the obvious reasons why we think British predominance in the southern section of the line imperative. They are to a large extent the same as those which led us to the same conclusion with regard to the Persian Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. In particular there would be little difficulty in securing fair treatment for British trade over the line as a whole if one section of it is in British hands, while the difficulty of ensuring such equality if we are in a permanent minority in the management of the whole line is very great indeed. If you concur in the general view I have indicated I hope that the point will be clearly brought out in the reply which is now being drafted by the Foreign Office to Sir W. Garstin’s letters of the 9th and 20th December, 1912. In these circumstances the reply to the enclosure in Sir W. Garstin’s letter of the 15th January would appear to be that there is no proposal under consideration which would diminish the right of the French group to control one-third of the capital of any company formed under a concession obtained by the Societe d’Etudes. Yours very trulv, , H. LLEWELLYN SMITH.Ml/' 6 . K T ra.ns-?srs ian Railwiv Raifiarics on Inaia Office raeroorandum* dated $5. i . i 3 « —^ The opinion of the General Staff in India# formed upwards of a year ago &amp; not materially altered by subsequent examination, was based on the ^assumption that a through connection with India was sooner or later inevitable The ou.iects in view in the Gen. Staff recommendations were, (a) to keen the rrw\l ^ him., main line as far from the Afghanistan frontier as possible, (fe&gt; to select an alignment which would give our Naval power the greatest opportunities for rendering assistance, (c) to limit the construction of branch lines to those which would offer the fewest strategical disadvantages, and (d) to force an enemy to detrain his troops for concentration at a point as far removed from our frontier as possible. It was especially desired to Prevent at all costs, £a£ a through connection with India via Kerman, Robat and Nushki, and (b) a Ifc line by which Russia could gain overland access to the sea at any point East of the straits. The assumption on which this line of argument was based fol- -iows the official view of the Sec. of State for India given in letter dated ^ ^ ^ ’ | The India Office memorandum of S 1.13. discusses the situation from iifierent point of view, viz: that there is no necessity to assume that a through railway is inevitable. The Gen. Staff in India have not examined the jrombfcam under this asoectnor could they Prepare a satisfactory military aoore •elation of a situation which might assume a dozen or more different forms irising from so vague a basis as the mere negation of the existence of a ;hrough railway. But I have been asked for my Personal opinion on the pro position as thus presented, though for the reason given it must necessarily &gt;e more on the political &amp; commercial factors in the case than on the strateg ical effect of railways which these factors may or may not Produce. The Gen. Staff aimed at avoiding two dangers which they considered vejy reat, as stated above. For this reason they advocated a direct line to Bandar ejas and thence axong tne coast to Karachi. If tne avoidance of these dangers ouid be assured in any other way, we should willingly see the line from Banda: .bbas to Karachi abandoned altogether.Its only virtue lies in its maxing the xistence of another ana far more oangerous line impossible, for presumably here is no prospect of two through lines. I personally doubt whether the dan =3 gers referred to, i.e. a line through Kerman and Nushki, and a port on the ndian ocean in direct communication with Russia, can be obviated Permanently ithout some stronger and more definite Policy than that advocated in the n ' ia 011iCe mem# 'Cone can foretell what effect the present situ-2 -ation in Europe may have on our relations with Russiain even the near future, and where railways are in question we must look many years ahead, for once laid they are seldom if ever taken uo. A hostile Russia using every artifice to her own advantage, in trade, in railways,in political influence and in the furtherance of her ambition to get a Port on the Southern sea, will not be prevented except bv a strong Positive pol^^y wnich can be clearly understood. But that policy must be directed towards the furtherance of our interests as well as the limitation of Russian ambitions. In the mattr of railway development, our commercial and strategical interests can fortunately coincide. The Kerman and Sistan districts have great possibilities of future development which will be facilitated by the shortest and therefore the cheapest rail transport to the sea. Trade with the Shiraz district can best find its outlet at Bandar Abbas or Sushire. The flow of trade can be directed, if we wish, in these directions. The present trade or caravan routes owe their existence to rel- -ative security and the amount at cost of transport available, and. these conditions can be assurea by railway lines running inland from the coast, generally in a Northerly direction and avoiding the East &amp; West direction which is strategically objectionable. With these lines built and the flow of trade firmly estab1ishedon them, we should secure the bulk of the trade of S. Persia, which will increase enormously under stable government, and there would be no excuse for Russia to press for connections which she Dould only desire for hostile reasons. The proposed lines would include Khur Musa - JChurramabad, Bushire - Firuzabad - Shiraz, Bandar Abbas - Shirs./ Bandar Abbas - Rigan - Kirman, and Sistan - Guatar (or further East). [‘he effect would be to deflect Russia’s attention more to the Nest and to completion of a line joining with us at Khurramabad, to which there seems Little objection. If the recommendations made in the India Office mem., so far as they lo, can be given effect to and if successive Governments in future can be relied on to maintain a continuous policy and insist on their warnings &gt;eing listened to, with better . results than have lately attended such 'warnings” in Persia, all might be well. It would however be prefer- ■afcle to define the situation more precisely vis a vis Russia. This means i reconsideration of the 1 07 Convention as a preliminary to the ultimate3 partition of Persia* which can never become a Buffer State in any sense that would oenefit us. A demarcated frontier line* with a. belt of difficult arid country on our side ofit, across which no railways run, would express a policy which nobody could misunderstand* which would be easy to continue* and to adhere to, if relations became strained, with ?/J eve,ry chance of Popular support. A frontier does not necessar- -ilj mean the occupation of the country by a Permanent garrison of great strength, nor that a decisive campaign must be brought to its conclusion in this Particular area. We should in fact have no greater resoonsibi 1i- -ties than we are confronted with at Present, in view of the disturbed con- -aitdon of tne country and the difficult situation which has to be faced. Concurrently with this policy in.the interior, we should take such steps as are necessary towards establishing a naval centre in the straits off Banaar Abbas. It is unnecessary to give the full reasons for this as they are already, I believe, understood and accented. The importance of ths step is however very great to us, so much so, that the less said about it the better. If nations with conflicting interests in these cartsfind what our object is, we may expect bitter opposition when they realise its value to us. Concessions or landing rights are all that is required at Present, and there need be no talk of defences until our Naval power in the Bast is likely to be challenged. If we are obliged to listen to the rep resentations of the Russian Government on the subject of the railway (suggested in the India Office mem., as a first reason for being implicated in the proposal), we could agree to a line from Yezd to Bandar Abbas, provided no branch lines are made without our consent. We might let the Bandar Abbas - Karachi portion take its time and possibly postpone its construction indefinitely from lack of funds, for it would probably be the least paying part of the line. But the line 4-resi as far as the coast is what the Russians are an- -xious forand we must ensure that it reaches the sea at or West of the straits. In the former case it would have a warm reception in a British Naval atmosphere, and Russian influence would have less chance of pre- --ponderating than at any ether place. Even if temporarily postponed, I believe that a through railwaywil.. ultimately be madeand our oolicv should be such that* v/hen it is finally Proposed, there can only be one alignment for it, that is along or close to the coast. In the Eastern hemisphere some of the Powers rhlci^jnay have great influence are themselves still undeveloped and therefore f balance^f power in the East can only be arrived at after great changes tnd struggles. In my opinion the Trans-Persian railway would be a most im- .portant factor in these struggles and . judice our chances of ho Idin g pur own . I think it should be considered f ro? ;his larger point of 3 v£f$ s $s well as on account of its immediate effect on ;he defence of India 4*-69 attack from this direction.

Enclosure in Xo. 1. Viscount Errington to Sir Arthur Nicolson. Dear Sir Arthur, 8 , Bishopsgate, London, December 7, 1912. I YESTERDAY had the opportunity of explaining in further detail certain points alluded to in conversation with you on the 4th December about Persian affairs. As it may be convenient for purposes of record that I should embody in a letter the observations that you have been good enough to invite on your minute of the 4th December, I now write to say that as to points— 1. Advance. —I have nothing to add. 2. Loan. —I should prefer to amplify by saying that I confirmed your recollection that the Foreign Office had agreed to this business being placed in the hands of Messrs. Baring, who were willing to take charge of the British portion of this operation, subject, of course, to their being satisfied as ta security and conditions. On saying that you hoped Messrs. Baring would consider the Imperial Bank of Persia and Messrs. Seligmans being admitted to participation, I agreed to consideration being given to this point. 3. Trans-Persian Railway.- -You informed me that the Foreign Office considered the Trans-Persian Railway question as quite distinct from the questions of advances and loans. I agreed this was the case. Up to this point you will see that there is no material divergence in views between your minute and those I have here expressed, as I have merely amplified my own language for the sake of clearness. 4. British Delegate of the Societe d’Etudes.- —This is the point which I am afraid I must have failed to make clear on the 4th December. If Mr. Harrison proceeds to Tehran his negotiations with the Persian Government will be confined to the business of the Trans-Persian Railway. But I would now add that, as His Majesty’s Government are aware, the delegates have been selected with a view to their making enquiry into the financial situation and economic questions relating to Persia. It cannot therefore be said that they are going out to Teheran “ solely for railway purposes,” and I regret any misapprehension which may have been caused by my not explaining this point more clearly at the time. I need hardly add that no loan would be feasible until after the financial capabilities of Persia have been examined, and suggestions have been made for some machinery by which an effective collection and control of revenues is assured. Believe me, &amp;c. ERRINGTON. [2729 i- 6 ] COPY - ° dA 10 JAN 1S13 ISThis Document is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. Secret. Trans-Persian Railway. Minute by the Marquess of Crewe. It is quite true that the question for our prompt decision is, “ must we regard the Railway as inevitable?” using the phrase, of course, in its technical application to any political future that can be foreseen and for which we ought to be prepared. If the answer is in the negative, we must definitely face the enquiry, “ Do we, and do the Government of India, prefei on the whole to see the Railway made ? ” I agree that the Government of India argue on the basis of inevitability, not ot preference, for the making of the line; and that if we are prepared to face the odium from some quarters and the disappointment from other quarters which will follow a plain statement that we see no prospect of granting our share of the concession, the Government of India will be relieved. The action to avoid is that 'which commits us so deeply that we have the choice of gianting the concession while hating it, or of submitting to a plausible accusation of having lured the promoters to follow a will-o’-the-wisp. And we seem to me to be not far from such a position. I have always held that if there is to be a thorough connection, it ought to come about as most through connections have, by the building of service able local lines, and the linking of them as circumstances demand. That is the way in which one gets to Edinburgh, or Brindisi, 01 1 etersbuigh, 01 Constantinople, The Pacific and Siberian lines are on a different basis, and are really through lines ; but in those cases there was a distinct objective on a distant coast, and we do not admit that India offers an objective of that kind, or that she needs one. 5th January 1913.^ • I'Lg This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India m Council. Secret. Trans-Persian Railway. It is understood that the British group of the Societe d’Etudes are not prepared to go on unless His Majesty’s Government give more decided support than they have yet given. The moment is therefore critical, since it is thus in the poAver of His Majesty’s Government to wreck the scheme for the time being. We have to consider, then, Avhether the scheme is one Avith which it is desirable to go on, regard being had to all the interests iirvolved. The official vIcav of the Secretary of State for India was stated in our letter of 6th April 1911, in which British participation Avas justified on the ground that it might be argued that the geographical isolation of India Avas necessarily doomed, “ and that it behoA r es those who are responsible for her “ interests to be foremost in the race for concessions, so as to ensure that such “ at least as may be strategically and politically essential to her security shall “ be in her oavii hands. One or more of these concessions avouM be for railway “ lines, which, though their immediate purpose would be different, might, “ without disadA r antage, form connecting links in a Trans-Persian railway.” Lord Morley had already concurred in the Government of India’s opinion that there was no prospect of such a railway being a commercial success, and it is evident from the whole tone of the letter that the Trans-Persian railway as such was disliked here, but that means were being sought of enabling the Foreign Office to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Russian Government. It Avas thought that there Avas no harm in accepting in principle a scheme which Avas certain to prove impracticable. The question is should Ave now go beyond that attitude ? There can be no doubt that neither the Government of India, nor the India Office, nor the Foreign Office, nor any responsible business man would ever have spontaneously proposed a Trans-Persian railway for the sake of through connexion Avith Europe. There can be very little doubt that nobody likes the proposal, and that everybody would gladly see it dropped. But we are implicated in it for two reasons. (1) From a desire to please the Russian Government, and especially the Emperor, avIio is understood to press it strongly. (2) From an apprehension that if we do not agree to it now, Ayhen Ave can more or less make our own terms, it may some day be forced upon us by others on terms that may be very unfavourable. Now, there are obvious limits beyond Avhich the first of these reasons cannot be pressed. “ Why,” it was asked in India Office letter of 6th April 1911, “ why should “ India sacrifice all the strategical advantages of her geographical isolation “ in order to encourage a scheme Avhich, Avhatever prospect of profit it may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to herself?” The answer, if there is one, lies, from the Indian point of view, in the second reason, Avhich therefore deserves closer examination than it has yet received. The argument is this. Raihvay construction in Persia is inevitable. Persia cannot be “ sterilised ” as the India Office wished (letter of 23rd December 1909)—and either Russia or some other Power will sooner or later build railways in the direction of India, the alignment of, or rates charged on, Avhich may be very inconvenient. The only safe course, therefore, is to make the best terms Ave can noAV, while Russia is friendly. From their letters of 17th December 1909 and 19th January 1910 it would appear that this is the Foreign Office view. But since the latter date (which was prior to the formal Russian proposal), no reasoned statement of their views has been received. Reserving for further consideration later the question whether through railway connection is inevitable, the points to be examined are the supposed commercial and strategical (including political) disadvantages of standing aloof. S. 192. AThe disadvantages of standing aloof. * See for example memorandum by Indian Director-General of Commercial Intelligence, paragraph 3, memorandum by President of Indian Kailway Boai’d, paragraphs 3-8, report of Government of India’s Committee, paragraph 3. Now, as regards the former, our only weapon against hostile tariffs is a friendly international agreement. But the Board of irade are never tired of telling us that such agreements are of little real use because they do not touch—and nothing can touch—the indirect methods by which the rival country can bountify its own trade. What we stand to lose, then, by the absence of an agreement on the subject of rates is apparently nothing vital. But again none of the British or commercial authorities who have discussed the project have recommended it on commercial grounds. Quite the contrary : all have shown that neither as regards through, nor as regards local, traffic would it benefit India, whose trade with Persia—all are agreed — depends on railways running inland from the sea-board.If we have these, we may be able to compete in north-west and north Persia with Russian goods imported by rail via Astara, or with German goods imported by rail via Khanikin. If we have not, a Trans-Persian railway with its long run through the wilderness from Karachi will not enable us to do so. Again, therefore, what we stand to lose by the absence of such a railway is apparently nothing vital. The strategical and political dangers are perhaps more real. The danger points to India are presumably Kerman, Robat, and some port on the open sea between Bunder Abbas (which it is assumed that w r e can seal up with our ships) and Gwetter on the frontier of British Baluchistan ; and what we have to fear is that some other Power, i.e., either Russia or Germany, will build a line to one or other of those points, establish her political influence along it, and when the time comes deposit an army corps at the end of it. Take Russia first. So long as the entente exists Russia cannot, except by agreement with us, get beyond the limits of her own sphere, i.e., Yezcl; but the Trans- Persian Railway is going there in any case. If, however, the entente has ceased to exist, Russia is actually or potentially hostile. Bui in either case, the mere fact that the Trans-Persian Railway was in existence would not prevent her from building a line to Kerman, and continuing it to Robat if it were essential to her plan of campaign to do so ; and in either case, and whether the drans-Persian line were in existence or not, our only safeguard would apparently be a line of our own from Bunder Abbas to Kerman and such force as we might be able to maintain on it. While as regards a line to the sea at, say, Chahbar, its construction by a potentially hostile Russia would, if Lord Lansdowne s declaration is maintained, be a casus belli, nor would the existence of the Trans-Persian Railway as such prevent the case from arising. Of Germany ihe same appears to be true, except that it might be argued that the existence of a frans-Persian Railway might even increase the danger because of the standing temptation which, as pointed out below, it would afford of making a short circuit by an extension from Khanikin to Ispahan and 1 ezd. W hether there is any real military danger to India to be apprehended frorn Germany (or Turkey), I do not venture to discuss. If there is, then against Germany, as against Russia, the safeguard lies not in a Trans-Persian railway but in the possession of British railway concessions in the Biitish sphere Bunder Abbas - Kerman for construction, and Bunder Abbas-Gwettur, and possibly Chahbar-Kerman and Kerman-Robat, for blocking purposes. Is a Trans-Persian Hallway inevitable ? . . submitted, therefore, that if those concessions are obtained—and it is assumed that it is not beyond the power of British diplomacy to obtain them—-there is no additional danger, commercial or strategical, involved in standing out now fiom the Trans-Persian project, even if it can be built vGthout us and is inevitable. But is it inevitable ? It has been assumed iy very high authorities that it is, and a different opinion can only be expressed ^ with gieat diffidence. There seem, however, to be some considerations pointing in another direction. Presumably a railway is only inevitable if it is certain that it will pay, or if it is necessary to the parties concerned for commercial, strategical, or political reasons. Theparties concerned are India, Persia, Russia, and Germany. That the through line will either pay India, or is necessary commercially to her in self-defence or as an outlet for her goods, the overwhelming mass of authority denies, as has already been observed, and the British group have tSir W . E. Garstin’s letter of 9th Sta * ed * llat “'t' th ® Iwancfi lines can December 1912. make the project profitable.! Persia needs railways, but it is difficult to see what commercial or financial advantage she will derive from the establishment of through railway connexion with Europe across her territory, since ex hypolhesi that connexion will not pay India. What will benefit her enormously is the extension of the Russian system, or of the Bagdad Railway, to Tehran and Ispahan ; but she has nothing to gain by their extension east of Yezd. Similarly she will benefit greatly by British railways from the Gulf, but it does not appear that there will be any such additional gain by the formation of a through connexion as would make it financially profitable on its own account or in any sense commercially necessary to her. As regards Russia, if our authorities are correct, and as through connexion will not pay India, it is difficult to see how it can pay Russia, and it is noteworthy that even the Russian promoters ask for a guarantee. What will pay Russia, and is in fact necessary to her, is the extension of her system throughout her sphere, not a through railway for its own sake. The case of Germany is substantially the same, but it seems probable that a through German line is less unlikely to pay than the Russian scheme. An extension of the Bagdad Railway from Khanikin via Ispahan and Yezd is both considerably shorter, and, being German, likely to be more efficient. There is, no doubt, the disadvantage of break of bulk at the Bosphorus; but if our authorities are correct in assuming that there will be no appreciable through traffic in goods, that will not be a prohibitive obstacle, while for passengers it will present no difficulty, since on a journey of that duration there would probably be one change of train in any case. The Russian promoters have expressed a fear of the contingency of a German extension such as that indicated above, but it is not known whether our own experts have ever studied the problem from the German point of view; but on the assumption that such a through line will pay and will indeed be inevitable, the Russian Trans-Persian scheme will obviously not only not hinder it but will be ruined by it, since the Germans can and will effect a short circuit. And if this view is correct our policy now should be to negotiate with Germany, not with Russia, for a Trans-Persian railway—a proposal which is not at present before us. To whom, then, is a through line necessary for strategical or political reasons ? Certainly not to India, who, it is universally admitted, stands only to lose in those respects. As regards Persia, there is room for difference of opinion as to whether she will gam or Jose politically by the construction of such a line. Railways in general, no doubt, conduce to the maintenance of order ; but railways themselves cannot be constructed and worked unless order is maintained, and there is something of a circle here. Again, it is open to question whether the construction and working of railways by foreigners conduces to independence ; though, so far as such railways are international, scope is afforded to an oriental Government for its favourite device of playing off one Power against another, and so maintaining its own uneasy balance. But if the case be put at its highest it can hardly be maintained that a Trans-Persian railway in particular is so necessary to Persia politically and strategically that it is bound to be constructed. When we come to Russia and Germany we are almost bound to assume that if it is for political and military reasons necessary to either of them it can only be for offensive purposes against India; and the measure of their necessity is the measure of ours to prevent and not facilitate those purposes. It may be argued that a port on the warm water is essential to Russia, quite irrespective of India, as a base for operations in far Eastern waters, and that a railway to (say) Chahbar is therefore inevitable. But whether directed against India or not the incidental danger to India of a Russian base at Chahbar would be so great that Lord Lansdowne’s warning would have to become operative. Of course it is conceivable that in the future the conditions of railway4 pr i: transport may so altor tliat what is impossibl© now will hocomo inGvitabla then. But no practical policy can be based on that assumption, which may safely be left to be dealt with until it has verified itself. What has to be remembered is that by wdiatever line the approach is made there lie between British India and the Persian frontier not less than 360 miles of waterless desert; and it is submitted that the inevitableness, in existing conditions, of a railway across that gap has not been proved. Conclusions. It would doubtless be possible to attach too much weight to these considerations. If there were a strong case for the Trans-Persian Railway on its own merits, they might be allowed to weigh very lightly against it. But notoriously there is not. This memorandum does not profess to deal with that part of the subject, which has been exhaustively discussed by all the competent authorities, to whose conclusions there is nothing at present to be added' :!: \ A selection of them is, however, printed in an appendix, in order that stock may once more be taken of them collectively. In doing so two points must be borne in mind as regards the Indian authorities : — ( 1 .) The Government of India’s opinion is, on the surface, less qualified than the others. But it should be noted that they refer to their Committee’s report and say that they concur generally in its conclusions. But those conclusions are drawn from certain premisses, and, in the absence of any statement to the contrary, it must be assumed that the Government of India accept the premisses also. These are stated as follows :— “ 4. While, therefore, from the point of view of military policy there can be little question that the maintenance of the status quo would be preferable to the construction of the proposed railway, and while it seems at least doubtful wdiether the advantages to Indian trade would be at all commensurate with the advantages which would accrue to Russian trade with Persia, or with the financial outlay involved in the undertaking, we are nevertheless of opinion that having regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share in the control of any railway that may be made in Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining concessions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, the Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposals of the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may be considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade.” The Government of India s recommendation must therefore be taken as subject to the same qualification as the others. (2.) Lord Morley, in sending out the scheme to the Government of India, asked them to examine it, “bearing in mind the desire of His Majesty’s ^ Government to find themselves on common ground with the Russian Government, so far as the } 7 can do so consistently with their primary duty “ of insuring Indian interests against all probable risks.” (Secret Despatch No. o2, of 4th November 1910). It may therefore be assumed that all those who gave opinions intended to give the most favourable opinions thev conscientious 1 } could, lhat this was actually so is obvious even from the selection in the appendix; it becomes plainer if the opinions are read in iulJ. We have in them, then, the utmost that can be said for the scheme, and the burden of all of them is in effect, “ we do not like the scheme of a r£ through lailway, it has no merits of its own, and many dangers; but on ^ certain consideiations, not strictly relevant to the scheme of a Trans- Persian^railway as such, w r e must acquiesce in it with as good a grace as we can. Ihe object of this memorandum has been to attempt to show that those extraneous considerations are without substance.If that attempt has been successful, then, in order to justify British encouragement of the scheme, we are driven back on the first reason suggested on page 1, viz., the desire to please the Russian Government. If it is really the case that the withdrawal of our encouragement will endanger the entente, and if the European position, and the position of Great Britain in international politics, are therefore such as to make it necessary— even in the face of the dangers and disadvantages indicated by two successive Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff—to come into line with Russia (a matter of which the India Office has no cognizance), there is nothing more to be said.‘ :;: ' If the scheme is to be abandoned. But if that is nut so, and the question is still open, it is for consideration whether His Majesty’s Government should not take the first opportunity of receding from a policy which is so likely to develop to their disadvantage. There are four ways in which this can be done :— ( 1 .) The Russian Government can be frankly informed that after further full consideration His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that the time is not ripe for the scheme, which cannot, in any conditions that can be foreseen within a reasonable period, be expected to pay, and entails other incon veniences and responsibilities which we are unwilling to incur except in return for advantages of which this scheme offers no certainty. It might be suggested that, leaving this more ambitious proposal to the future, the tv\m Bowers should in the meantime confine themselves to, and at once take in hand, railway development in their own spheres, and, by joint agreement, in the neutral sphere. If the larger scheme is really “ inevitable ” it will come of itself when the lines more immediately profitable have been constructed. At the same time it would be necessary to deal with the question of a loan to Persia; for, as Lord Crewe has pointed out, by agreeing that the Societe d’Etudes should also be the agency for floating a loan, we have put into Russia’s hands the means of exerting great pressure on us ; since, if the Societe find the money, we can hardly object to their having the concession. This is a most important consideration, and must be borne in mind, even if the view taken m this memorandum is not accepted, and the scheme is proceeded with. If the Societe find the money now and produce a scheme which contains features objectionable to India, the pressure to sacrifice Indian interests will be very severe. . (2.) To make it impossible for the British group to go on. Phis can be done either:— (a) By telling them—or letting them understand in reply to the diiect question asked in Sir W. Garstin’s letter of 9 th December that His Majesty’s Government regard the scheme with disfavour ; or (b) By telling them, in reply to that letter and the letter of 20th December, that His Majesty’s Government can give them no further guidance and cannot promise support to any particular scheme befoiehand a rather dangerous course seeing that, if the British group went on in spite of this discouragement, a concession in terms inconvenient to us might be possibly carried through by Russian pressure at Tehran and forced upon us ; (c) By informing the British group at once of oui conditions and making them so stringent that it will not be worth while to pioceed. (d) By encouraging the Persian Railways Syndicate to adopt a non possumus attitude as regards branch lines. I he British group have stated that the main line will depend for its success on the traffic brought by certain branches, of which it is understood that they attach special importance to one from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government are under a binding obligation to support the Persian Railways Syndicate m respect of certain lines in Southern Persia, of which the Bunder Abbas-Kerman Iiiig is ons. Obviously tliGrcfor© it is essential that * * Except that, as between Indian and Imperial revenues, the situation indicated m India Office letter of 6th April 1911 will thus have arisen and if Indian frontiers are made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway extension, which Imperial policy and the attitude of His “ Majesty’s Grovemment towards European Powers force upon the acceptance of India, her “ claims upon the Imperial Exchequer will be strong.”1ft&gt; ; !li :p if' J V i ! 6 the Societe and the Syndicate should come to terms, and if the latter refuse to do so, the British group would not improbably withdraw. Now, inasmuch as the Syndicate have applied for a mining concession in the Kerman area, it is very unlikely that they will be willing to let the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line go unless His Majesty’s Government apply pressure. And it is submitted that as regards both this line and the others for which they have promised their support His Majesty’s Government would not only be justified in not applying such pressure, but ^vould not be justified in applying it. For these are the lines—lines from the Gulf inland—which by universal consent are the lines which will really further British interests, and there can be no reason for allowing them to pass out of British hands into the hands of an international Company who will work them in the interests of the main line. This applies especially to the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line, because it is in the British sphere, and, Kerman being one of the danger points, ought to remain under purely British control. If this course is adopted Mr. Greenway should be asked to apply for this concession at once—or as soon as the Mohammerah-Khorremabad concession is assured. By neither of these alternatives can His Majesty’s Government hope to escape the odium with the Russian Government of having wrecked the scheme; for Lord Revelstoke (who, it is understood, is already using every means of inducing the Russian Government to put pressure on us) will not fail to let it be generally known. (3 ; ) To continue to support the scheme, though without enthusiasm, in principle, trusting that when it comes eventually to be put before the public, it will prove to be hopelessly unattractive. Taken by itself this which is the course we have hitherto been pursuing—has little' to recommend it except that it postpones for a year or so the painful necessity of taking a decision. Combined with ( 2 ) (c) it would probably be effective ; alone it seems too risky; and moreover exposes us to constant friction ’ with the British group in the meantime. Of all these alternatives undoubtedly (1) is the best, because it is the most straightforward; but if ior diplomatic reasons it is impracticable then the line of least resistance is ( 2 ) (c) and (d) in combination. But if it is decided to adopt any of these courses it is most important that the Mohammerah-Khorremabad concession should be absolutely assured before our hand is shown ; for the Russians will undoubtedly try to block it if the} find that we are backing out of the Trans-Persian scheme. Great pressure should therefore be exercised at Tehran to secure it with the least possible delay. If the scheme is to he supported. If, however, His Majesty’s Government decide that the Trans-Persian railway scheme is one which they must ex animo support in the interests of this countiy and of India, it is essential, as pointed out above, first of all to bung the Societe and the Persian Railways Syndicate to terms regarding branch lines. It also seems desirable to give the fullest possible information or tie guidance of the British group. There are of course some questions In C l/ a T d f- d f d at the present sta S e ’ and ^ is necessary that we “ ™ ke f th ® S r AT teSt r f ei T atlons on the PO^ts covered by Foreign Office letter of 23rd November last to Sir W. E. Garstin, viz., alignment constitution of Board, representation of British interests percentage of construction orders freight and passenger rates, and gauge But while keeping a free hand on all these points, it is still possible to give the group as'a'workfng ^ ^ told *** *4 must assume (hi S it bust no^gntd sphere at Bunder Abbas - (C) 1 Ae tblTelf s^tLlflhelLf bas must be narr0Wer than that(d) That the question of maritime facilities to be granted on the Persian Gulf, and of the control of such port or ports, must be a subject of agreement between the British and Persian Governments. As regards (a) the Government of India have indicated a willingness to compromise on an alignment that would enter the British sphere a little to the north of Bunder Abbas, and, eliminating that port, would reach the sea at Chahbar. This is a point for the Defence Committee; but primd facie there seem strong objections to the creation of a port of that nature on the open sea outside the Gulf. (b) Represents the formal and twice repeated opinion of the Government of India. (c) Was recommended by the Government of India’s Committee on the o-round that a hostile Power would find it more difficult to widen a narrow O gauge than to lay a line within a broader gauge. (d) Will require careful consideration by the Defence Committee. It will obviously be a stumbling block to the Societe, and it may be that if other adequate measures are taken to secure the entrance to the Gulf, it wall be a matter of indifference to us who controls the ports inside it. And again, it may be considered that, if it is essential that we should control the ports, we can more easily secure the control through the Railway Company than through the Persian Government. But in the first instance, and to prevent the question escaping from our hands, it seems desirable to make this stipulation. A. H. 3rd January 1913. NOTE. Three points of disadvantage in the Trans-Persian Railway scheme which do not seem to have been sufficiently considered are submitted for examination. (1.) The loss to British Shipping. —The Russian promoters count the mail subsidy among their assets. The subsidy paid to the Peninsular and Oriental by His Majesty’s Government is 305,000L Again, if an extensive passenger traffic by railway really springs up, the loss will fall almost entirely on the Peninsular and Oriental, for the railway will always be dearer' than the sea route, and the Peninsular and Oriental are the dearest sea route. The Peninsular and Oriental have few friends—deservedly ; but they are still a British Company, and is not more justification required than has yet been shown for taking money out of the pocket of an all- British Company, and putting it into the pocket of a company of which only one-third will be British ? (2.) The loss to Indian Ports. —If the railway is built Bunder Abbas will become a great port at the expense of Bombay and Karachi. The Board of Trade seem to anticipate that any advantage that may accrue from the railway will be to Indian rather than British trade. No reason is given for that view. But in any case, will not British goods destined for Persia— instead of going, as at present, to Bombay or Karachi and being transshipped there—go direct to Bunder Abbas ? This would apply also to the trade via other Gulf ports and also Bagdad ; and it should be remembered that the trade of the British Empire with Persia is nearly double that of purely Indian trade with Persia, and is worth some three millions sterling. (3.) The dead loss to Indian Revenues on the section from Bunder Abbas to Karachi. —All authorities are agreed that owing to the nature of the country through which it runs this section cannot in any case be profitable, but attention has not been called to the full extent and nature of the probable loss. If a passenger traffic springs up, there will, it is true, be the passengers. But even supposing that the existence of the railway stimulates Indian trade, it will apparently only be goods from the north of India that will be sent by rail. For seeing that there must necessarily be break of bulk at Bunder8 Abbas (because of the change of gauge), will it not always pay Bombay and the south to send their goods by sea? Now the Bunder Abbas-Karachi section, which is about 835 miles long, falls into two parts. The part west of the frontier of British Baluchistan alone (420 miles) will belong to the Company ; the part between that frontier and Karachi (415 miles) the Indian Government must necessarily own themselves as part of the Indian railway system. The loss on the latter will therefore fall on Indian revenues. Is the Secretary of State for India in Council prepared to face it, in addition to the increased military and naval expenditure foreshadowed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff? and in any case, what becomes of the guarantee which the Government of India are asked to give out of the supposed profxt to Indian railways ? A. H. ® t S' f&lt; t) I D a e e9 ’JHi meson, tWoH U. APPENDIX. Extracts from opinions of various Authorities. I. Board of Trade, 13th September 1910. “ The Board desire ... to state . . . that in their opinion the scheme in question is of a very speculative character and has been put forward mainly in Russian interests .... “ In any event, while Russian trade would probably be considerably benefited by the construction of such a line as that proposed— and possibly Indian trade also in a less degree—United Kingdom trade would probably not be benefited by it to any material extent, at any rate for a long time after its opening. The possibility, indeed, might have to be faced that the expansion of Russian trade in the interior of Persia might take place at the expense of purely United Kingdom trade. “ The Board .... agree with Mr. Worthington’s view that so far as regards through traffic, the transport of passengers would probably form the bulk of the business of such a line, though even here the powerful com petition of the sea route would always remain to be contended against. As regards through goods traffic, whether to the 1 ar Bast, to Australasia, or to the Persian Gulf littoral, they do not think that the railway route would be utilised to any appreciable extent .... “ . . . If . . . two conditions be fulfilled, viz., a line from Kerman to the Gulf in the control of which British influence should pre dominate, and equal facilities for all throughout the whole railway, the Board think that His Majesty’s Government might adopt an attitude of benevolent neutrality towards the scheme. ..... “ The Board, however, doubt if, from a commercial point of view, the scheme is for the present likely to prove a success oi to attiact the investing public, unless the British, Indian, or Russian Governments, or the three jointly, are prepared to offer a guarantee of a certain minimum return on the capital embarked.” II. Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan (Sir A. H. McMahon, K.C.I.E.), 20th December 1910. “ . . . ft is unwise to expect that the present isolation of Persia can longer continue, or that we can indefinitely maintain freedom for India from intercommunication by rail from the west. “ The present proposal offers opportunities of a mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and if we decline to take advantage of it, we may be compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway connection under less favourable conditions. i , , “ The proposed railway must benefit Russian trade m much largei proportion than British trade, but it will benefit Indian trade and largely increase the bulk of both British and Indian trade by the opening up ol Persia ‘ It will increase the receipts of Indian railways and theieby benefit Indian revenues. . . . “ The military or political disadvantages of mter-railway communication are less than might at first sight be supposed, and are largely counteracted by the access afforded by the line to Seistan. &lt; “ These conclusions are arrived at on the assumption that our efforts are directed to preventing the line destroying the autonomy of I eraia S. 192. 010 III. Political Resident, Persian Gulf (Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E.), 20th December 1910. “As I understand the position, we must now assume complete good faith on the part of Russia under the Convention, and abandonment of former designs on India. We cannot, therefore, take our stand on the fundamental objections of Indian strategists against the connection of the Indian and Russian railway systems. If the above premise is conceded, it seems to me that an attitude of mere benevolent neutrality will hardly suffice, and might be dangerous ; and that having exercised the right, which the promoters concede to us, of constructing the line from Kerman southwards, we should support the present proposal to the extent of co-operating in the thorough examination of the project from the business and engineering points of view. . . . “ . . . With the above safeguards [he., concessions for certain branch lines, &amp;c.], and provided that commercial facilities for all be assured throughout the whole railway, I believe that both Indian and English trade would benefit and find new openings equally with Russian, and it cannot but be supposed that the general effect of the railway would be to improve the administration, develop the country, and increase the capacity of the Persian market.” IV. Director-General of Commercial Intelligence, India (Mr. E. Noel Paton), 31st December 1910. “ . . . I . . think that the Board of Trade view of the value of the railway for trade purposes is much nearer the truth than that of Sir Henry McMahon. In fact I agree generally with the Board of Trade. . . . I agree . . . that, having regard to the conditions under which it almost certainly would be constructed, the railway stands to do a great deal more for Russian than for Indian trade. Indian trade with Persia can best be served by rad ways from the seaboard. ... If participation in this inland railway is to diveri attention from the littoral lines (and it will be strange if it does not) such participation will be deplorable. I agree, therefore, that the immediate construction of a line to the Gulf should . . . be assured. . . . . . If it can be assured, then we may . . . look at the new inland project with a wider view . . . Most of the mam impediments to progress of all sorts [in Persia] are precisely of the kind that give way before improved communications. It is not merely a question of improved transpoi tation , . but all those other obstacles .... must almost certainly persist until a railway opens the country up .... No doubt the new railway will serve her [i.e., Russia] better than it will us, but it will seive us too, and on the whole it would, I think, create a greater likelihood of our getting even with Russia than can be said to exist at present. .... It is almost incredible that the more intimate commerce, mercantile and social, that would attend the creation of a railway, could fail to bring about some sort of assimilation of that part of Persia which is nearest our borders. 1 should imagine that from a political point of view this would be worth something even if the railway did not pay for a good many years. I should not expect it to pay in the literal sense until the process of assimilation had gone pretty far. . .11 good ^ i* brand ^ assurel ] glisb trade cannot kt improve | e Ae Pereiai V. Chief of the General Staff, India (Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig, K.C.I.E., &amp;c.), 3rd January 1911. “ . _ . The previous military policy of India has been based upon maintaining its strategic isolation, so that attack becomes, if not impossible, at all events so difficult and lengthy an operation as to involve great financial strain on the attacking power, and to ensure that before decisive issue is joined, the whole military strength of the British Empire will be available .... “ . . . . The advocates of the scheme .... evidently .... anticipate difficulties on our part, and, assuming that a line will ultimately be constructed, the problem becomes one of rendering it as strategically innocuous to India as possible, by finding some artificial obstacle which will in some measure take the place of the natural barrier which it is proposed to pierce, so that the strain thrown upon the military resources of the Empire in the event of foreign aggression may be neither too sudden nor too severe for them to bear. In the opinion of the General Staff such a substitute can only be found in making use of our preponderating sea power, as a means of control of the proposed line, and in adequate fortification, at some distance from the frontier of India, of a naval base through which the proposed line must run .

Wynne, K.C.S.I., &amp;c.), 6 th January 1911. “ . . . . As a through line connecting India and Europe, the proposal has no claim to any merit from the Indian commercial point of view. The possibility of goods traffic being carried by the line between England and India is quite out of the question. “ The difference in length between the rail and sea route to India, taking Karachi as a centre, will be very small, and the sea route will always be by far the cheaper in cost of transport of goods, besides being more convenient and also shorter to places in the south of India .... “ In regard to passenger traffic between England and India, the practical effect of the building of the railway will probably be that steamer fares will be reduced and they will still retain the traffic. Further, passenger traffic between Europe generally and India must be small .... “ . . . . As a railway proposition .... it is not a scheme which one could recommend the Government of India to have anything to do with from the financial point of view ; but the line is one of quite an unusual character, and it has to be considered from other points than those affecting railway finance .... “ That North Persia will be opened out by a railway which will either be international or Russian seems certain, and what India has now to do is to take advantage of the present position to consolidate itself in Southern Persia. The course indicated seems clear, and it is to welcome cordially the proposed through line as an international railway and to agree at once to make as part of the Indian Railway system a line from Nushki to some point in Seistan which is suitable for a junction with the international railway. “ The ready acceptance by India of the international scheme would be a useful card in the direction of counteracting the negotiations now in progress between Russia and Germany, which may lead to Northern Persia being opened out by a Russian railway with the same objects as were in mind when the Manchurian line was constructed to Port Arthur . . . .” S. 192.

Inter-Departmental Committee, appointed by Government of India,' 1 *' reported 8 th February 1911. “ . . . . From the purely strategical point of view ... it would undoubtedly be preferable that India should maintain her quasi - insular position and should refuse to co-operate in any scheme which would tend to facilitate the transportation of a hostile Power up to or across her frontier. We recognise, however, that the march of events in the Near and Middle East renders it impossible that this position of_ isolation can be indefinitely maintained .... From this standpoint it seems to us desirable to seize the opportunity which the present proposal offers for securing the conditions which we consider essential rather than to wait until circumstances may force us to permit the connection on terms which may be less advantageous. With regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, we are in general agreement with the opinions expressed in the letter from the Board of Trade . . . We do not consider that there is any likelihood of goods being carried on the railway from the United Kingdom to India or vice versa . . .We are inclined to doubt also whether the through passenger traffic on the railway would be of any great magnitude The proposed line can, therefore, hardly be expected to prove a financial success .... “ . . . . We are nevertheless of opinion that having regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share in the control of any railway that may be made in Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining concessions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, the Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposals of the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may be considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade. . . .” VIII. Government of India, 23rd February 1911. “ • . . . We concur generally in these conclusions [i.e., those of the Inter-departmental Committee], except in regard to a few points as to which we find ourselves unable to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. • • With these reservations we commend the Committee’s proposals to the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government.” 0 IX.

Ihe Muhammadan population is small and turbulent, the country is badly governed, life and property are insecure, and though some districts are fertile, most of Southern Persia is believed to consist of mountains and deserts. ... It will always be easier and cheaper to carry on our passenger traffic and our commerce with India by sea than by land. ... j j“It is proposed by the military authorities in India that a long stretch of the railway should run along the sea-board from Bunder Abbas to Karachi. To protect this part of the railway we should have to increase our navai force in the Gulf, and to distribute a military force along the line. . . . In any case we should have to pay heavily for these precautions, and it has to be considered how the ships and troops are to be provided. . . . It is submitted that from a naval and military point of view, our responsi bilities for the defence of the Empire are so extensive at present that it would be folly to add to them with the object of benefiting and tranquillising Southern Persia. From a financial point of view, no country is rich enough to incur large unproductive expenditure except for its own safety or in furtherance of its own interests. In proportion as we spend British capital on the railway under reference and supply naval and military force for its protection, we shall weaken ourselves in other and more important directions.” X.

Grey is not yet in possession of the modified proposals which, he is given to understand. are about to be communicated by the Societe d 'Etudes but he considers that the whole question should be fully examined in its commercial, political, and strategical aspects at the earliest possible date by the Committee cf Imperial Defence, and he would be glad to learn whether the Marquess of Crewe agrees —with COPY TO INPHA | 10 JAN 1913 1 SECRETARY'S N2 2 The Under Secretary of State, India Office.with thiP view. A copy of a memorandum, dated December 19th, hy the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, hap already been trailpnitted. to your Department, and I am to refer especi ally to the last paragraph of section 3. Sir E. Grey considers that, if the Marquess of Crewe concurs, this subject - our military and naval position at the entrance to the Persian Gulf - might at the same time be proposed for examination by the Committee of Imperial Defence. With reference to this subject I am to suggest that, should the present efforts of the Persian Government to punish the tribes concerned in the murder of Captain Eckford and to re-establish order in South Persia prove fruitless, the best way of securing redress equivalent to the loss of British prestige in Ears might be not by the despatch of a punitive expedition but by the occupation of Bunder Abbas until order is re-established, should climatic conditions admit of such a measure.

In addition to this, the British Government express their inability to support the demand for any option on branch lines outside the Bussian sphere, and they moreover stipulate that the option (if obtained) shall not be exercised in that portion of Persian territory where British control and political interests predominate (that is, in the neutral and British spheres) until His Majesty’s Government deem this course politic and feasible. In regard to terminal facilities on the coast of the Persian Gulf or of the Indian Ocean, Sir Edward Grey now expresses grave concern at the contemplation of this aspect of the Trans-Persian project. Finally, the Foreign Office suggests postponement in the conclusion between the British and Russian groups of an agreement, which was purposely submitted at the present stage with the object of obtaining for British and Indian interests such safeguards in the future on tariff and other matters as His Majesty’s Government may indicate as politic and desirable. It will be useful here to examine the motives which prompted responsible financial houses in this country to consent to the examination of this Trans-Persian Railway scheme, as well as the steps which have led up to the present phase of negotiations. In July 1911 a visit was paid to this country by certain Russian promoters of the scheme, whose favourable reception was solicited by M. Kokovtzof, the present Russian Prime Minister. Conversations which were held in London with a view to an Anglo-Russia a combination for promoting this project failed to elicit the co-operation of Britis financial interests. The Russian promoters being dissatisfied with the response met with in political and financial quarters in England, applied to French financial circles for the furtherance of their schemes. In consequence of the representations of the Russian Ambassador in Paris, M. Isvolsky, who urged that serious attention should be given to the project, the French financiers undertook to examine the affair, and in November 1911 solicited the co-operation of British financial interests in an International Company to be composed of British, Bussian, and French elements. Before financial support was given in London the Foreign Office was consulted, and the attitude adopted in official quarters led to the belief that British financial co-operation would not only be politic, but would also be commercially justifiable. After prolonged negotiations and consultation with His Majesty’s Government, the Societe internationale d Etudes du Chemin de Fer transpersan was formed and finally constituted in June 1912. Since that date periodical meetings have been held in Paris for carrying into effect the objects which the “societe had in view. The Foreign Office have been duly notified of the various stages of proceedings, and it is with the object of receiving guidance and support fiom the Secretary oi State for Foreign Affairs that these communications have been made. Hie British group appreciate the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in confining themselves to their readiness to consider the report of the Societe d’Etudeswhen com pleted, and also to support a demand for a trunk line concession qualified by reservations previously mentioned. At the same time it will be recognised that, inasmuch as the terms of a concession to be obtained claim consideration before any report can be drawn up and submitted by the societe, it is essential that the full scope of the concession to be asked for should now be clearly defined. . b e seen, therefore, that circumstances of the present situation oblige the British group to suggest that the foreign Office should now depart somewhat from the attitude they have hitherto assumed, and that they should give definite indications of t e views of His Majesty s Government collectively on some points of importance which demand settlement at the present stage. The British group would therefore urge that in departing from their attitude of awaiting the “ socidte’s’’ report before making any definite announcements, His Majesty’s pvernment would facilitate an amicable adjustment of terms for a working agreement 'V+v, ^ USS1 ^ an d f rench interests by stating definitely at this juncture the exact nature ot the conditions they would vvish to see imposed in order to safeguard British and British Indian interests as far as possible in the future.3 It was in the hope of elucidating the views of Sir Edward Grey that communications were addressed to the Foreign Office on the 4th and 18th ultimo. Sir Louis Mallet’s confidential letter of the 23rd November recapitulates reservations already mentioned, but fails to afford the British group any particular indications as to the attitude they are to assume in the arrangements which must now be discussed with their French and Russian associates. The texts of the two documents forming enclosures “ A” and “ C” to Sir William Garstin’s letter of the 4th November were put forward in order to invite suggestions in regard to tariff and other questions, and it was hoped, if the texts of these two documents proved unacceptable to Sir Edward Grey, that he would see his way to indicating such modifications and additions to the texts as would meet with his approval, so that the British group might lay these amended documents before the Socidte d’Etudes for consultation as to the procedure to be followed. As to the text of enclosure “ A ” above mentioned, we would point out that in the course of the informal exchange of views which have from time to time taken place, the British group have been led to understand that there would be objection to the main line passing through Kerman—this objection possibly not applying with the same force to a branch. Consequently the Societe d’Etudes may be obliged to contemplate an alignment nearer the sea, conceivably even following the littoral for a short distance. In these circumstances it would seem unreasonable to debar the Trans-Persian Bailway from access to the sea. We understand that His Majesty’s Government are concerned at the general terms in which application has been made for maritime facilities in the draft note to the Persian Government. The British group would therefore suggest the insertion in the text of a clause providing that the points where such maritime facilities are granted in the south must be subject to agreement between the Persian and British Governments. It is hoped that this modification in the draft note will enable His Majesty’s Government to lend the “societe” their diplomatic support on the point in question, which will then be suggested to the Russian and French groups. In the question of branch lines the British group have no desire to claim any “virtual monopoly of railway enterprise ” in Southern Persia, such as Sir Edward Grey appears to apprehend. All they desire is to safeguard their own interests, and to such an end they put forward suggestions by which they considered those interests would best be served. They would be glad to learn the nature of such alternative measures as Sir Edward Grey may have in mind that may accord with the policy of His Majesty s Government, and at the same time secure to the Trans-Persian Railway reasonable facilities for obtaining traffic by means of branch lines, without which a main line cannot be expected to prove commercially remunerative. As the text of enclosure “ 0” in its present form appears to the Foreign Office inexplicit, the British group would be prepared to propose to their Russian and French associates the insertion of a clause to the effect that nothing in the proposed agreement (enclosure “ C ”) should be hereafter interpreted as admitting the imposition of differential rates in the respective spheres, or justifying the application of any measures of discrimination in regard to traffic facilities. _ In the present circumstances, however, the British group do not considei themselves justified in asking Mr. Harrison to proceed to Persia with MM. Bizot and Raffalovich to negotiate on behalf of the Societe d’Etudes with the Persian Government.^ It is hoped, however, that Sir Louis Mallet’s letter^ of the 23rd ultimo may form the basis for further discussion before definite communication is ^ made^ by the British group to their French and Russian associates in the Societe d Etudes, whose representatives are expected in London on the 12th December, to confer on t re business of the “ societe.” I have, &amp;c.

Garstin to Foreign Office.—(Received December 10.) (Confidential.) gi r 8, Bishopsgate, London, December 9, 1912. I BEG to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter of the 23rd November on the subject of the Trans-Persian ftailway project. From the exchange of views which has taken place since the commencement of discussion on the Trans-Persian Railway project, the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government is understood to be that, while reserving their complete freedom of action, they would, on submission of a detailed report by the Societe d’Etudes, be prepared to consider on their merits the proposals of _ the “ societe,” and after consultation with the Government of India they would indicate their views in detail as to the principle and manner in which they would wish the Societe d’Etudes to proceed in the execution of the project in question. JP In the meantime, the position, as set forth in your letter, would appear to be as follows:— His Majesty’s Government are agreeable in principle to supporting the Societe internationale d’Etudes in negotiations with the Persian_ Government for obtaining a concession, giving an option for a trunk line across Persia contrived for the establish-' ment of through transit facilities between the Russian and British Indian railway systems. Z .The support of Sir Edward Grey is qualified by obligations on the part of the British group to obtain at the proper time the approval of His Majesty’s Government in regard to— (a.) Alignment; (b ) Board’s constitution; (c.) Representation of British interests ; (d.) Percentage of construction orders for British market ; (e.) Freight and passenger rates ; and (/.) Gauge. In addition to this the British Government express their inability to support the demand for any option on branch lines outside the Russian sphere, and they, moreovei, stipulate that the option (if obtained) shall not be exercised in that portion o eisian territory where British control and political interests predominate (that is, in the neutral and British spheres) until His Majesty’s Government deem this course politic clUcl • /.In regard to terminal facilities on the coast of the Persian Gulf or of the Indian Ocean, Sir Edward Grey now expresses grave concern at the contemplation ot this aspect of the Trans-Persian project. . . . , ,i Finally, the Foreign Office suggest postponement m the conclusion between the British and Russian groups of an agreement which was purposely submitted at the present stage with the object of obtaining for British and Indian interests such safeguards in the future on tariff and other matters as His Majesty s Government may indicate as politic and desirable. iTJt will be useful here to examine the motives which prompted responsible financial houses in this countrv to consent to the examination of this Trans-Persian Railway scheme, as well as the 'steps which have led up to the present phase of negotiations O.In Julv 1911 a visit was paid to this country by certain Russian promoters of the scheme, whose favourable reception was solicited by M. Kokovtzof, the present Russian Conversations which were held in London with a view to an Anglo-Russian combination for promoting this project failed to elicit the co-operation of Bntish financial interests. [2729 k —1]2 /'* The Russian promoters, being dissatisfied with the response met with in political and financial quarters in England, applied to French financial circles for the furtherance of their scheme. In consequence of the representations of the Ifussian Ambassador in Paris, M. Isvolsky, who urged that serious attention should be given to the project, the French financiers undertook to examine the affair, and in November 1911 solicited the co-operation of British financial interests in an international company to be composed of^ British, Russian, and French elements. /2 ( Before financial support was given in London the Foreign Office was consulted, and the attitude adopted in official quarters led to the belief that British financial co-operation would not only be politic, but would also be commercially justifiable, it being felt that the situations arising from the abstention of British co-operation from the initial stages of such international enterprises as the Suez Canal and Bagdad Railway might again present themselves in the case of a Trans-Persian Railway being constructed without the introduction of a British element. After prolonged negotiations and consultation with His Majesty’s Government, the Societe inter- nationale d’Etudes du Chemin de Fer transpersan was formed and finally constituted in June 1912. Since that date periodical meetings have been held in Paris for carrying into effect the objects which the “ socidte ” had in view. The Foreign Office have been duly notified of the various stages of proceedings, and it is with the object of receiving guidance and support from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that these communications have been made. The British group appreciate the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in confining themselves to their readiness to consider the report of the Societe d’Etudes, when completed, and also to support a demand for a trunk line concession qualified by reser vations previously mentioned. At the same time it will be recognised that, inasmuch as the terms of a concession to be obtained claim consideration before any report can be drawn up and submitted by the “ society,” it is essential that the full scope of the concession to be asked for should now be clearly defined. /f.It will be seen, therefore, that circumstances of the present situation oblige the British group to suggest that the Foreign Office should now depart somewhat from the attitude they have hitherto assumed, and that they should give definite indications of the views of His Majesty’s Government collectively on some points of importance which demand settlement at the present stage. /tOt will be recognised by Sir Edward Grey that once a concession is obtained in general terms from the Persian Govenment, the Russian and French interests in the Societe d’Etudes are less likely to prove amenable to British wishes in matters of detail than they would be at present before the concession is obtained. The British group would therefore urge that, in departing from their attitude of awaiting the “ societe’s ” report before making any definite announcements, His Majesty’s Government would facilitate an amicable adjustment of terms for a working agreement with Russian and French interests by stating definitely at this juncture the exact nature of the conditions they would wish to see imposed in order to safeguard British and British Indian interests as far as possible in the future. Y,The British group have naturally no wish to act in any sense contrary to the dictates of the British Government policy, but in the absence of direct indications of the considered views and policy of His Majesty’s Government as a whole in regard to many details essential to the prosecution of their ideas, the Societe d’Etudes fee Ibound to be guided in their decisions as to future procedure by the nature of the indications afforded on the following points :— (a.) Before proceeding further it would seem essential to learn whether His Majesty’s Government view with favour or disfavour the prospect of direct railway communication between India and Europe via Russia. (b.) It would appear desirable to know whether His Majesty’s Government desire British financial interests to continue co-operation in the Societe d’Etudes in spite of such co-operation leading primarily to facilitating railway construction in Northern Persian only. (c.) In the event of His Majesty’s Government being already committed to support other applicants for railway concessions in the British and neutral spheres, it would seem essential to learn the scope of such concessions. (d.) In view af the possible advancement of conflicting projects for railway service in the British and neutral spheres, the British group would be glad to learn whether His Majesty’s Government have any suggestions as to a solution of the situation which may arise from rival claims in this portion of Persian territory.A Until the British group are in possession of definite information on these points, they trust that Sir Edward Grey will recognise their inability to form any satisfactory conclusions as to the circumstances in which they are placed. &lt;n It was in the hope of elucidating the views of Sir Edward Grey that communications were addressed to the Foreign Office on the 4th and 18th ultimo.

He is of opinion that any compromise or any alignment other than that passing through Bandar Abbas would be fraught with danger, as would any branch line leading to Kerman from the North West or linking that place to a Port outside the Straits of Hormuz. He further begs to suggest the early considera tion of the necessary steps to secure permanently our naval and military position at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. 4.

Confidential. No. 1. Foreign Office to Sir W. Garstin. Foreign Office, November 23, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of Viscount Errington’s letter of the 18th instant, in which he furnishes certain explanations respecting the enclosures in the letter addressed by you on the 5th instant to this department on the subject of the Trans-Persian Railway project. Before dealing, as promised in my preliminary letter of the 14th November, with the proposals now under consideration, I am to recall the important reservations which His Majesty’s Government have consistently maintained in regard to this question. In a letter dated the 2nd March, 1912, and addressed to Lord Errington, the following passages occur :—- “We have no objection to any percentage of distribution or representation, of which Lord Revelstoke may approve, in so far as the interests of Great Britain, Russia, France, and ourselves are concerned in the Societe d Htudes. . , . u But wc must bo understood to reserve full freedom of action when it comes to the actual construction and subsequent management and control of the lines which may be built. We shall expect if the scheme is to be carried out with our approval, to be consulted about the alignment, constitution of the board, representation of British interests, percentage of construction orders to be placed on the British market, and, in general outline, about freight and passenger rates. “Our obiect is not to raise difficulties, but to reserve our freedom of action m regard to such matters, and I need not say that, when the Societe d’Etudes furnishes its ^ report, we shall take into full consideration any recommendations which you may lay before us. ’ [47191] (Confidential.) And in a further letter, addressed to Lord Revelstoke on the 25th March, 1912 the following passage occurs :— “I am to add that, amongst the questions as to which His Majesty’s Government desire to retain their freedom of action with regard to this railway, should be included that of the gauge to be adopted.” In September of this year, during his visit to this country, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated a memorandum to Lord Revelstoke, proposing the early dispatch to Tehran of delegates representing the Socidtd d Etudes ; and on the 23rd October Lord Revelstoke explained, during an interview with bir L Lrey, the Marquess of Crewe, and Sir Arthur Nicolson, the points at issue. O' ™ 6 28th October a record of these explanations was furnished to the Foreign Offace by Lord Revelstoke, and it contains the following passages : “The immediate question before the society was the obtaining of a conoe^ion from the Persian Government granting permission, m general terms, to survey, and caiiyin B with it a option to construct a line traversing Persian territory; the actual points to be included in the aCment beTng left to future examination and decision after approval by the Governments concerned This concession was to be asked for as a whole, but for the present it was proposed to limit actual construction to the northern section between Ast»a and mran and to for the eompanv optional rights covering the completion of the scheme. Ihese rights, so iai as they pertained to territory within the Russian or British spheres of influence, would be retained ^^gent ^roposa/^a^^approach^reTers^airGoveniment with a view to obtaining their slnctihi to thh hove by th/Sispatch at an T h SocWte d’fitudes as a whole and the British Russian and French group were prepared to nominate and dispatch a representative, and it was piesu that the Russians contemplated similar action.” “ Si r Edward Grey,” in the words of Lord Revelstoke, ‘‘ expressed willingness to give his sanction in principle to delegates being sent to Persia for the purpose of obtaining the concession as outlined above. , , o- t: pi „ Thus the substance to be asked for, to which the assent of Sir E. Grey was carefully limited, was “ a concession from the Persian Governpn^granting permission, [2700 2—1] . - | 29 NOV 1912 /# ' (; sjstwmiy t SECRETARY'S N 9 469 fc v in general terms, to survey, and carrying with it an option to construct a line traversing Persian territory; the actual points to be included in the alignment being left to future examination and decision after approval by the Governments concerned.” Moreover, it was recognised that His Majesty’s Government reserved complete freedom of action in regard to construction outside the Russian sphere (that is, in the neutral ancMT' British spheres), and that such construction should not be undertaken until, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, it should be deemed politic and feasible. It would obviously have been impossible for Sir E. Grey, consistently with the reservations enumerated in the letters addressed to your society in March last, to have acquiesced in more far-reaching proposals at this stage; it had indeed been expressly intimated in this correspondence that His Majesty’s Government could not commit themselves in regard to the execution of the project until the report of the Society d’Etudes—a body primarily formed for the purpose of study and investigation—had been submitted, and the object in view was that the conclusions arrived at in the report should be fully considered in their commercial, political, and strategical aspects by His Majesty’s Government. Sir E. Grey considers that it would be hardly possible for His Majesty’s Government to reserve that freedom of action which has always been stipulated for, pending con sideration of the report of your society, if they were now to afford you diplomatic support at Tehran in pressing the specific proposals embodied in your letter of the 5th November. I am now to refer seriatim to the enclosures in your letter. Enclosure (A), the draft of a letter which it is proposed to present to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, sets forth under three headings the objects of the Society d Etudes in sending delegates to Tehran; these are to secure :— 1. Permission to make the necessary investigations and preparations for the construction, on Persian territory, of a railway joining up the Russian and Indian frontiers, and for all extensions calculated to further the essential object of the line—that is to say, for the building of railways destined for passenger and goods traffic between the Russo-Persian frontier and the Indo-Persian frontier. ^ favour of the Soci^te d’Etudes, for a concession for the above-mentioned lines, ouch an option should also be assured to the societe for building branch lines which would e natural feeders of the main line, or which might, under foreign control, injuriously affect its traffic. J 3. Finally, certain maritime facilities at the terminal points being necessary for working the lines, the societe would desire to secure its position in this respect also. His Majesty s Government are willing, subject to the reservations contained in ^ e ^ ers tbp 2nd and 25th March last, to support your delegates a ^i 1 . iran secur i u g an option as originally proposed for a main line; they are wdlmg to do so on the distinct understanding that the option is not to be exercised outside the Russian sphere, that is, in a region where British commercial and political interests predominate, until they deem it politic and feasible. As to the question of branches, His Majesty’s Government cannot support your &amp; ^ eS stage in negotiating even for an option outside the Russian sphere. When your report is completed they wall consider carefully, and on their merits, such recommendations as may be put forward; but Sir E. Grey cannot conceal from you his view t at a concession, such as is outlined in your letter, would confer upon your society a virtual monopoly of railway enterprise, and, having regard to the magnitude of British interests in Southern Persia, His Majesty’s Government cannot commit them selves, even provisionally, to the proposals now before them. While ^&gt;ir E. Grey cannot but regard the question as somewhat premature, he recognises that, if railways are built in regions adjacent to those traversed by the line you have m view, then means should be found for securing through traffic, destined to pass^ on to, or coming from, your system, against unfair manipulation on railways outside your direct control. His Majesty s Government are also unwilling to agree to the third proposal in Enclosure (A), regarding terminal facilities on the Persian Gulf; Sir E. Grey was not, mdeed, aware that the Trans-Persian Railway—by which it was proposed to connect Russian and Indian territory—was projected to reach the Persian Gulf, or, indeed, that ^ any terminus on those waters was contemplated. The matter is one of great po itical importance; and His Majesty’s Government cannot support your delegates in a negotiation which, should it now be pursued, would cause them grave concern. Enclosure (B) contains an enumeration of branch lines—a subject to which it is unnecessary that I should refer in greater detail.3 k ♦ Enclosure (C) is the draft of an agreement of which the declared object is to emphasise the preponderating rights of the British and Russian groups respectively in the British and Russian spheres. While the wording of this draft does not appear to Sir E. Grey to be primd facie open to serious objection, it is not very clear, owing to ^the brevity of the document, what its scope or interpretation will be. His Majesty’s Government cannot therefore, in the absence of more precise information, express their concurrence in its terms, since to do so might conceivably imply acquiescence in differential treatment of British merchandise on branches in the Russian sphere. Thus an important artery of British trade will be the route via Bagdad and Khanikin into Persia; and it is essential that British imports should not be throttled by unfavourable treatment on the railway after passing the Turco-Persian frontier. This aspect of the question was emphasised in the Foreign Office letter, already quoted, of the 2nd March, 1912. I am to suggest, therefore, that there would be substantial advantage in postponing the conclusion of the agreement which forms Enclosure (C) until a later date. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. jt '—..

In the temporary absence of Sir William Garstin, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter addressed to him on the 14th instant relative to the Trans-Persian Railway project. , . . , , , ' Note has been duly taken of Sir Edward Grey s views m regard to the proposals outlined in Sir W. Garstin’s letter of the 4th November. In the course of my conversation with you and Mr. Parker at the Foreign Office on the 15th November I had occasion to explain, in regard to Sir William Garstin s letter above mentioned, that the text of enclosure (A) to that document was drawn up in Paris at the last meeting of the Societe d’fitudes, and represented the considered views of that body as to the form of request to be presented to the Persian Government which would best promote the interests for which this societe was established^ In the absence of specific details as to the extensions from the trunk line upon which the company may desire to obtain options in order to safeguard their interests, it was held desirable by some members of the British group to enumerate such exten sions as the Russian and British delegates of the societe might consider it desirable to discuss on arrival at Tehran. A note (enclosure (B)) specifying these extensions was consequently appended for the information of the Foreign Office. # In view liow6\ r 6r&gt; of tlis opinion now ©xprossod. cis to tlio mcibility of flis MnjGsty s Governments lend their support to the Societe d’Etudes in acquiring a concession for some of the branches indicated, we would submit that the note constituting enclosure (B) should for the present be suspended in so far as extensions from the trunk line in the neutral and British zones of Persia are concerned. . While the Societe d’Etudes will be glad to be favoured in due couise with the detailed views of His Majesty’s Government on the proposals already submitted, I venture to hope at the present stage of proceedings that, m view of the suspension of enclosure (B), the attention of the Foreign Office m the matter of the Irans- Persian Railway may more particularly be concentrated upon enclosures (A) and (O) of Sir William Garstin’s letter. . . . , In the opinion of the Societe d’Etudes, it is undesirable that the arrangement arrived at between the British and Russian groups should become known to the Persian Government, and, consequently, the societe propose that the final text ot enclosure (C) should be considered as strictly confidential. It has already been intimated to the loreign Office that the delegates o the societe contemplate starting for Persia about the middle of_ December, and m view o: the expediency of enabling the British member, Mr. Harrison, to co-operate with his Russian and French associates, I venture to nope that the Foreign Office may see tieir way to giving at an early date a clear indication of the support Mr. Harrison may expect to receive from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran m negotiating with the Persian Government on behalf of the Societe d’Etudes. , • , , » It was with this object in view that enclosures (A) and (0) were submitted for consideration on the 4th November, to allow of discussing with the I rench and, Russian groups such modifications in the text of these documents as the Foreign Office might require prior to affording support to the societe^ m^on to Persia.

My dear Sir Arthur, 8, Bishopsgate, London, October 28, 1.912 I HAVE the pleasure to enclose you herewith a memorandum which embodies, to the best of my recollection, the gist of our conversations of last week. To this memorandum 1 have appended a short note of my own. Believe me, &amp;c. BEVELSTOKE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum of Conversations held at the Foreign Office, October 23, 1912. Present: Sir Edward Grey, Lord Crewe, Sir Arthur Nicolson, Lord Bevelstoke, and Lord Errington. Trans-Persian Railway* ON Sir E. Grey’s enquiry as to the points at issue, Lord Bevelstoke explained that Lord Errington was proceeding to Paris to attend meetings of the Societe d Etudes at the end of this week, when questions arising from M. Sazonof’s aide-memoire^ of the 27th September, 1912, would come up for discussion. A copy of this aide-memoire had been handed to the Foreign Office on the 11th October, and is annexed to the present memorandum (Enclosure 3). _ ... • r The immediate question before the societe was the obtaining of a concession from the Persian Government granting permission, in general terms, to survey, and carrying with it an option to construct a line traversing Persian territory ; the actual points to be included in the alignment being left to future examination and decision after approval by the Governments concerned. This concession was to be asked for as a whole, but for the present it was proposed to limit actual construction to the northern section between Astara and Tehran, and to obtain for the company optional rights covering the completion of the scheme. These rights, so far as they pertained to territory within the Buss!an or British spheres of influence, would be retained by the groups representing the countries respectively interested. _ . The present proposal was to approach the Persian Government with a view to obtaining their sanction to the above by the dispatch at an early date of delegates representing the Societe d’Etudes as a whole and the British, Bussian, and French groups individually. The French group were prepared to nominate and dispatch a representative, and it was presumed that the Bussians contemplated similar action. Lord Crewe remarked that in point of fact a concession for the construction was being demanded on behalf of Bussia as far as the southern limits of her sphere of interest in Persia, while the option demanded by the British group would not be exercised until such time as work within the limits of the British zone should be considered to be politic and feasible. It was agreed that this was so. ^ , • • i Sir Edward Grey expressed willingness to give his sanction m principle to delegates being sent to Persia for the purpose of obtaining the concession as outlined above. Persian Loan. Lord Bevelstoke said that, in the aide-memoire referred to above, M. Sazonof suggested that the delegates whom it was proposed to dispatch to Persia tor the purpose of obtaining the railroad concession, might also be instructed to enquire into [2700 n—1] 18 N 0 V 1912 ; A . LL - o \/ TO -“H INDIA f 22 NOV 1912 lECP.ETARY’S N24?2 the financial problem; and in various subsequent conversations he had urged the predominating importance of the loan question. M. Sazonof had pointed out that it was impossible to put an end to the existing chaos without the creation and maintenance of an effective gendarmerie, and that the formation of such a gendarmerie was itself impossible without the resources necessary to meet the entailed expense. Thus the real problem to be confronted, in Lord Revelstoke's opinion, was how to raise a sufficient sum of money to enable the Persian Government to carry on an effective administration and eventually to repay the sums already advanced by the British and Russian Governments. Whatever steps were taken in this direction, Lord Revelstoke maintained that an interval must of necessity elapse between the establishment of machinery (either in the form of a caisse, or a commission set up under direct Anglo-Russian Government auspices for the effective control of the Persian revenues), and the time when these revenues would be flowing into the Persian Treasury with sufficient freedom to allow of the hypothecation of sums adequate to form security for a foreign loan. It was obvious that the mere receipt of any report on the finances would not put a term to this period of chaos. Money was required for the re-establishment of law and order, and the country could not hope to float any loan based on the unaided security of its own resources until after it had been demonstrated that sufficient revenues to meet interest and sinking fund charges could be and had in fact been collected. The only practical solution seemed to him to lie in obtaining the co-operation of the two Great Powers towards the providing of such an amount of cash as would permit the re-establishment of law and order, and as would suffice to bridge over the considerable interval which must elapse before a considered report on the financial condition could be received and discussed, and arrangements made to organise an effective caisse or commission under Anglo-Russian management, with a view to the eventual issue of a loan of sufficient importance to repay the advances already made, and to provide for the further necessities of the country. Lord Revelstoke then referred to the telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris, copy of which had been forwarded from the Foreign Office on the 18th instant (Enclosure 4). In this message it is indicated that the French group intend to send two French representatives to Persia, one of whom, M. Bizot, would be a financial specialist. Lord Revelstoke pointed out that the sending of a Freijch financier might possibly result in the b rench group stipulating for a French representative on any caisse or board of control to be formed, and enquired whether such a stipulation might not lead to the Germans demanding a like representation. Any decision as to the dispatch of such financial specialist might at any rate be postponed, he thought, pending the consideration of the suggestions which he was venturing to put before Sir Edward Grey. He quite understood that the two Powers might be unwilling to guarantee the interest and principal of an issue repayable through, say, thirty years ; but would the British and the Russian Governments entertain the idea of assisting Persia by guaranteeing an advance, repayable, say, in three years’ time ? After dis cussion, Sir Edward Grey and Lord Crewe expressed their willingness to lay this sug gestion before the Cabinet. A sum of 1,000,0001. was mentioned—half to be guaran teed by the British and Indian Governments; the other half by the Russian Government. This figure of 1,000,000L was mentioned as one which might be favourably considered, but there were no data to show whether it would be sufficient to meet the needs of the situation. bir Edward Grey requested Lord Kevelstoke to let him have some memorandum embodying his ideas, and intimated that, after its receipt, he would place himself in communication with the Russian Government authorities. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Note by Lord Levelstoke. THE accompanying memorandum suggests that an advance should be made to the Persian Government, repayable in, say, three years’ time, and guaranteed as to principal and interest by the two Powers. In the event of such an advance beinof approved in principle, it will be for the Governments concerned to decide whether they elect to authorise the issue of three-year“ M. Sazonof spoke strongly when in Paris to M. Poincar^ in support of the dispatch to Persia of a French representative on behalf of the Soci^te d’Etudes. “ What M. Poincar^ thinks will be arranged by the French group, and to which he would see no objection, is that there should be two French representatives : one a railway specialist, who would probably be M. Yitalis, and the other a financial specialist, who would be M. Bizot, who has already been employed in Persia, is appreciated there, and would like to return to that country.” Foreign Office, October 18, 1912. j Under Se Secretary Committe Under Se^ Secretary^ •• | in any further communica tion on this subject, please quote V l) No. j and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, ■Vi)) London.

At a meeting held in Paris on 26th October, the Societe International d*Etudes du Chemin de fer Transpersan was duly notified by the British group that approval had been signified by the Foreign Of fice to the principle of a mission being despatched to Persia at an early date to negotiate with the Persian Government for the concession desired by the Society d*Etudes. It is now proposed that this mission shall be composed as follows:- Monsieur Bizot representing French group Mr. F.C. Harrison representing British group Monsieur Paffalovich representing Russian group. It was arranged that Monsieur Bizot will pre side over the mission, which contemplates starting for Persia on or about 15th December, lv?12, passing via T'h a TinHQnr» y**31'.piT*V &lt;vf Statevia St. Petersourg. The duration of the mission is estimated at from two to three months, for which period we understand Monsieur Bizot proposes to apply for leave of absence, it being consequently his intention to resume his post iV' in the French Government service. On arrival at Teheran the Delegates will present to the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs a letter setting forth the objects of their mission. A draft of this proposed letter (Enclosure 'A') is enclosed herewith for the approval of the Foreign Of fice, and we venture to hope that Sir Edward Grey will see his way to instructing His Majesty's Minister at Teheran to support Mr. Harrison in his negotiations with the Persian Government. It is understood that the Pussian and French Ministers in Persia will receive authority from their respective Governments to support Monsieur Baffalovich and Monsieur Bizot in their negotiations on behalf of the Sociste.

To Tub Right Hon’ble the E1RL op CREWE, K.G., His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India* Fort William, the 23rd February 1911. Mr Lord, We have the honour to refer to Lord Morley’s Secret despatch No. 32, dated the 4th November 19LO, and subsequent telegraphic correspond ence on the subject of the scheme proposed by the Russian Consortium for the connection of the European and Indian railway systems by the construction of a line from Baku to Nushki via Tehran, Kum, Kashan, Yezd and Kerman. 2. As will be seen from the enclosed papers, the question of the attitude which India should assume towards the scheme has been fully discussed both departmentally and in consultation with our local advisers. In view of the diversity of opinion displayed in the preliminary discussion, wo thought it advisable to appoint a representative inter-departmental Committee to examine and consider the question in all its bearings and to advise as to the terms of the reply to be sent to your predecessor’s despatch. The conclusions of this Committee, as will be seen from their report,* are that the Government of India will be • Enclosure No. 6. well advised to accept in principle the proposal of the Russian Consortium, subject to the following modifications and conditions: — (а) that the point of junction of the main through route with the Indian railway system be at Karachi, and not at Nushki; (б) that the route from Tezd to Karachi be vid Bandar Abbas and thence along the sea coast, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey; (c) that concessions be obtained for branch lines— (i) from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan, Bam and Kerman; (ii) from Mohammerah to Hamadan ; (iii) from Mohammerah to Bandar Abbas vid Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz; (iv) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan ; (d) that both the main and the branch lines in Persian territory be international, Russia and Great Britain holding a preponder ating share and Persia being admitted to participate ;mmm (f) that the pan^e of the line passing through British territory and the British zone be different from that of the lin p in the Russian zone, and that the break of gauge be at- Bandar Abbas on the liaiit of the British zone; (/) that, in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia should pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Perso-Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones. 3. We concur generally in these conclusions, except in regard to a few points as to which we find ourselves unable to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. The first point relates to the proposed internationalisation of the branch lines. Wh agree that it will be desirable to internationalise any branch lines that may be constructed in the neutral zone. But we see no necessity for treating as international any branch lines which Russia or Great Britain may decide to construct in their respective zones. We would propose, therefore, to treat the proposed branch line from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Kerman as a purely British project and to keep this question out of the negotiations with Russia, except in so lar as her support may be necessary to enable us to secure a concession from the Persian Government. 4. Secondly, we do not endorse the proposal for a branch line from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan. Such a line would be a most difficult and most costly undertaking, and would at tbe same time be quite unnecessary either as a commercial project or as a bar to German enterprise, since the construction of a line from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz and Mohammerah would cause all tbe trade to pass through Bandar Abbas and Mohammerah and Bushire would entirely lose its importance as a port. Bandar Abbas could, we believe, be converted into a good port, while Bushire can never be a good port, since all the big ships have to lie out at a distance of five or six miles from the shore. Consequently, Busbire must in the end disappear as a trade centre and a railway to Shiraz would be useless. Whether Shiraz should be connected with Ispahan or not is another matter. If the Trans-Persian line passes through Ispahan, as proposed by the Consortium, a branch to Shiraz would be advantageous from the Russian point of view, since it would provide railway communication with Shiraz which Russian trade would not otherwise have. In that case, we think that it would be desirable to make no mention of a branch from Shiraz to Ispahan at present. If, on the other hand, the Trans-Persian line is to avoid Ispahan, as proposed by the Russian Government, it would be greatly to our advantage to have a connection with Ispahan, since our trade would be able to pour in from Bandar Abbas via Shiraz. We think, therefore, that it would be better to take no action in regard to this branch line until it is known moro certainly whether the Trans-Persian line is to pass through Ispahan or not. 5. Thirdly, we disagree with the Committee as to the necessity for pro ceeding with the construction of the Mohammerah-Hamadan line simul taneously with the construction of the main line. Such a branch would be useless for practical purposes, since it would have to compete with the Baghdad-Khanikin line and the Trans-Persian Railway. A line from Julfa to Mohammerah would have been useful as a counterpoise to the Baghdad Railway in the absence of the more comprehensive scheme now proposed, but it has quite lost its value now that the Trans-Persian Railway is to be the counterpoise. We think, therefore, that the Mohammerah-Hamadan concession should be obtained merely for the purpose of ear-marking, as against any attempt to connect the Baghdad Railway extension with the Gulf by this route. 6. Finally, we are not persuaded, on the information contained in the Committee’s report, that the practical difficulties of the alignment proposed by r Colonel Cox (namely, from Yezd to Karachi via Kerman, Bam, Regan, Bampur, Sarbaz and Kej) are so serious as to make it necessary to adopt the more circuitous route rid Bandar Abbas, and we have some doubt whether the latter route would prove acceptable to the Russian Government. We would preieltherefore to reserve our opinion as to the respective merits of the Yezd- Bandar Abbas-Karachi and Yezd-Kerman-Karachi alignments until these two routes have been examined locally by a railway engineer. 7 . With these reservations, we commend the Committee’s proposals to the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government and have only to add that, in our opinion, it is very desirable, if the Trans-Persian Railway is to be made at all, that it should be commenced as soon as possible, so that it may be completed some time before the Baghdad Railway. The line will then have acquired a certain amount of trade and traffic that would naturally fall to the line that is first completed. 8. We have made no suggestions as to the financing of the proposed line, as this is a matter which His Majesty's Government will probably wish to reserve for discussion in England. But we endorse the recommendation of the Committee that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain in connection with the project should be shared equally between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Proposed linking up of Russian and Indian railway systems by a line through Persia. As I understand the position, we must now assume complete good faith on the part of Russia under the Convention and abandonment of former designs on India. We cannot, therefore, take our stand on fundamental objec tions of Indian strategists against connection of Indian and Russian railway systems. If above premise is conceded, it seems to me that an attitude of mere benevolent neutrality will hardly suffice and might be dangerous, and that, bavin 0 * exercised right, which the promoters concede to us, of constructing the line from Kerman southwards, we should support the present proposal to the extent of co-operating in the thorough examination of project from business and engineering points of view. But although the bogey of Russian designs on India is laid for the present veneration, we cannot advisedly ignore the strategical aspect of the connection via Seistan altogether, and in this connection I cannot understand the dictum in letter from India Office to Foreign Office, dated 23rd December 1909, to the effect that the strategical objections are equally insuperable, whether the line proceeds from Kerman via Nushki or across Mekran and thence near the coast to Hyderabad. I submit that an alignment from Kerman via Bam, Ri ff an Bampur, Serbaz, thence across the frontier near Kej, and so on to Karachi or Hyderabad would be infinitely less open to strategical objection and would also be a much more profitable line of country^ to tap.^ If the line actually touched the coast, it would do so^ in British territory at Gwetter or Pasni, or at Gwadur by arrangement with Maskat. Furthermore, this alignment would provide effective means for checking the arms traffic through Mekran, and for exercising influence with the Baluchistan Chiefs connected therewith. Assuming that we agree to oo-opevate, there remains the question of keep- in? Germany out of the neutral zone, and preventing her from profiting by a iunction of the Baghdad Railway with the Anglo-Russian through route. Granted the good faith of Russia as regards designs on India, there is nothing to prevent a pro-German epidemic in Petersburgh from encouraging Germany to undertake active enterprise in the neutral zone and thus weaken our present predominant position therein. This contingency seems conce.vaoly oossible at the present time. The above considerations seem to me to make Ft essential that we should stipulate with Russia that as an anterior condition of our co-operation in promoting the through route, she must first join us in obtainin'’' a concession for the Mohammerah-Julfa line and agree to commence the section from Mohammerah to Ramadan immediately she agrees to connect fte Khanikin branch of the Baghdad Railway with the Russian system ma Kermanshah.

From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your endorsement No. 2604 E.-A. of 3rd December 1910, in which I am desired to furnish my views on the proposed scheme for the connection of the European and Indian Railway systems by the construction of a line across Persia. 2. The lack of complete information regarding the country through which the proposed line is to run ; the absence of reliable data and statistics of its potential possibilities, or even its existing trade requirements, render it impossible to deal with the present problem on the usual lines. Any detailed forecast of the financial results of the line or its general effect on Persia and adjoining countries is at present impossible. All that can he done in these circum stances is to treat the subject on broad lines and endeavour to arrive at general conclusions. 3. Impartial consideration of the subject is moreover hampered at the outset by the fact that we, as a nation, have always been accustomed to « insularity ”, and have so long endeavoured to maintain the insularity of our Indian Empire, by an impassable barrier of buffer States, and that we cannot be expected to accord a welcome to any scheme which threatens to invade our isolation and bring us, as the proposed railway must do, into direct contact by rail with the outer world. So strong is the natural tendency to oppose any change from existing conditions, that there is every danger of our failing to recognise in a proposal such as the present one, advantages which would be self-apparent to other European nations or even our own Canadian Dominion, to whom intercommu nication by railway with adjoining countries is an accepted condition of ordinary In our effort to consider the problem without undue bias we must, however, endeavour, when steering wide of the Scylla of unreasonable opposition, not to shipwreck on the Charybdis of blind acceptance. 4. However anxious we may rightly be not to expedite a new order of things, we must admit the futility of expecting that the present want of com munications with, and in Persia, can much longer prevent access to the world’* trade, or form a barrier to European nations in their rivalry for new and larger markets. No less necessary is it to recognise the risk that, if we decline the opportunity now afforded, of a joint arrangement with Russia, to open up Persia by railway to the advantange of our mutual trade, Russia may be compelled, by the necessities of the new situation created by the coming Baghdad Railway, to make joint railway arrangements with some other Power in which our advan tages and requirements would be ignored. We should doubtless in the end be C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. life.2 compelled to face the very evils we now wish to avoid, and connect our Indian Bailway system with one which might not receive us in an amicable spirit or on favourable terms. It is obviously essential to recognise the above contingency, before proceed ing to consider the present proposal, because arguments of a political, com mercial, and military nature, which may now be urged against its adoption, may he no less cogent at the moment when necessity hereafter compels us to stultify ourselves by ignoring them. 5. It is proposed to connect the Bussian and Indian Bailway systems by a line from Baku through Persia to India. The line will probably leave the coast of the Caspian near Enzeli, some 250 miles east of Baku, and pass through or near Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman. Prom Baku to the Indian border of Persia, the line will he about 1,100 miles in length. 6. Prom the commercial point of view it is obvious that the line will benefit Bussian trade to an enormous and preponderating extent. As stated by the authors “ all the freights of the Volga will get a considerable advantage over foreign goods over a great part of Persia.” The force of this statement is the more self-evident, if one remembers that goods from the Caspian littoral and the Volga need not take to the railway at Baku, but can be water borne as far as Enzeli, thus further diminishing the rail journey by over 200 miles. It will be difficult for British goods to compete in these circumstances with similar Bussian goods in any part of interior Persia. To give British trade any fair chance of competing at all, it will be necessary to construct branch lines northwards to meet the central line from the coast. That from Bandar Abbas to Kirman appears the one to be built first, as being within ottr own sphere and therefore to be under our sole control. Others from Ahwaz to Ispahan and Bushire through Shiraz will doubtless follow in due course. 7. It is not only in Persia itself, however, that the line will benefit Bussian trade, for it will open out to it many fields of commercial enterprise in India. The following table of comparative distances of a few places selected at random will suffice to illustrate this:— Baku to Quetta Baku to the Indo-Persian frontier Enzeli to Quetta Enzeli to the Indo-Persian frontier Calcutta to Quetta ... Calcutta to Peshawar Bombay to Peshawar (by rail) ... Bombay to Quetta (by rail) Bombay to Delhi Karachi to Peshawar ... .o. Quetta to Lahore ... . M Quetta to Kirman ... ... Quetta to Delhi Quetta to Yezd ... , Quetta to Karachi » 1,500 miles. 1,100 1,300 800 1,700 1,500 1,500 1,300 1,000 1,000 ‘800 800 900 900 600 8. The same table, however, serves to illustrate the advantage which will accrue to Indian trade from the proposed line, and it may be confidently expected that a very great impulse will be given thereby to Indian trade throughout Persia. The distance by rail from Delhi to Yezd, it will be observed, is but little more than from Bombay or Calcutta to Peshawar or Quetta. 9. We have as yet only considered the Persian railway from the aspect as a trade carrier, and it is now necessary to consider it in its more important f3 aspect of a trade producer. In an isolated and undeveloped country, such as Persia, the introduction of a railway line cannot fail to have most important and far-reaching effects on trade. It must inevitably, as has been the case in every country in the world, lead to the development of agriculture and other natural resources, and nowhere perhaps do greater possibilities or room for such development exist than in Persia. There are vast tracts of good land everywhere lying unused and only needing the small capital necessary for reopening the old Karezes by which they used to he irrigated. Nearer India, it will pass close to the existing fertile tract of Seistan, whose wealth of surplus products will at last find a market. This must automatically lead to the rapid development of that rich country and further swell the volume of local trade. Next will follow in the natural course of events the exploration and develop ment of the mineral resources of the country, which are known to exist, but which, through want of transport facilities, have hitherto not been considered worth investigating. Last hut not least, the existing local products of Persia, such as ghee, hides and grain, wool, &amp;c., which either absence or cost of transport have made it impossible or unprofitable to export, will become available for export and thus will be removed what is now the principal impediment to Persian trade deve lopment, i.e., the dearth of exports for the payment of imports. These are great and solid advantages which will benefit British, Russian and Indian trade alike. They should go far to compensate, through increased bulk, British and Indian trade for the more favoured position which the new line will give to Russian trade in its competition with ours. 10. It will, however, be imperatively necessary, in order to prevent Russia deriving more than its proper share of these and other trade advantages, to take steps to ensure British and Indian trade obtaining an equal start as regards time Unless strenuous steps are taken Russian trade will be able to make use of the new line before we can do so, and it will be difficult for us to make up for lost time. The line should therefore be commenced simultaneously from both ends. Russia can commence the railway at her own door, whereas we have yet to traverse a wide stretch of country to reach the Persian frontier. It is there fore essential to extend our Indian Railway system to Persia by the shortest and easiest route and to do so in the least possible time. The only route which meets these requirements is that to Nushki. Military and commercial reasons will ultimately necessitate a line from Karachi, but it will be unwise to use that route in the first instance. Prom the valuable’ railway reconnaissance made by Mr. Johns in ^ 1903, it will be seen that a line from Nushki to the Persian border, 360 miles in length, admits of Q.viri ranid eonstruction. It is estimated that it could be built within length, cost * 750 lakhs and taKe some o years ^ ^ Karachi line to sea-borne British trade would moreover be greatly minimized Pv line from Bandar Abbas or other Gulf seaport northwards. line.

MoMahob,To facilitate action when the time comes, it would appear advisable to start railway surveys from Nushkr Robat and Bandar Abbas with the least possible delay. 11. Of the financial success of the line itself I do not think that there is any reason to be sceptical. Whatever the discomfort of the long rail journey compared to that by sea to Europe from the East may be, it is but reasonable to expect that the majority of travellers will be tempted to use the former route, either from motives of economy or from desire to traverse the countries through which the line will run. This will apply not only to travellers to and from India but to those between Australia and China. The number of through passengers on which the estimate of income is based may appear large at first sight, but I do not think that it is unduly so. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that the receipts from local passengers have been under rather than over estimated. The amount of local traffic which a railway creates even in the most unpromising areas is often surprising. As an instance of this I may quote the line from Quetta to Nushki. When the construction of the line was under consideration the prospect of a remuner ative local traffic was hardly thought worthy of being taken into account owing to the seemingly uninhabited area it traversed. Nevertheless, the amount of local traffic has been such as to convert what was feared would he an unremunerative strategic line into a commercially profitable one. Similarly, there is considerable reason to suppose that the line onward will, in Persia, develop a local traffic of a more extensive and lucrative nature than that now estimated for. Incidentally the through traffic on the proposed line will tend to increase the receipts of the Indian systems to a very considerable extent, by attracting many passengers through India who would otherwise travel by sea without setting foot in this country. It is necessary to give due credit to this factor, and also to the additional income from the carriage of the increased bulk of Indo-Persian goods on Indian lines, when considering the question of guarantees to the new undertaking. 12. It is necessary next to regard the proposal from the political and mili tary point of view. This can best be done together, as the difficulty of separat- ing political from military considerations is very considerable, and for this reason only do I venture to trespass on military ground. We are now brought face to face with new problems, and strong though the inclination may be to avoid their consideration by opposing the proposal ab initio, it is necessary to tackle them seriously and impartially. In the first place, the proposed railway line through Persia involves the necessity of ensuring its safety throughout its length. It is unreasonable to expect a lucrative passenger or goods traffic, if the line has to run, in turn, the gauntlet of Bakhtiari brigands or disappointed and exasperated Afghan gun runners. It will have to be safeguarded from both. The existence of the line will itself facilitate measures for dealing with troubles of this nature, but the real difficulty which the protection of the line involves is one common to several other questions connected with its construc tion and maintenance, i.e,, its relation to the future of the Persian Government. In this case the adequate protection of the line affects the future not only of a railway but of a^ nation. On the ability of the Persian Government to meet its responsibilities in regard to the line depends the consolidation or dis integration of Persian autonomy. On this again depends the effect of the line on the military and political problems of India. Needless to say that any support we give to the present proposal should he based on the determination to prevent its adoption leading to the disinte gration of Persia, and all our efforts should be directed towards making the line a means of strengthening the authority of the Persian Government. 13. Assuming that we enter into the project only on the above under standing, we can now consider the more important problem, i.e .;— What effect will the existence of the proposed line have on our position m India ? Given assurance of perpetual continuance of amicable relations5 with Russia, the question hardly needs reply. We must, however, consider also the possible future contingency of hostility with Russia. A railway line lead ing from an enemy’s country, distant though that may be, undoubtedly intro duces sources of danger to which we are unaccustomed. As indicated in the previous remarks, the extent of the danger largely depends on the previous effect of the line on the autonomy of Persia. The proposed line moreover introduces a new factor into the problem; for Germany will have doubtless acquired access to this same line from Baghdad. It is possible to conceive conditions under which the new element might add an additional source of danger to ourselves from the new line, but it is, I think, more reasonable to suppose that it will greatly minimise future danger, because the antagonism of German and Turkish interests with those of Russia is likely both to avert hostility between Russia and ourselves, and, in the event of hostilities, to render the Persian line of less assistance and value to Russia than it might otherwise be. In the event of a combination of Russia, Germany, and Turkey against us, it would be hard to overestimate the menace which the Persian line presents to us, but at this stage it would seem superfluous to com plicate the problems of the proposed line with those of Armageddon, and it should suffice to continue to deal with this question on more familiar lines. 14. It may be assumed that we will have constructed at least one branch line from the Persian coast to meet the central line and this fact, in conjunc tion with the long length of the line from Baku or Enzeli, will deprive it of many attractions to Russia for military purposes against India. Again, and this is a still more important factor, the same line nearer India will have converted an important strategic point from being a grave source of danger into a place of great advantage to ourselves. I refer to Seistan. As long as Seistan is left as it is now, equi-distant from the nearest Russian and British garrisons, it must ever remain an attractive objective and a source of temptation to Russia, and a danger to ourselves. The con struction of the proposed railway line will bring us within such easy reach of it as to destroy all Russian hopes of its easy acquisition. Being no longer in the line of least resistance, it will lose its attractions to Russia and its danger to ourselves. On the other hand, Seistan, with its important strategic position with regard to Persia and the Helmand, would be at our disposal, and its great local resouices* would enable us to place there, when necessity arises, a force sufficiently large to render access to India by rail both difficult and dangerous. Prom a military-political point of view therefore, the proposed railway line does not seem an unmixed evil or one which should be avoided on military grounds at the expense of other important considerations. 15. Afghanistan has so far been omitted from these remarks, but a word is necessary on tne Afghan aspect of the question. The line will affect Afghanistan only from the military aspect and in proportion to the menace it represents to that country from Russia. We cannot expect Afghanistan to be pleased with railway or any other arrangements we may jointly make with Russia, as suspicion of Russia must tend to give them a significance hostile to Afghanistan. Apart from this, there is but little in the proposed project which will alarm the Afghan Government. The desirability of our improving- communications in order to co-operate in the defence of Western Afghanistan has already been clearly recognised by them. The position of the proposed line with regard to Seistan and thereby to the Herat-Kandahar route will, I consider, outweigh in the official Afghan mind any additional menace from Russia through Southern Persia. 16 Of the numerous minor difficulties which the present proposal will brino- to the front, the one which will probably give most trouble is that of guao-e Assuming that neither Russia nor ourselves will allow the other to use their standard guage, it follows that some neutral guage will have to be decided upon This involves a break of guage at both ends of the Persian line, and incidentally increases the difficulty of finding a suitable place for the entry of the line into British territory. The requirements of a large Railway terminus, establishment, staff, &amp;c., in supplies and water are not easily met on the Indo-Persian border,6 and it will probably be found necessary to take the line, even at the cost of distance and time, either to the edge of the Seistan area, or to run a short branch line northwards to that place, to supply the junction where our Kailway systems will meet. 17. In the above remarks I have endeavoured to state as impartially as possible the merits and disadvantages of the proposed railway. The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the connection of the European and Indian Kailway systems is inevitable ; that the disadvantages and dangers are not of such a nature as to justify our declining to take this opportunity of entering into the scheme by mutual agreement on amicable and thereby favourable terms, and that therefore we should give the proposal a favourable reception. The time at my disposal has been so short that I am conscious that the above remarks must be considered as a somewhat crude and inadequate treat ment of so important and complex a question. 18. The following is a brief summary ot the arguments advanced in this letter and the main conclusions arrived at:— It is unwise to expect that the present isolation of Persia can longer con tinue, or that we can indefinitely maintain freedom for India from intercom munication by rail from the West. The present proposal offers opportunities of a mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and if we decline to take advantage of it, we may be compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway connection under less favourable condi tions. The proposed railway must benefit Russian trade in much larger propor tion than British trade, but it will benefit Indian trade and largely increase the bulk of both British and Indian trade by the opening up of Persia. It will increase the receipts of Indian Railways and thereby benefit Indian revenues. The military or political disadvantages of inter-railway communication are less than might at first sight be supposed, and are largely counteracted by the access afforded by the line to Seistan. These conclusions are arrived at on the assumption that our efforts are directed to preventiug the line destroying the autonomy of Persia. On the above grounds the proposal merits favourable reception, but in order to minimize the preliminary advantages of Russia, to assist British trade, prevent Russia getting an undue start of both British and Indian trade, and for strategic purposes it is absolutely essential;— (1) To construct a line under British control, from Bandar Abbas or other Gulf port to the central line. (2) That the Indian Railway system be extended to the Indo-Persian border by the easiest and quickest route, e.e., from Nushki. (3) That work on (1) and also from the Indo-Persian border westwards should commence simultaneously with that at the Russian end. (4) That work on (2) be pushed on with speed without necessarily waiting for the commencement of the Persian line. (5) That a line be constructed in due course from Karachi to meet the central line within British limits. (6) That no time be lost in commencing the necessary railway surveys for all the above lines. Foreign Office Press—No. 448 -24-1.11—74,Enclosube No. 3. (Memorandum by the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence.) The case is sent to me for snob concrete facts as might enable the Govern ment of India to estimate the probable effect on Indian trade of such a railway as is contemplated. The question put to me is not, as I take it, whether such a railway would help trade (of course it would) or be worth making on other grounds, but whether it would help trade in some sort of proportion to the expenditure. I have therefore thought it incumbent on me to go through all the available information with such speed as has been possible. I may say at once that I have failed to constitute any statistical data that would warrant any such estimate. At the best, any estimate relating to the future is of the nature of conjecture. If I were to set the data out here I should merely waste time and incur some risk of giving rise to conclusions, discussions or hypo theses that are wide of the mark. For if one presents a mass of figures, that do not really illustrate the particular point to be considered, there is a danger that—qualify them as one may—some of them will stick. Briefly then, our information regarding the volume of trade conducted by India in the direction of Seistan and northwards under present conditions affords no indication whatever of the volume which that trade might ultimately assume in the presence of a railway and under those conditions of civilization that commonly follow a railway. 2. If any weight were to be attached to our returns, they must be held to discourage very strongly a project that involves large expenditure and other res ponsibilities. *And while it might be argued that the discouraging character of our facts is due in part to unfavourable—and abnormally unfavourable—condi tions not directly related to transportation, we have, on the other hand, been told by our Consuls that some of the progress shown by the trade statistics of this region is to be ascribed to the temporary insecurity of some other routes. 3. I also think that the Board cf Trade view of the value of the railway for trade purposes is much nearer the truth than that of Sir Henry McMahon. In fact I agree generally with the Board of Trade. But then I really have no argument that I could oppose effectively to the local knowledge of Sir Henry McMahon. And I agree with him that, having regard to the conditions under which it almost certainly would be constructed, the railway stands to do a great deal more for Russian than for Indian trade. Indian trade with Persia can be served best by railways from the seaboard. Otherwise we lose the benefit of cheap ocean carriage with its concomitant advantage of the estab lishment at the coast of an entrepdt that has many of the characteristics of a base in which trade can exercise a good deal of independence and mobility. An entrepot or base that is half way down a pioneer line of railway is not the same thing by any means. It is always more or less a point “ in the air ^ ] And if participation in this inland railway is to divert attention from the littoral lines (and it will be strange if it does not) such participation will be deplorable. I agree therefore that the immediate construction of a line to the Gulf should by one means or another be assured. How it can be assured is another matter. 4. But if it can be assured, then we may—even while concerning ourselves primarily w r ith trade—look at the new inland project with a wider view than can be obtained through the medium of trade statistics. We know that such concrete facts as are capable of exact measurement do not by themselves furnish an adequate gauge of the probable usefulness of a railway in a raw country. Nor do I think that any one can have watched the course of Persian trade (and politics) for a number of years and have studied the greatly improved reports that are now furnished by our officers in those regions without noticing? that most of the main impediments to progress of ail sorts are precisely of the kind that give way before improved communications. It is not merely a matter of improved transportation; for we know that railway rates cannot always bo made competitive with the13 charges for other forms of transport when the commodities to he handled are of comparatively low specific value or such as do not call for much expedition in getting them to their market. But^ those obstacles that consist in oM, brigandage, official and unofficial, in the difficulties related to exchange and remittance, in the corruption and inefficiency of the Courts, in the conditions of credit, in the uncertainty as to the identity, the real residence, and the solvency of one’s buyer, in the long delay that occurs between the placing and the execution of an order, and in the impracticability of efficient supervision and control of the agencies in Persia—to say nothing of the general political conditions that affect other things as well as trade, all these obstacles must almost certainly persist until a railway opens the country up. In fact it may be taken that until the country is so opened up the progress of penetration or assimilation cannot really begin and instability must continue. Under present conditions we are more or less shut out; but Bussia has been able to make better progress than we. No doubt the new railway will serve her better than it will us, but it will serve us too, and on the whole it would, I think, create a greater likelihood of our getting even with Russia than can be said to exist at present. Even if it did not better our position relatively to that of Bussia, is there any likelihood whatever that its prospect of doing so would be improved by delay ? So far as the “ man in the street” can see there is no such likelihood—quite the contrary. It is almost incredible that the more intimate “ commerce,” mercantile and social, that would attend the creation of a railway could fail to bring about some sort of assimilation of that part of Persia which is nearest our borders. I should imagine that from a political point of view this would be worth something even if the railway did not pay for a good many years. I should not expect it to pay in the literal sense until the process of assimilation had gone pretty far. For Indian trade comprises few commodities of such high specific value as would stand cumulative railway freights of a large amount, and I imagine that, in respect of these commodities, most shippers to and from Europe would prefer the greater security of transport by sea over routes that are well policed. Even in my time, the Constantinople Express was held up once or twice in Europe when it was believed that it carried much treasure. As regards trade with Persia it is fairly certain that the risk would be accepted in respect of precious stones and of specie for settlement of debts; for the conditions on our side would be a great deal better than those now present. And it is very probable indeed that the railway would carry northwards substantial quantities of textiles (silk, wool and cotton), sugar, tea, coffee and sundry |? manufactures of fairly high specific value. But I hold that even for these the natural channel would be the Gulf and the railway from the Gulf. The 31st December 1910. F. Noel Paton. Enclosure No. 4. (Memorandum by the General Staff on the proposed Trans-Persian 'Railway.) The General Staff are concerned only with the “ probable effect of the Enclosure No. 5 to Secretary of State’s despatch Scheme * * On the strategic position of th© No. 32. Indian Empire ”, In considering this strategic aspect of the proposal the General Staff wish to emphasize the fact that any material improvement of land communications towards or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India and of the Empire. When discussing the strategic problem of a possible approach of Bussian railways to Afghanistan Mr. Balfour stated : “ if Bussian strategic railways are allowed to creep closer and closer to the frontier which we are bound to defend: then this country will inevitably pay for its supineness by having to keep on foot a much larger army than anything which any of us can contemplate with equanimity. Foresight and courage can obviate these dangers, without foresight and courage they may come upon us: and if they r U any Wi js’petn: beneral supreme Coes not It i teed op jmpossib great fi' decide lie araili 3 \ strategu consequi still it India is The ad\ vliicli i being se strategic don of s (or the 1 and, as become: finding the nat upon ti may be of the G prepond adeqnatf be thr 4. from th other fa the case 5. of the I prepond of the i ments f close tc fewer c fossessii 6. Nual highest i other to t° cause Such ac *lhm?: olternati reach o[u do com? iipon us we shall be throwing upon our children, if not upon our selves, the greatest military problem that has ever confronted the Government of this country.” The figures in Appendix A show the largely increased forces which Russia will he able to develop on the North-West Frontier of India and 1 Afghanistan as soon as the proposed line is completed. 2. It is true that our present friendship with Russia renders improbable any hostile act on her part against India, hut that friendship cannot be regarded as permanent. As late as 1909 Major-General Gruloff of the Russian General Staff wrote : “ the struggle between Russia and Britain for political supremacy in Persia has been postponed but not concluded It is from this struggle that hostilities may ensue in future. The present entente therefore does not warrant the abandonment of sane and vigilant precautions. ! It will be seen then that the previous military policy of India has been based upon maintaining its strategic isolation, so that attack becomes, if not impossible, at all events so difficult and lengthy an operation as to involve very great financial strain on the attacking power, and to ensure that before decisive issue is joined, the whole military strength of the British Empire will be available. 3. While it is the duty of the General Staff to emphasize the great strategic advantage of the natural barriers in the defence of India and the consequent disadvantage of piercing this barrier at any point by a railway, still it is fully realized that a through connection by railway from Europe to India is a development of civilization which cannot be resisted permanently. The advocates of the scheme lay stress on choosing an alignment ” for which its importance for transit is its very first consideration, every thing else being secondary or auxiliary”. At the same time, while safeguarding Russia’s strategic requirements, they recognize that some alignments, e.g., the construc tion of a line from Merv to Meshed, “ would be strategically rather dangerous for the English”. They evidently therefore anticipate difficulties on our part, and, assuming that a line will ultimately be constructed, the problem becomes one of rendering it as strategically innocuous to India as possible, by finding some artificial obstacle which will in some measure take the place of the natural barrier which it is proposed to pierce, so that the strain thrown upon the military resources of the Empire in the event of foreign aggression may be neither too sudden nor too severe for them to hear, in the opinion of the General Staff such a substitute can only be found in making use of our preponderating sea power, as a means of control of the proposed line and in adequate fortification, at some distance from the frontier of India, of a naval ). base through which the proposed line must run. 4. So far in this memorandum the problem has been considered solely from the local point of view of the defence of India from aggression, but other factors of importance demand attention in connection with this aspect of the case. 5. It has been a cardinal point of our strategy to retain strategic control of the Persian Gulf. If any sea Power other than Great Britain should obtain preponderance or even a secure base in the Gulf, it is clear that the problem of the defence of Indian ports and the safety of transports bringing reinforce- jnents from home would be at once made more difficult. A railway passing close to the littoral and under control of any other Power would afford that Power claims to a port on the Gulf which will he hard to resist. From the possession of a port to the formation of a fortified base will be a natural step. 6. Should Russia adhere “ to her usual policy of cautious absorption” by a gradual occupation of the provinces of Herat and Afghan Turkestan, the highest authorities are of opinion that we should be forced at some period or other to adopt the Kabul*Kandahar line in our plan of defence, and that action to cause the invader to evacuate Afghanistan would have to be taken elsewhere. Such action will be facilitated, if we can, by the selection of a suitable j alignment for this railway and the permanent exclusion of any possible alternative alignment, cause Russia to expose to u&amp; a vulnerable point within reach of our sea power.7. The approach of the Baghdad Bailway to the Gulf gives another factor that requires consideration. If the Power exploiting that line succeeds in obtaining a terminus on the Gulf, the extension of the railway through Southern Persia towards India will probably be pressed. Such an extension under the auspices of a Power potentially hostile to Great B itain will greatly complicate ©nr strategic position. Advantage should be taken of the opportunity now* offered of obtaining guarantees that such extension will be under our control. 8. Of minor importance is the consideration that the proposed railway through Persia must break gauge at some point, for the Russian and the Indian systems are on different gauges. This break of gauge will be the weak link in the advance of an enemy along that line. Hence the break of gauge should ho under our control and should be as far distant as possible from India. 9. If then the strategic disadvantages of the proposed connection are out weighed by other factors, the General Staff consider that the following condi tions should be fulfilled :— (1) The line should he so located that it can he controlled by our sea power through a large portion of its length. (2) Measures should he included in the schen e which will impose an artificial obstacle to the advance of any hostile power along the line towards India as a substitute for the present natural barriers of mountains and deserts. (3) The complete control of the Gulf should he retained and secured to Great Britain. (4) Advantage should be taken of the opportunity to prevent the possi bility of any third power securing, at some future time, conces sions on or near the Gult littoral. (5) The break of gauge should be distant from tbe frontier of India and under the control of Great Britain and within reach of her sea power. (6) No connection between this line and either Afghanistan or Northern Baluchistan should be permitted. (7) The extension of Russian or Persian Railways through Afghanistan should be more strongly resisted than ever. 10. To fulfil the first of these conditions it is essential that the railway line should follow the coast for a considerable portion of its length. 11. To comply with the second, the line must pass through some position suitable for the construction of a fortress of unquestioned strength and offensive power based on the sea. 12. T o meet the third condition Bandar Abbas and Kishm Island must be controlled by Great Britain and garrisoned by British or Indian troops. Purther in conformance with the fourth condition the railway concession should stipulate that any branch lines to the Gulf should be made only with the consent of Great Britain and under guarantees that the ports will not be fortified by any other Power. 13. The various alignments are considered in detail in Appendix B. It will be seen that the only alignment that offers suitable substitutes for the strategic disadvantage of the abandonment of the present policy of the strategic isolation of India is that via Yezd to Bandar Abbas (direct) and thence along the coast to Karachi. But this alignment is in itself very far from being a sufficient safeguard. Bandar A.bbas must be J or tilled and garrisoned permanently by sufficient troops to prevent any. attempt to secure it by a coup de main. W ithin the fortifications should be the break of gauge of the railway. It is by these measures and by these measures alone that we can prevent the construction of a through railway from Europe to India being accompanied by such strategic disadvantages as would demand a very large increase to our military forces both in India and at home. 14. It will be noted that in Appendix B reference is made to a proposal to construct a line from Karachi to beistan. The General Staff consider that16 Seistnn may become a place of great strategic importance in a campaign such as is now being considered. They desire to urge that its possession by us should j be assured by the construction of this line simultaneously with that through Persia, and that the advantage of its possession by Russia, if they anticipate us, should be nullified by a decision never to extend the Nushki line to Seistan. 15. It remains to consider what will be the strategic position if these measures are given effect to. It will he seen from Appendix A, that Russia can develop forces of great numerical superiority to those at our disposal. If r.dl-bead of the Trans-Persian connection is brought to Nushki, the ultimate victory of Russia can only be a matter of time. But if the alignment is brought through and controlled at Bandar Abbas, the position is far less un favourable. Ror if owing to the difficulties of moving large forces far from rail ways and the slowness with which such railways can be constructed, Russia should attempt an advance on India along the Trans-Persian railway as a single line of advance, she would be confornted by a fortress based upon our whole sea power. The historical instances of the lines of Torres Vedras and of Port Arthur show the possibilities for the defensive in such a position. If she attempted an advance on the Herat-Helmund line combined with an advance on the Trans-Persian alignment, Great Britain would have all the strategic advantage of interior lines. The proposed connection from Karachi to Seistan will enable Great Britain to occupy a strong flank position which Russia could not ignore. If neglecting the Trans-Persian alignment, she were to advance on the Herat and Kabul lines alone, her interest in Persia would be open to our attack and our position in the theatres of Afghanistan would be strengthened by the Karachi-Seistan connection. 16. The commercial aspects of the scheme are not for the General Staff to consider, but it is permissible to point out that their proposals coincide with the views of the Board of Trade who consider that a line to a well known Gulf port, preferably Bandar Abbas, is a %ine qua non. In the strategical study of the North-West Frontier of India it is cal culated on the assumption that all forage required for transport animals can he obtained locally in the country and will not have to be brought from Hussia, that the Russians can develop the following forces on the different lines of After four months both sides have the maximum forces necessary concen trated in the front line and are consolidating their positions, collecting supplier and advancing rail-heads preparatory to a final advance to serious engagements. Where these will take place north of the Hindu Kush it is difficult to predict. It will depend on many conditions such as the season of the year, &amp;c.

(4) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Kerman-Yezd-Tehran. (5) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Yezd (direct)-Tehran. (6) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Shiraz-Julfa. The Nushki alignment is the one proposed in the enclosure to the Secre tary of state’s despatch. It is at no poition of its length subject to control by the sea power of Great Britain. It would enable Russia in the event of war to turn the Kandahar anJ Quetta positions an I to develop on the borders of India a force far stronger than we could oppose with Indian troops alone and to do so probably before wo could obtain reinforcements from homo. It is for this reason that the General Staff urge that no extension of the Nushki line should ever be undertaken. There is no position on this route suitable for a strong fortress that could delay the advance &lt; f Russia’s land forces. This alignment possesses in fact every strategic disadvantage. The Karachi-Seistan- Tehran alignment comes within the control of sea power at Karachi, hut it possesses nearly all the disadvantages of tie Nushki connection. The portion from Karachi to Seistan direct would be however advantageous to India as it would facilitate the movement of reinforcements I from home to the theatre of war near Seisian. The Karachi-Charbar-Kerman n\\zT\m&lt;ent is controlled by sea power as far as Charbar, but the alignment at Kerman is dangerously close (200 miles) j to Seistan. In the event of an advance by Russia her forces operating from • the railway at Kerman and from Kushk p'st would be able to concentrate in overwhelming force on Sei'tan and thence to advance on India. Ihe Ilelmund position would be turned by the force from Kerman au l we should be forced to accept decisive battle at the very gates of India near Quetta with imerior forces. As regards the two suggested alignments (4) and (6) the military objee* tions appear to be— The Kerman alignment brings Russia within 260 miles of Seistan and has the same ob jections as route (3). The Shiraz alignment is open to control by sea power throughout the Greater portion of its length, but the power administering the hue will absorb almost at once the Persian littoral. This alignment would effectually check German extension into Persia. But if at anv time Germany and Russia formed an alliance against Great Britain, India would be very gravely threatened by it. .The Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Yezd {directJ-Tehran alignment has the fewest strategic di&gt;advantages in being most open to attack from the sea ana in leading away from our position at Quetta and it is, therefore, advocated. ENCLOsrnE No. 5. (Memorandum by the President of the Bailway Board) The proposal appears (according to the papers received under Secretary of State’s despatch JNo. 32, dated 4th November 1910) to be lli To build a railway from Baku ria Resht, Tehran, Kurn, Ispahan ' ' a nd Yezd to Kerman and across the desert to Seistan, where a junction would be made with a line to be made by India from Nushki.The memorandum drawn up hy the Russian Consortium recognises Seistan as the point of junction as it states “ tlie nearest point of the British Indian system is Nushki from where the English are carrying a line to Scistan *\ (2) The line to be built as an international one by Russia, France and England. 2. The Secretary of State asks that the scheme be considered by the Gov ernment of India both from the commercial point of view and also in respect to its immediate local consequences. He also requests that the Government of India will take into consideration the question of the railway connec tion between the Russian and Indian systems in general. 3. Taking first the commercial and immediate local consequenoas, it may be said that— (#) As a through line connecting India and Europe, the proposal has'no claim to any merit from the Indian commercial point of view. The possibility of goods traffic being carried by the line between England and India is quite out of the question. (if) The difference in length between the rail and sea route to India, taking Karachi as a centre, will be very small, and the sea route will alway s be by far the cheaper in cost of transport of goods, besides being more convenient and also shorter to places in the south of India. (iii) As regards passenger traffic, the volume of such traffic between England and India is of no great magnitude, and it would be years after tbe proposed line had been built, before a well- organised service could be installed between Calais and Ind’a, over the many different lines with various breaks of gauge over which it would have to run in Europe. Moreover, a passenger to any part of India except the north would find that when he had added the cost of his railway ticket from Nushki to his destina tion in India, the total cost of his rail ticket from Calais to destination in India would he higher than the steamer fare which he would have to pay, as steamers have at the present time a large margin within which to reduce their fares. In regard to passenger traffic between England and India the prac tical effect of tbe building of the railway will probably be that steamer fares will be reduced and they will still retain the traffic, further passenger traffic between Europe generally and India must be small. There is no emigration traffic, such as the Siberian line carries and much revenue from this class of business could not be expected. 4. The Siberian Railway cannot be taken as a parallel case on which any assumption can be built. The Siberian Bail way route shortens the distance between the centre of Europe and the Far East by a half. Moreover it gives a direct railway route, much shorter than the sea route, to an area of country infinitely larger than India comprising, as it does, the important ports of China and Japan. The passenger traffic over the Siberian Railway is most cosmopolitan in character and of very consid Table volume, due to the big interest which most of the European countries have in the Far East. 1 travelled the Siberian line from Port Arthur to Moscow in iyU4), there were express through trains running every other day, the Wagon Hits Company providing every alternate train between Irkutsk and Moscow. Since 1901, the traffic has still further increased and the Wagon Lits Company now run their trains; there were also daily trains running at slower speed. 6. In addition to^ the through passenger traffic the Siberian line serves most important towns U Asiatic Russia, and affords a convenient means of transport of goods to areas which before could only have beefi served by a long sea route and a troublesome land journey by cart.7. Other points of difference could be indicated, showing the advantages of the Siberian Railway as a through route as compared to the usefulness of a- line connecting India with Russia; but the main difference i« that the Siberian line connects Europe by a short route with a larsje cosmopolitan population in the Far East, and opens up a cheaper route th?in the sea route lor trade commodities, whereas the use of the through line between Russia and India only offers an alternative route to passengers between England and India with the disadvantage of a convenient and cheaper sea route to compete against,, serving all the ports and different parts of the coast of India. Asa through line, therefore, between England and India, the scheme commercially has nothing to recommend it as a means of carriage either for goods or passengers. 8. Considering now the position of the line as a commercial proposition, from the point of view of its probable local traffic and the stimulus which it? would give to the consumption of articles of foreign manufacture in Persia, a development of trade would certainly follow the construction of the line, hut it does not necessarily follow that English trade would benefit much by it It seems obvious that Russia, and other European countries adjacent, would have- a great advantage over England in developing the trade of Northern and West ern Persia, but India should secure the trade of Southern Persia and Seistan. 9. As a railway proposition, however, it is not a scheme which one could rocommeud the Government of Ionia to have anything to do with from the financial point of view ; but the line is one of quite an unusual character and it has to be considered from other points than those affecting railway finance. 10. The attitude of India towards the scheme must obviously be largely based on the political situation. It seems clear that both Russia and Germany^ intend exploiting Northern and 'Western Persia and, if this cannot be avoided, the main point for consideration would see n to be to decide how the inevitable- can be turned to some use for India and the Empire as a whole. 11. In the original Russian note, enclosure No. 1 to Secretary of State’s despatch No. 32, dated 4th November 1910, great stress is 1 dd on the neces sity for the project being international. The words used are “ ue could hardly hope for success if we started by dividing the line geographically into a Russian section in the Russian sphere of influence, and an English section in the English sphere”. From the telegram from the Secretary of State, dated the 30th December, however, it seems probable that Russia and Germany aro coming to terms, which looks very much as if the international character of the through line would be put m the background, Russia with Germany’s consent making the line a Russian one in North Persia. 12. That North Persia will be opened out by a railway which will either be international or Russian seems certain and what India has now to do is to take advantage of the present position to consolidate itself in Southern Persia. The c urse indicated seems clear, and it is to welcome cordially the proposed through line as an international railway and to agree at once to make as part of the Indian Railway system a line from Nushki to some phnt in Seistan which is suitable for a junction with the international railway, 13. The ready acceptance by India of the international scheme would be a' useful card in the direction of counteracting the negotiations now in progress between Russia and Germany which may lea l to .Northern Persia being opened out by a Russian railway wi h the same objects as were in mind when the Manchurian line was constructed to Port Arthur. 14. At the same time it would politically seem to justify India taking immediate steps to begin making the line from Nushki to Seisran, as practical evidence of its desire to carry out the international scheme and to do its share as soon as possible. Whatever might be the eventual outco ue of the proposed through line, India, at any rate, would have secured access on its own rails to Seistan and South Persia, whether the through line were made or not. 15. The line from Nushkt to Seistan, which should be made solely by India must cross over the border and have its terminus in Seistan at a place suitable ior a big railway terminus for reasons of practical railway working.16. The point of junction between the international railway and the Indian system of railways will be a place of large importance, and an essential condi tion is that it should be at a site where an ample supply of water was available, both for residential and railway working purposes, and this can only be found in Seistan. 17. Incidentally it may be remarked that there should be a change of gauge at this point of junction, and it would be as well at this stage to leave undecided the question of the gauge to be finally adopted between IVushki and Seistan, as a smaller gauge than that adopted for the international line has considerable advantages as regards the difficulties of converting it to a wider gauge if the line was in the future ever likely to be made use of for purposes of the invasion of India. 18. The policy proposed would not place on India a financial risk of a character different to what she has cheerfully embarked on in the past in respect to frontier railways. Up to the present time a sum of approximately 25 to 30 crores of rupees have been spent on lines essentially made for military reasons. A sum of half a crore of rupees has only just been recently spent on the Loi-Shilman Railway, in order to provide a line still incomplete and ending at a place that makes it of no practical use for any purpose either military or commercial. 19. In the case of the proposed line from Nushki, it could he extended to Seistan for a sum of three crores of rupees approximately. For such an important political object three crores is a very small sum. Besides tins, granted a stable government in Persia, Seistan is a valuable area to tap by a railway, a matter which, I believe, has been dealt with fully by Sir Henry McMahon in his report on Seist iu. 20. The Nushki-Seistnn route seems the best to adopt for linking up the Indian Railway system with the international line for the following reasons:—- (a) It falls in with the proposals of the Russian Oonsorlium and its construction by India would not excite any particular comment and be considered as simply carrying out a scheme that had already been decided on. The route would lie for practically the whole length in territory under British influence, Persian territory only being entered upon to the extent necessary to carry the rails to the site most suitable in Seistan for the establishment of the big junction station contemplated there. (5) On the other hand, a line from Karachi to Seis^an traverses an extremely difficult country and would be costly to build and work. The Karacbi-Randar Abbas alignment would most probably give rise to very considerable political objection on the part of Russia. It would be avoiding the direct route and its cost would be very heavy indeed. It would also probably be urged that the adoption of this alignment was obviously with the intention ol placing India in a specially favourable position as regards South Persia. (c) The Nuskhi-Seistan line will be far cheaper, the probable figures of cost based on Mr. Johns* reconnaissance would probably be — ... 3 crores of rupees; ... 7 4 ditto. ... 20* crores of rupees; assumed figures; it would cer tainly be more than the line to Seistan. The cost of this line would be extremely heavy, running as it would do across the hills coming down to the sea and having to pass over a great many creeks and estuaries. x'. uauty.i lu oeisian Karachi to Seistan ... Karachi to Bandar Abbaa Siucv estimated at U crores, vide euclosure ^o. 7.22 From the point of view of railway working tlie route vid Nushki would involve all traffic being carried up to the Quetta plateau and down again, but similar eonditiors would prevail with Karachi- fceistan line as the country between these places rises to the same heights as the Quetta plateau. 21. With regard to the probable cost of the whole international railway, tho only information that may throw sonrn light on this point is a note by Captain He pkins on the country between Seistan and Kerman. The note in question does not give any estimate of the probable cost of making a railway between these two points; but the section of the ountry given shows its heavy character, and I estimate that a line between these two points would cost 2^ lakhs a mile, or for 300 miles the sum of 7J crores of rupees. 22. Considering this figure and the nature of the rest of the ountry to he traversed between Kerman and the Russian frontier, it seems highly probable that the cost oi the proposed international railway from Seistan to Baku will be very much higher than 20 mil.ion pounds. 1 fancy that 30 to 40 millions sterling would be nearer the mark. 23. There n:e other railway points that require to be touched on, assuming the international line does take shape. The Germans may be relied ) on to make eve^y oifort to connect their Baghdad lino with the proposed inter national line, arm they would then compete for North and Western Persian traffic, and probably also aim at a line parall 1 with tt’e Persian Gulf coast and eerving all the ports there. The promoters of the international line should, therefore, insist a* pa&gt;'t of the concession to be given by Persia that they should hold the s&lt; le rigtit of railway construction in Persia, India having the right to make its lino from Nushki to such point in Seistan as would afford a proper and suitable terminus for the junction of the Indian railway system with the international railway. 24. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has touched on this con tingency, and liis remedy is for Russia to press for certain branch line con cessions in the noitli, and for England to do the same for branches in the south. I venture to suggest that, if the main through line is to be interna tional, it should follow that all branches off and to it in Persia should also be international, as ibis seems to be the only way in which British trade in Northern Persia and now delivered at and exported from Gulf and ports by Bea could he preserved. 25. W : th the branch lines in the north belonging to Russia, English trade would he treated differentially, whereas under our methods we should make no distinction of country, in the rates which we should charge for goods over our branches. By insisting on branches being all international equal treatment would be preserved for the countries interested internationally in the line, and it would be possible under the international arrangement to treat the countries owning the line preferentially. Moreover, insisting on all branches in Persia being part of the internati-mai arrangement affords the best protection against the development of German trade in Persia, as the branches would be made in the interests of the trade of the countries concerned in the international lines and the rates to be charged would be fixed with this object. 26. In connection with this matter, it would bo advisable to insist, as part of the international scheme, on branches being made from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and from Bushire via Shiraz to Ispahan, leaving it to Russia and France to add in the north any other branches which they might like to include in the whole project. 27. The matter of rates to he quoted on the international lines would bo an extremely difficult question to deal with, as the rates would control the area which each country could command with its trade. It would seem that this important subjfct will require special treatment; but it would be useful to place on record that the rates to he charged should be the subject of special agreement between the parties holding the concession for the international lines.2&amp; To sum up I venture to think that the attitude of India towards this matter should be— (1) To cordially accept and support the proposal that an international line should be made from Seistan to Baku. (2) To assist in this project India would build at once, with its own funds, the line from Nushki to Seistan and include it in her railway system. The gauge of this line at the present time to be left to India to decide, but it he made an essential point that a break of gauge should cecur at Seistan junction. (5) The sole right to make railways in Persia should be secured by the concessionaires of the international line and all branches should be built internationally. (4) The basis on which railway rates are to bo charged should be a matter for future consideration and agreement. (5) Detailed surveys of the Nushki-Seistan should he put in hand at once. 29. If it is ultimately decided that India should support the proposed international line all branches to be made under the same international arrange ment, the branches from B tndar Abhas to Kerman and Bushire to Ispahan being essentially parts of the w hole project, if possible, it would be very advisable to urge the claim of India to be allowed to actually construct these two branches for the international Company. The international scheme in character is very like the Suez canal and Panama canal projects and enormous sums will be spent on flotation and largo profits made out of placing and carrying out contracts, and it will be a long time before the public can be educated up to taking up shares. On economical grounds, therefore, it would be of advantage to have these two branches constructed by Indian agency, and it would be of still greater advantage if India offered to find the money to build these two lines in pnticipation of the actual promotion of the international Company and the finding of its capital. If the international scheme fai.rd to mature, India would be left with two useful branches in Persia secured by taking advantage of the present state of affairs. 30. As an official reason why India should make these branches it might he urged that she has immense experience of the construction of railways in countries like Persia, that she has staff and material ready at band and could begin work at once and carry it out economically. T. It. Wynne, 6th January 1911i President, Railway Board,; Adrsntages and disadvantages of railway connection between Europe and India- (a) Strategical and political. Report of the Committee on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway. The proposal of the Russian Consortium on which the Secretary of State asks the opinion of the G-overnment of India, is the construction of a railway Hue from Baku to Tehran, thence wa Kum, Kashan, Yezd to Kerman, and thence to Nushki via Seistan.* It is stated that the construction of a railway in Persia is not an object completo in itself, but simply a means towards the realisation of “ a world route to unite by ons •ontiuuous line of rails Europe to India and other countries in the Ear East”. The more immediate object of the promoters appears to be the development of 1 Russian trade with, Persia, which is now threatened by the Baghdad Railway and the increasing interest of Germany in the Middle East. It is also remarked incidentally that the line would «pcure Russians strategic position in Turkey and in Western Trans-Caucasia. The line is to be constructed as an international• undertaking, the participants being Russia, Great Britain, France and possibly Persia. The cost of'construction is estimated afe' £06,950,000 roubles and the possible profits at 15 per cent on the subsciibed capital. The Government of India are asked for their views on the question of railway connec tion in general and the particular proposal put forward iu the Rusbian memorandum, and their advice is specially asked upon the commercial aspects of the project, and its immediate Local consequences. £. It may be convenient at the outset to offer a few observations on the general question of the jsrws and cons of a connection by land between Europe and India by way of a Trans-Persian Railway. The question may first be considered from the point of view of the defence of' India against foreign invasion. By the operation of the Anglo-Russian Convention we are secured for the present from the fear of a Russian invasion oc India, but in the nature of things the possibility of hostilities with Russia at some future d de canuot altogether be ignored. In view of this possibility it is clear that any material improvement of land communications towards or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India,—responsibilities which are already inconveniently heavy. From the purely strategical point of view therefore it would undoubtedly be preferable that India should maintain her ^avi-insular position and should refuse to co-operate in any scheme which would tend to facilitate the transportation of a hostile Power up to or across her irontier. We recognise, however, that the march of events in the Near and Middle East renders it impossible that this position of isolation can be indefinitely maintained. The advent of the Baghdad Railway combined with the impotence of Persia must inevitably disturb the status quo, while the prospect of a Russo-German combination in the event of our refusal to co-operate in the Russian scheme compels us to reconsider the position from a wider outlook. From this standpoint it seems to us desirable to seize the opportunity which the present proposal offers £or securing the conditions which we consider essential rather than to wait until circumstances may force us to permit the connection on terms which may be less advantageous. 3. With regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, we ^ commercial, are in general agreement with the opinions expressed in the letter from the Board of Trade to the Foreign Office of L3th September 1910 and in Mr. Worthington’s memorandum forwarded ^herewith? We do not consider that there is any likelihood of goods being carried on the tail way from the United Kingdom to India or vice-versa. The cost of transport by sea, especially to the south of India, will always be cheaper than by rail, and the sea route will have the further advantage of avoiding the re-handling of the goods at a continental port and at the points at which breaks of gauge may occur. We are iuclined to doubt also whether the through passenger traffic on the railway would be of any great magnitude. The volume of such traffic between the United Kingdom and India is not very large or likely to increase in any considerable degree, since there is no emigration to India such as is carried on the trans-Siberian line; and it seems probable that a reduction in farts would enable the steam-ship companies to retain the bulk of the existing traffic. As regards the local traffic northwards from India into Persia, no doubt the railway would lead to some development of this trade, but it is imposs ble to form any estimate as to the amount of such increase in view of the wide difference between the conditions under which the traffic is now carried on and those which would be created by the existence of the railway. The natural channel for Indian trade to Persia is • A subsequent telegram from the Secretary of State, dated 30th December, shows that the Russian Cons favour an alignment via Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, but that the Russian Government prefer U Consort ium now favour an alignment via Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, hut that the Kussian Government prefer t hat th# line should run from Tehran south-east to Kerman to avoid the possible risk of eventual intersection bj a Germaa line at Ispahan. M ■gr 25 tlirougli the ports of the Persian Gulf, and we have little doubt that the construction of lines from those ports into the interior would be of much greater benefit from the purely commercial point of view than the construction of the through line. We may note here that we are unable to accept as in any way accurate the estimate given by the Consortium of the revenue that may be expected from the line. From Roubles. Net rerenue Consortium is ... anticipated by the Taking the Rouble as=Rs. 1-9-0 in Indian currency, the net revenue will be Taking working expenses at 60°/ o the gross earnings, to secure this revenue must be ...

Judging by the earnings obtained upon our Indian frontier railways, we anticipate that the gross earnings per mile per week over the whole of the proposed line can hardly be expected to exceed Rs. 120 per mile per week or ith of the Consortium's estimate. The estimate given by the Consortium of the cost of construction is also, in our opinion, an inadequate allowance. Persia is a mountainous country, labour will be scarce and communications daring construction difficult. With a line of the character proposed large profits will be expected from contracts and the supply of material, and judging from the cost of i ail way construction in country of a similar character in India, we fear that the cost of the proposed Trans-Persian connection will exceed the estimate of the Consortium by at least 50 per cent. The proposed line can, therefore, hardly be expected to prove a financial success. At the same time the existence of a railway which would open un the country could hardly fail to produce a general expansion of trade iu Persia. Improved communicati‘&gt;ns will mean the gradual removal of those obstacles to commerce arising from the disturbed state of the country; from the difficulties relating to exchange and remittance; the long delays between the placing and execution of orders; and the impracticability of efficient supervision and control of agencies. But we cannot avoid the conclusion that a line following the route proposed by the Consortium would be far more advantageous to Russian than to Indian trade, though this result might be neutralised to some extent if we were able to secure that branch lines should be simultaneously constructed to connect the Gulf ports, such as Bandar Abbas and Bushire, with the main line. We also consider that it would be essential that stipulations should be insisted upon to insure that there shall be no differential treatment on any part of the railway for the nationals of any country in respect of rates, fares or general facilities. 4i. W'hile, therefore, from the point of view of military policy there can be little quest : on that the mainten mce of the status quo would be preferable to the construction of the proposed railway, and while it seems at least doubtful whether the advantages to Indian trade would be at all commensurate with the advantages which would accrue to Russian trade with Persia, or with the financial outlay involved in the undertaking, we are nevertheless of opinion that having regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share iu the control of any railway that may be made in Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining conces sions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, the Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposals of the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may be considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade. Alignment of the main through line. 5. We will now proceed to examine in detail the various proposals which have been made and to set forth the conditions which we consider to be essential before the Government of India agree to participate in the proposed undertaking. The first question to be considered is that of the alignment of the main through line between Russia an 1 India. With the northern portion of the alignment between Baku and Yezd we are only remotely concerned, but we think it right to notice that the alignment proposed by the Consortium, viz., Tehran, Kum, Kashan, Ispahan and Yezd, is preferable on commercial grounds to the direct line from Tehran to Kerman proposed by the Russian Government, since the latter would leave untapped the important trade centres of Kum, Kashan and Ispahan. 6. Fiom the Indian print of view the important part of the alignment is that by which the railway approaches the frontier of India, namely, the portion from Yezd onwards. Three alternative routes L ave been suggested, namely,— (1) The ’ roposal of t ie Consortium, which is also favoured by Sir Henry McMahon, for a dne from Yezd to Kerman and thence across the desert to Seistan and Nushki. Length approximately 810 miles. (2) The route suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, viz.&lt; Yezd, Kerman, Bam, Re an, Barnpnr, Sarbaz, thence across the Perso-Briti-h frontier near Kej and thence to Karachi or Hyderabad. Length approximately 1.117 miles. (3) The route advocated by the Indian General Staff, viz , Yezd to Bandar Abbas and thence along the coast to Karachi. Length approximately l,34il miles.

The distance between Yezd and meat. Nushki via Kerman and Seistan is 810 miles only as compared with 1,147 and 1,341 miles between Yezd and Karachi by the other two routes: and although Karachi is immeasurably superior to Nushki as a point of junction with the Indian railway system and as a distributing centre for goods, the difference in length between the Nuskhi and Karachi routes remains an important factor in the situation. There would, it is true, be engineering difficulties to surmount in crossing the mountains which surround Kerman, and the scarcity of fresh water in the desert between Kerman and Nasratabad and between Robat and Nushki might also be a source of considerable inconvenience. But the route lies in the main through flat country w'dch, as would appear from the reconnaissance made by Mr. Johns in 1903, would present few obstacles to railway construction. It is also a point in favour of this alignment that it would give access to the rich and well-watered tract of Seistan, which, in the opinion of so well-informed an authority as Sir H. McMahon, is capable of rapid development if a market can be found for its surplus products. But against these advantages have to be set objections, both strategical and political, the importance of which can hardly be overstated. To take the political objections first— it cannot be doubted, in view of the attitude taken by the Amir of Afghanistan towards the Anglo-Russian Convention, that His Majesty will regard the construction of a railway along his southern border as a further indication of a design on the part of Russia to impair his independence, if not to absorb his territories. This aspect of the question has been touched on bv Sir H. McMahon in paragragh 15 of his report, but with all respect to his authority we doubt whether he has adequately recognised the gravity of the objection to the Seistan-Nushki alignment on this score. However baseless the idea may be, there will not be wanting advisers who will put a sinister construction on the project in its relation to Afghanistan and w- fear that the alarm and suspicion that will be engendered may give rise to tribal excitement which may prove beyond His Majesty’s power to control. The construction of the line would in fact prove to be a potent instrument in the hands of those who m &gt;ke it their business to sow ill-feeling between the British Government and the ruler and people of Afghanistan, and we apprehend that the process of restoring confidence might involve us in undesirable complications with the other Powers who will be interested in the undertaking. Even if this be avoided, there is the risk that trouble may arise between ourselves and the Amir over the distribution of the water of the Helmand on which the development ef Seistan largely depends. The strategical objections to the Seistan-Nushki alignment are even more cogent. The adoption of this route would give to Russia a railway leading directly to the frontier of Afghanistan, and would enable her, in the event of war, to turn the Kandahar and Quetta positions. It would also facilitate the transportation by Russia of a very large army across two almost waterless deserts—a task which, under present conditions and without the help of a railway, may be regarded as practically impossible of accomplishment.^ As against this, India would receive ro compensating strategical advantages. A line ,o Seistan from Nushki might to some extent assist India to control Western Afghanistan, 1 ut no point is offered from which a force from India could undertake offensive operations against Russia' while the extension of our line to Seistan would make it difficult to resist a claim on the part of Russia to connect the Trans-Caspian Railway with the proposed route, in which case she would be able to concentrate from two directions. Imally, the adop tion of the Seistan-Nushki alignment would, owing to its distance from the sea coast, completely neutralise the strategical advantage which Great Britain possesses m her naval supremacy. . * t a- These objections are, in our view, of so grave a character that the Government of India would be justified in offering the strongest opposition to the proposal for railway connection between Russia ana India via Kerman, Seistan, and the Nushki route. 7. We will now consider the advantages and disadvantages of the other two alignments which* have been suggested, namely, Yezd-Kerman-Bam-Bampur-hej-Karaehi and ^ pur-Kej-Knra- Bandar Abbns-Karachi, and would preface our remarks by explaining that information icgard- chi ^ and i3 ) Yezd iot these two routes is confined to that obtainable from the route books which furnish very E andarAbb^ inadeq ate material for judging the suitabiluy of the routes they describe for railway construe- Karachi al.gn- tion. 1 Our recommendations must, therefore, be considered as subject to modification after actual railway surveys and investigations nave been made. It is obvious in the first place that the political and strategical objections which apply to the St istan-N ushki alignment do not apply with the same force tJ either of the routes above mentioned. A line connecting Kerman or Bandar Abbas with Karachi would be ar removed from the Afghan border and would not excite the apprehensions of the Afghan people in anvneute degree, while the sel ction of the sea coast route won d enable Great Bn ain to make effective use of her naval supremacy m resisting any possible hostile attack bv wiv rd The proposed railway. It would also, as Colonel Cox points out, provide effective means for checking the arms traffic tkiougu Mekrun.

(2) In the neutral zone. 27 % Coloijel Cox mentions three possible points at which the line might touch the coast, Gwetter, Bwadur and Pasni. We have taken tlie latter as being on the more direct route. Our remarks apply with' slight modification to the routes via Gwetter and Gwadur. tender it essential that the Government of India should select the Karachi connection in preference to that vti Seistan and Nushki. Taking now the comparative advantages of the two routes ending at Karachi, we may first give a general description of the country on the Pasni,* Bampur, Bam, Kerman and Yezd alignment. The length of the route, as taken from the route books, is 1,147 miles From Karachi to Pasni (296 miles) the line would ruu iu the vicinity of the sea shore; the . grade would be level and the chief works would be those connected with the crossing of creeks and drainage from the hills. The only point of doubt in respect of this portion of the route is whether the fresh water supply for working locomotives would be sufficient. This is a matter which will need careful investi gation. At Pasni the line would turn to the north-west and running by a sloping, hilly country for 15,0 miles would cross a range 3,000 feet high, dropping beyond to a level oi 1,500 feet. From this point there would again be a steady rise till about the 800th mile where a very sharp rise would have to be faced, the line to reach Kerman having to cross a ridge 8,400 feet high and dropping into the town beyond to 5,600 feet level. From Kerman to Yezd the line would be at a high level, but with no rangjes of any height to cross. In the absence of any information as to the cost of making railways inTPersia it ia difficult to frame any estimate of the cost of this section of the line. But labour and supplies, would be scarce and, in view of the engineering difficulties of the alignment, the cost of construction and cost of working would certainly be very high. In so far as we are abl« to frame an estimate, we would put the cost cf the section between Karachi and Yezd vid Pasni and Kerman at not less than 17 crores of rupees. Turning to the alternative route, viz , from Karachi along the coast to Bandar Abbas and thence direct to Yezd, the section as far as Bandar Abbas should offer no particular difficulties as regards construction, and it would provide a level road *o ruu over. From Bandar Abba* to Yezd the general slope of the country is easy and there is no abrupt rise such as is met on j the Pasni-Kerman section. As an engineering proposition, therefore, the seciion from Bandar Abbas to Yezd does not appear to be open to any great objection. We estimate the cost of constructing the entire line from Karachi to Yezd vid Bandar Abbas roughly at 14 crores of rupees, as against 17 crores for the Yezd-Kerman-Karachi route. As a through route between Russia and India it would certainly be quicker than the Kerman route, though of o-reater length, since the easier grades would permit of a faster train service. This alignment ~ also possesses the strategical advantages— ° (1) That it avoids bringing the through line to Kerman, which is only 269 miles from the Af ghan border. (2) That the entire route from Bandar Abbas to Karachi will lie sufficiently near th* cpast to allow the co-operation of the sea and land forces of the Empire in its defence. The Bandar Abbas-Karachi coast line would, it is true, do little towards developing trade with the interior of Persia, but we would propose, if this route is adopted, that a branch line should be run either from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan and Bam with a possible later extension to Kerman. The connection of Kerman with a port on the coast by means of a branch line would have this advantage over its inclusion in the main through route that it would enable Indian commerce to compete for the south-eastern Persian market on more favourable terms than would be the case if Russia were able to transport her o-oods direct to Kerman. , ° We would recommend, therefore, that on strategical and political grounds the Govern ment of India should express a strong preference for the connection with Karachi, and that of the two possible routes connecting Karachi with the main line, they should select that via Bandar Abbas and Yezd as being the easier, quicker, more economical, and more advan tageous from the point of view of military defence. 8. We have next to consider the important question of the branch lines to be constructed iu the event of the proposals for the through route comino- to maturity. Assuming that the Kerman Seistan-Nushki alignment is rejected, there willlbe no absolute necessity from the commercial or strategical point of view for the construction of a branch from Bandar Abbas to Kerman, but, as we have already indicated, it would be most desirable that, with a view to the development of our trade with Persia, entry into the markets of south-eastern Persia should be secured by a branch line from some portion the coast within the British sphere. Whether this branch should lead from Bandar Abbas or from some other port, such as Charbar, we would leave for future decision after the routes have been examined, but we think it desirable that in the negotiations to be entered into with Russia it should be stipulated that it should be open to Great Britain to construct a branch line connecting Kerman with the coast by whatever route may prove to be the most convenient. It is further important iu our opinion to make it a condition of our acceptance of the mam proposal that Russia will support us in obtaining such concessions for branch line* (D r (*) (3) We concessit not for tlie 1 agreemei in the | must seri fore, rec Bandar securing (1) uwilli ( 2 ) (3) Th line ink grant n&lt; have ind Moham: construe practice, to make delay w 9. line. 1 regard ' mount with tl the Bat We con tunities should 1 we can prepond latter v would 1 with a obviate be decii without 10 , for the he locat fhe utn British; zone. 1 that its Bower n broader ; change w hich is . n. will he si the aligr ? their it will h toward i dealing v Plainly t ( German.;2S in the neutral z^he as will operate to exclude Germany from obtaining a predominating position in the Persian Gulf. The lines which Colonel Cox recommends are:— (1) From Mohammerah to Julfa, (2) From Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Kerman. (3) From Bandar Abbas to Shiraz. We concur with Colonel Cox as to the supreme importance of obtaining some snob concessions as a cond tion precedent to our co-operation in the main through route. We are not aware how far Russia has pledged herself to support Germany in obtaining an outlet for the Bn ghdad railwav on the Persian Gulf. But there is clearly a danger that, if an agreement is not arrived at between ourselves and Russia on the subject of branch lines in the neutral zone, Germany may subsequently obtain such a position on the Gulf as must seriously jeopardise our interests, both commercial and strategical. We would, there fore, recommend that, in addition to sunporting us in obtaining a concession for a line from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Bam and Kerman, Russia be asked to co-operate with us in securing concessions for railway lines— (1) From Mohammerah to Hamarlan, or to such point between Mohammerah and Julfa as will intersect the extension of the Baghdad Railway between Khanikin and Tehran. (2) From Mohammerah vid Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Bandar Abbas. (3) From Bushire to Shiraz and thence to Ispahan . These concessions should, we think, be adequate to prevent the intrusion of the German line into the neutral zone, provided that a guarantee is obtained from Persia that she will grant no other concessions iu this zone which are likely to compete with tlie lines which we have indicated. The lines from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Bam or Kerman and from Mohammerah northwards should, we think, be proceeded with simultaneously with ti»e construction of the main Hue; the other concessions would not necessarily be utilised in practice, but would be retained for blocking purposes. Meanwhile, it would be an advantage to make detailed surveys of all the propased routes in order that there may be no unnecessary delay when once it is decided to proceed with any particular scheme. 9 . We observe that the Consortium contemplate the internationalisation of the through line. We think that in view of the recent negotiations between Russia and Germany in regard to the connection of the Baghdad railway witn the through Persian line, it is of para mount importance that the through line should be international. Otherwise we are faced with the possibility of a Russian line being constructed through Northern Persia linked with the Baghdad railway and operating by differential rates to the detriment of British trade. We consider further that it would be an advantage, with a view to maintaining full oppor tunities for the development of trade, that all branch lines made vvituin leisia itself, should be internationalised. In ternationalis- ation of through and branch lines. As to the Powers which should he admitted to participate in these international project* we can offer no useful opinion. But we assume that Russia and Great Britain will retain a j preponderating share in the undertaking, and that any financial responsibility incuir d by the latter will be ^borue equally by the Indian and Imperial exchequers. We think also that it would be a distinct advantage to offer a certain number of shares to the Persian Government with a view both to enlist their interest in the successful working of the line and to obviate any suspicion that the project is likely to affect the integrity of Persia. Should this be decided, it would be necessary to stipulate that Persia should not part with hei shaies without the consent of Russia and Great Britain. 10. A subsidiary question which has to be considered is that of the gauge to be adopted The question for the through route, and the place where the break of gauge, if there is to lie one, should of gauge, be located. We are of opinion that from the point of view of the security of India, it is of the utmost importance that the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zone in Persi t should be different from that of the line passing through the Russian zone We also think that India should have the right to select the gauge for this section and that it shou’d be narrower than the gauge on the northern section of the line : since a hostile Power would find it much more difficult to widen a narrow gauge than to lay a line within a broader gauo-e. We think that, from the Indian point of view, the most suitable place for the change of ^auge would be at a port on the Gulf, and we recommend that Bandar Abbas, which is on the border of the British zone, be selected for t :e purpose. H Tk ere i s one f U; -ther point which we desire to mention before closing our report. It will be seen irom what has been said above that the governing considerations iu determining the alignment for the through route are, in our opinion, those connected wi'h the attitude of the Amir and the effect of the proposed railway on the problem of the defence of India. It will be for His Majesty's Government to decide bow far th. se considerations should be put forward in discussing the question with the Russian Government. But we suggest that in dealing with a matter of such vital importance to India, it would not be out of ( lace to state plainly*to the Russian Government the reasons for u hi h Great Britain is unable to assent to the Kerman-Seistan-Nushki connection and to invite a frank exchange of views on the subject.r 29 It could be explained that from the British point of vi?ur the preferable course is to maintain the strategic isolation of India and to avoid the outlay of vast sums of money on a project which offers but little prospect of financial success or of commercial advantage; that in agreeing to co-operafe with Russia in the construction of the through Hue, we are making a considerable sacrifice; and that the only stipulations we think it necessary to make are such as will safeguard the vital interests of Great Britain. In return for this sacrifice it would, we suggest, hardly be too much to ask Russia to forego once and for all any design for the extension of the Trans-Caspian Railway along the border of Afghanistan in the direction of the Indian frontier—an extension which, in tue words of the Russian Consortium, “ wordd be strategically rather dangerous for the English”. We recommend therefore that, in addition to the other stipulations which we have mentioned, the acceptance of the proposed through connection be made conditional on the giving of a pledge by Russia that she will not at any time, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, entertain or support any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Peiso-Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones. Conpimion. 12. To summarise our conclusions :—we recommend that the Government of India accept the proposals of the Russian Consortium in principle, subject to the following modific ations and conditions :— (a) that the point of junction of the main through route with the Indian railway system be at Karachi and not at Nushki; (J) that the route from Yezd to Karachi be via Bandar Abbas and thence alon® the sea coast, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey ; (c) that concessions be obtained for branch lines— (i) from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan, Bam and Kerman; (ii) from Mohammerah to Hamadan; (iii) from Mohammerah to Bandar Abbas via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz; (iv) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan ; (&lt;f) that both the main and the branch lines in Persian territory be international, Russia and Great Britain holding a preponderating share and Persia being admitted to participate; (e) that the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zone be different from that of the line in the Russian zone, and that the break of gauge be at Bandar Abbas on the limit of the British zone; (/) that in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia should pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Perao* Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones. 8lh February 1911, W.

This note was written before I had the opportunity of seeing the Merao- randura by the General Staff. It dealt entirely with the proposal of the Russian Consortium from the railway pDint of view irrespective of military and political considerations. The only point I should like to modify is my estimate of 20 crores as the cost of a line from Karachi to Bandar Abbas. From the information I then had at my disposal it appeared that the cost of the line would be very heavy. When the question was being considered subsequently by the committee I had access to route books of Persia and was able to make a section of the country alon«* the coast and obtain a more accurate idea of the cost of making a line along it. I would estimated the crores. therefore ask that the figure of 20 crores which I originally Karachi-Bandar Abbas line would cost might be reduced to 9 20*h February 1911. T. R.

A Report (No. 18 of 1911' folios 144 - 160) notes that the Government of India would do well to accept in principle the Russian proposal subject to a number of modifications. A map entitled 'Indexed Map Showing Proposed Railways in Persia' (folio 160) accompanies the report. Suggested modifications included:the point of intersection of the trans-Persian railway with the Indian railway system (British preference for Karachi); and concessions for branch lines (Bandar Abbas, Charbar, Mohammerah);the requirement that both main and branch lines in Persian territory be deemed international with Russia and Britain holding preponderant shares and Persia included as a participant;and the use of a different gauge railway in the British and Russian zones. As a quid pro quo for their support on this matter Britain expected the Russians to cease any consideration of extending the Trans-Caspian Railway to the Persia-Afghan border.Also discussed are the negotiations about a loan between the
                           Société des Études du Chemin de Fer Transpersanand the Persian Government and a suggestion that the British and French governments should guarantee a substantial loan by securing it against the crown jewels.The following topics are also discussed: the Foreign Office proposal to refer the whole question of railway development in Persia to the Committee of Imperial Defence; a draft application for the concession; a memorandum by Brigadier General A H Gordon; dispatch of instructions to His Majesty's Ambassador at St Petersberg on the attitude of the Her Majesty's Government; the view of the Sir G Buchanan on the attitude of the Russian Government to the question of alignment.The principal correspondents in the volume include: His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, the Earl of Crewe; Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, E H S Clark; His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Zachariah Cox; the President of the Railway Board; Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan.This volume includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, year the subject file was opened, subject heading, and list of correspondence references contained in that part by year.
