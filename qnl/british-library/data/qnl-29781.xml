Considerable delay in submieeien has censequently resulted* 3« The budget is submitted mere in the nature ef a statement ef income and expenditure than in the fern ef a regular balanced budget shewing the tetal assets and liablli* flea ef the State* 4* His Highness aooeunte far this by saying that it was agreed at a meeting between Celenel Fewle, Captain Alban (as Financial Adviser) and himself, in Heyember 1932 prier te my arrival, that till 1935 the budget should take this presentpresent form* Hie Hifehness nas handed me separately a private note shotting iha what he states to be the total assets and liabilities of the Muscat Government. A cepy of this note is appended ier your information. 5. The totals of receipts and expenditure in Hie Highness's budget approximate cle&amp;ely to these of R.S. Huli Ch&amp;nd's budget and beye^nd a shuiile round of postsp conse quent on the creation of the new Department 'Dewan-i-Gultan''. there appear to be no new points calling for special notice. 6. provision has been made for the payment of public debts (Bs. 16,130-13-0) due to British Subjects, nor ha,e any provision been made for repayment uJL to the Treasury of the advance (ef Ps. 15,000) taken by Hia Highness last his year in connection with^hef&amp;r trip (vide paragraph 7 ef General CeFimcnts ferv/arded /-’ith office letter He.93 dated 15/I6th January 1034). 7, His Highness has explained verbally that he propo ses to pay off the whole ef the first item this year if possible and 'will do his best' regarding the second. Regard ing the non-provision ef funds for the puipese, the Gultan states that he expects a large excess this year ever 'anti cipated revenues', out ef idiich he propesca t® apportion the amounts required. Hence he has made no actual prevision. 8. The budget as s balance sheet shotting at a glance the states total assets and liabilities, is useless. As an annual statement ef actual and anticipated receipts and ex penditure it shows that the State, if unencumbered, would be able to pay its way with a reasonable credit balance at the end of the year. 1 I I have the honour to be.

The local price of a ruscat raund (Slbs.) dry lemons is about annas 4 against over Rs.2/- couple of years fore.

A sum of Bs# 4 ,82,400/- were collected as c revenue including landing charges, sale of customs form measures. Excluding the subsidies over 30% ol the is from customs. 11. The second increase of customs duties on several ^-itional articles came into force from 5th. June 1935. Under this ^crease of customs duty Law, duty on liquors was raised to 20? ^valorem. Cn the close of the year 1935, the following other Lji nicies were chargeable at 10 advalorem. ■ l\&gt; i lems iiU &gt; -1. Carpets ^ patches &amp; clocks &amp; parts thereof. 3 * musical instruments of all kinds &amp; parts thereof. 4 * perfumery &lt;5: perfumed spirits and all kinds of toilets requisite except soap. 5 .

It will thus appear that all kinds of food stuff including even coffee, tea and sugar also cotton piece goods are atill being Charged at S^advalorem. The increase of duties has no effect on uhe ordinary human necessities and therefore has caused no cai - j 12 . It is becoming necessary to compile a customs tariff including general procedures anc practices no- in e information of the public. 1 simple rule that customs duty is pay able on articles manifested for any of the ports in this country except those landed in excess or mislanded by the steamers xor transhipment to other ports is in force. Ko transit,bond or tranship Kent arrangement exist and no export duty or other duties are [recoverable when once the import duty is paid on entry. 13.

I attach herewith a statement which has been prepared with the help of the budget estimates fur nished by the Director of Revenues and the statement of last years actual receipts and expenditure A /&amp;, * It will be observed that the tetal receipts have been estimated for 1936 at Rs 6,12,000 i.e. &amp; Rs 16,950 less than the amount estimated for 1935 and Rs 1,79,350 less than the actual receipts for that year. Subsidies. Rs 1,00,000 on account ©f ^rms Traffic Subsidy has been omitted. Customs. Rs 35,950 have been reduced as it w-r is not possible to say 'tf certainty what amount would : actually be received which greatly depends ©n the value of imports and exports. For this reason the same figures as for 193b have been estimated. Changes under other items are due to ruiner fluctuations with the exception of item 14(d) rient of landing grounds under which arrears of rent were received in 1935 which showed an increase of ^35,550 over the estimated figure of 8s 6,650. . - j The expenditure remains^the same as estimateo for 1935 KkxKiifcxaxxMxEfiaHgKS the difference ®f % 8,650 is due the t. the fact that thexxhai* a part of Aims Traffic Subsidy (Rsll,300) was included in the estimates for 1935 has been omitted tins year ana for this reason t. balance the budget the expenditure has been reduced accordingly* It is however noticed that the sum of Rs30,000 sanctioned by His Highness for the improvement of Muscat and »atrah scheme of which fe 1606x1 were spent last year has been omitted and though payments on account are being made without any hitch or trouble itis not understood why this amount has been excluded/ IT this is to be added it would be necessary to by the like amount increase the receipt side/in order t® balance the budget for which it would be necessary to refer the matter t© the Director of Revenues who is unfortunately absent now.
