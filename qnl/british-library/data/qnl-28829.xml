Pt. of HALLANIYA ISLAND,one of the KOORIA MOORIA group (Arabian Coast).- A party of us went on shore and, on landing, we were friendly welcomed by five or six Arabs, two adults and 3 or 4 youngsters.- We gave these wretched people two living goats and some bread, then they guided us to their encampment a cou ple of miles inland.- There we saw their wives and the remainder of the children, they were all told eleven inhabitants.- Besides the encampment being as miserable as possibly could be,these people who lived exclusively on fish had not even a boat to go on fishing. Nevertheless they said having been on the island for years.- 6n our way back on board we met close to the landing place three piroques in each of which were two negroes the one hold ing the oars and the other looking for oysters*- Having been questioned through our Arab interpreter these men informed us that they belonged to a buggalow which was cruising in the bay and that recently left the Somali Coast - |Zaila).- Last Wednesday the 8th. instant, we stopped again close to the north shore of Hallaniya Island with the purpose to give the natives some materials to improve their dwellings and bring them some provisions*- I sent on shore the Chiwf Officer and, among the men in or the boat,to who had previously landed with me and knew where the huts laid.- Meanwhile our steam whistle was kept blowing from time to time in order to attract notice.- But notwith standing this and the repeated appeals made on shore by ouroar interpreter ray people met with nobody#- Mpreover having directed themselves to the place where the encampment stood they saw it destructed and close to it they noticed what they took of fresh graves (about ten in number).- Jear one of the huts were remains of fish which seemed to be relatively fresh#- Ag it seems desirable from an humanitary point of view to make out v/hat has become of Hallaniya^ inhabitants and whether their disappearance or death has any connection with the pres ence in these waters of the Somali pearl fishers I have thought it my duty to put before you the above mentioned facts.- Believe me,etc., Sd.- A. de Gerlache Ho. ! b23 ot 1901.- Aden Hesidency.- The I6th.

Maitland, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, To—J. L. Jenkins, Esq., M.A., I.C.S., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to my telegram of the 19th ultimo, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, copy of report by the Officer Commanding the R.I.M.S. Minto regarding the supposed wholesale murder of the inhabitants of the Island of Helaneea. Report on a visit to Uelaneea Island, Kooria Mooria Group. In accordance with instructions contained in your No. 1942, dated the 19th June 1901, the R.I.M.S. Minto visited this island and anchored off the north coast at 9-30 a.m. on the 24th June 1901. Immediately on anchoring the steam syren was sounded in order to attract the attention of any of the supposed inhabitants. A search party, consisting of two ship’s officers, an interpreter of the Aden Political Department and ten men, landed in the ship’s cutter, at a point nearly opposite to the site of the huts marked on the charts of this island, to search for the huts and, if possible, communicate with the inhabitants. A search of two hours, during which time the whole of the available ground was covered, revealed no trace of recent habitation. No trace of fish bones, fires, or the materials for huts, such as might have been expected had the island been recently inhabited, were found. Eleven stone cairns, circular in shape and with an entrance on one side, were found almost on the site of the huts mentioned above. These cairns, which closely resemble the usual type of Mahomedan graves, were examined by the native interpreter, who considered them to be shelters, built for protection against the weather, and he was quite positive that they were not graves. I consider that the inhabitants known to have been on the island during the fine season have probably returned to the mainland for the south-west mon soon period. 1z 7 a, ^4 The shelters Trere probably built by them and their resemblance to Mabo- medan graves must have been the reason for the Captain of the yacht SeliJca making the report that he did. The south-west monsoon was blowing with great force and a high sea was running during the time of our visit, and considering the very barren condition of the island, I should think it very improbable that any one would be able to live there during this season, and fishing would be almost impossible. As vessels would only visit these islands during the fine season, it does not appear to be known if the inhabitants remain there during the south-west monsoon period or not. E.I.M.S. “ MIN TO ^ (Sd.)

True Copy . (Sa) S. P. v a s, Por Postmaster General.1902. No. 1855 of To, The Postiricaster General Bomhay, Dated Muscat 5th April 1902. Sir, The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has desired me to put you in possession of my views regarding the suggested abolition of Indian Inland Postal Rates between Muscat and Gwadur, antong other places. This I have now the honour to do. (.2.) The position of Muscat-cum-Gwadur in reference to this question seems to be a special one not shared either by Bahrein or other ports in the Persian Quit. Prom an international point of view, the Sultan of Muscat is an independent Sovereign in direct relations with Foreign Powers - but he has no Postal Service of his own. His Highness has frequently been pressed by foreign ad venturers, if hot by Roreign Governments, to allow them to inaugurate a Muscat State Postal Service' and increase h ls revenue thereby but owing to his close relations wi „ the British Government he has wisely rejected all advances and the only Post Office in Muscat is entirely under Brifish confrol* This is very convenient politically, and the Sultan and his subjects benefit equally with our own from the pri vilege of paying Indian Inland Rates only. I am sure the Sultan would feel it very much and the Arab public also if these rates were now changed, and it would befdirect incentive to the former to retaliate by instituting a Postal Service of his own, a by no means desirable contingency t st/poh£rlv deprecahe in regard t,o Muscat,H.B.M.'s Consul &amp; P.A MUSCAT. muscat and.

Sir, I have the honour to forward copy of a letter No.185 dated 5th instant on the subject of the existing Postal Rates at Muscat and -Gwadur addressed by me to Postmaster General Bombay, in accordance to the instructions contained in your letter No.36 dated 31st March 1902. I have the honour to be,etc,. / t * Major, H.B.M.'s Consul &amp; P.A.MUSCAT. / jCgirBRITISH CONSULATE, MUSCAT 28th October 1902. &lt;&amp;s My dear Cantine, When we want thc arrest of any Pirate Coast Arab, subject to one of the Chiefs in Treaty with ns, wo always do the necessary through the Sultan. Your note reached me at breakfast, and as Mackirdy was round Just afterwards I had a talk with him about it. Prima facie ' think it is his business to call upon the Sultan to take pro per notice of this matter; if the latter replies officially that he does not feel able to exercise jurisdiction over the -an, then I am ready on hearing from Mackirdy to ask the Sultan to hand thc man over to me. A3 long as the Local Territorial Authority does the necessary, I can hardly intervene; if ho shifts; &gt; xx no exults responsibility, I am ready to act - I hope you understand.
