These are sent by sea mail to India, for onward transmission to Consular and Political Officers in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat; Pondicherry in French India; Kabul, Kandahar, Jalabad [Jalalabad] in Afghanistan; Panjim, Marmagao and Nova Goa in Portuguese India; Kashgar in China; and Katmandu [Kathmandu].The file does not contain the Foreign Office documents included in dispatches, only the covering letters that accompany them on their journey. These are largely from the Under-Secretary of State for India, London, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi, who is asked to confirm safe receipt and onward transmission to the addressees.The file also contains numerous Foreign Office circulars issued to consular officers between 1943 and 1945. These include extracts from Parliamentary debates in 1943 about Foreign Service reform, and reports of Anglo-American discussions in Washington in 1943, by the British delegate and economist John Maynard Keynes, regarding the proposal for an International Monetary Fund.The file includes four dividers, which give a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, Secretary for External Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>International monetary systems</topic></subject><subject><topic>Postwar reconstruction</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomatic service</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>British</topic></subject><subject><topic>Overseas mail</topic></subject><subject><topic>Administrative reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d6#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d6#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d6#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002d6#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
