There is no record of the conversation which is mentioned in Major Watts* telegram No. 34 dated tne £nd 01 March but the Sultans letter under /jl C&lt;JUJ&gt;LoU^-% reference clearly indicates that^/the Sheikh of ^'ujairah is his suoject and presumably the small Sheikhdom as part of his domain. 3. Althcugh at one time undoubtedly part of the Jawasein Sheikhdom of Sharjah I think it will now be difficult to determine whether the Sheikh ol i'ujairah is independent or whether he may still be considered as under the Sheikh of Sharjah or thexJK or the Sheikh of Kalba. However tnat is a matter with which I am not concerned. An examination of the records shows that Fujairah is not ^art of Muscat and further establishes the fact that succeeding Sultans of Muscat have shown a tendency to interfere in Fujairah affairs inspite of various warnings. 4. I suggest that I be authorised to make it clear to the Sultan that Fujairah is not a part of his domain and that the Sheikh cannot be recognised as a Muscat subject. Before making this communication to the Sultan I should lixe to be informed to whom it is considered Fujairah does belong as I should expect the Sultan to ask that question.

VP I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 0082'dated the 9th of June. ^ Jo 1'° 4%^ understand that on receipt of your telegram No. V 0/J5_ dated the 4th March the Sheikh was offered a travel document and refused to accept it. The Sultan made a verbal protest to my predecessor,Major R.P. Watts, objecting to the issue of a separate document and requesting that the passport be visa-ed. This verbal request was followed by the / y ^ written one that formed an enclosure to my letter No. C/77 dated the 1st May. 3. I shall be grateful if I may be informed what reply should be addressed to the Sultan to his request that the passport be visa-ed. The Sheikh of Fujaira is not at present here but I have no doubt the question will be raised as soon as he returns and would like to be in a position to make an immediate reply. 4.

To S7 The Political Agent, Mus ca t« MEMORANDUM SUBJiiCT ; Claim of Sultan of Muscat to Fujaira. Reference correepondence ending with your demi- official letter No. C/11&amp;, dated the 12th June , 1^39, to Huehton, I have diecusaed tnic question «ith Political Agent, Bahrain, since Pujaira is an appanage of the BhaiJch i. of Sharjah or of Has*al«iChaiirah« 2* Briefly, the Sultan has requested you to put a visa for Bahrain on the passport of ths Shaikh of Fujairah, the said passport being a Muscati one. If this visa is given it is tantamount to our acknowledging the Shaikh as under the suzerainty of Muscat. 5* I enclose herewith a copy of a letter No. 821 B ' i ' \ . v_ 12 f ( / n: i of 30th April 1903, from the Government of India to the Political Hesident, from which it will be seen that at that time both these authorities, as well as the Secretary of state for India f were strongly of the opinion that Fujaira should remain under the 'Jowasmi Chiefs', but that they had no desire no interfere authoritativelyin the internal disputes of 'these parts'.Gsnnot therefore countenance tJie suzerainty of ituecat over Jy'ujaira ty giving the visa referred to above. 1 imagine that it was to obtain soioe auoh acknowledgnBnt from ua indirectly that the question of the visa was ar ranged between the sultan and the 3haikh of Fujaira. It is not certain however, that the Shaikh of yujaira does actually realize that by taking out a Muscati passport he puts himself under the Sultan* we are not bound by our treaties witn the 'Jowasmi ChiefB ,, to guarantee their terri- tory, but il the Sultan did take over Pujaira we would doubt less have complaints from either the Shaikh of sharjah or Ras-al-Khaimah, or both, and there would be a good deal of unpleasantne bs and various complications 5. It seems to me that this is a case that we should ■Tj u itt;ep at arms' length for as long as possible# Should the sultan therefore raise it again you should explain that you cannot give a visa on the Shaikh of Fujaira^ passport as that would be an acknowledgment on our part that Pujaira belonged to Muscat* You should proceed to ask the Sultan v.hat the grounds are for his claim to Fujaira, and inform him that you are sending these grounds to me. You should express no opinion on these grounds nor inform him at this stage that it is our opinion that Fujaira does not belong to Muscat, y Y Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 11 OFFICE CO c1r i | Copy to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for information^</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000107_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/290</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000107</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/290</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 14/242 (B Series 8/4) SHAIKH OF FUJAIRAH'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-11T00:17:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (10 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged chronologically from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation system in use is the sequence of numbers appearing in a circle in the top right hand corner of each folio.

The correspondents are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Political Agent, Muscat (Tom Hickinbotham and Ralph Ponsonby Watts) and Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat.The letters discuss how the issuing of such a visa would be tantamount to British acknowledgement that the Shaikh of Fujairah came under the suzerainty of Muscat. In a letter the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf gives a response based on consultation of records from 1903 between the Government of India and the Political Resident. This showed that they were both strongly of the opinion that Fujairah should remain under the "Jowasmi [Qasimi] Chiefs" but that they did not want to "interfere authoritatively" in the internal disputes. The final letter in the file from the Political Resident Persian Gulf to the Political Agent, Muscat, advises a strategy to deal with the issue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Fujairah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000107#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
