PERSIAN GULF Mr. Finch suggested that liability to United Kingdom Tax should date from 15/8/47. Usual limits for exemption in the case of unestablished staff will apply, i.e. 1947/8 permanent posts, salary range not exceeding £500 (excluding bonus ) temporary posts £ 1000 . 1948/9 ary post held by unestablished staff exempt if on a salary scale not reaching £600 (consolidated) Mr. Finch will write to Mr. Hallows regarding the position of each case and Mr. Hallows will furnish the former with family details and past history, etc. Officers employed in the Persian Gulf appear to have received their salaries prior to 15/8/47 free of tax both Jnited Kingdom and Indian and it is the intention to compensate them for their current liability. At first it was the intention to raise their F.S.A. but Mr. Finch pointed out that this allowance was designed to compensate oruy lo r additional expense involved in living abroad and that it would be more correct to increase salaries. He ssjn that the Foreign Office had approached the Treasury with a view to the employing Office paying the tax of the people involved, phis&lt;has the advantage that if taxation decreased the ^ individual would not gain compensation for more than his liability. Mr. Hallows is writing to the Treasury asking for authority to do this in the Persian Gulf cases. He will me; hflve conies of correspondence. (Signed). £.A.

With reference to your letter of the 19th February, we a re of the opinion that 'liability extends ~to employees of this area but some of these individuals will not be chargeable to tax following our practice with regard to unestablished employees serving abroad, on small rates of remuneration. In those circumstances I should be glad if you would let me know what, if any, amount paid to these individuals could properly be regarded as a foreign service allowance. We contemplate taking the matter up with the Treasury, with a view to obtaining a certificate as to the appropriate amount to be excluded from the total remuneration under this head. The probability is that, after the exclusion of the appropriate figure for foreign service allowance, only a few of the higher paid people will remain in the liable |ield. v\ Yours sincerity F.^.K,.
