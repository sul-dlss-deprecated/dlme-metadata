Proposal of His ^ixalted Highness the Hi Sam's Government to inetal electric lights in the Roza (tomb) of the holy prophet at Medina, and also to repair certain tombs there. S&gt;‘Mi I iiave the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with the late Foreign and Political Department Memorandum No.F.38-K/56, dated Xu 9th July 1956, on the above subject and to forward for information and favour of necessary action copies of the marginally cited correspondence.

(4) Letter No.2245, dated 19th September 1938 frora trie F 1 1 i tical Member, H. B.H. the Nizam's Coverrrnent, Hyderabad. 2. On receipt of the memorandum referred to above, its ^airport was communicated to His Exalted Highness the Nizam's Government. Ho reply was received until letter No.465, dated 24th February 1936. On its receipt it was realized that the proposal received from the legal office showed that His Exalted Highness the Nizam, who is personally interested in this question still proposed repairs which appeared to be unlikely to be approved by the Government of Saudi Arabia. The position was therefore explained in greater detail in my Secretary's letter No.1867-1, dated tn© 6th April 1938, and the matter was also discussed verbally with the Political Member who said that he entirely appreciated the difficulties involved and did not think that the proposal for repair of the tombs would be ressed. 33. The letter now received (Ko.2245 dated the 19th beitember 19^6; does not refer to the previous correspondency and might without this explanation appear to suggest xacc that the difficulties involved in these proposals were not fully appreciate by His £xaltea Highness the fciaes^e Government. This is not however the case, as the matter has been fully explained to them; and in the circumstances it is presumed that there will be no objection to the Chief proposed visit. 4. I request therefore that, if there is no objection, His Majest- *8 Minister at Jeddah may kindly be asked to afford such assistance as may be possible and that the proper authority in Cairo may also be apprised of this proposal.Copy of letter No.5U63-1/F.^0/1936, dated the 20th July, 19,56, from the Secretary to tiie Hon’ble the Resident at ryderabad, Deccan, to the Sadr-ul-^ham, Political Department, the Niasam’s Goverment, Hyderab^id, Deccan.

The proposals of Hla Hxalted Highness* Gov rnoent whicn vere ;mde origin/ally in 1936 were not aiquonly to instil electric lights in the ioza but also to repair certain totbs and to construct an enclosure. .ia you are aware, the proposals *ere f orwarded to His Britannic flajcety's Minister at Jeddah, who also had the opportunity of discussing txie inatter with the jaudl Deputy uinlstor for Foreign Affairs and with Nawab ahisan Yar Jung. You were liifamed In Thompson's letter No.5063-?, dated 20th July 1936, that Information vas required on certain points of detail. To this your letter under reply supplies an answer; but I am to express regret that you were not Informed In sufficient detail of certain observations of the British Minister In 1956 which 3ir Juncan Mackenzie thinks should have been brought to your notice. 3 , In the opinion of the British Minister this proposal to instal electric light should be distinguished from the proposal to repair certain holy tombs, regarding whlcn I am to observe as follows, while the Jaudl .Minister jf Foreign Affairs has informed the British Minister that tne offer to install an electric plant is welcomed, no official aamarcne has yet been tuaue by Mm regarding the repairrepair of tlie The l-'lnliitsr coneidered that toe proposal to repair certain tom&amp;e required even greater circuaispection than toe earlier reque it, aa few things connected with toe holy cities have divided Muslim rec.mt opinion so acutely li\/xsxx times as toe attitude of toe .laud! AraO Government in regard to toe totos in queaticai. As you are aware, uiie JateDis intentiomiiy desefcrated ixiany toiabn including those of special importance at Madina in purstLanca of tiielr religious Oaliafs, and this action caused great offence to very large numbers of othwr Muslims, The Jaudi (lovemiTient have made soma concessions to this faeiings; but they have been on a very ILmited seals; and the British Minlstar conaidera tteit it would be moat unwise for His Majesty # s dovarniaant to concern itself witxi a question wnich nas so eminently a religious character in the eyes of the exponents of the rival vie vs. The British Minister therefore uHde careful enquiries unofficially from tne iauai Arab Government, and has been advised that it would definitely be better not to connect this proposal with the electricity question. This was also explained to Nawub Ahsan Yar Jung who told the Minister tnat no nad under stood from the personages whom he had seen that there would be no objection to the very moderate proposals of His Exalted Highness' Government, which were limited to the reconditioning of toe wall enclosing tns cemetery of 11-Bakin and a small adjoining cemetery to the north of It at Medina, as also the wall of il-Maala at Mecca. Nevertheless the British Minister would very much prefer not to raise dfficialiy with the Baud! Arab Government any question concerning the cemeteries. He has indeed suggested that if the electricity scheme were formallyformally approved and NawaS Aiiaan Yar Jun^ sent to carry It out, it mi$it poos to le for him to tike up tne question of repairing tne cemetery ^alis direct, ^iien the electriaal project was well on the way to completion; Put it is far from certain that sanction would oe granted even then. 4. If Hia ^Ixaltod Higimoos* doverniiont wish to proceed witn tiie pro oaal to repair the cemetery walla it would certainly oe better, as suggested, to urop any official proposal to t&amp;U effect, and to leave the matter to be discussed un-officlally by Nawab ahsan Yar Jung at a later stage. And while the Hesident will alwsys be ready to forward Hie iSxaltad Highness 1 Oovemmenti proposals in the matter, ilr Juncan Mackenzie desires me to express his personi! view that this proposal is likely to cause embarrassment both to His uritannic Ajesty^ Minister at Jeddah and to the Government of caudi Arabia who hsve to consider »ahnbi opinion which is atiii so little advanced ae to make this proposal a very delicate natter. 5. Turning to the electricity proposal, the British Minister has invited attention to Article Y of the recent Jaudi-Egyptian Treaty of which a copy ia enclosed. It seems possible that nia dnjesty the King of iaadi Arabia while unwilling to refuse a handsome offer, may not be really enthusiastic over accepting so important and conspicuous an addition to the equipment of the Huram at Medina, more particularly in view of hia obligations to Agypt. This is only a matter of surmise, but dir Duncan ivhekenzie thinks that tne information which he has on the subject aheuid be laid before His waited «. •»«ixalt&lt;Ki Highneaa* Jovem. 11 . 3 nt,, In oraar that they may not niaundsr'tanl It If litar th« .Jaudl-Arab Govarn- rcent appear to ralaa difficult las or causa delay in the u-itter of the electric Installation, hi this connection I nrt to forward for your Lnfomotion a copy of the only official cooaunic&amp;tlon so far received from the jaudl-Arab Govornumt despatcii Ko. 155/2/5 dated the 16th uy, 1936, Uie inn&amp;uaeie of «ilch lends support to this durialse. In vie&gt;* of tills possibility I an to say that while ev^ry assis tance will, as heretofore, be rendered through diplomatic channels toward* tne execution of this generous project, it la thought that the political difficulties involved should be placed clearly before you in case His Exalted Highness' Government desire to reconsider tne proposal. 6. ns explained aoove It is regretted that you were not informed before of the possible oostacles In the way of repairs to tombs and cemeteries, fhis seems to have been due to the impression that Nawab .ahaan Yar Jung, who had had conversations with the aritii-.h Minister an ti»« subject, was sufficiently .au fait, with tne situation to be able fully to Inform the His&amp;m's Government of the difficult lea. Cu a closer reading of tne ;d.ni; r tor 'a letter It seems possible that tiiougit tt»e difficulties were to soiue exteiit explained, tne minister perhaps did not. definitely make the suggestion that the question of repairs to the cemeteries should bo postponed until the electrical project was well under way and should then be approached delicately by the Nawab himself with the local authorities.?

My Lord# With reference to my despatch No.21 of Ifehru^ry 26th# I have the honour to state that about the beginning of March the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me unofficially that a request for permission to enable the Government of Hyderabad to install an electric lighting plant in the Harem at Medina would be favourably entertained. I delayed official action, however, until I could obtain further information regarding the area to be lit. This was provided on March 31st by V&amp;wab Ahsan Yar Jung, the Chief ’Sngineer of the Hyderabad Government, who had corre on pilgrimage and had been in direct communication with high Saudi personages. He explained that the project was to light the whole of the Haram enclosure. My further action was delayed for extran eous reasons but on April 24th I addressed an official note to the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs, a copy of which I enclose. 2. While I was dealing with the electricity question, I received the Foreign Secretary*a despatch No.F.38-N/36 of i March 3rd conveying a further request from the hiiam’s Government Ihnt permission should be obtained on their behalf to repair certain holy tombs at Medina. This seamed to me to require even g^e r tar ciroumepection than the earlier request, es few things connected with the Holy Cities have divided Moslem opinion so acutely in recent times as the attitude of the Saudi Arab Government in regard to the tombs in question. It is strongly held by extreme Wahhabis that the veneration of anything in the nature of a shrine is / idolatrous, Hie Excellency The Viceroy of India, (Foreign 4 Political Department), New Delhi.idolatrous, hence the desecration in the past of so many tombs including those of special importance at Medina, It is equally strongly held by all Shi•as and very large number*of other Moslems that the Wahhabi attitude is wounding to their deepest religious sentiments. The SLaudi Government have recently made some concessions to this feeling but they have been on a veryjlimited scale e.g. they have, I understand, restored the specially venerated tombs at Medina to some semblance of decency• 3, I consider thnt it would be most unwise of this eminently a religious character in the eyes of the exponents of the rival views. On April 28th, however, I sounded Fuad moderate personal view/s. He told me in effect that the Wahhabi opinion which the Saudi Government had to consider was still so little advanced that it would be a very delicate matter to raise the question of a genuine restor tion of tombs. seek permission to recondition the actual tombs. He explained that for iihe time being the Government of His Sxalted Highness JtCv wisned merely to restore taa-t walls enclosing the cemetery at Medina known as til-Bakia and a small adjoining cemetery shown to the north of it in the plan in Mr. Rutter^ 'Holy Cities of Arabia'. They also wished, he said, to restore the wall of the cemetery in Mecca called Rl-Maala. The Mawab had understood from the personages, whom^ he had seen, that there would be no objection to the reconditioning of the walls mentioned above. Nevertheless I Arab Government any question concerning the cemeteries, I suggest Legation to concern itself with a question which has so Bey privately on the subject, knowing to be a man cf He advised me definitely not to connect this with the electricity question. 4 When I saw Nawab Ahsan Yar Jung three days later, I found him very ready to agree that it would be a mistake to should very much prefer not to raise officially vith the Saudimmm suggest that if, as I hope, formal permission is given for the electricity scheme and if the Ifawab is sent here to carry it out, he should be authorised to take up the question of repairing the cemetery vails direct with the Saudi authorities, when the electrical project is well on the vay to completion. 6.

Your Royal Highness, After Compliments, I have the honour to inform your Royal Highness that the Government of His jfxalted Highness the Nizam of Hydera bad have, on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of His Bxalted Highness, expressed a wish to provide electric light in the Haram at Medina at their expense and have requested the Government of India to ascertain whether the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz would be prepared to accept this offer. I had some personal discussion on the subject with His Excellency Pauad Bey Hamza some weeks before he left Jedda and gathered that the Saudi Arab Government would probably be disposed to accede&lt;|[ to the wishes of the Govern ment of Hyderabad, if approached officially on the subject. I understand further thaii an engineer in the service of His Exalted Highness the Nizam, Mr. Ahsan Yar Jung took advantage of his recent visit to this country on pilgrimage to study the practical aspects of the proposal and exchanged views on the subject informally with the competent authorities. I shall be glad to learn whether I may now inform the Government of India officially that the proposal of the Government of Hyderabad meets with the approval of the Saudi Arab Government and that the scheme may be proceeded with on the lines discussed with Mr. Ahsan Yar Jung.

My Lord, With reference to my telegram Mo.31 of May 29th, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of a aoi? from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to mine of April 24th regarding the proposal of the J overnner. c of Hyderabad to provide electric light in the Haram at &gt;v Medina. 2 , Before the enclosed official reply was sent, the Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to rce on the subject on May 6th. He reaffirmed the readiness of his Government to accept gratefully the offer ot tne Government of Hyderabad but said that certain incidental problems had to be considered and referred in particular to the question of consequential expenditure. At first, I thoujUU-that he was speaking of the eventual cost of upkeep of an expensive installation out presently he referred to the cost of transporting the plant to Mx*±«*x Medina, which might cost half its value, as though he were under the impression that the intention of the Government of Hyderabad was simply to deliver plant here and let the Saudi Government do the rest. 3 . I said that I was clear in my mind that the Government of Hyderabad wished not only to provide i but to erect it themselves at Medina and to b^c necessary expenditure until it was completely instal led and 'the light could be switched on'. 1 added that His Sxcellenoy /the The Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla.the question of eventual expenditure on upkeep was certainly not one requiring careful consideration but that I had no information regarding any views of the Government of Hyderabad on this aspect of the matter* 4 , fhe Government of India will observe that in their official note the Saudi Arab Government raise these and two further points* relative to (a) the exact site proposed for the new installation, having refard to the fact that another installation already exists and (b) the Waqf character which they assume will be given to the installation. 5. x presume that, if the scheme materialises, the Hyderabad Government will have no objection to the constitution of a Waqf in regular legal form. As regards the eventual cost of upkeep, the Government of India will doubtless move the Government of His Sxalted Highness to provide material for a reply to the relevant part of the enclosed note* As regards all other points, I suggest that, if an agreement of principle can be reached, it would be best to send JBfawab Ahsan Tar Jung to this country to discuss practical details* 6* It seems to me possible that Ibn Saud, while unwilling to refuse a handsome offer, may not be really enthusiastic over the prospect of being beholden to an Indian Government for so important and conspicuous an addition to the equipment of the Haram at Mwdtan Medina* His attitude may also be somewhat affected by the prospect of ^jyptian assistance in developing the Holy Cities, in accordance with Article V of the recent Saudi-Kgyptian Treaty.

As Your Lordsnip is aware, the Wahabi attitude in regard to shrines has in the past been very Intolerant and, while it has been modified / in recent years, the Saudi Government might still dislike the intervention of a foreign Government in suoh a matter, even if they were otherwise disposed to take advantage of the offer. 2. I had no opportunity until |february 26th. of speaking privately to the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject. iUad Bey's personal reaction was not unfavourable and he referred spontaneously to olher recent benefactions in favour of the tomb.

Long ago after the boys* class was abolished in the ^adraaa tfizamiah, Mecca authorities ordered Maulana Abdul itaql to accept a teacher in his school, appointed by the government, to teach 'Tauhid' ( the Unity of God), but on his representing the matter to the Amir of Medina, the Madrasa Nizamiah was exempted, as no boys received education in that Madrasah, and all the students were grown up men who had completed theological education and were getting poet graduate lectures. The Madrasah was doing its work without inter -ference from the Saudi Government till the begining of this month, when Shiekh~ul-lBlam of Mecca, Shlekh Abdulla bin Hassan came to Medina and ordered Maulana Abdul haql to accept a teacher appointed by the Government, to teach w Tauhid w to the professors and the students of his Madrasa, otherwise the Madrasa will be closed, Maulana Abdul baql considered the order derogatory to his co-workers and his students position t and refused to accept it, and consequently he has been ordered by Abdulla bln Hasan to close hia Madrasa, There are more than thity students in the Madraaa from India, Afghanist€in, Boxnara, Turklstan and other parts of the world, who are recognised Ulemas in their countries, and have come here to take the post graduate diploma from this Madrasa in ' Tafsir * and 'Hadis* 1 , The curriculum of this Madrasa is fixed according to the Hanafi sect of Islam, and has the sane- -tion of the Misam'e Government, The Baud! Government has always professed that it recognised the four Sunni sects, viz. Hanafi, Shafaee, Malaki and Hanbll; but the order of Shaikh Abdulla bin Hasan is an open Interference with ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■Idoctrines and teaching of the Hanafi aeot, and a coapulaion to follow the teachings of the whabiiaa .
