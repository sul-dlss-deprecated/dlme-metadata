A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains papers and correspondence sent between the Political Agency and the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) between 1935 and 1945, relating to civil and criminal court cases in Bahrain. The cases raised include property theft (folios 26-29), disputes over land ownership (folio 59), inheritance (folios 13-19), accidential death (folio 48), and liability for the dangerous condition of roads (folios 33-34).Correspondence between the Political Agent and Belgrave in early 1945 relates to a court case involving an Iranian complainant. The case had proceeded through the Bahrain (domestic) courts for a number of years, on the presumption that the man was a native Bahraini. The Political Agent (Cornelius James Pelly) and Belgrave discuss the implications of the man's revelation that he is Iranian, and whether the case should now be transferred to the Political Agent's court, which has jurisdiction over non-Bahraini subjects (see folios 55-74, and office notes at folios 99-101). The case leads to the republishing of a Government proclamation, stating that no cases may be transferred from the Bahrain Court to the Agency Court on claims of nationality, unless the claim is made at the first hearing (folio 74).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00022f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00022f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
