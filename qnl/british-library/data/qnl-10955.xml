                           Dumas, which carried mail to and from the Persian Gulf. Although a port is not visible, it is likely that the steam ship is at anchor, since there are at least five other, smaller vessels alongside her.A vertical rope and knot are out of focus in the foreground, indicating that the photograph was taken from on board ship, where rigging would be present.Damaged film, printing error or a light leak has caused a band, most discernible in the lower edge of the left of the image, to appear under-exposed in the print.Inscriptions:Lower left, below image, in pen: ‘Karachi.’Upper left, above image, in pencil, crossed-out: ‘a’Lower right, alongside image, in pencil: ‘1’Lower right, below image, in pen: ‘S.S. “Dumas” (Gulf Mail) (Jan. 1917)’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023803156.0x000024#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
