Lear Golonel, As you are probably now arranging the rates to be paid for current used in the private part of your house it may interest you to see what charges were fixed for Bahrain, The Office Allowance was increased by Rs.700/- a year to pay for the running of the plant ana a meter was eventually installed to check the amount of the current supplied to the private part of the house. The P.A had to pay Twelve Annas a unit for all current used by him. I found this charge of Twelve Annas,which I think is very high,siill in force when I came ana had to pay it until we were able to connect it with the Bahrain Government su ply. ^ (r~ I enclose copies of corresponaence in which the points were decided^in case they are of any use to you. it Col.li.R.P.Dickson,C.I.E., Political Agent,Luwait.O ' f K l ^ y f/p) Copy of a memor nuurn No.4251-Est.B., os ted 5th November 1920, from the Secretary to the Government of Indi?: in the Forei ~n and Poll tier!

It is presumed that the share of the expenditure on kerosine and lubric; ing oil for the lights and fans in the non-residential portion of the building will be met from the existing grant for 'Hot and Cold Weather Charges'.

The rate per unit would then nave to be fixed, (it is charged for at -/12/- per unit by l^o Military Works here and is.l/4/- per unit by tne Bushire electric light Coy.), and you would pay accordingly.

I beg to state that owing to technical difficulties on account of the engine being incapable of taking the full load of the installation it has been found impracticable to alloc te the snare which should oe borne Dy tne residential portion of the Agency and it is considered that this can best be effected by tne installation of a meter. The installation bein'; in need of certain adjustments which cannot be carried out locally, it will be necessary to close it down completely for repairs to oe effected in India during the recess of the Political Agent. During this time, arrangements will be made to acquire a meter ana by the time the installation is brought into use the rate per unit which should be charged will be arrived at in consultation with the Executive Engineer, and I will then address you further on the /natter. Copy to the Secretary to tne Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with reference to his No.685 of 1922 and 1166 of 1922. The introduction of a meter seems the most practicable solution and it will be useful in tne event of the establishment of an Electric Power Company wnich it is believed may shortly materialise.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to enquire whether I can enlist your assistance in the following matter. ^• We are anxious to stimulate the trade in slaughter stock between this Territory and Zanzibar. At present we are hampered, to some extent, by the absence of large dhows fitted with decks, suitable for carrying stock without inflicting cruelty, and at the same time afford ing them a firm foothold and adequate head room while in transit. 5. I am credibly informed that dhows of the kind I describe, are engaged in the Persian Gulf trade, and it might be of advantage to the owners of such to cater for this livestock trade. 4« Our local dhows are mostly small coasting vessels entirely unsuited for the transportation of animals in any numbers, as they possess no deck space, and are, therefore, only allowed to carry small Consignments of stock. 5* Is it within your province to ^represent to j^cmr local ov/ners of suitable dhows, the possibilities of this trade? I shall be glad of any advice and recommendations that you can give me, Yours faithfully, S/ d••© • ® • Ag: Director oi Veterinary Service.

We have tried to tap other sources such as Zanzibar and the Sudan but so far not been successful. Y/ould you be kind enough to let me know v/hether there are any English speaking Arabs within your orbit with administrative or high grade clerical experience who would be willing to come to the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and what would be the salary scales which would have to be offered to them. It is of course essential that the men who may be recruited are really ^ good. They should be capable of touring the provinces where they would reside P.T.O. Major T.
