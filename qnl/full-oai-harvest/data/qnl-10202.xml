The Political Agent refers to the competing building schemes of two British companies, the shipping agents Gray, Mackenzie and Company Limited and the Imperial Bank of Iran. The file also contains English translations of an exchange of letters in 1944 between the Political Agent and the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad Al Jabir Al Sabah [Āl Ṣabāḥ, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir], in which the latter agreed to reserve a plot of land for the construction of Agency staff accommodation, and to prevent development of another site already occupied by the Agency’s rain water storage tanks.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Government buildings</topic></subject><subject><topic>Land development</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000170#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000170#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
