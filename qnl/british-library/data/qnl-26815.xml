League into a Moslem League so that Turkey could become a member. The Minister answered that Turkey was organised on a lay basis and that therefore a religious basis for such a league was inappropriate. How, moreover, could the Christian Lebanon be a member of a Moslem League?* A religious basis was in his view in any case inadvisable on wider grounds* on the other liana he thought that a league of all nations of the Middle East on the lines of a regional arrangement such as was contemplated by the Charter of the United Nations, would be useful. 3* Discussion elicited from Monsieur Ayasli that lie was aware that the Egyptian Govern sent might not relish a development of this kind since it might ffear for the leadership of the irab League at present enjoyed by Egypt* He did not, however, appear J to set much store by this point and went on to express the opinion that with the emergence of Pakistan as a large and potentially rich, important Moslem State with a numerous population, Turkey, Egypt and ^Qkistan could provide a balance which would remove the temptation for considerations of jealousy and rivalry* Pakistan would clearly exert a great influence amongst the Middle Eastern countries* I suggested that Turkey, on her part, could hardly fall to have considerable influence, to which Monsieur Ayasli assented in modest terms* 4* I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty^ Ambassadors end . inieters at nkara, Baghdad, Teheran, Beirut, Damascus, Anraun and jedda; I have the honour to be, With the highest respect.

He told me that there had been sosae disaooolntaent in the Palace over the fact that I apparently had not returned with some present in the way of a gesture in iy hands. 4. Monsieur Triantafyllidls also confirmed from his own experience what the agent had told me with regard to an apparent divergence of policy between the Palace ano T okrashl Pasha oft the attitude to be adopted by u ^gy!:&gt;t in respect of Husain. He thought there were distinct signs of a tendency on the part of Nokrashl to make up to ^ u ssia with &amp; view to a possible further reference to United nations Organisation on the Anglo-Egyptian dispute, ana that tnis was contrary to the wishes of King Farouk. He told a ® J of his transactions with the Ministry of Foreign -ffairs and with the Head of the Royal Cabinet on the attitude of the Egyptian delegate to United nations Organisation in respect of various resolutions r nd speeches regarding the presence of the troops of one nation on the territory oi another, which tended strongly to bear out the existence of &amp; olicy between the Palace and the Prime inister. The reek inister* s chief aim. was to secure that nothing should be done to make Impossible the continued presence, at the Invitation of the Sreek Government, of British or American troops, or both, In Greece. r The Turkish Minister, who always shows himself most friendly, asked me, at a casual meeting, about our attitude towards an agreement to evacuate oelng mac e a ^rlo condition of any resumption of negotiations, i what the oosltlon was and he expressed.the view that It could not ( be otherwise. onsleur AyasU also asked whether ills H*J**$r * Government intended to demand a change of Government. 1 sale that what Interested us was that there should be someone with whom an agreement eoeld be reached. How that ^brought a bout was for the Egyptian* to decide; in any case X did not expect to be instructed to make any demand of the kind he had mentioned, vhich he seemed to accept as a matter of course, A. curious statement hc-s been attributed to &lt;onsieur Ayasli in a recent press reoort, the general eiiect of wbicn was that hie country or he would favour the creation of a League of Moslem countries (which Turkey would Join) ss distinct from, and instead of, an Arab league, and that membership of such a Moslem League would not run counter to the obligations of signatories of the Saadebad ^ cu. I nave hod occesion before now to observe what from this post appear to be signs that Turkey Is cautiously and gradually aiming st securing a position of predominant influence, if not os ctive leadership, among the countries of the Middle -.aet; rno „he statement attributed to Monsieur Ayaell seems to oe amore open suen a policy. •’»nat la perhaos of ‘ interest, however.

I shall hone to secure some further light on all this when the Inister calls on me In the near i ture. /ItIt may Indicate a feeling amongst Turks that so long as Egypt is able to arrogate to herself, and Is conceded, ^ the leadership of Arab countries, the organisation of security in the Middle East will be delayed, or even prevented. 7. from ^hat the net Chinese inister tells me, he has been lavish in his advice to prominent Egyptians to abandon their foolishly intransigent attitude and to seek a settlement with us in a constructive spirit of compromise. He tells me that he has impressed on them that the Chinese have always found it possible to reach agreement with the British notwithstanding initial divergencies of view in any given case, and that of all people the British can be counted on to play fair and to be reasonable in negotiation. He has told them that whereas they seem to expect that they must be conceded everything they demand and resent it if this does not happen, international relations by their very nature- mean eoaipromiae and mutual concessio . octor Ho did not claim to have made many converts but apparently Intends to continue his preaching on these lines g. It would seem from the foregoing that we are not lacking in support from members of the local Diplomatic body; and it is of a certain interest to know that these diplomatists, no doubt reflecting the views of their Governments, desire to see the conclusion of an ^nglo- «yptian settlement and do not consider that #11 the right is on the side of the Egyptians. ut whether,failing a considerable change in the temper of the Egyptian Government they will have a very effective influence on events, is another matter. o i have ~ent a cony of this despatch to Hls Ma lesty * s Ambassadors at Washington, Athens, Ankara oxid anking.

J g g ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY NEGOTIATIONS, 1945-47 [The passages side-lined in black are Guard] - EGYPT AND SUDAN March 12, 1947 Section 1 On 20th December, 1945, the Egyptian Government addressed to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom a note requesting the revision “ in the light of recent events and of their experience ’ 5 of the arrangements governing the mutual relations of the two countries. The Egyp tian Government argued that the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty of 1936 was concluded under the pressure of circumstances which had been removed; that it was necessary to bring it into harmony with the new international situation; and that its clauses which “ detract from the independence and dignity of Egypt ’ ’ no longer corresponded to present conditions. In particular, the note argued, “ the presence of foreign forces on our soil in peace-time, even if stationed in distant areas, is still wounding to national dignity ” and “ .... it would be better for the two countries that their relations should be founded on mutual understanding and confidence.” The note terminated by recording that “ the nego tiations will include the question of the Sudan and will be inspired by the interests and aspirations of the Sudanese.” 2. This note was the culmination of a movement which had been gaining in force and momentum since the African continent had ceased to be an active theatre of war, a movement which had become crystallised in the slogan “ evacuation and unity of the Nile Valley.” It had been recognised by His Majesty’s Government that they could not well refuse to consider a revision of the treaty, notwithstanding that its Article 16 made no provision for such revision, even with the consent of both parties, before December 1946; and that, failing the agree ment of both parties, the treaty had a further ten years to run before revision could be claimed by one signatory alone. Apart from other considerations, it might be argued that a number of articles of the 1936 treaty were out of date and others, such as those referring to the League of Nations, no longer applicable in their present form. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government had been in no hurry to embark on negotiations affecting 86-10 so vital a strategic area as Egypt since, up to the month of August, hostilities had continued against Japan, and the effects on imperial strategy of war experience and the atom bomb still required intensive study. Accordingly, when the Egyptian note materialised, His Majesty’s Government returned, on 26th January, an acceptance which, however, reaffirmed the basic soundness, as proved by the course ol the war, of the fundamental principles of the 1936 treaty. The reply described the policy of His Majesty’s Government as being to consolidate, in a spirit of frank ness and cordiality, the close co-operation achieved by Egypt and the British Com monwealth and Empire during the war, and to place it on a footing of full and free partnership as between equals in the defence of their mutual interests, and with full respect for the independence and sovereignty of Egypt. But whereas the Egyptian Government had suggested that an Egyptian Delegation should undertake negotiations in London, His Majesty’s Government replied that “ instructions will shortly be sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Cairo to hold preliminary conversations with the Egyptian Govern ment.” In fact the prevailing excitement in Egypt, and the probable divergences of view between the two parties, would cer tainly have wrecked full-dress negotiations in London conducted, as they would have been, in a glare of publicity. 3. From the standpoint of the political situation in Egypt, the omens were by no means wholly favourable. The Government in power on 26th January was the combina tion (Saadist. Liberal, Kotla and Inde pendent with Palace support) which had taken office under Ahmed Maher Pasha when the King dismissed Nahas Pasha in October 1944. Maher Pasha’s assassina tion had led to Nokrashi Pasha’s appoint ment to the Premiership and, in contrast to his predecessor and former leader, he was naturally of a rigid, suspicious and aloof mentality which, in spite of his real desire for the conclusion of the Anglo- Fgyptian treaty, made it difficult to discuss2 I with him and prepare the way for the achievement of this object. The Wafd, who had boycotted the elections which followed their dismissal, were in uncom promising opposition, and the conditions were reproduced in which negotiations had been undertaken, and successfully concluded in London, by a non-Wafdist Prime Minister in 1929, only to be wrecked by Wafdist sniping and subse quent intrigue in Egypt itself. In these circumstances His Majesty's Govern ment had to ask themselves whether they should negotiate with the Government in power, or insist on the formation of a national government such as came into being spontaneously and conducted the suc cessful negotiations for the treaty of 1936. His Majesty’s Government decided that to intervene in the sense indicated would be in direct contradiction to their avowed policy of respecting Egypt’s independence. They did, however, suggest to King Farouk, in the strictest confidence, that his present team were perhaps not the strongest available, and that he would do well, having regard to historical precedent, to consider seriously whether he should not endeavour, by bringing about a government on a wider basis or at least by securing the participation of the Wafd in the Egyptian Delegation, to safeguard Egypt from a debacle similar to that of 1929. But it was made very clear that this was a problem for His Majesty to settle without British assistance. 4. The basic objectives of His Majesty’s Government in the prospective negotiations were as follows : — {a) To give effect if possible to the com bined military and political advice w r hich they had received that the ideal method of safeguarding the essential interests of the Middle East and the British Commonwealth was to aim at a general 'partnership between the Middle East States and the United Kingdom for the purpose of mutual defence; and that the re vised Egyptian treaty—an essential stone in this edifice—^should be so conceived as to dovetail into a regional partnership of that kind. Granted that any treaty so nego tiated would have to conform in all respects to the Charter of the United Nations, it was in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, open to pairs, or groups, of States to con clude special defence arrangements in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter, pending the entry into force of an all-round system of inte^ national security. His Majesty’s Government contemplated that, if their views on these points obtained acceptance, the security arrange ments embodied in the revised treaty settlement with Egypt should be communicated to the States Arab League (together with th^^Tu be set on foot by His Majesty’s Government in Palestine and else where in the area) with a view to their endorsement by the League and the ultimate formation of a military confederacy between His Majesty’s Government and the countries of the Middle East embracing as wide an area as might be required; the continuation of the Anglo- Egyptian alliance in accordance with the principles in articles 4-7 of the 1936 treaty and notably of the aid promised by Egypt in case of war or emergency (article 7). The text of these articles is as follows :— Article 4 An alliance is established between the high contracting parties with a view to consolidating their friend ship, their cordial understanding and their good relations. Article 5 Each of the high contracting parties undertakes not to adopt in relation to foreign countries an atti tude which is inconsistent with the alliance, nor to conclude political treaties inconsistent with the pro visions of the present treaty. Article 6 Should any dispute with a third State produce a situation which in volves a risk of a rupture with that State, the high contracting parties will consult each other with a view to the settlement of the said dispute by peaceful means, in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of any other international obligations which may be applicable to the case. Article 7 Should, notwithstanding the pro visions of article 6 above, either of the high contracting parties become engaged in war, the other high con tracting party will, subject alwaysto the provisions of article 10 below, immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally. The aid of His Majesty the King of Egypt in the event of war, imminent menace of war or appre hended international emergency will consist in furnishing to His Majesty The King and Emperor on Egyptian territory, in accordance with the Egyptian system of adminstration and legislation, all the facilities and assistance in his power, including the use of his ports, aerodromes and means of communication. It will accordingly be for the Egyptian Government to take all the adminis trative and legislative measures, including the establishment of martial law and an effective censor ship, necessary to render these facilities and assistance effective. To render Egyptian aid effective, and to ensure that His Majesty’s Government had the facilities neces sary to.render their own aid effective, His Majesty’s Government required a British base in Egypt manned by such British military formations and personnel as were necessary to provide the nucleus of a war estab lishment and to ensure continuous collaboration in training and the provision of equipment. These formations would necessarily in clude fighter squadrons for defence against long-range bombing. Egypt’s acceptance of the foregoing arrangements would constitute a part of her contribution—the rest being represented by the participa tion of her own armed forces in the defence of the Middle East. Differ ently expressed in the light of subsequent developments, objective (b) covered (i) the maintenance of adequate defensive arrangements on Egyptian territory in peace-time and (ii) the right of British forces of all arms to return to Egypt to reinforce the existing nucleus in war or emergency. Under the 1936 treaty the presence of British forces in the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt had been provided for, up to a strength of 10,000 troops and 400 Royal Air Force pilots, by article 8 and its annex. (c) So far as the Sudan was concerned, His Majesty’s Government’s view 86-10 was that any revision of the 1936 arrangements should be postponed until the Sudanese people had been consulted and had made known their wishes. His Majesty’s Government regarded any prior discussion of the question of Egyptian sovereignty over the Sudan as academic when viewed in the light of the rapid growth of an indigenous Sudanese nationalism and of modern inter national doctrine as embodied in the United Nations Charter. 5. Although His Majesty’s Govern ment's reply to the Egyptian Note was delivered on 26th January, nearly two months were to elapse before serious dis cussions were opened. In the first place, after one extremely general conversation with the King on the treaty issue. Lord Killearn left Egypt on appointment as British Commissioner for South East Asia. Secondly, a serious outbreak of student agitation took place early in February. These manifestations were suppressed with energy by Nokrashi Pasha who thereby, however, antagonised both his Master, who seems to have shrunk from such severity, and also the more extreme advocates of “ evacuation.” Nokrashi was shortly after wards dismissed, and replaced by the veteran statesman Ismail Sidky Pasha, who brought to his task a reputation for extreme competence in negotiation and action and a ruthlessness towards disorder greater than that of Nokrashi. On the other hand Sidky Pasha suffered from a grave lack of solid parliamentary support. And Sidky was, for the time being, to belie his reputation as the terror of the students. Further disorders took place, and were excused (if indeed they were not actually inspired) by the Pasha. A particularly serious outbreak took place in Cairo on 21st February and in Alexandria, where four British military policemen were killed by the mob, on 4th March. It was out of the question for negotiations to be opened by the new Ambassador, Sir Ronald Campbell, until at least tranquility had been restored, and discussions could take place uninfluenced by cruder Egyptian forms of political pressure. 6. Sir Ronald Campbell arrived in Egypt on 20th March. On 7th March the Egyptian Government had appointed a large treaty delegation composed of a number of elder statesmen including four b 24 ex-Prime Ministers. The Foreign Office had viewed the creation of this body with misgivings (which the future most abun dantly justified) since in the absence of a “ united front.’’ such as had existed in 1936, the delegation was a collection of individuals with their own political axes to grind, and their own political futures to serve. Sir R. Campbell was instructed (since the delegation, despite its numbers, of course contained no Wafdist) to ask the Egyptian Government for an assurance that the delegation was sufficiently repre sentative to warrant the assumption that a treaty negotiated with them had a reasonable chance of being implemented. The request was put both to the King and to Sidky Pasha, and the reply was affirma tive. 7. His Majesty’s Government had decided that negotiations on their side could conveniently be conducted by the Ambassador assisted by the Service Com manders in Egypt and by the senior members of his staff. This, however, was too modest an array for the Egyptians who, pointing to their row of dignitaries and ex-Prime-Ministers, insisted that their amour 'pro'pre demanded an answering gesture from the British side—and indeed that Sir R. Campbell might feel isolated in the presence of sudh overwhelming Egyptian numbers. His Majesty’s Govern ment were ready to meet Egypt’s wishes, and appointed the Foreign Secretary to lead the British Delegation assisted by Viscount Stansgate, then Secretary of State for Air, and His Majesty’s Ambassa dor, the delegation being advised by Sir K. Cornwallis, Sir A. Overton, the Service Commanders and Major-General Jacob, then serving in the Chiefs of Staff Secre tariat, It was decided that the Secretary of State should not proceed to Egypt, at any rate at the outset, but that Lord Stansgate should conduct the negotiations on his behalf. Lord Stansgate and his party arrived in Egypt on 15th April. 8. Before this had happened, however, the first phase of the negotiations, which may be termed the private and exploratory, had opened between Sir R. Campbell and the King and Sidky Pasha, and was des tined to last until 30th April. It had’been borne in upon Sir R. Campbell on arrival and from subsequent representations deliv ered by Sidky Pasha on the psychological factors present in Egypt, that there was no statesman or party in Egypt who would be prepared to subscribe to the presence of British forces in Egypt in peace-time, whether in the Canal Zone or anywhere else, and that an attempt by Majesty’s Government to insist on the realisation of their full objectives as set forth above would produce anti-British disturbances on a major scale. It moreover emerged that Sidky Pasha was not ready to adopt the proposed regional app roac h (see paragraph 3 (a)) and this concej^Jfhi henceforth dropped out of the discussions, except for a half-hearted effort by the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs on a later occasion to revive it, and for its canvassing by Lord Altrincham in the House of Lords when opportunity offered. The Ambassador’s telegrams to this effect were accordingly discussed with the dele gation and the Chiefs of Staff and revised instructions were issued to Sir R. Campbell on 16th April. These instructions were finally communicated to Sidky Pasha on 19th April, after a preliminary conversa tion on 18th April, in the form of an aide memoire, reproduced in Annex 1 to this memorandum. The main points were :— (1) The evacuation of all British com batant troops by stages, with the exception of fighter squadrons (though in the last resort the delega tion was authorised to accept the withdrawal of such squadrons as from the time when the Egyptian air force was in a position to pro vide a peace-time garrison, it being understood that our own squadrons could be free to return in emer- gency). (2) The maintenance by Egypt, with British collaboration, of naval, land and air administrative defence organisations. (3) Permission for the transit of troops and aircraft and the maintenance of a transit organisation. (4) The creation of a regional head quarters in the Canal Zone. (5) The provision of equipment for the Egyptian forces. 9. Both the King and Sidky made it clear from the outset that proposals on the above lines stood no chance of acceptance. On 22nd April Sidky Pasha communicated to Lord Stansgate the opinion of the Egyptian military authorities on the pro posals in the aide-memoire, together with a note embodying his own conclusions. These documents constituted a complete rejection of His Majesty's Government’s proposals. Accordingly, on 22nd April, Lord Stansgate reported that “ we have exhausted the possibilities of progress in preliminary talks with the King and Sidky5 .?asha and can no longer avoid coming into the open at official meetings with the Egyptian delegation. ...” “It is quite clear that the Egyptian delegation would reject His Majesty’s Government’s pro posals and demand complete evacuation. There are no arguments which we can en^oy in support of our proposals which carry any weight with the Egyptian dele gation in comparison with the fears which press on them on every side.” The King and Sidky Pasha ‘ ‘ know that they have no chance whatever of representing our proposals to their delegation and to their people as compatible with Egyptian inde pendence and sovereignty. Complete evacuation of Cairo and Alexandria means little to them as we are already committed to that under the 1936 treaty, which they consider we have so far shown no sign whatever of fulfilling. The removal from Egypt of combatant troops means little because it simply involves the substitution of a considerable number of British administrative troops and some fighter squadrons for the 10,000 men and 400 pilots permitted in the 1936 treaty. The whole of our proposal appears to them to be an elaborate attempt in a new guise to perpetuate our hold on the country.” A full exposition of the Egyptian viewpoint as expressed at this stage is given in Sidky Pasha’s note of 21st April, which is repro duced as annex 2. 10. The alternatives facing His Majesty’s Government at this juncture were thus to go forward to formal negotia tions on the basis of the proposals rejected by Sidky and his military advisers, or to offer the complete evacuation of all British troops from Egypt and negotiate the best possible peace-time defence arrangement on that basis. As against (a) it was urged by the delegation that we should either have to give way in negotiation, or carry through our proposals by force and face an appeal to U.N.O. The result (apart from what U.N.O. might do) would be loss of Egyptian friendship and co-operation, strained relations with the Arab countries, and an unrivalled opportunity for Russia to fish in the resultant troubled waters. As against (b) it was admitted that the strategic implications of complete evacua tion were serious and that “ the assistance we should be able to give to Egypt in peace time would be limited to collaboration between staffs and to the maintenance by the Egyptians of administrative installa tions with the assistance of British techni cal personnel in mufti.” But, on the other hand, it was argued that “ we should retain Egyptian friendship and co-opera-1 tion in full measure.” The delegation’s! conclusion was that the alternative of com plete evacuation should be adopted and that they should be empowered to make a public announcement to that effect at the opening of negotiations, adding that negotiations would take place with the Egyptian Delegation with the object of arranging details of the withdrawal and of making satisfactory arrangements for mutual assistance in emergency in accord ance with the spirit of the alliance, which it was the settled policy of His Majesty’s Government to consolidate as between equal nations with interests in common. 11. The Cabinet accepted the delega tion’s advice and Lord Stansgate was so informed on 25th April with the reserva tion that “it is physically impossible for us to complete the total evacuation in less than five years.” The Cabinet agreed that it would be helpful if, at the appropriate stage, a public announcement could be made, with the concurrence of the Egyptian Government, making it clear that the latter accepted our estimate of the minimum time necessary for withdrawal. His Majesty’s Government also hoped that it might be possible to secure arrangements for something in the nature of an Anglo- Egyptian Joint Defence Board to work out arrangements for giving effect to the new treaty. 12. Accordingly, on 30th April Lord Stansgate handed to Sidky Pasha a memo randum dated 29th April containing the proposals which the British Delegation would table at the first joint meeting of the two delegations. This document, after recapitulating the policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Egypt as already des cribed, and the strategic aspect of the relationship of the two countries, proposed that under the new treaty the maintenance in peace-time of the organisations, facili ties, installations, &amp;c., which were of such importance to their security should become the responsibility of the Egyptian Govern ment, and that all British naval, land and air forces should be completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory. “In order that Great Britain may assist Egypt in carry ing out this responsibility, His Majesty’s Government propose that arrangements for close consultation between the two Govern ments and their military staffs should be worked out, and that such technical assistance as may be necessary should be provided by Great Britain to Egypt on a basis to be mutually agreed.” The docu ment went on to justify the estimate of6 five years as the time required to liquidate the immense war organisation set up on Egyptian territory. Sidky Pasha accepted the offer of withdrawal with, in the delega tion's words, “ restrained gratification,” but expressed concern over the five-year period, which he professed to regard as altogether excessive. 13. On 7th May, as a result of further exchanges of views between the Secretary of State and the delegation, Lord Stansgate issued the following statement in Cairo :— “It is the considered policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to consolidate their alliance with Egypt as one between two equal nations having interests in common. In pursuance of this policy negotiations have begun in an atmosphere of cordi ality and goodwill. The Government of the United Kingdom have proposed the withdrawal of all British naval, military and air forces from Egyptian territory, and to settle in negotiation the stages and date of completion of this with drawal, and the arrangements to be made by the Egyptian Government to make possible mutual assistance in time of war or imminent threat of war in accordance with the alliance.” 14. The first formal meeting of the British and Egyptian delegations took place on 9th May, when the atmosphere was £ ‘ cordial but reserved. ’ ’ It was agreed that the next meeting should take place when the Egyptian delegation had studied the documents communicated to them. It was also agreed that British and Egyptian experts should carry out an inspection of British service installations in Egypt. 15. On 19th May the first exchange of treaty texts took place between Sidky Pasha and the legal adviser of the Foreign Office, who had been sent to Cairo to reinforce the British delegation. The Egyptian text was described by Lord Stansgate as “ a childish effort so limited in scope as to be quite hopeless from our point of view ’ ’ and as an effort to decide the whole question of the Sudan in favour of Egypt in advance. Neither this draft nor the first British draft which, Sidky Pasha prophesied, would 1 ( make a bad impression on the Egyptian Delegation need be reproduced here, except to mention that the British draft laid down in detail, as the 1936 treaty had done, the facilities to be provided by Egypt to render fully effective the mutual assistance to be afforded by the parties in war, menace of war or apprehended international emer gency. It was also reinforced by a draft military convention communicated a days later. From a preliminary study of the two drafts, however, Sidky Pasha evolved a personal document which may be taken as a point of departure and was described by him as an “ avant-projet conjoint ad referendum des deux cotes. This document is reproduced in translid^tm as Annex 3. It will be noticed that it alters the title of the instrument under negotiation from treaty of alliance to “ treaty of mutual assistance.” 16. The British draft and accompanying military convention were rejected by the Egyptian Delegation, who “ were not willing to include either in a treaty or in a military convention any provisions corresponding to article 7 of the 1936 treaty (even in the revised, more palatable and reciprocal form in which we had dressed them up when presenting our draft of the military convention) nor any provision about our maintenance of installations and stores of equipment of the kind which we had prepared They offered no hope of anything extensive beyond the avant-projet ” (see preceding paragraph). Lord Stansgate accordingly announced that, as it was quite outside any of his instructions to sign a treaty without a provision of this kind, the only thing he could do was to send a report on the position to His Majesty’s Government. In the event Lord Stansgate was recalled for consultation and arrived in England on 3rd June. 17. It was recorded in paragraph 11 above that the Cabinet had expressed the hope that it might be possible to secure arrangements for the establishment of an Anglo-Egyptian Defence Board to work out arrangements for giving effect to the treaty. This suggestion had at first been rejected by the Egyptian negotiators owing to a complete misunderstanding on their part of the intended nature and functions of the board, but the idea appealed to King Farouk, who mentioned it spontaneously to Lord Stansgate and Sir R. Campbell as providing a possible way out of the existing deadlock, quoting the United States-Canadian Joint Defence Board established during the war as an analogy which would repay examination. A care ful study of the composition and functions of this board was accordingly initiated. 18. Article 16 of the treaty of 1936 provided that “ any revision of this treaty will provide for the continuation of the alliance between the high contracting parties in accordance with the principles contained in articles 4, 5, 6 wnd 7.” Having regard to the refusal of the7 ^gyptiim negotiators to reproduce the substance of article 7 of the 1936 treaty in the revised treaty, and to the existence of a deadlock in the negotiations, the Law Officers of the Crown were asked on 1st June to advise (1) to what extent, in the absence of agreement, His Majesty’s G-?»*ernment were entitled to rely on articles 6. 7 and 8 of the treaty of 1936 as being valid and in force, (2) to what extent His Majesty’s Government could rely on the sentence in article 16 quoted above as constituting an obligation on the Egyptian Government to conclude in a new treaty provisions containing the principles of those articles. The Law Officers’ reply was in substance (1) that if the Egyptian Government declined to accept the proposal of His Majesty’s Government as to new provisions for warlike assistance, the present negotiations would fail and the existing treaty including articles 7 and 8 would remain in force; (2) that, on the other hand, there was no obligation on the Egyptian Government to agree to the conclusion of a revised treaty containing any particular provisions. And, as regards article 7 of the 1936 treaty, the Law Officers concluded their opinion with the statement that, ‘ ‘ although the treaty may be kept on foot by His Majesty’s Government refusing to conclude a revised treaty save on such terms as to warlike assistance as may be agreeable to them, the existing pro visions of article 7 in that regard are likely to be of little value in the event of Egypt not wishing, when any emergency arose, to implement the spirit of the treaty.” 19. As a result of consideration in the light of the above, fresh proposals were approved by the Cabinet and telegraphed to Sir R. Campbell on 9th June. The following is an extract from Foreign Office telegram No. 1137 of 9th June :— “ . . . . in actual practice the imple mentation of any defence scheme maintained in peace-time on Egyptian territory and by Egyptian personnel depends on the goodwill of the Egyptian Government and the Egyptian people and the effectiveness of our joint lay-out, and that this holds good whatever provisions may, or may not, figure in our treaty arrangements, published or unpublished. Thus, even if the provisions of the 1936 treaty were textually reproduced in the new treaty, an unfriendly Egyptian Government could, in an emergency, sabotage them without great difficulty. For instance, even under the 1936 treaty, His Majesty’s Government were not the sole judges of the existence of an emergency. There was to be consultation as provided for in the agreed minute which forms part of the treaty. It would be open, therefore, to a hostile Egyptian Government to refuse to admit that an emergency had come into existence. Contrariwise, a friendly Government might give us (as in 1940-44) far more extensive facilities than were ever defined in writing. In any event it is useless to have facilities for the re-entry of troops if there are no adequate facilities available for them, and, although the treaty of 1936 did not explicitly provide for this, they did in fact exist, and this was clearly recognised by the parties. From a practical point of view the maintenance of installations, &amp;c., is more important than a treaty right of re-entry after con sultation. The only method by which we can secure the maintenance of these installations is through arrangements between the two military staffs and undertakings in some form to carry them out by both Governments. “ This being so, I have endeavoured to re-adapt certain provisions of Sidky Pasha’s avant pro jet so as to replace, in a manner acceptable to Egyptian opinion the (in Egyptian eyes) inadmis sible provisions of the 1936 treaty.” 20. The readaptation of Sidky's draft (Annex 3) consisted in the introduction of a new article 4 embodying the idea of a Joint Defence Board, and the revision of Sidky Pasha's articles 4 and 5. The following are the full texts :— “Article 4.—It shall be the common task of the high contracting parties to ensure their mutual security, defend their territories and protect their com munications. In order to ensure the mutual co operation and assistance of the high contracting parties and the contribution which each will make to the common task His Majesty The King of Great Britain and His Majesty the King of Egypt agree to establish a joint Board of Defence composed of the competent military authorities of the high con tracting parties assisted by such other representatives as the two Governments shall appoint. The functions of the board shall be :— (1) To co-ordinate measures for their mutual defence in the region of the Middle East, including territories adjacent to Egypt. (2) To study the land, sea and air problems, including personnel8 and material connected there with, and to prepare plans for consideration of the high con tracting parties. (3) To ensure the protection of their overseas communications, and the defence of their communi cations within the coastal and canal zones. The board shall meet as required for the carrying out of these specific func tions and in order to keep under review the international situation and to consult with a view to advising and recom mending appropriate action to the two Governments upon all events which may threaten the security of either of them, in particular the security of the Middle East including all territories adjacent to Egypt. Article 5.—The high contracting parties agree that subject always to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, their respective armed forces shall, in the event of war involving either of them and endangering their security in the Middle East including all terri tories adjacent to Egypt the necessary measures in close co-operation with each other, for the purpose of mutual assistance. As soon as the Security Council of the United Nations has directed action to be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security, the measures taken by the armed forces of the high contracting parties shall be co-ordinated with the action of the Security Council. Article 6.—It is agreed that the manner in which the high contracting parties shall render assistance to each other, and in particular the technical conditions of the co-operation referred to in the preceding article and the steps which should be taken to enable the armed forces of the two high contracting parties to be in a position effectively to resist aggression, including the main tenance of the necessary facilities, are matters to be settled by arrangements made between the competent military authorities of the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Egypt.' 21. It was intended to complete the arrangements by means of an evacuation protocol providing for the withdrawal of British troops and installations by stages, and for the co-ordination of the evacuation with the plans for the future to be drawn up by the British and Egyptian military staffs. Meanwhile the Egyptians had intimated that they wished the question c^* the Sudan to be treated in a separate protocol and, although the proposals com municated to Sir R. Campbell covered that question, it is being treated separately in a later section of this paper. On 15th June Sir R. Campbell was authorised to put the foregoing proposals to S^Aky Pasha and enquire whether His Majesty’s Government would be justified in request ing the Secretary of State for Air to return to Cairo to continue the discussions on that basis. As a result of soundings in Cairo and further exchanges of telegrams with London, it was announced in the House of Commons on 3rd July, in reply to a question, that negotiations were being resumed. The Egyptian Delegation had in fact found the Cabinet’s proposals “ not far removed from their own ideas,' subject to further discussion which, Sidky urged, should not be restricted to “ minor drafting modifications ’ ’ in view of the effects on the delegation of anything in the shape of an “ultimatum.” Lord Stansgate arrived back in Egypt on 7th July. 22. On 6th July Sir R. Campbell was informed that the Defence Committee had agreed to the complete evacuation of the Nile Delta by 31st March, 1947, subject to full facilities for the operation being provided by the Egyptian authorities. 23. The succeeding phase of the negotia tion lasted until 26th September and (apart from the Sudan) was almost exclusively concerned with that section of the treaty which defined in what warlike circumstances the parties should “ con sult ’ ’ and in what circumstances they should “act,” by action being meant the automatic implementation of plans which would already have been drawn up in time of peace, and would, of course, provide for the entry into Egypt of British forces of all arms. On 8th July the Egyp tian negotiators produced a counter-draft of the treaty which is reproduced, as amended after oral discussion with Sidky Pasha, as Annex 4 and which finally determined the order of the articles. Article 2 of this draft was a modification of the last British article 5 and of article 4 of the Sidky avant-pro]et; the original article 2 disappeared (being in fact covered by the preamble); the British article 4 became, in a revised form, article 3 setting up the Joint Defence Board; and the British article 6 disappeared, being covered by the Egyptian article 3. In the (meantime work had been proceeding in London on the draft of an evacuation protocol, which is reproduced as Annex 5, and was presented to the Egyptians.9 86-10 c 24. It would be unprofitable to record in full the various suggestions and counter suggestions put forward for the drafting of artide 2. These suggestions were con ditioned, on the British side, by the prac tical knowledge that, to be effective, measures against an aggressor must be tirf^^y and swift, and by the determination not to subscribe to a guarantee such as that given to Poland in 1939 when His Majesty’s Government accepted the obliga tion of guaranteeing Poland without possessing the necessary political and military facilities for implementing it. The Egyptian side were less concerned with the prospects of future aggression against themselves or against the Middle East than with a pre-disposition to see in every proposal put forward by His Majesty’s Government a device either for involving Egypt in a war in which she would have no interest, or for placing His Majesty’s Government once more in a position to reoccupy Egypt and interfere in Egyptian internal affairs. It was these fears which caused the Egyptians to press the necessity of prior ‘ ‘ consultation ’ and to reject any form of words involving a British right of re-entry into Egypt as a result of an emergency involving any but the countries immediately bordering on Egypt. The Egyptians, furthermore, were unwilling that any text should in terms provide for their being assisted by the United Kingdom when attacked, and not for the United Kingdom’s being assisted by Egypt in a similar predicament. The other point of dispute was the period of the total evacuation of Egypt which His Majesty’s Government continued to insist must be five years, and which the Egyptians insisted must be very consider ably less. A vigorous effort was made in mid-August by the Egyptian Ambassador in London, who visited Cairo for the pur pose, to force an agreement, with King Farouk’s support, on a compromise text furnished by His Majesty’s Government which provided for “ action in the event of Egypt or the countries adjacent to Egypt being the object of armed aggres sion; and for consultation with a view to action in the event of a threat to the security of any of the neighlxmring countries of Egypt. But the royal initiative, after an apparently promising start, petered out; and on 20th August the Egyptian Delegation announced that ‘ ‘ the texts and explanations which they have received from the British side are not of a nature to make them modify their attitude. Consequently, they declare that they abide by their note of 1st August, 1946,” a document which recorded the delega tion’s opposition to the standpoint of the British Delegation on article 2 of the draft treaty and the evacuation programme. At the same time an official communique made it clear that the negotiators “ consider that the field remains open for further exchanges of view with the object of reaching a favourable issue in the interests of both countries.” Nevertheless on 24th August Amr Pasha submitted fresh proposals allegedly worked out with, and accepted by, the recalcitrants in the Egyptian Delegation, and considerable activity and lobbying continued behind the scenes. A pause was then imposed by the reconstruction by Sidky Pasha of his Cabinet so as to include in it representa tives of the Saadist Party, which had hitherto stood aloof. King Farouk, for his part, departed on a Mediterranean cruise, from which he only returned in the second week in September. 25. Discussions were resumed between the two delegations on 17th September on the basis of a slightly amended British version of article 2 which, to meet Egyptian insistence on “mutuality,” pro vided for ‘ ‘ action ’ ’ also in the event of Great Britain becoming involved in war in the territories adjacent to Egypt. On 26th September the Egyptian Delegation finally agreed the text of a note again rejecting the British proposals. It had been intended to present this note at a joint meeting of the delegations, but before this could be done an early and stronger version of the document appeared in the press. Sidky Pasha thereupon in formed Lord Stansgate that he deplored this publicity, that he was highly indig nant at the conduct of the delegation, that he saw no reason why Lord Stansgate should not (as had been proposed in such an event) proceed to London for consulta tion, and, finally, that he had resigned the Premiership. In the event King Farouk insisted that Sidky Pasha should remain in office. Lord Stansgate, accompanied by Sir R. Campbell, arrived back in London on 3rd October. 26. It may be convenient to recapitulate at this stage the measure of agreement and disagreement reached on the basis of the Egyptian text of 8th July (Annex 4). Preamble .—Agreed save for drafting suggestions. Article 1.—Agreed. Article 2.—In dispute. Article 3.—Agreed save for possible drafting amendments. Article 4.—Agreed.Article 5.—His Majesty’s Govern- c ment had suggested the addition of the d phrase ‘ ‘ or any security agreement con- v. eluded by either of the high contracting parties under article 43 of the Charter.” Article 6.—His Majesty’s Govern ment’s proposal was that differences should “ be referred to the Interna tional Court of Justice unless both high contracting parties agreed on another mode of settlement.” This proposal was based on the considerations (a) that this conformed to His Majesty’s Govern ment’s policy in other treaties, (b) that the Egyptian draft provided for nothing that was not in the Charter itself, and (c) that the Egyptian draft failed to indicate which of the means of settle ment foreseen in the Charter would be employed, and, therefore, would not help when the dispute arose. Moreover, dis putes relating to the interpretation or application of a treaty are essentially legal disputes such as are mentioned in the statute of the court itself, and, there fore, suitable for settlement by the court. Article 7.—Agreed. Evacuation Protocol.—In dispute. 27. Further unsettled points were (1) the safeguarding of transit rights for British R.A.F. aircraft after the evacuation of Egypt had been completed, and (2) the continuation, after the disappearance of the 1936 treaty, of the financial obligations contracted under that treaty by the Egyptian Government. 28. Before dealing with the next phase of the negotiations, it will be convenient to bring the narrative up to date as regards the Sudan. The Sudan 29. In the 1936 treaty the question of the Sudan is dealt with in Article 11 and an annex, and four paragraphs of the “agreed minute” attached to the treaty. The article provides that the administra tion of the Sudan shall continue to be that resulting from the condominium agree ments of 1899, and that “ the Governor- General shall continue to exercise on the joint behalf of the high contracting parties the powers conferred upon him by the said agreements,” i.e., supreme civil and mili tary authority. It provides that the primary aim of this Administration shall be the welfare of the Sudanese, and expressly reserves the question of sove reignty over the Sudan. Paragraph 2 provides that appointments and prorn^^ tions of officials remain vested in the Governor-General, who, “ in making new appointments to posts for which qualified Sudanese are not available, will select suitable candidates of British and Egyptian nationality.’ Paragraph 3 pro vides that in addition to Sudanese 1^'P S “ both British and Egyptian troops shall be placed at the disposal of the Governor- General for the defence of the Sudan. The remaining paragraphs deal with immigration and non-discrimination be tween British and Egyptians in the Sudan, and the annex with the method of apply ing international conventions to the Sudan. The agreed minute deals with the manner of the re-entry of Egyptian troops into the Sudan and by implication affirms the right of the Governor-General to limit the num ber of these troops. Generally speaking, the 1936 treaty readmitted the Egyptian army to the Sudan, whence it had been banished since 1924, and opened the door to a measure of readmission of Egyptian officials. On the other hand, it referred explicitly, for the first time, to the Administration’s primary task of pro moting the welfare of the Sudanese. 30. The outstanding new factor in the situation in 1946 was the emergence of a politically conscious class in the Sudan, consisting of two main factions, one of which favoured association with Egypt and the other independence after a brief period of further education under British auspices. Both these factions sent “ dele gations ” to Cairo when the negotiations got under way. On 26th March, 1946. the Foreign Secretary, in reply to a question in the House of Commons, made the following statement:— “ Yes, Sir. His Majesty’s Government look forward to the day when the Sudanese will be able finally to decide their political future for themselves. It is not proposed by His Majesty’s Government to influence their eventual decision in any way. His Majesty’s Government have no object in the Sudan other than the true welfare of the Sudanese, and this principle has likewise been proclaimed by the Egyptian Government in the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The welfare of the Sudanese cannot be secured unless a stable and disinterested administration is maintained in the Sudan. The objects of such an administration must be to establish organs of self-government as a first step towards eventual independence,c 2 86-10 11 ''Mo accelerate the process of appointing Sudanese to higher Government posts in consultation with Sudanese representa tives, and to raise the capacity of the mass of the people for effective citizen ship. These are the objects of the present Sudan Government, and His Majesty’s Government fully support t.,em. In the meantime, His Majesty’s Government consider that no change should be made in the status of the Sudan as a result of treaty revision until the Sudanese have been consulted through constitutional channels.” This announcement was followed by a speech of the Governor-General to the Advisory Council. To this speech great exception was taken by the Egyptians, who argued that while the Convention of 1899 gave the Governor-General unfettered administrative control, he was not em powered to announce policy, save by direc tion of, and in agreement with, both High Contracting Parties. 31. Having regard to the inevitable difficulty of shelving the Sudan issue again, the British negotiators had decided that, as a constructive suggestion, they should propose the appointment of a joint Anglo- Egyptian Commission (possibly with a neutral chairman or several neutral mem bers) to visit the Sudan and make recom mendations for the future of the territory in accordance with the principles {a) that the primary object of the Sudan Adminis tration was the preparation of the Sudanese for self-government, and (b) that when this objective had been reached the Sudanese should be free to decide their relationship with the contracting parties. A draft article in that sense was agreed which, for the rest, was silent on the sovereignty question and reaffirmed the agreements of 1899. Steps were also taken to revise the annex, which had proved extremely cumbersome in practice. 32. The Egyptian negotiators early ex pressed the view that the Sudan should be dealt with in a separate protocol and discussed after agreement had been reached on other matters. Their first draft, which, as remarked in paragraph 21 above, decided the whole issue in their favour in advance, ran as follows :— “ The high contracting parties under take to enter into negotiations immedi ately in order to determine the status of the Sudan within the framework of the interests of the Sudanese peoples on the basis of the unity of the Nile Valley under the Egyptian Crown.*' 33. The first British draft, submitted to Sidky Pasha on 20th June, was in the following terms:— Protocol The high contracting parties are agreed that the primary object of their administration of the Sudan is the welfare of the Sudanese and the pre paration of the Sudanese for self-govern ment, and that, so soon as this latter objective is attained, the Sudanese peoples shall be free to decide their future relationship with the high con tracting parties. The high contracting parties intend to appoint a Joint Com mission for the purpose of making recommendations for the future of the Sudan in accordance with this principle and in full consultation with the Sudanese peoples. Pending the conclusion of a further agreement between the high contracting parties as a result of the recommenda tions of the Joint Commission, article 11 of the treaty of 1936, with its annex, and paragraphs 14 to 17 of the agreed minutes accompanying the said treaty shall, notwithstanding article 1 of the present treaty, remain provisionally in force. 34. Sidky Pasha declined to comment on this text, and the matter remained in sus pense until the end of July, when Sidky and his Foreign Minister insisted that there could be no doubt about the sove reignty of the Egyptian Crown over the Sudan and that this was not a matter on which the Sudanese could be consulted. Sidky made it clear, moreover, that, while he agreed to the idea of a Commission, such a body would have to base its investigations on the unity of the Nile Valley under Egyptian sovereignty. The Egyptian Delegation, in their note of 1st August, claimed “all rights without exception' in the Sudan and in fact argued that the Sudan should be part of the Egyptian administrative system and that the Sudanese had no right to take exception to such a status. 35. The following extract from Foreign Office telegram No. 43 to Alexandria gives the instructions issued to the British Dele gation at this juncture :— ‘ ‘ The question of sovereignty in rela tion to the Sudan is legal and theoretical. Differences of opinion on questions of sovereignty in unusual cases do not usually turn on the actual position of the territory in question, but on what the12 criteria of sovereignty are. Though sovereignty is an every-day term in international law, international lawyers seldom agree exactly on the definition of sovereignty itself. In particular there is a School A which regards the sovereign as being the owner of the ultimate title as opposed to the owner of the immediate rights of administration and a School B which holds that the sovereign is the person internationally responsible at the moment. Thus in the case of a leased territory, some lawyers hold that the sovereign is the lessor, and others that he is the lessee; yet there is no difference as to the actual position of the leased terri tory. In the case of the Sudan, School B holds that the sovereignty is divided because the administration is divided. On the view of School A the position is more complicated and depends on— “ {a) Whether Egypt ever lost sove reignty over the Sudan before 1890; and “ (b) If so, whether the re-conquest is to be regarded as an operation to re-establish Egyptian sove reignty or to establish a new position of joint sovereignty. “ In the treaty under negotiation, the United Kingdom are not concerned in theoretical questions, and refuse to commit themselves to any statement in the treaty about sovereignty over the Sudan which would inevitably be mis understood and create more political difficulties than it would solve. “ Consequently they are not prepared to do more than in 1936, viz., to say that nothing in the new treaty prejudices the question of sovereignty; a formula which, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, neither admits nor denies Egyptian sovereignty and enables the Egyptians if they so desire to say outside the treaty that they consider themselves the sovereigns. “ Our task is to deal with practical matters, viz., what should be put in the treaty about the future of the Sudan, a matter of practical interest to the Sudan as well as to the United Kingdom and Egypt. We stand by our policy that the governing factors must be-— (a) the interests of the Sudanese, and (b) the wishes of the Sudanese, and are proposing machinery for ascer taining what are the wishes, and perhaps also the interests, of the Sudanese, with a view of forming a basis on which the interests of the Sudanese shall ultimate]^ be decided.” 36. In the course of the endeavours of the King and the Egyptian Ambassador in London to force a settlement in August, the idea was strongly canvassed of dealing with the Sudan outside the treaty by nmans of notes in which each party would r *rd his own point of view on the sovereignty issue, and actual discussion would be post poned until after signature had taken place. This idea was finally rejected by the Egyptian Delegation, who insisted on the recognition of Egyptian sovereignty in the treaty itself. In the course of these discussions emphasis was laid on the necessity of safeguarding Egypt’s perman ent interests such as her dependence on the river Nile. It had become evident by this time that the Sudan was likely to be the most crucial of all the questions in dispute, and that the sovereignty issue could not be avoided altogether. Accord ingly, after further deliberation, a fresh draft was communicated to the British Delegation early in September for presen tation to the Egyptians, in the following terms:— (Sudan) Protocol (1) The high contracting parties agree that their primary policy in the Sudan shall continue to be the welfare of the Sudanese and the active preparation of the Sudanese for self-government. (2) As soon as this latter objective is attained, the Sudanese people shall be free to decide their future. It is understood that if the Sudanese should decide in favour of indepen dence, suitable agreements shall be made between Egypt and the Sudan with regard to the development and utilisation of the waters of the Nile for the greatest benefit of the Egyptian and Sudanese peoples and with regard to the other material interests of Egypt in the Nile Valley. (3) Meanwhile the administration of the Sudan shall continue to be exercised in accordance with the condominium agreements of 1899 and article 11 of the Treaty of 1936. (4) The Egyptian Government declare that the preceding provisions of this Protocol do not prejudice the claim of His Majesty the King of Egypt to be the Sovereign of the Sudan. The Government of the United13 Kingdom, while pointing out that it will be for the Sudanese people to decide upon their future in accord ance with paragraph (2) above and declining to make any pronounce ment on the question of sovereignty, declare that nothing in the preced- ^ ing Protocol prejudices that ques- ^ tion. (5) The high contracting parties shall from time to time secure reports from the Governor-General on the progress of the Sudanese people towards the goal of self-government. At a suitable time they will appoint a joint commission to report on the question whether the Sudanese are prepared for full self-government and in a position to decide on the future of the Sudan and if so, to recommend suitable arrangements for ascertaining what are the wishes of the Sudanese people and for giving effect thereto. 37. This text was rejected by the Egyp tian Delegation, who insisted that the Egyptian Government must take an effective part in “elaborating the demo cratic regime towards which the Sudan should be moving.” Further, “Egyptian sovereignty does not need to be claimed. It exists: it has never been possible to contest it.” The London Conversations 38. The position at the beginning of October as recorded in the foregoing para graphs was thus that a deadlock had been reached on article 2, on the programme of evacuation, and on the Sudan. 39. On 3rd October Sidky Pasha sent for His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and con veyed to him a message, of which the essen tial passage was as follows :— The treaty negotiations now suspended had reached too advanced a stage for it to be possible to abandon the projected treaty. On article 2 and on evacuation agreement could be reached in a quarter of an hour’s conversation round a table. Only on the Sudan was there really disagreement, and it would be a tragedy if negotiations were to founder on a British failure to accede to Egypt’s demand for recognition of what was nothing more than a symbol of Egyp tian sovereignty. Egypt did not expect a share in the administration. For these reasons Sidky Pasha was ready to go to London with the leaders of the two parties which supported the present regime, Nokrashi Pasha and Heikal Pasha, in a firm endeavour to reach agreement on the outstanding question of the Sudan and to conclude a treaty. As a result of further correspondence it was established that Sidky Pasha would not come with full powers to sign a treaty, but that any resulting proposals would have to go to the Egyptian treaty delegation, which was still in being, to the King, the Cabinet and the Egyptian Parliament. It was under stood by Sidky, at the same time, that the Foreign Secretary would remain equally uncommitted by any resulting proposals, and that the object of the visit would be to have a frank explanation of the points of view of both sides from which Sidky “ hoped much.” On this basis the Foreign Secretary agreed to place himself at Sidky Pasha’s disposal between 16th October and 26th October. 40. At the last moment the party leaders, Nokrashi Pasha and Heikal Pasha, decided not to accompany Sidky Pasha, who brought with him his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ibrahim Abdel Hadi Pasha, and some personal staff, to whom were added two journalists. 41. Five meetings were held between the Foreign Secretary and Sidky Pasha between 18th October and 25th October; and four meetings were also held between the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs and officials of both sides. As a result agreement was reached, on a personal basis, on the texts of a treaty of mutual assistance, an evacuation protocol and a Sudan protocol, while certain under standings were also embodied in a so-called “confidential record of conversation con cerning the evacuation protocol.” A statement that “ it was agreed that the attached documents have only been pre pared (id referendum but that if they are put forward officially and unaltered by the Egyptian Government Mr. Bevin will recommend them to His Majesty’s Govern ment ” was initialled on 25th October by Sidky and Abdel Hadi Pashas on the Egyptian side, and by the Foreign Secre tary, Lord Stansgate and Sir R. Campbell on the British side. The “confidential record ” was not included in the initialled documents. 42. Before Sidky’s arrival, considera tion had been given to the possibility of meeting Egyptian objections to article 2 as drafted by the British side (paragraph 24) by exploring a tentative Egyptian sugges tion that the second half of the British draft, viz., that dealing with threats to neighbouring countries, should be trans ferred to article 3. The Egyptian thesis14 had in fact been that article 2 dealt with the initiation of active measures which would already have been agreed by the Governments on the basis of recommenda tions of the Joint Defence Board, and that any consultation specifically mentioned in this article would be the purest formality. On the other hand, the Egyptians had refused to be committed to ‘ ‘ measures so far as the ‘ ‘ neighbouring ’ ’ countries were concerned. They insisted that any threat to such a country {e.g., Iraq) must first be the subject of consultation, and since article 3 was specifically designed to cover questions of consultation, it was in article 3 that the relevant provisions should appear. On this basis agreement was reached with Sidky Pasha in the forms shown in the final version of the treaty reproduced at Annex 6. So far as the rest of article 3 is concerned, Sidky Pasha insisted on the addition to the second para graph of the phrase k ‘ The (Joint Defence) Board is an advisory body.' Similarly, in the third paragraph, Sidky insisted on its being provided that the board’s examina tion of the &lt;£ military repercussions of the international situation ’ ’ should take place “ on the invitation of, and on the informa tion supplied by, the two Governments (see Annex 6). As regards the minor points of difference on articles 5 and 6 (see paragraph 26), it was agreed to omit the suggested reference to article 43 of the Charter from article 5. The Egyptians stoutly maintained their wording of article 6, but finally agreed to a reference to the International Court in the form of a reference to the declarations made by both sides under article 36 (2) of the statute of the court. 43. So far as evacuation was concerned, the Foreign Secretary represented very strongly the contradiction between Egyp tian professions of friendship and the excessive speed with which Egyptians wished to rid their territory of British troops. Acceptance of the Egyptian esti mate that one or two years was a sufficient period for evacuation would either mean that British troops would have to go all the way back to the United Kingdom before going to their new stations, or else would have to go to stations which had not been adequately fitted out for them and where they would suffer great discomfort. Sidky Pasha emphasised the strength of Egyp tian national sentiment on this point, but finally agreed that evacuation should be completed by 1st September, 1949, or earlier if possible. 44. Much preparatory work had also been done, before Sidky Pasha’s arrival, on the question of the Sudan. In the stat^* ment to the House of Commons quoted in paragraph 30 above, the Foreign Secretary had stated that the view of His Majesty’s Government was that no change should be made in the status of the Sudan as a result of treaty revision until the Sudanese had been consulted through constitu^pal channels. Any concession to the E &amp; yp- tians on the sovereignty question had there fore to be scrutinised in the light of this pledge. High legal authority, however, declared that, in fact, the Egyptian monarch had been sovereign of the Sudan throughout the period of the Anglo-Egyp- tian condominium, though the agreement establishing the condominium had created rights for the United Kingdom in the shape of the nomination of the Governor- General and, in practice, virtual control of the administration. No breach of the pledge would therefore be involved in admitting, in a Sudan protocol, that a union existed between the Sudan and Egypt in the shape of a common Crown. As will be clear from the foregoing, and as was emphasised by Sidky Pasha both before and after his arrival, no formula was acceptable to Egypt which did not recognise the existence of this union. On the other hand, the Egyptian Government, it was repeatedly stated, did not claim any share in the administration of the country- On this basis the first tentative drafts of a new Sudan protocol were evolved. 45. The crucial point in the discussions on the Sudan was the insistence of the Foreign Secretary that when they werq ready for self-government the Sudanese should be free to choose their future status and, if they so desired it, choose inde pendence. Having regard to subsequent developments, the following extract from the minutes of the second meeting on 19th October is reproduced in ea)tenso :— The Secretary of State insisted that the situation should be made perfectly clear. He asked Sidky Pasha to say if the Sudanese were being given a chance to be free or if the Egyptians were seek ing a lasting settlement of sovereignty. It must be quite clear that the Sudanese were free to renounce the sovereignty of Egypt if they so wished. Great Britain had held a position in the Sudan which she was being asked to surrender, and before she did so he must be perfectly clear on this particular point. Sidky Pasha replied that nothing in the Sudan would be changed vis-a-vis England. On the question of sovereignty he felt it was impossible to speak now.15 f f •No one knew what developments would be taking place over the next half- ; century, and he felt that the question j which Mr. Bevin had asked him was a matter for our children to decide. ; Furthermore, the United Nations Organisation was discussing all these yfags and seeking their solution. There ^s a forward movement of ideas and in his opinion it was not possible to look so : far ahead. The Secretary of State asked for pro vision for these difficulties to be made ! now and said he sought to avoid handi capping our children when the time came to seek a solution to this problem. He said frankly he must have an assurance that a situation was not created where the Sudanese could never be independent. He pointed out to Sidky Pasha that the Egyptians had sought to embody in a protocol between two Powers the future 1 of a third party to which Great Britain and Egypt would feel committed in the ' future. He repeated that the position must not be brought about in which the Sudan, struggling for independence, would for ever be under Egypt. He wanted to make it quite clear to the British people that nothing was being done to prejudice the right of self- determination. Sidky Pasha replied that if the Sudanese reached a certain point of development they would surely become independent. Nothing on paper could prejudice the right of independence nor could it bind a people in search of liberty. It was a universal principle and not a matter for incorporation m a treaty. He went on to say that as the proposed treaty was based on the United Nations Charter, which affirms inde pendence of nations, he felt it was unnecessary in any new agreement to repeat what had already been specified T in the United Nations Charter. It was clear, however, from SkK} Pasha’s statements that he was in sharp disagreement with the Secretary o State. An exchange of letters was sug gested at this point, but not proceeded with. 46 In the course of further discussion (third meeting) the Foreign Secretary tabled a proposal which, though not adopted, should be placed on record, viz., that the preparation of the Sudanese for self-government should be supervised by a joint council, composed of independent persons of high standing, which would study, at intervals, the development of the Sudanese and report to the two Govern ments. Agreement was finally reached at the fourth meeting on 24th October on the text of the protocol as reproduced in Annex 6. In addition, Sidky and Aodel Hadi Pashas gave categorical oral assur ances that the protocol would in no way afiect British military dispositions in the Sudan. Sidky Pasha also confirmed, in reply to a question, that the admission of unity between the Sudan and Egypt under the Egyptian Crown left the status of the Sudan as it was, but made clear a situation hitherto undefined. 47. Discussion on the evacuation protocol took place on a greatly shortened version of the original British diaft (Annex 5.) The settlement of the final date of evacuation (see paragraph 43) left only some minor points outstanding, and these were cleared up without undue diffi culty. The final version appears in Annex 6. The confidential recoi d mentioned above (which is reproduced in full in Annex 6) covered the grant of all facilities by Egypt to enable the with drawal of the British forces to be carried out expeditiously; the maintenance beyond the dates specified in the evacuation pro tocol of certain wireless stations, the dis posal of installations and stores, and financial arrangements arising therefrom; rights of transit and flight over Egypt of the British forces; and financial rights and liabilities accrued under the 1936 treaty. Sidky’s Disclosures and Subsequent Break- down , n 48. Sidky and his party left London lor Eo-ypt on 26th October. Scarcely, however, was his Excellency airborne than reports started to appear in the Egyptian press about the Sudan, and on 27th October the Observer reported that Sidky Pasha him self had told the press that he had suc ceeded “ in bringing the Sudan to Egypt and that “ it has definitely been decided to achieve unity between Egypt and the Sudan under tffie Egyptian Crown. These reports made no mention whatever of the administration of the Sudan, of its future status, or of the right of the Sudanese to choose their future. The result, inevitably, was a private notice question in the House of Commons which was answered as follows by the Prime Minister (in the Foreign Secretary’s absence in the Lnited States) on 28th October “ x must emphasise in the first place that the exchanges of views which have taken place in London between my right16 4 honourable friend the Foreign Secretary and the Egyptian Prime Minister were conversations on a personal and explora tory basis and not negotiations. They were conducted on the understanding that they did not commit either Govern ment, and that they were to be treated as confidential. I can only regret, there fore, that incomplete reports from Egypt should have appeared in the press. These reports deal only with isolated aspects of the talks, without reference to the whole range of the other matters dealt with in the conversations. In view of what I have said as to the nature of the conversations, I am sure that honourable members will not wish to press for further details at this moment. “Mr. Oliver Lyttleton: Will the Prime Minister give the House further information about the statement which has appeared regarding the Sudan? “ The Prime Minister: My right hon. friend may rest assured that, while the scope of the conversations included the relationship of Great Britain and Egypt to the Sudan, no change in the existing status and administration of the Sudan is contemplated and no impairment of the right of the Sudanese people to ulti mately to decide their own future. “Mr. Lyttleton: May I take it, then, that the statements attributed to the Egyptian Prime Minister are incorrect ? “The Pnme Minister: They seem to be partial and misleading in so far as they seem to announce agreements. Of course, these are purely preliminary con versations, and therefore there is nothing finally negotiated; I think in that respect my right hon. friend is correct.” About this time Lord Stansgate ceased to participate actively in the negotiations. 49. The partial and one-sided character of Sidky’s disclosures immediately created a situation of high political tension in the Sudan, where demonstrations and counter- demonstrations took place, and where the headquarters of the pro-Egyptian (Ashigga) Party and of the Graduates’ Congress were broken up by an organised body of supporters of the independence movement. The newspaper controlled by the latter became extremely intemperate, and called for a holy war against British and Egyptians alike. Personal attacks on King Farouk also appeared, and the journal was suspended for a fortnight. Peaceful demonstrations occurred in pro vincial centres. At the Governor-General's instance the two religious leaders, Sayed Abdel Rahman el Mahdi, the recognised leader also of the independence group, and Sayed Ali Mirghani, who is identified with the pro-Egyptian faction, issued appeals for order and restraint. On 3rd Nove^Ser the Governor-General reported that the prospects of securing willing Sudanese acceptance of the London protocol ” had been almost totally impaired by premature leakages in Egypt, by Sidky Pasha’s emphasis upon sovereignty and failure to mention the balancing concessions by Egypt to the Sudan, and by the use, as a transla tion of sovereignty, of the Arabic word “ Seyada,” meaning to the Sudanese “mastery” or “domination.” In these circumstances “ the co- operation of officials and local government authorities with the Government is bound to be greatly preju diced.” As a result, Sir H. Huddleston sought, and obtained, permission to proceed to London to explain the situation fully to His Majesty’s Government. At the Governor-General’s request an extra British battalion was sent to Khartoum (from Palestine) by air. 50. In the course of his visit to London (where he arrived on 9th November) the Governor-General emphasised the proba bility of force being required to maintain public order in the Sudan if the protocol were put into force, with the resultant destruction of the faith of the Sudanese in the good intentions of His Majesty’s Government. He felt bound to record that, if the Cabinet approved the protocol, he could no longer be in agreement with the sovereignty clause; but was, nevertheless, if His Majesty’s Government so desired, ready to continue as Governor-General and to carry out the protocol, believing that his personal influence might reduce the amount of force required. His Majesty’s Govern ment decided that they had no alternative but to go forward on the course they had taken, and Sir H. Huddleston was accord ingly requested to return to Khartoum and carry on until the future was clearer. At the same time the Prime Minister addressed to his Excellency a letter, which he was authorised to show at his discretion to selected Sudanese leaders, in the following terms :— ‘ ‘ In the course of your visit you have informed His Majesty’s Government of the great anxiety aroused amongst large sections of the Sudanese people by the recent statements in the Egyptian press regarding the conversations in London17 ^between Sidky Pasha and the Foreign Secretary on the subject of the Sudan. You emphasised in particular the fears that had been expressed by the Sudanese that the recognition by His Majesty’s Government of the existence of a union between the Sudan and Egypt repre- e^Nted by a common crown would prejudice their advance towards self- government and the right, conceded to them by His Majesty’s Government, to be consulted before any change was made in the status of the Sudan as a result of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. ‘ ‘ In reply I expressed to you my regret that the Sudanese should have been misled by partial disclosures; and I gave you an assurance which you are authorised to convey to the leaders of the Sudanese people that His Majesty’s Government are for their part deter mined that nothing shall be permitted to deflect the Sudan Government, whose constitution and powers remain un altered by the recent conversations, from the task to which that Government had applied themselves, viz., the preparation of the Sudanese for self-government and for the task of choosing freely what their future status is to be. The Sudan Protocol in fact provides that the Sudanese people shall, when they are ripe for self-government, be free to choose the future status of the Sudan. His Majesty’s Government consider that, in the words used by the Egyptian Prime Minister to the British Foreign Secre tary, nothing in the proposed treaty can prejudice the right of the Sudanese to achieve their independence nor bind a people in search of liberty. The Egyptian Prime Minister pointed out to the British Foreign Secretary that this was a universal principle and therefore not a matter for incorporation in a treaty. “ His Majesty’s Government are glad to learn that you intend immediately on your return to hold consultations with representative Sudanese regarding their closer association with the Administra tion, and to submit the resulting recom mendations to the condominium Govern ments. Meanwhile, the present system of administration will continue; your authority will be in no way impaired; and the agreements of 1899 and article 11 of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 remain in force. “ The object of the recent Anglo- Egyptian negotiations has been to con clude a treaty acceptable to both parties and to reaffirm Anglo-Egyptian friend ship. The Sudanese can only benefit from harmonious relations between the British and Egyptian Governments; their interests can only suffer as a result of disagreement and strained relations between those Governments.” A letter was also sent to Sir H. Huddleston by the Foreign Secretary explaining, for the guidance of the British officials of the Sudan Government, the exact meaning of the Sudan protocol and making it clear that no change in the existing status of the Sudan would result from its signature. 51. Meanwhile, in Cairo, the disclosures regarding the Sudan protocol continued to multiply, and culminated in an article published on 12th November by one of the journalists who had accompanied Sidky to London. The author alleged, inter alia, that “ Egypt has become directly respon sible for the Sudanese administration,” and maintained, in flat contradiction to His Majesty’s Government's thesis, that “ this recognition of sovereignty implies a change in the governmental regime of the Sudan.” It was accordingly decided that it would be necessary to exchange letters with Sidky, at the time of signing the treaty, confirming the oral understandings arrived at in London, and a preliminary warning (based on the press article above- mentioned) was given to the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs for Sidky Pasha on 16th November. Shortly after wards His Majesty’s Government obtained knowledge of the text of the explanatory note on the London conversations drafted by Sidky Pasha for use with the Egyptian Delegation. This note argued conclusively that the protocol did not give the Sudan the right to secede from Egyptian sovereignty. Accordingly, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Cairo, who had been provided with a list of the points on which His Majesty’s Government regarded agreed interpretations as essential, com municated these points orally to Sidky Pasha (who was indisposed), through the Secretary-General of the Egyptian Delegation on 20th November, stressing more particularly the point that the Sudanese should have, when the time came, the right to choose freely their future status, including the choice of indepen dence if they desired it. This message resulted in Sidki instructing the Egyptian Ambassador in London to take up the whole 86-10 D18 matter with the Foreign Offiqe. It was evident from Amr Pasha’s remarks that we were confronted with a major com plication, and in a telegram to the Secre tary of State in New York the Foreign Office uttered the warning that “if we insist on the exchange of letters .... including the secession point .... we shall risk losing the treaty altogether.” Meanwhile, in Cairo, the newspapers had published textually that part of Sidky’s note to the delegation (see above) which dealt with the Sudan protocol, and the whole text of the note appeared in the press on 24th November. On 16th November, in defiance of the understanding between Sidlky and the Foreign Secretary, the Bevin-Sidky drafts were published in Cairo in extenso. The protests of His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires were met with regrets and excuses to the effect that an antidote had to be found to the ‘ ‘ continu ous and poisonous misrepresentation of the Opposition.” On the same date the Egyptian Treaty Delegation met to discuss the treaty documents and adjourned after three and a half hours discussion in the course of which, it was reported, strong- opposition to the proposals had developed. On 23rd November His Majesty’s Charge d’ Affaires reported that Sidky had con tinued to register interpretations of the Sudan protocol contrary to those of His Majesty’s Government, and that when taxed he had insisted that he was “ trying to calm public excitement.” 52. On 23rd November Sir O. Sargent informed the Egyptian Ambassador that it would be necessary to have the oral understandings reached in London on the interpretation of certain aspects of the draft treaty and protocols embodied in an exchange of letters to be signed at the time of signature of the treaty and attached thereto. The ambassador was given a list of the points which were as follows :— (i) That the protocol did not change the status of the Sudan. (ii) That the Sudanese, when ripe for self-government, should have a com pletely free choice of status, includ ing independence. (iii) That the United Kingdom could secure the defence of the Sudan with whatever troops and facilities they required. (iv) That His Majesty’s Forces would retain their present rights of tran sit and flight over Egypt during the period of evacuation, and that the question would then be discussed between the two Governments with a view to arriving at a mutu^ agreement for the future. (v) That the abrogation of the 1936 Treaty did not affect the position of either party as regards financial rights and obligations accrued under the 1936 Treaty. The Ambassador expressed the liv^est concern and said that insistence on Sidky s committing these interpretations to papei would wreck the chances of a treaty. 53. A further obstacle to an exchange of letters was revealed when it was learned that the texts of the treaty and protocols had been communicated to the Egyptian Chamber of Deputies for discussion at a secret session on 26th November which, it was intended, would authorise signature and the over-riding of the Treaty Delega tion. This secret debate, however, would not of itself constitute ratification, and a further debate would be necessary for that purpose. At the secret session Sidky would have to say that there were no treaty documents other than those communicated to the Chamber. Consequently, it would be difficult for the Government to admit, in the subsequent ratification debate, that a further document had later been signed. In these circumstances the Foreign Office suggested that His Majesty’s Government should perhaps content themselves with agreed statements to be made during the respective ratification debates by the spokesmen of both sides. 54. On 26th November seven members of the Egyptian Treaty Delegation published, in the Egyptian press, a statement over their signatures announcing, with reasons, their rejection of the Bevin-Sidky pro posals. By so doing they gave the signal for their dismissal, and on the same day they were formally dissolved by Royal Decree on the ground that their existence no longer had any object. 55. At the secret session of the Chamber of Deputies on 26th November the Govern ment were duly given a vote of confidence. No interpretations of the treaty docu ments were volunteered by Sidky Pasha : he did, however, state that there were no documents other than the three texts under discussion. 56. On 1st December the Egyptian Ambassador delivered an official note stating that on his return to Cairo, Sidky had secured his Cabinet’s approval of the draft treaty and of the Sudan and evacua tion protocols; that by a decree dated 26th November the decree constituting the official Egyption delegation had been abro gated; that the Egyptian Chamber of19 jJeputies, meeting in camer'a on 26th November, had considered the results of the London negotiations and granted the Government a vote of confidence; and that the Egyptian Government were therefore in a position to sign the treaty with its two annexes. It is now necessary to resume the narrative of events affecting the budan which was broken off at the end of para graph 50. While in London Sn H- Huddleston had recommended that Sayed Abdel Rahman el Mahdi, the leader of the Independence groups, should be permitted to come to London to state his case (a proposal which had earlier been made b} the Sayed and discouraged by His Majesty’s Government). This recommenda tion was approved, and it was in addition made clear that if the leaders of the other influential Sudanese parties wished to lay their views before His Majesty’s Govern ment they would be welcome to do so. In the event none were received. The follow ing is extracted from the official Sudan Monthly Record for October-November 1946 :— “ On 26th November Sayed Sir Abdel Rahman el Mahdi Pasha left Khartoum, i with one companion and his doctor, by air for London on his own initiative to explain to the British Government his views on the rumoured Sudan clauses of the proposed treaty. The Sayed s journey was not undertaken at the instance of the Sudan Government. Sayed Ali El Mirghani later made it clear that he did not intend to visit the United Kingdom. On the eve of his departure Sayed Abdel Rahman visited Sayed Sir Ali El Mirghani Pasha for the first time for many years, a courtesy greatly appreciated by the followers of both leaders. Sayed Sir Abdel Rahman on his departure also issued a message to all Sudanese, regardless of sect or party, stating that he intended to set before both Condominium Governments the twin aims of termination of the Condominium rule and recognition of Sudenese sovereignty and the setting up of a transitional Sudanese Government to pave the way for a free democratic Government at the earliest possible The Sayed called for unity, prudence and caution in the critical period through which the country was passing.” 58. The Sayed saw the Prime Minister on 27th November and Lord Stansgate on 29th November. He was received by the Minister of State on 5th December and on 19th December. He also paid a courtesy call on the Foreign Secretary, who had just returned from the United States, on 21st December, the eve of his departure. The substance of the assurances given to the Sayed by the Prime Minister, and subse quently repeated, was that the draft pro toeol made no difference to the present status of the Sudan or its administration; that nothing in it could prejudice the right of the Sudanese people to achieve their complete independence; and that the existence of a union between the Sudan and Egypt created by a common Crown did not alter the right of the Sudanese to decide their future. The Governor-General would resist any form of direct Egyptian administration, which would be contrai\ to the protocol. The following is a further extract from the Sudan Monthly Record: “ Public anxiety and controversy began, however, to shift from the question whether British acknow ledg ment of Egyptian sovereignty meant a change in status, and, if so, a breach oi Mr. Bevin s promise of 26th March, to the profound differences now made public between press reports of Sidky Pasha’s interpretation of the protocol and the description of it given to the British House of Commons on 28th October. Mr. Attlee had said there would be no change in status noi oi administration and no impairment of the Sudanese right ultimately to decide their own future. Sidky Pasha was reported by the Cairene dailies to have stated that the draft implied a full share for Egypt in the administration, and no right of ultimate secession should the Sudanese wish to take that course; independence could, however, later be granted by Egypt, though Sidky Pasha thought the demand for it could never arise. Less eminent commentators in all three countries continued to give thoroughly confusing and contradictory interpreta tions, until the most widespread public feeling in the Sudan appeared to have become one of impatience with the vei bal quibbling which the formula invited and to which the negotiations appeared to have been reduced, tempered with anxiety as to what would have to be done should the outcome be as thoroughly unsatisfactory as the published differ ences over interpretation appeared to be. The feeling of resentment that the future of the country should be so bandied between the Co-domini and between the Egyptian political parties, without con sultation of the Sudanese, remained strong.” d 2 86-1020 59. On 6th December Sir O. Sargent, on instructions from the Secretary of State, handed an aide-memoire to the Egyptian Ambassador in the following terms :— “ His Majesty’s Government would like Sidky Pasha to be reminded of the understandings reached in London. His Majesty’s Government are now in an extremely awkward position as a result of the leakages and Sidky Pasha’s one sided interpretation. They have a House of Commons and public opinion which could not agree that the Sudanese, far from being placed on the road to self- government, should be set one stage back and made subject, so far as their liberty of choice is concerned, to the Egyptian Government. His Majesty’s Govern ment therefore wish for letters of inter pretation which in no way prejudice the Egyptian position, in no way go beyond what Sidky Pasha agreed in London, but which set out in more detail the purpose of the Sudan Protocol as His Majesty’s Government understand it. Mr. Bevin has been trying to meet Sidky Pasha’s difficulty over a letter, and has worked out a wording which will, he thinks, prove acceptable to him. This text is attached. “ Mr. Bevin would like Amr Pasha to understand, and explain to Sidky Pasha, that if His Majesty’s Government do not get letters of interpretation he will have to make a full statement in the House of Commons at the time of ratification, referring to all that Sidky Pasha had agreed in London and to His Majesty’s Government’s clear-cut interpretation of the meaning of the protocol. If Mr. Bevin is forced to make a statement of this kind it may prove far more difficult for Sidky Pasha than a letter of inter pretation on the lines of the enclosed draft. “ Mr. Bevin’s statement in the House would explain what is at the back of the Sudan Protocol, namely, the preparation of the Sudanese for self-government, and secondly the exercise of their right, when ripe for self-government, to choose their future status, which includes indepen dence. The House would be told how the phrase ‘ under a common crown ’ had been inserted in the protocol. This was a recognition of symbolic sovereignty and was never intended as a brake on the wheel of Sudanese progress towards independence. His Majesty’s Govern ment could never in this age and with the spirit of the United Nations Charter guiding them in their foreign policy, accept the idea that the protocol had m some way imposed some check upon the Sudanese in the choice of their future status. As regards the present position in the Sudan, Mr. Bevin would say in the House that the protocol involved no change but merely amounted to an affir mation of the existing status. Undt^phe protocol His Majesty’s Government w r ould continue to secure the defence of the Sudan with all the necessary facilities.” The enclosure embodied the points listed in paragraph 52 above. 60. On 7th December the Governor- General, on his return to Khartoum, issued a public statement, based on Mr. Attlee’s letter to him quoted in paragraph 50, which made it clear that he had Mr. Attlee’s authority to give the assurances in question to the Sudanese. This state ment was received with considerable bitter ness in Cairo, and on 8th December the Egyptian Government issued a communi que dissociating themselves from the state ment and regretting that “ the Governor- General of the Sudan, who represents the British and Egyptian Governments, allowed himself to make a declaration in accordance with an authority from the head of one of the Governments which the head of the Egyptian Government did not see and approve.” 61. On 8th December Sidky Pasha resigned the Premiership, ostensibly on grounds of ill-health (His Excellency had, in fact, been undergoing drastic medical treatment) but in reality, as His Majesty’s Embassy were informed in confidence, because King Farouk had come to the con clusion that Sidky’s relations with His Majesty’s Government had become too strained, and that he was too much compro mised by his various statements about the treaty for any progress to be made. The Governor-General’s declaration was not, apparently, a motive for the Pasha’s resignation. Before leaving office Sidky had replied to His Majesty’s Government’s aide-memoire of 6th December in a written communication which constituted a flat rejection of all the suggestions placed before him. But since the document was never alluded to again in Egypt, it is superfluous to quote it here. 62. Nokrashi Pasha succeeded Sidky Pasha as Prime Minister. In his reply to the Royal Rescript of appointment, he said that £ ‘ Egypt has undertaken to direct the Sudan towards progress in different domains of life with a view to attaining21 self-government within the framework of permanent unity with Egypt under the Egyptian Crown.” In his first speech in the Chamber of Deputies Nokrashi Pasha declared that “ in affirming the permanent unity of Egypt and the Sudan under the Crown of Egypt we are only expressing thfc^ull and desire of the inhabitants of this valley” and again that “everybody must know that when I say ‘ unity of Egypt and the Sudan under the Egyptian Crown ’ I mean a permanent unity .... This unity derives from the will of the people of the valley, the will of the people of Egypt and that of the people of the Sudan without distinction .... I repeat that the unity of Egypt and the Sudan will continue always and that no Egyptian could admit the separation of Egypt and the Sudan.” 63. In an appreciation dated 18th December, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires said that “ the various declara tions made by Sidky and the Governor- General have excited the Egyptian public to a point where no Egyptian Prime Minister, least of all the head of a minority Government, could dare to go against it. The Egyptian refusal to admit the right of the Sudan to secede is largely based on the belief that the British are encouraging the Sudanese to secede in' order to complete their policy of getting the Egyptians out preparatory to taking over themselves. No Egyptian can believe in the existence of a Sudanese public opinion, or in the possi bility of the Sudanese being allowed to express their opinions in the Sudan.” 64. Against this ominous background His Majesty’s Ambassador returned to Egypt on 20th December. There then ensued a series of stubborn arguments in the course of which Nokrashi Pasha pressed repeatedly for a unilateral state ment that (») His Majesty’s Government had no intention of encouraging the Sudanese to separate themselves from Egypt, and (b) that if the Sudanese even tually chose to remain united with Egypt His Majesty’s Government would put no obstacle in the way and would be happy to see this happen. Nokrashi justified his insistence on the ground of the inflamed state of Egyptian opinion; but he showed no disposition whatever to agree, in return, to the joint statement for which His Majesty’s Government continued to press as an alternative to an exchange of letters which Nokrashi, like Sidky, rejected. Furthermore, Nokrashi hinted broadly that the present deadlock could not be removed except by the amendment of the Bevin- Sidky protocol. All he would concede was that a statement by His Majesty’s Govern ment on the lines suggested would make “conversations more fruitful.” Public opinion in Egypt was further excited by the unauthorised disclosure of an address given by the Governor-General of the Sudan to Sudanese notables at El Obeid, and by declarations also made, on his return to Khartoum from London, by Sayed Abdel Rahman. On 31st December Nokrashi made a statement in the Chamber of Deputies in which he insisted that His Majesty’s Government must indicate their precise intentions in the Sudan, since it was inconceivable that Egypt could sacri fice her security by allowing the propaga tion in the Sudan of a policy tending towards separation. 65. On 4th January, 1947, the Foreign Secretary telegraphed a fresh proposal to His Majesty’s Ambassador for communi cation to Nokrashi. This proposal, which, with the accompanying review of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Sudan, is reproduced in Annex 7, con sisted of two alternatives either (a) the signature of the treaty of mutual assis tance including the evacuation protocol but excluding the Sudan protocol, with an understanding that the Convention of 1899 and article 11 of the 1936 treaty would remain in force, to be followed by a conference on the Sudan question at which the United Kingdom. Egypt and the Sudan would be represented, or (b) signature of all the treaty drafts but on the under standings (1) that the right of the Sudanese to choose their status was not restricted, (2) that, whatever the choice, a solemn pledge would be given by His Majesty’s Government that safeguards would be provided for Egypt’s permanent interests. Further, if either alternative were accepted. His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to make the unilateral state ment demanded by Nokrashi. 66. Two conversations followed between Nokrashi and Sir R. Campbell, the upshot of which was that Nokrashi suggested what was virtually a new Sudan Protocol in the form of terms of reference to a conference. His draft ran as follows :— “ The High Contracting Parties, with a view to assuring the well-being of the Sudanese, the development of their interests and their active preparation for self-government on the basis of the unity of Egypt and the Sudan under the common Crown of Egypt, agree to enter immediately on a conference on the22 Sudan at which United Kingdom and Egypt will be represented and at which the Sudanese will be consulted. “ Until self-government is achieved, the agreement of 1899 will continue and article 11 of the treaty of 1936, together with its annexes and paragraphs 14—16 of the agreed minutes annexed to the same treaty, will remain in force not withstanding the first article of the present treaty.” As was pointed out in a reply despatched on 9th January, this draft “excludes any wording about the Sudanese having the right to choose their future status, while proposing a conference (at which the Sudanese would apparently not be repre sented) to consider the future of the Sudan on the basis of Egypt’s claim to ‘ the unity of Egypt and the Sudan under the common Crown of Egypt.’ His Majesty’s Govern ment could not, of course, enter into a conference to consider the future of the Sudan if the main issue had been pre judged in this way by the terms of reference.” As regards alternative (6), however, the Foreign Secretary suggested that ‘ ‘ we might set forth in a document to be made public the viewpoint of Egypt and of Great Britain on the future of the Sudan.” The draft of such a statement is reproduced, for the purposes of record, in Annex 8. It was understood that His Majesty’s Government would, if this draft were accepted, also make the unilateral statement desired by Sidky. The Foreign Secretary indicated, moreover, that he would be prepared to receive Nokrashi Pasha in London for discussion if he wished for it. 67. Nokrashi Pasha rejected proposal (a) out of hand. He appreciated that (b) was an effort to meet him, but rejected it on the ground that it “ was unfair to Egypt” and “ put Egypt in an invidious light” by its implication (to him) that Great Britain was posing as having to protect the interests of the Sudan against an Egypt with evil intentions. Nokrashi then proceeded to argue that the difference of approach of the two sides to the Sudan question made agreement impossible. Egypt took it for granted—-regarded it as an axiom—that the Sudanese desired union with Egypt. This was the factual approach. His Majesty’s Government considered that the Sudanese might desire independence, and thereby encouraged “ ambitious ” people to create secessionist movements which were not the outcome of the will of the people. This was the hypo thetical approach. Nokrashi, moreover, hinted that, given this difference of approach, a visit by himself to London could hardly advance matters. To sum up, no progress was registered; and a further appeal to reason by the Foreign Secretary and a conversation between Sir R. Campbell and King Farouk left matters where they were, except to confirm jjiat Nokrashi was no longer prepared to ai jpt the Bevin-Sidky text, and that owing to the wide divergence of views there would be no point in his going to London. 68. The Egyptian Chamber of Deputies and Senate met on 20th and 21st January respectively. In the Chamber Nokrashi Pasha said that if his conversations with His Majesty’s Ambassador did not result in an agreement, he would ‘ ‘ find another way” for the realisation of the country’s claims. On this basis the Chamber adjourned the debate until 27th January. The Senate passed a resolution “ deciding that Egypt and the Sudan form an indivisible whole and that .... the man date given by the head of the British Government to the Governor-General .... affirms the will and policy of Great Britain aiming at the separation of the Sudan from Egypt and its colonisation.” Finally, the Senate “ decides that the moment has come for the Egyptian Government to expedite firm action to confront the unfriendly attitude which Great Britain has adopted with regard to Egypt; and requests the Government to communicate to it the measures which it will take to achieve that object.” 69. As though to prove how factual the Egyptian approach to the Sudan question was, thirteen Sudanese tribal leaders, representing 1,200,000 persons, presented to the Advisory Council for the Northern Sudan, which met on 1st January, a memorandum totally rejecting any foreign sovereignty over the Sudan and declaring that the authors claimed the right of nations to freedom and to determine their future for themselves. This meeting of the Advisory Committee should have been held in November, but was postponed by the Sudan Government owing to the political excitement following Sidky’s disclosures, Moreover, members of the leading political parties had declared a boycott of the council (and, incidentally, of the Governor- General’s Sudanisation committees), but this was called off by the independence groups late in December. 70. On 23rd January the Egyptian Ambassador communicated to the Foreign Secretary a message from Nokrashi Pasha to the effect that by 27th January he, Nokrashi, must either announce agreement or state that the matter would be referred23 i the Security Council. After discussion with Amr Pasha, the Foreign Secretary decided to make yet another proposal for a revised Sudan protocol in the following terms :— (1) The policy which the High Contract ing Parties undertake to follow in ^ the Sudan (within the framework ^ of the unity between the Sudan and Egypt under the common Crown of Egypt) will have for its essential objectives to assure the well-being of the Sudanese, the development of their interests and their active preparation for self-government. (2) The High Contracting Parties agree to the following procedure to give effect to the above :— (a) On matters of policy affecting the Sudan, the welfare of the Sudanese, their prepara tion for self-government, the high contracting parties will from time to time consult each other and the Sudanese. (b) In pursuance of this procedure the high contracting parties recognise that when the stage is reached for the Sudanese people to decide their future status they will be free to exercise their choice in accordance with their politi cal aspirations and in accord ance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning non-self- governing territories. (3) Until the high contracting parties can in full common agreement realise this latter objective after consultation with the Sudanese, the Agreement of 1899 will continue and article 11 of the Treaty of 1936, together with its annex and paragraphs 14 to 16 of the agreed minute annexed to the same tieaty, will remain in force notwithstand ing the first article of the present treaty. (4) In any event the high contracting parties agree to take the necessary steps to safeguard their respective interests. The Foreign Secretary offered at the same time to state in writing that “ His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom hold that the free choice of the Sudanese people as to their future cannot be restricted, although if the Sudanese eventually choose to continue with the framework of the unity between the Sudan and Egypt under the common Crown of Egypt, His Majesty‘s Government will place no obstacle in their way.’ He also offered to make a statement in the House of Commons to the same effect. 71. Nokrashi immediately took exception to various aspects of the above text, but agreed to submit it to his Cabinet, though without conviction. His main objection was, as before, to the explicit mention of free choice. However, in a final effort to meet Nokrashi, the Foreign Secretary— acting on a hint that Nokrashi’s text quoted in paragraph above might give him the link for which he was searching— proposed the following alternative to paragraph 2 (b) of his latest proposal, viz.:— “ In pursuance of this procedure the high contracting parties agree that when full self-government is achieved on the basis of paragraph 1, the Sudanese will not be denied by the high contracting parties the right to determine their future status in accordance with their political aspirations and in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning non-self- governing territories.” Sir R. Campbell was not to put forward this proposal unless discussion was resumed and he regarded it as helpful. In fact, it was overtaken by events, but is included for record. 72. On the evening of 25th January Nokrashi Pasha handed to Sir R. Campbell a decision of the Egyptian Council of Ministers that “ the Egyptian Govern ment have gone towards agreement with the British Government to the furthest possible extent. Nevertheless, they found that the proposals offered by the British side do not satisfy our natural rights. Therefore, the Council of Ministers have decided to present the country’s case before the Security Council.” 73. The statement in which the Foreign Secretary informed the House of Commons of the breakdown of negotiations is con tained in full in Annex 9. 74. A statement made by Nokrashi Pasha to the press on 3rd March on the breakdown and the Prime Minister's state ment in the House of Commons on 11th March are printed as Annexes 10 and 11. Egyptian Department, Foreign Office, 12th March, 1947.24 Annex 1 Aide memoire The object of the new treaty of alliance in our view is to strengthen by mutual co-operation between Great Britain and Egypt the contributions which each party will be able to make to the maintenance of international peace and security in accord ance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The security of Egypt and of the British Commonwealth can be vitally threatened by an attack on the Middle East area. This has been con clusively demonstrated in two wars. Action by the United Nations to halt aggression will be greatly strengthened by the taJking of adequate security measures by the countries having interests in common. Egypt’s part in these security arrange ments will throw an increased respon sibility upon the Egyptian armed forces in preparing to defend their country and the British Government will facilitate in every way the provision of modern equip ment. Nevertheless, smaller countries, however tenaciously they may defend them selves, stand no chance in modern war against a powerful aggressor unless they can receive full and immediate support, for which preparations must be made in peace time, from a Power possessing a military and economic potential compar able to that of the aggressor. It is, there fore, essential that Egypt should be sure of immediate aid in face of a serious threat. 2. The British delegation have been studying how to give expression to the measures necessary to achieve this object and they are considering putting forward proposals on the following lines. 3. In the first place all British naval combatant forces and all fighting troops of the British army will be entirely with drawn from Egypt. This withdrawal will be effected on a programme, and will be completed as rapidly as possible having regard to the necessity for liquidating the aftermath of war. The programme would be drawn up in such a way as first to effect the progressive and complete evacuation of Cairo and Alexandria. All squadrons of the Royal Air Force will similarly be with drawn though it is proposed that a small number of fighter squadrons should remain in the Canal zone to co-operate with the Royal Egyptian Air Force in the provision of an air defence which is of vital import ance for the security of the Middle East as a whole. 4. The treaty should provide for the giving of mutual assistance in the event of unprovoked aggression. In order that the assistance to be given by Great Britain i* Egypt can be prompt and effective, the Egyptian Government should undertake to maintain facilities for an Allied adminis trative base and an air defence comprising airfields, a signals network, and radar installations. The purpose of the adminis trative base would be to hold reserve sMres and to provide workshops and similar facilities so that, in the event of emergency, the forces coming to the assistance of Egypt can be maintained as soon as they arrive. The British Government would undertake to furnish technical assistance in the form of administrative specialists and skilled personnel in order to help in the establishment and maintance of the base and air defence organisation. It will be realised that there is at present a very large administrative organisation in Egypt which has been of vital importance to the conduct of operations in the various theatres of war, and which must continue to operate while the various war-time commit ments are being liquidated. It would be the intention of the British Government to reduce this administrative organisation as rapidly as possible down to the size which would be maintained jointly under the treaty. 5. An Allied headquarters will be essen tial to deal with the execution of the above and to act as a headquarters for concerting security measures throughout the Middle East. It is proposed that this headquarters should be established in the Canal zone. 6. It is proposed that the Egyptian Government should accord to the forces of the British Government facilities in the Canal zone for occasional transit. Annex 2 Note Presented to the British Delega tion by the Egyptian Prime Minister On Saturday 20th April, Sidky Pasha summoned the officers forming the military bureau attached to the Egyptian delega tion for the negotiations and communicated to them the aide-memoire which had been handed to him on the previous day by his Excellency the British Ambassador and Lord Stansgate. Their first reaction was wholly unfavour able. Sidky Pasha explained to them that he was only asking their technical opinion on the matter. He begged them to study the British sug gestions objectively putting all considera tions of sentiment to one side.25 “■ The suggestions should,' he told them, “ be regarded from the following angle. “ We are two allies of unequal strength who may have to face a powerful and rapid act of aggression launched by an enemy of not less strength than Great Britain. Whatever Egyptian preparations may be, th'^ defence cannot be immediately in a state capable of repulsing the invader; our British allies must therefore intervene at once and they consider that the defence may prove to be ineffective without the presence in our country of a nucleus form ing in advance an ‘ allied administrative base ’ whose composition is set out in detail in the note and whose purpose will be to prepare in time of peace for the reception of troops and reinforcement formations.' “ Consider this without being influenced by the political aspect of the suggestion; I only ask you for a military opinion.' The members of the bureau have handed their opinion, in the form of the attached note^ 1 ) to Sidky Pasha this evening. The Prime Minister, after a personal examination of the British aide-memoire which was handed to him on 19th April and of the above note from his military bureau, can only give his entire support to the latter’s conclusions. He adds the following considerations which will be the last after the series of considerations which he has developed orally or in writing in recent days: — 1. There is no longer any doubt that, in the form set forth in the aide-memoire communicated on 19th April, the base asked for in Egyptian territory constitutes a veritable military occupation of this territory. 2. This base, to which is added a British air force contingent, presents such a variety of aspects—including notably a veritable headquarters belonging to a foreign army—that the fiction consisting in saying that it simply involves an allied base cannot take away its true character from it. 3. By the arrangement suggested by the aide-memoire the alliance between the two countries is reduced to a military tutelage exercised by a big country over a smaller country which will rapidly degenerate—as in fact has happened—into political supre macy. An alliance based on equality cannot involve more than consultations and conversations between Staffs to arrive at a rational use of forces and preparation in common of defence plans. (p Not included. 86-10 4. Egypt would go as far as possible m this way since she envisages a development of the cultural help to be furnished by British schools for military instruction and a harmonious choice of the arms to be employed. 5. The development of the power and effectiveness of the new Egyptian army, planned as a sign of the true and final liberation of the country, could not but suffer from the position of inferiority which would be created by the presence of a British base, of which the undoubted influence would halt or discourage many initiatives. The facts of a recent past are there to prove it. 6. The same influence will continue to be exercised in the political field notwith standing the assurances, often dictated by incontestable good faith, which are offered. This is ground on to which the present note does not wish to venture, since it would involve needlessiy the examination of a past which gave little reason for confidence. 7. After the final disappearance of the reasons wdiich determined the measures contemplated by the treaty of 1936. a country like Egypt could not agree that its independence should remain at the mercy of new and various reasons which the political repertory is never at a loss to discover. An independent country should provide for its own security from its own resources, and this should be so in Egypt’s case; she does not want to fail in this task, but her dignity as a free country cannot but refuse to alienate her independence as a result of exaggerated and almost imagi nary anxieties as to probable dangers. And if this could be explained to some extent before the last war, it would no longer be understood, since the creation of the mechanism of world security inaugu rated at San Francisco, how an indepen dent country could cheerfully allow its liberty to be fettered by benevolent agree ments of doubtful efficacy. 8. It is now apparently a question of a danger from the East, just as later on, and even after the end of the alliance, it may be a question of quite a different danger resulting from the difficulties of the moment, or from any other product of the always fertile imagination of Chancel leries. 9. It is not the aim of the present note to expatiate on the extent of the dangers to which world peace is exposed. But may we remark that these perils are often presented in a light in which a sometimes deliberate pessimism plays a leading part. E26 Russian policy is certainly disturbing; but it is more suspicious than dangerous, and if the danger which it presents can arise from its immediate and neighbouring interests, Kgypt cannot in any case be the country against which its first act of aggression would take place, an act which distance and the presence of other inter mediate countries, placed under British rule or influence, would render as inexplicable as it was inoperative. 10. In brief, and whatever may be the goodwill of the Egyptian negotiator or his influence on his compatriots, he would find it, if not impossible, at least very difficult to convince them that their hopes for the independence of their country and the integrity of its territory will have been substantially realised by the application of the last suggestions contained in the British note. In regard to Sidky Pasha personally, he regrets that he cannot support such suggestions, which, moreover, are far from being in accordance with the terms of his mandate. 11. And since in regard to Great Britain, the friend and ally of his country, he has obligations dictated by loyalty and sincerity, he owes it to himself to issue a warning that, as he has many times pointed out, a movement of public opinion (stimu lated to an equal degree by different causes and currents) may at any moment trans form itself into an action which it was possible to repress or contain at the beginning of the present political cam paign, but which may subsequently elude all control. Sidky Pasha would be grateful if the foregoing considerations, as well as the technical note, could be communicated to Mr. Bevin. (Initialled) I. S. 21s£ April, 1946.

Until the high contracting parties can in full common agreement realise this latter objective after consulta tion with the Sudanese, the Agreement of 1899 will continue and Article 11 of the Treaty of 1936. together with its annex and paragraphs 14 to 16 of the agreed minute annexed to the same treaty, will remain in force notwithstanding the first article of the present treaty. (3) Evacuation Protocol The high contracting parties agree that the complete evacuation of Egyptian terri tory (Egypt) by the British forces shall be completed by 1st September, 1949.31 • The towns of Cairo and Alexandria and the delta shall be evacuated by 31st March, 1947. The evacuation of the remainder of the country shall proceed continuously during the period ending at the date speci fied in the first paragraph above. The provisions of the convention of 26th Au^st, 1936, concerning immunities and pri^meges will continue provisionally to be applied to the British forces during the period of their withdrawal from Egypt. Such amendment of the agreement as may be necessary in view of the fact that British troops will after 31st March, 1947, be withdrawn from the delta and the two cities shall be settled by a subsequent agree ment between the two Governments to be negotiated before this date. Confidential Record of Conversation between Sidky Pasha and Mr. Bevin concerning the Evacuation Protocol 1. It is understood that the Egyptian Government will lend their co-operation and provide the facilities which the Gov ernment of the United Kingdom require in order to enable them to carry out with drawals of the forces provided for in the evacuation protocol. 2. With reference to paragraph 2 of the evacuation protocol it is understood that the British personnel required to man the wireless stations at Abbassia, Maadi and Heliopolis, may remain at their present stations until a new location is found for these wireless stations. This will be done as soon as possible. 3. The disposal of the installations, stores of material, equipment and com munication facilities made or accumulated by British forces in Egypt, shall be settled by the two Governments on the advice of their respective experts. 4. It is understood that financial terms on which any installations, stores, equip ment and communication facilities which the Egyptian Government may wish to acquire shall be transferred to that Govern ment will be the subject of later discussion between the two Governments. 5. It is understood that until the com pletion of the evacuation in accordance with the provisions of the evacuation pro tocol, the British forces shall continue to enjoy their present rights of transit and flight over Egypt. It is also understood that the two Governments shall, after the signature of the treaty of alliance, discuss with a view to arriving at a mutual agree ment the transit rights which shall be enjoyed for their aircraft by the British forces after the evacuation of Egypt is completed. Reciprocal treatment will also be accorded to Egyptian air forces in British territory. 6. It is understood the abrogation of the treaty of 1936 does not affect the position of either party with regard to financial rights and liabilities which had accrued under the treaty of 1936 at the time of the coming into force of the new treaty of alliance which abrogates it. 26^ October, 1946. Annex 7 Mr. Bevin to Sir R. Campbell (Cairo) (No. 24) Foreign Office, (Telegraphic) 3rd January, 1947 I have given further and very careful thought to the whole situation affecting the treaty and the Sudan Protocol. At the outset I must reiterate that His Majesty's Government's policy in this matter has not changed. The whole basis of entering into these discussions was to secure friendly co-operation with Egypt in all matters, and in them I have made His Majesty's Govern ment’s position plain right through. Nokrashi completely ignores the essential point in Sidky s reply to me when I said that I wanted to make it quite clear to the British people that nothing was being done to prejudice the Sudanese people’s right of self-determination. Sidky replied “ that if the Sudanese reached a certain point of development, they would surely become independent. Nothing on paper could prejudice the right of independence nor could it bind a people in search of liberty. It was a universal principle and not a matter for incorporation in a treaty.' He went on to say that as the proposed treaty was based on the United Nations Charter, which affirms independence of nations, he felt it was unnecessary in any new agreement to repeat what had already been specified in the United Nations Charter. 2. I regard that as an explicit under taking that nothing we were doing would interfere with the Sudanese exercising self-determination at some future date if they so desired. In the meantime we agreed to prepare them for self-government, and I did recognise that our joint policy in the Sudan would be within the framework of the unity between the Sudan and Egypt, under the common Crown of Egypt. 3. Further, nothing was to be done to interfere with the administration as estab lished, and I was asked to accept a short32 and simple text in the place of one providing for a commission to make recom mendations on the future of the Sudan. 4. To meet the Egyptians, I agreed to recommend this course to the British Cabinet. As I see the position, I am now asked to subscribe to Sidky’s indiscretions and acquiesce in his attempt to saddle His Majesty’s Government with an under taking which I did not agree to recommend, and that I am afraid—whatever the conse quences—I cannot do. Really, Nokrashi must eradicate the opinion created here by Sidky. 5. I have already made it quite clear to my colleagues in His Majesty’s Govern ment that the principle I was following was to initiate and develop an era oi co-operation; that I recognised that economically the Sud^n was vital to Egypt; that nothing must be done which would have the effect of creating (in the words of the Egyptian negotiators) an “ unfriendly Sudan ”; and that if at some future date, which we all agreed was a good way off, such an event took place entailing independence, there would then be the dual obligation to use all our influence to protect the economic necessities of Egypt. 6. It has been suggested that while administering the Sudan we are deliberately and wilfully intending to encourage secession. The answer to that is “ No.” for the mere fact that I offered that a commission should, after a certain delay, examine the whole position jointly, is an indication of our approach to the problem. But I must repeat that His Majesty’s Government cannot deprive the Sudanese, to use Sidky’s own words, of the right, when they reach a certain point of development, to become independent, if they so wish. His Majesty’s Government cannot under such circumstances bind themselves now or future Governments of Great Britain to oppose that development, but in the meanwhile our policy of mutual effort and collaboration stands. 7. Having thus made clear my position, I can only put forward the following suggestions in the hope they may provide Nokrashi with an alternative to the position which has unfortunately been created. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to sign the treaty of mutual assistance, including the evacuation protocol initialled with Sidky Pasha, but excluding the Sudan Protocol, subject to an understanding that the convention of 1899 and article 11 of the 1936 treaty remains in force—and thereafter to proceed to a conference on the Sudan question at which the United Kingdom, Egypt and the Sudan would be represented. Alternatively, His Majesty’s Government would be ready to sign the treaty with the Sudan Protocol, but on the understanding indicated above, i.e .— (1) that the Sudanese right to o^oose their future status is not restricted; (2) that, whatever the choice, a solemn pledge will be given by His Majesty’s Government that suitable safeguards will be provided for Egypt’s permanent interests: in other words, making it clear, as to (1), that I have not, for any con sideration, bartered away a people’s rights which, whether we conclude a treaty or not. we are not prepared to do, especially when those rights may—in Sidky’s words—be exer cised in circumstances that cannot now be foreseen. 8. I can say definitely that, provided we reach an honest understanding and a square deal, the policy of His Majesty’s Government is to provide the interests of the economic development of the peoples concerned and to remove the Sudan ques tion from the state of controversy in which it has been. But if Nokrashi remains immovable I would like you to ask whether it is any use trying to make any further effort in understanding or whether we must allow the 1936 treaty to continue. 9. I would emphasise that the only thing in dispute between Egypt and Great Britain is the Sudan Protocol. Everything else is settled. On the Sudan Protocol the only thing in dispute is whether two parties will enter into a treaty depriving a third party of its rights, which may be exercised at some distant date. 10. If Nokrashi, on his side, is ready to agree to one or the other of the above alternatives in paragraph 7, I for my part am prepared to make a statement (as suggested in your telegram No. 1942) namely, that His Majesty’s Government have no intention of encouraging the Sudanese to separate themselves from Egypt and, if the Sudan eventually chooses to remain united to Egypt, His Majesty’s Government will place no obstacle in the way and will be happy to see this happen. Otherwise I should be forced to add to such a statement a clear explanation of His Majesty’s Government’s position as stated in the present telegram. I am saying nothing for the moment but I cannot be asked to remain silent indefinitely in view of the growing feelings in this33 country with which I, no less than Nokrashi, have to reckon, the more so as they have in my view fullest justification. 11. Please put the foregoing to Nokrashi. I regard this telegram as so important that, if you think it wise, you can read Nokrashi the full text. Annex 8 Mr. Bevin to Sir R. Campbell (Cairo) (No. 56) Foreign Office, (Telegraphic) 9^ January, 1947 Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram. The United Kingdom and Egypt being conscious that the future circumstances are not now known in which the choice of the Sudanese people as to their future status will be exercised, have agreed to reserve this question and to discuss it together and with the Sudanese peoples when the time comes. 2. They have however decided at this stage to make their respective points of view known as follows. 3. The Egyptian Government on the one hand are unable to commit themselves to a statement now that they will in the future support the view that the Sudanese peoples, when they have reached the stage of self- government, shall be unrestricted in the choice of their future status. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on the other hand hold that the free choice of the Sudanese peoples as to their future status cannot be restricted, although if the Sudanese eventually choose to continue in unity with Egypt under the common Crown of Egypt or to form some closer kind of union with Egypt, His Majesty’s Government will place no obstacle in the way. 4. Finally, the high contracting parties recognise that, in regard to the future status of the Sudanese people, regard will be had to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the rights and the political aspirations of peoples. Annex 9 Mr. Bevin to Sir R. Campbell (Cairo) No. 203) Foreign Office, Telegraphic) 21th January, 1947 Following is text of my statement made in House of Commons this afternoon :— I have been informed by the Egyptian Government that they have broken off negotiations for a revision of the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The House will be aware that when the Egyptian Government requested His Majesty’s Government to enter into nego tiations for the revision of the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty of 1936, His Majesty’s Government, although they were not bound to do so by the terms of the treaty, willingly acceded to that request. In May last, His Majesty’s Government proposed the withdrawal of all British forces from Egypt and to settle by negotia tion the stages of the evacuation and arrangements for mutual defence to take the place of those embodied in the 1936 Treaty, at the same time making it clear that in default of the negotiation of a new treaty, the provisions of the Treaty of 1936 would stand. Negotiations in Cairo pro ceeded slowly until finally in the middle of October the then Egyptian Prime Minister visited this country in an endeavour to settle the major differences which had hitherto stood in the way of agreement. These differences were concerned, first of all, with the obligations of the respective parties in the event of their being the object of attack or in the event of a threat of war developing in the region of the Middle East; the period within which the withdrawal of British forces and installa tions from Egypt should be completed, and the question of the Sudan. As a result of the conversations which I had with Sidky Pasha, we were able to reach, on a personal basis and subject to the approval of our respective constitutional organs, full agree ment on the texts of a treaty of mutual assistance, an evacuation protocol, and a Sudan Protocol. Sidky Pasha undertook to recommend the texts to his Government and I undertook, for my part, to recom mend them to the Cabinet if they were endorsed and put forward to me officially by Egypt. Of the questions in dispute, by far the most difficult was that of the Sudan. My own position in the matter was that I had given a pledge in this House on 26th March last that no change should be made in the status of the Sudan as a result of treaty revision until the Sudanese had been con sulted through constitutional channels. After taking, however, the highest legal advice, I felt that for the sake of an agree ment which would have been as much in the interests of the Sudanese as of either of the other parties, I should be justified in alluding in the Sudan Protocol to the existence of a symbolic dynastic union 86-10 F34 between Egypt and the Sudan, provided always that no change was introduced into the existing system of administration whereby the Sudan is administered by the Governor-General under the powers con ferred on him by the 1899 Agreements as confirmed and interpreted by the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty of 1936; and provided that no change took place in the arrange ments under which the defence of the Sudan is assured. The text agreed upon by Sidky Pasha and myself on the above basis read as follows :— “ The policy which the high contract ing parties undertake to follow in the Sudan within the framework of the unity between the Sudan and Egypt under the common Crown of Egypt will have for its essential objectives to assure the well-being of the Sudanese, the development of their interests and their active preparation for self-government and consequently the exercise of the right to choose the future status of the Sudan. Until the high contracting parties can in full common agreement realise this latter objective after con sultation with the Sudanese, the Agree ment of 1899 will continue and article 11 of the Treaty of 1936, together with its annex and paragraphs 14 to 16 of the agreed minute annexed to the same treaty, will remain in force notwith standing the first article of the present treaty.” I would draw particular attention to the right assured to the Sudanese by this text to choose the future status of the Sudan. In the course of our discussions this point oame up more than once. I, for my part, made it clear that nothing must be done, and that I must be able to assure the British people that nothing was being done, to prejudice the right of the Sudanese, after they had attained self- government, ultimately to exercise their choice—a development which it would take some time to realise. Sidky Pasha sub scribed to the view that nothing on paper could prejudice the right of independence nor could it bind a people in search of liberty. This, as his Excellency admitted, was a universal principle, and not a matter for incorporation in a treaty. I assumed, therefore, and I had good reason to assume, that agreement existed between us that the Sudanese, when the time came for them to make the choice of their future status, would not be debarred from choosing com plete independence, just as they would be free to choose some form of association with Egypt, or even complete union with Egypt. Scarcely, however, had Sidky Pasha left this country than reports appeared, and appeared without contradiction, that His Majesty’s Government had conceded the unity of Egypt and the Sudan withou^Ihe ultimate right of self-determination. nis publication gave rise to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister’s statement on 28th October, 1946. It was succeeded by other disclosures and, at later dates, by official utterances, which made it clear that in Egyptian eyes the political evolution of the Sudanese must stop short at self-government under the Egyptian Crown, and that the status of independence for the Sudan was unthinkable. Nokrashi Pasha, in fact, on assuming office stated in the Chamber of Deputies that 1 ‘ when I say unity of Egypt and the Sudan under the Egyptian Crown, I mean a permanent unity.” The first effect of these statements was to create a situation of extreme tension in the Sudan, where the numerically powerful parties favouring independence accused His Majesty’s Government most bitterly of breaking their pledge and of selling them to Egypt. Some rioting took place, but Sir Hubert Huddleston, the Governor- General, thanks to his great influence and to the confidence which he inspires in the Sudan, has been able to allay Sudanese anxiety, to restore confidence in the administration, and to persuade the Sudanese independence groups, who had declared a political boycott, again to collaborate with the organs of the Sudan Government instituted to promote the association of the Sudanese with the administration. The Governor-General has been the subject of bitter criticism in Egypt, which I deplore and which I regard as unjustified. But this clearly did not by itself go far enough. I could not, after what had passed, recommend the Sudan protocol to the Cabinet and to Parliament without securing an agreed interpretation of its terms which would not run counter to what the people of this country regard as the natural order of things, viz., that peoples having achieved self-government shall have the ultimate right to self-determination including a right to independence if they want it. I regret that all my efforts have failed to reach anything in the nature of an agreed interpretation, whether in the form of an exchange of letters, or of agreed statements to be made by the sookesmen of both sides, or even of agreed statements in35 tohich the difference separating the parties would be honestly declared in the hope that it could be composed later, since the ques tion at issue cannot become a live one for at least some years. I offered in addition, if any of these proposals were adopted, m^lf to make a public statement to re«ure Egypt as regards the aims of British policy in the Sudan. I have offered every guarantee for the safeguard of Egyptian interests in the Sudan—for no one realises more clearly than His Majesty’s Government how vital, for instance, is Egyptian interest in the waters of thfe Nile. I have offered to sign the treaty of mutual assistance and the evacua^ tion protocol—and thus realise one of Egypt’s most eager aspirations—and to discuss the Sudan question de novo at a conference with ohrselves and the Sudan ese. To all -these proposals I have received either ah uncompromising negative or proposals which would involve my re entering negotiatioris committed to the thesis that the right of the Sudanese to self-determination must be subject to per manent union between Egypt and the Sudan. I have even found myself accused of pursuing a policy of endeavouring to filch the Sudan from Egypt. My hope is that broader and less stubborn counsels may come to prevail in Cairo, for it is evident that the interests of both countries call for a fresh treaty and would justify 7 a further effort to reach agreement so as to enable the two countries to co operate for their mutual interest and defence. It is unfortunate that in the negotiations His Majesty’s Government have had to deal with a minority Govern ment, I stated to this House that the question of the Government was a matter for the Egyptians themselves. If, however, we can deal with a more fully representa tive Egyptian Government and if our negotiations can thereby avoid being the subject of Egyptian party conflicts, there will be a much better chance of carrying them through to a successful conclusion in the right spirit. Meanwhile the Treaty ot 1936 will be adhered to. Egyptian Prime Minister to London for the purpose of personally contacting Mr. Bevin. The final breaking oh of these negotiations may be attributed only to the inability of Egypt to obtain satisfaction on the following two essential points, which are claimed by the Egyptian people. 1. Evacuation of British troops from Egypt. This evacuation must be imme diate, complete, and not conditioned by a treaty. 2. Maintenance of the unity of Egypt and the Sudan, self-government for the Sudanese and restoration to Egypt of her rights in the administration in the Sudan in order to further the preparation of the Sudanese for self-government. The unity of Egypt and Sudan is the will of both Egyptians and Sudanese, whereas the British policy is directed towards inciting the Sudanese to secede from Egypt. As for self-government, had Egypt not been forcibly deprived of her rights in the administration of the Sudan, the prepara tion of the Sudanese for self-government would not be so delayed. Egypt is in a better position and is more anxious than Great Britain to prepare for self-govern ment a people of the same race, the same language, same religion and dependent for their very existence on the Nile. Egypt wants the Sudanese to be able as soon as possible to express their views freely, which can be accomplished only when British troops have evacuated the Sudan. The two preceding points are fair application of the principles of the Elnited Nations Charter. For that reason, after exceptionally pro longed negotiations, the Egyptian Govern ment, regretfully convinced that direct discussions held no hope of success, decided to appeal to the Security Council. This decision has received the enthusiastic endorsement of the entire Egyptian people. Egypt has abiding faith in United Nations and is absolutely confident that justice will be accorded to a small nation which has always firmly upheld the principles of the supremacy of inter national law. Annex 10 lokrasU Pasha’s Statement the Press on 3rd March The negotiations between Egypt and nd Britain began in April 1946 and lasted 5 n months during which the Egyptian ide earnestly tried in every way to come o an agreement. This was clearly demon- bra ted by the journey undertaken by the Annex 11 Mr. Attlee's Statement in the House of Commons on \lth March The statement issued by the Egyptian Prime Minister on the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations stated that the final breaking off 0 of these negotiations might be attri buted only to the inability of Egypt to obtain satisfaction on the following two36 essential points. One, the evacuation of British troops from Egypt. This evacua tion must be immediate, complete and not conditioned by a treaty. Two, the main tenance of the unity of Egypt and the Sudan, self-government for the Sudanese and the restoration to Egypt of her rights in the administration of the Sudan in order to further the preparation of the Sudanese for self-government. This declaration can best be judged in the light of the agreements reached between Sidky Pasha and the Foreign Secretary in London last October. These agreements provided for mutual arrange ments for defence, arrangements for evacuation and for the Sudan. The agree ments were initialled by the two statesmen in London ad referendum to their Govern ments. The Egyptian Government sub mitted them to the Egyptian Chamber of Deputies on 26th November, 1946, and received a vote of confidence. Thereupon the Egyptian Government informed His Majesty’s Government on 1st December that they were ready to sign the treaty and the two annexes dealing with evacuation and the Sudan. The Foreign Secretary, in his statement in the House of Commons on 27th January, made quite clear the sole reason why the signature did not, in fact, take place, namely, the endeavour of the Egyptian Government to construe one phrase of the protocol on the Sudan as meaning that they could rely on the sup port of His Majesty’s Government to deny to the Sudanese complete freedom of choice when the time came for them to choose their future status. The British Government had already agreed, as part of the above arrangements. to the complete evacuation of British troops in Egypt by 1949. This is not an excessive period for the winding up of the immense commitments built up by the British Army in Egypt, which was its main base for the war in which British arms saved Egypt from being overrun by the Nazis. As already indicated by the Foreign Secretary in this House, the British Government are also in favour of eventual self-government for the Sudanese, who, when the time comes for them to choose their future status would not be debarred from choosing complete independence or some form of association with Egypt or even complete union if they wished. It is not true, therefore, to say that “ British policy is directed towards inciting the Sudanese to secede from Egypt.” The Egyptian statement says that the Sudanese are a people of the same race, language and religion as the Egyptians. I should point out that the Sudanese com prise many races and types, Nilotic, Hamitic and Negro besides Arabs. Furthermore, out of approximately 7 million Sudanese, more than 2^ million are not Muslim nor Arabic speaking. It is also stated that the Sudanese will only be able to express their views freely when British troops have evacuated the Sudan. British troops, in common with Egyptian troops, are in the Sudan at the disposal of the Governor-General for the defence of that country. It is incorrect to say that the presence of either the British or the Egyptian troops makes it impossible for the Sudanese to express their views freely.Cypher/OI'P C-jrj}L\L DISTRIBUTION MILCAmO TO jf’QHLIGK ON?

It therefore may be useful to rgrp. undec: ? summarise] brief provision for mutual assistance in question. It was agreed that in the event (1) of Mgypt being attacked or (2) of the United Kingdom being involved in war as a result of an attack against countries adjacent to Egypt the two parties should take, in close co-operation and after consultation, such action as might be recognised necessary until the Security Council had taken necessary measures for peace. No comment is required on provision for attack on Egypt itself. As regards attack on countries adjacent to Egypt, it is perfectly clear that in any case Egypt could not remain neutral if Arab countries on her frontier became the scene of armed aggression. Her very existence would^ be menaced if her ^rab neighbours were conquered and their enemies installed in force on the Egyptian frontier which they would have little difficulty in crossing whenever they wished. It was also agreed that to ensure mutual co-operation and co-ordination of mutual defence some Anglo-Egyptian Board of Defence should be established. This Board was to be an advisory body whose function was to study and propose to the two Governments measures to be taken for mutual defence of both parties. Board was to examine, if so invited by the two Governments, military repercussions of the international situation, and in particular of all / events\ V' ~ 2 - events threatening the security of the Liddie East. The ^ Board was to make in this respect suitable recommendations t the two Governments who in the case of events threatening the security of any one of the neighbouring countries of Egypt would consult together in order to take in agreement such measures as might be necessary. It will be seen that this Board was merely to advise the two Governments and to study problems of defence and military repercussions of international .events, in particular of events threatening the security of the Liddle East countries with which Egypt is particularly connected. Is it conceivable that if for instance Syria or Iraq were to become the object of a menace Egypt could remain indifferent? mil that this treaty provision contemplated was that in such event England and Egypt should get together and examine [grp. undec.] measures they might take in agreement to deal with this menace to the frab countries with which Egypt is inextricably connected.

The Egyptians are certainly justified in objecting to this view, because this amounts to a .continuation of British domination as Egypt is a nominal partner in the Condominium. They rightly complain that the British 'proposals are not in consonance with the United Nations Charter an., that outside interference is sowing seeds of dissension between Egypt and the Sudan. Egypt too has yet to clarify her position on the Suuan s political future. While we sympathize with the Egyptian feeling that Britain is opposing the unity of the Nile Valley in a desperate bid to prolong her stay in both Egypt and the Sudan, we think that if Egypt takes her case to the U.N.0., as Nokrashy Pasha wants to .o, she will not find it easy to answer the British case on technical grounds. The 1936 treaty ensures its own continuance for ten years more in the event of a breakdown in the negotiations for its revision. Egypt will^-1 ''vJ ' also have to face the British allegation that the talk of Nile Vn-npv unity is only n smoke-SGreen for the annexation of the ^Sudan and for evading the terms of the United Nations Charter.

The one salient fact that emerges from the course of the negotiations is the tenacious and skilful way in which thu British Government is attempting in Egypt also, as in Burma, InPia and elsev/here, to postpone the evil ^ay of coloni^ independence by complicating the process of the transference of power. Two or three main questions c me up for prolong u discussion and ultimate disagreement.

But in spite of their objection, this elastic clausf has been retained in the Si^Bevin draft. The seconu matter on which the Egyptians feel strongly is the gueopon the evacuation of troops. They consiaer that the pbrxou ox three years provided in the draft is too long. Th y ^ that the war' ended more than a year ago and that forces ax- troops and 400 places allowed under the 1930 ceeding 10,000 _ Treaty should have been removea long ago.-4- But the most thorny question is the one concerning the future of the Sudan. The Bevin-Siclky formula provides that ;he policy which the two contracting parties undertake to pursue in the Sudan should have as its fundamental aims the realisation of the welfare of the people of the Sudan, the -promotion of their interests and their preparation in an effectual manner for se.lf- rovernment and consequently for the future free choice of the rorm of government for the Sudan; and that until the two parties, hy a joint agreement, achieve such aims in consultation with the Sudanese the provisions of the 1899 agreement and the Treaty of 1936 will remain in force. There was a regular Battle of inter- q&gt;retations over this clause after Sidky pasha’s return from London. Two main issues arose in the controversy. The first was whether the Sudan, after having reached the self-governing stage, will have the right to secede from its union with Egypt. The second was whether the present Government of the Sudan, which is supposedly a condominium hut really a British administration, will continue as at present till the Sudanese declare themselves independent. The Egyptians are. not willing to contemplate even eventual separation of the Sudan, since the unity of the Nile Valley is one of the main credos of the national movement. But even granted that the Sudanese have the right of self-determination, the Egyptians argue, there is no justifiable reaaon why the British should continue in possession to enforce that right Behalf of the Suaunese* Their case is that the Egyptian Crown’s, sovereignty in the Sudan which is ’’symBolic' to-day, to quote Mr. Bevin, should Be made real and when the time comes the Sudanese could exorcise the right of self-determination and if they had any grievance against Egypt they could appeal to the United Nations. The Egyptians see in the British reluctance to accept their stand a design to hang on to a part of the Nile Valley. The Governor-General’s speech in Khartoum and the reception given to the Sudanese separatist leader, Sir kb del Rahman A1 Mahdi, in London, contrasted with the refusal to roceive the delegation of the unionist party led By Effendi ,JL i,shari, have confirmed the impression that British policy in the Sudan aims at encouraging the forces of separation. Egyptians, irrespective of party affiliations, united on the issue of Breaking the negotiations with Britain only after these revealinr developments over the Sudan. on The Break-down in the talks, raises a difficult problem for the future relations Between the two countries.. Mr. Bevin has announced that the 1936 Treaty will Be adhered to, as it provides that^if it is not revised at the end of ten years, it is to continue in force. The Egyptians, on the other hand, will appeal to the United Nations for the withdrawal of troops.. Under the Charter, no member of the United Nations can station troops in the territory of another member nation without the lattor^s consent and approval. Egypt as a sovereign nation will obviously withdraw the consent she gave under the 1936 Treaty. Her delegates will ciouBtless also argue that she is not prepared to give a permanent privileged position to Britain in the matter of stationing troops on her territory, as the war emergency which necessitated euch stationing of troops has passed. It is also possible that Egypt will press the point that no new treaty can Be freely negotiated till foreign troops are removed from her soil. In the face of such arguments Britain will find it hard to sustain her-3~ f case fop the continuance of the 1936 Treaty before the ^ United Nations. She will find that the verdict of world opinion will he that she is trying to secure a profitable treaty revision by force. ^nd if the temper of Egyptian nationalism is to be judged by the reports so far available, British policy has succeeded in losing the goodwill and friendship of even moderate Egyptians.INWARD TELEGRAM 700 Allotted to Econcmic Department. 1 194-“7 35*: CQNF.IDSM 1 IAL CODE From To Dated Received Government of India, Commerce Department Secretary of State for India New Delhi, 23.40 hours, 7th February 1947 06.20 hours, 8th February 1947 No.1028 ._ Reference my letter 109(l)-»TR/47 January 17th.

January 27th, 1947 D. 7.17.p.m. J• -L&amp;47. Repeated to Khartoum NO. 31 (Immediate). — oOo MOST IMMEDIATE . Following is text of my statement made in House of Commons this afternoon. [Begins}. I have been informed by the Egyptian Government that they have broken off negotiations for a revision of the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The House will be aware that when the Egyptian Government requested His Majesty's Government to enter into negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, His Majesty's Government, although they were not bound to do so by the terms of the Treaty, willingly acceded to that request. In May last, His Majesty’s Government proposed the with drawal of all British forces from Egypt and to settle by negotiation the stages of the evacuation and arrangements for mutual defence to take the place of those embodied in the 1956 Treaty, at the same time, making it clear that in default of the negotiation of a new treaty, the provisions of the Treaty of 1936 would stand. Negotiations in Cairo proceeded slowly until finally in the middle of October the then Egyptian Prime Minister visited this country in an endeavour to settle the major differences which had hitherto stood in the way of agreement. These differences were concerned, first of all, with the obligations of the respective parties in the event of their being the object of attack or in the event of a threat of war developing in the region of the Middle East; the period within which the withdrawal of British forces and installations from/■MMOUTWARD TELEGRAM - 2 - from Egypt should be completed, and the question of the Sudan. As a result of the conversations which I had with Sidky Pasha, we were able to reach, on a personal basis and subject to the approval of our respective constitutional organs, full agreement on the texts of a treaty of mutual assistance, an evacuation protocol, and a Sudan protocol. Sidky Pasha undertook to recommend the texts to his Government and I undertook, for my part, to recommend them to the Cabinet if they were endorsed and put forward to me officially by Egypt. Of the questions in dispute, by far the most difficult was that of the Sudan. My own position in the matter was that I had given a pledge in this House on March 26th last that no change should be made in the status of the Sudan as a result of treaty revision until the Sudanese had been consulted through constitutional channels. After taking, however, the highest legal advice, I felt that for the sake of an agreement which would have been as much in the interests of the Sudanese as of either of the other parties, I should be justified in alluding in the Sudan Protocol to the existence of a symbolic dynastic union between Egypt and the Sudan, provided always that no change was introduced into the existing system of ad mini stratum whereby the Sudan is administered by the Governor-General under the powers conferred on him by the 1899 Agreements as confirmed and interpreted by the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1956; and provided that no change took place in the arrangements under which the defence of the Sudan is assured. The text agreed upon by Sidky Pasha and myself on the above basis read as follows: 'The policy which the High Contracting Parties under take to follow in the Sudan within the framework of the unity between the Sudan and Egypt under the common Crown of Egypt will have for its essential objectives to assure the well being of the Sudanese, the development of their interests and/OUTWARD TELEGRAM - 3 - and their active preparation for self-government and consequently the exercise of the right to choose the future status of the Sudan. Until the High Contracting Parties can in full common agreement realise this latter objective after consultation with the Sudanese, the Agreement of 1899 will continue and Article 11 of the Treaty of 1936 together with its Annex and paragraphs 14 to 16 of the agreed minute annexed to the same Treaty will remain in force notwithstanding the first Article of the present Treaty'. I would draw particular attention to the right assured to the Sudanese by this text to choose the future status of the Sudan. In the course of our discussions this point came up more than once. I for my part made it clear that nothing must be done, and that I must be able to assure the British people that nothing was being done, to prejudice the right of the Sudanese after they had attained self-government ultimately to exercise their choice - a development which it would take some time to realise. Sidky Pasha subscribed to the view that nothing on paper could prejudice the right of independence nor could it bind a people in search of liberty. This, as His Excellency admitted, was a universal principle, and not a matter for incorporation in a Treaty. I assumed, therefore, and I had good reason to assume, that agreement existed bet : ween us that the Sudanese, when the time came for them to make the choice of their future status, would not be debarred from choosing complete independence, just as they would be free to choose some form of association with Egypt, or even complete union with Egypt. Scarcely, however, had Sidky Pasha left this country than reports appeared, and appeared without contradiction, that His Majesty's G-overnment had conceded the unity of Egypt and/OUTWARD TELEGRAM - 4 - and the Sudan without the ultimate right of self-deteinnination. This publication gave rise to my Right Honourable Friend the Prime Minister’s statement on October 28th, 1946. It was succeeded by other disclosures, and, at later dates, by official utterances, which made it clear that in Egyptian eyes the political evolution of the Sudanese must stop short at self-government under the Egyptian Crown, and that the status of independence for the Sudan was unthinkable. Nokrashi Pasha in fact on assuming office stated in the Chamber of Deputies that ’’when I say unity of Egypt and the Sudan under the Egyptian Crown, I mean a permanent unity . The first effect of these statements was to create a situation of extreme tension in the Sudan, where the numerical^ powerful parties favouring independence accused His Majesty*s Government most bitterly of breaking their pledge and of sell ing them to Egypt. Some rioting took place, but Sir Hubert Huddleston, the Governor General, thanks to his great influence and to the confidence which he inspires in the Sudan, has been able to allay Sudanese anxiety, to restore confidence in the administration, and to persuade the Sudanese independence groups, who had declared a political boycott, again to collaborate with the organs of the Sudan Government instituted to promote the association of the Sudanese with the administra tion, The Governor-General has been the subject of bitter criticism in Egypt, which I deplore and which I regard as unjustified. But this clearly did not by itself go far enough. I could not after what had passed, recommend the Sudan protocol to the Cabinet and to Parliament without securing an agreed interpretation of its terms which would not run counter to what the people of this country regard as the natural order of things/OUTWARD TELEGRAM - 5 - things, viz, that peoples having achieved self-government shall have the ultimate right to self-determination including a right to independence if they want it. I regret that all my efforts have failed to reach anything in the nature of an agreed interpretation whether in the form of an exchange of letters, or of agreed statements to be made by the spokesmen of both sides, or even of agreed statements in which the difference separating the parties would be honestly declared in the hope that it could be composed later, since the question at issue cannot become a live one for at least some years, I offered in addition, if any of these proposals were adopted, myself to make a public statement to reassure Egypt as regards the aims of British policy in the Sudan. I have offered every guarantee for the safeguard of Egyptian interests in the Sudan - for no-one realises more clearly than His Majesty s Government how vital, for instance, is Egyptian interest in the waters of the Nile - I have offered to sign the treaty of mutual assis tance and the evacuation protocol and thus realise one of Egypt’s most eager aspirations - and to discuss the Sudan question d e novo at a conference with ourselves and the Sudanese. To all these proposals I have received either an uncompromising negative or proposals which would involve my re-entering negotiations committed to the thesis that the right of the Sudanese to self-determination must be subject to permanent union between Egypt and the Sudan. I have even found myself accused of pursuing a policy of endeavouring to filch the Sudan from Egypt, % hope is that broader and less stubborn counsels may come to prevail in Cairo, for it is evident that the interests of both countries call for a fresh treaty and would justify a further effort to reach agreement so as to enable the two countries to co-operate for their mutual interest and defence./OUTWARD TELEGRAM - 6 - defence. It is unfortunate that in the negotiations His Majesty* s G-overnment have had to deal with a minority Government. I stated to this House that the question of the Government was a matter for the Egyptians themselves. If, however, we can deal with a more fully representative Egyptian Government and if our negotiations can thereby avoid being the subject of Egyptian party conflicts there will be a much better chance of carrying them through to a successful Conclusion in the right spirit. Meanwhile the Treaty of 1956 will be adhered to. [Ends].

The review was drafted by Mr. Ravensdale, assistant oriental secretary, ALTHOUGH a working agreement had been arrived at between the various parties represented in Ahmed Maher Pasha’s coalition Government with regard to the distribution of seats for the new Chamber of Deputies, the general elections, which took place on the 8th January, did not produce results satisfactory to all the parties concerned. The final returns were :— 2. Makram Ebeid Pasha was indignant that his agreed allotment of fifty-five seats had not materialised, and he attributed this result—no doubt rightly—to Government (i.0., Saadist) intervention against his candidates, some of whom were almost certainly opposed and defeated by Saadists in the guise of Independents. The Constitutional Liberals also made similar complaints, particularly with regard to the second ballots; Heikal Pasha had actually wished to resign from the Government on this account before the elections took place and was only with difficulty dissuaded by King Farouk’s impressing on his Prime Minister that the elections must be free. The most obvious interference of the Government was directed against candidates of the Moslem Brethren and Young Egypt Societies and against some few Independents professing Socialist or Communist views. On the whole the elections were orderly; local conflicts here and there resulted in a few casualties, only one being fatal. The Wafd as a party boycotted the elections, but it is known that Wafdists supported Moslem Brethren and Young Egypt candidates in the few constituencies in which they presented themselves; furthermore, it was reliably reported from several provincial centres that Wafdist participation was observed against particular candidates (no doubt, in most cases, Makramites). In some parts of the country the Coptic issue was raised by Makram Pasha’s opponents, both Saadist and Wafdist, and in view of the trouble caused thereby Ahmed Maher Pasha appealed to Egyptians after the elections not to provoke a Copt-Moslem controversy, an appeal which was thought to be directed as much to Copts as to Moslems owing to Makram Pasha’s manoeuvres to secure political predominance. With these various conflicting forces at work the insecurity of the governmental foundations was apparent to all; the edifice could only be expected to avoid collapse if strongly buttressed by the Palace.

Following the traditional resignation of the Cabinet after the elections, Ahmed Maher Pasha was entrusted with the formation of a new Cabinet. 1 his task presented some difficulty owing to Makram Pasha’s discontent at his electoral failures and at the transfer of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry from a Makramite, who was too ill to function, to a Constitutional Liberal. I he Ministries of Education and Social Affairs also, as the result of Heikal Pasha s ^ acceptance of the Presidency of the Senate, passed from a Liberal to a Saadist. Ahmed Maher Pasha only overcame his initial difficulties in getting a team together as the result of pressure from King Farouk; he even published in his newspaper a statement to the effect that he remained in office at the request of His Majesty. A significant feature of these developments was the increase of Saadist strength in the Cabinet from four to six, while the representation of the other three parties remained as before. At the opening of Parliament on the 18th January the Speech from the Throne, which was unusually long, contained very unflattering and unprecedented references to actions of the Wafdist regime in the matters of supplies, finance, exceptional promotions, &amp;c., and detailed the measures taken by the succeeding Government to remedy an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Reference was made to the new Government’s interest in the Sudan and to Egypt’s contention that her faithful execution of the Anglo-Egyptian Alliance and her contributions to the cause of the Allied nations entitled her to a hearing in the organisation of peace. The Government had some misgivings about the strength of Wafdist representation in the Senate, whose approval of the decree-law redrawing the electoral constituencies was going to be necessary if the general elections were not to be invalidated. Following the nomination of eleven new Senators, however, the election of a Makramite as Vice-President of the Senate by 65 votes against the 55 votes cast in favour of the Wafdist candidate (Sabri Abu Alam Pasha) was regarded as an encouraging sign. 4. Hardly had the new Government got into its stride when it was unexpectedly overtaken by disaster. On the 24th February a secret debate was being held in Parliament to discuss the Government’s proposal that Egypt should declare war in order to qualify for admission to the San Francisco Conference. This proposal had been opposed by the Wafd, whose agitation against it culminated in the issue of a manifesto suggesting that a declaration of war might expose Egypt to huge sacrifices of men and money and generally inflict on her the horrors of war, which she had so far successfully avoided. The atmosphere in which the proposal came up for approval was thus charged with apprehension and hostility, which were by no means confined to Wafdist circles. Immediately after the secret debate in the Chamber of Deputies, Ahmed Maher Pasha was proceeding towards the Senate when he was assassinated by Mahmoud Issawi, an extremist member of the Watanist party who had formerly been interned by the Wafd Government and later released, along with other internees, in pursuance of Ahmed Maher Pasha’s liberal policy. The Wafd, whose propaganda had powerfully contributed to the tension surrounding the late Prime Minister’s death, issued a statement repudiating the crime. Ahmed Maher Pasha was given an imposing State funeral and King Farouk manifested approval of his policy by conferring on him posthumously the Grand Cordon of the Order of Mohammed Ali. Nokrashy Pasha was at once asked by King Farouk to form a Cabinet, and did so without making any changes except that he himself took the portfolio of Interior in addition to that of Foreign Affairs. In accepting this charge Nokrashy Pasha assured His Majesty that he proposed to follow the wise policy of his predecessor and to take firm measures to ensure public security. The secret debates regarding Egypt’s declaration of war in Parliament, resumed two days later, resulted in votes of confidence in the Chamber and in the Senate, the latter’s vote (66 to 41) being noteworthy as indicating a further reduction of the voting power of the Wafdist opposition. With the approval of Parliament the Govern ment published the late Prime Minister’s statement outlining the case for a declaration of war, and it was thus revealed that, while no conditions regarding national aspirations had been proposed, there was a significant suggestion that the Egyptian Government should discuss these aspirations with His Majesty’s Government after the declaration of war and before the San Francisco Conference. 5. Nokrashy Pasha’s succession to the premiership, although accepted as inevitable in view of the Saadist majority in the Chamber, was generally regarded as a misfortune. His susceptibility, despotic nature and pettyfogging mentality were attributes wihch must inevitably prove to be severe handicaps in the handling of his non-Saadist colleagues, and also in the conduct of relations with His Majesty’s Government. Anxieties on the latter score were not diminished when, in March, Nokrashy Pasha selected Abdel Hamid BedawiI Pasha to take over the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, an appointment which was generally ascribed to the importance of having a non-party and technic y qualified ministerial representative to lead the Egyptian delegation at the ban Francisco Conference. Bedawi Pasha and Makram Pasha had always been so violently hostile towards one another that the former s inclusion in the Cabinet accentuated the waywardness of Makram Pasha. The latter s position &gt; anvhow becoming increasingly insecure owing to his recurring di erenc his chief, which arose mainly from old personal antipathies and^were rendere more acute by Makram Pasha’s semi-socialistic wooing of the and his unrelenting insistence on the prosecution o Nahas Pasha and ins Ministers. In April, however, the Palace intervened in favour o , f Pasha's retention m the Cabinet, but induced Makram Pasha to put a check for the time being on his demogogic encouragement of ^ he ^ or ^ ei t S d ^^anTtate result of which had been a serious strike of employees ot the Egyptian btate Railway workshops which was fortunately prevented from spreading to othe narts of the railway system. This temporary appeasement did 0 , • ’ lead to any real reconciliation between these discordant elements, and later in the year the symptoms of disharmony recurred. ns a 6 The general feeling with regard to Nokrashy Pasha s limitations nolitical chief the periodical inactivity of Hassanem Pasha owing to ill-health, and'Tck of emhusiasm for the Wabd,'ought to have ^rmed a avourable com bination of circumstances for the emergence at this juncture or an impres personality capable of directing public opinion and elevating EgypUan pohtmM life to a higher plane. It was in such circumstances that Ah Maher r'asma attempted &amp; return to the political arena by publicising m the is ideas as regards the future organisation of Egyptian political parties and maki &amp; a special 1 appeal tcTthe youthful nationalist elements. The ideas put forward by Ali Maher Pasha at first commanded a good deal of public attention owing widespread feeling that they corresponded with the needs of the hour In a Sena e debate*on martial law in May, Ali Maher Pasha vehemently advocated t^ firm of oublic liberties His Majesty s Ambassador repeated to the Palace ms Nnkrashv Pasha also viewed with serious concern. Ah Maher Pasha conunueu Ws campaigrhowever, and eventually opened a kind of club where he conducted meetings of students and malcontents of divers political colours for political and social discussions. Towards the end of the year Ah Maher Pasha made a further anneal for unity to achieve the national aspirations and also for a nroorammeof administrative and social reform, but the now lukewarm reception bven to his call indicated that he was making little, if any, progress tow aid effective nolitieal leadership. Pleas for national unity as a prerequisite of the assertion P of Egypt’s national claims were also voiced at different \ Abdel Hamid Abdel Hakk, who had severed his connexion with the Wafd in 'January and by Amin Osman Pasha who, in August, launched his League of Awakening ’’ on non-partisan lines to further this object. Although there was evidence that the general idea of political union had numerous adherents among the many who were impatient of dissensions within the Government and party miarrelsknd who desired effective presentation of Egypt s national claims at the peace conference, this ideal had failed to rally a sufficient force of enthusiasts of the right calibre to bring it within the domain of practical politics by the end of the year. ^ ^ of AUied victory in Euro p e approached the climax of realisation demlnds for the modification and even the abolition of etat de siege narticulariv as regards press censorship, became increasingly numerous and insistent ' The late Ahmed Maher Pasha had been sympathetic to gi a&lt; ua relaxation of such restrictions and did, to some extent, alleviate the rigours of the nress censorship. Immediately after the defeat of Germany, Nahas Pasha, in a^oress statement and the Wafdist opposition in the Senate urged the total abolition ofTtot de siege ,but Nokrashy Pasha temporised on the grounds that the international situation was not yet stabilised and that Great Butain st reauired Eaypt’s co-operation in the war against Japan. Nevertheless, the fWrnment conceded a partial abolition in June which the Wafd claimed as a success for itself, and, on the conclusion of hostilities against Japan Nokrashy Pasha madfe a vague promise of complete abolition of etat de siege. Censorship was suspended by decree in September pending the total abolition of de X/ which was finally effected in the following month. A number of decree- laws were then submitted to Parliament maintaining some of the provisions [77—35] B 2 ■4 covered by proclamations made under Hat de siege, particularly those relating to supplies. , 8. Besides asserting the Wafd’s championship of public liberties against the restrictions of Hat de siege, the Wafdist spokesmen and press made a point of urging free elections under a “caretaker” Cabinet, usually exploiting the theme that a fully representative Parliament was an urgent necessity if Egypt’s national aspirations were to be put forward at the opportune time and with due weight.

Uk « ^ i- U*. % 1 / X’ ^ ■»» condemn as reactionary the Government’s policy in the matter of p After the restrictions of Hat de siege had been finally removed, Nahas Pasha, on the anniversary of the “National Struggle” (13th November), made an imprudent reference in a speech to the events of the 4th February, 1942, seeking thereby to rebut charges that he had been an instrument of British policy on that occasion. This apologia opened a series of violent press polemics between the Wafd and the pro-Government organs, and the Palace madte full use of the opportunity to promote the offensive against Nahas Pasha. This campaign naturally provoked anti-British feeling, and was largely responsible, on the admission of the culprit, for the murder in January 1946 of Amin Osman Pasha, accused of being in league with the British in the events of the 4th February, 1942. 9. The main bone of contention between the Wafd and the Government continued to be the question whether or not Nahas Pasha and certain of his Ministers and relations should be prosecuted on charges of corruption and other irregularities. In February the ministerial committee of enquiry set up under Makram Pasha’s chairmanship concluded its investigations. On instructions from the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Ambassador made strong representations to Ahmed Maher Pasha, and also to King Farouk and Hassanein Pasha, against prosecution. The late Ahmed Maher Pasha had seemed not to be keen on prose cution, but the Palace and Makram Pasha undoubtedly were. Mr. Eden, during his visit to Egypt in February, had taken an opportunity to emphasise personally to the Egyptian Prime Minister the deplorable effect which such victimisation would have on the British public and Parliament. Ahmed Maher Pasha stated in Parliament that the Government proposed to submit a Bill for the prosecution of Ministers in accordance with article 68 of the Constitution, but that such a law, if passed, would not be retroactive. (By article 67 of the Constitution ex-Ministers could be tried by special court for infringements of the Penal Code, and the proposed Bill contemplated by article 68 of the Constitution was to provide for cases of responsibility not covered by that code.) When Nokrashy Pasha became Prime Minister he was left in no doubt about His Majesty’s Government’s attitude, but he carefully avoided a definite commitment, his responses being studiously guarded on all the various occasions when the matter was taken up with him by His Majesty’s Embassy either directly or indirectly. The Palace was equally evasive. On the 12th June the Council of Ministers announced its decision to refer the Ministerial Committee’s report to the Chamber of Deputies; although Nokrashy Pasha lunched with His Majesty’s Ambassador on the previous day, he gave no hint that such action was about to be taken. The Cabinet’s decision resulted in the Chamber’s referring the report to a parlia mentary committee; this formality provoked an exchange of abusive recriminations between the pro-Government and pro-Wafd newspapers with regard to the integrity of the former and present regimes, a campaign which poisoned the political atmosphere and, incidentally, demonstrated the low level of indiscipline to which the press was prepared to descend upon the relaxation of press censor ship. For the remainder of the year the report apparently remained in the hands of the parliamentary committee, and no more was heard of the late Ahmed Maher Pasha’s legislative proposal referred to above. 10. On the re-opening of Parliament in November a manoeuvre of Sidky Pasha to gam support for his candidature in the election of the President of the Chamber of Deputies threw into relief the prevailing dissensions between and within the governmental parties. Sidky Pasha intrigued with disgruntled Saadists and Liberals, a few Makramites and a number of Independents. As a result, the Government had to bring considerable pressure to bear in order to secure the re-election of the Saadist candidate, Hamed Gouda. Shortly after wards Hafez Ramadan Pasha resigned from the Cabinet owing to the Watanist pai ty s reluctance to continue being represented in a Government which in their view, had proved incapable of pushing forward the national demands. The Said planned by Nahas Pasha in July gave the Wafd a further5 Watanist party leader refused to be persuaded to withdraw his resignation, despite Nokrashy Pasha’s efforts to get him to do so. The internal discords within the Cabinet were further exposed in early December when Nokrashy and Makram Pashas quarrelled over the question whether the former should proceed to London alone for informal discussions with His Majesty’s Government on the treaty issue or whether an official delegation should be sent for formal treaty revision negotia- gjjions. The dispute was referred to the consultative committee of elder statesmen, who finally decided that an official demand should be addressed to His Majesty’s Government for the opening of negotiations with a view* to treaty revision. This result was clearly a triumph for Makram Pasha, who had skilfully outmanoeuvred his Prime Minister. Before the year closed the Cabinet was further reduced by the resignation of Sheikh Moustapha Abdel Razek Pasha, who became Rector of el Azhar, and there was a prospect that Mahmoud Ghaleb Pasha’s ill-health would shortly cause a vacancy in the Ministry of Public Works. At the same time five Saadist Deputies significantly announced their resignation from the Saadist party, among them Dr. Hamed Mahmoud, a former Minister of Health, who had long been disgruntled owing to' his not having been offered a portfolio in the successive coalition Cabinets. This brought the number of resignations from that party within the year to fifteen. Thus at the end of the year the political atmosphere was most unsettled and, despite a general lack of confidence in the Prime Minister and his coalition, the Palace, unwilling to contemplate any radical change, seemed unable to devise any solution more salutary than a reconstruction of the weakened and depleted Cabinet. It is noteworthy that Egyptian political circles, according to a reliable observer, were baffled by the embassy's complete abstention from intervention in this situation. 11. As had been indicated in Nokrashy Pasha’s letter to King Farouk accepting the premiership, it was a cardinal point of this Government’s policy to safeguard public security. The omens for success looked anything but favour able. The assassination of Ahmed Maher Pasha was symptomatic of a growing disrespect for law and order. Social and economic instability was already imposing a severe strain on the administration as the transition from war to post-war conditions proceeded. In these circumstances, the late Ahmed Maher Pasha’s liberalising tendencies as regards political internment were regarded as premature and after the change from the drastic methods of Nahas Pasha the elements of disorder were not slow to raise their heads again. Following Ahmed Maher Pasha’s assassination, Nokrashy Pasha reversed the process and lost no time in arresting the leading elements of potentially subversive organisations such as the Young Egypt party, the Moslem Brethren Society and the extremist wing of the Watanist party. He also took the precaution of banning the meetings of these societies. His Majesty’s Ambassador repeated to Nokrashy Pasha a warning previously conveyed to his predecessor regarding the infectiousness of political assassination and the advisability of prompt punishment as a deterrent. Lord Killearn also represented to the Prime Minister the value of social reform as an antidote to popular unrest. Nevertheless, manifestations of disorder occurred from time to time throughout the year in various forms—^students’ strikes, surreptitious dissemination of Communist propaganda, a strike in the railway workshops, the explosion of a hand-grenade near Nahas Pasha’s car, the riots which began as anti-Jewish demonstrations on the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration (the 2nd November) and the increase of insecurity in the provinces, especially in Upper Egypt. The traffic in firearms, mostly brought in from the battlefield of the western desert, continued on a large scale which the security authorities seemed powerless to reduce. Not only was there no effective check on the importation of weapons in this irregular way, but the provincial populace was able to defy with impunity the efforts of the authorities to enforce legislative control over the possession of firearms. The task of the authorities in trying to cope with this problem was made all the more difficult by the fact that, whereas these illicit weapons were of the most modern military types, the Egyptian security forces were mostly armed with ancient weapons which were quite unserviceable for the purpose of imposing respect for the law upon well-armed peasantry. This widespread possession of arms is a new and dangerous factor in Anglo-Egyptian relationship, for, in the event of anti-British disorders on an extensive scale, the disorderly elements might be more difficult to handle than in 1919 when they were mainly unarmed. Shooting incidents also occurred in which British soldiers were the victims. The repressive measures taken against the extremist organisations mentioned above had, of course, to be relaxed when martial law ceased to operate. The Government and also the Palace were really more6 perturbed by the activities of Communist sympathise.^ a n^bw of ^hom were arrested at the end of December on charges of dissennnat g , ion that ture; the Government even appeared latterly to have com communism the Moslem Brethren could be of service m combating the tQ The danger of such flirtation with this society had aheady bee p ■ u ^f%hrd'ofVcom?lt“'7ndoubt.&lt;lly stimulated official i„ K ,S und toll.

The 1 ublit authorities who had succeeded 8 with the' help of American experts of the Rockefeller Foundation, in reducing the malaria scourge in Upper Egyp negligible proportions, worked out and partly implemented a number of commend- abfe fchemesX mp oving rural health. The Ministry of Social Affairs was mXupmd above Til will the menace of unemployment resulting from the diSXe of Egyptian workers by the Allied military forces and showed a ready disposition to accept guidance in this and other problems from the Labour Counsellor to His Majesty’s Embassy. The general importance of social ref is an investment for the future was stressed by King Farouk in a speech to h student quests on the 29th July, and again in his Ramadan broadcast to Moslem and Arab nations. On the former of these two occasions His Majesty also launched with substantial monetary donations from himself and other membeis of the roval family a “university city” scheme to provide adequate living conditions 7 and amehities for needy provincial undergraduates studymg m C^ra Tn General however, progress towards the permanent relief °t widespread social dritress in the country was very slow and was certainly not helped forward by Ma ram Pasha s uneconomic semi-socialism to which reference has already been madeTbove Mo'eover. no attempt was made to deal with the fundamental problems onand^tenure^est^ which had been a cont e nt ious issue between the former' Wafd Government and the Palace did not re-emerge as a subject of Dolitioal controversy until some time after the death of Sheikh al Maraghi, T^. 1C occurred in August. The Government, which had set its mind on appointing Sheikh Mustapha Abdel Razek Pasha to the vacant rectorship, introduced legis- laticTto amend certain legal provisions governing appointment R, this offi e in order to clear the way for the nomination of Abdel Kazek ± asna, wno cou not qualify under the existing legislation.

His Majesty’s Government s grant of £2 mil ion tor general development in the Sudan, especially in education and public health, was fnnkpd *it askance in Egyptian circles, some of whom professed to see in it a further sTn of an alleged tendency to assert British imperialist domination over [he Condominium (compare the Egyptian reaction to the creation in 1944 °f an advisorv council for the northern provinces). The unity of the Nile Valley was tViPTnp reneatedlv exploited by Egyptian politicians and press commentators and also by spokesmen of the extremist Egyptian organisations such as the . los em Brethren Society. This particular organisation evinced a strong desire to npnptrate the Sudan by recruiting members among the Sudanese and establishing brashesTere At the end of December the Egyptian Minister of Education was preparing to visit Khartoum for the official inauguration of the new premises of the Egyptian Secondary School established by the Wafd Government. “ 15 Tn the sphere of Anglo-Egyptian relations the late Ahmed Maher Pasha lovallv fulfilled Ids pledge of co-operation in the war effort in accordance with thTlrtter and the 8 spirit of the Xnglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance. The ate Prime Minister had shown his mettle as a friend of Great Britain by dealingvery firmly in Parliament with the intemperance of certain extreme Nationalist speakers who endeavoured to upset our treaty relations with Egypt; his last act was to outline the case for the declaration of war without proposing any ham and fast conditions regarding national aspirations, though suggesting that the declaration might be followed by discussions on this subject with His Majesty s .Government before the San Francisco Conference. To allay the apprehensions of the Egyptian public (which the Wafd had encouraged) regarding the conse quences of Egypt’s declaration of war, a statement was issued to the as from authoritative British sources and on the instructions of the Foreign Office, explaining that this step did not in any way alter the existing situation as regards assistance to be furnished by Egypt in virtue of the Treaty. 1 , , . , 16. Nokrashy Pasha’s attitude towards Great Britain lacked the boldness, clarity and statesmanship which had distinguished that of his predecessor; his demeanour was consistently unresponsive, suspicious and hesitant. In dealing with the subject of Egypt’s national claims he had the advantage of being able to refer to the consultative committee of senior politicians which his predecessor had set up, but it is extremely doubtful whether he was able, or indeed willing, to exert any wholesome influence in the committee’s deliberations. In their celebra tions of the victory over Germany the Egyptian King, Government and peop e laid the usual unblushing emphasis on Egypt’s services to the Allied cause and on Egypt’s right to expect rewards. The Wafd, after our European victory, intensified their clamour for a settlement of Anglo-Egyptian relations on a basis of full Egyptian independence; in July Nahas Pasha addressed a letter to His Majesty’s Ambassador couched in moderate terms, placing special emphasis on the evacuation of foreign troops and on the Sudan question. Nahas 1 asha pointed out that Egypt desired to reach complete agreement with Great Britain before attending a peace conference. At this time, however, it was apparent that both the Palace and the Government were now inclined to stall on the treaty issue, evidence of this tendency was forthcoming in the Government’s evasive reply to a Nationalist senator’s interpellation in early August. These temporising tactics were not, of course, intended as a propitiatory gesture to His Majesty s Govern ment but were clearlv an expedient inspired by fear lest any engagement as regards treaty discussions might involve an eventual return to power oi the Wald. However, on' the 31st August Nokrashy Pasha made oral representations to His Majesty’s Ambassador regarding treaty revision on the eve of Lord Kilieain s departure for London to take part in the Middle East Conference. He urged the complete military evacuation of Egypt and referred to the Sudan but sheered off when warned it was a very thorny subject. The Wafd continuously put forth accusations of inertia against the Government, and insistently demanded the immediate opening of negotiations with His Majesty s Government. Following the defeat of Japan, the consultative committee of eighteen political personalities met again on the 2nd September and decided that the time had now come to open negotiations with Egypt’s ally on the basis of the withdrawal of British troops and the achievement of union of the Sudan with Egypt. King Farouk subse quently declared his approval of this decision at a I alace luncheon to wh ich e invited the whole committee. The announcement of this decision encouraged a number of Egyptian politicians to launch out into nationalist declamations. As discontent with Nokrashy Pasha’s continued reticence on the subject grew m political circles, the student elements, particularly those supporting the Wald, became increasingly vociferous. Makram Pasha went to the length of displaying open resentment by publishing, under a transparent pseudonym, a provocative newspaper article'which was apparently intended to annoy Nokmshy Pasha because the latter failed to keep Makram Pasha informed of what he was do ng about treaty revision. Nor did Makram Pasha conceal his indignation at a suggestion that Nokrashy Pasha might visit London for informal conversations unaccompanied by Makram Pasha himself who claimed a priority right to be associated with any such discussions, or by any other Cabinet Minister As shown in paragraph 10 above, Makram Pasha outmanoeuvred Nokrashy Pasha iu this dispute After the consultative committee had again met and adopted a resolution in favour of presenting an official demand to His Majesty s Govern- ment for the opening of treaty revision negotiations the Cabinet endbrsed this recommendation. The timing of the actual approach to His Majesty s Govern ment through the Egyptian Ambassador in London (Mr Bevin was at that moment absent in Moscow) led to some days’ delay in the submission of the Fs-vntian Government’s note to the Foreign Office; Makram Pasha, in a fit of pique, anticipated this approach by publishing in his newspaper an accurate8 resume of the Egyptian note, whereupon Nokrashy 1 asha instructed A \ to submit the note forthwith. His Majesty’s Ambassador on the mstr of the Foreign Office, suitably took Nokrashy Pasha to task for the breach ot international courtesy committed by Makram Pasha. . . K 17. The foregoing account of Anglo-Egyptian political relations ma} aptly supplemented by a summary of the impressions of the Chiet ol the imperial^ General Staff, who paid a flying visit to Egypt in November. Lord Alanbrookt found Nokrashy Pasha very wooden and insistent that there could be no pai tner- ship between Great Britain and Egypt until all British troops had been with drawn and Egypt had attained her full independence. At Lord Alanbrooke s audience with King Farouk, however, His Majesty was very responsive to the idea of defence on a partnership basis and gave every indication that he would be edad to work towards an agreement of such lines. , 18. An outstanding illustration of Nokrashy Pasha s propensity lor obstructing the path of Anglo-Egyptian co-operation is seen in his attitude towards our proposals for the formation of an Egyptian civil aviation companv with the joint participation of the British Overseas Airways Corporation and the Misr Bank. The function of the projected company was to undertake, on behalf of Egypt, reciprocal air services to foreign countries outside the operating range of Misr Airwork. The Nokrashy Government, while reluctant to bi eak on altogether the negotiations which were energetically pressed from the side were clearly determined to stave off any prospect of early agreement; they obviously regarded our offer as a political matter which should be deferred tor consideration until the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty came up for revision 19. In the sphere of economic affairs problems of mutual concern to Hreat Britain and E°ypt were for the most part handled in a satisfactory spirit ot co-operation. Surpluses of rice, sugar and onions were made available to His Majesty’s Government despite continued shortage of fertilisers, though the sugar surplus was rather disappointing. The “ hard currency ’’ agreement concluded for the calendar year 1945 was loyally operated by the Egyptian authorities, who kept His Majestv’s Embassy well informed of their hard curienc\ expenditure and sought the embassy’s advice generally on the use of those currencies made available to them. They also deferred to the embassy s advice in resisting internal pressure for the abolition of import licensing for goods from the sterling area. There was considerable agitation for a clearer definition of His Majesty’s Government’s proposals for liquidating Egypt s sterling balances and a good deal of criticism of Egypt’s dollar shortage, criticism fomented by disappointed hopes that the Bretton Woods Agreement and An g American financial discussions in Washington would speedily relieve t e situation The Minister of Finance made reassuring statements on several occasions regarding the Egyptian Government’s determination to maintain the link between the Egyptian pound and sterling. , , A ,i 20. The cotton situation began to give cause for serious alarm towards the end of the year consequent upon the Egyptian Government s decision to raise the buying prices by 10 per cent. A strong tendency to blame the cotton policy of His Majestv’s Government was manifest, and eventually His Majesty s Oovern- ment agreed to concede the Egyptian demand for abolition of ^hc Cotton Co-ordinating Committee which co-ordinated purchases for a number ot other Governments as well as for His Majesty’s Government. Complaints were also heard about obstacles, mainly of a monetary nature, to transactions based on the barter of Egyptian cotton for the goods of other countries. Despite British advice the Egyptian Government failed to take steps to restrict cultivation ot the Karnak variety for the 1946 crop, even though over-production of this variety was laro-ely responsible for the prevailing stagnation of the cotton market. 21 / Xenophobic tendencies continued to manifest themselves m commerce and industry, but delaying tactics on the part of His Majesty’s Embassy and the British Chamber of Commerce successfully prevented much progress with the draft companv law designed to restrict the participation of foreign interests m local companies. In October the Minister of Commerce and Industiy unofficially sugo-ested negotiation of a commercial treaty between Egypt and the United Kingdom and the form of such an instrument was still under discussion between the competent departments of His Majesty’s Government at the end of the year, with a view to including suitable safeguards against xenophobic measures. .22. While the value of goods exported to Egypt from the United Kingdom during 1945, as recorded by the Egyptian customs, reached nearly £E. 11 million compared with the pre-war normal of about £E.8 million, no new contracts ofu outstanding importance were being executed by United Kingdom firms during the year, apart from the strengthening of the Esna barrage. However, a num er of large orders were placed in the United Kingdom, notably by the Misr texti e mills and the Egyptian State Railways, although the large railway replacement programme was delayed for parliamentary sanction of the necessary credits. Hopes that the Aswan Dam hydro-electric scheme for manufacture of nitrate would be entrusted to the United Kingdom firms whose combined proposals had ^ long been under consideration were dashed by the Government’s decision to go to open tender. A British consulting engineer was, however, appointed to assist the Egyptian Government in drawing up specifications for this scheme. 23. Animated by the desires to enhance her own international prestige and to assume the leading role in furthering the basic objects of the Arab League Covenant within the framework of a world organisation, Egypt approached the San Francisco Conference with optimistic enthusiasm. The Egyptian Govern ment’s first inclination was to send to San Francisco a large and nominally repre sentative delegation of leading politicians (excluding Waf (lists), but the delegation was finally composed of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Public Liealth and the Egyptian Minister in Washington, with experts and secretariat. Before his departure Bedawi Pasha told the press that he was in agreement with all the Arab delegations to examine with them the proposals that each of them would present to the conference. A series of glowing reports in the local press regarding Egypt’s championship of the rights of the smaller nations sustained the Egyptian public’s high hopes for a time, but the ultimate reaction to the results of the conference was apathetic, owing largely to a feeling that the great Powers had imposed their will on the small Powers. The United Nations Charter was approved by a special session of the Egyptian Parliament in October. 24. The evolution of Arab regional solidarity continued to occupy an important place in Egypt’s conduct of foreign affairs. Having gained the satis faction of securing King Ibn Saud’s adherence to the Alexandria Protocol, the Egyptian Government began preparations to receive representatives of the various Arab countries with a view to the elaboration of the machinery of the Arab League Council. The seemingly capricious visit of King Farouk to King Ibn Saud in January paved the way for the consolidation of the alignment of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the Lebanon against Iraq and Transjordan, which was later to form the nucleus of strong resistance in Arab League circles to the Hashimite scheme for a Greater Syria, and to the Iraqi policy of a closer and more com prehensive Arab union envisaged as a possibility by article 3 of the Alexandria Protocol. Egyptian commentaries emphasised the religious significance of this visit as a demonstration of Islamic solidarity and of the Islamic position of King Farouk. The Syro-Lebanese dispute with France in February produced manifestations of strong Egyptian sympathy for the Levant States, and the visit to Egypt of the Syrian President was made the occasion for further expressions of Egyptian support. This support was effectively manifested a little later in connexion with the hesitation of the “ Big Three ” to invite Syria and the Lebanon to the San Francisco Conference. 25. The proceedings which culminated in the elaboration of the Arab League Covenant were chiefly remarkable for a repetition of the divergencies which had already been apparent in the discussions of the political sub-committee responsible for drafting that instrument. The attempt to form an Arab bloc within the League directed against the Hashimites was an unpropitious beginning for the newly-constituted League. Abdel Rahman Azzam Bey’s appointment as Secretary-General of the League, on which Nokrashy Pasha insisted, w*as unpopular; the non-Egyptian delegates, fearing that the impulsive Azzam Bey was bent on running the show in the Egyptian interest and without statesman like vision, only accepted his nomination a contre-coeur. 26. At tlie inaugural meeting of the Arab League Council in June, King Farouk, in a message to the Council, and Nokrashy Pasha, in his speech, expressed strong condemnation of the harsh measures then being taken by the French in Syria. Various Moslem and pro-Arab organisations in Egypt protested loudly against the French action. Later on the Palestine question again came to the fore, and the Egyptian feeling was intensely stirred by Mr. Truman's pro-Jewish statement in August. Azzam Bey embarked on a propaganda mission to London and intended also to visit Washington afterwards, but was obliged to return to Egypt without fulfilling the second part of his mission. Anti-Zionist agitation in Cairo and Alexandria on the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration [77—35l c10 (2nd November) developed into serious disorders and looting oi s °P S - 10 Palestine question was the principal item on the agenda oi ia Council, which held its second session in Cairo in November. 1 ie ecre j General communicated to the British and United States Governmen s a asking that, in accordance with the late President R( ^ sevelt s .f® s ^ an ^ e ’ ^ c 0 decisions about Palestine should be taken prior to consultation with the Aiahs Attention was drawn to the 1939 White Paper, particularly to the necessity ot Arab consent to Jewish immigration beyond the limits set down in the White 1 Paper. Mr. Bevin’s declaration of the 13th November on Palestine was received cautiously by the Egyptian public and by Arab League circles and King harouk told His Maiesty's Ambassador that he had advised the Arab delegates to accept the proposal for a temporary continuance of Jewish immigration. Nevertheless, Arab opinion rapidlv became less accommodating, doubtless under the influence of a fear of American participation in the Palestine problem. Ihe League s formal reply to Mr. Bevin’s declaration was ambiguous; it apparently amouiJed to a refusal to accept His Majesty's Governments decision, but Azzam ey explained orally to His Majesty's Embassy, and also to the local press, that the reply was not an outright rejection of further immigration. The formulation ot the League’s reply had produced considerable friction between the Iraqi and Egyptian delegates; Nuri Pasha strongly objected to Azzam Bey s inteifeience in the discussions and was, moreover, greatly embittered at his eviction by Egypt from the leading role which he regarded as his right by reason of his long asso ciation with the Arab cause. . . . „ , 27. In the latter part of December costly preparations were in tram tor the expected visit of King Ibn Saud in the following month to return the visit of King Farouk to Saudi Arabia referred to above. 28. For Egypt, as for the rest of the world, 1945 was a year of many difficulties and disappointments attributable for the most part to the war and its immediate aftermath. In the conduct of her own domestic affairs Egypt was handicapped, especially after the late Ahmed Maher Pasha s death, by a lack of impressive leadership and by continual dissensions within the ranks of the Government. The Coalition Cabinet completely failed to establish itself in the confidence of the general public or even to have confidence in itself. It was largely, if not entirely, due to Palace bolstering that it survived at all. King Farouk and his Palace advisers had taken upon themselves a heavy burden of responsibility in summarily dismissing the Wafd Government in 1944 and their burden was made even heavier when His Majesty called upon Nokrashy Pasha to assume the Premership in succession to the late Ahmed Maher Pasha. In the sphere of Anglo-Egyptian relations the omens at the beginning of the year had seemed entirely favourable; Ahmed Maher Pasha never gave cause to doubt the sincerity of his pledge of full co-operation in accordance with the Anglo- Egyptian Treaty. In this respect his death was a misfortune for Great Britain as well as for Egypt, for it is indisputable that, with Nokrashy Pasha in power, Egypt’s relations with His Majesty’s Government were deprived of the satis factory degree of loyalty and frankness on the Egyptian side, of which there had been fair promise so long as Ahmed Maher Pasha was at the helm. Nokrashy Pasha’s suspicious mentality and narrowness of vision made a decline of mutual confidence inevitable. However, in justice to Nokrashy Pasha, he must be given credit for his moderation in pressing for the opening of treaty revision negotia tions in spite of enormous pressure put on him by both the Wafd and governmental elements, and in spite of the delay (generally considered in Egypt as excessive) on our part to respond to the request for negotiations. Moreover, Nokrashy Pasha was, at any rate, in no way actively hostile to Great Britain, however obstructively defensive he might be. Still more, Bedawi Pasha, who exercised a disastrous influence over Nokrashy Pasha, was to a large extent responsible for the latter’s obstructiveness. Happily this state of affairs was counterbalanced to some extent by indications of a growing disposition on the part of King Farouk to appre ciate the expediency of continued and close co-operation with Great Britain in the changing conditions of the post-war world. This disposition was, however, largely nullified by His Majesty’s policy, dictated by Hassanein Pasha, of com peting with the Wafd for popularity by nationalist demagogy. 29. It may generally be said that the year 1945 was characterised mainly by the growth of the demand for treaty revision and the increase of nationalist and extremist agitation, intensified by our apparent lack of response to what was generally regarded as a reasonable demand by Egypt of her ally. Moreover, terrorism again became a prominent factor in Egyptian political life, and it was t * * » % s i ^ i ievident to all before the end of 1945 that the forces of disorder in Egypt were being martialled for a show-dbwn with Great Britain in the event of Egypt s failure to obtain satisfaction. The Wafd, true to its form in opposition, was actively fomenting disorders by violent propaganda against both the Government and Great Britain. The Government, as all anti-Wafd Governments, was inevitably a creature of the Palace and enjoyed little real credit on its own account in the country. The Throne remained the most powerful force in the ^ountry, though not by any means enjoying the support of the majority. Never theless, King Farouk’s policy indicated above has brought the Throne into the dangerous position of a protagonist in a struggle between competing elements of disorder. In this struggle the Palace and the Government have latterly been leaning on the Moslem Brethren, whose strength has increased enormously, and who now are stronger in the university and the schools than the Wafd, whose predominance among the uneducated masses still continues. The Moslem Brethren remain a permanent danger to friendly co-operation between not only Great Britain and Egypt, but between Egypt and Europeans generally. Strengthened by the folly of successive Governments, who have tried to use them, the Moslem Brethren have now openly become a political body and are not hiding their hope that they will eventually replace the Wafd and become the Govern ment of the country. In this struggle of conflicting national elements of disorder, the hand of Communist elements is plainly discernible. It has been impossible to establish direct connexion between Soviet officials in Egypt and the Communist elements, and it is quite possible Egyptian Communists are directed and subsidised by Communist organisations in Beirut, through which the Russians could work more easily without compromising themselves in Egypt.f\ i'J. {p • u(* .

Cairo, \Mh May, 1946. (No. 860.) (Telegraphic.) WEEKLY appreciation. Announcement of His Majesty’s Government’s policy to evacuate Egyptian territory and to leave the Egyptian Government the responsibility for maintain ing the necessary military installations in Egypt in order to implement the alliance in case of emergency was received in a carping spirit by the press, not only the Wafdist but even by the independent Ahram. All these papers main tained that latter part of His Majesty’s Government’s declaration foreshadowed sinister intentions either to make sojourn of British troops in Egypt permanent or to facilitate their return. Subsequently, however, some of the papers including Al Ahram, adopted more favourable attitude, no doubt as a result of prompting by Sidki Pasha. However, Sidki Pasha, in his statement to the Senate on the 8th May, expressed satisfaction with this declaration and at the progress of his discussions with the British delegation. He said that negotiations now had for object the modalities of the time of evacuation as well as the Egyptian Government’s attitude in the matter ensuring co-operation and mutual help in case of an eventual conflict. Egyptian negotiators, he said, would see to it that this was done within cadre of the San Francisco pact. He added that the Egyptian Government had informed the British delegation of its decision to conclude a treaty with the Security Council on basis of article 43 of the pact of the United Nations. Fikri Abaza asked what was the use of a separate military alliance with Great Britain if Egypt was held by similar engagements with the United Nations Organisation. He concluded by urging evacuation without conditions. The first meeting of the two delegations took place the 9th May. After an exchange of formal speeches by the presidents of the two delegations, Lord Stansgate made a statement in amendment to memorandum already put forward by the British delegation to Sidki Pasha regarding procedure of evacuation and assumption by Egypt of responsibility for maintenance of necessary installa tions, &amp;c., to facilitate reception and operation of British reinforcements in the event of emergencies. At the request of the Egyptian delegation a copy of this statement was given to it for study. Egyptian delegation point out that their reply to our above-mentioned memorandum more or less covered Lord Stansgate’s statement. Egyptian delegation therefore urged an early reply to the views it had already expressed. Lord Stansgate had previously explained that we were studying the previous reply to the Egyptian delegation. 2. Prospect of our ‘evacuation has created alarm amongst non-Moslem communities in Egypt as well as amongst some Egyptian elements, who, though afraid to express their views, fear that, after our departure, they may be at the mercy of a dictatorial regime. 3. Azhar, president of the Sudanese delegation and leader of pro-Egyptian party, has issued a statement to the effect that Umma party is no longer repre sented on the Sudanese delegation. Umma delegation have returned to Khartum. 4. On the 5th May, evening, a bomb was thrown outside the Y.M.C.A. and some sixteen British military personnel, including two women, were injured, four dangerously. The bomb was apparently thrown from a passing car. The police have not yet been able to discover the culprits. The Egyptian authorities appear to be making inadequate attempts to run down the murder gang and to prosecute the case against those already accused of participation in the murder of Amin Osman and murderous attempts on Nahas Pasha and British soldiers. Representations on this subject have been made to Sidki Pasha. 5. A hand grenade exploded the 6th May, evening, outside the British barracks at Abbassia and slightly wounded two Egyptian women. No explana tion of this incident has yet been obtained. [77—125]2 6. Senator nominations have resulted in the renomination of twenty out going Senators and ten new ones.

Sidki Pasha renhed refuting Nahas Pasha's criticism of his handling of the Sudanese problem, and the Minister of the Interior, in a separate official statement, rebutted Nahas Pocha’&lt;* allpcrations regarding; the conduct of the Senate ejections. 8. k A communiqul of the Wafd has been published in the press to the effect that the Wafd will meet on the 11th May to examine the political situation in the light of declaration of the British delegation and of the declarations made m the House of Commons and of Sidki Pasha’s statement m Parliament. 9.

Azzam Pasha was evidently out to frighten his British audience, but there is no doubt that, if Sidky Pasha were to resign on the ground that he had failed to obtain from us satisfaction of the Egyptian national aspirations, it would be extremely difficult for any subsequent Prime Minister to maintain order and correct relations with us. (See paragraphs 11 and 12 of the enclosed memorandum.) 3. With reference to paragraphs 9 and 10, Azzam Pasha is quite incorrect in supposing that the British have not the slightest conception of the strength of the new spirit among the youth of the country. It has long been clear to us that the normal Nationalist movement here is being accompanied and intensified by a social and economic revolutionary movement which associates the British EGYPT AND SUDAN.

[77—48]2 with the ruling elements, whose failure, in spite of our persistent representations, to do anything effective in the way of social reform is obviously leading to a situation dangerous to the Throne and the present social order in Egypt. Our difficulty in the Middle Eastern countries is that we have not the power to force their Governments to tread the way of social reform. Unless we are prepared to interfere in the internal affairs of the country in a wholesale way, we cannot possibly bring about the social reforms we would so much wish to see introduced. This position naturally gives great strength to Russian propaganda. The Russians in regions within the Soviet rule have introduced a new economic system which their propaganda represents as a panacea of social evils, and they charge us with maintaining a worn-out capitalist and oppressive system in the countries under our influence but not under our rule. This is the most dangerous factor in our whole situation in the Middle East. I have, &amp;c. RONALD I. CAMPBELL. r^4 ^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THK PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVKHNMHNI 71 WEEKLY appreciation. Lord Stansgate has continued to have informal discussions with Sidki Pasha and King Farouk, which have not been fruitful owing mainly to the inability of Egyptians to take a realist view of the military factors. A meeting of the Egyptian delegation was summoned by Sidki Pasha on the 24th April, and he acquainted them with the progress of these discussions. He has informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Egyptian delegation has approved his attitude of uncompromising insistence on complete ‘' evacuation.’ It is reported that the Egyptian delegates, particularly Makram Ebeid and Ali Maher, are very intransigent and insist on refusal of any substantial British co-operation in peace preparations for war. Egyptian political circles which were inclined to be optimistic are now inclined to be pessimistic. 2. Head of the Moslem Brethren apparently has submitted a petition to His Majesty King Farouk and to spiritual leaders of various political parties, including Nahas Pasha, for unity amongst the various political parties at the present juncture. The Wafd meanwhile continue their extremist tactics with a view to wrecking the treaty negotiations and the present regime. 3. As a result of the Governor-General’s speech to the Advisory Council (see paragraph 4 of my telegram N o. 707) , Sudanese delegation, or at any rate part of it, appears to be going over to the Egyptians. At a reception for the Sudanese delegation by Nokrouri at Saadist, the 19th April, Azhari argued in favour of United Nile Valley under one Crown, and concluded by cheering King Farouk as King of Egypt and the Sudan. This is first time that this attitude has been adopted by the Sudanese delegation (see paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 707). 4. Egypthm political circles and press continue to agitate for Egyptian participation in peace negotiations with Italy. 5. Trial of Amir Osman’s murderer and accomplices began the 20th April. The case, which should have begun in the morning, had to be postponed until the afternoon owing to a daring attempt to seize the dossier case which was being carried by a messenger to the court. The assailant, who jumped out of a car to commit the assault, was apprehended and the dossier recovered. The description of the car coincides with that of the car from which several attempts at assassination of British soldiers were committed. The fact that the time of despatch of the dossier was known would seem to indicate complicities in Cairo with members of the murder gang. The actual murderer, Tewfik Ahmed, contra dicted his confession, which he said he had only made in order to mock the authorities and to secure a good time for himself in prison. The trial has been adjourned until the 26th May. 6. Quarrels between the Wafdist and Moslem Brethren students continue. 7. It is reported that university examinations have been postponed for one month in order to enable students to make up for the time lost by them in political demonstrations. 8. The Cabinet has approved draft law regarding civil aviation agreement between B.O.A.C. and Misr Company. 9. According to a police report, Abdel Hakk has been trying to form a Labour party in Alexandria with Palace support. 10. General Smuts has arrived on his way to London, and has been received by King Farouk and Sidki Pasha. H. Further discussions have taken place in and outside Parliament between Sidki Pasha and Minister of Commerce on the one hand, and recal citrant Deputies on the other, regarding companies’ law (see paragraph 4 of' my telegram No. 667). Sidki Pasha appealed for at least six weeks to produce Government law. For the moment dispute has been settled by reference of Bill to Judicial Committee of the Chamber.

Cairo, Qth May, 1946. I HAVE the honour to refer to Cairo printed despatch No. 77 of the 22nd March, 1946, on the subject of the grant-m-aid of £2 million towards the development of the Sudan recently made by His Britannic Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. 2. I have the further honour to ask your Excellency to accept, and to transmit to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, this expression of the very deep appreciation which the Government and people of the Sudan feel with regard to this generous and encouraging act of the people of Great Britain. The courage and steadfastness of the British nation in the trial of total war now providentially past, and their continued fortitude in facing the grave problems of the present and of the future, have not been without their inspiring effect in this country. And the fact that this gift, which will enable so much to be undertaken directly to improve the lot of the common man in the Sudan, has been made at a time when the people of Britain still face the weary hardships of scarcity and restriction to the full, attaches to it a value of friendship and common interest which has given rise in the Sudan to feelings of very sincere gratitude and admiration. 3. I have further hereby to convey to your Excellency the thanks of the Advisory Council for the Northern Sudan, expressed in the terms of their recent motion the record of which is annexed to this despatch : and I would place on record here my belief that this great gesture of fellow-feeling and willing help made by the British people at such a time will further bind the Sudanese peoples and the subjects of His Britannic Majesty now serving them in confident work together for the common goal—that of informed self-determination for the peoples of the Sudan. THE chairman said he understood that a number of members had asked if it would be in order to propose a vote of thanks to the British Government for their grant of £2 million to the Sudan.

Dr Ali Bedri said he begged to be allowed to propose a vote ot thanks to the British Government for the grant of £2 million which they had announced their intention of making to the Sudan. The Sudanese had followed with interest the lively debate which had recently been conducted in the British House of Commons on the subject. It had enabled them to realise more than ever that British public opinion had recognised the part which the Sudan had played in the war, by providing both men and material for the support of the democratic nations of the world. ^ , i A They were confidently hopeful therefore that this material help would also be accompanied by the more helpful moral support which the Sudanese required m their efforts to achieve before long all their national aspirations. Mekki Effendi Abbas said it gave him great pleasure to second the motion made by his friend Dr. Ali Bedri. He wished to mention how pleased he was at the spirit in which the Members of Parliament, particularly those who were friends of the Sudan, had recognised the services rendered by the Sudan to the Allies.

We had more friends than ever in his recollection both among Hindus and Moslems. India of course would need for 20 years British advisers and guidance as v/ell as assistance in defence and higher technical undertakings. 2. Egypt. He realised that with the abolition of the Caliphate Egypt was leader and nerve centre in the Moslem world including India. There lay [grp.undec. ] value of our offer to evacuate which he said with great emphasis had produced best possible result throughout the whole Moslem world. I asked whether he included Indian Moslems and he said he certainly did. Moreover the effect has been felt also among Hindus, in India, The Moslem world was one from Morocco to [grp.undec. ? Afghanistan] and if we pursued this policy of winning its friendship we should have as our friends a chain of states who valued their independence, [grp.undec.] and including Moslem India. It was not sufficient ^ have British dominions: Britain must have not only children but foster children. We could offer one thing /that~2~ that Russia could not offer, namely, liberty,. We would have a belt of goodv/ill from Tunis to Siam a Returning to the question of Egypt His Highness said that while we must take early [? grp 9 omtd,]s to safeguard her amour propre she must on her side make her proper contribution to the alliance.

Campbell to Mr. Bevin.—(Received 20th April) (No. 707.) (Telegraphic.) \/ WEEKLY appreciation. Lord Stansgate and the British delegation, which arrived on the 15th April, were courteously welcomed by the Egyptian press and public generally, although there were the inevitable statements that Egypt would accept nothing short of evacuation and the unity of the Nile valley. Owing to the illness of Sidki Pasha, who, however, is now better, the delegations cannot meet before the 23rd April. Meanwhile, Lord Stansgate has had informal conversations with Sidki Pasha, anti King Farouk has received the delegation. 2. Pending the opening of official negotiations, the lull in Anglo-Lgyptian political situation continues. Boycott of English in schools and universities has ceased and anti-British agitation there has ceased for the moment. 3. Sudanese delegates continue to be embarrassing to the Egyptian politicians, who are unable to get the delegates to fall in with Egyptian desiderata which amount to a parliamentary and administrative union of Egypt and the Sudan. King Farouk is reported to be particularly annoyed at the refusal of the delegates to make any mention of King Farouk in their speeches. 4. The opening speech of the Governor-General to the Advisory Council has provoked violently hostile reaction among Egyptians, who maintain that, as a representative of condominium Powers, he has no right to make fundamental declarations of policy on behalf of one of those Powers. The Governor-General’s statement that he was confident that in twenty years the Sudan would be govern ing their own country (a statement that has been read as meaning independence in twenty years) has particularly aroused hostile criticism. The General’s speech is regarded as pre-judging negotiations. 5. Press reports further trouble in connexion with senatorial election campaign. A clash occurred in Serag-el-Din’s constituency, with the result that one person is reported to have been killed and two injured. The Wafd has issued a statement alleging that Administration interferes in the electoral campaigns. This has been denied by Ministry of the Interior, but it is generally realised that Sidki Pasha is using his well-known methods to secure the election of as many pro-Government candidates as possible. According to confidential information from the Director-General of Public Security, who is inclined to be pro-Wafdist, the Wafd, in spite of Government manipulation, are likely to secure nearly half senatorial seats up for election and all such seats in Cairo. He asserts that the Wafd are now getting the best of the Muslim Brethren in the villages and are recovering ground in the schools and universities 1 he Muslim Brethren students organised 0 an assault on Wafdist students in Cairo University the 18th April, apparently in revenge for an attack on Muslim Brethren students made by a Wafdist student some days ago. 6. The Wafd continue to lead a violent campaign against Sidki Pasha’s conduct of treaty negotiations and to play to the extremist Nationalist gallery in order to embarrass the Government and Egyptian delegation. 7. Secretariat of the Arab League has issued a statement to the effect that the league is endeavouring to secure independence and unity of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica and to enable their inhabitants to determine the form of government most suited to them. 8. The Egyptian press is beginning to agitate again for Egyptian partici pation in peace negotiations with Italy.

Sudanese delegation is becoming embarrassing to Egyptian politicians, who are furious with statement of policy made by delegation, namely . (1) Condominium Governments to acknowledge establishment of a Sudanese democratic Government free to enter into union with Egypt. (2) This free Sudanese Government to decide the kind of union with Egypt. (3) This free Sudan to enter into an alliance with Great Britain pending The Egyptians have publicly urged Sudanese delegation to modify these demands which it is argued undo all the work of sixty years for union oi Egypt and Sudan. The Egyptians argue that Egypt and Sudan should be one country under one crown. Probably under Egyptian pressure, Ismail Al-Azhan has published a further communique stressing united ideas ot Egyptians ana Sudanese and stating that the three points above detailed are internal matters which concern Egyptians and Sudanese alone, are intended for internal organisa tion of Nile valley, and that they must follow evacuation. 3 There are reports of a dispute in Egyptian treaty delegation particu larly between Sidki Pasha on the one hand, and Makram and Ah Maher on the •other, over demand of Sudanese delegation for representation in treaty nego tiations. Sidki Pasha is also reported to have said that this question is tor Egyptian treaty delegation to consider. The indications are that Sidki Pasha and the present Government are at present reluctant to admit Sudanese repre sentation. Sidki Pasha’s position is none too pleasant vis-a-vis of Egyptian delegation, many of whom are openly or secretly disaffected with him. 4. At the same time Sidki Pasha is having trouble m Parliament. private Bill regarding limited liability companies was introduced b\ a Makramite. The Government asked that this Bill should be withdrawn, as the Government itself was preparing a Bill. There was considerable opposition to this proposal and the Saadists were verv unhelpful to the Government in the debate. An undertaking by Minister of Commerce that he would present the Government Bill in the course of present session met with general opposition, and he finally offered to present the Bill in four weeks. The Chamber, however, adopted a motion to the effect that discussion of this question was adjourned for two weeks. 5. It is evident Sidki Pasha has no party support and that his continuance is dependent solely on the support of King Farouk. , 6. Sidky Pasha has introduced two legislative measures : one, to checK irresoonsible violence of the press, and the other to penalise oral intimidation. The first measure is violently attacked by Wafdist papers as an assault on the freedom of the press hy an arch reactionary. 8. Meanwhile, Sidki Pasha is indisposed ; and has gone to Ismaiha to consult a heart specialist. EGYPT AND SUDAN. April 13, 1946. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. Copy No. 7 1 Sir R. I.

The Copts, being a religious minority, have to try to come to terms with any Nationalist movement in order to avoid 'persecution. The suggestion made b^ Coptic elements, was that title “Moslem Brethren” should be changed to Egyptian Brethren but Hassan Al-Banna was astute enough to realise force of his appeal ivasii) its religious side. He therefore rejected this proposal but has recently ee expressing himself in favour of tolerance towards Christians and Jews.

Sidki Pasha and Government circles have been exceedingly anxious about the apparent delay in the nomination of a British delegation and in our getting to grips with treaty revision negotiations, particularly in view of the agitation being worked up by the Wafd against the Government on the treaty issue, and with a view to provoking demonstrations and disorders on the fortieth day after the death of “martyrs’' of the 21st February. The Prime Minister issued a warning in the press against the efforts of a political party to obstruct the forthcoming negotiations by inciting students and workers to strike and generally to cause disorder. The announcement by the Secretary of State in Parliament of the appointment of the British delegation came as a welcome relief to Sidki Pasha and strengthened his position, which was none too secure, and has naturally given great pleasure to all supporters of the present regime. The Wafd, of course, regard this development with a jaundiced eye. and have been endeavouring to represent our delegation as mainly military, and thus indicating evil inten tions on our part regarding Egyptian claim for evacuation, while the appoint ment of Sir A. Overton is attributed to similar precipitant designs in the economic field. Preliminary talks have already begun between the Prime Minister and His Majesty’s Ambassador, and the' fact that they are being held has been announced in the press. 2. Pro-Egyptian Sudanese delegation is being actively canvassed by Egyptian politicians, particularly of extremist type. It has now been joined by another Sudanese delegation supposed to be more moderate, but likely to become less so in the poisoned atmosphere of Cairo. It seems evident that the Palace is supporting these Sudanese delegations. 3. Mr. Bevin’s statement in the House of Commons on the Egyptian army has been subjected to much criticism by pro-Egyptian Sudanese delegation and by the Egyptian press, notably by Makram Ebeid in his newspaper on grounds that it conflicts with both the Egyptian and Sudanese point of view as well as with 1936 treaty. It is alleged to place Sudan in the category of British colony, while arrangement that Sudan should advance towards self-government and afterwards political independence is held to suggest a complete separation of the Sudanese from Egypt, a solution unacceptable to the Egyptians and the Sudanese 4. ' Uneasiness still exists amongst the public and security continues unsatis factory. Anti-British agitation continues, and there have been two further assaults in Alexandria by unknown assailant against British soldiers, two of whom were wounded. . 5. Boycott of British films still continues, and assurances of the Prime Minister regarding police protection for cinemas do not appear to have yet come to the n ^j nsat - s £ actor y ag p resen t situation is, Sidki Pasha has so far succeeded in preventing disorders and the 4th April passed off without incident. 7. Senatorial electoral campaign is in full swing and all indications are that Sidki Pasha, who is a past master in such matters, is using familiar methods to secure election of Government candidates and to prevent election of the Wafdist ones Alreadv there has been one serious affray in the provinces, where one supporter of the Wafdist candidate was killed and three injured during an electoral tour by him in his constituency.

(Telegraphic.) \ / Si r? ^ Foreign Office, ls£ April, 1946. ’ THE Egyptian Ambassador called on me to-day and expressed disappoint ment that our negotiating team dealing with the Egyptian Treaty had not been announced. He said that the feeling was growing in Egypt that we were, in fact, delaying things in order to undermine Sidky Pasha with a view to creating a situation in which the Wafd would intervene. I told the Ambassador that these suspicions were entirely groundless. I said that you had seen both the King and the Prime Minister for exploratory talks and that we were carefully studying the reports before arriving at our final conclusions. When we did take a decision we expected negotiations to go through with speed and, I hoped, with success. The Ambassador said that the Prime Minister had to meet his Parliament to-morrow and he hoped that I could say something by that date in order to allay anxiety in Egypt and to give some gesture from His Majesty's Government that the negotiations were to be opened in a representative way. I made the tentative reply that reports indicated that their demand was com plete evacuation and I could not see how we could arrive at any decision in which we were a partner in the defence of the Middle East, including Egypt, if their attitude was evacuation and no facilities. The Ambassador told me, 10916—877 [31560—2] 'nH /2 J very privately, that he thought that if we started' negotiations the question of facilities would be met. He also said that there was great feeling over the Sudan, but I said that I had already announced the policy of His Majesty s Government in the House on the question of the Sudan and that must be taken as our view. The Ambassador was very agitated because I could not give him a final decision, but I und'ertook to let him have a further indication of our attitude /“y by 11*30 a.m. on the 2nd April. I meant by this either the date or the names of the team or something definite. I am, &amp;c. ERNEST BEVIN.4 ( 2 ) Mr. Attlee to Mohammed Said Bey, Royal Egyptian Embassy, London.

As stated in the note, it was agreed at the (Moscow Conference in December 1945 that participation in the Paris Conference should be limited to the members of the United Nations which actively waged war with substantial military force against European enemy States. I am mindful of the assurances given to the Egyptian Government in November 1942, and His Majesty s Govern ment would have been glad to see Egypt participate in the conference, but in view of the criterion established in Moscow they are obliged with i egret to recognise that such participation is impossible. , 3. His Majesty’s Government are, however, very conscious of Egypt s interest in the disposal of the Italian colonies, and, as the Government of Egypt are aware from the communication made to them on the 2nd Ootobei, 1945, it was, on my initiative, agreed at the Council of Foreign Ministers in September that the council would consider any views which the Egyptian Government might submit in writing on that question. The views contained in the Egyptian Govern ment’s note of the 12th September are before the deputies of the Foreign Ministers, and will be considered by them along with the written views communicated by other Allied Governments when this particular question comes up for examination. His Majesty’s Government will continue to support Egypt’s claims to be regarded as a State ‘‘ directly concerned ” in the final disposal of the Italian colonies, and if at any time a conference were called to discuss this particular question they would do their best to secure Egypt’s participation. I have, &amp;c. C. R. ATTLEE.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WEEKLY appreciation. Week under review has been one of relative tranquillity and expectation on the part of the Egyptian public, whom Sidki Pasha has tried to keep quiet by suggesting that Anglo-Egyptian Treaty revision negotiations will start immediately after the arrival of the new ambassador. 2. Anti-British agitation, however, continues in university and schools practically uncontrolled by Sidki Pasha, who probably is not averse to continuance of this agitation provided it does not reach the stage of actual disorder. He, no doubt, thinks existence of such agitation may make us more amenable in treaty negotiations. 3. The decline on the Bourse continues in spite of attempts of the Prime Minister to encourage investors. Sidki Pasha has issued a statement to the Bourse Commission to the effect that the exceptional prosperity of the country in no way justifies present collapse and that the Government is going to take suitable action. It is also reported that cinemas and shops are suffering from the general uneasiness of the public as result of recent disorders and bomb incidents. EGYPT AND SUDAN. March 23, 1946. CONFIDENTIAL.

In addition to the roads specified in paragraph 6 (A) above, and for the same purposes, the Egyptian Government will construct and maintain the following roads: — (i) Cairo south along the Nile to Ivena and Kus; (ii) Kus to Kosseir; (iii) Kena to Hurghada. These roads and the bridges thereon will be constructed to satisfy the same standards as those specified in paragraph 6 above. It may not be possible for the construction of the roads referred to in this paragraph to be undertaken at the same time as the roads referred to in paragraph 6 , but they will be constructed as soon as possible. 8 . When, to the satisfaction of both the High Contracting Parties, the accommodation referred to in paragraph 4 is ready (accommodation for the forces retained temporarily at Alexandria in accordance with paragraph 18 below not being included)' and the works referred to in paragraph 6 above (other than the railways referred to in (ii) and (iii) of part (B) of that paragraph) have been completed, then the British forces in paits of Egjpt other than the areas in the Canal Zone specified in paragraph 2 above and except for those maintained temporarily at Alexandria, will withdraw and the lands, barracks, aircraft landing grounds, seaplane anchorages and accommodation occupied by them will be vacated and, save in so far as they may belong to private persons, be handed over to the Egyptian Government. 9. Any difference of opinion between the two Governments relating to the execution of paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7 and 8 above will be submitted to the decision of an Arbitral Board, composed of three members, the two Governments nominating each a member and the third being nominated by the two Governments in common agreement. The decision of the Board shall be final. 10. In order to ensure the proper training of British troops, it is agreed that the area defined below will be available for the training of British forces: (a) and (b) at all times of the year, and (c) during February and March for annual manoeuvres: — (a) West of the Canal: From Kantara in the north to the Suez-Cairo railway (inclusive) in the south and as far as longitude 31 degrees 30 minutes east, exclusive of all cultivation; (b) East of the Canal as required; (c) A continuation of (a) as far south as latitude 29 degrees 52 minutes north, thence south-east to the junction of latitude 29 degrees 30 minutes north and longitude 31 degrees 44 minutes east and from that point eastwards along latitude 29 degrees 30 minutes north. The areas of the localities referred to above are included in the map (scale 1: 500,000) which is annexed to the present Treaty.( 2 ) ( x ) See note No. 1 on page 20. ( 2 ) Not reproduced. y9 11. Unless the two Governments agree to the contrary, the Egyptian Government will prohibit the passage of aircraft over the territories situated on either side of the Suez Canal and within 20 kilometres of it, except for the purpose of passage from east to west or vice versa by means of a corridor 10 kilometres wide at Kantara. This prohibition will not, however, apply to the forces of the High Contracting Parties or to genuinely Egyptian air organisations or to air organisations genuinely belonging to any part of the British Commonwealth of Nations operating under the authority of the Egyptian Government. The Egyptian Government will provide when necessary reasonable m&gt;Wns of communication and access to and from the localities where the British forces are situated and will also accord facilities at Port Said and Suez for the landing and storage of material and supplies for the British forces, including the maintenance of a small detachment of the British forces in these ports to handle and guard this material and these supplies in transit. 13. In view of the fact that the speed and range of modern aircraft necessitate the use of wide areas for the efficient training of air forces, the Egyptian Government will accord permission to the British air forces to fly wherever they consider it necessary for the purpose of training. Reciprocal treatment will be accorded to Egyptian air forces in British territories. 14 In view of the fact that the safety of flying is dependent upon provision of a large number of places where aircraft can alight, the Egyptian Government will secure the maintenance and constant availability of adequate landing grounds and seaplane anchorages in Egyptian territory and waters. The Egyptian Government will accede to any request from the British air forces for such additional landing grounds and seaplane anchorages as experience may show to be necessary to make the number adequate for allied requirements. 15. The Egyptian Government will accord permission for the British air forces to use the said landing grounds and seaplane anchorages, and in the case of certain of them to send stocks of fuel and stores thereto, to be kept in sheds to be erected thereon for this purpose, and in case of urgency to undertake such work as may be necessary for the safety of aircraft. 16. The Egyptian Government will give all necessary facilities for the passage of the personnel of the British forces, aircraft and stores to and from the said landing grounds and seaplane anchorages. Similar facilities will be afforded to the personnel, aircraft and stores of the Egyptian forces at the air bases of the British forces. 17. The British military authorities shall be at liberty to request permission from the Egyptian Government to send parties of officers in civilian clothes to the Western Desert to study the ground and draw up tactical schemes. This permission shall not be unreasonably withheld. 18. His Majesty the King of Egypt authorises His Majesty The King and Emperor to maintain units of his forces at or near Alexandria for a period not exceeding eight years from the date of the coming into force of the present treaty, this being the approximate period considered necessary by the two High Contracting Parties— (а) For the final completion of the barrack accommodation in the Canal zone; ( б ) ( 3 ) For the improvement of the roads— (i) Cairo-Suez; (ii) Cairo-AIexandria via Giza and the desert; (iii) Alexandria-Mersa Matruh; so as to bring them up to the standard specified in part (A) of paragraph 6 ; (c) The improvement of the railway facilities between Ismailia and Alexandria, and Alexandria and Mersa Matruh referred to in (ii) and (iii) of part (B) of paragraph 6 .

Article 9. The immunities and privileges in jurisdictional and fiscal matters to be enjoyed by the forces of His Majesty The King and Emperor who are in Egypt in accordance with the prov.sions of the present treaty will be determined in a separate convention to be concluded between the Egyptian Government and His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom.

The Governor-General shall continue to exercise on the joint behalf of the High Contracting Parties the powers conferred upon him by the said agreements. , . , • The High Contracting Parties agree that the primary aim ot their administration in the Sudan must be the welfare of the Sudanese.

In addition to Sudanese troops, both British and Egyptian troops shall be placed at the disposal of the Governor-General for the defence of the Sudan. _ 4. Egyptian immigration into the Sudan shall be unrestricted except for reasons of public order and health. ( 4 ) Treaty Series No. 29 (1929) (Cmd. 3410). ( 5 ) See note No. 3 on page 21.11 5. There shall be no discrimination in the Sudan between British subjects and Egyptian nationals in matters of commerce, immigration or the possession of property. 6 . The High Contracting Parties are agreed on the provisions set out in the Annex to this Article as regards the method by which international conventions are to be made applicable to the Sudan. Annex to Article 11 . 1 . Unless and until the High Contracting Parties agree to the contrary in application of paragraph 1 of this Article, the general principle for the future shall be that international conventions shall only become applicable to the Sudan by the joint action of the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Egypt, and that such joint action shall similarly also be required if it is desired to terminate the participation of the Sudan in an international convention which already applies to this territory. 2. Conventions to which it will be desired that the Sudan should be a party will generally be conventions of a technical or humanitarian character. Such conventions almost invariably contain a provision for subsequent accession, and in such cases this method of making the convention applicable to the Sudan will be adopted. Accession will be effected by a joint instru ment, signed on behalf of Egypt and the United Kingdom respectively by two persons duly authorised for the purpose. The method of depositing the instruments of accession will be the subject of agreement in each case between the two Governments. In the event of its being desired to apply to the Sudan a convention which does not contain an accession clause, the method by which this should be effected will be the subject of consultation and agreement between the two Governments. 3. If the Sudan is already a party to a convention, and it is desired to terminate the participation of the Sudan therein, the necessary notice of termination will be given jointly by the United Kingdom and by Egypt. 4. It is understood that the participation of the Sudan in a convention and the termination of such participation can only be effected by joint action specifically taken in respect of the Sudan, and does not follow merely from the fact that the United Kingdom and Egypt are both parties to a convention or have both denounced a convention 5. At international conferences where such conventions are negotiated, the Egyptian and the United Kingdom delegates would naturally keep in touch with a view to any action which they may agree to be desirable in the interests of the Sudan. Article 12. His Majesty The King and Emperor recognises that the responsi bility for the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolves exclusively upon the Egyptian Government, who will ensure the fulfilment of their obligations in this respect. Article IB. His Majesty The King and Emperor recognises that the capitula tory regime now existing in Egypt is no longer in accordance with the spirit of the times and with the present state of Egypt.12 His Majesty the King of Egypt desires the abolition of this regime without delay. Both High Contracting Parties are agreed upon the arrangements with regard to this matter as set forth in the Annex to this Article. Annex to Article 13. 1. It is the object of the arrangements set out in this Annex: — (i) To bring about speedily the abolition of the Capitulations in with the disappearance of the existing restrictions on Egyptian sovereignty in the matter of the application of Egyptian legislation (including financial legislation) to foreigners as its necessary consequence; ,. , . , . (ii) To institute a transitional regime for a reasonable and not unduly prolonged period to be fixed, during which the Mixed Tribunals will remain and will, in addition to their present judicial jurisdiction, exercise the jurisdiction at present vested in the Consular Courts. At the end of this transitional period the Egyptian Government will be free to dispense with the Mixed Tribunals. 2. As a first step, the Egyptian Government will approach the Capitulatory Powers as soon as possible with a view to (a) the removal of all restrictions on the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners, and (b) the institution of a transitional regime for the Mixed Tribunals as provided in paragraph 1 (ii) above. 3. His Majesty’s Government in the Tnited Kingdom, as tl\e Government of a Capitulatory Power and as an ally of Egypt, are in no way opposed to the arrangements referred to in the preceding paragraph and will collaborate actively with the Egyptian Government in giving effect to them by using all their influence with the Powers exercising capitulatory rights in Egypt. 4. It is understood that in the event of its being found impossible to bring into effect the arrangements referred to in paragraph 2, the Egyptian Government retains its full rights unimpaired with regard to the capitulatory regime, including the Mixed Tribunals. 5. It is understood that paragraph 2 (a) involves not merely that the assent of the Capitulatory Powers will be no longer necessary for the application of any Egyptian legislation to their nationals, but also that the present legislative functions of the Mixed Tribunals as regards the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners will terminate. It would follow from this that the Mixed Tribunals in their judicial capacity would no longer have to pronounce upon the validity of the application to foreigners of an Egyptian law or decree which has been applied to foreigners by the Egyptian Parliament or Government, as the case may be. 6 . His Majesty the King of Egypt hereby declares that no Egyptian legislation made applicable to foreigners will be inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislation or, with particular relation to legislation of a fiscal nature, discriminate against foreigners, including foreign corporate bodies. 7. In view of the fact that it is the practice in most countries to apply to foreigners the law of their nationality in matters of “ statut personnel,” consideration will be given to the desirability of excepting from the transfer of jurisdiction, at any rate in the first place, matters relating to “statut personnel ” affecting nationals of those Capitulatory Powers who wish that their Consular authorities should continue to exercise such jurisdiction. 8 . The transitional regime for the Mixed Tribunals and the transfer to them of the jurisdiction at present exercised by the Consular Courts (which regime and transfer will, of course, be subject to the provisions of the special convention referred to in Article 9) will necessitate the revision of existing laws relating to the organisation and jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals,including the p re P arat i° n aa d promulgation of a new Code of Criminal Procedure. It is understood that this revision will include amongst other matters: -— (i) (ii) The definition of the word “ foreigner ” for the purpose of the future jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals; The increase of the personnel of the Mixed Tribunals and the Mixed Parquet, which will be necessitated by the proposed extension of their jurisdiction; The procedure in the case of pardons or remissions of sentences imposed on foreigners and also in connection with the execution of capital sentences passed on foreigners. Article 14. The present treaty abrogates any existing agreements or other instruments whose continued existence is inconsistent with its provisions. Should either High Contracting Party so request, a list of the agreements and instruments thus abrogated shall be drawn up in agreement between them within six months of the coming into force of the present treaty. Article 15. The High Contracting Parties agree that any difference on the subject of the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present treaty which they are unable to settle by direct negotiation shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Article 36. At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty years from the coming into force of the treaty, the High Contracting Parties will, at the request of either of them, enter into negotiations wdth a view to such revision of its terms by agreement between them as may be appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist. In case of the High Contracting Parties being unable to agree upon the terms of the revised treaty, the difference will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for decision in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant in force at the time of signature of the present treaty or to such other person or body of persons for decision in accordance with such procedure as the Pligh Contracting Parties may agree. It is agreed that any revision of this treaty will provide for the continuation of the Alliance between the High Contracting Parties in accordance with the principles contained in Articles 4 , 5 , 6 and 7. Nevertheless, with the consent of both High Contracting Parties, negotiations may be entered into at any time after the expiration of a period of ten years after the coming into force of the treaty, with a view to such revision as aforesaid.14 Article 17. The present treaty is subject to ratification. Ratifications shall be exchanged in Cairo as soon as possible. The treaty shall come into force on the date of the exchange of ratifications, and shall thereupon be registered with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.

Sir, With reference to Article 12 of the treaty signed this day, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Egyptian Government intend to abolish forthwith the European Bureau of the Public Security Department, but will retain, for five years from the coming into force of the treaty, a certain European element in their city police. The said police will remain for the same period under the command of British officers. With a view to facilitating the gradual substitution of Egyptian officials for the said European element and thereby securing the harmonious working of the police organisation, the Egyptian Govern ment propose to dispense annually with the services of one-fifth of the number of European police officials. The Egyptian Government, in view of the treaty of friendship and alliance signed to-day, will, when engaging the services of foreign experts, generally prefer British subjects possessing the necessary qualifications.

Sir, I wish to place on record certain further understandings in regard to military matters which have been reached between us in connexion • the Treaty of Alliance signed this day. ( 1 ) British personnel shall be withdrawn from the Egyptian Army and the functions of the Inspector-General and his staff shall terminate. ( 2 ) The Egyptian Government, desiring to perfect the training of the Egyptian Army including the Air Force, and intending, in the interests of the alliance which has been established, that such foreign instructors as they may deem necessary shall be chosen from amongst British subjects only, will avail themselves of the advice of a British Military Mission for such time as they may deem necessary for the purposes aforesaid. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will furnish the Military Mission which the Egyptian Government desire, and will also undertake to receive and provide proper training in the United Kingdom for any personnel of the Egyptian forces which the Egyptian Government may desire to send for the purpose of being trained. In the circumstances created by this treaty the Egyptian Government will naturally not desire to send any personnel of their armed forces to undergo a course in any training establishment or unit abroad elsewhere than in the United Kingdom, provided that this shall not prevent it from sending to any other country such personnel as cannot be received in training establishments and units in the United Kingdom. (3) In the interests of the Alliance, and in view of the possible necessity of co-operative action between the British and Egyptian forces, the armament and equipment, land and air, of the Egyptian forces shall not differ in type from those of the British forces. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom undertake to use their good offices to facilitate the supply of such armament and equipment from the United Kingdom, at prices similar to those which would be paid by His Majesty’s Government, whenever the Egyptian Govern ment so desire.

Reference my telegram of the 29th Hay CircularNo,.96. The following message is for the Prime Minister . the President of Executive C ounci1. Begins:- Although the Prime Minister of Egypt informed His Majesty's High Commissioner in Cairo that the latest proposals of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could not be accepted by him since they involved a limitation on the Egyptian sovereignty to which no Egyptian Government could subscribe, he has orally, and once in writing, several times offered a perpetual treaty of alliance. It has been further explained by Nahas Pasha that under this offer His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could, by reason of the provisions of Article G, which he regarded as permanent, send British troops to the Canal at any time with no limit whatever in an 'apprehended emergencjr” as well as in the event of war or imminent menace of war. This would be so even if British troops stationed in the Canal zone had left. This has introduced into the situation an entirely new element, which is clearly of fundamental importance. In the opinion of the Government of the United Kingdom, if this principle is incorporated in the treaty it will render it unnecessary to insist upon their original proposals; for (as Nahas Pasha himself has stated in writing) British co-operation liIIlosure in air mail letter no. 68 1 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT.

The principle in question in ' the considered opinion of the United Kingdom GoYernment thus enables them to accept (with modifications entailed both by the new proposal and by the increased numbers and facilities in the Canal zone which have already been partly agreed to by Egyptian delegates) the military articles agreed in 1930 with the Egyptian Government. If this is done the prospects of securing a treaty are materially improved. It is thought by the United Kingdom Government that, in view of the general international situation and of prevailing conditions in the Eastern iiediterranean, it is highly important to secure a treaty (if one can be agreed on terms consistent with British interest in general) as rapidly as possible* Ply immediately following telegram gives the te r.ts of the military articles as approved by the Government of the United Kingdom. Sir II.Lampson, who arrived at Cairo on June 30th on his return from this country, has accordingly been authorised to resume conversations with the Government of Egypt on the basis of those texts. Lie as age ends*J t.i \the King of Egypt in the event of war* imminent menace of war or apprehended emergency s will consist in furnishing to His Majesty the King and Emperor on Egyptian territory, in accordance with the Egyptian system of administration and legislation* all the facilities and assistance in his power { including the use of his ports* aerodromes and means of communication.

They considered,however, that His Majesty’s High Commissioner should explain clearly to Sahas Pasha in the ciscussions that the meaning attached by His Majostjr’s Government to these texts and to the clauses in which they would be included in a treaty is (i) that HisMajesty* s Government cannot hand over the right to a third party to say at the end of twenty years whether they are entitled to defend the Suez Canal or not, but only a decision on the question of how many British troops are required for this purpose and where they are to be placed; (ii) that the British forces to be kept in the Canal after twenty years cannot be reduced to a 'token” force but must be substantial in number: in other words that the reference to number of troops must not be read as though it were 'the number of troops if any”, and that the only question that the Council of the League if appealed to v*ould have to decide would be what the substantial number of British troops was to be and where they were to be situated. It may ultimately be necessary to include this explanation in a procds.-.Yer.b&amp;l before the signature of the treaty. 2. His Majesty's High Commissioner has aiso been instructed to explain to Hahas i?asha that it is necessary to provide for the right of His Majesty the King and Emperor to protect the Canal within the meaning of Article 9 of the Canal Convention, a right that most other Powers have already recognised. Should Hahas Pasha then propose that Egypt sbaAd merely recognise that His Majesty has the position of Turkey in that Article (as did the parties to Article 152 of the Treaty of Versailles), it will have to be explained that this is not enough, as His Majesty’s Government must have the right for the purposes of the protection of the Canal to act independently and not merely at the request of Egypt. 3 * Sir M. Lamp a on is also to make plain once again that the concessions that His Majesty’ e Government are prepared to make in respect of the evacuation of the Cairo area can only be made in order to obtain a treaty as a whole (alternativewording: 'are dependent on agreement on all points”). He is also to take an opportunity of reaffirming the understanding hy v/hich no detailed information should he giyen out until the discussions or the eventual treaty negotiations have either been completed or have failed. 4. Text in paragraph 3 of my immediately preceding telegram takes place of Article 14 of 1930 draft and leaves Article 15 of 1930 draft completely unaffected. It involves suppression of paragraph 2 of Article 9 of 1930 draft, which Article will now be on lines of text in paragraph numbered 4 of ny telegram just referred to.

Question of future Location of the British Forces in Egypt. MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. A copy is attached of a telegram sent to the Government of India on 21st April asking for their views on the proposals in the Foreign Office letter of 13th April, No. J. 925/G., and of the Government of India’s reply of 27th April. It will be seen that the Government of India deprecate the complete withdrawal of the British forces from the vicinity of Cairo to the east^line 32 degrees, unless His Majesty’s Government find that no treaty can be negotiated on any other basis. For my own part, I fully recognise the desirability of a treaty settlement with Egypt, as I presume that it may become more and more difficult to resist her claim to be admitted to the League of Nations, and once she became a member of the League it is difficult to see how, except on the basis of a treaty, we could justify the presence of British troops in Egypt at all. Moreover, His Majesty’s present Government seems to have an opportunity, which may not recur, of securing a not unsatisfactory treaty settlement, especially now that the Egyptian Government, backed by King Fuad, is favourably disposed towards us. On the other hand, though I am not convinced that it would not be possible, in the last resort, to defend the Canal from the Canal zone, I realise that this task would be made much more difficult by the removal of our troops from Cairo. When I was a member of the C.I.D. Committee that considered this question in 1927, it seemed to me that the most difficult problem was that of the water supply of the troops. If this water supply can be ensured, I should be inclined to agree to the withdrawal from Cairo, provided that it can be shown that such a step is really essential to the prospect of obtaining a treaty. The Foreign Office will no doubt recognise the need for extreme caution in the preliminary discussions, and the necessity of obtaining as many safeguards as are possible. 1 would suggest that, while we should, in the last resort, refrain from sacrificing the chances of a treaty upon the question of the Cairo garrison, our representatives should be instructed, in entering into any preliminary discussions that may be sanctioned, to bear prominently in mind the advantages o*f retaining our troops in their present locations, and, if this should prove to be impracticable, of trying to secure the largest possible zone as a pis alter. In view of the grave issues that are involved and of the vital interest that is taken in them by the Service Departments, the India Office and the Dominions, I consider that the negotiations should take place in London. India Office, S. H. 4 th May 1933. Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, Foreign and Political Departinent, dated 21s£ April 1933. 989. Most secret. Walton’s personal letter to Metcalfe, dated 3rd November PZ. 6031/32. Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations. 2. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposes very shortly to submit proposals to Cabinet for initiation of preliminary discussions in Cairo between His Majesty’s High Commissioner and Egyptian Prime Minister, with a view to resumption of negotiations. 3. Discussions would turn on two most important points at issue, viz. :— (а) Future location of British forces in Egypt; and (б) Future administration of Sudan. 1859 60 5.334. As regards (a), it is Intended to secure if possible following important modifi cations of terms offered in 1930 (Command Paper 3575;:— (1) Transfer of land and air forces to Suez Canal zone would be to locations chosen by them—main concentration of land forces being on west side of Great Bitter Lake, and of air forces in neighbourhood of Ismailia. (2) Absolute freedom of movement of British Service aircraft. t3) Egypt’s assistance as an ally to be available, not merely in time of war, but in the wide range of contingencies covered by following definition : “ In the event of imminent menace of war or of serious disturbance within the territories under the sovereignty or authority of His Britannic Majesty, or territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of a threat to His Britannic Majesty’s essential communi cations.” (4) No restriction on number of land and air forces to be maintained in contingencies contemplated in (3) above. (5) No provision for Egyptian troops on the Canal. (0) Definition in separate convention of privileges and immunities for British forces in Egypt. 5. As regards (?;), intention is to maintain and even to strengthen relevant article of 1930 Draft, which secures in effect that future administration of Sudan shall be in British hands, with Egypt as sleeping partner. Following concessions are, however, proposed, with a view to encouraging Egypt to continue present financial subvention :— (1) Periodic meetings of Nile Commission with powers of recommendation on all major issues affecting Nile waters. (2) Acceptance of Egyptian Agent at Khartoum with status and functions corresponding to those of Sudan Agent in Cairo. 6. No decision has yet been reached on these proposals, and Service Departments are still reluctant to agree to removal of troops from the cities or their suburbs, but it is hoped that Cabinet decision may be reached before end of April, so that High Commissioner may be instructed before his return to Cairo, and I shall be glad of very early expression of your views. 7. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers that failure to respond to long- continued Egyptian pressure for resumption of negotiations must result in virtual abandonment of policy outlined in Declaration of 1922, and would entail risk of nationalist movement in Egypt similar to that of immediate post-war period, and that arguments for delay, although cogent, have already been developed to fullest degree which is either reasonable or safe.

Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations. 2. From our point of view essential object to be secured is free passage for British shipping through the Canal in all circumstances both in peace and war. This can only be secured if the Canal is protected from all possibility of successful hostile action, and such protection must, we consider, be afforded for indefinite period by British troops and Royal Air Force. We are assured by our military advisers that complete withdrawal from vicinity of Cairo to east of line 32 degrees would create a position strategically unsound and one from which protection of the Canal zone would not be effective in spite of the safeguards now proposed, and we are unable, therefore, to recommend that this should be agreed to unless His Majesty’s Govern ment find that no treaty can be negotiated on any other basis. 3. Apart from this, we welcome changes now proposed in the draft Treaty as explained in paragraph 4 (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of your telegram. '4.

For my own part, I fully recognise the desirability of a treaty settlement with Egypt, as I presume that it may become more and more difficult to resist her claim to be admitted to the League of Nations, and once she became a member of the League, it is difficult to see how, except on the basis of a treaty, we could justify the presence of British * troops in Egypt at all. - Moreover, H.M.*8 present Govt, has an axeaptionallygoed opportunity, which may not recur, of securing a so 1401 5000 11.32Id treaty settlement wi'th-Sgypt, especially now that the Egyptian Govt., backed by King Fuad, is favourably disposed towards us.

Ky own view is that it would from almost every point of view be preferable to retain the ga,rrison in or in the neighbourhood of Cairo. Ifhen, however, I was a member of the C.I.D. Committee that considered the question in the last Conservative Government, I was never convinced that the Canal could not in the last resort ce defended fr an the Canal zone, though I realised that the task would be made much more difficult by the removal of the troops from Cairo. The most difficult problem seemed to me to be not so much she defence of the Canal as the water supply of the troops. If the water supply can be ensured, I should, I think, be inclined to agree to the withdrawal from Cairo, if it is really essential to a treaty. I gather that this is also the view of the Government of India. This atti tude does hot, however, preclude us from pressing upon the Foreign Office the advantages of Cairo and of trying to get the biggest possible zone if we can not stop in Cairo, I feel that it is very difficult to sit tight and do nothing. It almost any moment we may see Egypt, stimulated by the example of Iraq and possibly encouraged by the Italians, clamouring for a seat on the League of Nations. It will be more and more difficult for us to resist Egypt’s claim andif once the claim is admitted, I do not see how without a treaty we can justify the presence of British troops in Egypt at all. Moreover, it does not seem to me likely that we shall get again the continuation o- me favourable con ditions. that now seem to exist, namely a cautious Government here hacked hy a hig majority, and an Egyptian Government, hacked hy King Euad, that is favourably disposed towards us. On these grounds I suggest that we should instil upon the Foreign Office the need for extreme caution and the need for retaining as many safeguards a.s are possible, out that we should in the last resort refrain from sacrificing the chances of a treaty upon the question o^ the ^aiio ga- rison. It might he well to prepare a paper on these lines and to circulate it to the Chiefs of the Staff and the C.I.D. oo whom the question has heen referred.C' 'K . C: ^ frA UJ'P ; Minute Paper. P.z. 2»n 33 Department. U. S- S, r-s. l r The question of the location of the British forces to be stationed in Egypt for the defence of the Suez Canal has been one of the stumbling blocks in all the recent negotiations. The draft treaty agreed upon by Sir A. Chamberlain and Sarwat Pasha in 1927 provided for the maintenance upon Egyptian territory (without restriction of place) of such armed forces as H.ILG. considered necessary for the purpose of protecting the lines of conasrunicat ion of the British Empire; the question of the location of these forces was to be reconsidered (and, if necessary, submitted to the Council of the League of Nations) at the end of ten years. One of the reasons why the Egyptian Govt, refused to accept this draft treaty on Sarwat’s return to Egypt was 'that it legalises occupation of the country by British forces'. In 1929 the draft proposed by Mr. Henderson to Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha provided for the maintenance upon Egyptian territory, in localities to be agreed usqil.UL. thfc. pact nf Wptnrift 32° E .. of such forces as H.B.M. considered necessary for the purpose of protecting the Suez Canal. After the difficult negotiations of 1930 in London, the draft finally agreed upon with Nahas Pasha provided that, until such time as the H.C.Po. agreed that the Egyptian army was able to protect the Canal, H.B.M. might station near Isma jlia forces not exceeding a certain number, and that the R.A.F. depot should be transferred from Aboukir to Port Fuad; at the end of 20 / 1212 5000 0/32Minute Paper, Department. 1212 5000 0/32 20 years the question whether the Egyptian army was able to take over the defence of the Canal was, failing agreement, to be submitted to the League of Nations. It will be seen that what is now contemplated in the F.O. letter is a return to the British proposals of 1929, with the proviso that we shall select the exact localities east of lo^jitude 32° E. Gen. Wigram, who was present at the negotiations of 1930, hoped that the terms of the 1929 draft as he considered these to represent the extreme limit which the G. cf I. could be expected to accept; during the negotiations the Egyptians proposed that the British forces should be relegated to the east of the Canal, a proposal which Gen. Wigram, of course, strongly deprecated. Gen. Wigram*scomments were passed on by Mr. Benn to Mr. Henderson* yis stated above, the draft finally agreed on in 1950 provided for the location of the British forces near Israailia (not anywhere east of lokjitude 32° E.). The G. of I.'s present telegram suggests that withdrawal from Cairo to selected places east of Itnjitude 32° E. is not good enough, and that the location of our forces in the vicinity of Cairo ought to be continued, unless H.M.G. find that no treaty can be negotiated on the latter basis. There is probably little chance that even the present friendly Egyptian Govt, would negotiate on such a basis, but conceivably it might be worth while to suggest , that in the preliminary discussions which are contemplated the possibility of retaining the British forces in the vicinity/Minute Paper. Department. 1 1212 5000 0/32 1212 5000 0/32 vicinity of Cairo might be explored before we fall back on the proposal to locate them in places east of line 32° E., to be selected by themselves. The advantage to H.M.G. of trying to secure a treaty (despite the abortive attempts of 1928 and 1930),rather than allow the status q uo to continue, is presumably that our present position in Egypt rests solely on the unilateral declaration of 1922 and the British 'Monroe doctrine' affecting Egypt, and that it would be much more satisfactory to secure our essential desiderata on the basis of a bilateral treaty, as otherwise we stand to be shot at internationally, and might be especially exposed to criticism in regard to action which we might take in Egypt in the event of war. A strong argument for the treaty from our point of view is that it provides for a military defensive alliance with Egypt. The improvements in the 1930 draft contemplated in the F.O. letter are important - yia.* especially the provision for absolute freedom of movement of British Service aircraft, and the provision for Egyptian assistance (including the use of Egyptian ports, aerodromes and means of coirmunication) in the event, not only of war, but of serious disturbance anywhere in the British Empire* ]Cu) ^ k C't-*- V&gt;w^/ A-O ^ -A*.

Mo. 27. Your telegram D. 3 of 13th April. Resumption of negotiations with IJgypt. It appears to H^M.Goveranent in the Commonwealth of Australia that present opportunity is probably as favourable a one as is likely to offer for resumption of negotiations and that advantage should be taken of the opportunity to conclude, if possible, a satisfactory treaty in settlement of all reserved points. With regard to location and strength of British forces in Egypt they agree that it is desirable to secure substantial modifications of terms offered in 1930. The new proposal regarding location of those forces appears to HoMcGovemnent in the Commonwealth of Australia to be satisfactory, but they would like to see restriction on total strength of those forces or.iitted, as was the case in Article 8 of draft of April 17th 1930, alt^u$a they recognise 'that much of the objections to clause in latest 1930 draft would be removed by adoption of clause 4 of proposed modifications specified in your telegram under reference. Attitude proposed to be adopted with regard to Soudan and extension of provision relating to Egypt*s assistance as an ally is concurred in by H.M* Government in ihe Gonmonwealth.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Mini*ter of External Affaire Union of Ssuth Africa to tile Seer*tar/ of State for Cominion Affair®.

But the Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire nevertheless regards it as highly desirable to expedite as far as possible a decision on the Question in order that His y&amp;jesty's High Coraniseioner who is at present in this country may receive instructions before His return to Cairo and it is is hoped that the matter may be considered by the Cabinet before the end of April.

If sanctioned by His Majesty’s Grovernment these discussions, which would be carried on in Cairo between His Majesty’s High Commissioner and the Egyptian Prime Minister, would turn upon the two most important points at issue, viz. the future location of the British forces in Egypt and the future administration of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. 3. Under the former of these headings it is intended to endeavour to secure the following important modifications of the terms offered to Egypt in 1930 (Cmd. paper 3575):- (1) YiThile the British forces are to be transferred, so soon as accommodation has been provided for them at the cost of the Egyptian Government, east of line 32°, i.e. in the Suez Canal Zone, the location of the land and air forces within that area is to be that selected by themselves after careful survey, viz. in the case of the land forces the main concentration is to be on the west side of the Great Bitter Lake, and in the case of the air forces in the neighbourhood of Ismailia. (2) Provision to be secured for the absolute freedom of movement of British Service aircraft. *. 1.8 APS &gt;9^ X i y*. J The Under-Secretary of State, INDIA 05’1’ICE. (3)...(3) Egypt’a assistance as an ally to be available not merely in time of war but in the wide range of contingencies covered by the following definition:- • * In the event of imminent menace of war or of ” serious disturbance within the territories under the ’’sovereignty or authority of His Britannic Majesty or ’’territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of a ”threat to His Britannic Majesty’s essential communi- 'cat iona” . (4) No restriction to be placed upon the number of the British land and air forces to be maintained in Egypt in the contingencies contemplated under (3) above. (5) No provision for the presence of Egyptian troops on the Canal. (6) Definition in a separate convention of the privileges and immunities to be secured for the British forces in Egypt. 4. On the subject of the Sudan, the intention is to maintain and even to strengthen the relevant article of the 1930 draft, which secures in effect that the future administration of the country shall be in British hands with Egypt as a sleeping partner. As concessions to Egypt, more particularly with a view to encouraging her to continue her present financial sub vention (of £H.750,000) towards the cost of the administration of the Sudan, it is proposed (a) To provide for periodic meetings in Cairo of a Nile Commission which shall have powers of recommendation on all major issues affecting Nile waters, and (b) To accept the presence of an Egyptian agent at Khartoum with status and functions corresponding to those of the Sudan agent in Cairo. 5. I am to emphasise that no decision on these proposals has yet been reached by the Cabinet, and that more particularly, pending a Cabinet decision, the Service Departments retain their former reluctance to agree to the removal of the troops from the cities or their suburbs. But Sir John Simon nevertheless. ...nevertheless regards it as highly desirable that a decision on the question be expedited so far as possible in order that His Majesty 1 a High Goramissioner for Hgypt and the Sudan, who is at present in this country, may receive instructions before his return to Cairo. It is hoped, therefore, that the matter may be considered by the Cabinet before the end of the present month. 6. Should His Majesty's Government decide to authorise the beginning of informal discussions with the iilgyptian Government on the two main points referred to above, it is hoped and expected that the result of these discussions (which would be conveyed to the Government of India) would make it sufficiently clear whether or not the negotiation 01 the full treaty settle ment can be undertaken with an adequate chance of success. The text of the British draft settlement will be communicated to Sir 3. Hoare as soon as it has been approved by the Cabinet. 7. Pressure from the Egyptian side for a resumption of negotia tions has been very considerable over a period of nearly two years, and in Sir John Simon's view failure to respond to this pressure must result in the virtual abandonment oi the policy outlined in the Declaration of 19B2, which contemplated an Anglo- ligyptian settlement of the four Reserved Points, and would entail the risk of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom being confronted by a Nationalist movement in 'Egypt similar to that of the years immediately following the conclusion of the War. His Majesty's High Commissioner for Egypt and the Sudan has further represented that the arguments, weighty as they are, of the preoccupation of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom with other issues and of the risks attendant upon the breakdown of any further negotiations which may be initiated have already been developed to the fullest degree which is either reasonable or safe.8. Sir John Simon hopes, therefore, that Sir S. Hoare will be willing to address an urgent and secret telegram to the ^ Government of India, with a view to obtaining their observations on the proposal to initiate preliminary discussions with the Egyptian Government on the subjects of the future location of the British forces in Kgypt and of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. It is requested that the matter may be regarded as most secret. 9. A similar letter has been addressed to the Uominions Office and copies have been sent to the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry.

The Foreign Office letter to the Admiralty of which a copy has now been sent for our confidential information, but on which our observations are apparently not asked at the present stage, indicates that it is nrobable that the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations, broken off in 1930, will be resumed in the near future. It will be remembered that on the last occasion Indian interests were represented on the Committee of Negotiators by Sir K. Wigram, and/if the negotiations are resumed, it will no doubt be thought necessary to depute a military officer to represent India, since the problems involved are mainly concerned with the defence of our communications with India. It/r It will be noticed that in paragraph 4 of the letter the question is raised of an amendment of Article 7 of the draft treaty, providing that Egyptian assistance and facilities shall be available in the event of a serious internal disturbance within the Empire, and that we may be expected to be consultedat a later stage on this point. It is not proposed at present to consult the Government of India officially, but I should be glaa of any observations you may care to offer, in case it may be thought worth while to send a copy of the papers privately to the Indian Foreign Secretary, or to the 'Chief of the General Staff, for information. /S' * • 3 v 1C. f- 4- (L Sk / * 7 ^ J • J fcAt a l* — ix ^ } 2rv ^/—a ^ jL~ ^ ■ o10(;3 4000 7.32 thought/ ,1 Draft Paper. ?2 6 t / 0 political Department. of a letter from the Foreign Office to the Admiralty with its accompanying documents which form, as you will see, a Draft Treaty Settlement with Sgypt for use in the event of a decision being reache to renew the ^nglo-Egyptian negotiations which were broken off in 1930. 2.

In view of the fact that the Suez Canal, whilst being an integral part of Egypt, is a universal means of communication as also an essential means of communication between the different parts of the British Empire, His Majesty the King of Egypt, until such time as the High Contracting Parties agree that the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty and entire security of navigation of the Canal, authorises His Majesty The King and Emperor to station forces in Egyptian territory in the vicinity of the Canal, in the zone specified in the Annex to this Article, with a view to ensuring in co-operation with the Egyptian forces the defence of the Canal. The detailed arrangements for the carrying into effect of this Article are contained in the Annex hereto. The presence of these forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt. It is understood that at the end of the period of twenty years specified in Article 16 the question whether the presence of British forces is no longer necessary owing to the fact that the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty and [13708] b 3G entire security of navigation of the Canal may, if the High Contracting Parties do not agree thereon, be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for decision in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant in force at the time of signature of the present treaty or to such other person or body of persons for decision in accordance with such other procedure as the High Contracting Parties may agree.

The Egyptian Government will make available the lands and construct the accommodation, water supplies, amenities and convalescent camp, referred to in the preceding paragraph as being necessary over and above the accommodation already existing in these localities, at its own expense, but His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will contribute (1) the actual sum spent by the Egyptian Government before 1914 on the construc tion of new barracks as alternative accommodation to the Kasr-el-Nil Barracks in Cairo, and (2) the cost of one-fourth of the barrack and technical accommodation for the land forces. The first of these sums shall be paid at the time specified in paragraph 8 below for the withdrawal of the British forces from Cairo and the second at the time for the withdrawal of the British forces from Alexandria under paragraph 18 below.

The amount of the rent will be agreed between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Egyptian Government. 5. The two Governments will each appoint, immediately the present treaty comes into force, two or more persons who shall together form a committee to whom all questions relating to the execution of these works from the time of their commencement to the time of their completion shall be entrusted. Proposals for, or outlines of, plans and specifications putforward by the representatives of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will be accepted, provided they are reasonable and do not fall outside the scope of the obligations of the Egyptian Government under paragraph 4. The plans and specifications of each of the works to be under taken by the Egyptian Government shall be approved by the representatives of both Governments on this committee before the work is begun.

In the case of machinery and other stores, where standardization of type is important, it is agreed that stores of the standard type in general use by the British forces will be obtained and installed. It is, of course, understood that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom may, when the barracks and accommodation are being used by the British forces, make at their own expense improvements or alterations thereto and construct new buildings in the areas specified in paragraph 2 above. 6 .
