(JKV Dear Mr. Laithwaite, With further reference to my conversation with you at the India Office, when I promised to let you know the exact position regarding the wireless stations at Henjam and Bushire, the following notes will, I think, make the position quite clear:- a. By Article 7, (8), (4) of the General Kadiocoiifiiiunication iiegulations of Madrid 1932, the use of type B. waves (spark transmission) by land stations is absolutely forbidden from the 1st January, 1935. b. Henjam has a continuous-wave transmitter which has been constructed by the station staff from odd pieces of apparatus available. With this transmitter Henjam can conduct a service with ships as well as with Bahrein and Bushire, but its main tenance is precarious owing to the importation of wireless valves being prohibited. c. Bushire has also a continuous-wave transmitter with which somewhat unreliable comnunication can be effected with Bahrein and Hen jam, but it is unsuitable for coninunication with ships. In conclusion I might add that the Company will continue to use every effort to maintain communication, but as you will appre ciate from the above remarks the position is somewhat precarious. •“T uw*», , w I now Ig. sKg&amp;iai^T-Bs^rrcrir ^ Manager. 3le and Wireless(S 3002 646/54} FOBEIQHK OFFICE. &gt;. .1. 16th Msj 9 1934• Pear Seal, In your letter Ho. M» 01009/34 of the 8th i46jr to Leec^elles you raised the question of the operation of the Heajeua Wireless Station In the event of our being able to conclude s general treaty with Persia incorporating s so-called 'Gentleaen* s Agreement' 1 on the lines described in our despatch Ho. 60, 2. As far as I know, the point you raise was never examined here In detail; possibly It was thought unnecessary to do so while the whole question of the future of lien;}am remained so difficult and uncertain. 3. You may remember that the Hcmorandum of Conditions, agreed upon between the Secretary of state for India and the Imperial and International Communications Company when the assets of the Indo- Kuropean Telegraph Department were transferred to the Company/ Seal, EsqCompany in 1981, provided inter nlin that 'fro» the dete 'of transfer of the htlf cables and assets to the Inperlsl Xntemtitioaiil Communications Coaptny, the Imperial 'and International Commonlestione Company will undertake to maintain cable and wireless communications in the 'Gulf% The schedule of assets attached to that memorandum did not, however, refer to the wireless stations in the Gulf, and it was intimated that the question of those stations was being left for separate consideration at a later stage. In a subsequent letter (of the 83rd February, 1931) from the India Office to the Communications Company, the following passage occurs;- 'As regards the wireless stations in Persian territory, which include that at Ken jam as well as 'those at Bushlre and Llngah which you mention, I aa 'to say, for your confidential information, that no 'formal licence has been granted by the Persian 'Government for the working of these et at lone. They 'have, however, been In operation for many years with 'the full knowledge of the Persian Government, and , 'their■■■ &lt;© w th«ir future is et present the subject of diplomatic “negotiations with that Oowernment. It is not 'improbable that, in the event of a satisfactory 'outcome to these negotiations, the apparatus of the 'stations at Buahire and Lingah, and the station at 'Henj&amp;m, will be transferred to the Persian Government, ^ xx - 'a release of the last named station for a period of 'not leas than 26 years being simultaneously granted ^ “by the Persian Government to His Majesty's Government.' 4* It is on this basis that the Coimiiinlcations Company are at present operating the Wireless Station at Henjara, and I have little doubt that in the now unlikely event of a satisfactory treaty settlement, the Company would be glad to centime operating the Hen jam station on behalf of His Majesty*s Government. This, however, is really a point on which the India Office are more competent to pronounce than we are, and before writing to Tehran in the sense which you suggest, we should prefer to await such observations as Laithwaite (to whom I am sending a copy of this letter) may care to make.mam -r M.01009/34. My d ear Lascelles, C ON11)1211? IAL. A sraall point has arisen here in connection with the Persian Treaty. Although the Treaty negotiations are ! not very live at the moment, we think it would he as well to put it on record. The point is simply that we have always envisaged at the Admiralty that the Henjam Wireless Station shall continue to he operated on hehalf of H.M. Government by the Imperial and International Communications Company during the period of the Treaty. We cannot trace that a formal decision was ever taken to this effect, although apparently it was tacitly assumed under the protocol; and now that the Protocol has been superseded by the so-called 'Gentlemen’s Agreement', we wish to make sure that the same arrangement would apply. K?'&lt;5 Subject to any comments you may have to offer, we would suggest that the matter should be explained to Tehran, especially as in Paragraph 3 of Hoare’s despatch No.91 dealing with Wireless Stations in the Gulf it is stated that 'it is hoped to arrange for it (i.e., the Henjam Wireless Station) to be placed at the disposal of His Majesty’s Navy if the depot remains there'. I am sending a copy of this letter to Laithwaite. Yours sincerely. p.W. Lascelles , v .sq. , foreign Office, S.W.l v/~Note 8 . Register No. 7 . ru-\ P. Z. /c/h SECRET.
