When you were here last I touched on the question of the possibility of raising the salute of the Shaikh of Kuwait* 2* The position is this The Governors of Abadan, Mohaiamerah and the Mutasarrif of Basrah each get 7 guns from our warships^which number the Shaikh of Kuwait also gets* The latter feels that that as an independent Kuler in special treaty relations with Great Britain, he should receive more guns than mere Cover nor s of neighbouring Ports* The Shaikh who recently made a special point of calling and opening his heart to me on this very subject, pointed out that in the estimation of Iraq generally but especi ally in the eyes of the people of Basrah, itbadan and Mohanraerah the fact that he the Shaikh received an equal number of guns with the Governors of those Towns meant nothing more nor lesr than that His Majesty’s Gcv@mment considered Kuwait equal in status with those officials* This he ventured to think could not be the intention of His Majesty^ Government* The Shaikh further pointed out the anomaly that the Government of Khuzistan, certainly a large province but not equal in status to the independent Arab states of Kuwait or Bahrain, was given 13 guns, or practically double what he or Shaikh Hamad al Khalifa, the friends and ancient allies of His Majesty's Government received from H.M*S.Ships of war* The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel H*V*Biscoe, Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e.-' { y is' 5* The Shaikh gave me the impression that he felt keenly this lack of appreciation by His Majesty^ Government of his position, but graciously added that he felt sure the arrangement was a relic of Turkish days when it was not consider ed good policy to give Kuwait more guns than the Mutasarrif of Basrah, under whose Jurisdiction Kuwait was supposed hy Constantinople to come. 6 * My own personal opinion, if I may be permit ed to give same, is that both Bahrain and Kuwait should come under the XI guns category, and that Qatar should remain at 7 guns - for after all one cannot compare the importance of Qatar with either Bahrain or Kuwait* It is certainly unfair, and in my view decidedly impolitic these days, when we are endeavouring to emphasize the importance and independanoe of both Bahrain and ^uwait vis a vis Persia, Iraq and Hejd, to allow the local world to think that we place these States on a par with the Governors of neighbouring ports such as Basrah, Mohamnerah and Abadan. 7* This question of salutes especially as it applies almost entii&amp;y to visits of H.M.S,Ships, is rated very high indeed among Arabs generally and the latter cannot help but come to the conclusion that if ships salute the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait with the same number cf guns as they give to the Governors of the abovementioned Towns f then the senior ity of all five places must be the same. 8 . I shall not attempt to labour the point further but close this with the hope that if you can possibly see your way to do so, you will approach the Government of India in the matter and try and get them to make a more equitable distri bution of salutes, before the end of 1932. 9. I of course primarily speak for Kuwait if you agre with what I say as I believe you do, it naturally follows that Bahrain must receive similar treatmentNo. Jl ^ The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The political Agent, K u w ait, and is directed to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned documents.

The Political Agent, Kuwait, reported some time ago that His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait made a special ' point of calling on him and representing that hie (the Shaikh’s) receiving a salute equrd in number of guns i?) to that of tile Persian Governors of badan and Mohammerah and the Mutassarif of Basrah, would be taken by ’Iraqis in general and the people of Basrah in particular, as placing him on an equ?d status with the officials named.

During my recent visit to Kuwait ©iso Hie Excellency raised the question personally with me. 4. X fully appreciate the shaikh of Kuwait’s feeling in this matter and conceive that while we are endeavouring to emphasis© the importance and independence of both Bahrain and Kuwait vis a vis Persia, ’Iraq, and Kejd, it seems incongruous to allow the local world to think that we place the Holers of these citates on a par with the local Uovernors of the neighbouring ports of Basrah, ibadan, Mohaiamerah, and Bandar Abbas. 1 therefore strongly recommend that the salute of the present ihaikh of Kuwait be raised to 11 guns, but that it should be made personal to him. X suggest this rather than that the Kuwait State should be raised to ©n 11-gun State on the grounds that while - as far as Shaikh Ahmad is concerned - the increased personal salute will meet his complaint on the subject, from our point of view it may well be advisable to have something to offer his successor, whoever he may be, in the shape of an increased salute should his behaviour merit it. Shaikh Ahmad is persons grata with us, and in my opinion fully merits the increased person©! salute suggested. It does not, however, in any way follow that his successor will be equally deserving of it. 5 .

He observes that, although personal salutes ol 11 jruns have been granted to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit | the permanent hereditary salute accorded to these Sheilchs ia &gt;IIMiTiiilii’iTtiiillWi'ii A ---fe - 7 guns and he considers that it would be most undesirable to ( accord a larger salute to the Mutasarif than to these independent Eulers* He fears, moreover, that an increase in the salute of the Mutasarif would lead to a demand for corresponding increases elsewhere. He feels that the Governors of Bunder Abbas, Mohammerah and Abadan should be regarded on the same footing as the Mutasarif, and that any requests from them for a similar increase to that of the Putasarif would be difficult to refuse. The Secretary of the Admiralty#It therefore appears to the Secretary of State that there are strong objections to theproposal and he hopes that Their Lordships, in view of the considerations set out above, will concur in this view* A copy of this letter 1 © being sent to the ’oreign Office* 1 , etc * * ( 3d*) J* 0* WALTGH.I .£♦3406/1935 Al.lllxiU/xT, S.A.l M.226/35. 17th May, 1935.

With regard to the gun salute to be given to the Mutasarrif of Basra, Their Lordships appreciate that this question involves political considerations with which They are not primarily concerned. From the naval point of view*, however. They would depreoate any action which might encourage demands for a general increase in the scale of salutes in the Persian Gulf and They consider therefore that the argument in paragraph 2 of the letter of the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated the 14th November last is not one to be encouraged. in their view it is undesirajle to attempt to grade Governors with Naval Officers lor this purpose, and cases must be decided in their relation to the salutes given to local SheiMis and other Governors. 3. Having regard to the present scale of salutes in the Persian Gulf, shown in the enclosed statement *A 1 , My Lords would have no objection to an increase of the number of guns at present accorded to the ; utasarrif to nine, which is the number recommended by the Coramander-in-Chief, East Indies. 4.

Over our drinks and in course of conversation Commander Back said that he presumed the Bhaikh was the eldest son of the Buler and that this being so, he proposed the usual salute of 5 guns when he came aboard and returned his call* 5 . I replied that the acting Shaikh was not the eldest son of the Shaikh and that in Kuwait we never had an 'Heir Apparent', ami the eldest son never visited H.M’s ships as his father’s representative. I followed this up by expound ing the well known views of Arab rulers of Kuwait who consider it unlucky ever to nominate their heirs, as they believed only in the ancient Arab custom of allowing the best man in the family to 'win', on the ruler’s demise. 6 .

The raising of the official status of the Rulers in question would not only enable His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to refer to them in correspondence with the B&amp;udi Government in more fitting terms than at present, but would be peculiarly appropriate at the present juncture - for the reasons given by Sir Andrew yan - in connection with the G.C.B, which is being conferred 0 n King Ibn Baud. Moreover it is to our general interest to raise the prestige of these ulers as much es possible, and their present title of *His Excellency 1 ' is hardly nppropriate to independent Sovereigns which, juridically, is the position occupied by them.6. / 2 - 3. Colonel Loch in hie letter raises certf in points which need some consideration and the sene points apply also to Kuwait. I agree with Colonel 3.och (paragraph 2 of his letter) that if the title of 'His Highness' is conferred ell jff leers whojo^inar i^„ J ,1 ff It, B**ra in (or Kuwait),(with the exception of the Coriander- in-Chi ef . ( i m__iurnr - and the Political Resident, whose salutes of 15 and 13 guns respectively are more than those of the Rulers concerned, i.e* 11 guns),should make the first call on the Shaikh. At Muscat the first call on the Sultan (whose title is mis Highness”) is made by all Officers including the Oomaander-in-Chief and the Political Resident, but the Sultan’s salute is 21 guns, 4. fith regard to paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch’s letter* I agree that, for the reasons given, the title should be dynastic. In addition to these reasons it would obviously be embarrassing on the death of one of the Rulers concerned for His Raj eoty* s Minister, Jedda, to have to alter his title when mentioning the new : uler in correspondence with the Saudi Government* 5. I appreciate the point raised by Colonel Loch in his paragraph 5 , but I think it would be advisable to keep the dynastic salute at 7 guns to enable the guns for the new Ruler to be raised to 11 if his conduct proved satis factory. The anomaly which Colonel Loch refers to, of the Political Agent, with a salute of 11 guns, paying the first call on the new Ruler with p lesser salute of 7 guns, could, I think, be disregarded*-3~ 6 . Presumably from the point of view of the Government of India there is no objection to the present Rulers being accorded the style of -His Highneso' since - vide Government of IncLU letter H 0 . 121 -H, dated the 22nd September l-&gt;25 - those in Indir with 11 guns are entitled to this style of address, and the slight exception to this rule by which a new Uuler would only receive 7 guns but still be styled -Hie Highness- could doubtless be overlooked in the special circumstances ruling in the Persian Gulf# I am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Agents, *B 8 brain and Kuvy&amp;it# I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most 0 bedient servant, sd.

T should welcome an higher title for the Shaikh of Bahra in. 3. There would, however, be certain implications; for example, thst calls would be paid first upon the Shaikh in the case of all Officers (who ordinarily visit Bahrain), except the Honourable the Political Resident and His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. 4. There is also the question whether the title would be dynastic or personal. I hardly think that the title of 'His Highness” with its consequent enhancement of status could in the circumstances of the Persian G-ulf be made personal, as from the local point of view a reversal of calling procedure on the advent of a new Ruler might be very embarrassing, while from the wider point of view it would tend to defeat our object of emphasising the independent sovereignty of the Ruler. 5. It would also be necessary to consider whether the step might not make it difficult to insist on the personal eleven gun salute reverting to the dynastic seven gun salute,for if the new Ruler were to have only a seven gun salute, it would be anomalous for the Political Agent (for example) to pa.; first call. 6 . / The Honourable Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.- 2 - 6 .

G.LOCH.Confidential The Honourable the Political Resident. It may be worth while to put in writing the suggestion I mentioned this morning about the status of the Shaikhs of Kuwait end Bahrain, although it is entirely personal to myself and I have not had occesion to speak 0 n the subject to the Foreign Office. Other views may possibly be held there but I think they would in the main be guided by the opinion of the India Office and Government of India. We have had increasing reasons to emphasise vis-a-vis I bn Saud the importance which we attach to the Eastern Arabian Shaikhs and especially the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain as independent rulers bound to us by special ties. It has for some time seemed to me unfortunate that in correspondence with the Saudi Government I should have to refer to these two Shaikhs as f His Excellency 1 merely using a title which normally applies to subordinate persons and in Eastern usage to persons of quite small account. My suggestion is that His Majesty’s Government should in some appropriate way confer on them the official status of 'His Highness', the Arabic equivalent of which would be ” Soma' i.e. the title borne by the Amir of Trans Jordan and, understand the Sultan of Muscat. I approach the subject from one point of view only and there may be objections unknown to me, from other points of view. I may, however, put forward two considerations, which might make the suggestion acceptable at the present time j- (a) The King is conferring the G.C.B. on Ibn Saud and I am taking the Insignia to Riyadh. I think it would be inappropriate to confer honours of the same kind on the two Shaikhs at the present juncture but an improvement of their status in the way suggested above would mark the fact that attentions to Ibn Saud (which I ay self have advocated) do not mean that we undervalue other rulers with whom we have special relations and who have deserved well of His Majesty’s Government. (b) The end of Jubilee Year would be a by no means inappropriate time to dignify the two Shaikhs in the manner suggest ed. sd. ANDREW HYAH.

I ventured to discuss with Colonel Fowle and the Political Agents, quite privately and without in any way pre-judging your views, a suggestinn of my own that it would strengthen the position vis a vis I bn Baud in discussions affecting Kuwait (and Bahrain), if moans could be found to confer upon the ohaikh (and on the Shaikh of Bahrain, for similar reasons) the title of 'His Highness'. As I explained to the Political Resident, I am well aware that this suggestion nay present difficulty from other points of view, but I hatelong felt that, in correspondence with the Daudi Government, in which I have so often to impress on them the importance attached by His Majesty’s Govt, to the position of the Ghaikh of Kuwait (and that of the ohaikh of Bahrain) as an independent ruler, I should have to use the title of 'His Excellency', which, however respectable, is normally borne by subjects and which moreover, has nowhere been so belittled by indiscriminate use as in the Near and Middle East. 3.

It is not so much that suggestion itself which I question as the motive on which it appears to be based, seems to us that there would be considerable risk in doing anything to emphasise the importance of these Shaikhs 'as indepen- ent rulers', since, although we wish to emphasise their independence of Saudi .Arabia and of Iraq, I think you will agree that we certainly do not wish to weaken in anyway their dependence on His majesty’s Government. On the contrary I think we are all in agreement that we should aim at tightening up our control over the ohaikhs; and it is surely as part of this policy that we have so long been insisting that all political correspondence betv/een them ana Ibn oaud must pass through us. .moart from this general consideration might it not be very difficult to accord a rise in dignity to the ohaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain without doing likewise to the Shaikh of yitar, whose reputation and conduct seems very far from meriting such a distinction? Moreover, the lesser Trucial fry would probably also begin to agitate for a rise in status.No. 0.456-N/.56. From TO The Under .itcretar.

In support of this recot mendntion I am to refer to the circular letter to Local Governments on the subject of the use of the title of His High ness by Huling Princes and others in India transmit ted to you under cover of the Political Secretary's letter No.76-M, d;ted the 24th ieotember 1925. It was then decided v.ith the approval of His Majesty's Government that the use of the style of 'His Highness' would in future be restricted to Indian Ruling Princes and Chiefs enjoying salutes (dynastic, personal or local) of 11 guns and over. The Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait are both entitled to dynastic salutes of 7 guns and to a personal salute of 11 gune and it follows that there is nothing under the orders of 1925 to debar the use of this style in addressing ...2 . • s '~&gt; addressing the present Rulers of buth these Arab Prlnci lalities. 3. It is implicit in .ilr Andrew Ryan’s suggestion, as wade, that the proposed new style of address svill ainphasise the independent sovereignty of the two Rulers. But the Govern ment of India, while on general grounds they sup &gt;ort this r e c os; mend a ti on, ns endorsed by the Political Res id ent, taust in; kt it clear th- t in so doing they are actuated rather by the con sideration that the new style of address» so far from emphasising the independence of these Shaikhs, will in fact tend to bring then more into line with Ruling Chiefs in Indio who are under the suzerainty of the Crown. They have also in mind that the iheikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, being juridically independent cove eigne in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, might, should they no desire, take to themselves the title of His Majesty on the lines adopted by King Ibn Baud. Gush a claim can perhaps be most easily forestalled by adoption of the present proposal. But it should be understood that this proposal, while it will no doubt enhance the position of the Shaikhs both in the eyes of their subjects and of all other Rulers in Arabia, is In reality not one to confer on them a new title, but merely to address the© as *Hi« Highness* instead of ‘His Excellency' •as a style more appropriate to their positions. 4. It may be objected tin t the use of the title 'His JUi ■ demand on I &gt; the part of the True ini Coast rulers and in r ' particular from the chaikh of ,*atar for a6 • • « 3. ■fc»\ {l similar dignity. To this the wovernrient of ^ f i'^ India would r« ’ly that none of the Irueisi ihelkhs are entitled to a gun SHiute which uokr the orders of 1925 would carry with it the title of 'HIb Highness', while in local estimation no one of them, even including the fcaikh of Qatar, can he said to approach In dignity to the ihslkhs of Bahrein and Kuwait. The Government of India would further observe that the t-ultan of Muscat, a 21 gun Hulsr, is already addressed as ’His Highness’, and there is much to ha said for enhancing the dignities of the two leading Gulf Jhelkhe to make them more equal to those enjoyed by that Ruler. 5. As regards paragraph 4 of the Political Resident's letter I am to say that the Government of India agree that the title, once used, should be continued oa a dynastic basis irrespective of the quest! n whether the successors of the present arsorml salute of 11 guns. The Gov^rnrent of India further agree with Colonel Powle’s conclusion in para graph 5 of his letter that the dynastic salute of the Jhalkhs now ruling need not be raised at present above 7 guns as a corollary of the present pro&gt;osal. They are also in agreement with Colonel /owls * a recosmwndstion that all officers visiting Bahrain and Kuwait with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief and the Political Resident should, after the new style of address cores into use, make the first call on the sheikh.4. f? 6.

Memorandum . .v~&gt; ° ( With reference to your memorandum Ho.41/53 of 21st September 1935. I think that the following procedure might be adopted. When a Ruler proposes to be away from his Principality for a considerable period and informs me that he is appointing an individual to represent him in his absence, he should at the same time also let me know whether he wishes the representative to receive the salute due to himself as Ruler - not of course his Personal salute if he happens to possess one. I would then pass this information on to you and the representative would duly be given the salute. 2. Should the Ruler, in the case of a short absence for V instance, make no special arrangements for a representative, or appoint a representative but state that - for various reasons - he did not wisha salute to be fired then no question of giving a salute would arise, but see paragraph 5 below. 3. Please see authorities 3-6 shown under paragraph 5 (g) of Section ’ , B M of Article 55 of the East Indies Station Order Book. MUSCAT. The Council of Ministers in question was At, f ■ .y&gt;£ '-’cX; • formed during tK' time when the late Sultan laimur bin Faisal refused to live in Muscat, and was in reality a Council of Regency to carry on the Government in his perpetual absence. When Sultan Taimur abdicated and the present Sultan came to the throne in 1932 the latter dissolved the Council. The present /present Sultan has a Council to the members of which he delegates various administrative duties, but they are not entitled to any salute either collectively or individually. If the suggestion in my preceding paragraph is adopted there would be no question of a Council receiving a salute. The only individual to receive one would be the individual who will represent the Sultan. If this individual is a member of the Ruling Family he will receive 13 guns, otherwise 9. The Sultan may appoint a Council to assist this individual, but that will be merely a matter of administrative convenience from the point of view of the Sultan. I suggest therefore that the authorities 3-6 referred to above be deleted from the Table. 4. Under paragraph 5 (d) and (f) of the same Article the eldest sons of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, if they represent their father, receive a salute of 5 guns. Under the suggestion made in paragraph 2 above should the eldest son be appointed representative, and should the Shaikh wish him to receive a salute, he will receive the salute of 7 guns and not 5. If the son does not represent his father he will of course get no salute. 5. Under paragraph 5 (d) and (f) of the same Article there is the case of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait being absent for a short period having named no representative, or being sick, on the arrival of one of His Majesty’s Ships. In this contingency if the eldest son visits the ship it may be held that he does so as his father’s representative and he can be accorded a salute of 5 guns. 6. If you concur in the above suggestion you will doubtless approach His Excellency the Commander in Chief, East Indies, and will let me know the result in due course. 7. /7 for your information the following are the Personal Salutes of the Rulers His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait ' ' n M Bahrai n The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi The Shaikh of Sharjah 11 guns. 11 5 M 5 « sd.

With reference to my No.l90./587 dated 6th September 1935, paragraphs 36 to 39, the opinion of the Honourable the political Resident has been obtained, and the following procedure is now recommended. 2. When a Ruler proposes to leave his Principality, he should inform the Honourable the Political Resident whether he is appointing a representative to act in his absence, and if so, his name and whether he desires that this individual should receive a salute. This notification would then be passed to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. 3. As a rule, the son of the Ruler is seldom appointed in his father’s absence, although provision has been made for this in East Indies Station Order Book, Article 55, Section B, for Bahrain and Kuwait. If the son was however appointed to act in this capacity, he would be entitled to a salute of 7 guns at these places in accordance with paragraph 2 above. 4. There is also the contingency at Kuwait and Bahrain, of the Shaikh being absent for a short period having named no representative, or being sick, on the arrival of one of H.M. Ships. The Honourable the Political Resident suggests that in this event, if the eldest son visits the ship, it may be held that he does so as his father’s repsesentative, and in accordance with the present Article 55, he could then be accorded a salute of 5 guns. It is thought, however, that such a provision might be confusing, and that it would be best to limit the salute to the eldest son, to the occasion set out in paragraph 3 above. 5. As regards Muscat, the present Sultan dissolved the Council of Ministers or Regency Council referred to in Article 55, on his accession to the throne in 1932. He later appointed a nuinber of councillors for various administrative duties, but the Honourable the Political Resident does not consider that they are entitled to any salute either collect ively or individually. The only individual entitled to receive a salute is the Sultan’s representative - 13 guns if a member of the Ruling Family, otherwise 9. 6. In no case would the deputy receive the Ruler’s personal salute. For convenience, it is suggested that these should be inserted in Article 55. r? . The amendments suggested above have been included in a draft /draft Article 55, Section B, which is forwarded herewith for your consideration. The flag amendments proposed in No,393/E.I.2632 have not been included as Admiralty sanction has not yet been received, sd. V.S.Butler. Captain, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India that he has had under consideration your letter ho. P.Z. 1693/36 of the 17th April, regarding the proposal that the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Koweit should in future be addressed as 'Highness” instead of 'Excellency'', and to state that, in deference to the views expressed by the Government of India, and subject to the following observations, Mr. Eden does not wish to raise further objection to this proposal. /&gt; J ^ S. Mr. Eden observes, however, that in paragraph 4 of your letter ho. f.E. 1693/36 of the 17th April, it is implied that these Arab rulers are not under the suzerainty of the Grown. Furthermore in the correspondence forming the enclosures in your letter under reply, reference is made by the Government of India, and by thelolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the 'juridical independence', and by the Political Agent at koweit to the 'independence', of these rulers. Mr. Eden desires to make it clear that, while it has often been found convenient to refer to them as 'independent rulers in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government', he is advised that, in international law, the effect of these treaty relations is that these rulers are in fact not independent sovereigns but merely the rulers of British protected states enjoying a large measure of internal autonomy, and are only 'independent sovereigns' in the sense that the Indian Princes or the rulers of the Malay States are so treated in English Municipal law by the English Courts. The Under Secretary of State, India Office. 3./V 3. The Secretary of State would be interested to learn how the Government of India propose that the new title should ue conferred: that is to say, whether directly by The King, or by a communication addressed to the Sheikhs, by His Majesty*s authority, to the effect that His Majesty had approved of the use of the title of n His Highness” by all British authorities in addressing or referring to the Sheikhs. 4. A further minor point on which Mr. Eden would be glad to have His Lordships views is whether the French translation of the title !, His Highness” which it is proposed to confer on these Sheikhs should be ”Son Altesse”, in accordance with European usage, or ” Sa hautesse , a style which used, he is informed, to be employed in the case of the Khedives of Egypt. I I am, etc., Sgd. G.W.RENDEL.7 ? INDIA ONIICS, P.Z. 1693/36 WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 17til Aprils 1936. Sir, With reference to paragraph 7 of the Despatch, from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda dated 10th. December^ Ho.352, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, ror the information oi the Secretary of state for Foreign Axfairs, a copy of a letter Y/ith its enclosures from the Dated 20th February,) Government of India in regard to the proposal 1936. J ' that uhe Sheikhs of Bahrein and Howeit should in future oe addressed as ’Highness 1 and not as 1 Excellency'. 2. Mr. Secretary Eden Y/ilr observe that the Government of India, after consultation v/ith the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ana the Political Agent at Bahrein, are in favour of this proposal and, subject to any observations which Mr. Eden may wish to make, the Marquess of Zetland is inclined to agree. 3. His Lordship does not consider that the adoption of the proposal v/ould have any embarrassing results in regard to Qatar and the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms. As regards the Arab Rulers on the Trucial Coast it is not apparently at present the recognised practice to use the title of ’His Excellency’ and no question can arise of using that of ’His Highness’. As regards the Sheikh of Qatar, His Lordship sees no reason why any special favour should be shown to this ruler at present or until he merits it, but ii the higher title Y/ere accorded to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit this step might supply a useful incentive to the The Under Secretary of state, Foreign Office, S. W. 1*2 . Sheikh of Q,atar to cultivate closer and better relations with His Majesty 1 s Government. 4. His Lordship is inclined to agree with Sir A. Ryan that it would strengthen the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud if the anomaly of referring to these independent rulers as 'Excellency 71 could be avoided. Moreover he does not feel that the relations between the Sheikhs in question and His Majesty’s Government would be in any way adversely affected by the change of title. As the Government of India point out the title 'His Highness' is in fact applied in India to rulers who y umike the Arab rulers^ are actually under the suzerainty of the Crown* and while it is* of course* the case that in the Persian Gulf the title is applied to the Sultan of Muscat* who is in a position more independent than that of the other rulers* it seems hardly likely that the use of the title would be interpreted as involving a change of status or as being different in kind from* say* the grant of a Knighthood in one of the Indian Orders. On the other hand the use of the new title* which will cost His Majesty’s Government nothing* might well tend to improve relations with the Sheikh of Koweit and to counteract such feelings of disappointment as he may entertain in regard to His Majesty’s Government in other respects, while it 'would be a fitting mark of His Majesty’s Government’s ajjpreciation of the ready co-operation which they have received recently from the Sheikh of Bahrein in matters such as the transfer of the Naval Base* air arrangements* etc.* and of his general attitude in his relations with His Majesty’s Government. 5. His Lordship agrees with the Government of India that the title once used should be continued on a dynastic basis and without regard to the salute enjoyed by the individual sheikh. Ha sees no reason to object to theproposal that all officers visiting Bahrein and Koweit, with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief and the Political Resident, should, after the new style of address comes into use, make the first call on the Sheikh.. 6.

D.456-N/36. #V Pi From To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, LOWDON• Dated Dew Delhi, the 20th February 1936. , *&gt; v ' sir &gt; r With reference to paragraph 7 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch Wo. 35£, dated the 10th December 1935, I am ^ l// directed to forward a copy of a letter fro. the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Wo. 939-S, dated the 5th December 1935, with enclosures, and to say that for reasons given below the Government of India are in favour of addressing the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait in future as ’His Highness’, and not as ’His Excellency’. 2. In support of this recommendation I am to refer to the circular letter to Local Governments on the subject of the use of the title of His Highness by Ruling Princes and others in India transmitted to you under cover of the Political Secretary’s letter Wo. 76-M, dated the P4th September 1925. It was then decided with the approval of His Majesty’s Government that the use of the style of ’His Highness’ mould in future be restricted to Indian Ruling Princes and Chiefs enjoying salutes (dynastic, personal or local) of 11 guns and over. The Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait are both entitled to dynastic salutes of 7 guns and to a personal salute of 11 guns, and it follows that there is nothing under the orders of 1925 to debar the use of this style in addressing/n 2* addressing the present Rulers of both these Arab Principalities* It. is implicit in ‘&gt;ir Andrew Ryan's suggestion, as made, that the proposed new style of address will emphasise the independent sovereignty of the two Rulers* But the Government of India, while on general grounds they support this recommendation, as endorsed by the Political Resident, must make it clear that in so doing they are actuated rather by the consideration that the new style of address, so far from emphasising the independence of these Shaikhs, will in fact tend to bring them more into line with Ruling Chiefs in India who are under the suzerainty of the Crown. They have also iiimind that the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, beirg juridically independent sovereigns in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, might, should they so desire, take to themselves the title of His Majesty on the lines adopted by King Ibn Saud. Such a claim can perhaps be most easily forestalled by adoption of the present proposal. But it should be understood that this proposal, while it will no doubt enhance the position of the Shaikhs both in the eyes of their subjects and of all other Rulers in Arabia, is in reality not one to confer on them a new title, but merely to address them as 'His Highness' instead of 'His Excellency' as a style more appropriate to their positions. 4* It may be objected that the use of the title 'His Highness' will encourage a demand on the part of the Trucial Coast Rulers and in particular from the Shaikh of Qatar for a similar dignity. Tofthis the Government of India would reply that none of the Trucial Shaikhs are entitled to a gun salute which under the orders of 1925 would carry with it the title of 'His Highness*, while in local estimation no one of them, even including the Shaikh of Qatar, can be said to/I *' - I 3. to approach in dignity to the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kuwait. The Government of India would further observe that the Sultan of Muscat, a 21 gun Ruler, is already addressed as ’His Highness’, and there is much to be said for enhancing the dignities of the two leading Gulf Sheikhs to make them more equal to those enjoyed by that Ruler. 5. As regards paragraph 4 of the Political Resident’s letter, I am to say that the Government of India agree that the title, once used, should be continued on a dynastic basis irrespective of the question whether the successors of the present Sheikhs are granted a personal salute of 11 guns. The Government of Inaia further agree with Colonel Fowle’s conclusion in paragraph 5 of his letter that the dynastic salute of the Shaikhs now ruling need not be raised at present above 7 guns as a corollary of the present proposal. They are also infigreement with Colonel Fowle’s recommendation that all officers visiting Bahrain and Kuwait with the exception of the Commander-in- Chief and the Political Resident should, after the new style of address comes into use, make the first call on the 1 Shaikh. 6. In conclusion I am to add that since the Persian Gulf Rulers are not in competition with Ruling Chiefs in India, the Government of Inaia do not anticipate that the adoption of the present proposal will lead to any complications in the matter of precedence in India.

Sir Andrew Ryan f s Note dated 19th ) November 1935. ) 2. I ...) entirely concur in Sir Andrew Ryan’s view as expressed in his note. The raising of the official status of the Rulers in question would not only enable His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to refer to them in correspondence with the Saudi Government in more fitting terms than at present, but would be peculiarly appropriate at the present juncture for the reasons given by Sir Andrew Ryan- in connection with the G.C.B. which is being conferred on King Ibn Saud. Moreover it is to our general interest to raise the prestige of these Rulers as much as possible, and their present title of n His Excellency' is hardly appropriate to independent Sovereigns which, juridically, is the position occupied by them. 3. Colonel Loch in his letter raises certain points which need some consideration, and the same points apply also to Kuwait. I agree with Colonel Loch (paragraph 2 of his letter) that if the title of 'His Highness' is conferredall Officers who ordinarily visit Bahrain (or Kuwait), (with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief) and the Political Resident, whose salutes of 15 and 13 guns respectively are more than those of the Rulers concerned, i.e. 11 guns), should make the first call on the Shaikh. At Muscat the first call on the Sultan (whose title is 'His Highness”) is made by all Officers including the Commander-in-Ghief and the Political Resident, but the Sultan*s salute is 21 guns. ^ With regard to paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch*s letter. I agree that, for the reasons given, the title should be dynastic. In addition to these reasons it would obviously be embarrassing on the death of one of the Rulers concerned for His Majesty*s Minister, Jedda, to have to alter his title when mentioning the new Ruler in correspondence with the Saudi Government. 1 appreciate the point raised by Colonel Loch in his paragraph 5, buc I think it would be advisable to keep the dynastic salute at 7 guns to enable the guns for the new Ruler to be raised to 11 if his conduct proved satis factory. The anomaly which Colonel Loch refers to, of the Political Agent, with a salute of 11 guns, paying the first call on the new Ruler with a lesser salute of 7 guns, could, I think be disregarded. Presumably from the point of view of the Government of India there is no objection to the present Rulers being accorded the style of ”His Highness” since - vide Government of India letter No.l21-H, dated the 22nd September 1925 - those in India with 11 guns are entitled to this style of address, and the slight exception to this rule by which a new Ruler would only receive 7 guns but still be styled ”His Highness' could doubtless be over looked in the special circumstances ruling in the Persian Gulf.% i 'n I am senaing a copy of this letter to the Political Agents, Bahrain and Kuwait.

My dear Powle, I enclose in original Sir Andrew Ryan l s note of the 19th November 1935 about conferring an higher title than 'His Excellency' upon the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait. 2. I should welcome an higher title for the Shaikh of Bahrain. 3. There would,however, be certain implications for example, that calls would be paid first upon the Shaikh in the case of all Officers (who ordinarily visit Bahrain), except the Honourable the Political Resident and His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. 4. There is also the question whether the title 'would be dynastic or personal. I hardly think that the title of His Highness' with its consequent enhancement of status could in the circumstances of the Persian Gulf be made personal, as from the local point of view a reversal of calling procedure on the advent of a new Ruler might be very embarrassing, while from the wider point of view it would tend to defeat our object of emphasising the independent sovereignty of the Ruler. 5. It would also be necessary to consider ¥/hether the step might not make it difficult to insist on the personal eleven gun salute reverting to the dynastic seven gun salute, for if the new Ruler were to have only a seven gun salute,it would be anomalous for the Political Agent (for example) to pay the first call. 6. I have not had time to consider the matter fully,but mention the above points as they come into mind. 7. I have ventured to keep a copy of the note The Honourable . _ ~. , . n m my confidential records.

It may be worth while to put in writing the suggestion I mentioned this morning about the status of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain,although it is entirely personal to myself and I have not had occasion to speak on the subject to the Foreign Office. Other views may possibly be held there but I think they would in the main be guided by the opinion of the India Office and Government of India. We have had increasing reasons to emphasise \ vis-a-vis Ibn Saud the importance which we attach to the Eastern Arabian Shaikhs and especially the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain as independent rulers bound to us by special ties. It has for some time seemed to me unfortunate that in correspondence with the Saudi Government it should have to refer to these two Shaikhs as l His E voenpnp.y 1 merely using a title which normally applies to subordinate persons and in Eastern usage to persons of quite small account. My suggestion is that His Majesty^ Government should in some appropriate way confer on them the official status of n His Highness 11 , the Arabic equivalent of which would be n Somu rr i,e. the title borne by the Amir of Trans Jordan and, I understand the Sultan of Muscat. I approach the subject from one point of view only and there may be objections unknown to me, from other points of view. I may, however, put forward two considerations, which might make the suggestion acceptable at the present time:- (a) The King is conferring the G.C.B. on Ibn Saud and I am taking the Insignia to Riyadh. I think it would be inappropriate to confer honours of the same kind on the two Shaikhs at the present juncture but an improvement of their status in the way suggested above would mark: the fact that attentions to Ibn Saud (which I myself have advocated)mkmhhmb M do not mean that we undervalue other rulers with whom we have special relations and who have deserved well of His Majesty's Government. (b) The end of Jubilee Year would be a by no means inappropriate time to dignify the two Shaikhs in the manne r suggested. Sd. ANDREW RYAN. Bahrain, November 19th, 1935.CO Ng I Di£NTl AL POLITICAL AGlKCy NO.C-179 KUWAIT The Slst May 1936 From Captain G.S.de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Conferment of the title of 'Highness” on the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait • /*' Sir 7 •&gt; I have the honour to ask you to refer to India Office Express Letter No.P.L.3172/36 of the 15th Ivlay 1936 and point out that if the title 'Highness” i s to be taken into use by the Shaikh of Kuwait it will entail, if an awkward innovation hitherto unknown is to be avoided, the Shaikh also changing his designation to 'Emir'. This has long been in use by non-official townsmen addressers of the Shaikh, for example journalists and British Oil Companies. The main street of Kuwait is even labelled 'Emir Street' f 'Sharia 1 al Emir”. 2. It certainly sounds quite wrong in Arabic and it would be anomalous in English to say 'His Highness the Jhaikh'. Therefore if the title 'Highness' is approved of I suggest instructions might be issued at the same time to take into use the designation of Emir, except in the rather unlikely event of the Shaikh preferring to remain a Shaikh. 3. Mith regard to para 4 of the Foreign Office letter I might perhaps mention that in practice here, rare as it may be, 'Son Altesse' is used, for example by the Egyptian Aide de Caxap to the Shaikh* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your me ent servant, Political Agent, Kuwait ’ Captain,I CONFIDENTIAL.

My dear Colonel, 4 o Jr 'J)k #ould you please refer to my letter No.C-179 of the 21st May on the subject of the conferment of the title 'Highness' on the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2 . 1 would, on thinking the matter over, suggest that the change of designation to Bmir, while desirable for the reasons given, might be postponed. 3. My reasons for suggesting this are that the double change at the same time might be rather 'too strong beer' for the Shaikh, and lead him into supposing that serious alterations in our view of his grading had taken place, entitling him to a much higher plane than we contemplate putting him on. 4 . It is preferable too I think to retain in had our favours, giving them out one by one. When the change to Bmir is made, as it probably will have to be for the reasons given in my letter, it might be made to coincide with a moment when His Britannic Majesty’s Government wish particularly to show their regard for the Shaikh.

They understand that the French authorities address His Highness of Muscat as an 'Altesse', ard it is desirable that we should not be involved in embarrassing explanations of amr difference which may exist between the status of Muscat and that of Bahrain and Kuwait. 3.

They would however strongly deprecate any attempt /attempt to aneinilate the status of these Bhaj Ididoms to that of Indian Princes, since, in their opinion, the right policy to he maintained is that consistently followed in the past, vis,,, to recognise that the HhaiIchdoms exist as ^independent” units only because of the support of His Majesty’s Government, whose effective control must not therefore be relaxed, but at the same time to avoid, if possible, too close a definition of their ini ernational position in any communication made to other interested Powers 0 They would regard any public pronouncement on the subject as particularly undesirable at the present time when there is considerable pan-Arab feeling throughout the Middle ISast* The issue of the above has beer author!aedo sd.

(My d ear Sterndale Bennett), Your letter E.7034/2085/91 dated 24th November regarding Yuauf Yasin’s reference to the Shaikh of Bahrain as ’’the Amir of the Bahrain Principality”. Calvert is certain that Yusuf Yasin used ”Amir” as the Shaikh’s title and 'Imara” (i.e. amirate) for his realm. I agree that the Government of India’s suggestion is not worth pursuing. As Loch pointed out in his d.o.No.7ol-G dated 12th October, the usage in the Gulf differs from that current here. For instance, Yusuf Yasin is always called 'Shaikh”, which is used here for a townsman of consequence whom the title of off end i or Bey does not suit. On the other hand the princes 3aud and Faisal are called 'Amir' and they are roj'al highnesses, though it is true that they may be described as subordinate, though only to the King, their father. Amir is also used in Saudi Arabia for holders of superior administrative posts, such as the governorships of Tebuk and Jauf and Medina; and tnis does tend to reduce its status somewhat, even though the amirs in such cases are often relatives of Tbn Baud; but on the other hand the use of the title of *mir by the Ruler of Trans-Jordan tends the othf:r way. The fact is, what with the clash of different usages in these days when Arabic culture is tending towards unifica tion, and the difficulty in finding in Arabic the exact equivalents for the ranks, conditions and degrees recognised by us, Arabic nomenclature is still too vague for us t o draw any certain deduction from t he words used by Shaikh fuguf Yasin, However, it is an interesting point, and if we / • G. Sterndale Bennett, Esq., CMG. ,MC., Foreign Office.-g we get any evidence to support tne theory that Von Saud regards the Shaikh of Bahrain as being in way subordinate to him we will let you know.

No.452 4th December 1939; Sir, I have the honour to inform you that insofaras it is expedient, it is customary in time of war to modify the regulations concerning the firing of salutes. 2. The Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station has ordered that all salutes between Naval Authorities and on fixed anniversaries such as the Birthdays of the Royal Family, shall be discontinued during the present period of hostilities. ^ 3. It would conform to general principles, therefore, if personal and other salutes could be appropriately modified in the territories under your aegis and with which I am closely concerned. 4. I should be grateful, therefore, if you would advise me as to the desirability or otherwise of such suspension of salutes in so far as Political Officers and the various Arabian Dignitaries are concerned, and whether it might be expedient to continue the salute in any special cases. 5. Other courtesies such as official calls should of surse be '.espected, except that by common consent the occasions might be reduced and d^agg may be less formal than that which is appropriate under pacific conditions. 6. On receipt of your reply I propose that mutually an instruction should be issued on this subject, generally. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sd.) CosmM.

I think calls should be exchanged, but 1 do not understand what is meant by less formal dress.

To The Secretary to the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to your letter No.810-13/166, dated Bushire the 14tn May, 1943, and to say the proposals contained in sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of the first paragraph of your letter are acceptable to the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2. Regarding sub-paragraph (v)(b), however, I would say that I am informed by His Highness the Shaikh’s Secretary that the words 'al ma-ali' are quite incongruous with the word 'sumu'. 'Al ma-ali' is a title given to ministers of elected Governments in Egypt, Syria and Iraq and might accurately by translated into English as 'The Right Honourable The title is, I understand, also given to A.D.C’s. To apply it to a ruler is to confuse royalty with elected ministers and would be as incongruous as addressing His Majesty the King as 'The Right Honourable His Majesty King George'. 3. His Highness the Shaikh is therefore anxious that the words 'al ma-ali' should be dropped from his style of address. 4. He also takes it that there is no question of his title of 'Sir' being dropped from his style of address as appears, from sub-paragraph (i) of your letter, to be proposed for Bahrain as well as for Muscat. 5t To sum up. His Highness has intimated that he wishes to be addressed as 'Ila hadhrat al-akram al-afkham hamid ash-shiam sahib as-sumu ash-ShaiKh Sir Ahmed etc.' I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, KuwaitCONFIDENTIAL Telegram From To No. GTC.

Name and Date. i //I Subject. / / Demi-official letter No.146-3, of 30th January, 1937, from Lt. Col. T.C. Fowle, G.B.E., Bushire, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (with enclosui Title of 'His Highness' for the ShaiKhs of Bahrain and Kuwait. e).—CONFIDENTIAL THE POLITICAL AGENCY No.C/267(4/5) KUWAIT, 31st October, 1949. I notice that sorcetiire ago His Highness complained to McCAndrew of the exiguousness of his salute by comparison with that of a Vice-Admiral - para 3 of McCAndrew’s letter No.R/60(18/2) of the 28th August, 1948 refers and it seems to me that the tirre has come to consider whether His Highness* personal salute should be Increased. Indeed, I am not certain that the time has not come for the salutes of both Bahrain and Kuwait to be raised. They are both at present entitled to dynastic salutes of 7 guns and personal salutes of 11 guns. 2. In the Kathiawar Residency, where I was last, there were 11 States, none of which had dynastic salutes of less than 9 guns and four of which had dynastic salutes of 13 guns. None of them had a revenue comparable to that of Kuwait and none was so internationally important. 3. His Highness is very keen that something should be done to increase his personal status to mark the change in Kuwait*s importance that has resulted from its develop ment. There is a danger that any foreign powers that might succeed in establishing themselves here would be willing to accede to His Highness* wishes in this respect, and I would suggest that we anticipate them. In view of the length of time that His Highness has been ruling here (27 years) and of his age - he is 63 -, the greatly increased importance of modern Kuwait, and the excellent cooperation we have had from His Highness and his officials who whatever they themselves might like to do take their cue very much from His Highness, I should like strongly to recommend that his personal salute be increased to 13 guns or even 15 guns. 4. He is older and has been ruling his State very much longer than any of the other Rulers of the major Gulf States and, if you do not think there is sufficient reason for raising Bahrain at the same time, a personal distinction for Sheikh Ahmed could be explained on these grounds. 5.
