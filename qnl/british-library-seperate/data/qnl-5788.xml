The dispute was sparked by the Ruler of Sharjah, Shaikh Ṣaqr bin Khālid Āl Qāsimī’s cancellation of the concession in 1907, and subsequent claims by Wönckhaus and Company and the German Government, over financial losses arising from the cancellation of the concession.The majority of the file’s correspondence is in German. Letters exchanged between the German Consul at Bushire and the British Political Resident are in French. In most cases, German correspondence is preceded by undated pencil notes written in English, giving a précis of the letter that follows.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the German Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>German Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Abū Mūsá</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Robert Wönckhaus and Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Concessions, red oxide, Abu Musa</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mining</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ferric oxide</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d7#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d7#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000d7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
