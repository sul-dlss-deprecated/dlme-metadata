The correspondence is mainly between the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain (often acting in his dual capacity as Food Controller for the Government of Bahrain), and also between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire and Government of India officials in New Delhi. The file contains estimates compiled by the Persian Gulf authorities, regarding the annual requirements for local consumption of dhal in Bahrain and the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms, and communications from the Government of India about the annual import quotas fixed for Bahrain, the Trucial Coast, Kuwait and Muscat. Also included in the file are numerous lists providing details of the distribution of quarterly quota allotments (in tons) for the importation of dhal, among approved merchants in Bahrain, Dubai, Kuwait and Muscat, together with the names and addresses of their authorised exporters and shippers in Karachi. There are also wider discussions, including the reaction of the British Indian vegetarian Hindu community in Bahrain to bans on the export of Indian pulses in 1943 and 1946, due to food shortages in India. There is some merchantsâ€™ correspondence from Bahrain importers and Karachi exporters, complaining about such matters as Government of India delays in releasing consignments of Indian pulses for shipment to the Persian Gulf and being refused export permits.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Food Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Export Trade Controller, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Food Controller</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Sind, Deputy Chief Controller of Prices</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Punjab</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bombay</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Karachi</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Food control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pulses (crop)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cd#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cd#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
