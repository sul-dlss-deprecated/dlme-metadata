Hay writes that there was no need to take Gwadur [Gwadar] into consideration at that time. The letter encloses copies of correspondence from the Commonwealth Relations Office and Foreign Office dated January 1949 relating to the future of the Hindu community in Muscat, and the proportion of that community that would become United Kingdom citizens under the terms of an amendment to the British Nationality Act, 1948.The covering dates of the correspondence (the main body of papers in the file) are 20 January 1949 - 19 February 1949. The closing date in the overall date range is provided by an entry in the notes at the rear of the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Nationality</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003b9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
