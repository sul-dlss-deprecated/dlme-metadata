Some have suggested that the round, moon-shaped \r\nform originated in the Near East, but no matter what the origin, the various \r\nexamples bear witness to travel of both people and technologies throughout the diverse cultural landscape of the Silk Route.</p>\r\n<p>This peacock-green pilgrim flask draws attention to the efforts of artists in \r\nseventeenth-century Safavid Iran to interpret the fine Chinese celadon wares \r\nwidely exported under the Song (960&ndash;1279). Chinese products and designs \r\nwere greatly admired and sought in Iran, where popular tradition and literature \r\nlauded the artistic talents of the <i>Khit&#257;\u2019&#299;</i>&mdash;natives of Cathay, a historical term \r\nreferring to northern China. The lotus bud motif on this bottle may be inspired \r\nby Chinese images of the flower, but the molded composition of scrolling flowers and vines appears widely in Islamic vegetal decoration.</p>", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-08-01", "date_added": "2008-09-26 00:00:00", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "36.942_front_PS2.jpg", "id": 26917, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/36.942_front_PS2.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/36.942_front_PS2.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 82, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 165, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 330, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 660, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1320, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/36.942_front_PS2.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Pilgrim Flask</em>, early 17th century.
