Bird, Political Officer, frucial Coast, Sharjah, to Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. Subject : Diba affairs The Truce between the Shihuh and Qawasim of Diba expired after the «Id on 25th November 1944, and Shaikh Humaid bin 'Abdullah reported a few days ago that one woman and a boy had been killed. He also said that Shaikh Muhammad bin Hamad of Fujairah had attempted to conclude a further truce fe&amp;fcx but he understood that he had been unsuccessful. 2. I have asked Shaikh Humaid to obtain confirmation that fighting has again broken out and also to let the Khan Bahadur know details of Shaikh Muhammad's negotiations. N*0.1.C. Hormuz reported today that he had received information of fighting in Diba. 3. As I understand the position, the Sultan of Muscat is unlikely to agree to the suggestion that a Wall be appointed to Diba, and the Government of Muscat are incapable of settling the controversy themselves. That being the case, the Khan Bahadur suggests that % Shaikh Humaid, or rather the Regent of Kalba, be told that he is at liberty to settle incidents between his people and the Shihuh direct in the normal manner and in accordance with tribal customs. I think it is the only solution and recomiftend that the Sultan of Muscat is informed that the Regent of Kalba has been told to settle all future incidents direct with the shihuh. At least this method seems worth trying in view of the failure to obtain any satisfaction through the Muscat Government./% BRITISH RESIDENCY AND CONSULATE GENERAL, BIZSHIBS, No. 107^-14/247.

Time has gone and he has not arrived.

He found that the Sharqi has put an end to the trouble by bringing about a truce lasting*for a few days the period of which has expired. I have, therefore, written to Shaikh Muhammad bin Hatted to come to you for the purpose of removing the misunderstanding bringing about good neigh bourly relations and restoring order in a way that no one will be prejudiced by it. N 0 doubt h you are one of those who like to do good, prevent bloodshed and extinguish the fire of troubles as required by Islam. I hope you will agree tc this and authorise it.
