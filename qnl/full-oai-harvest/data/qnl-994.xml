Much of this correspondence consists of copies of English translations of letters between Abdul Aziz ibn Abdulrahman ibn Faisal Al Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Saud)] and Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ of Kuwait.Correspondence early on in the file relates to reports of encroachments into Kuwaiti territory by officials of Ibn Saud. Later, the correspondence discusses a visit made by Shaikh Ahmad to Bahrein [Bahrain] and Dabai [Dubai] and a visit made by Ibn Saud to Kuwait in 1936. After details of Ibn Saud's visit are reported, the file contains lengthy correspondence between British officials regarding Britain's control over Kuwait's foreign relations. This includes a note entitled 'Foreign Relations of Kuwait' that was written by Sir Andrew Ryan, Britain's Minister to Saudi Arabia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
