Craftsmen glazed faience pieces in three different ways. The simplest and oldest method involved brushing the object with, or immersing it in, liquid glaze before firing. Alternatively, workers mixed a crystalline mineral salt with the faience and allowed it to evaporate to the surface while the object dried. This mineral salt then melted and fused into a glaze during firing. In the third technique, an artisan buried the object in a glazing powder that fused with the core during firing. To decorate faience objects, craftsmen painted on designs before firing or mixed the moist faience paste with mineral colorants. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike faience, glass was a foreign import that arrived in Egypt from western Asia shortly before 1500 <small>B.C.E.</small> The first Egyptian glassmakers relied on molds, limiting production to small objects such as beads and amulets. Later craftsmen perfected techniques that allowed for large, complex pieces.  <b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecreational Objects<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Egyptians were fascinated by faience&rsquo;s bright colors and lustrous finish, and fashioned a wide variety of recreational objects in the material. </b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hollow faience ball in this case&mdash;too fragile to have been tossed&mdash;probably served as a rattle during musical performances or religious rituals. The charming object in the form of an ape was a playing piece in one of the many Egyptian board games.", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-12 16:33:04", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "09.879", "object_id": 3257}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.09.879_36.125_erg456.jpg", "id": 80974, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.09.879_36.125_erg456.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.09.879_36.125_erg456.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 70}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 140}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 280}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 560}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1121}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.09.879_36.125_erg456.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Game Piece in Form of an Ape</em>, ca. 1539-1390 B.C.E.
