In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's intention to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ, and the Shaikh of Mohammerah by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in the First World War.The correspondence is mainly between British officials discussing the possible solutions to the gardens taxation issue. Among the suggested solutions was the selling of the property. British officials report that the Shaikh of Kuwait is entirely flexible in regards to the selling of certain estates but not the ones in Al-Faw. But they also suggested that it would be rather useless for the Iraq Government to attempt to purchase the gardens as they belong to more than a hundred relatives of the Shaikh who depend on the produce for their maintenance.The volume includes statements of an estimated value of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s estates on Shatt al-Arab. It also contains economic reports on the proposed new basis of taxation on agricultural produce in Iraq, and copies of the Government of Iraq’s new laws for the collection of consumption (
                           Istihlak) tax and for the collection of land rent and water rent (ff 79-101). The correspondence also includes records of meetings held in London in regard to the question of the taxations as well as the new system of land revenue collections in Iraq.The main correspondence is between the British Resident, Bushire, the Political Agent, Kuwait, the High Commissioner, Baghdad, and the Colonial Office, Downing Street, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Al-Fāw</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Estates (land)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consumption</topic></subject><subject><topic>Water</topic></subject><subject><topic>Meetings</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Mohammerah</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Mohammerah Khaz'al bin Jābir bin Mirdāw al-Ka'bī</namePart></name></subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ṣabāḥ (Family)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shatt al Arab</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Taxation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Land</topic></subject><subject><topic>Date Gardens</topic></subject><subject><topic>Conferences</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000053#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000053#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000053#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
