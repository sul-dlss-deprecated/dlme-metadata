A. * u^Lt fiL. t lud - -. *&lt;&gt;ll. I have enquiries about the introduction of licences to fish-sellers and the present position of the fish supply. Upjto about 19 days ago, the fish-sellers were selling the fish in the fish market without bearing licences from the Municipality, but it happened that they started to play fast and loose with the fish that come to the market. They conceal it and sell it to private individuals with a price higher than that of the control. The Municipality thought that such play can be checked by the issue of licences to the fishers in which they sare provisions to be observed. Since July 7th, they have issued licences to 27 fish-sellers. how I have come to comment on the scarcity of fish at Manama. There are two reasons. One of them is that during summer time the seav/ater on the beaches becomes hot by the direct sun and the hot rocks or sand exposed to the sun during the day. The fish do not stay in hot water, but little of them. The majority goes out to the deep sea where the water is cold. The other reason is that the fish-sellers of the market indirectly order their sons and servants v/ho usually collect the fish for them from the fishers, to sell it outside the markets to private individuals who pay more price. The fish-sellers, by doing it indirectly, can mislead the people and make them believe that the fishers who sell their fish outside and do not bring it to the market for sale to the public. The correct story is this. The fishers are constantly indebted to the fish-sellers of the market, because the latter give them advances for expenses, money to repair their fish-traps and fish-cages and assist then in napy ways. In view of his indebtness to the fish-seller, the fisher cannot dare to dispose of any of his fish. Moreover the fish-sellei have arranged their sons and servants to go in the proper time to the fishers and collect the fish from then. The Municipality, b: issuing licences to the fish-sellers of the market, cannot prevent or induce them to bring the fish to the market. xhLso last evening a notice from the Food Control was&amp; v fish at Jitra. I suggest one solution, and if it has boon put into force, the fish will be brought to the market by the fish-sellers themselves. It is that the members who are representing the those villages and make them responsible before the Food Control for Keeping an eye on the fishers to supply the fish to the fish-sellers of the market or their servants toho go there and collect it. Also the fish-sellers should furnish an undertaking that neither their sons nor servants can dispose of the fish outside t’ e market and everyone infringes the order may be fined and the licence withdrawn from him. villages in the Food Control Committee, especially for Sitra and ns adjacent villages, must be asked to bring the Kukhtars of all JTranslation of letter Ho.681/3/1363, dated 5th June 1344 from the Assistant of the Manana Municipality to the Political Ayent, Bahrain. a r* i l • The Baladiyah Committee has been called to xiold a meeting on Tuesday, 15th Jamad al Than! 1363 (6-6-44) at 1.30 o’clock Arabic time instead of Thursday to ratify the amendments inserted by the board in some Articles of the Regulation.
