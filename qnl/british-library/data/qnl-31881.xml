Gastrell has written to us again on this subject, as he is obviously worried by the prospect of losing his last remaining two Indian clerks on the 14th August. As time is so short we have written direct to Grafftey- Smith (copy enclosed) explaining the position and telling him that we hope that he will shortly be receiving instructions from London to approach the Pakistan Government.. We should therefore be very grateful if you could let us know your decision urgently, and if it is favourable could you please have the necessary instructions sent to Grafftey-Smith by telegram? Yours ever. (3d.) Archie Ross A.J. Gardener, Esq., C.B.E., Establishment and Organisation Department, The Foreign Office, London, B.W.1.1 56/21 Aa 'ow. fc.tr British Embassy, Tehran. 22 nd July, 1948 % I have asked the Foreign Office whether we may \\ jnlist your help with the Pakistan G-overnment in the following matter which concerns the accounts of the Zahidan Consulate. In a recent despatch Gastrell, our Consul-General at ivieshed, has asked to be relieved of financial responsibility for Zahidan. I may explain that until 13th August 1947 the annual budget and monthly accounts of the Zahidan Consulate ’were regularly checked in the office of the Consul-General, Meshed, and forwarded by them to External Affairs Department and the Accountant General Central Revenues at New Delhi. Since that date Pakistan have been paying for the Consulate as a temporary measure, and Meshed have been sending the accounts to Karachi. Gastrell points out that whereas in the old days the Consul-General at Meshed had several Indian clerks, including a trained accountant, on his staff, now he has lost his accountant and after 15 th August next will have no clerks at all with experience of India and the Indian accounting system. He will therefore not be in a position to supervise the accounts of the Zahidan Consulate, and he suggests that in future they should be supervised either by the Pakistan Embassy here or by the Accountant General, Central Revenues of Pakistan** We have asked the Pakistan Chargd d* Affaires what he thinks about it and whether he would be willing to undertake the responsibility in question. He is definitely unwilling to do so* Whan Pakistan establish their own Consulates, he says, they will doubtless be placed under the charge of the Pakistan Embassy, the staff of which will be strengthened for the purpose. Until this happens he requests us to arrange with the Pakistan Government for the Zahidan accounts to be super vised by their Accountant General in direct correspondence with the Consul. This seems to me to be the most suitable arrangement, and I hope that the Foreign Office will shortly move the Commonwealth Relations Office to send you instructions in this sense. I shall be very grateful to know as soon as possible whether the Government of Pakistan agree. (Sgd.) M.J. CxtH^.ELL. Sir L.B.
