[E 204/54/251 January 11, 1937. Section 5, J Copy No. Ill A\ Hullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received Januaru 11, 1937.) (No. 326.) Sir, Jedda, December 21, 1936. ALTHOUGH the terms of the Saudi-Egyptian Treaty of the 7th May, 1936, and of the dependent agreements of which the texts were sent to the Foreign Office in my despatches No . 308 of the 25th November and No. 321 of the 12th December speak in the main for themselves, I have the honour to submit brief comments on the subject. 2. On the whole, the result of the negotiations must be considered as an almost complete victory for Ibn Sand. After being officially ignored by Egypt since his conquest of the Hejaz he receives full recognition from this relatively powerful Arab State. He has been able to maintain his objection to the transport of the Mahmal from Jedda to Mecca with its guard and its band, and his acceptance of the despatch of the Mahmal as far as Jedda can only he considered as a device to save the face of the Egyptian Government to some extent. And, finally, he secures what is of great economic importance to him and to the Hejaz, viz., the renewal of expenditure in the Hejaz of the funds which, except for the 100,000 bushels of wheat sent for the poor of Medina in 1035, have been cut off since the tragic Mahmal episode in 1926. The only important point on which the Saudi Government were defeated was the payment of arrears. The expenditure is to be resumed with effect from the forthcoming pilgrimage, and the arrears are gone for ever. But the past may well be forgotten in the contemplation of the rosy future, wherein Egyptian trust funds will effect improvements in the Hejaz which would either have to he done out of the inadequate funds of the Saudi treasury or be left undone to the scandal of pilgrims from countries which are better administered. The Egyptian Government is to be “allowed” not only to repair the mosques at Mecca and Medina, hut also to undertake works which, while primarily intended for the comfort of pilgrims and other visitors, will he of benefit to the country in general, including as they do the construction of roads, the lighting of the neighbourhood of the two mosques as well as of the mosques themselves, and the provision of drinking-water. 3. When Ibn Sand counts up the gains of his annus mirabilis, 1936, which was marked also by the Saudi-Iraq Treaty, the renunciation by His Majesty’s Government of the vexatious right of manumission of slaves and the other concessions made to him in connexion with the Treaty of Jedda, and his participation in the joint measures taken by the Arab rulers in regard to the troubles in Palestine, he will probably put the treaty and agreements with Egypt high on the list. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt, Cairo. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. [906 1—5]COPY (E 3198/202/25) No. 145 . (9C~ 62/16). British Legation Jedda. 14th May, 1956 Sir, With reference to previous correspondence ending with Sir Miles Lampson^ telegram to you No. 404 of May 9th, I have the honour to forward herewith, in accordance with standing instructions, the text of the Treaty just concluded between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It was published in a special number of the Umm al Qura on May 9th, copies of which were communicated the same day by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the foreign missions here. 2. I had a short conversation with Sheykh Yusuf Yasin about the Treaty on the morning of the 9th before I had seen the text. The success of the negotiations has, I gathered, given great satisfaction in high Saudi circles, although Sheykh Yusuf spoke of its actual contents, apart from the settlement of the question of recognition, as being more anodyne than they in fact are. Article V of the Treaty may prove to be of considerable practical importance. 5. Sheykh Yusuf mentioned the fact that the Treaty had been concluded with the Egyptian Council of Ministers, as temporary repository of the sovereign power in Egypt. He did not make any comment on this procedure, which is presumably in accordance with the Egyptian Constitution. I attach more importance to his description of a telegram which The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P.,which Ibn Saud had addressed to the Egyptian Prime Minister as constituting a ’'ratification’'. This word is not applied to the King f s telegram in a note appended to the enclosed text of the Treaty, which reads in translation as follows 'The Egyptian Council of Ministers has approved this Treaty. The Premier has ratified it in his capacity as the depositee of all judicial, legislative and executive power which has by law been vested in him. His Majesty the King sent a telegram to His Excellency Aly Maher Pasha in this form expressing His approval and acceptance of the provisions of this Treaty.” 4. As Article VII of the Treaty itself provides for a formal exchange of ratifications in Cairo, I presume that the proceedings mentioned in the note just quoted are to be regarded as merely preliminaries to a proper exchange of instruments of ratification. You will remember that the practice of the Saudi Government in this respect was at one time loose and created obscure situations e.g. in the case of the Treaty of Muhammerah of 1922 and the dubious Saudi-Yemen 'Treaty of Abu Arish' of December 15th 1931. In other cases since 1927 the strict practice has, so far as I know, been consistently followed. 5.

Dynastic feuds have been largely instrumental in keeping Saudi Arabia apart from the other independent Arab States, but Ibn Saud has now managed to overcome these obstacles and establish friendly relations with Sgypt (see text of the treaty recently signed in Cairo at P.Z.3346/36) and a closer union with Iraq (see P.Z.1197/36). The inter-relation ship of the present agitations in Syria, Palestine and !3gypt has been stressed in recent reports which have been separately submitted and it is clear that the nationalist aspirations of these countries/ 2730 1000 4,34countries will reach formidable proportions if they receive solid support from the newly formed bloc of independent Arab Powers.

(E 2491/202/35) r-\ f's 37 8 19 3 y BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA. 18th April 1936. 3o © Sir, With reference to my printed despatch No. 103 cu 13th, enclosing translations of telegrams exchanged hetween the Saudi and Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the impending negotiations between their Governments, I have the honour to state, as already mentioned in telegrams on other subjects, that Fuad Bey Hamza left Jedda for Cairo on April 14th, a day later than he had originally intended. He was accompanied by Taufio,. Hamza and Muhammad Shaikho who are employed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and also by two well-known local Syrian merchants, Huseyn Awayni and Ibrahim Shakir. It was understood at first that the last-named two gentlemen were members of the Saudi delegation. ibis suggested that they might be intended to take part in any commercial negotiations ancillary to the main subjects to be discussed. When, however, I mentioned this idea of mine to Fuad Bey in the course of general conversation on April 13th, he said that the two gentlemen were merely personal friends of his, who were taking the opportunity of accompanying him to Cairo but would not be making any long stay there. 2. As you are aware the greatest obstacle to the establishment of normal relations between Saudi Arabia and Egypt has been the personal reluctance of King Fuaa to recognise Ibn Saud. This will doubtless be one of the first subjects of negotiation. It has indeed been suggested to me that/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc •, etc., etc• 1that recognition has already been accorded by the use of full titles in the telegrams enclosed in my despatch under reference, but I doubt this. The nearest precedent I can recall is that of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, in which case it was held that the use of titles in correspondence exchange in 1930 had constituted recognition and that no further preliminary of the kind was required for the completion of the negotiations, which culminated in the Saudi Iraq Treaty of April 7th 1931. The correspondence in question was, however, between the rulers of the two countries. •5. In any case the question of recogntion is unlikely to cause any further difficulty between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It is very significant that the negotiations between them have been initiated so soon after the conclusion of the Saudi Iraq Treaty of Islamic Brotherhood and Alliance of April 2nd, to which it is hoped to make the Yemen also an acceding party; and at a time when the French Government have been negotiating with a Syrian nationalist delegation; not to mention the fact, probably of less importance in this connexion, that His Majesty's Government also are engaged in negotiations of capital importance with the Egyptian Government. Everything points to the conclusion that the Saudi Government, influenced doubtless by the course of events in Europe and the hope that European difficulties may rebound to the advantage of the Arab cause generally, have plumped for the policy of something in the nature of an alliance of independent Arab States, which might in favourable circumstances concern itself with the affairs of other Arab countries. It is true that the clauses, which pointed most clearly in the latter direction, were omitted from the recent Saudi Iraq Treaty; but this does not exclude the possibility of attempts to increase the influence of the independent states in the affairs of countries like Syria, possibly/5 l ® possible even Palestine, Kuwait and the states in the east and south-east of Arabia. I do not suggest that such developments are imminent and I still rely a good deal on Ibn oaud. s native caution, but I do consider that the v/hole movement calls for great watchfulness on the part of His hlajesty s Government• 4.

Ke said that discussions with Ali Maher had Been postponed owing to the latter’s oreoccupation with the King’s illness* The next meeting was fixed for tomorrow evening. 2. He said that he had received a message from Ihn Baud instructing him to thank me for my co-operation and to acquaint me with the representations of the Italian Minister at Jedda which had already been Brought to the Knowledge of Sir Andrew Ryan (see Jedda telegram to you No. 55 of 26.4.56). Ihn Baud instructed Fuad Hamza to ask me whether I thought any Italian influence here was responsible for the delay in negotiations and difficulties which Hi Maher was making. 5. Fuad Bey Hamza went on to say that the Italians were likely to make proposals to the Hejaz G-ovemment with a view to winning its sympathy. He also referred to Ihn Saud's request to us for assurances against Italian aggression last autumn. These assurances, he said, His Majesty's Government had unfortunately heen unahle to give hut His Majesty’s Government had acquainted the Saudi Government with the 1927 agreement with Italy. (Bee Jedda despatch No.l of January 1st, 1956, to you.) 4. I replied that I had no information to show that the Italians were behind airy obstruction to negotiations hut that of course the possibility could not he excluded. 5. I then went on to say that I had no wish to sow dis trustdistrust of Italians 'but that I thought that the Hejaz C-ovex/iment v/ere v/ell advised to he so cautious towards approaches of a Gl-ove mnent whose eagag eiuents, e.g. Kellogg x^acu, League I act, treaty regarding gas warfare, etc., had proved of so little value. 6&lt;, Ihiad Bey said that Eafez Afifi, on instructions from Ali halier, had had a discussion with him just before his visit to me. Hafez Afifi had suggested as a way out of the Kahnal difficulty that Ihn Baud should in principle admit the Mahnal hut that the Egyptian Government should of its own accord dis continue its despatch* Another suggestion made in the con versation was that hahmal should only proceed as far as Gedda. 7. Fuad Boy said that he was rather perplexed.what to do. The political situation in Egypt was uncertain and equally uncertain was how long the present Government would he in office. His Government would not give way in essentials regarding the Iviahmal and if the Egyptians would not agree to Ihn Baud' s point of view, the negotiations would have to he broken off. has it better to avoid a rupture of negotiations with a view to waiting further governmental developments in Egypt? I said that my advice was that he should go to the meeting tomorrow and try to effect a compromise. If he failed, we could then have another friendly discussion and I would do my best to grease the wheels. If by any chance the meeting v/as again put off we could similarly discuss matters with a view to seeing whether I could do anything to help. I trought it advisable in any case that- the utmost should he done to avoid a break, particularly as the difference between the tv/o parties seemed now to be so slight. 8. Fiad Bey Hamza agreed and thanked me for my advice.

As regards (1) Ali Maher had proposed that tne ftahmal should be sent without ceremony by sea to Jedda and thence to Mecca by motor transport mid without the usual procession. Fuad Bey Hamza had made the counter-proposal that the Mahmal should be aoandoned but that the Sacred Carpet should more or less take its l.c. tne Carpet should be despatched by the King of Egypt and received with the ceremony similar to that with which the Mahmal used to be received, lie had no authority to advance this proposal but thought that Ion Saud would accept it. Ali raher, however, had begged him to refer to Ibn Saud the Egyptian proposal mentioned above. He had accordingly telegrapneo. to Ion baud. Fuad Bey Hamza said that he had pointern out oo .Hi leaner that in Turmish days there were three and sometimes four Mahmals which were sent to Mecca and that this was naturalnatural at a time when all the countries concerned formed part of the Turkish Empire. Now, however, if an Egyptian Manmal were accepted there \/as no reason why the Hejaz should refuse an Iraqi or Syrian Kalrmal, 5, I remarked that the difference between the two countries seemed to have narrowed down and that I hoped a com promise acceptable to both sides would be found. 6« As regards (5) Fuad Bey Hamza said that Ali halier was prepared to devote again the haqfs of the Holy Places to the Hejaz but was not inclined to make money payments, his idea being that the &lt;aqfs should be expended in actual works of sanitation and charity etc. 7o Fuad Bey Hamza seemed on the whole optimistic but feared that King Fuad 1 s influence might be a hindrance 0 lie was also rather apprehensive about a possible change oi Government here and King Fuad’s health, both oi which iactors might delay a settlement. 8. He was extremely frank and friendly. He subsequently told the Oriental becretary that he expected to have recourse to us to smooth over difficulties which might arise. 9. I will endeavour to hold the scales equally between the two as far as my good offices are sought by botn sides.INDEXED Fn any further communication on this subject, please quote r '1 * No. and address —not to an^personTy^atfe, ^ ^he Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. this subject, please quote i/^, /i £-J n ! 29 25 ' 1936 _j n AfTSlTs presents his THE Under-Secretary of State for compliments to by direction of the Secretary of Sta transmits'Hierew erewith cop ^c^-of the under-mentioned paper. rKV'* 1 '*^ecode.

Prime Minister tells me that Hejazi Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has informed him that King Ibn Sand has now- replied that though he would not himself object to Mahmal, his subjects v;ould, and therefore he cannot agree. 2. Prime Minister had answered that in that case above fact should be recorded and treaty signed leaving it to time and better enlightenment for objection of Hejazi people to be overcome. Question of escort and band had I gathered been dropped. 5. Prime Minister had added that even if a treaty could not be signed Egypt would be prepared to recognise King Ibn Saud and appoint a diplomatic representative provided Egypt were allowed to provide the necessary improvement of conditions of pilgrimage such as road, sanitation and lighting. 4.

More motor ambulances were with the mission, which also wished to fly the Egyptian flag. Ibn Sand, irritated by Egypt’s refusal to recognise him, objected to this enlargement of the Egyptian Medical Mission. 3. According to Dr. Shahin Pasha, Under-Secretary of State for Public Health, the various objections of the Elejaz Government were discussed with the Hejaz agent here. It was agreed that the mission should fly the sanitary instead of the Egyptian national flag. Permission was given to the whole mission to proceed, except to the motor ambulances, further negotiations on this point are continuing. Dr. Shahin added that Naiias Pasha had sent a message just before his departure to England to the Hejaz agent, suggesting that these difficulties were being raised owing to the non-recognition of Ibn Sand by Egypt and assuring him that the Egyptian Govern ment, on the return of the delegation from England, would tackle this larger question in the most sympathetic spirit. 4. I suggested to Sheikh Hafez Wahba that Ibn Saud was ill-advised to translate his resentment at his own non-recognition into the realm of pilgrimage relief. Such action would help the adversaries of recognition, who would have little difficulty in exploiting this obstruction in a sense unfavourable to Ibn Saud. Hafez Wahba agreed, and said that he had already telegraphed to the Amir Faisal at Mecca, urging that it was not worth while making difficulties about the Egyptian Medical Mission. 5. The Sheikh expressed indignation at the tone of the press, inspired by the Palace. The “ Ittehad,” “ La Liberte ” and the “ Ahram ” have, indeed, published some extremely offensive articles about the difficulties being made by the Hejaz Government over this mission.

Sir. /Mfe.* Your despatch »o.380 (i, 3214/1477/91) of August 29th last, regarding the recognition of Ibn Baud by Rgypt, reached ne Just after my arrival in Jigypt. The political situation waa then abnormal, and the Oovurnsraent of Kohamed Mahmoud Pasha was already in a parlous plight. Relations between His Majesty and the Prime Minister were, moreover, very strained. I vms therefore, compelled to postpone action to a more favourable opportunity. 2. At the beginning of October, Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha was succeeded by Adly Yeghen Preha, whose Government, on the ground of its transitional nature, refused to handle any but current and ur gent affairs. I did not wish to males representations to the King except in agreement with his Government. Obviously it was useless to discuss such a problem with the Head of a transitional Government. 3. The first days of the Wafd Government were occupied by matters of such importance and urgency that only recently have 1 been able to find s suitable opportunity for dismissing the question with Hates P^sha. His Excellency, whils expressing himself favour able to the principle of recognition, said that it must The Ri^ht Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P*, etc*, etc # , eto. be!&gt;* preceded by the settlement of eertain religious differences between the two countries. I pointed out to His Jteoellency that in our riew. and it was indeed evident, Ibn Sand was the only power at present able to keep the Arabian Peninsula quiet and stable. Peaoe and s+nbi3ity in the peninsula ware to ths adTrntage of all its neighbours, any weakening of Ibn Saud f s position would threaten both by com promising the relatively ordered scheme of things now existing. Both iSgypt and we ourselves would suffer from disturbances or disorder. His Jiixeallency would moreover have noted from ths efforts made by His Majesty's aovemmsnt in difficult and delicate circum stances to bring about a reconciliation and even friend- : between King Peisal and King Ibn Hamud, how greatly we were ourselves attached to a policy of pacification, order, and mutual friendlinese. 4, k has Pasha replied that he was not Very familiar with the situation in the peninsula, but he w e gener ally in agreement with sur views and recognised the eminently pacificatory character of British policy in thoae regions. He said that on his return from London he would take ths matter in hand earnestly, and hoped that his efforts would be sueesssfhl, 5. In view of my forthcoming departure for London and the consequent in^ossibility of following up any repre entations which X might make to King Puad, I haveIt &amp; h»T« decided to refrain from any such representation at the moment.

Z' The arguments in favour of bringing some pressure to bear on King Fuad in this matter are set out in Lord Lloyd's despatch of the 15th June, and in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office letter. Prima faci e there seems much to be said for endeavouring to dispose of this question of recognition (which, if Ibn Saud continues in power, will have to be faced sooner or later) at the present stage, when from our point of view it is generally desirable to work in with Ibn Saud and to do what we can to prove our friendliness to him in some practical way. ,e are not, however, at all so directly concerned as either the Foreign Office or the Colonial Office, save from the point of view of possible reactions on Indian Mohamedans of pressure ” on the Xing of Eg^pt. The question of reactions of this nature is discussed by Lord Lloyd in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 15th June. 3 „ It is perhaps, orima facie , not very likely that the King of Egypt would be able to make very much anti-British capital out of an endeavour to accommodate matters between Ibn Saud and himself, and while a section of Indian Mohamedanism no doubt regards Ibn Saud with strong dislike on religious grounds, the establishment of friendly relations between two of the principal Xohamedan States existing at the present time seems an ideal for working towards which it would be/be difficult, on a broad view, effectively to criticise His Majesty’s Government. I suggest, therefore, that we might express our general concurrence in the line proposed to be taken by the Foreign Office; but in view of the Moslem point it will perhaps be desirable before replying to them to consult the Government of India, and I suggest a draft telegram. /f-T'Draft Paper. puc,'4 '7 Department.

It is true that the G-overnment of India recently sold him some much needed arms and ammunition, and that we are now doing our best to help him with his Air Force, though it is too early C (P 3 3 5- S-) printed letter No. E 1477/1477/91 a copy of a telegram from the High Commissioner for Egypt regarding the' P l) 6 / ^ will see that in his despatch No. 547 of June 15, J.Gr. Laithwaite, Esq,., to/(g) to say whether we shall be able to do much for him on the latter point. We feel, however, that the more we can do for Ibn Saud the better, and it would certainly be very useful politically if we could be instrumental in securing his recognition by the King of Egypt. We are inclined to think also that King Fuad might be persuaded to give way on this point, though very reluctantly, if we were to press him seriously. We propose therefore in the first place to take an early opportunity of sounding the Egyptian Prime Minister confidentially and unofficially on the subjectJ we have reason to know that so far as he personally is concerned he is in favour of recognition: but before we go any further we should like to know whether you agree with our view on the general question of policy involved, and to hear any observations your department may have to offer. Dealings with King Fuad are sometimes apt to prove unexpectedly complicated, and lord Lloyd as you will see on page 3 of his despatch, thinks it possible that the King might try to exploit the religious aspect of the question and /and represent us as interfering unjustifiably in a matter of purely Moslem concern. I am sending a similar letter to Beckett at the Colonial Office. We should he very glad to have your views as soon as possible.5HK 8SSID3H0Y, CAIRO, 15th, June, 1929. Sir With roferenoe to Cir Austen Chamberlain’s despatoh No. 451 (S 2326/2137/91) of the 14th. ultimo and previous oorrespendenoe on the «ub^eot, I have the honour to suggest that the time has now oome for seriously considering whether it would not be advantageous for His Majesty’s Government to use pressure to secure the recognition of Ibn Baud by the Egyptian Government. 2. As you are aware, the failure of hgypt to recognise Ibn Baud has, for the last three years, caused a great deal of trouble to all concerned. Ibn Baud has naturally been annoyed by this attitude of Kgypt and has finally retaliated by refusing to admit that the Egyptian Consul at Jeddah is competent to perforin various functions (among which the moat important are of the notarial order) normally exor cised by a Consul officially recognised. She Egyptian Government has always ignored Fosan-aa-Sabi^, Xbn Baud’s representative at G&amp;iro. Hafes vVahba has. on bejialf of his master, frequently invoked my assistance to secure Egyptian recognition of Ibn Baud, and he has now taken the matter up in London. 3. I have on various occasions spoken to successive Egyptian Prim© ministers and ministers for Poreigc Affairs ..♦. The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, il.P., etc., etc.. etc.Affaire on the subject and generally Goand that I was knocking at an open door. Although oiahraal inci dents have occasionally influenced responsible Egypt ians against recognition, it may be said that despite suoh slight fluctuations of opinion, the Egyptian Government and most responsible Egyptians have gener ally been in favour of recognising Ibn Saud and putting an end to a strained situation which is felt to be mutu ally disadvantageous to two neighbouring Moslem States. 4. However, king ^uad, with whom X have also spoken on the subject, has taken up a decided attitude and absolutely opposes recognition of Ibn Saud. His Majesty first based hie opposition on t?ie ^aha&amp;l incident and subsequently on a general disapproval of Wahhibisa. He maintains that the Holy rl&amp;eea should not be in control of sectarians whose attitude is disapproved of by Moslems I generally. Eis own Caliphate ambitions and his desire to play a part in Arabia are not without influence on His Majesty^ attitude in this question. 5. hing Fuad*s recent manoeuvres in connection with the Yemen (see correspondence ending with my despatch Mo. 497 of June 6th.) are not without bearing on the question now under consideration. It would be moat invidious if, owing to king Quad's initiative, friendly relatione were establianed between gypt and the Yemen while Ibn Saud remains unrecognised by the gypti&amp;n Government. Obviously it would be no use making any representations to the Egyptian Government. The Ministers have too many difficulties with the King to go out of their*9 their way to quarrel with hi* over a matter of no direct significance &amp;a regards their own political fortunes* It would be necessary to take the matter up direct with hing Fuad, and probably strong rep resentations would oe required, for his majesty is exceedingly obstinate in this matter. He might aleo make mischief for us by misrepresenting any ouch action aa unjustifiable interference in a purely hoslem concern* 6* Ibn baud's present attitude towards His iajesty’s Government and Iraq is, 1 understand, on the whole satisfactory. He is evidently anxious to keep on friendly terms with us, hut he has frequently complained that in return for his persistent friendliness in the face of great difficulties he has recently got from us little more than expressions of cordiality. It is un desirable that he should be left under this impression, for he might be tempted to turn for assistance to the Bolsheviks, who are displaying considerable activity in Arabia. X tfould invite in this connection a reference to my despatch ho. 416 of June 6th. regarding the mission of Shekib Arslan to Ibn baud. It would seem, therefore, that anything we can do to help Ibn Saud at the present moment would be politically auvantageous, # loner for Iraq would endorse my view. If Iba -^aud sees that we can be useful as well aa formidable, he will perhaps be inclined to attach more importance to the maintenance of a long friendship. There is no doubt and I think it likely, moreover, that the High Commies- thatthat his recognition by aigypt will give him muoh moral satisfaction, and if it were obtained through our good offices, it would react advantageously as regards our influence over him* 7. If it is desired to tefce any action in this sense, 1 would suggest that the most convenient opportunity would be when King ?uad is In London. His 'iajesty would probably listen more patiently to representations made to him at a moment when he would be anxious to create a good impression. I have the honour to be, t/ith the highest respect. Sir, four most obedient, humble servant. KIGH OaaiSSIOH‘:R.Ko. 451. (^2326/2137/91) PORSIGU GPFICS, 3. .7.1. 14th May, 1929 © My Lord, O /Kith reference to your telegram ITo. 153 of April 26th, I have to inform Your Lordship that Sheikh Hafiz .fefrba called at the Foreign Office on May 7th. 2. After some general conversation, the Sheikh remarked that there were two points which he desired to mention: ( 1 ) the action of king Fuad in making a donation, or at any rate £5,000. in ordering a remittance, to Jerusalem of five thousand pounds from funds which should have teen devoted to the Holy Places, and (2) the persistent refusal of His Majesty to recognise the new status of Itn Saud in the Hejaz since his conquest of that country. 3. The first of these points, he said, he had already mentioned to Your Lordship, who had advised him to raise it when he came to England. In reply it was explained to the Sheikh that King Fuad.'a behaviour in this matter appeared to be a matter of a domestic nature, Hafiz Wahba added that one cause of his anxiety was that this action established a bad precedent. 4, With regard to the second point, the Sheikh remarked tnat there were rumours in Egypt that King Fuad's refusal to recognise was due to the attitude of His Majesty’s Grovernment. The Sheikh was reminded of the fact that His Majesty’s Grovernment had been one of the first to recognise Ibn Saud as King of the Hejaz, and that it was incredible that such a Bazaar rumour should find credence. Hafiz Wahba at/ Lord Lloyd, Gr.C.S.I, ,G*C.I.E. , etc., etc., etc. Cairo.at once replied that neither Ibn 3aud nor himself believed it. He then remarked that Your Lordship, the majority of the Egyptian Government, and others were in favour of the recognition of Ibn Saud, and that, in his opinion such recognition might be secured if His Majesty's Government were to take a favourable opportunity to let King Euad know that they desired it. The Sheikh was informed that this suggestion required consideration, 5, A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Acting British Agent and Consul at Jeddah, I am etc,, (Sd) G.W. Rendel.

The latter retaliated by refusing to admit official status of Egyptian consul especially in connexion with service of judicial documents unless Egypt would accord similar status to the Hejaz agent in Cairo whom Egyptian government ignore. Finally Hafez Wahba proposed question of formal status should be left in abeyance until atmosphere became clearer but that meanwhile Egyptian consul in Jeddah and Hejaz representative in Cairo should be allowed to treat with Hejaz and Egyptian authorities on all the usual matters v/ithout having the status formally conferred. This offer recognised by Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as reasonable has been rejected by the King of Egypt who now persists in withdrawing acting Egyptian consul from Jeddah on the ground that he may be exposed to an affront in view of present strained relations. Ministry of Foreign Affairs states withdrawal will be effected unobtrusively e.g. acting consul will be transferred elsewhere and not replaced consulate being left in the care of an archivist.

Your ^jesty the kingdom }ou established in Arabia is based on religion and leligion is the foundation of nations, especially in Arabia and amongst the Arabs’who cannot use except through religion. There is no doubt that the kingdom your Maiestv has established in the Arabian Peninsula, protected by religion and^Wd by the l_o 11 n— 1 J Jr* power of nationality, is thus a mighty country. We consider that this young country in the Arabian Peninsula is but the beginning of an era of deliverance for the Arabs and the Moslems, and of their freedom from weakness and subjection. The rough nation of the Arabian Peninsula is the one which will carry the message once more to the civilised countries to save them from the depths of abasement. Whatever differences may exist on their points of view between the Moslems, the political hopes in their hearts and in those of the Arabs are centred in this )oun°*-- countrv under your Majesty. Thus, although there is a small difference of opinion between us, let us suppose that the other side is in the right, for we ought to admit everything to your Majesty because the hopes of the Moslems and of the Arabs are laid on you, and because that peninsula, whose population is about 10 millions, is the one which will make those hopes a reality. We trust that the former position may be restored, and that Egypt will again have its share in the making of the Holy Cover. The difference in views about such a matter should not be a cause for separation between Egypt and the Hejaz. The result of such a dispute would only be to give the stranger an opportunity to have power over us. Your Majesty, I am a man who is known to have mixed with the people, and I am therefore qualified to judge the spirit of the Egyptian people. I can assure your Majesty that the Egyptians are glad because of your noble actions, and that a small difference of opinion will in no way affect the love which the Egyptians bear to you. It gives us pleasure to note that for the first time in history the Hejaz has woven a cover for the Kaaba, although to the loss of the Egyptians. We are glad because this action proves that the Arabs can do in one year what others could not do in many. The Powers know that the Arab nation is one body in which every member can replace the other, and that all work in harmony together.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] EASTERN (Arabia).

I HAVE the honour to report that Haroun Bey Selim Abou Sahla, Governor of Suez, Hamed-el-Bassel Pasha, Vice-President of the Wafd, and Abdurrahman Azzam, a Deputy of the left wing of the Wafd, are proceeding on the 21st instant to Jeddah for the pilgrimage. 2. Haroun Bey Selim is no friend of the Wafd, and his pilgrimage has probably no special significance. It is, however, difficult to believe that the other two are solely concerned with the religious aspect of the pilgrimage. It is presumed that they have been charged by the Prime Minister to engage unofficial conversations with Ibn Saud, in the hope of finding a basis for the settlement of outstanding questions such as the Mahmal and the recognition of Ibn Saud by Egypt. They have no doubt been selected because they are both Arabs. 3. The Egyptian Government has delegated Kamal-el-Kheshen Bey, Director of Works in the Ministry of Communications, Hamed Shaker Bey, an official of the Ministry of Wakfs, and Ali Hassan Bey, Director of the Service of Buildings in the Ministry of Public Works, to investigate the possibilities of certain urban improve ments in the Hejaz, including the utilisation of Ain Zobeida for the water supply of Mecca. I understand that this mission was arranged between Ibn Saud and the Egyptian consul at Jeddah, who apparently took the initiative in the matter. 4. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s agent and consul at Jeddah, who, perhaps, can obtain some information regarding the activities of these two missions in the Hejaz.

Jeddah Report for the Period January 1 to 31, 1928. NEJD-IRAQ relations have continued to furnish the subject-matter of leading articles in the press. The breach of the Uqair protocol is still insisted on; Iraq is accused, moreover, of having harboured Nejdi criminals convicted of raids on Iraq^ Yusuf-es-Sadun and Mohammed-el-Turki are cited as examples of Nejdi laiders who took refuge in Iraq to escape just punishment by Ibn Sand. 2 In the matter of the frontier incidents, public opinion may be divided m o three camps : the pro-Saud element holds that Feisal-el-Derweish acted in direct onposition P to Ibn Saud’s wishes and instructions. A small anti-Saud part) beheves the*raids to have been undertaken at the King's instigation; this party argues that Ibn Saud's policy has ever been to send out unofficial raiding parties, and to take credit for the result or to disclaim responsibility, according to the exigencies of the moment. The third view, which is current with a very small minority is that the events were engineered by His Majesty's Government m their own interests The arguments are far-fetched but ingenious. His Majesty s Government expected difficulty in persuading Iraq to ratify a treaty whereunder military control of the country’remained in British hands, they therefore required proof that the security of Iraq depended on the presence of British forces; they caused a post to be built at Busaiyah knowing that this would provoke an attack—to be repulsed b\ British ar ™ M ■ , s Hi h Commissioner for Iraq has reported that a meeting was to take place in the last week of this month between Ibn Saud and Feisal-el-Derweish in toe 6 presence of the ulema of Nejd. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has no confirmation, but considers it natural tha |;, F yf'- el -^7 e, f h sh0uld be Ca 6 UP ° n to answer for his actions before the assembled body of the ulema. answer ^ ^ of ^ Ikhwan receI ,t]v arrived in Mecca from Neid Pnmm.rs had been current in Nejd of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to build a railway from Jeddah to Mecca and from Mecca to Medina. Ibn Saud, to prove the rumours false invited this party to visit Mecca. The new road from Jeddah to Mecca proved to have given rise to their suspicions The Emir Feisal accompanied the rarty to a point where the work is nearing completion and explained that what they saw was a motor road and not a track on which railway lines could or would b6 la 5 d ' The road is not making the hoped-for progress. The weight of the steam- rnller is blamed for the present somewhat unsatisfactory results, though the genuineness of this excuse is largely discounted by the fact that those employing it are commercially interested in the import of a lighter type of roller. There are two admirable reasons for the poor surface of the new road : Suleiman Pasha, ex-Turkish Minister for War, who is in charge of the work, has probably a good working f371 dd—2]'1 knowledge of military matters, but knows nothing of road-making. Raghama, where the roller is now working, is 8 miles from Jeddah, the nearest point from which water is obtainable; there are three small water-carts (tanks mounted on Ford chassis), but the supply so transported falls far short of requirements. 6. The Italian consul, finding that the negotiations which he has been conducting by correspondence with Ibn Baud relative to Italian recognition ar^^ leading to no useful result, has suggested to his Government that he should awas the return of the King to the Hejaz before making any further proposals. I gather that my colleague has been authorised to offer recognition to Ibn Baud as King of the Hejaz, Nejd and their Dependencies, Asir not to be mentioned specifically, but a separate unpublished note to be addressed to Ibn Baud stating that Italy has no knowledge of the Treaty of Mecca. A simple acknowledgment of this letter would satisfy the Italians. Ibn Baud, however, wished to be recognised by Italy as other Powers have recognised him, namely, as King of the Hejaz, Nejd and their Dependencies. The Italians may make what mental reservations they wish, but he, Ibn Baud, cannot take cognisance of the reservations. Were he to do so, he would be weakening his position in Asir vis-a-vis the Imam. It is difficult at present to conceive of a formula satisfactory to Ibn Baud and the Italian Government which does not at the same time offend the Imam, though Dr. Cesano still hopes that in private conversation with the King he will succeed where correspondence has failed. 7. The new coins struck by the mint, Birmingham, are now T in circulation. They are to be known as “ Arab ” dollars, half-dollars, quarter-dollars and piastres. The £ sterling remains the basis of exchange, which is fixed at 10 dollars or 220 piastres to the £. The coins are not inartistic. If they are circulated in sufficient numbers to meet local requirements during the pilgrimage season, exchange should remain more stable than in previous years, w^hen a shortage has regularly resulted in an appreciable rise in the exchange value of the silver currency. 8. There is, with the increase of commercial activity consequent on the greater influx of pilgrims, a growing need for properly established courts of justice. At present the only courts in existence are the Shariah Courts, which administer justice based on the precepts of the Koran. There is naturally no provision for the settlement of questions relating to goods on consignment, drafts, bills and indeed any normal modern commercial operations. Many such operations are, in fact, definitely illegal by Shariah law. Certain cases can, it is true, at the demand of both parties be settled by the Mejlis-ul-Tujjar, but there is often one party which sees advantage in obtaining a judgment in the Shariah Court. Moreover, the decision of the Mejlis-ul-Tujjar is not final—appeal to the Shariah Court at Mecca is possible to either party, and the case is once again tried by religious law. If there are no law 7 courts, there are no lawyers, and consequently little litigation. Cases between Europeans or foreign-protected persons are almost invariably settled by arbitration by the respective consuls of the parties concerned. 9. Another result of the increased commercial activity in the Hejaz is the pressing need for new houses. Rents are being raised annually, but are still not sufficiently high to induce local capitalists to build. The population of Jeddah is increasing rapidly, but there is practically no room wdthin the city walls for expansion. If security continues a time will soon come when a new residential quarter must be started outside the city walls. 10. The pilgrimage season may now be said to have started. More than 30,000 pilgrims have already arrived from overseas, mostly from Batavia and Singapore. Four Indian pilgrim ships have already arrived, bringing 1,272 pilgrims; two more are expected in the first days of February. It is generally hoped that the pilgrimage from India will be slightly larger than last year; this increase will, however, be discounted by a falling oft in the number of Malays. There is as yet no indication of the numbers likely to proceed from Persia or North Africa. The total pilgrimage from overseas is expected to reach 150,000, an increase of some 10 per cent, on last year’s total. 11. Cars are being introduced in such numbers that the Government has decided to limit the import. All cars already on order may be imported, but thereafter every fresh order must first be officially sanctioned and an import licence obtained. This new restriction is introduced ostensibly in the interests of all car owners. There are already some 500 cars registered for the pilgrimage traffic. Competition is so strong that cars are in most cases running at a loss. The Govern ment rate for the return journey—Jeddah-Medina—is £15, of which £6 represents Government tax. Owners are accepting as low a fare as £10. The Government has raised the tax on camel hire without raising the fares themselves. Fodder has3 increased in price. The result was a strike of camelmen at Medina. The rivalry between car and camel and between the motor companies will certainly react in tavour ot the pilgrim in ensuring him cheap fares, but the Hejaz will sufi'er. Last year the Hejaz was the car owner’s paradise. This year it is a chauffeur’s paradise. Last year s experience taught the wisdom of securing the services of reliable ^Hiauffeur-mechanics. Fifteen pounds a month can now be claimed by an efficient ^pfechanic. 12. As cases of plague were reported both in Egypt and at Aden, several ships were quarantined during the month. All coolies who have been on board a ship not out of quarantine are sent to the quarantine island for five days. They demand and receive from the shipping agents full pay for the whole period of their stay on the island, in spite of the fact that in most cases they could have earned nothing during that period. The Government has ordered from Egypt sufficient anti-plague serum for the inoculation of 10,000 persons. The Dutch bacteriologist continues his work under most difficult conditions. On a recent occasion he left his Syrian assistant in charge of the vaccination of babies. On his return he found the Syrian smoking a cigarette upstairs and a large buck nigger engaged in the work of vaccinating one patient after another without changing, sterilising or even wiping the needle. Dr. van der Hoog wonders in face of such doings whether his work will result in the prevention or the spread of disease. He is seriously considering the advisability of embracing Islam, feeling that unless he can visit Mecca and Medina his work can be of little real value. He has great hopes of interesting American philanthropists in his work and of building a large modern hospital staffed by American trained assistants. He would like to see the hospital so established controlled by a committee of three of the consuls of the Powers represented at Jeddah. He would probably have more success in interesting America than in inducing the Government to agree to any such foreign control. 13. Amin Tewfik, the Egyptian consul at Jeddah, left for Cairo on the 15th. He was deservedly popular with the European colony and with the Hejaz authorities. Though not of great experience, he handled the many delicate questions which fell to him to negotiate with considerable tact. I learn unofficially and privately that his successor, Said Bey, late consul at Jerusalem, is out of favour with the Egyptian Foreign Office and is being sent to Jeddah as a punishment. This is difficult to believe as relations between the Hejaz and Egypt are such that a tactless or incompetent representative could cause much friction. 14. Khakimoff, the Soviet representative, arrived at Jeddah on the 21st instant. He left here in September last in a very poor state of health, and was undergoing treatment in Europe when recalled to his post. The Tomp incident, to which reference was made in the Jeddah report for November last, provoked his recall. It was felt that Tumetoff, the Charge d’Affaires in Khakimoff’s absence, had mishandled the situation. Tumetoff twice went to Mecca just before his chief’s arrival to press the authorities to accord a ceremonial reception to Khakimoff on landing at Jeddah. Dr. Damluji refused on the score that it is customary throughout the world to welcome foreign representatives with pomp and ceremony only on first arrival and on final departure. Khakimoff on arrival has opened his heart to the Italian consul; he is very bitter against His Majesty’s Government, who, he says, have persistently sought to discredit the Soviet regime by the production and publication of falsified documents. 15. Shipping statistics recently prepared for the Board of Trade show that 223 British ships visited Jeddah in 1927 as against 170 in 1926. The respective tonnages for the two years were as follows :— 1926 1927 351,486 572.001 The increase is due entirely to the increase in size of the pilgrimage, which resulted not only in the visits of more pilgrim ships but in increased imports. 16i The number of slaves manumitted and repatriated during the month was three.
