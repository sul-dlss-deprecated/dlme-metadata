The foliation sequence commences at the front cover of volume one (ff 1-253) and terminates at the inside back cover of volume two (ff 254-274); these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. An additional irregular foliation sequence is present in parallel; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is present between ff 122-274 and is circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence relating to the initiation of operations to extract sulphur in Kuwait. The papers primarily discuss logistical and legal arrangements coordinated between the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, the Political Agent in Kuwait, and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. A separately bound section of the file entitled 'part two' is a draft agreement written in English and Arabic on the sulphur extraction project prepared for review by the Ruler of Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Contract law</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Gulf Oil Corporation</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Sulphur</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00010f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00010f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00010f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00010f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00010f#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
