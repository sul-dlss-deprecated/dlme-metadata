I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to ^tate, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that he considers it desirable that the Government of India, in view of their participation in the Umpire Air Mail Scheme, should now be advised of the effect of the British Overseas Airways Act, 1959, which received the Royal Assent on 4th August, 1939, and of which a copy is enclosed for transmission to the Government of India. (it is regretted that King’s Printer’ copies of the British Overseas Airv/ays Act are not yet available, out the enclosed copies of the Bill as introduced in the House of Lords have been brought up to date by the insertion of all the amendments made subsequently). 2. Under that- Act the undertaking of Imperial Airways, Ltd. by Y/hom the Empire Air Mail Scheme is at present operated, is to be transferred, from an 'appointed day' in the near future, to a new statutory corporation to be called 'British Overseas Airways Corporation'. Under Section 10 of the Act, contracts between the Secretary of State for Air and the company will be terminated from the 'appointed day' but contracts between His Majesty’s Postmaster-General and the company will continue, with the substitution of the Corporation for the Company. The Empire Agreement is one of the agreements which will be so terminated in so far as contract between the Secretary of State for Air and the company is concerned. It is nevertheless intended that the services for which the Empire Agreement provides shall be continued and developed, and it is hoped that the effect of the revised arrangements, when fully operative, will be such that participating Governments will receive, not merely services as good as would have been the case if the Empire Agreement had remained in force, but services improved to an extent which would have been impracticable so Ion as they were in the hands of a commercial company operating under a subsidy agreement. 3. It will be observed that the financial arrangements which are contemplated between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the new Corporation will differ in form from those which have existed in the past between that Government and Imperial Airways, Ltd. Payments from the United Kingdom Exchequer will no longer take the form of subsidies related to specified services, but of grants related to the excess of estimated expenditure over estimated revenue on an approved programme, normally covering three years, of all air transport services and other activities to be undertaken by the Corporation. 4. In connection with the participation of India in the Empire Air Mail Scheme, the Government of India have agreed to make contributions to subsidy in addition to payments for the carriage of mail, have granted relief from landing charges and from taxation on fuel and oil, and have arranged for the provision and maintenance of certain ground organisation within India. Sir Kimgsley Wood would be grateful if the Marquess of Zetland would invite the Government of India to indicate rheir willingness to continue subsidy payments on the agreed scale and to continue to provide facilities and benefits similar to those at present enjoyed by Imperial Airv/ays, Ltd. and its subsidiary and associated companies.

INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES TRANSIT AGREEMENT ^ International Air Services Transit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Appendix III. INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT AGREEMENT International Air Transport Agreement, which is attached hereto as Appendix IV. ine lollowmg resolutions and recommendations were adopted: I PREPARATION OF THE FINAL ACT The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the Secretariat be authorized to prepare the Final Act in accordance with the suggestions proposed by the Secretary-General in Journal No. ^54 December 4, 1944, and that the Co-ordinating Committee review the text; T hat the Final Act contain the definitive texts of the instruments formulated ,t y tL e T7 COn i fe of nCe m c P lenar y session ’ and that no changes be made therein at the Pinal Plenary Session. II Whereas : DRAFT TECHNICAL ANNEXES . The lar g e st possible degree of international standardization of practice m jnany matters is important to safe, expeditious, and easy air navigation; Whereas : These matters typically involve problems of great variety and complexity and require that much new ground be explored; and Whereas : Considerable progress has been made, during the discussions of the present Conference m the development of codes of practice agreed upon as proper to^ limited hn pnH n +h PartlC1 vl tmg f m the dl 1 SCUSSlons ’ but the time has been i! f d , ? the num her of personnel able to participate directly too small, to permit carrying the discussions to final conviction of the adequacy or correctness of certain of the determinations here made; . y i. fT) in the minutes and of the AVIATION hereto hereto as hereto as hereto as in accordance No. 34, the text; formulated made therein of practice navigation; complexity, of the present as proper has been directly too the adequacy 13 The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the drafts of annexes for an international civil aviation convention, which are attached hereto as Appendix V,^) be accepted by the Conference, upon the bases that: ' (a) The drafts as now presented shall be accepted by the participating States for immediate and continuing study; (b) They shall be accepted as constituting models of the desirable scope and arrangement of the several annexes; (c) The participating States undertake to forward to the Government of the United States (or to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization if it shall in the meantime have been established), by May 1, 1945, any recommendations which they may have for necessary additions, deletions, or amendments; —^ (d) The Government of the United States (or the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization) will transmit such suggestions to the other participating States in anticipation of meetings of the technical committees to be established by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organiza tion for dealing with the subject matter of the various documents, such meetings to be held as soon as practicable thereafter for the purpose of ultimate acceptance of the annexes in final form for attachment to a convention. (e) Meanwhile, in so far as the Technical Subcommittees have been able to agree on recommended practices, the States of the world, bearing in mind their present international obligations, are urged to accept these practices as ones toward which the national practices of the several States should be directed as far and as rapidly as may prove practicable. III TECHNICAL PERSONNEL Whereas : The development and maintenance of suitable international standards in matters relating to international air navigation will require constant analysis, by technically qualified personnel, of the development of the pertinent arts and of the various practices existing with respect thereto; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, as soon ^fcs possible after its organization, should employ in its Secretariat a suitable oody of personnel, expert in the fields of aeronautical science and practice in which continuing study will be particularly needed; and that such technically qualified members of the Secretariat should be charged to analyze and report to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization on problems relating to the drafting of international standards and recommended practices and to conduct and report on such other studies as will promote the safe and efficient conduct of international air transportation. IV METRIC SYSTEM Whereas : A standard system of measurements in all rules and regulations pertaining to air traffic on international and intercontinental airways would greatly con tribute to the safety of these operations; and ( x ) See note on page 1.14 Whereas : It is considered of high importance that figures used in rules and regulations and other data, with which air crews and other operational personnel have to deal in the preparation of and during flights over various countries, should consist of round figures which can easily be remembered; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: 1. That in those cases in which it appears impracticable or undesirable to make use of the metric system as a primary international standard, units in publications and codes of practice directly affecting international air navi gation should be expressed both in the metric and English systems; and 2. That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization shall make further unification of numbering and systems of dimensioning and specificatiMi of dimensions used in connection with international air navigation the subj(^^ of continuing study and recommendation. V TRANSFER OF TITLE TO AIRCRAFT Considering ; That the sale of aircraft to be used in international operations will render it desirable for the various governments to reach a common understanding on the legal questions involved in the transfer of title: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the early calling of an international confer ence on private international air law for the purpose of adopting a convention dealing with the transfer of title to aircraft and that such private air law conference include in the bases of discussions: {a) The existing draft convention relating to mortgages, other real securi ties, and aerial privileges; and (b) The existing draft convention on the ownership of aircraft and the aeronautic register, both of which were adopted by the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA) in 1931. VI ROME CONVENTION (MAY 29, 1933)( 2 ) RELATING TO THE PRECAUTIONARY ATTACHMENT OF AIRCRAFT Considering : That the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce is essential in order that the fullest advantage may be derived from the rapid means of communication afforded by aircraft; That the seizure or detention of aircraft where the attaching creditor cannot invoke a judgment and execution obtained beforehand in the ordinary course of procedure, or an equivalent right of execution, affects the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce; The International Civil Aviation Conference ( 2 ) “League of Nations Treaty Series ” No. 4479 (not ratified by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom).15 Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of ratifying or adhering to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Precautionary Attachment of Aircraft, signed at Rome on May 29, 1933, during the Third International Conference on Private Air Law, in so far as such governments have not already ratified or adhered to that Convention. VII RESUMPTION OF AND CO-ORDINATION WITH THE SESSIONS OF CITEJA Considering: That the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens &gt;*ITEJA), created pursuant to a recommendation adopted at the First Inter actional Conference on Private Air Law held at Paris in 1925, has made considerable progress in the development of a code of private international air law through the preparation of draft international conventions for final adoption at periodic international conferences on private air law; That the further elaboration of this code of private international air law through the completion of pending CITEJA projects and the initiation of new studies in the field of private air law will contribute materially to the development of international civil aviation: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of bringing about the resumption at the earliest possible date of the CITEJA sessions which were suspended because of the outbreak of war, of making necessary con tributions toward the expenses of the Secretariat of CITEJA, and of appoint ing legal experts to attend the CITEJA meetings; and 2. That consideration also be given by the various governments to the desirability of co-ordinating the activities of CITEJA with those of the Pro visional International Civil Aviation Organzation and, after it shall have come into existence, of the permanent International Civil Aviation Organiza tion established pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7th, 1944. VIII. STANDARD FORM OF AGREEMENT FOR PROVISIONAL AIR ROUTES Whereas : The course of military events will free certain areas of the world from the interruption which the war has caused to civil air traffic; Whereas : The civil transport systems and facilities of many States have been reduced to a level which is far from adequate, but on the other hand there exist wide opportunities for utilizing the airplane, which has demonstrated its efficiency in rendering rapid transportation on a large scale basis, in bringing aid to needy countries and in hastening the return of normal trade and commerce; 4 i2 35 A 5i6 Whereas : The possibilities of air transportation are so great and at the same time so unpredictable, that it is desirable to promote early development in this field during a transitional period, in order to obtain practical experience for giving effect to more permanent arrangements at a later date; Whereas : Every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory; and Whereas : It is desirable that there should be as great a measure of uniformity as possible in any agreements that may be made between States for the operation of air services; Recommends : The International Civil Aviation Conference 1. That each State^undertake to refrain from including specific provisions in an agreement which grant exclusive rights of transit, non-traffic stop, and commercial entry to any other State or airline, or from making any agreement excluding or discriminating against the airlines of any State, and will terminate any existing exclusive or discriminatory rights as soon as such action can be taken under presently outstanding agreements; 2. That the clauses contained in the draft form of standard agreement hereinafter set out shall be regarded as standard clauses for incorporation in the agreements referred to above, it being understood that the right is reserved to the States concerned to effect such changes of wording as may be necessary in the particular case and to add additional clauses so long as such changes or additions are not inconsistent with the standard clauses, it being further understood that nothing herein shall prevent any State from entering into agreements with airlines of other States provided that such agreements shall incorporate the aforementioned standard clauses to the extent that these may be applicable: Form of Standard Agreement for Provisional Air Routes (1) The contracting parties grant the rights specified in the Annex* hereto necessary for establishing the international civil air routes and services therein described, whether such services be inaugurated immediately or ait a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted. (2) (a) Each of the air services so described shall be placed in operaticp^ as soon as the contracting party to whom the right has been granted t paragraph (1) to designate an airline or airlines for the route concerned has authorized an airline for such route', and the contracting party granting the right shall, subject to Article (7) hereof, be bound to give the appropriate operating permission to the airline or airlines concerned; provided that the airline so designated may be required to qualify before the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party granting the rights under the laws and regulations normally applied by these authorities before being per mitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this Agreement; and * An Annex will include a description of the routes and of the rights granted whether of transit onlv, of non-traffic stops or of commercial entry as the case may be, and the conditions incidental to the granting of the rights. Where rights of non-traffic stops or commercial rights are granted, the Annex will include a designation of the ports of call at which stops can be made, or at which commercial rights for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, cargo and mail are authorized, and a statement of the contracting parties to whom the respective rights are granted.17 provided that in areas of hostilities or of military occupation, or in areas affected thereby, such inauguration shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities. (b) It is understood that any contracting party granted commercial rights under this Agreement should exercise them at the earhest practicable date except in the case of temporary inability to do so. ( 3 ) Operating rights which may have been granted previously by any of the contracting parties to any State not a party to this Agreement or to an airline shall continue in force according to their terms. (4) In order to prevent discriminatory practices and to assure equality of treatment, it is agreed that: (a) Each of the contracting parties may impose or permit to be imposed just and reasonable charges for the use of airports, and other facilities. Each of the contracting parties agrees, however, that these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services. (b) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into the territory of a contracting party by another contracting party or its nationals, and intended solely for use by aircraft of such other contracting party shall be accorded national and most-favoured-nation treatment with respect to the im position of customs duties, inspection fees or other national duties or charges by the contracting party whose territory is entered. (c) The fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and air craft stores retained on board civil aircraft of the airlines of the contracting parties authorized to operate the routes and services described in the Annex shall, upon arriving in or leaving the territory of other contracting parties, be exempt from customs, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used or consumed by such aircraft on flights in that territory. • (5) Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting parties, for the purpose of operating the routes and services described in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight above its own terri tory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. (6) (a) The laws and regulations of a contracting party relating to the ^^.mission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international .r navigation, or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall be applied to the aircraft of all contracting parties without distinction as to nationality, 'and shall be complied with by such aircraft upon entering or departing from or while within the territory of that party. (b) The laws and regulations of a contracting party as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew, or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew, or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within, the territory of that party. (7) Each contracting party reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certifi cate or permit to an airline of another State in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a party to this Agreement, or in case of failure of an airline to comply with the laws of the State over which it operates, as described in Article (6) hereof, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement. A 6 4 I2 35i8 (8) This Agreement and all contracts connected therewith, shall be regis tered with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization. (9) [Where desired, here insert provisions for arbitration, the details of which will be a matter for negotiation between the parties to each agreement.] (10) This Agreement shall continue in force until such time as it may be amended, or superseded by a general multilateral air convention, provided, however, that the rights for services granted under this Agreement may be terminated by giving one year’s notice to the contracting party whose air lines are concerned. Such notice may be given at any time after a period of two months to allow for consultation between the contracting party giving notice and the contracting parties served by the routes. IX FLIGHT DOCUMENTS AND FORMS The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, when estab lished, be requested to give consideration to the question of the publication of flight documents and forms in representative languages of areas through which major international air routes are operated.

In this Paper His Majesty’s Government present their general policy for the development of British civil air transport and the operation of air routes for the carriage of passengers, freight and mails. 2 . In determining policy the field of civil aviation must be viewed as a whole and a plan, to be effective and practical, must cover all routes in which the United Kingdom is interested—Commonwealth, foreign and internal. 3. The United Kingdom policy on air transport in the international sphere, as set out in the White Paper on “ International Air Transport ” (Cmd. 6561) and elaborated in the United Kingdom proposals made at Chicago, was based upon the fundamental principle of order in the air, i.e.—the full and fair development of air services to meet all requirements coupled with the elimina*** tion of wasteful and subsidised competition. So too, our“ national policy, while it must stimulate and encourage development and initiative, should do so within an ordered plan. 4. Civil aviation is essentially a transport business. Its problems are in many vyays analogous to those of transport by land and by sea. To make our pational air services effective, we must not only draw upon the best of aviation knowledge and skill at our command, but must also make the fullest use of the ripe experience and world-wide organisation which has been built up over many years' by British enterprise and initiative in other forms of transport. This does not mean that His Majesty’s Government regard any industry or undertaking as having a vested right to share in civil air transport. 1 he test which has been applied in evolving the plan set out in this Paper is: Where can the best contribution to British air transport be obtained, and how can it most effectively be used to build up an organisation which will fulfil our public, commercial, and social needs? 5. It is fully recognised, not only by His Majesty's Government but also by those who are concerned in existing methods of transport by land and by sea, that the competition of air services must be met in the air. Our national and Commonwealth interests—and, indeed, the interests of the older forms of transport themselves—cannot be served by attempting to retard or restrict new methods of carriage. They can best be promoted by creating and fostering the most effective air transport system we can develop at home and overseas. 6 6. Air transport is a service in which the community as a whole has a dire interest. The criterion as to whether a particular route should be flown is not merely: Is it commercially profitable? There are services which are essential in the public interest, but which offer little or no prospect of a direct financial return. Unlimited competition in the air by private operators would mean that competing services would be concentrated on the remunerative routes, and that the taxpayer, while reaping no benefit from the more lucrative Tomes, would be compelled to support by subsidies those services which, although desirable for public or social reasons, would initially, at any rate, be run at a loss, and nrght, in some cases, never show a profit. On the other hand, if an air iiansport undertaking is assured of the exclusive right to operate a sufficient proportion of remunerative services and to develop these to the full, it can and should accept the obligation to run unremunera- hve services as part of its general transport system. It is, there- fore a necessary part of the Government’s plan, that the undertakings which will be granted the right to run air sendees both within the UnitedUMSPORT Air Transport. present their general policy for and the operation of air routes ails. aviation must be viewed as a l, must cover all routes in which vealth, foreign and internal. port in the international sphere, al Air Transport ” (Cmd. 6561) als made at Chicago, was based the air, i.e.—the full and fair ments coupled with the elimina^ So too, our“ national policy, pment and initiative, should do business.

It is, there- plan, that the undertakings ;rvices both within the United v Kingdom and between the United Kingdom and other countries, shall possess such right on their allotted routes, to the exclusion of other United K.ngdom air transport operators. 7. While in the interests of order and economy, competition between United Kingdom operators on individual air routes must be eliminated, there remains a field of development which is open to and will, in the Government’s view, be best served and stimulated by the entry of competing operators. Subject to the observance of the necessary safety and navigational requirements, it is not intended to restrict the operation of charter aircraft. Requisites of an Air Transport Organisation. 8. In the view of His Majesty’s Government, the following are the requisites of an efficient air transport organisation:— _ (a) The Units must be large enough to operate economically but not so large or widespread as to preclude effective supervision along every route. (h) Each Unit must have an efficient organisation covering every area served by its air lines to handle passengers, freight and mail, together with first class knowledge and experience of transportation and facilities for full co-operation with other forms of transport wherever this can promote air travel. (c) Provision must be made for the economical use and maintenance of aircraft. (d) The most effective arrangements must be made for the training of air crews and ground staff and for their welfare. (e) There must be close co-operation between the users and the manu facturers in deciding the types of aircraft to be used. (/) The organisation should be capable of providing training for the crews of Commonwealth or foreign countries, and should also be able to supply these countries, where required, with technical and operational help. 9. Size of Units. —The Governfnent are convinced that the policy of a single chosen instrument, whatever may have been its merits in the past, is unsuited to deal with the great expansion of the future. There must, there fore, be several air transport undertakings. A single entity, even if it could effectively include and use all the varied experience of aviation and trans portation which it is necessary to bring in, would be too large and far-flung A t o fulfil the requirement of individual supervision of all the routes operated. Aloreover, while as stated above, it is clearly desirable to eliminate wasteful competition between British operators on the same route, it is none the less desirable both to avoid a sealed pattern of management and operation and to encourage different managements to try out their own ideas. This would in no way prevent the constant pooling of experience and the Government’s plan is designed to secure this. 10. Civil Aviation as a Transport Problem .—Air transport can be greatly assisted and stimulated by co-operation with other systems of transport. To the solution of the problems which air transport poses British enterprises already engaged in other branches of the transport and travel business can, alike with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, bring a valuable contribution. Their extensive organisation and connections both in the United Kingdom and overseas can with great economy of management be used to serve air transoort equally with land and sea transport. Through their co operation, the fullest use can be made of through-bookings, interavailability4 of tickets between air and other forms of transport and the most convenient rail and sea connections on all parts of the air routes. It is therefore of the essence of the Government’s plan that those interests concerned in transport by sea and by land should be brought into a real and effective partnership with the organisations which will be responsible for transport by air. n. Carriage of Mails by Air. —The Government have a special interest in the carriage of mails by air. The Postmaster General is considering, in consultation with the Minister for Civil Aviation and the undertakings which will operate the future British air services, the best and fullest use which can be made of those services for the carriage of air mail. 12. Routes to be operated by Separate Units. —Much consideration has been given to the number of air transport units which will be most effective at the present stage, and the routes which they should cover. The Government have decided that the most efficient organisation will be obtained by means of three main Air Transport Corporations which will be responsible for air services op* the following routes: (1) The Commonwealth air routes together with the trans-Atlantic service to the United States and the services to China and the Far East. (2) European air routes and the internal services of the United Kingdom. (3) The South American route. 13. It is obviously convenient that the same Corporation which will operate the air route from the United Kingdom to Canada, should also operate the Atlantic service to the United States. When conditions permit the inaugu ration of regular civil air services to China and other parts of the Far East, these will link naturally with the services to India and Australia, and it is desirable that they should be associated with the same Corporation. 14. The Government are satisfied that the arguments in favour of uniting internal services of the United Kingdom and services from the United Kingdom to Europe in a single Corporation are overwhelming. While the majority of continental services will focus on London, connections will be required from the outset with other centres of population and industry in the United Kingdom; and, as air transport develops, services will run direct from some of these centres to the Continent. The same type of aircraft will be equally suitable for many of the European and internal services; and the economical use of such aircraft will be greatly increased if they can be drawn from a pool available for European and internal services in accordance with the fluctuating seasonal and other traffic demands on individual routes. I 5 - The trunk route from the United Kingdom to South America presenf^^ a new field for British civil aviation. It is one which our long and close relations with the States of that Continent make it essential that we should enter. The Structure of the Corporations. 16. Commonwealth routes (including the Atlantic) .—The Commonwealth and Alantic routes, together with the ultimate extensions to China and the Far East, will be assigned to the British Overseas Airways Corporation. This Corporation and their predecessor, Imperial Airways, have been responsible for the develop ment and operation of these routes in the past. They are in close relations with the corresponding operators of other Commonwealth countries. They are therefore clearly the appropriate instrument for the operation and further development of these routes. On many of the routes, however, a valuable contribution can be made by British Shipping Lines with their well-established organisation and local connections, and their experience of the special trans-5 .nsport and the most convenient ir routes. It is therefore of the interests concerned in transport a real and effective partnership e for transport by air. nment have a special interest in ister General is considering, in :ion and the undertakings which the best and fullest use which ie of air mail. s.—Much consideration has been lich will be most effective at the d cover.

They are for the operation and further he routes, however, a valuable Lines with their well-established experience of the special trans port requirements of particular areas served. It is therefore proposed that these Shipping Lines shall be afforded the opportunity of becoming associated with B.O.A.C. in the operation of those routes to which they can make a useful contribution; an association which is welcomed alike by B.O.A.C. and the Shipping Lines. It will probably be convenient, in any case, for B.O.A.C. to operate certain of these routes through subsidiary companies; and as the interest and organisation of the different Shipping Lines is confined to par ticular routes, such a structure will clearly be desirable for those services in which British Shipping Lines participate. In any subsidiary companies, the predominant financial and managerial interest will normally be held by B.O.A.C.; but the Shipping Lines will, at their own risk, take a share in the capital, and their transport experience and commercial acumen will be represented on the boards. It is the determination of all the Shipping Lines which have expressed a desire to participate, as it is of His Majesty’s ^^lovernment, that the air routes with which they are to be associated shall be fully and successfully developed. 17. European and Internal Routes .—An agreed schedule of European and Internal United Kingdom routes will be assigned to a new company in which the participants will be the Railway Companies, the Short Sea Shipping Lines, Travel Agencies and B.O.A.C. and such other pre-war operators as desire to participate. In the first four groups is concentrated a great wealth of British knowledge and experience of aviation, transport and travel problems. In addition to their knowledge of United Kingdom and European traffic needs and their extensive organisation here and on the Continent, the Railways and their associated air companies have, in the past, successfully operated the great majority of the internal air services of the United Kingdom. The Short Sea Shipping Lines operate and have built up a valuable organisation and goodwill in connection with sea routes to Europe; some of them have also been associated with the operation of air lines in the past. The Travel Agencies combine a peculiar knowledge of the needs oi the travelling and touring public with a wide organisation in this country and throughout the Continent. All the proposed participants are agreed on the importance of B.O.A.C. having its share in this Corporation. It will bring to it all its knowledge of aviation and its experience of the continental air-routes which its predecessors operated before the war. 18. Although the great majority of European and internal air services were previously operated by B.O.A.C., the Railway Companies or the Short ^ea Shipping Lines, there was a small number of independent British operators /ho ran air lines before the war. All but one of these have been compelled to cease operating during the war, but the Government considered it fair to afford them an opportunity of taking up shares in the new company on the same terms as the other participants. In certain cases these operators have acquired a knowledge and experience of particular local internal routes to be included in the agreed schedule, upon which it may be in the public interest to draw. Where the Government is satisfied that this is desirable, the possibility of forming companies subsidiary to the main Corporation to operate these routes, will not be excluded. In such a case the pre-war operator will be afforded an opportunity of participating in the capital of the sub sidiary company instead of or in addition to taking up shares in the new Corporation. 19. As stated in paragraph 6 it is an essential part ot the Government’s plan that the new Corporation shall be responsible for all the British air services on the scheduled routes. Its right to run on these routes within the United Kingdom will be exclusive. Its services to Europe will be run in parallel or, it is hoped, in some cases in conjunction with the services of other 4°773European countries to the United Kingdom. These exclusive rights are clearly necessary to give economical operation and the running of a maxi mum number of air services. The plan will, therefore, provide for the Corporation to run some services, both in the United Kingdom and in Europe, which will initially be run at a loss and some of which may never show a profit. Services of this kind are necessary in the public interest and a com prehensive schedule of services will be settled which will serve the public interest as well as fulfilling purely commercial traffic needs. 20. By bringing into the Corporation those interests which are concerned with land and sea travel in the United Kingdom and to Europe, arrangements will be made for interavailability of tickets for the different forms of travel on all stages of the routes, for the use of the existing offices and agencies of the various participants both at home and abroad, and for the most con venient adjustment of times and frequencies of services in the interest of ai^ travellers to facilitate through connections with other forms of transport. ^ 21. The European and internal air routes are likely to be more lucrative than some of the Commonwealth routes which are to be assigned to B.O.A.C. as the direct operating Corporation. The Government therefore think it right that the financial interest of B.O.A.C. in the new Corporation which will operate the European and internal air routes should be assessed in the light of this consideration as well as of the technical contribution which it can make to the new Corporation. While it is not proposed that B.O.A.C. should have a majority holding in the new Corporation, it is intended that its interest should be substantial. 22. South American Route .—The South American route will be assigned to a new company in which the majority participants will be those British Shipping Lines operating to South America who have associated together for this purpose as British Latin American Airlines Limited. Here again it is proposed that B.O.A.C. should participate in the capital and manage ment of the new Corporation, but its share in the capital will be smaller than that which it will receive in the Corporation responsible for the European and internal services. The British Shipping Lines which have for so many years carried a large proportion of the passengers and trade between Europe and South America and have their wide connections and organisation and their goodwill in the areas to be served by the new air route are, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, in the best position to make the service a success. They have expressed their willingness to risl^ their own capital in operating the route without subsidy. 23. Transfer of Shares in the Air Transport Corporations .—The transport and travel organisations which have been invited by the Government to participate in the new plan, have been selected by reason of the positive contribution which they can make in skill and experience to the new Cor porations. That they are prepared to invest their own money without any Government guarantee is an indication of their belief in the future of civil air transport and an earnest of their intention to operate efficiently; but they have not been invited merely as investors. They will take a permanent stake in the enterprise; and the Government has accordingly laid it down that there shall be no transfer of the shares in the capital of the new com panies which are allotted to the participants. This will apply not only to the two new main air transport Corporations but also to the subsidiary com panies which may be formed by B.O.A.C. to operate specific Commonwealth or Atlantic routes in which Shipping Lines may participate, and to any other subsidiary companies which may be formed by the other main air transport)m.

This will apply not only to 5 but also to the subsidiary com- o operate specific Commonwealth lay participate, and to any other by the other main air transport Corporations to operate particular services, such as those to the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, where constitutional or other considerations make the formation of subsidiary companies desirable. 24. Payment for Goodwill. —His Majesty’s Government do not regard anyone as having a vested interest in the air. Although the new air transport Corporations will be entitled to acquire at a fair valuation from existing air line operators any physical assets which are needed for the new services, the Government do not feel they would be justified in approving an allowance or issue of shares to participants in respect of goodwill or “ development expenses ” previously incurred. The whole of the capital of the new Corpora tions and their subsidiaries will thus be represented either by physical assets acquired or cash subscribed. Co-operation between the three Air Transport Corporations. 25. Overhaul of Aircraft. —In order to ensure the maximum of efficiency ^%nd economy, the three Air Transport Corporations will join in the creation .md management of a combined organisation for the overhaul of aircraft. 26. Training of Air Crews and Ground Staff. —The highest standards of skill and reliability must be achieved for air crews and ground staff. For this purpose the three Corporations will maintain a combined training estab lishment at which their flying and technical staffs will be trained, and at which refresher courses will be available. 27. Recruitment of Staff. —The constituent elements of the three Corpora tions have expressed their keen desire that every possible opportunity shall be given to officers and men of the Royal Air Force to take service with the Corporations. Close relations will be maintained with the Air Council, through the Minister for Civil Aviation, in order to give full effect to this intention. It will, however, be appreciated that openings for employment in civil air transport will not be large compared with the war-time strength of the Royal Air Force. 28. Welfare of Staff. —His Majesty's Government will also make it a con dition that the terms of service of these Corporations shall be those of a ' model employer and in particular that special provision shall be made for pilots and other members of air crews in the event of death or disable ment while engaged on flying duties, and for the granting of superannuation allowances to those classes for whom suitably paid ground employment can not be provided when they are past flying age. The participants in the Cor porations have expressed their ready assent to this condition. A scheme of Jthis kind which was settled in agreement with the appropriate employees’ Jnions, is already in operation in the case of B.O.A.C. 29. Relation of Minister for Civil Aviation to the Air Transport Corporations. —The appointment of members of the British Overseas Airways Corporation will be vested in the Minister for Civil Aviation; and he will also approve the appointment of the representatives of B.O.A.C. on the Boards of the other two main operating companies. • The appointments of Directors upon the Boards of the other two main operating companies will be subject to approval by the Minister, as will the representatives of the Shipping Lines upon the Boards of the subsidiary companies of B.O.A.C. The approval of the Minister will also be required to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of all the companies, both main and subsidiary, which play a part in the scheme. 30. Once the Corporations and subsidiary companies have been established and the members of their Boards appointed or approved by the Mmister, as the case may be, it is a cardinal principle of the plan that the Corporations and the companies should be responsible for the operation and managementO of the air services under their control. While management must vest in the Corporations and companies, the Minister must have a general control over broad aviation policy. Thus all companies must conform to the policy laid down by International Convention or by bilateral or multilateral agreements entered into with other States by His Majesty’s Government. Further, it is part of the plan that the Corporations shall operate, either directly or through their approved subsidiaries, all the air routes which are assigned to them. As stated above, an agreed schedule of routes so assigned to each of the Corporations will be settled. Ihese routes the Corporations will undertake to operate. They will not have the power to cease operation on any scheduled route without the consent of the Minister; but such consent will not be un reasonably withheld if events should prove that one or other of the agreed routes is neither commercially practicable nor required for the public interest. Subsidies. 31. Ihe general policy of His Majesty’s Government is that both intern?^ and external air services should operate as far as possible without subsidy. 32. Internal Services .—So far as internal services in the United Kingdom are concerned the participants in the Corporation to which these routes will be assigned—and who are investing their own money therein are willing to run without subsidy the agreed schedule of routes which will include, as well as the remunerative services, those routes which the Government regard as desirable in the public interest although some of them, if they were dealt with in isolation, could not be run at a profit. 33. International Services .—In the international field the Government have already declared that it is a cardinal aim of their policy to reduce wasteful competitive practices and, in particular, to control subsidies with the object of ultimately eliminating them altogether. To this end, they proposed in the White Paper on International Air Transport (Cmd. 6561) ' and later expounded at Chicago, their considered plan for avoiding un economic competition in international air services, by maintaining a broad equilibrium between transport capacity and traffic offering, a fair division of services between the national air lines engaged on international routes, and an agreement as to freight and passenger charges. His Majesty’s Govern ment had hoped to secure this by multilateral convention. This did not prove to be possible, but the broad principles laid down in the White Paper on International Air Transport remain the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment. In any reciprocal arrangements which they make with foreign countries, the Government will stipulate for the reasonable application of these principles. In this way it is hoped that wasteful'competition and subsidi^ may be largely eliminated upon the international routes in which Great Britain is interested. It is the intention that the agreed schedule of services on the European routes and the Latin American service should be operated without subsidy; provided always that services which the Government regard as essential to maintain afe not faced with highly subsidised competition. 34. Commonwealth Services .—In the past the operation of certain of the Commonwealth routes has required a subsidy. These routes are so essential in the interests of Commonwealth communications that His Majesty’s Govern ment will be prepared to afford the necessary financial help to enable B.O.A.C. to operate them. New Routes. 35. It is intended that the agreed schedule of routes to be initially assigned to the three Corporations shall include all those upon which, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, it is essential that United Kingdom Air Lines should9 lagement must vest in the ive a general control over :onform to the policy laid or multilateral agreements Government.

In the future as air traffic develops, the need for new routes will emerge. It is not intended to make any present commitment as to the right to operate new routes. The Government consider that any new routes should be left open to whatever operator—whether one of the main Corporations or some entirely new operator—can establish that he is best fitted to run them. 36. Power of the Government to require Corporations to operate new routes. The Government, however, may from time to time wish to have operated, either within the Commonwealth or outside it, a particular route which is not m the agreed schedule of services, and which is not the subject of any application to operate either by the Corporation or by a new operator. In such a case the Government would have power to require the appropriate Corporation to undertake-services on that route; but if the Corporation satisfied the Govern ment that such a service could not be run without loss, the Government must He prepared to give the Corporation such temporary financial assistance as may be reasonable. Assurance of Reasonable Facilities. 37. In order to ensure that the interests of the users of air transport are adequately and continuously safeguarded, it is intended to confer upon an impartial Tribunal jurisdiction to consider complaints as to such matters as the absence of reasonable facilities, the granting of undue preference, and the reasonableness of rates and charges of United Kingdom air lines. Such Tribunal should have power to enforce compliance with its decisions. In the case of complaints relating to overseas services—which are necessarily regulated by inter-Governmental agreement—the decision of the Tribunal must be subject to confirmation by the Minister. Co-operation with Commonwealth and Foreign Air Transport Operators. 38 The Commonwealth routes will be operated in full co-operation with other countries of the British Commonwealth. These routes have already been discussed with other Commonwealth Governments and with the Colonial Office as representing the Colonial Empire. The Commonwealth Govern ments have expressed their desire that reciprocal services from their countries to the United Kingdom shall De operated in parallel with the United Kingdom services to their countries. In order to make this parallel system effective and economical, arrangements are being made as regards facilities at the terminals and along the routes. Provision will also be made for an equitable « vision of revenue and expenditure where it is agreed that a pooling arrange- ent is advantageous. Arrangements for parallel operation will not, of course exclude—they should, on the contrary facilitate—the ultimate con version of parallel operation into joint operation whenever and wherever the Governments concerned agree that this has become desirable. aq. His Majesty’s Government will welcome the closest co-operation between foreign air line operators running services to the United Kingdom and the Air Transport Corporations set up under the Government plan. Here, too, while parallel operation will probably prevaiHn the initial phase, the possi bility of running joint services through subsidiary companies in which the foreign operator would participate, is one which in the view of His Majesty s Government may present great advantages. 40 It is hoped that the combined training establishment for air crews and ground staff which will be set up in the United Kingdom and possibly the joint organisation for the overhaul of aircraft may prove of use to other Commonwealth operators and to foreign operators who desire to avail them selves of the facilities offered by these organisations.10 Provision of Aircraft. 41. It is, of course, the intention of His Majesty’s Government, as it is the desire of the Corporations, that the Corporations shall use British aircraft as soon as they can be made available. The Ministry of Aircraft Production in collaboration with the Brabazon Committee, has already placed orders for a number of civil types. In war, when resources are strained and Service demands are paramount the Government must place the orders for aircraft for civil aviation, because they must control and allocate the priority and dis tribution of all calls upon the resources of the aircraft industry. But there must be the closest collaboration between the Department responsible for placing the orders, the user and the producer, so as to ensure that the user geis the type of aircraft that suits the services he is to operate, and that the producer can apply to the needs of the user, the best and latest experience in technical development and in the ingenuity and initiative of design staffs. Air line operators, no less than Air Forces, must have their eyes always on the- future and not on the past, save in so far as the experience of the past ma^^ point the way to future progress. Arrangements have already been made to bring the new Air Transport Corporations into close collaboration of this kind with the manufacturers of aircraft and the Government Departments concerned. As soon as circumstances permit the Corporations and their sub sidiaries will be free to buy aircraft direct from the manufacturers. 42. In the meantime it is the intention of the Government that in the initial stages where such a course is convenient, the Government shall lease the air craft which they have ordered to the Air Transport Corporations. The Government will also be prepared, in appropriate cases, to consider leasing to other Commonwealth operators and to foreign operators. 43. In framing their air transport policy, the Government have sought to apply to the development and expansion of our own air services, those principles of ordered progress which they have advocated in the international sphere. They are planning to bring into operation as rapidly as the exigencies of war permit, a complete network of Commonwealth services in full co-opera tion with other Commonwealth Governments. They are bringing into partner ship on practical business lines, those elements which, by reason of their experience and organisation, can contribute to the full and rapid development of British air transport. In this way the Government believe that they can best “ mset the needs of the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient, and economical air transport ', and enable British civil aviation, which has had to be subordinated to the supreme war effort, to take its rightful plac^ on the airways of the world.

Dated 1st September,1945. My dear Bird, P^L, COMPANY AIRCRAFT. In 1938/39 Company aircraft were permitted to operate In the Persian Gulf and necessary landings were made at Kuwait, Bahrain and Sharjah. The planes were employed on special jobs to transport senior Company staff to Bahrain and for geological exploration over the Truclal Coast and Muscat territory. 2. As regards Qatar the India Office In 1939 Intimated that there was no objection to Company planes landing at Qatar and the Company could make the necessary approach to the Ruler as laid down In the Qatar Oil Concession. The India Of 'ice also agreed to the Company constructing Its own landing ground adjacent to the oil field. Up to that time the India Office had not arranged for the issue of general regulations for civil aircraft in Qatar. 3. The matter has now been re-opened by Haifa consequent upon a London query, asking if our machines can be permitted to land at Kuwait (for refuelling), Bahrain and Qatar. 4. We should be very grateful for information on the following polntst- (a) Can it be assumed that there is no objection from His Majesty's Government or any other official source to our planes landing at Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. (b) Can similar landings be made on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat, i.e. in territories over which the Company holds oil agreements (excluding, of course, areas which may be specified by His Majesty's Govern ment from time to time where ownership Is contro versial)* (c) To whom should we make prior reference In respect of landings in various territories ? (d) In what Sheikhdoms do general regulations for civil aircraft already exist and if non-existent what Is the alternative procedure ? (e) Will it be possible at this Juncture to obtain general permission to cover any number of landings at all places over a period of at least a year or more provided all planes to be used are listed on the respective permits ? (f) Can It be assumed now that the war is over that the Company is free to proceed with the construction of its own landing ground at Qatar, if it so desires, acting on the India Office 1939 permission and that the R.A.F. and/or B.O.A.C. angles need not now be taken into account ?5* It is not anticipated that landings at Qatar will take place until a new landing ground Is constructed but circumstances might arise In which the use of the Dohah R.A.F. landing ground would be necessary. 6. Early information would be appreciated on our query para 4(a) and if this does not entail reference to the Hon'ble the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf perhaps this point could be the subject of an interim reply.

Packer has now written to say that P.C.L. would like general permission over a period of at least a year to land in the following places:• Kuwait Bahrain Qatar Sharjah Dubai and the landing ground near Muscat town* He agrees that Dubai could be taken out of the list as there are at present no alighting areas other than for flying boats. I see no object in this since conceivably the company may charter a flying- boat or find it convenient to use a landing area to serve an oil camp in an emergency. I therefore propose to ask for the general permission for landings in Bahrain and Qatar and to inform the .shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai that these may take place in their respective territories. I shall await your confirmation before taking aoitlon. 4* Packer has asked for an assurance that a like permission will be given as regards Kuwait and Muscat. I should be grateful for material for a reply. Packer adds that any other places where special conditions or circumstances are involved could be the subject of special applications pending fuller information on the proposed movements of P.C.L. explora tion parties.

So fi ce 1945. I would have preferred to defer comment until I had access to my own records, but my personal views, for what they are worth, are as follows. 2. By the final Act of the Conference it is apperently assumed under Recommendation 1 of Section Viii re-d with Article Viii Section 2 ofAppendix 1, that His Majesty^ Government have acquired the right to dispose of the Sheikh doms interests in Civil Aviation. I submit that there is no foundation for this view. 3 . I will take the States in detail. First as regards the Trucial Shaikhs- the view is presumably bas d on the exclusive treaties of the 6 th Id-rch, 1892. These treaties, however, do not cede us any authority to grant concessions to foreigners v/ithout reference to the rulers, and the Shaikhs would certainly not interpret t'-eir agreements in this way. The rulers are, of course, well aware•of their rights, and it will be recalled th-t we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air ^ . ri-hts for- oucselves ! The Civil Air agreements with Sharjah and Debai give us no support as they are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B.O.a.C. 4. Bahrain. ^er^ again ou^ position is presumably b ed on the exclusive Treaties of the 22nd December, 1880, and the 13th March, 1892. These treaties however are purely negative. The Shaikh birds himself not to enter into any agreement with foreign powers, but be does not give us csrte blanc to act for Mm and i r the past he has always been consulted in dvance where his interests were ^ affected. In addition the Civil Air Agreement expressly provides.that we will not allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodromes without the Shaikh’s consent, and this completely *stops any claim on our part. 5* Kuwait. Here the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic than that of Bahrain and the ohMkh is not •precluded ^rom correspondence with foreign powers. His Civil Air igr^ement is equally definite and precludes us from ■ 11 owing* foreign aircraft to se tl aerodrome or aerodromes without the Shaikh’s consent. In other wo ads the Shaikh expresely retains (and has been alloweo by us to retain) the power J rMf ai'rcr« ft to use his State 6 7 6 . In the case of Muscat I underst*nd.th t. it has been accented that the Sultan Is not bound by the Chicago Agreement and the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately. v. 7 . Where we give advance intimation o p our requirements to Gulf Sttes, make it clear to them th t their interests r . Te be in-' safeguarded, and t-ke care not to off nd their susceptibilities, then it is usually possible to obtain our re ulrements without difficulty. -’f ^tis is nco •dOfie the Politic- 1 officer’s task is rendered immesurably2 . more diff 1 cultand a. molehill msy easily tv^rr. into- a mountain. In this case I myself had not seen a copy of the agreement until a week or so ago. It must he remembered that our position in the Persian Gulf has no other foundation than the good?'ill of the States and c-n easily he undermined if this is once lost. 8 . I t'ink it-is clear that our actions at Cnicago cannot be held in any w-y binding on the Persian Gulf Shaikh- domsunless and until they have accepted the obligations involved. s I have temnor-rl.lv vacated my post it does not seem appropriate for me to suggest solutions for the difficulty- r nd I would prefer to wait until I have resumed charge and c-n consider the matt r on the snot.

The question of H.V.G^ right to speak on behalf of the Arab sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (Koweit, Bahrein and the '’rucial Sheikhdoms) in the international agreements has recently come to the for6 in connection «4th (l) the Chicago Air Agreements, aj and (2) the recent/Petroleum Agreement between the U.E. and U«S. Governiiients. The standard definition of the status of these ~heikhdoroe is ’’independent ^ixab States under British protection but not British A rotectorates*. 2* The ^hicago ^ir Agreements , considering the briefs for the U.K. and Indian delegations at Chicago it was thought desirable that the ‘--heikhdoms should be brought within the terms of the draft U.K, rUT Convention in order that traffic between the Sheikhdoms and other U.K, territories should be reserved to the U.K. as 'cabotage*' ihis was considered to be effected by Section 2 of Article VIIT of the Interim Agreement as signed, since this Section defined the territory of a State as including 'territory under protection 4 * and the Sheikhdoms are territoxies under British protection* There was no list of protected territories, etc., attached to the Chicago 4wgrsements. it has since come to light that there are certain inconsistencies between the Chicago Air Agreements and our Civil Aviation Agreements with Bahrain and Koweit, as both the latter agreements provide that F.M.G. shall not grant the use of aerodromes to foreign aircraft without the consent of the Sheikh and that aircraft shall not fly over, or land in, the Sheikh's territories except under special authorisation issued by the ^heikh* the other hand, in the Chicago 'Two Freedoms^ Agreement (International Air Services Transit Agreement) each signatory state has granted the other contracting states the privilege of flying across the landing for non-traffic purpoied in 'it^x territories' and the definition of 'territory* in Section 2 of Article VIII of the interim agreement as including 'Territory under protection' is applicable to the Two Freedoms agreement* $« crticle FI I of the x eiroleum Agi’temen t between the U.K. and U.S. Governments states that the si gnat ory Governments agree '(a) Tiiat the general purpose of this Agreement is to facilitate the orderly development of the international petroleum trade and that no yrovisioa in this Agreement, with the exception of Article II, is to be construed as applying to the operation of the domestic petroleum industry within the country of either Government* (c) That for the purposes of this Article the word 'country' shall mean: (l) in relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, those British Colonies, overseas territories, protectorates, protected states and^/mandated territories administered by that Government**••••. lists of vdiich as at the date of this Agreement have been exchanged*' it will be seen that the definition of country appliedled ofcly to Article VII of the Agreement. Itoe lists which oleum Agreement is a general declaration of intention it would have made no practical difference if they had been so included. more difficult. attention is invited to the note dated 27th September, 1945 recorded by Sir Geoffrey ^rior on the subject (Copy attached « mnexl) atatua of the Arab Sheikhdoms the position was expounded at some length in Foreign 'Office letter Eo. S 647/4/91 of I2rh February, 1935 (copy attached- Annex II) in connection with the status of Bahrein for the purposes of the Import duties Act, 1932. The general conclusion seems to be that, in cases where H. \0 enter into inter national agreements covering territories under British protection, the Arab tiheikhdoras need not be regarded as automatically included, but that H.K.O. are^at liberty to include them if they so wish ny specifically designating them. Before, however, so designatirig them the'agreement of the Rulers is clearly desirable, since without it H.M.G. cannot normally Implement the obligations which they iky have unaertaken internationally * Generally speaking, it • s H*I.«Gr , 8 policy so far as possible to lay emphasis vis-a—vi foreign countries, in the independent position of the iheikhd ln ^ r ^ er forestall foreign criticism of our privileged position there, and to counter foreign (in particular Iersian claims to sovereignty over the territory of the Sheikhdoms. +v 6# , the P ar ticular case of the Chicago *Ur ^greemen the conclusion seems to be that, internationally spenking, we are able to include tne bneikhdoraa as territories covered by the U.K. signature, but the 4 ue£tion of actually so designating chem will not arjse until the necessity occurs of designating airports within the Bheikhdoras. On this interpretaticn if may he comparatively easy for the iolitioil Resident to secure the agreement of the Bheikhe to the appllcation of the Chicago Air Agreements to their territories vithout their feeling that due consideration has not been paid by H.IK.O. to thei position.

Tnettreaties, however, do not cede in any authority to grant conceseions to foreigners without reference to the rulers, and the Shaikhs would certainly not interpret their agreements in this way. ~he rulers are, of course, well aware of their rights, and it will be r called that we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air rights f or ourselves i The Civil nir Agreement with diarjah and )ebai give us no support as they are purely ad hoc agreements for the benefit of B.O.a.C. 4* B ahrain .

Here the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic than that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers. His Civil Air agreement is equally definite and precludes us from allovdng foreign aircraft to use the aerodrome or aerodromes without the Shaikh*s consent. In other words the ~haikh expressly retains (and has been allowed by us to retain) the power to permit foreign aircraft to use his State. 6, In the case of Muscat 1 understand that it has been accepted.that the Sultan is not bound by the Chicago Agreement and the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately. 7. ../here we give advance intimation of our requirements to Gulf States, make it clear to them that their interests are being safeguarded, and take care not to offend their susceptibilities, then it is usually possible to obtain our requirements without difficulty.

(E 647/4/91) My dear Gilbert, With reference to your letter No. P.Z. 583/35 of the 26th January to Rendel, you will remember that I showed you yesterday a minute by Beckett on your draft reply to the letter from the Board of Customs and Excise about the status of Bahrain. ,Since, however, Beckett sees grave^ objections to the draft which you sent us, I send you‘this record of his views in writing. 2. In general, Beckett*s position is that, although he fully appreciates the strenght of the political arguments against stating, at any rate publicly, that Bahrain or any of the other Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf are part of the British Empire for any purpose, he considers that according to international law, since His Majesty*s Government control the foreign relations of these Sheikhs (except of course the Sultan of Muscat) these are British protected states over which from the point of view of international law His Majesty possesses sovereignty and therefore we shall have to walk very warily in any official description of the status of the Sheikhdom of Bahrain. The position in international law is however not conclusive for the purpose of the interpretation of an Act of Par liament of the United Kingdom and the following represents the best that he can do in the way of straining the law to meet political exigencies without absolutely misrepres enting it. 3. He suggests that your reply to the Solicitor of the Customs should begin by referring to Section 21 of the Import Duties Act (1932) and pointing out that this is a definition of the British Empire for the purposes of this Act and not for general purposes, and that the question at issue is merely whether Bahrain is or is not covered by any of the words of this definition Section. The only words by which it could be covered, if it were covered at all, are 'territories under His Majesty*s protection'. The letter should then go on to say that the position is that, under treaties concluded with the rulers of Bahrain, the Sheikh of Bahrain, has no relations with any Power other than His Majesty*s Government, and His Majesty(s Government deal with foreign Powers over any questions which arise in relation to Bahrain and have also under taken certain obligations to protect the territories of the Sheikh from foreign aggression; th#t, as regards the internal government of his territory, the Sheikh is left full Independence except that jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners is exercised by His Majesty, who is represented in Bahrain by a political agent. Though it must be recognised that the expression 'territories un der His Majesty*s proteation' is held to cover territories such as the Malay States, Sarawak, Brunei and Zanzibar, /where there is...2 where there is a native ruler who enjoys independence in the matter of the internal government of his territories in which His Majesty does not directly exercise jurisdict ion except over foreigners and where from the formal point of view the position is rather similar to that of Bahrain, nevertheless there are grounds for distinguishing Bahrain from these territories. In the first place, the measure of control exercised in fact by His Majesty*s Government in the other territories mentioned above is greater tnan in Bahrain, and in the second place there are political difficulties which would be caused by regarding Bahrain as covered by these words in this Act which do not apply in the case of the other territories mentioned. For political reasons it has been deemed expedient in commun ications to foreign Governments to stress the independence of Bahrain and further the ruler of Bahrain would probably take objection to the inclusion of his territories as part of the British Empire, even under a purely statutory definition of the British Empire for a particular purpose, the niceties of which he would never understand. There fore, although from the point of view of strict inter national law it would be correct to regard Bahrain as a territory under His Majesty’s protection, it does not necessarily lollow that Bahrain should be regarded as coming under these words in this particular Act of Par liament. The view might be taken that the connection with Bahrain is in practice so loose that it should not be regarded as coming within the intention of Parliament in enacting this Section, and we should therefore suggest that the Customs should act on the viev^ that Bahrain is not covered by the section. If the ruling or the Customs in this sense were challenged, the question might come before a court, which would them have to decide the matter on the basis of such information as was officially comm unicated to the court on behalf of the Crown. 4. The letter might then go on to sa y that the position is the same in regard to Koweit and the Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, but that the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman is in any case in a wholly different position, and, though His Majesty’s Government exercise a particular influence there and protect nationals of the Sultanate in foreign countries, the Sultan is still free to enter into direct relations with other Powers, and therefore, even from the point of view of strict international law, his territories would not be covered by the expression ,f territories under His Majesty’s protection' and a fortiori not covered by this expression in an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.

We also take this opportunity to request Your Highness that the Post Office be persuaded to allow mail to leave whenever cars are available between Kuwait &amp; Iraq, apart from the system followed at present, i.e. that of des- patchiry mail twice a week, as this delays trade commu nications between tne merchants of your subjects ?.nd the ceople in other countries.

Under Article 1 of the International Air Services Transit Agreement, Air France, as a scheduled international air service can claim the privilege of flying across the territory of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms or of landing in it for non-traffic purposes. Under Article 6 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, however, this privilege cannot be exercised except with the special permission or other authorization of the State concerned, in the present case His Majesty's Government acting on behalf of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms. Ho intimation has been received that such permission has been sought or accorded, and it is revested that the position may kindly be elucidated. 3. In negotiations recently successfully concluded for the extern ion of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement (on which a separate report is being made) the Ruler of Bahrain requested that he should be given previous notice before any foreign air service commenced to operate through Bahrain. If aircraft of ”Alr France” fly acrose hie territory he should be informed accordingly. The Ruler of Kuwait and the Trueial Coast Rulers have not made a similar request but it is desirable that, as in the case of flights by Trans continental and Western Airways, they also should be notified. 4.

(b) That nothing in thie Agreement shall be construed ae iiqpairlng or modifying any law or regulation or the right to enact any law or regulatlon 9 relating to the importation of petroleum into the country of either Government! (e) That for the purposes of this Article the word •country* shall means (i) in relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 9 the United Kingdom 9 those British Colonies 9 overseas territories 9 protsctorates 9 protected states and all mandated territories administered by that Government... lists of *iioh as at that date of thie Agreement have been exchanged.* It will be seen that trie definition of oountry applied only to Article YI1 of the Agreement. The lists whioh were exchanged did not include the Arab Shaikhdoms. The letroleua Agreement is a general declaration of intention and it would have made no practical difference if they had been eo included, except that it wouid then have been possible to hold that the oil trade between the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoma «id the U.K. or other British territory was domestio trade 9 and to that extent the activities of the International Petroleum Commission in regard to the international Petroleum trade might have been impaired. 5. as regards the Bret ton hoods a,, re amenta , the signatory governments, wider Article XX Section 2 tg) of the Monetary Pund Agreement and Article XX Section 2(g5 of the international Bank Agreement, undertook to accept the Agreements both on their own behalf and in respect of all colonies, etc., i ncluding all territories under their protection . In point or fact the obligations were not such that they were likely to be of any practical effect so far &amp;s the Shaikhdoms were concerned, and H.K.G. , in the instrument of signature deposited with the U.S.Government, felt entitled to declare that they had taken 'all steps neoesaary to carry out all of its obligations under the said Agreement', in spite of the fact that the Shaikhs had not been consulted by them. U. The lop 11 oat ions involved are mueh the same as in the case of the Chicago Air Agreements. It has however been considered sufficient in this case simply to inform the Rulers that H.M.G. have accepted certain obligations und*r the Bretton Woods Agreements which will have effect in their territory. 7. The genmral conclusion seems to be that if we are going to maintain the position that the Arab Bhaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf ^excluding Muscat) are British protected states and can have no international relatione with other states sxoept through H.M.G., than we must from time to time under* take international obligations on their behalf, and must see, as a domestic matter between ourselves and the dhaikhdome, that the latter fulfil those obligations so far as is required./ 8 * Asiuax i . I have been shown the India Offioe file regarding the position of the Persian Qulf Shaikh dome under the Chioago air agreement 9 and understand that I am inrited to oom.^ent on this subject* I would have preferred to defer oosment until I had access to my own records, but my personal views, for what they are north, are as follows* 2 * By the Final Act of the Conference it io apparently assumed under Recommendation 1 of Section VIII read with Article VIII section £ of Appendix 1, that His kajeelyr'e Government have acquired the right to dispose of the Shaikh* dome intcreate in Civil Aviation* I suhiaii taat there is no foundation for this view* 3* I will tako the States in detail* Firstt as regards the Truoial Shaikhs • the view is presumably based on tbs exclusive treaties of the 6 th &amp;arch 189B* These treaties, however do not cede us any authority to grant concessions to foreigners without reference to the rulers, and the Shaikhs would cert a inly not interpret their agreements in this way* The rulers are 9 of course, well aware of their rights, and it will be recalled that we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air rignta for our selves 1 The Civil Air Agreonents with Sharjah and Bubal give us no support as they are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B*O.A*C. .Bahrain * Here again our psoition is presumably based on the exclusive Treaties of the 22 nd December, 1380, and the 13th If arch 9 1882* These treaties however are purely negative. The Shaikh binds himself not to enter into any agreement with foreign powers f but he does not give ue carte blanche to act for hi&amp; and in the past he has always been coneeiited in advance where his interests were affected* In addition the Civil Air Agreusent expressly provides that we will not allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodrome without the Shaikh^ consent 9 and this completely estops any claim on our part* Kuwait * Here the exclusive treaty of 1399 is lees emphatic than that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers* ilia Civil Air Agreement is equally definite and precludes us from allowir^ foreign aircraft to use the aerodrome or aerodromes without the Shaikhs consent* In other words the Shaikh expressly retains (and has been allowed by us to retain) the power to pemit foreign aircraft to u»e hie St&amp;te. 6 . In the ease of Muscat X understand that it has been accepted that the Su tan is not bound by the Chicago Agreement and the question of bringing him into the picture is being pursued separately* 7 * here we give advance Intimation of our requirements to Gulf States, tanks it clear to them that their interests are being safeguarded, and take care not to offend their susceptibilities, then It is usually possible to obtain our requirements without difficulty. if this is not done the folitioal Officer f s task is rendered immeasurably more difficult and a molehill may easily turn into e mountain* In this ease I myself had not seen a copy of the agreement until a week or so ago* it must be remembered that our position in the Persian Gulf has no other foundation than the goodwill of the States md can easily be undermined if this is once lost*8 * X think it 1 b clear that our actions at Chicago cannot he held in any way binding on the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms unlesc and until they hare accepted the obligations involved.

Dear Harrison, The Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation (PICAO) is in the process of convening a number of Kegional Meetings for the purpose of settling, by agreement among the countries converned, the pattern and linkage of the various telecommunications, navigational and radio aids, and safety precautions that are needed throughout the area for international civil aviation, and to agree on the adoption of uniform apparatus and methods of procedure. The Atlantic basin has been covered by a Regional Meeting at Dublin in February and March, the European area by a similar meeting' in Paris in April and May, and it is proposed to have a Regional Meeting for the Middle East at Cairo some time in September. Air Vice Marshal Sir Frederick Bowhill, our representative on P.I.C.A.O. signalled to us some time ago to enquire whether Trans-Jordan, the Yemen and the Trucial Shaikhs of the Persian Gulf could be invited to the Conference either as members or observers. We consulted the Foreign Office regarding Transjordan and the Yemen, but I find that in respect of the Trucial Shaikhs we replied on our own initiative that their external relations V7ere conducted entirely through H.M.G., and thay they could not be invited to attend the Conference in any capacity. Sir Frederick Bowhill has now signalled to enquire whether Muscat and Oman are in the same category as the Trucial Shaikhs, and I am writing this letter to ask for your advice on this point. If they are full sovereign states there would i presumably be no objection to their being invited to the Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall. Conference S.W.lConference in their own ri£;ht though they might possibly not wish to attend, but if their foreign relations are conducted through H.l.G. this would presumably be inappropriate and their interests, if any, would have to be looked after by the British representative. Yours sincerely, Sd. E. Ratcliffe CousinsEXT 4470/46 India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 1st July, 1946. Dear Katcliffe Cousins, Thank you for your letter No. DAS(P)/S.290 of 26th June about the representation of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms and Oman at the P.I.C.A.O. Regional Meeting for the Middle East. 2. The Trucial Shaikhs consist of the rulers of Ajman, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kalba, Ras al Khaimah, Umm al Qaiv/ain and Sharjah. I suspect however that Bowhill meant to refer also to Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. These are all British-protected States and their interests should as you say be represented by H.K.G. Our representative at the Meeting will clearly need guidance as to the interests of those States - perhaps by the attachment to the U.K. delegation of a rep- presentative of the Political Resident, if the latter should recommend this course. 3. Muscat and Oman (which is one State) is an independent sovereign State and it would be correct for an invitation to be sent to the Sultan direct, if the fact that Muscat is not a party to the Chiago Agreements makes no differ ence. The Sultan is however unlikely to be able to send a representative and the State is not in a position itself to provide aerodrome installations, equipment etc.. You will remember that in the draft Civil Air Agreement with Muscat, proposed a year ago by the Government of India contemplated that they (or H.M.G.) might themselves establish aerodrome installations etc., in Muscat on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat. While therefore it would be appropriate for an invitation to v the E.

A copy of this correspondence is being sent by air mail to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf so that he may be informed of the position. Yours sincerely, Sd. F.A.K. Harrison.

The Committees sat simultaneously, the United Kingdom being represented by one or two members on each committee^. Every evening there was a meeting of the United Kingdom dele gation to exchange reports dn ohe work of the various committees and to decide policy. Generally the discussions were of a purely technical nature and there was little of political interest as may be seen from the minutes of the meetings forwarded herewith. The following points are of interest:- (i) It was decided to recommend the designation of Bahrain as an international long-range land and water aerodrome and Dubai as a water aerodrome (vide DOC CA 88 ). This may involve the extension of improvement of the existing aerodrome and facilities; ( (ii) An Iranian delegate objected to the mention of Bahrain as a 'country” on the grounds that it was part of Iran. A note of his objection was included in the minutes {vide DOC CA 131, para 8 .) 3.

Dear Harrison, Jones has handed over to roe your letter Ext.4075/46 of the 20th June regarding flights by 'Hortons Airlines' along the Arab Coast air route. The reference presumably is to 'Horton Air Services Ltd' which is a firn engaged in air taxi and charter flights. It has carried out a number of charter flights between the United Kingdom and India since January 1946, but there is no question of a regular air service. The operations of the Company are not illegal as the law stands, nor are they prohibited by the Civil Aviation Bill now before Parliament. It is possible that we nay have to give consideration in this Uinistry to the devising of 'measures for the better control of non-regular operations for hire, but for the present we should be inclined to endorse the suggestion of the Political Resident that in as much as these operations are covered by the licence granted to the aircraft, no special authorisation in the terms of the Civil Air Agreements with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit is necessary. We should agree also that the words 'by the Sheikh' should be expunged from Article 3 of both the Civil Air Agreements. The aircraft of the Company normally follow the route liarseilles-Elmas-Tunis-Tripoli-Benghazi-El Aden-Hersa Ilatruh- Almaza-Lydda-Habbaniya-Shaibah-Bahrein-Sliar jah-Jiwani- Karachi-Bombay# We are taking steps to warn the Company that they must not fly over the Musandam Peninsula or any other part of the Sultan of kuscat’s Dominions.
