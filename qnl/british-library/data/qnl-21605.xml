Four unsuccess- ■ful attempts were made by the Arabs to retake it, the last being in 1846. Treaties of peace and friendship were concluded with all the principal ' Protectorate ' Chiefs as early as January 1839. The boundaries between our Protectorate and the Turkish Province of Yemen were demarcated in 1903 and 1904. For further details see Military Report, Aden 1 rotectorate, &lt;Chapter I. CHAPTER II. GEOGRAPHY. Boundary. The boundary line between our Protectorate and Turkish territory begins at Husn Murad, near Perim, and extends o\ er 200 miles to a point on the river Bana, near Kataba. From here onwards a line drawn north-east from Lakama2 ash-Sh'ub, a village in Amiri territory, defines the dividing line 'of the sphere of influence of the two Powers. On this frontier, the most important section is that comprised by the Amir of Dala's, the Haushabi, and a portion of the Subaihi territories. Through these districts pass the main trade routes from Turkish Yemen, and they are also the only routes which could be utilised by a force advancing into British territory from Turkish Yemen, or the converse. Roughly speaking the area is made up of a sandy littoral belt about twenty miles in width, rising steadily to a rugged mountain range, beyond which on the north-east lies a desert plateau. In the littoral belt there are patches of fairly fertile and well populated ground along the line of the principal mountain streams such as the Tiban and the Bana. These streams themselves, except in flood time, do not reach the sea. Between these patches is blown sand or shingle desert. The higher mountain districts are for the most part fertile and well cultivated. Aden Peninsula. —The six main localities or quarters of Aden, proceeding round Aden from south-west to north-east In the vernacular of motor car and cab drivers, in fact of all natives, ' Aden ' means the Crater. Local landmarks working from south-west are—Elephants Back (Lighthouse,) E. T. C. Office, Aden Head-Quarter Offices, Tarshain Fort, Morbut Fort, Union Club, The Crescent, Hedjuff Gate, Main Pass, Obstruction Pier, §hum Shum, Barrier Gate, Sira Island, South Gate, Ras Marshag. The coast line from Ras Marshag to Elephants Back is un inhabited and barely accessible either by land or sea. Shaikh Othman.—The Shaikh Othman position protects the north side of the harbour and the ' Aqueduct ' water supply. The distance via Khor Maksar is ten miles. The journey by rail to Shaikh Othman takes 35 minutes from Maala. are :— 1. Tarshain. 2. Morbat. 3. Tawahi. 4. Hedjuff. 5. Maala. 6. The Crater.3 0 CHAPTER III. POPULATION. Aden Settlement [including Perm).—The following figures are taken from the census report of 1911 and include troops and followers:— — Musal- mans. Hindus. , Christ ians. Jews. Miscel lane ous. total. Aden proper .

Arabs. —The Arab tribesmen of the hills are considered to be more warlike than the plain dwellers. The former are fairly well armed with breech-loading rifles of assorted patterns. The Arab favours shaking hands rather than salaaming. He appreciates being met in that spirit, whatever his status in life, and if treated in a friendly way is ready to respond. Pirmness, courtesy, and square dealing are the chief requisities in order to secure the Arab's loyalty. Menial Classes (Muwallids), —Menial classes in Arabia have a considerable admixture of negro blood, and, as a rule, are darker and coarser featured. Somalis. —Somalis are principally found as servants to Europeans, •boatmen, and syces. The good men are said to be4 unusually good but very rare. As a class they are intelligent, especially in the matter of picking up English, but inclined to be vain, indolent, and disrespectful. J ew s. —Jews constitute a considerable element in the popu lation. They are treated by the Arabs with a good deal of contumely, but. are a fairly prosperous and contented commu nity. Tliey live in quarters set apart for them and form the artisan class of South Yemen. In appearance they are distinguished by long locks of hair brought down in front of the ears. As a general rule they are not unpleasing in appearance. They are largely used in the Yemen as messengers, the Absence' of blood feuds making their arrival at their destination the more probable. CHAPTER IV. TRIBES. The administration of the country outside British territory is patriarchal under petty Sultans. Clans. —The principal combinations of the Protectorate are Ka'aiti (Mukulla), Fadli, Abdali, Haushabi, Subaihi and Dala (Dhali) Yafa, Baida, Baihan and Aulaki. The following is the generally accepted nomenclature m the Aden Hinterland for tribesmen, though in places other styles are used. The following will, however, be everywhere understood:— The individual of The Sub-clan of The Clan of The Tribe of The People ofJebel ftadfan). Ism al Shakhs e.g. Muhammad Saleh of the = Bait or fara = Fakhidha = Kabila = Ahl Khurman sub-clan of the Kutaibi clan of the Al Ajud tribe of the Ahl Radfan (or nf fV»P HistrlPt6 Note oh Tribes who are likely to be friendly or unfriendly by Colonel H. F. Jacob, First Assistant Resident, Aden {Sep tember 1916). All the Subaihi tribesmen may be expected to be un friendly till such time as we score a victory, then '' they will rush to the succour of the victors.' Fighting men 2,000. I am of opinion that, when we move up seriously, most of the Abdali clans who stayed behind in their houses and espoused the Turkish cause—in the main only to safeguard their houses and lands—will not fight against us, though it will be well not to trust them too implicitly, at first. Fight ing men 3,000. The Haushabis are likely to help the Turks. If the old Fadli Sultan is still alive, his unruly tribesmen the Marakisha will probably 'snipe' our camps. Fighting men 2,000. There are representatives in Lahej of the Jahwari and Hurebi clansmen of Mausata (Upper \afai) who will be hostile to us, and possibly a scattering of certain Lower Yafai tribes men of A1 Karao. Otherwise I believe the Arabs on our side of the border will at first be passive spectators till the Turks retreat, when they may be expected to harrass the Turkish lines of communications. As to Turkish-Arabs, the partisans of Ibn Jsasir Mukbil will join us if we push up; and the people of Hajariya will probably follow suite. Everything depends on a successful first stroke. JSl.B. —The above refers to the situation as it existed in December 1916. For further details as to fighting strengths of tribes, etc., see Military Report. « CHAPTER V. CLIMATE. In a country of such varying altitudes as the Aden Pro tectorate, ranging from the sea level to 8,000 feet, it follows that a general appreciation of the climate is impossible. For purposes of description, the country may be divided into throe6 11 oo low-lvins plain country between the lulls g Ttl sTSre the lower valleys and the hill country mi ZZcoast F! 6 —; Farther in it is the typical ho :risu ab ) e obstacle to pro- to February' t he cllm ^ ^ f lowcr h ill, it is very hot and close St StyTnt much -^a^rep^SK. 0f onwards, «« or 40° F and even lower temperatures, being regis It'may be worthy of note that ^ ^o-d 'ses « even before the foothills are reached, Lahe] Deing. 400 feet, although only half way to the Monsoon. —The monsoon season is from June 15th to August Slst.

Trru^'f 3 6 Mhalla Wharf. 7 Petroleum Pier. 8 Obstruction Pier. the Port Trust Offices.) ^wcrasr a - tss at of W. have none.)o Menakem Mossa's Wliarf is situated at 1 awahi immediately east of the Port Trust Offices, and is reserved exclusively for the landing of animals. A wharf frontage for three heavy lighters is available, and animals -can be walked ashore at all states of the tide. The wharf is provided with a spacious 'forming U p ' place known as ' Tawahi Bay Reclamation, from which animals are marched a distance of two miles to temporary stables at Maala and Isthmus. After passing Hedjutf gate (abou^ | mile from the wharf), the road bifurcates into two parallel branches running within a hundred yards of each other ; by following the right hand branch, the heavy motor traffic on the main road can be avoided. Maala Wharf is the only wharf in Aden equipped with modern facilities for disembarking troops and stores. The main wharf has a frontage of 900 feet, and is lighted throughout with elec- tricity. A row of five corrugated iron sheds, each with a fioor area of 15,000 feet capable of accommodating a battal on without overcrowding, stretches the length of the jetty at a distance of 35 feet from the water's edge. Troops are landed opposite the sheds ; vehicles, etc., on the open space where the jetty extends westward of the sheds. Five travelling steam cranes are available, one with a lift of 5 tons, one of 3 tons, and three of 30 cwts. There are railway sidings connect ing with the main line one end on to the jetty at its eastern extremity, and a second running the whole length of the jetty. The area' in rear of the jetty has been formed into a base supply depot, and thi^ restricts the space available for ' forming up ' ; the two exits from the wharf are also inconveniently narrow and give access to a crowded native bazaar. Infantry, howe^ r, would be entrained on the two sidings referred to above, and only vehicles would ordinarily be required to pass through the supply depot. The jetty is in telephone communication with the Steamer Point Exchange, either from the Wharf Super intendent's Office or the office of the Base Supply Depdt situated over the Main Gateway. Troops required to remain a night at Maala before proceed ing to Shaikh Othman are accommodated in the jetty sheds, and temporary cooking places for British and Indian troops have been erected. Condensed water for cooking and drinking can always be obtained from tanks on the wharf ; washing can be done at the water's edge on the rear face of the jetty. Officers messes are recommended to have a supply of tinned food withthem for the first night ashore, to avoid the necessity for any but the simplest form of cooking. No shops are available within 2^ miles of the jetty from which supplies can be obtained to supplement rations Rations Irt obtained direct from the Supply Depot on the wharf. Troops warned in advance that they will be required o bivouac a night at Maala should have ration indents prepared before disembarkation. No hawkers are allowed on the jetty, vnd troops who may have occasion to leave the jetty should be warned against purchasing any mineral waters or othe liquor in neighbouring bazaars. Petroleum Pier is suitable for disembarking a half battalion at a time It is a long narrow pier, 1.000 feet in length and 15 feet broad, with a pier-head of 21,000 square feet at its extrem ity A narrow gauge railway equipped with a light engine and ample rolling stock runs the whole length of the pier, and is uSful for carrying kits, stores, etc., to the siding where troops are entrained'for Shaikh Othman. Obstruction Pier is supplied with a railway siding from the main line, but it cannot accommodate more than twelve sma trucks and so is unsuitable for the disembarkation of any but small bodies of troops. It is equipped with a hand crane cap able of lifting a weight of 15 tons, and is ordinarily used for landing heavy stores such as railway material etc. It is only a few hundred yards distant from Petroleum Pier and the two can conveniently be used in conjunction for the landing of a battalion, i.e., baggage, stores, and ammunition at Obstruction Pier, balance of personnel at letroleum Pier. Tn addition to the shore cranes mentioned above, the Port Trust have in uso a floating crane capable of lifting 3 tons. Cavalry and artillery horses are stabled in temporary shelters within a few hundred yards of Maala Jetty ; each shelter fiO horses. The horses are watered in two stone w-vteT troughs, each 90 feet long, situated close by at the shore Tm of Petroleum Pier. To reach these troughs from the stables, holfs hav toTross the railway at a level crossing and neces sary precautions should therefore be taken. Ihe water supplied It the troughs is condensed, and it has been found from experience that some little patience is often required to make a horse drink Aden water for the first time. It should also bt noted that water is a marketable commodity in Aden, and any© 9 native found stealing water from troughs should be arrested and sent to the nearest police station. Water stored at stables m buckets and other receptacles should be covered up to avoid pollution by dust. For the same reason troughs are emptied and cleaned at regular intervals. Any shortage of water shou t be immediately reported to the officer in charge Base Supply Depot at Maala. All transport animals are accommodated without shelter in the Isthmus, and are watered at stone troughs adjoining the camping ground and served by a pipe from the Isthmus water tanks. The water supplied at these troughs is well water conveved by duet from Shaikh Othman; it is slightly saline in quality and liable to produce mild diarrhoea for a few days. It is fit for human consumption, and preferred by the natives to condensed water. The rail journey to Shaikh Othman occupies thirty-five minutes only, and troops are conveyed chiefly in open trucks. The Railway Station at Shaikh Othman is situated in the open without any buildings in the neighbourhood to^^rfere with the ' forming up ' of troops ; transport can be placed alongside the siding at which troops detrain. Troops proceedmg in bivouac to the northward of the village are conveyed thither on an extension of the main line terminating at present at Robat. Hotels. —There are two hotels in the Crescent— Aden (Tawahi) where fair board and lodging is obtainable. The rates (quoted by the Proprietors in September 1916) were— Grand Hotel, Royal— class accommodation for ten, rate Rs. 5. 2nd Class accommodation for twenty-one, rate Rs. 3. Hotel, Europe. —1st Class, twenty-five, rate Rs 5. 2nd Class accommodation could be provided, by two or more occupying the same room, the 2nd class rate being Ks. d-8. The Hotel Europe, in addition, might be able to contract for board only, in the hotel, or in the vicinity, e.g., Maala, rates per day Rs. 4 to 6 approximately. Servants. —Good cooks are practically unobtainable. The number of syces and oth&lt;?r servants available is limited, and the quality indifferent.10 Native liquor, coffzz and tea shops. —Liquor, coffeG and tea shops owned by Indians, Arabs and Somalis form a feature of the Native bazaars in Aden and Shaikh Othman. Indian troops and followeis patronise them to a certain extent. The principal of these are distributed as follows :— Locality. Liquor Bars. Tea and coffee shops. Aden (Tawahi Crescent) 4 7 17 Aden—Crater 6 18 Shaikh Othman 27 In the case of native servants, troops, and followers, it is important to prevent the discussion, in public, of any military matters, such as names or appointments of officers, strength and destination of Units, etc. Suspicious persons making any such enquiries should be immediately reported to the Brigade Staff or Assistant Provost Marshal. A warning is advisable that some shops are the resort of gamblers and other bad characters. Water supply.—ln Aden and Shaikh Othman there are only two sources of water supply—well water, which is brought into the former from the latter by a masonry conduit and by native water carts—and condensed water from the con densers in Aden. The existing condensers are capable of a maximum daily output of 100,000 gallons. 2. The well water is slightly brackish, but is drunk and preferred by all natives on account of its ' bite Water of both kinds is issued to troops on indent at a fixed scale by the Supplv and Transport Corps. Condensed water is carried by rail to Shaikh Othman. At Shaikh Othman certain wells are allotted to units for washing and watering animals. 3. Practically the whole of the civil population buy their water. Water being a saleable commodity, it is as well to taken precautions against traffic in water drawn a8 a free issue for officers or troops. Railway. -There is a metre gauge railway from Maaia fetatio to Robat (December 1916). ^ The accommodation of one train VSnk a. d Indian, Warrant or Non-Commissioned Officers, .100 Rank and File, 100 maunds luggage. CHAPTER VII. WATER SUPPLY. One of the greatest obstacles to successful military opera tions in Southern Arabia is the scarcity of water. Necessitv for economy of water.—Success in solving the pro- Wem of having sufficient to prevent hardship can only be attained by perfecting delivery to the troops, and rigid no my in its use by them. Men and animals must be trained in these hahits and to practice must be enforced by a elsewhere, too early and too copious dnnlang ' nc ^ 0 * ^ cr than alleviates the hardships of a long march It s however the water wasted rather than the water drunk which causes a general shortage. . , • u i +1^ Where to look for water. —Wyman-Bury in 00 ,• ' Land of Uz,' page 151, gives the following hints regarding water in South Arabia. A flat topped range of hills is unlikely to hold water. In ravines, try below the first big drop in the bed, or below anv likely place for a waterfall. Failing this go back to edge of the drop and look just above it—failing both, t e ravine is probably waterless. Dried sand may be worth boring into—water is often foum only a foot below. Shingle usually no good unless an imp meable stratum is found two feet down. Vegetation is not always a guide—water is rarely found near the false vine (selah) and tamarisk timber.12 near the brighter green tamarisk scrub, it is usually running water, brackish, and may be dnnkable. Purification of water. —The quality of the drinking water in the parts visited by the Boundary Commission of 1903 was, on the whole, good, and, though dysentery occurred, disease due to water cannot be said to have borne a large part in the general health of the troops. For means for purifying water see ' Medical, ' page 19. Well Water Supply at Shaikh Othman and Lahej and between the two. The villages best off for wells are Fiyush (J. 38) and aht (H. 68), Majhafa (B. 72) and Mahalla {4-7), (numbering refers to Lahej Delta Map, 3rd Edition, S. D. O. 1806. 1917), are large villages and probably have a fair supply. The wells in other villages are small and few details are known. There are possibly more wells in the Fiyush area than are gn en in the attached table. Waht has 5 wells, details unknown. There is ample well water supply at Shaikh Othman both for its own population (9,000 in time of peace) and for the aqueduct supply to Aden. Wells at Lahej number 20 to 25 and the supply is said to be ample and good. The dimensions given in the subjoined table are not con stant and none but recent measurements are reliable owing to the rapidity with which w ells get choked by sand. Conversely a disused and seemingly -dry well may possibly produce an ample supply if cleaned out.15 unless otherwise stated. MENT OF WELLS. Depth of water. 5 ft. 2i ft. 2 ft. 3 ft. • 2 ft. Capacity.

SPECIAL NOTES FOR VARIOUS BRANCHES. AERONAUTICS. Atmosphere.—Lsiiiev flights show that greater experience in the east has eliminated the difficulties due to overheating to a large extent. 2. Sites jor aerodromes and landings. —An excellent site for an aerodrome could be found in the vicinity of Khor Maksar. An aeroplane could land without difficulty in many places in tracts :— (а) North-east of Fiyush. (б) Shaikh 'Othman-Bir Ahmad-Hiswa (c) West of the Wadi Kabir from Bir Ahmad to line of W aht. 3. From reports as to general nature of the country about Thalab it would seem that a suitable site for an aerodrome should be obtainable without much difficulty in its vicinity. ARTILLERY. Native camel drivers.—The camel drivers of the Mobile Artillery are composed of Arabs, Somalis, and Indians, The Arabs appear to be far the best being, keen, intelligent, amenable to discipline, and with a good naik, who should, if possible, know English, do well. Indians give no trouble, are less intelligent than Arabs, but are only of use with Indian camels, which, unlike Arab camels, are not fed by hand. Somalis are indolent, and generally unsatisfactory. Hand feeding is a local custom and many local camels at first refused to feed themselves ; they can however be broken in to feeding themselves and this should invariably be done.19 MEDICAL. —From wells or from rivers. Purification of water. —Should be boiled for drinking pur poses or sterilized with chemicals. Alum will clear it a good deal and must be used before it can be sterilized. River water is more contaminated than that of wells. It is also likely to be more muddy. When taking water from a river it should be taken from centre of stream. Irrigation channels should be avoided. The water they contain is always highly contaminated. See also ' Water.' Malaria. Mosquito Nets. —Very prevalent and is certain to cause a good deal of sickness. Mosquito nets should always be used, but more especially within a mile of any village. It should be remembered that feet and ankles are liable to be bitten about sun-down. If shoes are worn, the ankles could be protected by wearing two pairs of fairly stout socks. Avoid camping near river beds and villages. In camping the vicinity of a river bed should be avoided and high and open ground chosen. It is particularly important to avoid camping in vicinity and to leeward of a village. All the inhabitants are potential carriers of malarial infection. Quinine parades—Malaria also occurred among troops, employed in the Hinterland in 1903-04, stationed near Hardaba and at Sulaik in the Sailat Hardaba as well as among those employed in the Kotaibi expedition, where camping near the river beds was a necessity, but to a less extent. Mosquitoes are common in all these parts. Little is known about the Bana the upper Bana at any rate does not bear a malarious repu tation, but the lower reaches are, no doubt,.unhealthy. With regard to the Yeramis valley, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Bent, who' passed up it in 1897, were brought back to Aden quite prostrated by malaria, and lay ill in hospital for several weeks. Mr. Bent's death, immediately on returning to-20 England, may be attributed to this illness. The malaria, -especially in the Tiban valley, is of a serious and sometimes a malignant kind. At the same time, it does not appear that this malarious belt extends very far from the river. The Boundary Commission# marched down the T iban in December 1903, from the Dakkam to near Musaimir. Camps were, where- ever possible, selected on the high plateaux several hundred feet above the river. Turning off near Musaimir, the Com mission passed two months near Ad-I)areja and above Hawaimi in the Wadi Natid. There was practically no malaria either among the personnel or the escort. Anopheles mosquitoes were observed, though not in large quantities, and no doubt in the rainy season the results would have been different. 1 ro- phylactic quinine parades were regularly held. Medicines required. —The fewer medicines brought the better. The following may be useful, if out of reach of a doctor :— Aperient pills. Quinine tabloids. Asperin. 'Chlorodyne. Keating. Dovers Powders 5 grain tablets. Zinc or other simple ointment (for chafes, etc.). Vermijelli. Supply and Transport. Supplies. —The Aden Hinterland provides fodder and wood 'for the population of Aden. A certain amount of fodder and wood would be obtainable for a force operating in Lahaj District. Beyond this practically the entire supplies for any force must be imported. Cattle, sheep and goats are obtained from Somaliland. Firewood is brought from several of the coast ports east and north of Aden. Stocks should be laid in against the monsoon season, June, 15t,h August, 31st, during which dhow traffic is much restricted.21 Transport. —The bulk of the 5,000 transport camels, which were hired in 1904-05, came from beyond the Protectorate borders. No reliable local transport is obtainable, more especially as the Arab owner is averse to all restraint, and of doubtful fidelity. All the hired transport taken to Lahaj in July 1915 bolted as oon as firing commenced. Veterinary. Fo( ider .—l. The only forms locally procurable are (a) ' Karbi ' fed green to horses and dry to camels, and # millet stalks very good for both. {b) ' Hariali ' grass in limited quantities is excellent but dear (lis. 3-8 per 80 lbs.). Horses and Mules. Minor ailments.—I. Jaundice and loss of condition are common amongst horses when not protected from the sun. 2 Pimples all over the body due to bites of camel ticks ; these are irritable, inducing rubbing and sores. The best treatment is soap and water, oily dressings are to be avoided as they collect dust and aggravate the complaint. 3. ' Horse Sickness ' is imported from the Hinterland, and affects horses, mules and donkeys. Shoeing. —None wanted for mules, and only on the forefeet for horses in the low lying and sandy country. Camels.— 1. A weekly wash in the sea keeps coats in good order. 2. A common cause of sofebacks is the neglect of Arao drivers to remove packs when their animals are at rest. 3 In spite of the assurances of Arabs to the contrary, the death rate of the Indian Camel in and near Aden has been 20 per cent, less than in India. 4. The Somali camel manages well without much grazing- 5 The local camel is small, and more adapted to draught than pack work Normally he is fed by hand, but can be taught to feed himself.22 I 6. Arab drivers are addicted to the needless firing of their camels for any complaint, a practice which is cruel and should be discouraged. Donkeys. —These are much used by the inhabitants but can only carry small loads, say 80 lbs. Veterinary. —Mange is very prevalent throughout, and is responsible for many break-downs. The Arab is often very careless about it in the earlier stages. Katran, a kind of native tar, much used in the Sudan, is as good a remedy as anything, and can be obtained at almost any Arab village. CHAPTER IX. MISCELLANEOUS. 1. Hints to officers. Kit, clothing, etc.—The following notes are put forward as suggestions based, in the main, on local experience. They are not intended to take the place of regulations. Aden and vicinity.— Thin tropical clothing is preferable. In the hills, inland—Thick warm clothing is advisable. Uote . If Base Depdte are formed in Aden, spare kit can be stored there till required. The following are some of the articles of kit recommended, chiefly for Aden and the plains. Various. —Mosquito net, sun and dustproof goggles, spine pad to button (and not tie on with tapes). Thin cotton or woollen vest of different colour to shirt. Uniform. —Khaki uniform to be of twill or puggree cloth and not of drill. Khaki shirts with turn down collar, shoulder straps with rank and unit badges, shorts, stockings and boots, with a halt length putties round the ankle to keep out the sand, h a \e been found to be a good service dress for operations near Aden.23 Helmet—(Must be well ventilated, both at top, and round forehead.) Some good form of thick pith sun topee. Note —Whiteaway, Lnidlaw &amp; Co., Bombay, sell an extra thick sun hat .called the ' Mesopotamia Topee ' at Rs. 6-12. Shoes for camp wear.—Light canvas rope sole boots or shoes for camp (which, if white, are easily coloured with khaki bianco). Also rope sole boots and shoes at Rs. 2-4 and Re. 1-4 respectively. Drink for Water bottle.— For the water bottle, an infusion of raw tea in cold water is medically recommended in preference to cooled tea prepared in the ordinary way. Servants and Shopping.—For articles of kit, uniform and servants, it is inadvisable to rely in any way upon Aden. 2. The riding camel. 1. He is hopeless on muddy ground. 2. In difficulties the nose rein is preferable to guide the •camel—at other times the neck rein or a stick is better. 3. A puttie wound round the rider's abdomen is recom mended for comfort in riding. 4 Blankets and rugs should be used to cover up all straps and buckles, likely to chafe the rider Paddmg on the back of the saddle being important, as the lower end of the spine is especially vulnerable. 5. The native saddle is said to be comfortable both for rider and camel. 6 The local camel is occasionally vicious and bites, strange camels should therefore be handled with caution. 3. Telegraph and signalling. A field telegraph was laid from Aden to Dhala during the •work of the Boundary Commission. It followed the line of the Hardaba route and the Naqil Rabad, and intermediate offices were established at Bir umm-Saifi, Nobat Dakim. and24 Jimil So much trouble was caused by the constant cutting I the line chiefly by the Kotaibi tribe, between Nobat Dakim i nS that this portion of the line was rolled up m July ^903 Snamng coL^nicatio,, was establiahed between Sa and Nubat Dakim by an intermediate party camped T '''''Xr' Ch%n J ten h „ U pMon Um wa a a ^edally ^ g r^r^^n^ n ^a—y bv^'eomiectbig'station on Jabalain from the Ma'adin valley. t .+ nrtis df the country, h 1 which troops were operating it would ^nearly always be possible to establish good connect - Ing stations^ although convenience of signa mg jh^ nlwava coincide with proximity of water, etc., and parties, large enough to resist attacks, might have to be detailed. 4. Miscellaneous. roimioe —The coin universally current in British Yemenis , r t ■ f Theresa dollar. The Indian 4-anna bit, locally called ' haula' has come to be the standard unit of division, five «haula '' going to the dollar.

It is taken as being the dollar atfecta the mter or j ^ „ the interior Mb ' ounVy rnpees are current, but the dollar is generally preferred. Common Weights and Measures are 16 Wakiya ... 1 Rat&gt; 1 lb '' . 1 Kasa 'I ^ m - r j coun t r y. . 1 Kela j . 1 Farasla. . 1 Kadba. 5 Rati 3 Kasa 28 Rati 80 Rati Of the above I be Farasla is a weight, pure and simple, the others arc also used as measures (usually ot grain).25 (9 The words Nus—(half), Ruba—(i), and Thanun---(l-8th) are commonly attached to these weights, e .g., Xus l , arasla= 14 Rati, Ruba Rati =4 Wakiya. At Lahej grain in email quantities is commonly measured in Paillee (or Thanun)=4^1bs. Hand Measure. 1 Dhand (or Dira). = 1,700 to 1,800 sq. yds (about ^rd acre)- 16 Dira= 1 Hhekl (Amiri couhtry). For calculating length of marches, etc., from native inform ation, nothing but practice and even acquaintance with the idiosyncrasies of a particular informant, are of much avail. Distances are of course measured by time, and the Arabs' notions of time, according to our ideas, are exceedingly vague, ' Sa'a ' or hour is a very elastic and misleading term. Dis tances naturally vary much with the going, but a caravan ' day ' may be taken from 10 miles to a maximum of 15 miles. (If it were a question of reaching water, the distance might be longer). A ' foot' day would vary from some 15 to 20 miles. A short march is often described as ' mughadda' literally from sunrise to the hour of the first meal, generally, taken about 9 or 10 a.m ., and would mean a march of some three or four hours' duration. The hours of prayer are often a rough guide. Al-Fajar .... Early dawn. Ad-Dhohr .... Noon. Al-'Asr . Al-Maghrib Nusf-ul-Lail 3-30 P. m. Sunset. Midnight. The following formulae to convert years of the Christian ■era to those of the Muhammadan era and vice versa may be of use :— Year of the Hijra = Year A. D. = (Year A. D.—621)x 537 521 Yoar of the HijrA x 521 1 537 . Note .—The Hijra, or 1st year of the Muhammadan era, was A. D. 621.26 CHAPTER X. PERSONALITIES OF NOTE. 1.

GAZETTEER. —An important town in Yemen, situated on a hill top at a crowfly distance of about 100 miles southward from Bm Sana'a ; by road it is 37 miles from Yarim and 47 miles from Qa'tabah, via Adarib and Araf. It is a walled town of typical stone-built houses and has a population v of some 4,000 souls. Ibb is in direct telegraphic communication with Sana'a, Ta'iz, and Qa'tabah. During 1916 it was the chief Turkish convalescent depot for the Yemen. Mokha {Lat. 12° 20' N., Long. 43° 14' E.) —Formerly the chief port in the Yemen for the coffee trade, but has now much diminished in importance. It is situated some 115 miles south by east from Hodaidah, and lies in a small bay between two low points, about IJ miles apart, on each of which are the ruins of a fort. Between these ruins extends the sea-wall which allows access to the town by a single gate only ; and in front of this gate is a stone pier or jetty, which, like the town itself, is in a state of utter decay. There is telegraphic communication with {a) Sana'a— via Ta'iz ; (b) Hodaidah— via Zabid. The telegraph line from Mokha to Zabid runs through Moshij and Hais, and not as shown on Hunter's map. Mukalla. —Next to Aden the principal port on the southern coast of Arabia, is situated about 300 miles east-north-east from Aden. The population was estimated by Hirsch ' at about the same as that of Shihr,' viz., 6,000, and is a very mixed one. Shihair, {She.hr). —A town on the Hadhramaut coast of southern Arabia, some 35 miles by road eastwards from Mukalla. It is one of the principal towns of the Ka'aiti family and was once the chief commercial port between Aden and Masqat, but has now been superseded by Mukalla. The population amounts to about 6,000 souls. Shuqrah. —A small village on the coast about 60 miles north -eastward from Aden. It is the principal port of the Fadhli territory. CHAPTER XH. COMMUNICATIONS. Boyond the settlement of Shaikh Othman, which may be said to be part of Aden, there are no roads, properly speaking,29 in the Aden Protectorate. There are, however, numerous camel tracks, of which thosn on the main caravan lines are, as a rule, in good order, and offer no difficulty to pack trans port. An epitome of the principal tracks leading west, east and north and some minor ones which are of tactical importance in, connection with the last are given below.
