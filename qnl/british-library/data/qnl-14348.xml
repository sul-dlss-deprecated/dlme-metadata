These orders disapproved of the payment of a bill for the Marine Agent, Stephen Watson Henshaw. The letter explains that this payment has been made anyway as it was made in favour of a native merchant, in order to maintain the respectability of the public office and that no further payments will be made without the authorisation of Government. William Bruce also further requests the approval for the payment of another bill for Mr Henshaw; the Government of Bombay rejected the bill for not being in the correct form, however it is claimed no new instructions have been received at Bushire regarding the submission of bills to Government.The letter further explains to Government that it is the opinion of the Acting Resident that the credit of the Residency should continue to be held in high regard, since HM Envoy to the Court of Persia is expected to need to draw on the Residency for funds.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023685574.0x000032#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
