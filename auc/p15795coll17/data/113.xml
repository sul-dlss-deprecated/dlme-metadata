A Harvard-educated American executive involved in the automotive business in Egypt, he joined AUC’s Board of Trustees in 1980, and gives a portrait of that generation of mainly US-based trustees. Hyde recounts the part he, along with other trustees and President Richard Pedersen, played in the 1980s in pushing to develop and orient the university toward professional programs like engineering. He indicates that the effort was motivated by the desire to improve AUC’s academic reputation and to attract male students, as female students had significantly outnumbered males. AUC’s improved financial situation in the 1980s is attributed to President Pedersen’s shifting AUC toward more emphasis on tuition for revenue rather than a dependence on US government funding, higher student enrollment, and the contributions of chief financial officer Vice President Andrew Snaith. Hyde speaks of his own role in university finances, as member and chair of the Board of Trustees’ Finance and Investment Committees, and later his position co-managing AUC’s Karnak Fund, which invested in Egyptian companies. He reports substantial growth in AUC’s endowment into the 1990s, and how this and the work of the Board’s Century Committee influenced the decision to build a new campus. Hyde discusses changes in the Board of Trustees in the 1990s and 2000s, such as the broadening of its membership to include more Egyptians and other foreign nationals, and the impact of leading members and successive Chairmen. An assessment of AUC’s presidents and provosts in this period is also offered, as well as Hyde’s perspective on how Egypt’s economy and politics affected AUC.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
