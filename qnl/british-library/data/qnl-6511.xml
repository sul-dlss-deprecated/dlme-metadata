Persian Gulf. Turkisli Garrison at El Bidaa, on the Arabian Coast. The annexed four Memoranda by the late Mr. A. W. Moore—the first dated 1st September 1879, the last 12th February 1884—treat very fully of the question of Turkish jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf aloDg the Arabian coast. The present Note relates solely to the position of the Turks at El Bidaa, and for the purpose of illustrating the relations existing between the Turks, the Sheikh of El Bidaa, and the Indian Government, the following extracts are taken from Mr. Moore's Summaries. From the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab to a point nearly opposite the island of Demam just south of Katif, between the 26th and 27th parallels of latitude, Turkish suzerainty is acknowledged. This is the sea line of the El Hasa province or district. South and east of Demam extends the El Katr (or Guttur) coast as far as lat. 24° 10', long. 53'. Along it is situated El Bidaa. The following account of this district, is extracted from a letter from the Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 4th September 1873 ;— ' It will be observed that there is an extensive cape or promontory called by the general name of Guttur, or properly Katr. The greater part of this tract is desert land, but a few Bedouin tribes find pasture for their flocks. On the coast are fishing villages, such as Zobarah, Khor Hassan, El Bidaa, &amp;c., the most considerable being Bidaa. The whole coast is called the Guttur coast, and the population is fluctuating. The question of the sovereignty over Guttur generally has never yet been decided. It has, perhaps, been a debatable land, between Oman on one side and the Wahabee power on the other. At one time the Chief of Aboothabee is said to have exercised authority in Guttur. Later the TJttoobees, having settled there and at Bahrein, became paramount. These, in turn, had to pay religious tithe to the 'Wahabee Ameer, who established a Governor of his own at Bidaa.' From longitude 53° the coast as far as the promontory of Ras-ul-Kheimah, generally known as the ' Pirate coast,' is occupied by the so-called ' Trucial Chiefs '' of Aboothabee, Debay, Shargah, Ejman, Amulgavine, and Ras-ul-Kheimah, belonging to the Beni Yas, Ab-boo Felasah, El-Joasim, and Abu Ali tribes of Arabs. In 1868 an agreement was signed between Colonel Pelly and Mahomed bin Thanee, the principal Chief of Guttur, by which the latter, although not a party to the maritime truce, bound himself not ' at any time to put to sea ' with hostile intention,' and to refer to the British Resident any dispute or misunderstanding which might arise. On the 22nd August 1871, Sir H. Elliott reported to Lord Granville,* that having received a telegram from the Viceroy of India, inquiring whether there was any ground for a report that Turkish troops were to be thrown upon the Guttur peninsula, and that fortresses were to be erected at Kateef and Ojair, he had communicated with Server Effendi, who declared that after looking through the correspondence he could not find any confirmation of the report. Sir H. Elliott added:—' The Turkish Government is not dis- ' posed to be particularly communicative when questioned upon their ' proceedings in what they regard as their own provinces,' i.e., Nejd and Yemen. With regard to Guttur, however, it is certain that, some time in the month of July, the Turkish flag, under circumstances nowhere clearly explained, was hoisted at El Bidaa, a port on the east coast of the peninsula. On this subject Mr. Aitchison made the following remark, in a Minute, dated the 19th July 1871f:—'The occupation [sic) of El Bidaa seems to be quite contrary to the spirit of the assurances given both by the Porte and the 17159.

' Pasha. It is no doubt the first step towards the establishment of supre- ' macy over the tribes to the east, whose towns, it will be remembered, have ' been entered in the local Turkish Gazette as being houses and gardens of ' the country of Nejd. The Turks are too cunning to make any violent and 41 sudden assertion of their supremacy over these regions.' ' There is, first, the insinuation of the Pasha that the assurances given ' refer to independent tribes, of whom there can be none in Xejd; then the ' entry in official papers of certain places as dependencies of Nejd ; then the ' hoisting of the Turkish flag, and so forth.' From the following extract from a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Government of India, dated 22nd August 1882, it would appear that a Turkish guard arrived at El Bidaa in 1872 :— ' The father of Shaikh Jasim was from the year 1868 under engagements to the British Govern ment, and personally continued up to the time of his death to maintain friendly relutions with the Residents. He had, however, for many years, on account of old age and decrepitude, resigned the management of his affairs and the affairs of the township to his son Jasim. The latter appeared in former years to entertain resentful feelings towards liritish authority, probably on account of certain action taken on behalf of Bahrain against the Katr Shaikhs, and, developing a talent for intrigue, procured the admission of a Turkish guard at El Bidaa in 1872. During the course of subsequent years Shaikh Jasim earned for himself the character of an intriguing, disaflected, and headstrong person, but his father, whilst alive, retained influence sufficient to prevent any serious difficultyDuring the past few years Shaikh Jasim has conceived a desire to recover his in dependence, and with this object has shown a disposition to resume closer relations with the British Government. In fact, I have full reason to believe that if he had been guaranteed against any interference of Turkish or other authority than the British in the affairs of El Katr, he would willingly have accepted the position of what is termed a 4 trucial Chief.' An assurance of pro tection was, however, indispensable to Jasim, and of course this could not be given. But it was considered desirable to encourage Shaikh Jasim to maintain friendly and intimate relations with the Resident, and by your letter, dated 28th April last, I was instructed to endeavour to obtain from him a verbal promise to observe the terms, so far as possible, of the engagement of 1868.' In September 1873 the Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf reported* that, since the Turkish occupation of El Hasa, the whole line of coast as far as Odeid had fallen under Turkish influence, that the Chiefs in general had been forced or induced to accept the Turkish flag, and that El Bidaa had been actually occupied by a body of Turkish troops.^ In 1874 the Bedouin tribe of the Beni Hajee obtained boats at El Bidaa, but were foiled in their meditated attack upon Bahrein and on Zobarah, a place on the Guttur peninsula, by the movements of Her Majesty's ships, and retired inland. The Turkish Government, through Musurus Pasha, remon strated against the action of the British naval authorities, and in his Note put forward a distinct claim to jurisdiction over the Guttur coast opposite Bahrein. On this point Colonel Ross, in his report (12th September 1874) to the Government of India, observed :— 'By the treaty of 1861 with the Chiefs of Bahrein the British Government undertake to give their support to the Chiefs in the maintenance of the security of their possessions against maritime aggreesions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of the Persian Gulf. It becomes a duty, therefore, firstly, to prevent as far as possible any Chiefs or tribes finding the opportunity of embarking in such aggressive enterprises; and secondly, if such a naval expedition should be found at sea by a British vessel of war, it would be the duty of such vessel to employ force against it. u Amongst preventive measures we have hitherto counted on the assistance of the various local Arab Chieftains of the Guttur coast in preventing boats being obtained or seized by marauding or piratically inclined Arabs, such Chieftains being given to understand that they will be held responsible in these matters for their immediate coast line. ' The Chiefs in question, including those of El Bidaa, have always hitherto acknowledged their responsibilities, and it has been customary to deal with them all direct for such purposes, and to this no demur has been made in any quarter. ' The port of El Bidaa is somewhat peculiarly situated as regards its political status. The old Chief, Mahomed bin Thani, himself uses the Arab flag, whilst his son, Jasim, has put himself under Turkish protection, and a guard of Turkish soldiers is kept at El Bidaa. It has not been declared however, as far as I can asceruin, that the Turkish authorities have assumed the Govern ment of that place. It is very probable they are not prepared to assume responsibility for the maritime proceedings of the Chiefs or people of Bidaa. At the same time, Jasim bin Mahomed at all events, if not his father, is prepared, if pressed, to evade responsibility by pleading his being under Turkish auihority.' In 1875 another event occurred indicative of the position assumed by the Turkd on the Guttur Coast. Two British Indian subjects, merchants at El Bidaa, were, by great pressure and in spite of their protest, compelled by the Turkish Pasha to wait upon him at Lansa (Huf-huf) in the interior.In the previous summer Colonel Ross had recovered from Mahomed bin Thanee, the Arab Sheikh of El Bidaa, an indemnity or account of a piracy on the Guttur coast. The connection between this gffair and that of the merchants will be best understood from the Resident's etter of 24th December 1875 to the Government of India, :i in which he wrote — * Political Lottar, No. 28, dated 4th Uns old Sheikh, whom we have hitherto continued to recognize and treat as the Chief of the February 1876. district of El Bidaa, has ever been sincerely friendly disposed towards the British Government and representatives, and ready so far as he safely could to show his friendship when occasion offered. He has at times even made indirect communications, with a view of privately sounding the Resident as to whether he might hope for the aid of the British Government in any attempt to rid himself of the, to him distasteful, incubus of Turkish domination. Such overtures were necessarily discouraged. ' The son of Mahomed bin Thanee, by name Jasim bin Mahomed, is animated by sentiments wholly opposed to those entertained by his father. This Jasim has always shown a jealous and even hostile spirit as regards British authority in the Gulf, and was greatly instrumental in bringing the Turks to El Bidaa. ' Coneequently the compliance of Mahomed bin Thanee with our just demand was distasteful to Jasim. This person further trades in pearls and other merchandise, and, wishing to get the whole traffic of Bidaa into his own hands, would gladly drive the Indian merchants from the place by any means in his power. 'I have scarcely a doubt that Jasim used the affair of the indemnity, and the visit of the Residency steamer to El Bidaa, as a means of working on the jealous feelings of the Turkish officials, and has made such representations as to the conduct of the Hindoos as have served to excite the anger of the Governor of Lahsa, and induced him to adopt the harsh and overbearing course of ordering Rama and Cheyla to be sent to Lahsa. 1 think, then, that Jasim bin Mahomed is the instigator of the outrage.' Lieutenant Fraser, the Assistant Resident, who was sent to El Bidaa to investigate the affair, reported that at this time Mahomed bin Thanee had no power whatsoever, the local authority being entirely in the hands of Jasim bin Thanee, his son, who was styled Kaimakam, that this title had been conferred upon him by the Turks, that he flew the Turkish flag, and acknowledged no other supremacy, and that the place was garrisoned by 45 irregular soldiers. In forwarding the papers on the subject to the Secretary of State, the Government of India observed :—'j- t Political Letter, No. 28, dated 4th February 1876. Views of the Government of India in 1876. ' The Turkish Government has, for some years past, been occupied in establishing its influence and power at El Bidaa, and that place may now be considered as incorporated with the Turkish dominions. 1 he authority of the Chief, Mahomed bin Thanee, has been transferred to his son Jasim, who is favourably inclined to Turkish rule, hoists the Turkish flag, and pays revenue to the Pasha at Lahsa. El Bidaa, which is a small fort on the east of the Guttur promontory, does not belong to any tribe having treaty relations with the British Government. So long, therefore, as the Chief commits no outrages by sea, and avoids interference with our allies, we have no solid ground to object to what extent he submits to Turkish authority, nor, in our opinion, have we any interest in objecting. Our policy is to keep clear of any complications that may arise upon the mainland.' In 1877 Rer Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople called the serious attention of the Turkish Government to the increase of piracy along the Guttur Coast, which had resulted from the extension of its authority in that quarter, and intimated that Her Majesty's Government would not permit the peace of the Persian Gulf to be disturbed by expeditions which either pro ceeded from ports, like El Bidaa, in actual Turkish possession, or were organized by tribes recognizing Turkish supremacy, and were despatched from the territories of independent Chiefs, too weak to prevent the abuse of their ports. The Turkish Government replied to the effect that the Governor General of the Vdayet of Busrah declared that nothing of the kind alleged had taken place, and that the most complete tranquillity prevailed. During 1 8 7 9-80 proposals made by the Government of India for a com- Memorandum, prehensive arrangement with the Turkish Government in reference to its P art in., pp. 1 territorial pretensions along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, and to the 10 19 - police of the seas in those parts, were under discussion with the Foreign Office and Her Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople, but they led to no result, the Turkish Government denying that piracy existed in the Persian Gulf. 18 0 £ a bove. In 1881 Colonel Ross reported that there was a Turkish guard about 130 tw 23 of above* strong at LI Bidaa, and that the Turkish flag was hoisted on the fort where the guard was stationed. 17159.

The Government of India having on the 30th October 1881 requested instructions as to the mture of their future relations with the Sheikh of El Bidaa, the Secretary of State replied as follows on the 20th January 1882 :— '2. The Chief in question El Bidaa] occupies apart of the coast where the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Sultan has not beei formally recognized by Her Majesty's Government, and is, in feet, little more than nominal; but he appears to fly the Turkish flag on shore and to have admitted a Turkish garrison into his fort. On the other hand, he is in constant communication with the British Resident in the Gulf: he has lately abandoned a contemplated maritime expedition to the neighbourhood of the Turkish port of Kateef, in deference to the remonstrances of that officer, to whose orders in such matters he professes his intention to submit, and he has explicitly stated that he regards the seas of those parts as being ' under the British Government.' ' 3. It seems, therefore, that, to whatever extent the Chief may have accepted the position of an Ottoman dependent, he, like his father before him, maintains very close and direct relations with the authorities of the Indian Government, and is prepared to defer to them in all matters affecting the peace of the seas. In the opinion of Her Majesty's Government this disposition on the part of the Sheikh should be encouraged. There is nothing in it incompatible with corresponding relations on his part with the Turks as regards his affairs on land, while, if he act up to his professions and abstain from ill treatment of British subjects, the precise nature of those relations may be a matter of comparative indifference to the Indian Government, whose consistent policy has been to restrict its interference with the tribes on the Arab coast—whether parties to the maritime truce or not— to the measures necessary to prevent hostilities at sea, and to hold aloof from their quarrels and concerns on the mainland. To this policy Her Majesty's Government desire to adhere. M 4 From the correspondence which has passed within the last two years on the subject of Turkish pretensions to jurisdiction along the Arab coast, it will be seen that, while Her Majesty's Government are not disposed to object to extension of the Sultan's authority over the tribes of the Katr peninsula, provided such authority be effectively exercised, it is their fixed deter mination neither to allow the Turkish local officials to use the quasi-independent tribes as instruments of aggression on Bahrein and the territories of the trucial Chiefs, nor permit the tribes to carry on piratical expeditions with impunity under the shelter of the Turkish flag.' In November 1882 Sheikh Jasim of El Bidaa, under a threat of a bom bardment of his fort by Her Majesty's ships ' Woodlark' and ' Arab,' paid a sum of Rs. 8,000 as compensation for the ill treatment of Hindoo traders at El Bidaa. The Turkish Grovernment protested against these proceedings as contrary to international law, and called for a refund of the indemnity exacted from Sheikh Jasim, who was styled ' Sous-Grouverneur ' of Katr. In answer to this complaint Lord Granville wrote to Musurus Pasha, on the 7th May 1883, that ' the claim of the Forte to rights of sovereignty over the ' Katr coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty s Government.'' The Turkish Ambassador, under instructions from the Porte, replied in terms which re-asserted the Sultan's sovereignty over the coast in question in the most uncompromising manner. In answer to this formal declaration. Lord Granville, in accordance with a suggestion from this Office,* wrote to Musurus Pasha that Her Majesty's Government were unable to accept the views of the Porte on the subject, as set forth in his note, and were not prepared to waive the right, which they had exercised at intervals during a long period of years, of dealing directly with the Arab Chiefs of the Katr coast, when necessary, in order to preserve the peace of the seas, or to obtain redress for outrages on British subjects or persons entitled to British protection.f In October 1887, the Viceroy telegraphed that the Sheikh of El Bidaa had been instigating piracies on the El Katr coast and injury to Indian traders at El Bidaa. The Political Resident held the Sheikh responsible for the disorders, and succeeded both in induciug him to pay compensation for losses sustained by British and Bahrein subjects, and in renewing friendly relations with the Sheikh himself. Colonel Ross had previously caused an embargo to be laid on the Sheikh's property at Bahrein. Colonel Ross also suggested that the withdrawal of the Turkish garrison from El Bidaa would conduce to the maintenance of security on the El Katr coast. The character of Sheikh Jasim is thus portrayed by Colonel Ross :— ' Sheikh Jasim has throughout his career been noted for his hot-headed disposition and tortuous dealings. He it was who, in a fit of ill-temper and dissatislnction with the policy of British authority, invited the Turkish authorities to place a guard at El Bidaa, a step which he has since repented of. Being himself the principal pearl merchant of El Katr, Sheikh Jasim and his immediate dependents view with jealousy and dislike the presence in El Bidaa of loreign traders who share with Jasim the profits of the pearl trade which he would fain monopolize. Of late he has had misunderstandings with the Turkish authorities, the particulars of which are not fully known. It seems, however, that the Turks proposed to institute a Custom House at El Bidaa, which project gave offence. Sheikh Jasirn was also disappointed and annoyed because he failed toecover through Turkish intervention the amount of the fine levied from him for ill-treatment of British subjects. Irritated alike against Turks and other foreigners, Jasim removed to a place about eight miles distant from El Bidaa, announcing that he washed his hands of its affairs, and was no longer Governor. This step of Jasim's was, however, a mere manoeuvre, and was taken with a view to creating disorders, and at the same time disavowing his responsibility for them. From his country residence he secretly instigated the disturbance resulting in the plunder and expulsion of the Persian traders residing in El Bidaa, and the wounding of the Hindus. The piracies off El Katr were also the natural result of Jasim's attitude and utterances. It is certain that without the signal from Jasim none of these untoward events could have happened.' The Porte protested against the seizure at Bahrain of property belonging to Sheikh Jasim, who was described as ' Sous-Gouverneur de Kauhaur*' and a ' fonctionnaire de TEmpire.' As the Turkish Note appeared to assert by implication a claim to sovereignty over Bahrain, Viscount Cross concurred Letters to Foreign in the Marquis of Salisbury's opinion that the Turkish Government should Office, dated 5th be courteously but distinctly informed that Her Majesty's Government refuse i 1 ^ 1 Mh Apnl to admit that claim, and that they regard the Chief of Bahrain as an independent ruler with whom they are in treaty relations. The Secretary of State has now to deal with the following telegram of the 2lBt June from the Viceroy :—' Following telegram received from Ross, ' dated 18th June :—'Turkish guard at Bidaa increased to about two com- ' 4 panies regular infantry. I venture to recommend that Her Majesty's ' ' Government should address Porte regarding the movement of troops to ' * Katr. Circumstances render probable (that) further extension of Turkish ' ' influence will be shortly effected in Oman direction unless some under- ' ' standing is come to.' Any such extension must prove seriously detri- ' mental to our interests at all times,, and may prove exceptionally inopportune ' at present in view of possible complications in Muscat.' It will have been seen from the above that the presence of Turkish troops at El Bidaa has never yet been made the subject of complaint, official or otherwise, on the part of Her Majesty's Government. It will, however, be consistent with the declaration of 7th May 1883 to maintain that the FwAr p. 4 of this continued presence of a Turkish garrison at El Bidaa is tantamount to an Memorandum, assertion of Ottoman sovereignty on the El Katr coast which Her Majesty's Government have refused t^) admit. The previous correspondence does not favour the idea that the Turkish Government, on receiving a remonstrance from Her Majesty's Government, will abandon their pretensions to sovereignty over this part of the Arabian coast or withdraw their garrison from El Bidaa. One of the difficulties of the situation, as far as we are concerned, is that the Sheikh is an independent Chief, not a party to the Maritime Truce,' and presumably within the exercise of his own rights in inviting the Turks to garrison his fort. Nevertheless, any advance of the Turks eastwards in the direction of Oman territory is inimical to our interests, and should be checked. We might, therefore, ask the Foreign Office whether diplomatic pressure cannot be put upon the Turkish Government to induce them to withdraw their soldiers from El Bidaa. E. N.
