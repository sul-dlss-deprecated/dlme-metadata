It endeavours to summarize the evidence, and not to discuss it. No attempt has been made to deal with the petrology or the fossils, but the bibliography gives references to the chief literature on both. Some reference to the fossils has been necessary in considering the stratigraphical problems of the oil-fields. The country is of especial geological interest, and has many unsolved problems, such as the correlation of the Mesozoic and Kainozoic deposits ; the age of the schists of the Zagros (which Loftus considered as altered rocks of comparatively recent date) ; the further study of that remarkable fossil Loftusia, of which further specimens would be helpful; the origin of the ' tangs ' ; and the geology of the little-known parts of the Arabian plateau to the west of Mesopo tamia. The problems of the economic geology of greatestNOTE present interest are those connected with the distri bution and correlation of the oil-bearing beds, and the relation of those of the Euphrates and the Mosul series to those of the oil-producing Ahwaz district. It is hoped that new evidence from Mesopotamia will soon solve many of its still open problems.CONTENTS page I. The Geological Position op Mesopotamia . 9 II.

INTRODUCTION THE GEOLOGICAL POSITION OF MESOPOTAMIA Mesopotamia might be expected, from its general geological relations, to be a country of great political importance. The long mountain belt that trends east and west across Europe and Asia projects southward into proximity with three great plateaus, which are remnants of a former tropical continent. These ancient plateaus are Africa south of the Atlas region, Arabia, and the peninsula of India. Between them and the mountain belt is a chain of basins and great valleys extending from the Mediterranean to the Indo-Gangetic plain that separates the Himalaya from the Indian peninsula. Mesopotamia occupies a corresponding position between the fold-mountains of Persia and the plateau of Arabia. It is a great valley whose sides are very varied in geological structure and composition. On the South-western side it is bounded by the Archean rocks of Arabia. To the north-east rises the front of the Persian plateau, which consists of parallel mountain ranges formed of folded rocks belonging to many diffe rent ages. To the north the Mesopotamian plains rise slowly till they end at the foot of the Taurus and the mountains of Armenia, which are even more varied in composition than the Persian wall. The differences between the Archean and Persian sides of the Mesopotamian valley are increased by the climate. Arabia is an arid country, with a very limited rainfall and no powerful streams ; its surface is there fore fairly uniform as it is smoothed by desert denuda tion. The mountain-slopes of Persia are under condi-10 GEOLOGICAL POSITION OF MESOPOTAMIA tions especially favourable to rapid rock decay ; the snows on the mountain summits give rise to powerful torrents in the spring, while the slow discharge from the porous limestones maintains perennial rivers: hence the edge of the Persian highlands is dissected by numerous canyons and valleys, through which rivers and the occasional torrential rains wash vast quantities of debris to the plains. Owing to the abundant supply of this material the Persian Gulf has been shortened by at least 250 miles ; and the thick rich soils of these alluvial deposits when adequately watered are extremely fertile. The area which best corresponds to Mesopotamia geographically is the Indo-Gangetic plain, which has the advantages of a dense industrious population and a heavier rainfall; but the importance of Mesopotamia in classical times shows its great possibilities when its magnificent natural advantages, its exceptional variety of materials, and its abundant useful minerals are adequately used.II THE GEOLOGY OF MESOPOTAMIA The geology of Mesopotamia is unusually simple. Lower Mesopotamia consists of the unbroken flood- plain of the Euphrates and the Tigris. This vast plain is about 300 miles long by an average of about 70 wide, and it is almost entirely composed of recent alluvial deposits. (I) The Advance into the Persian M/.—This part of the country occupies a former extension of the Persian Gulf, which has been filled up by sediments brought by the rivers from the mountains of Persia and Armenia or blown by the winds from the Arabian deserts. The delta is being extended into the sea more rapidly than any other known delta. According to Kawlinson (1857, p. 186/%. ; 1862, p. 5) the delta now advances a mile every 70 years; and during the historic period it has advanced a mile in every 30 years. Ainsworth (1822, pp. 105, 194) reported that the alluvium had advanced the shore of the Persian Gulf 30 yards per annum. Loftus (1857, p. 282) adopted the slower rate of growth of a mile every 70 years, or 25 yards a year. Pilgrim (1908, p. 57) quotes the conclusion of Barns that the Shatt el-'Arab, the joint outlet of the Euphrates and the Tigris, carries into the Gulf 25,600 million cubic feet of sediment every year, an estimate based on the assumption that during a third of the year it carries one-third of its volume of solid matter. The Karun, as its mountain sources are comparatively near, has been advancing its delta at 546 ft. (de Morgan, 1900, p. 13) a year, or three times the rate of that of the Shatt el-'Arab.12 GEOLOGY OF De Morgan (1900, pp. 4-23) has summarized the classical evidence as to the changes in the position of the seaward end of the delta since early Assyrian times. Nearchus, who piloted the fleet of Alexander the Great from the Indus to the Euphrates in 326-325 b.c., has left distinct records as to the position of the coast at the head of the Persian Gulf ; and his statements show that at that date the four rivers, the Karun, Karkeh, Tigris, and Euphrates, all entered the Persian Gulf indepen dently. According to a map by de Morgan the rivers discharged into a great lagoon which was divided from the Gulf by a line of bay-head islands, and the edge of Strait o 656 Feel Vertical Scale -» i Fig. 2. Gradient of the Floor of the Persian Gulf on a line from the north of the Shatt el-'Arab to the Gulf of Oman. the delta was along the broken line on fig. 2. 1 The position of the coast-line more than three centuries earlier is indicated by the dotted line on fig. 1, which is based on the records of the naval expedition of Sennacherib in 696 B.C., when his army descended the Tigris and Euphrates to invade Elam. The delta of Lower Mesopotamia is six times larger than that of the Nile, and its size and the long shallow bank which prolongs it into the 'Persian Gulf (fig. 1, above) are both due to the enormous quantity of sedi ment carried by the flood-waters of the Euphrates and Tigris. • (2) The Gradient of the Plains. —The delta passes 1 Considering, however, the strength of the rivers, larger channels through these islands would be expected than are shown on de Morgan's sketch-map.MESOPOTAMIA 13 inland to the great Mesopotamian flood-plain, which rises inland with a gentle and fairly even slope, though with one step upward near the boundary between Lower and Upper Mesopotamia. The Royal Geographi cal Society's map of Eastern Turkey-in-Asia (1910) marks Birijik on the Euphrates as at the height of 1,115 ft. ; according to Chesney (1850, vol. i, p. 46) the length of the Euphrates below that locality is 1,117 miles, so the fall would be a foot in the mile. Measure ments by Sir William Willcocks (1911, pi. 7) assign the Euphrates from Hit (164 ft.) to Shandy eh a fall of 121 ft. in 227 miles or 1 in 10,000. From Baghdad to the sea the distance according to Willcocks is 562 miles (Willcocks, 1911, pp. 27, 29), and according to the Persian Gulf Pilot (1915, p. 294) 606 miles; as Baghdad is at the level of 115 ft. the former length gives the Lower Tigris a gradient of only 1 in 26,000. Above Baghdad the level rises more quickly, for from Baghdad to Shereimiyeh, a distance of 177 miles, there is a rise of 246 ft. or 1 in 3,800. The steeper gradient of the Tigris than of the Euphrates helps to explain its greater activity, and is in itself due to the proximity of the high country along the Persian frontier, which has led to the more rapid accumulation of fluviatile deposits. Similarly the Karun River, the last tributary from the Persian mountains, has built up a delta which is well raised above the deposits of the Euphrates-Tigris. (3) The Discharge of the Rivers and their Load of Silt.— The Euphrates receives no perennial tributary after it has lost sight of the mountains. Numerous long wadis descend from the Ardh el-Wadyan (' the land of the wadis '), the eastern side of the Arabian plateau ; but they are generally streamless, though they are occupied by occasional floods during the winter rains. The Tigris, on the other hand, owing to the heavier rain upon the Persian mountains, receives numerous ever-GEOLOGY OF flowing tributaries, and thus its volume is steadily increased, and it contributes the larger share to the joint discharge of the Euphrates-Tigris through the Shatt el-'Arab into the Persian Gulf, According to the measurements by Chesney in 1835-7 the discharge of the Euphrates at Hit was 72,804 cubic ft. per second, and that of the Tigris at Baghdad 164,103 cubic ft. per second. De Morgan (1900, p. 6) quotes estimates by Rennie that the main flow of the Tigris at Baghdad is about 164,000 cubic ft. per second, that of the Euphrates at Hit about 72,000 cubic ft. per second, and the total of the joint rivers through the Shatt el-'Arab about 280,000 cubic ft. per second. This estimate appears exaggerated, since five years' records by the British river-gauge at Baghdad indicate that the Tigris from 1906-11 had a mean daily discharge of nearly 42,000 cubic ft. per second, and that of the Euphrates, accord ing to the measurements by Sir William Willcocks, is 38,500 cubic ft. per second, a total for the two rivers of 80,500 cubic ft. per second. The flow varies from the maximum for both rivers of 200,000 cubic ft. per second in April to the minimum of 24,700 cubic ft. per second in October (Willcocks, 1911, p. 9). The proportion of sediment in the flood-water is very high. The tests by Ainsworth (1838, p. Ill) showed that the Euphrates water at Birijik in December and January contained one part in eighty by volume of solid matter ; and after it left the Lamlum marshes (now dry), which acted as a filter, the proportion of sediment in October was one in two hundred. 1 Accord ing to Willcocks (p: 66) the ordinary water of the Euphrates contains 28-4 parts of suspended matter per 100,000. The Tigris in flood contains 755 parts per 1 This part of the Euphrates is now filtered by the marshes along the Hindiyeh branch, and especially by a reedy lake known as the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh, between Kufeh and Shinafiyeh village.mm (D MESOPOTAMIA 15 100,000, whereas the Nile water in a corresponding flood contains only 170 parts per 100,000. The bulk of the dissolved salts are bicarbonates of lime and magnesia, and some potash. The suspended matter in the Tigris contained 0T9 per cent, of phosphoric acid. (4) The Alluvial Deposits and Broads. —Owing to their heavy burden of silt both rivers have in places raised their beds above the level of the adjacent land, and in flood they break through their banks and inundate vast tracts of country. Thus in the flood of January 1896, when the Tigris rose 8 ft. in one night, the country around Baghdad was covered by a lake 25 miles long by 6 miles wide, and the water rose above the level of the city, which was protected by its artificial bank. The depressions left between the belts of slowly rising ground along the rivers form shallow lake basins, such as Lake Habbaniyeh below Hit, and 'Aqarquf to the west of Baghdad. These basins are refilled from time to time by floods. They occupy hollows left in nearly filled estuaries, and therefore belong to the class of lakes known as broads, after those beside the Norfolk rivers. According to Loftus the alluvial deposits by the Euphrates and Tigris consist partly of clay and partly of sand. He divides the clays into two divisions: the freshwater and the^ marine ; but he regarded some of the fossil shells in northern Upper Mesopotamia as also belonging to the alluvium, though they probably belong to a pre-Pleistocene formation. (5) The Older Deposits. —The alluvial deposits are interrupted by extensive outcrops of older beds, such as the conglomerates of Beled on the Tigris, 84 miles along the river above Baghdad ; at Qadisiyeh a few miles above Beled ; and from Zobeir near Basra north westward to the Euphrates at Suq esh-Shuyukh (Loftus, 1856, p. 152). At Beled the conglomerates rest upon a sheet of clay. The conglomerate is probably of Pliocene age and16 GEOLOGY OF belongs to the Bakhtiyari Series. 1 There does not appear to be any definite palaeontological evidence for this determination ; it is possible that both it and the underlying clay belong to the Pleistocene, though this is improbable as the flood-plain deposits are almost free of pebbles, and these gravels are of considerable thickness. Loftus has described a section made for a canal at Nejef, which exposed 12 ft. of a fine gravel composed of small white quartz pebbles in a reddish calcareous marl; this bed lies upon 40 ft. of gravel com posed of similar quartz pebbles in a friable calcareous earth. He reports, also, that the underground irriga tion canals, or qandts, are excavated in gravel to the depth of 65 ft. The flood-plain deposits are almost devoid of pebbles, so that the conglomerates doubtless belong to the Bakhtiyari beds. If so, the clays would belong to the underlying Ears Series (Miocene), though the clays which form the foundation of Baghdad may be Pleistocene. The conglomerates are also found at Samarra, where they are associated with limestone. A limestone which is chemically similar occurs at Hit on the Euphrates and is therefore probably Lower Miocene. Analyses of these rocks by A. Lucas are quoted by Willcocks (1911, pp. 93, 94, 92) as follows : Clay Underlying Conglomerate at Samarra % Silica ....... 39-90 Alumina with a little oxide of iron. . . 20-07 Lime ....... 16-75 Magnesia ....... trace Loss on ignition, being combined water with a little organic matter . . . .23-49 100-21 1 The use of a capital initial for the terms Group, System, Series, Stage, Era, Period, Epoch, and Age, indicates that they are being used in their technical sense for a definite geological subdivision.MESOPOTAMIA 17 Limestone from Samarra on the Tigris Silica and insoluble matter .

MES. ,,18 GEOLOGY OF The conglomerates are exceptional on the great flood- plain, and most of the country consists of tracts of marshy alluvium interrupted by areas of sandy desert and stony desert; these areas probably occur where Miocene beds outcrop as low plateaus of gypsiferous marls. One of these exposures of gypsiferous marl forms a ridge which trends north-north-west by south- south-east, and between Museyib and Baghdad accord ing to Loftus (1855, p. 256) is about a mile wide. Miocene outcrops also occur west of Basra, between the Euphrates and the Tigris to the south-west of Baghdad near Hilla, the ancient Babylon, and in an extensive desert platform to the west of the Euphrates south of Hilla around Nejef, and to the west of the Bahr-i-Nejef. (6) Upper Mesopotamia. —As the country rises from Lower to Upper Mesopotamia the geology becomes more varied. The boundary between Upper and Lower Mesopotamia is marked by the ancient Median Wall, which extended from the Euphrates to the Tigris, where the rivers come near together to the north-west of Baghdad. The division is approximately marked by a rise in the land, which is especially conspicuous along the course of the Tigris. Upper Mesopotamia, or Jezlreh, lies between the Euphrates from Hit to Birijik and the Tigris from Baghdad to above Mosul, and it extends north-west to the foot of the Taurus at Mardin. The mountain border of Upper Mesopotamia begins with the Jebel Hamrin to the north-east of the Tigris ; this long range of hills is composed of gently folded sandstones, conglomerates, and gypsum beds. Therange begins about 60 miles north-north-east of Baghdad and ciosses the Tigris above Shereimiyeh, and is continued by some lower hills into the Jezlreh. Near Mosul a range of hills, similar in composition to the Jebel Hamrin, begins with the same trend on the south-MHIWiMBWI a, or MESOPOTAMIA 19 western bank of the Tigris ; the river apparently flows there along a fault-plane between the Pliocene Bakhti- yari conglomerates to the north-east and the Lower Miocene gypsum beds to the south-west. Farther to the north-west this range is capped by basalt; it bends sharply and is continued as the Jebel Sinjar on a course trending from east-north-east to west-south-west. The Jebel Sinjar consists of a ridge of basalt overlying Miocene rocks. Schweiger-Lerchenfeld's map (1876, Part II, pi. 3) shows that the basalts have a wide ex pansion along the Tigris to the north-east of the Sinjar Hills. The streams down the southern slope of the Jebel Sinjar are lost in the plains between the Tigris and Euphrates. Still farther to the west and on a line slightly to the north is the Jebel 'Abd el-'Aziz ; and still farther north, beyond the line between Urfeh and Mardln, the country rises into the mountainous foot hills of the Taurus. These mountains are composed mainly of Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene beds, with some basaltic lavas which flowed from the great volcano of Qarajeh Dagh (6,070 ft.), which rises at the north-western angle of the Mesopotamia!! sunkland. Between Mardln and Diarbekr Oswald (1912, p. 9) has recorded the presence of Gault ammonites, but most of the country around Diarbekr consists of volcanic rocks, through which the Tigris has cut a canyon 300 ft. deep. Ascending the Euphrates, alluvial deposits are left sooner, after entering Upper Mesopotamia, than on the Tigris ; for a short distance above Hit the river has cut through a block of Upper Cretaceous rocks. They were discovered by Ainsworth (1838, p. 79), and were further examined during Cernik's expedition of 1872-3, when fossil fish were found in the Jebel el-Khiyam west of Anah (Schweiger-Lerchenfeld, 1875, Part I, p. 19). The Cretaceous beds below Anah are partly Turonian, but B 220 GEOLOGY OF to the north-west of Anah they are mainly Senonian. Above this Cretaceous area, the great western bend of the Euphrates past Birijik and near Samsat is occupied by Miocene beds, which are succeeded to the north by extensive areas of volcanic rocks. These lie on both sides of the Taurus Mountains, through which the Euphrates has cut its way in a series of magnificent canyons. (7) Summary of the Geological Structure. —The geo logical subdivision of Mesopotamia therefore agrees with its geographical division into two provinces—the Upper and the Lower. Lower Mesopotamia is, in the main, the formation of the Euphrates and the Tigris. Upper Mesopotamia consists in the south of upland plains broken by the basalt plateau to the north-west of Mosul and its western prolongation, the Sinjar Hills; it is composed in the north and west of outliers from the Taurus and of vast delta fans of debris that has been washed down from its mountainous borderlands. (8) The Stability of the Mesopotamian Climate during Historic Times. —The problems connected with the accumulation of the Mesopotamian flood-plain and of the denudation of the surrounding mountains raise the question whether there has been any material change of climate in Mesopotamia during historic or recent geological times. If the climate had been wetter in the past, the country might have been covered with a con tinuous turf, and denudation would then have been less rapid in spite of the greater volume of the rivers. But neither the geological nor historical evidence indicates any considerable recent change in the climate. During the period which was probably coincident with the glaciation of north-western Europe, when the Dead Sea covered the Jordan basin as a great inland freshwater sea, the rainfall was doubtless heavier throughout Turkey-in-Asia than it is at present. This pluvial period»v MESOPOTAMIA 21 had, however, passed away in prehistoric times and left Mesopotamia with an arid climate and treeless plains. It is true that W. S. Blunt (in Blunt, 1881, vol. n, p. 276) supports his pessimistic views as to the prospects of profitable irrigation in Mesopotamia by the conclusion that the rivers formerly had less extreme variations of flood and low water, and, owing to their more regular flow through the year, were more easily controlled. Such conditions would naturally have existed, had the surrounding countrybeen more wooded ; and there are some ancient records which might be taken to imply that some now treeless districts were then forested. Thus the sacred trees delivered to the flames by the soldiers of Assurbanipal grew where there are no trees to-day. But J. de Morgan, a leading authority on the archaeology of Mesopotamia, con cludes (1900, p. 31) that they were artificial forests carefully tended and watered, and maintained from a religious sentiment. That view, which is consistent with the general archaeological evidence, assumes that the climate during the Babylonian empire was much the same as it is at present. The former dependence of the country on irrigation is shown by the innumerable ancient channels, and according to Willcocks the amount of water then as now was adequate for the irrigation of only part of the irrigable land.Ill GEOLOGY OF THE PERSIAN GULF T he south-eastern extension of the Mesopotamian depression is occupied by the Persian Gulf, the floor of which shows the gradual encroachment of the estuarine deposits for 170 miles from the mouth of the Shatt el- Arab. The sea-bed for that distance descends steadily, except for two steep breaks, to the depth of 200 ft. ; the floor then continues for 210 miles at about that depth until it begins its steep descent, with a slight rise in the Strait of Hormuz, to the deep depression of the Gulf of Oman (fig. 1, page 12). It is from the geology of the shores of the Persian Gulf that the best evidence can be obtained as to the probable structure of the country beneath the Meso potamian plain. The chief contributions to the geology of the Persian Gulf are those by Carter (1850, 1852, 1853, 1857, 1859-60) and Blanford (1872, 1876), and, in later times, the important memoir by Dr. H. G. E. Pilgrim (1908) of the Geological Survey of India. (1) The AvchedTi: Hcitcit Series. —The oldest known rocks of the Persian Gulf are those named by Pilgrim the Hatat Series. They consist of mica-, hornblende-, chlorite-, calc-, and quartz-schists and of brown, green, and purple quartzites. These rocks are regarded as of Archean age and are probably an exposed outpost of the ancient foundation of Arabia. The Hatat Series is exposed in two outcrops to the south and south-west of Muscat. (2) The Oman Series. —The Hatat schists are inter-GEOLOGY OP THE PERSIAN GULF 23 folded with the overlying Oman Series, which consists of slates, cherts, and limestones. It forms the main mountain range of Oman, the Jebel Akhdhar, which constitutes the peninsula of Musandam and extends first southward and then south-eastward behind the south-western shore of the Gulf of Oman. Pilgrim collected in the Oman Series, near the Wadi 'Adai, six miles south-west of Muscat, some corals, brachio- pods, and bryozoa, amongst which Diener has identified Lonsdaleia and other genera which show that the rocks represent the Middle Productus limestones of the Salt Range of India. These fossiliferous beds are clearly Carboniferous, but the age of the associated unfossili- ferous slates and cherts is somewhat uncertain; and Pilgrim regards the Oman Series as ranging in time from the Carboniferous to the Trias. (3) The Igneous Series of Oman.—The Oman Series is succeeded by some igneous rocks which include in trusions of gabbro, diorite and diabase, and some lava flows. Some of the intrusive rocks have been altered to epidiorite and serpentine. As the rocks were in truded into the Oman Series and are earlier than the Upper Cretaceous, they are regarded as probably belonging to the end of the Jurassic. They may, however, be Lower Cretaceous. (4) The Cretaceous. —The Hippuritic limestone of Persia and Oman is found along the Arabian coast to the south-east of Muscat and on the northern side of the Persian Gulf near Khamlr. It also occurs in the high Persian ranges in the district around Shiraz, to the north-east of the northern end of the Persian Gulf. The widespread Cretaceous limestones of Persia have been shown by the collections of de Morgan to range from the Aptian to the Danian ; the Hippuritic lime stone of Khamlr near Bandar 'Abbas is probably Senonian since its fossils include Exogyra matheroni,24 GEOLOGY OF Orb. The Cretaceous sequence in the Persian Gulf begins, however, with the Cenomanian transgression, which carried the sea in Oman against the older rocks of Arabia. The Cenomanian beds are exposed at Has Fartak and Ras Sharwein in south-eastern Oman, and they have yielded abundant echinoids such as Pseudo- diadema roemeri, Des., Salenia scutigera (Munst.), 1 Salenia petalifera (Br.), Holaster cenomanensis, Guer., and Cottaldia carteri, Dune. (5) The Eocene, (i) The Lower Eocene: Hormuz Series. —The Cretaceous marine deposits, which were spread over much of Persia, were followed by the vol canic rocks of the Hormuz Series. They are certainly later than the Hippuritic limestone, with which they are closely associated at Khamlr. They are earlier than the Middle Eocene; so they are probably Lower Eocene. Some of the lava flows were probably submarine. They are associated with rock-salt and gypsum, and they built up a ridge which separated the Middle Eocene seas of Persia to the north-east from that of the Bahrein district to the south-west. (ii) The Middle Eocene : Nummulitic Limestone.— The great earth movements which led to the Hippuritic limestone being succeeded by the Hormuz lavas sub divided the Eocene sea into three basins: one of them covered most of southern Persia ; a second occurred in Oman and along the southern coastlands of Arabia; and the third occupied the Bahrein district and perhaps extended north-westward into Arabia. The chief rock belonging to the Middle Eocene is the nummulitic limestone, which, with its associated beds, is estimated by Pilgrim as at least 6,000 ft. in thickness. A fine section of the series is exposed on the route from Ahwaz Brackets beside the author of a specific name indicate that he placed the species in some other genus than that in which it is now included.wmuamnmam ^n, and as (Munst,)' THE PERSIAN GULF 25 to Isfahan. The beds appear to be conformable to the Cretaceous, the upper surface of which shows, however, marked erosion. The apparent conformity is therefore probably a case of disconformity. 1 The fossils are scanty and poorly preserved, except the Nummulites, which are of the same age as those of the Khirthar beds of India. They are therefore Middle Eocene in age, but they perhaps include some repre sentatives of the Libyan or Lower Eocene of the eastern Mediterranean. In the Oman region the Middle Eocene rests on the upturned edges of the Oman Series. They sometimes rest on laterites, which are probably old land deposits of the lower part of the Middle, or perhaps the upper part of the Lower, Eocene. The chief fossils are NuTUTnulites and Assilina leymeviei (Arch, and H.) and various echinoderms. Mr. R. B. Newton (1905, p. 158) has recorded the gastropod. Campanile, from Bandar Jissah (Qatar) on the Arabian coast. At Misluk the species of Nummulites found include N. gize- hensis (Ehr.) var. lyelli, Arch. &amp; H., a typical Middle Eocene fossil, and also N. laevigata, Lam. The Bahrein Sea is best known from the deposits at Bahrein Island, which consist mainly of chert-bearing marls and white limestones. They include Nummulites gizehensis (Ehr.), Schizaster mokattamensis, Lor., and Spondylus aegyptiacus, R. B. Newt., so that the fossils indicate a Middle Eocene age ; the lithological re semblances of the chert-bearing marls to those of the Libyan Series or Lower Eocene of Cyrenaica, is worthy of notice, as it may indicate that both the Lower and Middle Eocene Series are present. (6) The Oligocene. —Oligocene deposits appear to be represented along the Persian Gulf by sandstones which That is, the beds are separated by an interval of time, but have the same inclination.26 GEOLOGY OF are intercalated with limestones and chert. They occur at Khamir and at Shushtar, where was found a fossil fish, Isurichthys orientalis, A. S. W. 1 , and according to Smith Woodward the other fossil species of this genus is Oligocene. At Khamir the limestones contain Num- mulites intermedia, Arch., and are therefore correlated by Pilgrim with the lower Nari beds of India ; they are probably Tongrian or Lower Oligocene. (7) The Miocene : Fars Series. —The Miocene beds are the most important on the shores of the Persian Gulf and the borders of the Mesopotamian sunkland. They include most of the gypsiferous series of Loftus. These are estimated by Pilgrim as at least 17,000 ft. in thick ness. He divides them into three divisions: the basal gypsiferous series, the plateau beds with Alectryonia virleti, and, above, the Pecten vasseli beds. The basal gypsiferous series are 1,000 ft. in thickness and consist mainly of interbedded sandy limestones and clays, with gypsum in beds 10 ft. thick. The presence of occasional pebbly beds, as at Qishm Island, indicates the proximity of land. At Khamir these gypsum beds rest on the nummulitic beds containing Nummulites sublaevigata, A. and H., of Tongrian or Lower Oligocene age. The two series appear to be conformable ; but at Shalil the gypseous beds rest on beds containing Clypeaster depres- sus, Sow., a characteristic fossil of the Gaj Series of India, which is Burdigalian or Lower Miocene. Some of the basal gypsiferous beds also contain Echinolampas jacquemonti, A. and H., another Gaj species. Pilgrim therefore concludes that these gypsum beds are equiva lent to those of the Mediterranean Schlier or Langhian beds, which are a special facies of the Burdigalian (Lower Miocene) due to deposition in lagoons. This question is considered in a later section (pp. 78-84). 1 A. Smith Woodward, Cat. Foss. Fish Brit. Mus., vol iv 1901 p. 453.THE PERSIAN GULF Pilgrim, however, rejects the view that the gypsum was laid down as direct precipitates from evaporating lagoons. He legards it as due to the action of sulphur ous volcanic vapours upon beds of limestone ; but, though he may have strong evidence for this theory, that stated in his report is unconvincing. The plateau beds of the Miocene consist of blue and red clays and marls with veins of gypsum and fossili- ferous lubbly limestones. The total thickness between Bushire and Kutal-i-Malu is from 14,000 to 15,000 ft. The series is conformable to the basal gypseous beds. The plateau beds are richly fossiliferous, and their most characteristic fossil is Alectryonia virleti (Desh.). This vast thickness of the middle part of the Ears Series passes conformably upward to the Pecten vasseli beds, which are exposed in the Persian Gulf at Kharag (or Kharij) Island, 35 miles north-west of Bushire, and along the Mekran coast almost as far east as Karachi. Their thickness is about 1,000 ft. They are richly fossiliferous, but of 120 species only one, according to Pilgrim, occurs also in the Gaj beds. Amongst charac teristic fossils are the following: Temnopleurus simplex, Dune., Clypeaster suffarcinatus, Dune., Pecten vasseli, Fuchs., Tw)7itellcL tTxcwifiQjtci, Brocchi., IVLeifYihTciTii- pora lacroixi, Aud., and a variety of the recent Indian Ocean species, Temnopleurus toreumaticus, Ag. Pilgrim regards the beds as Sarmatian (i. e. Upper Miocene beds deposited in an inland sea), and he suggests that the uppermost part may be even Pontian (the Pliocene continuation of the Sarmatian). These beds are in places but little disturbed ; but at Qishm Island they stand vertically. (8) The Pliocene: Bakhtiydri Series. — The Ears Series is followed by the Bakhtiyari Series, which is usually unfossiliferous, though Loftus found some fossils, the evidence of which is indefinite, in the (0 2728 GEOLOGY OF THE PERSIAN GULF extension of these beds to the north-west (see p. 46); They are strongly unconformable to the Fars beds, but this feature is not always distinct, as the two series have been affected by the same folds. Their age is post-Sarmatian; but since they are greatly folded they are not Pleistocene and can be safely regarded as Pliocene. The Pliocene System may be also represented by the freshwater beds of Stir to the south-east of Muscat, where a series of shelly limestones and sandstones are bent into a synclinal. They are regarded by R. D. Oldham and von Kraff as probably Pliocene. (9) The Pleistocene : Miliolitic Limestone. —Along the south-eastern coast of Arabia, on Bahrein Island, &amp;c., occur numerous areas of false-bedded dune limestone, composed largely of redeposited foraminifera and usually containing only about two per cent, of silica. According to Dr. J. W. Evans (1900, pp. 567-70) it is mainly a subaerial deposit, though some layers are marine (Evans, ibid., p. 570). Mr. F. Chapman (1900, p. 584) determined the specimens he examined from Kathiawar, western India, as subaerial, and he con cludes from the foraminifera present that the age cannot be earlier than late Pliocene (Chapman, ibid., p. 585). The deposit is doubtless of Pleistocene age. According to Pilgrim some bands in it are submarine ; but the occasional flooding of parts of the shore on which this deposit was being formed would not dis credit the subaerial origin of the bulk of it. The Pleistocene deposits along the Persian Gulf also include raised shell beds, raised coral reefs, and the coastal sand-hills. Old coral reefs occur 60 ft. above sea-level on Bahrein Island ; the Pleistocene coastal limestones extend 5 miles inland at Bushire ; and they rise 500 ft. above the sea on Qishm Island.0 IV THE GEOLOGY OF THE PERSIAN FRONT The mountain wall that forms the face of the Persian highlands is intimately associated with the geology of Mesopotamia : for the rivers which drain it are the chief tributaries to the Tigris ; its calcareous detritus contributes largely to the fertility of the Mesopotamian plains ; its geological structure gives the most direct evidence as to the cause of the Mesopotamian subsi dence ; and it contains the chief ore deposits which should find their commercial outlet through Mesopo tamia. The mountain front was called the ' Persian ladder' by Diodorus Siculus from its abruptness and the suc cession of terraces which lead step-like from the plain to the highlands. The mountains were called the Persian Apennines by Ainsworth ; but that term is unsatis factory, as the south-western marginal mountains of Persia are not a chain between two lowlands. They are the solid front of the Persian plateau; and, though the earth movements have naturally produced greater elevations on the free edge of the plateau than on its central plains, the border ranges are only the crumpled face of the great Iranian plateau. (1) The Zagros Arc. —Persia consists of three main geographical divisions : a south-western mountain arc, a central basin, and a northern mountain chain. The south-western mountain arc is a continuation of the mountains of Armenia and especially of the Taurus. It continues first southward past Lake Urmia, then south-eastward to Bandar 'Abbas, and finally eastward into and across Baluchistan. This mountain wall is30 GEOLOGY OF part of the Persian loop, which extends from the mountain knot of Armenia to the Suleiman Mountains of north-western India ; its Persian arc has been called the Zagros Mountains from the old name of their most typical constituent. ' The Zagros chain (the term being used', says Blanford, 'in the widest sense for the whole mountain range from Mount Ararat to Shiraz, together with the numerous parallel minor ranges north-east of the main chain) consists of Creta ceous (Hippuritic) and Tertiary formations, the former constituting the north-east half of the range and its slope towards the central plain of Persia, whilst the nummulitic and later formations prevail almost ex- dusiv ely on the south-west watershed overlooking the Tigris valley' (Blanford, 1876, vol. ii, p. 451). The central basin of Persia lies to the east and north east of the Zagros arc. Most of it is an area of internal drainage, which is subdivided into separate basins by the mountain chains on the surface of the plateau. These mountain chains trend from Armenia south-east ward to the opposite corner of Persia ; there they are joined by a rise of the land, which forms the western edge of the depression of Seistan and divides Persia from Afghanistan and Baluchistan. The mountains of northern Persia include the exten sion of the Qara Dagh Mountains of Armenia, the Talish Mountains which are the continuation of the Little Caucasus, the Elburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian, and their eastern continuations the Aleh Dagh and the Jagatai Dagh. (2) The Structure and Earth Movements of the Zagros Arc. Of the three geographical divisions of Persia only the Zagros arc directly concerns the geology of Meso potamia. This arc consists of a succession of folded concentric bands which form a long chain of fold- mountains. They begin to the south-west with theTHE PERSIAN FRONT 31 foot-hills, such as the Jebel Hamrin, the lowest step of the ladder of Diodorus. Each successive terrace is formed of folded rocks, amongst which older geological elements appear as the country is crossed to the north east. The folds to the south-west are fairly gentle. They become steeper and more crowded to the north east, They are due to earth movements from Persia outward toward the south-west and south. Loftus' sections show that the beds have been inverted and occasionally bent into recumbent folds (see, e .g., Mun- garreh, in fig. 5, p. 42) ; and these disturbances indi cate a movement from the Persian highlands toward Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. The same direction is indicated by Pilgrim's section (1908, p. 109, fig. 4) across the mountains at Birkeh Siflah (see fig. 12,' p. 82). The steeper side of the Zagros folds appears to be always on the outer or south-western side, as if the pressure had come from the north-east. De Morgan, however, states (1905, vol. iii, p. 59) that the rocks have been folded by pressure acting from south-west to north-east. Rut the general evidence of his published sections is in favour of the pressure having acted on the exposed rocks in the opposite direction. After the folding the rocks were fractured by numerous faults, both longitudinal and transverse. In addition to the cross faults the mountains have been in places cleft in twain by tension acting along the ridges. The facts stated by Loftus indicate that some of the deep Persian ' tangs ' have been formed as cleft- canyons (see p. 47). (3) The Rock Sequence of the Zagros. (i) The Archean. —The geological constituents of the Zagros arc range from the Archean to the Pliocene. The oldest rocks are Archean gneisses, crystalline schists, and granites. They form a band which is a continuation of the similar the rocks in Armenia. These Archean rocks form the high32 GEOLOGY OF ground to the west of Lake Urmia, and pass first south ward and then south-eastward to Senna (Sinneh). This Archean band includes the lofty peak of Alvand, and finally disappears to the south-east beneath the younger rocks about 70 miles north-east of Dizful. The schists and gneisses are associated with massifs of granite, alkali-granite, syenite, and diabase porphyrites, which are found in the Qara Dagh Mountains near Tabriz and in the mountains west of Zinjan. Granites are also extensively developed in northern and north-eastern Persia. Further outcrops of the Archean gneisses and schists occur in central Persia, as in the Anarek district to the north-east of Isfahan, and in various localities along the North Persian Chain. Loftus described a series of altered rocks which he regarded as probably altered Kainozoic beds. They include some crystalline limestones and some rocks which, according to Blanford (1876, vol. ii, p. 454), are occasionally schistose in aspect. Blanford regarded them as certainly pre-Kainozoic and suggested that they may be altered Cretaceous rocks, for he referred to their apparent passage into the Hippuritic limestones. It is possible that these semi-metamorphic rocks may be older, and even belong to the upper divisions of the Archean ; for no adequate explanation of their meta- morphism has been suggested either by Loftus or Blanford. It may be, however, that their met amorphic aspect is due to their being composed of the debris of the Archean rocks. (ii) The Lower Palaeozoic. —So far as is at present known there are no Cambrian, Ordovician, or Silurian rocks in Persia. Loftus collected in a highly crystalline limestone in the heart of the Bakhtiyari Mountains an OrthiSy which was identified as intermediate between a Devonian and a Silurian species, and may therefore, as Blanford suggested, be Devonian.THE PERSIAN FRONT 33 This supposition, however, is doubtful, since Lower Devonian rocks are unknown in Persia, as the Middle and Upper Devonian are not known to occur in the Bakhtiyari Mountains—though such a discovery is of course possible there-and as the Devonian rocks of Persia do not resemble Loftus' description of his crystal line Orthts limestone. This fossil may indicate that some Lower Palaeozoic rocks exist in the foundations of the Zagros Mountains. (iii) The Devonian. —The Devonian System is repre sented only by its middle and upper divisions. The Middle Devonian is represented in the Araxes Valley of north-western Persia by grey argillaceous limestone contammg Calceola sandalina (L.), Heliolites porosus (Croldi.), and Spirifer speciosus (Schlot.). The Middle Devonian also occurs in central Persia near Isfahan. The Upper Devonian is represented in the Araxes Valley y reddish limestones with Murch which overlie the Middle Devonian; and they extend into the Qara Dagh Mountains. The marine Devonian deposits of north-western Persia are replaced south eastward in the Kuhrud Mountains near Teheran by red sandstones of the continental or Old Red Sandstone type of the Devonian. (iv) The Carhoniferous.—The Lower Carboniferous or Dinantian Series consists in north-western Persia of limestones, which in the Araxes Valley are about 300 ft. thick. They contain Productus giganteus (Mart.) and Cyathophyllum murchisoni (Ed. and H.). Farther east in the North Persian Chain the Carboniferous limestones are well developed; and in the Zagros Chain to the south of Khurramabad, to the south-east of Kirmanshah, are some dark-coloured limestones with Pvoductus semi- rehculatus (Mart.) and P. punctatus (Mart.). These limestones were probably deposited in a gulf of the Lower Carboniferous sea which extended south-eastward GEOL. MES34 GEOLOGY OF from Armenia, since none are known in southern or central Persia. Limestones belonging to the Middle Carboniferous or Moscovian, as they contain Spirifer mosquensis (Fisch.) and Productus striatus (Fisch.), overlie the Lower Carboniferous at Manjll; in north western Persia the Moscovian limestones enter the country from the Araxes Valley, and they extend south east of Teheran as a fucoidal limestone with Spirifer ornatus. The true Upper Carboniferous or Uralian Series is apparently absent from Persia. (v) The Permian. —If the Permian System be divided into two divisions, the Artinskian, which is sometimes regarded as the lower of the three subdivisions of the Permian, being included in the Upper Carboniferous or Uralian, then two very important groups of deposits in western Persia represent the Lower Permian or Punjabian Series. The Julfa beds in the valley of the Araxes include a Productus limestone which corresponds to the Zechstein of central Europe and the upper Productus limestones of north-western India. The Julfa beds have therefore played a very important part in correlating the European and Indian Upper Palaeozoic beds. A second group of Punjabian limestones occurs at Kalian Kuh, about 70 miles south-west of Isfahan, in the Bakhtiyari Mountains. It is the oldest important fossiliferous deposit in southern Persia—the existence of a Fusulina limestone in this district w T as discovered by Rodler (1889, p. 38)—and the collections of de Morgan enabled Bouville (1904 (1), pp. 215-30) to show the affinities of this bed to the Sosio limestone of Sicily. It contains many fossils which are characteristic of the Punjabian beds of north-western India. The fossils include the trilobite Pseudophillipsia cf. elegans, Gem., of Sicily, and among the Indian species are Belterophon cf. squamatus, Waag., Spirigerella grandis, Da v., and02 (ST) THE PERSIAN FRONT 35 a Lonsdaleia similar to the Indian L. vynnei, Waag. and Wentz. That the Punjabian beds extend into central Persia is shown by the occurrence of limestones with Spiriferina cristata (Schl), Eumetria indica, Waag., &amp;c. at Suh in the Kiihrud Mountains (Douville, 1904, pp. 209-14). (vi) The Jurassic. —The Upper Permian or Thurin- gian Series and the Trias are unknown in Persia. The Mesozoic Group begins with the Jurassic ; its earliest member is the thick series of Rhaetic plant beds which occur in the Elburz Mountains, in north-eastern Persia in Meshed, in central Persia near Isfahan and Kirman, and in western Persia at Safld Rtid near Rudbar, near the south-western corner of the Caspian. The Lower Jurassic beds in northern Persia also include marine representatives of the Lias and Bajocian. They extend along the North Persian Chain, the Bajo cian beds being found at Rudbar and at Teheran. The Lower Jurassic beds also range through central Persia past Isfahan to Kirman. The Upper Jurassic is best developed in Persia along the North Persian Chain, where it is known at intervals from Armenia eastward to the Hindu Kush. It in cludes Callovian and Oxfordian beds, the latter being indicated by the presence of Perisphinctes hiplex. Three occurrences of a varied series of Jurassic rocks to the east of Lake Urmia are known from the works of Rodler (1888, pp. 207-12), Weithofer (1889), and Borne (1891); they have shown the presence of the three horizons as follows: Lower Kimeridgian, with Perisphinctes lothari, Oppel. Callovian, with Belemnites cf. calloviensis, Oppel. Upper Lias, with Harpoceras. In the Zagros arc the Jurassic beds are more doubt fully represented.36 GEOLOGY OF Loftus has recorded (1855, p. 284) between Basth and Faylun beds containing ammonites, Gryphaea, Serpula, &amp;c., and he attributed them to the Jurassic ; but as he also recorded a Voluta, Blanford (1876, vol. ii, p. 456) suggests that the rocks are younger. Loftus' generic identifications of fossils were, however, crude, and his Voluta is as likely to be a Jurassic gastropod as a Cre taceous. Stahl (1911, pi. 2) represents the Jurassic rocks as forming a broad zone 550 miles long on the inner side of the Zagros Chain and ranging from the_north-west of Senna (Sinneh), passing south-west of Alvand and Isfahan, and ending north-east of Shiraz. But he remarks (1911, p. 14) that these limestones differ litho- logically from the Jurassic rocks of northern Persia and have not yet yielded any fossil evidence as to their age. (vii) The Cretaceous.—The Lower Cretaceous is repre sented in the North Persian Chain as, for example, in the Elburz Mountains and north of Teheran where they contain Hoplites. They are also present near Lake Urmia, from the eastern side of which Weithofer (1889) has described a new Lower Cretaceous ammonite, Olcostephanus tetrameres, Weith. ; he assigns it to the Neocomian. The Lower Cretaceous may also be repre sented by the Aptian Series, since Douville (1904, p. 231) has determined the presence of this horizon in Luristan from an Acanthoceras cornueli, Orb., collected at Kuh Valamtar by de Morgan ; and Gauthier (de Morgan, vol. hi, pt. 3, Suppl. 1902, p. 186) suggests that some of the echinoids of the genera Holaster, Pseudananchys, and Hypsaster from this locality may be Aptian ; their affinities would, however, appear to be rather later. The Upper Cretaceous are far more extensive since the great expansion of the sea at the Cenomanian transgression, for which there is evidence in OmanTHE PERSIAN FRONT 37 (see p. 59), carried limestones containing Eadiolites davidsoni, Hill, into the Elburz Mountains, and Orbitulina limestones into the Anarek Mountains and south-eastward as far as Yezd. An ammonite allied to the Lower Chalk Acanthoceras rothomagense (Defr.) also occurs in the Anarek district. The Cenomanian is well developed in the Pusht-i-Kuh Range of Luristan, where it is exposed by a fold at Keblr Kiih in the foot hills of the Zagros. The age has been determined by some characteristic Cenomanian ammonites (Douville, 1904, pp. 237-43). The Hippuritic limestone, which is found beside the Persian Gulf near Shiraz, is one of the most important constituents of the axis of the Zagros, while it extends in north-eastern Persia as far as Meshed. Its age is Upper Turonian or Lower Senonian. Loftus shows it in his sections across south-western Persia ; it is well exposed on the road between Isfahan and Shushtar, where Loftus discovered in it the problematical fossil Loftuqia. The Upper Cretaceous beds of Luristan are best known from the extensive collections made by de Morgan and described by Cotteau, Gauthier, and Douville. The Cretaceous echinoid fauna of Persia is so special that of the sixty-six species collected the whole of them were described as new. Fortunately some of the mollusca have been identified with previously known species. The evidence of both echinoids and mollusca shows that the Upper Cretaceous rocks range from the Cenomanian upward to the Danian. Cotteau and Gauthier have founded fifty-five species of echi noids in de Morgan's collections from the Senonian, Maastrichtian, and Danian Series. The Cretaceous sequence in the Pusht-i-Kuh, between the Upper Karkeh and the Aft Ab, has been described by de Morgan in great detail. The following classi-38 GEOLOGY OF fication is based on his geological map of that dis trict : Miocene : an upper series of variegated marls and limestones, overlying gypsiferous beds ; the whole is regarded by de Morgan as of lacustrine origin. Eocene, the Upper or Cypraedia beds : clays and sandstones ; and underlying yellowish nummulitic limestones. Cretaceous : Banian : clays and marls with gastropods. Maastrichtian : pyritic chalk ; siliceous chalk ; marls and chalk}^ beds ; yellow limestones with echinoids ; marls and black clays with echinoids. Senonian (?) : grey limestones. Upper Cenomanian : bituminous limestones. Lower Cenomanian or Vraconian : bluish lime stones with ammonites. (viii) The Eocene. —The Eocene beds in northern Persia, in the Elburz Mountains and on the Armenian border, have a flysch-like aspect. Their most important representative in south-western Persia is the nummu litic limestone of the Middle Eocene, which forms many of the anticlinal ridges of the outer Zagros. This lime stone also occurs in central Persia near the border of Baluchistan, in the mountains south-east of Isfahan, at Suh north of Isfahan, where de Morgan collected Nummulites laevigata, Lam., var. tuberculata, Schizaster persicus, Gauth., Echinolampas grossouvrei, Gauth., Vulsella falcata, Leym., &amp;c. Farther east these Middle Eocene limestones are replaced by conglo merates and limestone-breccias. The nummulitic limestones are among the most important constituents of the Zagros Mountains, and their distribution and characters there are best known from the work of Loftus. Three of his sections (figs. 3,—Mm— MIIHUUMIM THE PERSIAN FRONT 39 4, and 5) across Luristan arc rGproducGd. to show the chief features in the structure of these mountains.

It begins on the south-west with the Bakhtiyari conglomerates and sandstones (Pliocene), which are thrown into gentle folds. These beds rest on the red sandstones and marls of the Fars Series, which may represent only the Middle Miocene, though they may contain also a representative of the virleti beds40 GEOLOGY OF THE PERSIAN FRONT (Tortonian or Upper Miocene). The bituminous and gypsiferous beds belong to the Lower Miocene. They rest unconformably upon the nummulitic limestone which is still more violently folded than the Miocene beds. At Pul-i-Zuhab a steep asymetrical anticline, with the steepest limb to the south-west, has exposed the Cretaceous limestones. Then follows the steep ascent up the great scarp, which is composed of the nummuhtic and overlying Miocene beds. From the edge of this scarp the section continues across an un dulating plateau of Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous rocks. North-east of Kirmanshah, there is an outcrop ot serpentine associated with the altered limestones, which Loftus regards as the altered nummulitic ; but they are not improbably part of the older rocks of unstan (see p. 32). To the north-west of them are slates and mica-schists, which are broken through by the granite massif of Alvand. This section well shows the plateau character of this part of Persia and the sudden descent towards Mesopotamia. Whether that descent is due to monoclinal folding or to faulting is not indicated by the section, but it was probably tormed by a combination of both. The essential features of the south-western end of this section are shown also by that (fig. 4) on a parallel line from Baghdad through the Jebel Hamrin on to the Persian plateau near Biwanj (5,300 ft.). It shows the folded foot-hills of the Bakhtiyari beds which rest unconformably on the nummulitic limestones the anticline of the Cretaceous at Zuhab, and the steep ascent on to the plateau, the edge of which at Kuh-i- Dalahu rises 700 ft. above the Biwanj plain to the north-east. Another very instructive section (fig. 5) i s that through the Mungarreh district, where Loftus' expedi tion was for some time encamped. This section trends42 GEOLOGY OF from south to north ; it crosses first the gypsiferous Lower Miocene, then an anticline of nummulitic lime stone, and then the extensive series of the nummulitic rocks beside the Mungarreh basin. On the summit of Mungarreh (alt., fide Loftus, 8,245 ft.) the nummuli tic limestone is represented as inverted and even bent into a recumbent fold due to pressure acting southward or south-westward. Still farther northward, on the Ser i Oernah iig. 5. Section through the Valley of Mungarreh and across the Bi Ab, Luristan. Length of Section, 30 miles. (After Loftus.) 1. Alluvium. 1*.

A grey compact hard sacchar-THE PERSIAN FRONT 43 oidal limestone with tabular masses of chert and a few fossils including oysters, pectens, echinoids, and gastro pods.

No. 1 (fig. 5, 3 e). A bluish-grey nummulitic lime stone with the same fossils as in No. 2. (ix) The Oligocene. —This system, though represented along the Persian Gulf at Khamir and Shushtar, is not certainly known in the central Zagros ; but farther north some conglomerates and tuffs in the Elburz are regarded as probably Oligocene. (x) The Miocene. —After the gap due to the absence of Oligocene deposits the Miocene beds, which are of great thickness, begin with an important series of oil, salt, and gypsum-bearing beds. They are known at intervals all along the outer slopes of the Zagros, from Qasr-i-Shirin to the Gulf of Oman, and are the lowest members of the Ears Series—the gypsiferous series of Loftus. Their lithological characteristics indicate their formation under some form of lagoon conditions, at the beginning of the subsidence by which the Oligocene land sank beneath a widespread Miocene sea.

Giinther, Dr. Giinther's collections came from three localities, the beach of the island of Koyun Daghi, Guverjin Qal'ah at the northern end of the lake, and Seir between six and eight miles west of it. The fossils indicate three horizons. On the evidence of the mollusca Mr. R. B. Newton (1899, vol. i, pp. 431-2) assigned to the Tortonian the beds with Alectryonia virleti; to the Helvetian the beds with Turritella archirnedis, Pecten aff. burdigalensis, Pecten suburmi- ensis; and to the Burdigalian (or perhaps older, as the fossils have Aquitanian or Upper Oligocene affini ties) the beds with Venus aglaurae, Meretrix aff. in- crassata. Ihe corals and echinoids give similar evidence • Gregory (1899, pp. 429-30) referred the coral Tham- narea polymorpha (Abich), from Koyun Daghi, to the Tortonian ; and the echinoids Glypeaster guntheri, Greg., C. martini, Desm., from Guverjin QaTah, and the coral Solenastraea turonensis (Mich.), from Seir and Koyun Daghi, to the Helvetian. The richly fossiliferous Helvetian limestones of Lake Urmia are unknown farther to the south-east in Luri- stan; but the Tortonian Series is represented by the virleh and Pecten substriatus beds at Birkeh Siflah in the Bandar 'Abbas district. The virleti beds in western Persia are of enormous thickness (see pp. 78, 80), but are not often fossiliferous. Loftus found at Husei- myeh (Hosseineah) the foot-print of a chetah-like animal and at Karind some marine mollusca, which he referred to these beds; but according to Dr. Pilgrim these fossils belong to the Pliocene Bakhtivari Series. f vP 16 lf Ptl beds both in Persia an d Armenia are ollowed by a series of salt and gypsum beds which haveTHE PERSIAN FRONT 45 yielded at Nakhcliivan two fossil fish, 1 ClupecLlanceolata, Mey., and C. humilis, Mey., and some petroleum. According to Oswald these beds belong to the Sarmatian (a series of beds at the top of the Miocene, which were laid down in a great enclosed mediterranean sea) and may be partly Pontian—the Pliocene continuation of the Sarmatian. It has, however, been generally concluded that the gypsiferous oil beds of the Persian Gulf are at a lower horizon than that to which the similar beds of Lake Urmia must be assigned. The most definite reference line is that of the Alec- try onia virleti beds ; they are generally regarded as Tortonian. The virleti beds are covered near Lake Urmia and in the Bandar 'Abbas district by oil-bearing gypsiferous beds, which in both districts are probably Upper Tortonian and were perhaps deposited simul taneously with the Sarmatian beds of the Mediterranean, though in a disconnected basin. (For discussion of this question see later, pp. 77-84.) (xi) The Pliocene. —The Pliocene marine deposits of Baluchistan, which are known as the Mekran formation, are absent from north-western Persia, where the Plio cene is represented by a series of land deposits consisting of clay and sand. These beds in Azarbaijan have yielded the remains of hipparion, rhinoceros, elephants, and antelopes ; and the presence of Orycteropus in these deposits indicates that Persia was then reached by the African fauna. These Pliocene land deposits are con tinued into the central Zagros by sandstones, marls, and limestones, about 500 ft. in thickness. Fossils are very scarce. Loftus found in a sandstone at Huseiniyeh the foot-prints of some chetah-like animal, 1 According to Smith Woodward {Gat. Foss. Fish Brit. Mus., vol. iv, 1901, p. 150) these fish both belong to one species, C. humilis, which occurs in the Lower Miocene of Wiirtemberg.46 GEOLOGY OF and in a marl in the upper part of the section at Karind some fish teeth, some bryozoa, and Murex, Natica, Cerithium, Chama, Cardium, and other shallow-water marine shells. In associated beds he found the. impres sions of plants and insects. These fossiliferous beds occur above the gypsum beds, and, owing to the resem blance of a cast of an Ostrea to a similar fossil at Mungarreh, Loftus suggested that these beds belong to the lower part of the gypsiferous series, and are near the nummulitic limestones. According to Pilgrim, how ever (1908, p. 53), these beds belong to the Bakhtiyari Series. Lake Urmia during the Pliocene was a great fresh water lake, of which the extent, according to de Morgan, is shown in fig. 6. The rivers that descended from the limestone hills to the lake deposited on its margin masses of calcareous tufa, which are, in places, several hundred feet in thickness. The easy solubility of these limestones has led to the formation in them of the extensive caves of Kereftu. (xii) The Pleistocene. —In the Pliocene and in the Pleistocene north-western Persia was a great centre of \ olcanic activity : the chief volcanoes are Savalan to the east and Sahand to the south of Tabriz ; the lofty cone of Damavand in the North Persian Chain south of the Caspian; Ararat, Nimrud, and Qarajeh were built up in Armenia by eruptions of the same volcanic peiiod. The lavas discharged from these volcanoes included liparite, trachyte, hornblende-, pyroxene-, and mica-andesites, nephelinite, and basalts. It is piobable that during the early Pleistocene there may ha\ e been glaciers upon the higher mountains of north western Persia; but Blanford (1876, vol. ii, p. 470) failed to find any definite trace of glacial action, and (1911, p. 21) has reported that even then there was no definite evidence of a former glaciation in Persia.THE PERSIAN FRONT 47 (4) The Cleft-Canyons of the Zagros. —The strain on the Zagros Mountains during the subsidence of Meso potamia may have caused the singular clefts which cut across the limestone ranges. Loftus describes them (1855, p. 282) as the most peculiar feature of the nummulitic rocks The rivers traverse the mountains through enormous clefts which are known as ' tangs According to Loftus fchese tangs are due ' to the tension ... at right angles to the axis of the chain in which they occur . It is true that he attributes the tension to cooling, whereas strain during the recent earth move ments is a more probable cause. Loftug declares ' it is quite out of the question to suppose that the rivers *&lt; themselves have been in the least degree instrumental in cutting these clefts '. His arguments for this con clusion are that the clefts frequently divide the range at its higher points; that there are no lacustrine deposits in the troughs from which the rivers flow ; and that they cut through what he calls ' the massive crystalline barriers ' and not the soft gypsiferous rocks. These cleft-canyons, or tangs, are one of the most interesting physiographic features in south-western Persia, but are still inadequately known. The con clusion that these tangs were formed as rents has also been expressed by Lord Curzon (1892, vol. i, p. 516) and A. T. Wilson (1908, pp. 164, 168). Lord Curzon says the tangs or transverse gorges are ' due, like those which I have previously described in north-eastern Khorassan, not to the erosive action of water, but to primordial fracture in the crust of the earthV THE GEOLOGY OF THE ARMENIAN BORDERLAND Armenia is the great mountain land which forms the natural, though not political, northern boundary of Mesopotamia, and gives rise to its two chief rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris. Armenia, as a whole, con sists of three chief divisions: the Taurus Mountains on the south, the central plateau, and the Pontic block to the south of the Black Sea. The Taurus consists of a great crescentic mountain block, which consists in the main of crystalline schists. These Archean rocks are burst through by intrusions of gabbro, and they are flanked on both sides by vast areas of volcanic rocks. On the northern side of the Archean block, in the down-faulted depression of Lake Van, is the lofty recent crater of Nimrud, and on the southern side the volcanic hills of Diarbekr and the lofty cone of the Qarajeh Dagh. The Taurus schists pass southward under a thick series of Cretaceous and Eocene beds, which have also been penetrated by the gabbros and aie covered in places by Miocene deposits. Farther south the Eocene rocks rise again as a gently folded sheet of nummulitic limestone ; this rock is of Middle Eocene age, and it is succeeded towards the south by Lower Eocene rocks, which contain coal and dip northward. Near JezIret-ibn-'Omar they disappear beneath the plains of Mesopotamia. The nature of the Eocene rocks on the southern border of the Taurus is apparently still best known from.roffii THE ARMENIAN BORDERLAND 49 the work of Ainsworth (1838). Ainsworth classified the rocks into three divisions: the Upper Eocene, the Dara or upper Mirab limestone containing fish teeth and abundant mollusca ; the Middle Eocene, the nummuli- tic limestone j and the Lower Eocene, red sandstone and marls with brown coals. Ainsworth gave no specific identifications of the fossils he collected, but d Archiac (1850, vol. hi, p. 194) recorded the presence of Nummulites variolarius, Orb., and Nummulites scaber, Lam., in limestone associated with massive, fine-grained sandstone in the Bohtan Valley, to the east of Diarbekr between Sairt and the Tigris. To the north of the Taurus is the great central plateau of Armenia, which is traversed by numerous mountain chains and by lines of faults and fractures which trend approximately east and west. The Euphrates rises on this central plateau and cuts its way through the Taurus, but the Tigris rises on its southern side. The north-eastern and eastern slopes of the Taurus discharge to the basins of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, which lie in areas of internal drainage. The complex central plateau of Armenia is bounded to the north by the Pontic block, which, like the Taurus, consists of a foundation of crystalline schists; it separates central Armenia from the Black Sea. The geology of Armenia is complex and varied. Its rock sequence, as described by Oswald (1906, 1907, 1912), is summarized in the following table ; Pleistocene Pliocene Miocene : Moraines.

D 2VI THE GEOLOGY OF THE ARABIAN BORDERLAND Mesopotamia is more nearly, related in geological structure to Arabia than to Persia. Both Mesopotamia and Arabia include representatives of the same geologi cal systems ; the}^ have the same great gaps in the geological record ; and in both the rocks are only slightly folded, in contrast to the complex folding of the Zagros arc. ' The geology of the peninsula of the Arabs , says Doughty (1888;, vol. ii, p. 540), 'is truly of the Arabian simplicity; a stock of plutonic rock, whereupon lie sandstones, and upon the sandrocks, limestones ; and he records further the existence of two series of igneous rocks, of which the later are lavas, while 'the old igneous rocks are grey and red granites and traps and basalts'. The apparent geological simplicity of Arabia is no doubt due in part to our ignorance ; for owing to the fanaticism of some of its natives and to its desert nature the country is geologi cally one of the least known regions of the world. The conception that the whole of Arabia is a sandy desert is, however, exaggerated. Most of the northern section between Syria and the Euphrates is apparently moderately good pastoral country. South of it lies the Great Nefud, an extensive desert of sand, which, according to Lady Blunt, is the colour of rhubarb and magnesia. The Nefud it was,' she exclaims, ' the great red desert of Central xArabia ? (Blunt, 1881, vol. i, p. 156). It extends southward nearly to Ha'il and the Aja Mountains, while a long band of red desert, the'm THE ARABIAN BORDERLAND 53 Little Nefud, lies to the south-west of the Persian Gulf. This desert widens southward to the Dahanah, which is probably an arid rocky plateau and is the least known part of Arabia. Between the Dahanah and the Nefud is the Nejd, which is apparently the most fertile district of central Arabia. Hogarth (1902, p. 72) says, 'no spot in Nejd is such utter waste that Bedawins may not camp on it at some season, and find grazing for their camels and a hidden water hole,' and Blunt (1881, vol. i, p. 157), surprised by its relative fertility, declared that this pastoral tableland explains the previously mysterious problem of Arabian horse- breeding. Doughty s view of the simple structure of Arabia is justified by existing knowledge. The whole peninsula apparently consists of one vast block of Archean rocks, which are covered in places by sheets of sandstones and volcanic rocks ; and this block is skirted by marginal marine deposits, which extend for an unknown distance inland. At least part of Arabia, however, like the peninsula of India, appears to have remained above sea-level since the earliest geological time. The Arabian Archean rocks consist of gneisses, crystalline schists, and igneous rocks, which range from granites to the dark-coloured basic intrusives, which are probably what Doughty describes as ' plu- tonic basalts '. The Archean rocks occur all along the western coast of Arabia. The Hatat Series of Oman is their easternmost outpost; and they extend from Yemen north-eastward to the Aja Range. Blunt (1881, vol. ii, p. 246) reports that it consists of granites on the southern boundary of the Great Nefud. The Archean rocks were no doubt the source of the gold, of Arabia, as has been shown by Burton (1878, 18/9), for the gold ores of Midian ; the same source is probable for the gold from Yemen, which, according54 GEOLOGY OF to Halevy (1872) and Schmidt (1913), was the most prolific of the ancient Arabian goldfields ; while Glaser (1890, vol. ii, p. 356) regards the ancient gold land of Havilah as including not only Yemen, but the land to the north and north-east of it. 1 After the Archean there is a great gap which lasts, excepting on the Arabian borders, till the Cretaceous' The only representatives of the Palaeozoic are some ( ambrian beds in the Wadi 'Arabah; a quartzite, which is probably Ordovician, found in the long railway tunnel of Bagche, which yielded a trilobite (Acaste) and Cruziana or Fraena (Freeh, 1912, vol. i, p. 1179), and some Carboniferous beds north-east of the Gulf of Iskenderun in the extreme north-west of Syria ; and in the same district there are some marine Carboni- feious, as there is also at the south-eastern corner of Arabia along the coast of Oman. The ]Si ubian sandstone is in part of Carboniferous age, and the fossils found in that formation in Sinai are Carboniferous land plants ; as they belong to the genera Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, this land area must have been connected with Europe, and the southern or Glossopteris flora had not reached it. A tract of red sandstone extends from northern Arabia far south ward, and is probably of Carboniferous age. The debris of this rock has given rise to the red deserts of the Nefud. Jurassic rocks occur in Syria, but the first exten sive marine rocks in Arabia belong to the Upper Cretaceous. Limestones of that date range from Syria south-eastward, and cherts left by their denudation are strewn so abundantly over Arabia Petrea that Doughty (1888, vol. i, p. 28) calls it the ' Flint Land '. Farther to the east, beyond the Arabian frontier in Mesopo- 1 Glaser also holds (ibid., p. 368) that the Biblical Ophir is the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf as far south-east as Ras Musandam.THE ARABIAN BORDERLAND 55 tamia, a mass of Upper Cretaceous rocks rises on both sides of the Euphrates at Anah, and is probably part of the Cretaceous mantle which once wrapped round the northern end of Arabia. These rocks extend south ward to Jauf, the oasis which lies at the junction of the Wadis Sirhan and Udian. They, according to Blanckenhorn (1914, p. 63), are two long rift valleys which have broken across the north Arabian plateau. 1 The Blunts (1881, vol. ii, p. 91) found the Arabian plateau near Mahmiyeh, 230 miles to the west-south west of Basra, strewn with flints ; and it has been suggested by Pilgrim that these flint fragments are evidence that the Lower Eocene sea extended into central Arabia, but it appears more probable that they are Cretaceous in origin. Doughty found to the west of Blunt's flint-strewn district numerous outcrops of limestone ; one, at the height of nearly 6,800 ft. to the north-west of Meda'in Salih, he described (1888, vol. i, p. 425) as ' a shelf of chalk with cockle shells ', and as ' burnt' by the lava sheets; hence the limestone is certainly older than the great plateau basalts which gave rise to the harrahs, or stony deserts. There is no direct evidence that the Eocene sea penetrated far into Arabia, though in Oman the nummulitic limestone occurs 6,000 ft. above sea-level. Its occurrence at that height was due to folding and gives no evidence that the nummulitic sea covered central Arabia. Eocene marine limestones, and Upper Cretaceous also, are, however, well developed along the southern coast. The retreat of the Cretaceous sea increased the area of Arabia, and it was uplifted into a plateau ; there is indirect evidence that southern Arabia must have been 1 But the existence of the Wadi Udian does not seem to be certainly established.56 GEOLOGY OF ARABIAN BORDERLAND part of a wide land belt. Subsequently this land was fractured by the earth movements which severed Arabia from Libya by the formation of the Red Sea section of the Great Rift Valley. These movements were accompanied by the outbursts of volcanic activity which formed the craters of Aden, of the eastern coasts and islands of the Red Sea, and probably also caused the volcanic centres in the Harrat el-'Aweiridh to the north-west of Nejd, which sketches by Doughty (1888, vol. i, opp. p. 416) represent as covered by well- preserved craters. The earth movements lasted for a long period during the Upper Kainozoic ; and some of them were quite recent.VII THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS, AND THE ORIGIN OF THE MESOPOTAMIAN SUNKLAND After the previous summaries of the geology of each of the constituents in the Arabian-Persian region it may be useful to sketch briefly the geological history of the whole. It begins in the Cambrian Period with the existence of a land which was composed entirely of the pre-fossiliferous crystalline rocks of the Archean Era. The land included all Arabia, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Armenia, and extended far beyond their limits. The sea, however, lay over the Wadi 'Arabah in north-western Arabia, the only sea-coast of that date known in Arabia and Persia. Another part of the coast of this Cambrian land crossed north-western India. This land lasted in most of the Arabian-Persian region throughout Palaeozoic times ; and the geological history of that era is concerned with the fluctuating advance and retreat of the sea upon its borders. In the Ordovician Period the sea reached the extreme north-western corner of Syria. The possibility that a gulf from Turkestan ran southward into Persia as far as the Bakhtiyari Mountains rests on Loftus' doubtful specimen of Orthis limestone. Of the succeeding Silurian Period there are no local records, the land having apparently increased in size ; but in the Middle Devonian the great extension of the sea, of which there is direct evidence in many parts of the world, led to the formation of coral limestones in Armenia and Persia.58 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF The sea occupied the same districts through the Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous, during which the sea advanced to north-western Syria, and in the ex treme opposite corner of Arabia covered the province of Oman. North-central Arabia contains extensive Car boniferous sandstones, and the land plants found in them show that the area belonged to the same botanical region as Europe. It must have been separated by the Oman Sea from the continent of Gondwanaland, which then extended from Brazil across tropical Africa to India and Australia. The sea receded once more, for there are no true Upper Carboniferous or Lower Per mian deposits in this region, but in the Middle Permian the sea had advanced again, as is shown by the Pun- jabian limestones of .Kalian Kuh in the Bakhtiyari country. As these deposits are related to those of the Araxes Valley to the north-west and to the Salt Range of India, a Mediterranean-like sea probably extended unbroken from southern Europe across southern Asia. This sea is generally known as the Tethys, a name due to Suess. Then followed another great break in the geological history, for during the Upper Permian and the Trias south-western Asia was again a continuous land. At the end of the Trias a new chapter begins. It tells of successive advances of the sea upon the land and of gieat volcanic eruptions at two distinct periods. The sea advanced from the north in Rhaetic times, but land conditions continued over northern Persia during that epoch, as coal seams are found all along the North Persian ( hain as well as in central Persia. ^ After the Rhaetic followed the Lias, during which the Urmia basin was occupied by an arm of the sea that covered the Caucasian region. Still later in the Jurassic Period extensive deposits of marine limestone were formed in northern*Persia, Armenia, and north-MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 59 western Syria. Loftus' ammonite and Gryphaea bed indicates the probability that the Jurassic beds occur in south-western Persia, though they are perhaps less extensive there than has been represented. In the Cretaceous Period happened three further transgressions of the sea on to the Arabian-Persian land. The first of these movements was in the Lower Cretaceous and possibly as early as the Neocomian Epoch ; by the Aptian the sea had spread from the Caucasian region into Armenia and north-western Persia. The most widely marked Cretaceous advance of the sea was in the Cenomanian Epoch, when a southern sea crept northward into Oman, and the Tethys spread southward over Syria and into Persia and Armenia. A continuation of this movement led to the sub mergence of most of Persia under the widespread sea which deposited the Hippuritic limestone. At the same time the sea probably extended over northern Arabia as far as Ha'il and the Aja Mountains. The sea covered Upper Mesopotamia, to the geological history of which the first direct contribution is given by th6 Upper Cretaceous limestones of Anah on the Euphrates. The difference in the contemporary faunas between the Cenomanian beds to the north and south of south western Asia indicates that a continuous land barrier then extended from Africa into central Asia. In the Arabian-Persian region the Cretaceous sea lasted longest in south-western Persia, where it is represented by the Banian limestones. The Kainozoic Group began with a volcanic period in Oman, while land conditions prevailed over most of Arabia and Persia, and the coal seams of Upper Mesopotamia were formed at this time. Meanwhile parts of the Persian Gulf were covered by a Lower Eocene sea, in which60 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF were laid down limestones and cherts like those of the Libyan Series of Egypt and Cyrenaica. The Middle Eocene was marked by another great advance of the sea and the deposition of the num- mulitic limestone ; this rock occurs in Egypt, ranges through Asia Minor, forms one of the chief constituents in the mountains of south-western Persia, and fringes the southern coast of Arabia. This limestone is known also on the flanks of the Taurus Mountains, where, as also in Upper Mesopotamia, it is succeeded by the Upper Eocene Dara beds containing fish teeth and marine shells. The Upper Eocene, however, is not very widely developed, and the succeeding Oligocene was mainly a land period and is very scantily represented. The Lower Oligocene in Armenia consists of sandstones and limestones containing marine fossils, and these were followed by volcanic eruptions and by the deposition of sandstones and lignite. The representation of the Lower Miocene is somewhat doubtful. This age (the Burdigalian) according to some authorities includes the Clypeaster and coral limestones of Lake Urmia; but the evidence seems in favour of those rocks belong ing to the Helvetian or Middle Miocene. During their formation the sea extended from Asia Minor to north 1 - western India. This Miocene transgression was fol lowed by another retreat of the sea and the deposition across western Persia, Mesopotamia, and parts of Armenia of a series of red clays interbedded with gypsum, rock-salt, and oil beds. They were probably laid down in lagoons, and as they overlie beds contain ing Alectryonia virleti their age was probably Upper Tortonian—the very end of the Miocene. The exact age of these deposits is doubtful, and it is uncertain whether the lagoon conditions existed at more than one geological horizon. Dr. Pilgrim, of the IndianMESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 61 Geological Survey, is not convinced that they were formed under lagoon conditions at all. The formation of the gypsum beds was brought to an end by an uplift which converted the whole region into a continuous land ; the sea, however, still covered the coastlands of Baluchistan and extended for some distance up the Persian Gulf. The lake and land beds of this period (the Pliocene) contain the remains of fossil mammals of African affinities. The uplift of the Pliocene land was one of the later series of earth fold ings which produced the great Alpine system of mountains that crosses southern Europe and southern Asia. The earlier movements of this series had built up mountains in northern Persia and led to preliminary folding along the line of the Zagros arc ; but the main folding that produced the mountain chains of south western Persia happened in the Pliocene. The folding was due to the thrust of the land outward from the plateau of Persia and Asia Minor ; so the direction was southward in Baluchistan, south-westward in southern Persia, and again southward in the Taurus. After the folding ceased and the force that had thrust the Persian mass south-westward was wholly spent, the reaction left the land along the outer edge of the crumpled belt comparatively unsupported ; and the collapse of this weak belt formed the sunkland of Mesopotamia. The Mesopotamian sunkland is no doubt geologically very young. ' It was', says Dr. Pilgrim (1908, p. 59), ' subsequent to this [the deposition of the Bakhtiyari beds in Pliocene times] that the tremendous earth- movements occurred which folded and faulted Creta ceous and Tertiary rocks alike, and elevated the Mio- Pliocene sea bottom to 9,000 ft. above the present sea- level. At this epoch, then, did the present mountain system of Persia originate.'62 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF The evidence as to the exact nature of the move ments which caused the depression is still inadequate. The sections by Loftus show the suddenness of the descent from the Persian plateau to the Mesopotamian plains ; and he describes the Persian border country as intensely faulted and disturbed. Its successive terraces might be explained as due to a succession of step faults; and Willcocks's map (1911, pi. 1) shows the Persian foot-hills from the north-east of Baghdad to Ahwaz as ending in a long even line, which is very suggestive of a fault. On the Arabian side a similar straight edge on Blanckenhorn's sketch-map, though it is doubtless diagrammatic, suggests that the separa tion of Mesopotamia from Arabia is along a fault or a straight sharp monoclinal fold. The termination of Mesopotamia against the Taurus is less abrupt ; the north-western angle of the great depression ends in a volcanic field, and at its north-western angle rises the lofty volcanic cone of Qarajeh ; and the volcanic activity in this district supports the tectonic origin of the Mesopotamian depression. Finally, to the south east this great valley is nearly separated from the Arabian Sea by the Musandam peninsula between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman ; and the plan of this peninsula suggests that it also is a dissected horst, bounded to west and east by faults. Folds are more conspicuous than faults on the Persian border, and the structure of its mountains may be explained as due to a great monoclinal fold crumpled by many minor folds. Such a monoclinal would, how ever, probably be accompanied by numerous faults and tectonically is essentially of the same nature as a fault. Hie Arabian frontier of Mesopotamia is less con spicuous than the Persian ; but it is apparently equally straight and abrupt. It is shown on the map bymtmessmmm ub MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 63 Blanckenhorn (1914, pi. 1) as a straight or slightly curved line, continuous with the south-western wall of the trough of the Persian Gulf. The nature of the wall between Mesopotamia and Arabia is shown by the sections prepared to^ illustrate Schweiger-Lerchen- feld's Report on Josef Cernik's Expedition to south eastern Turkey-in-Asia in 1872—3. These sections throw so much light on the boundaries of Upper Mesopotamia that five of them are reproduced as fig. 7 on p. 64. Fig. 7 a shows that the Arabian wall at El-Meshteh, about fifty miles south of Deir ez-Zor, rises from the Euphrates alluvium as a cliff of gypsi- ferous clays and marls which overlie the ' bituminous clayThe last is therefore the oil-bearing horizon of the Ears Series, and is probably Upper Miocene (%. 7 b). At Salahiyeh ruins (' Khan Kalesi ), some ten miles distant, and lower down the Euphrates, the Arabian plateau ends in a higher steeper cliff of the gypsiferous clay and marl. Still farther down-stream the sections at Hit (fig. 7 c) show that the rock sequence is the same, but the plateau has been dissected by denuda tion. The horizontality of the rocks in these sections agrees better with the faulted than the folded nature of the Arabian-Mesopotamian boundary. That the north-eastern boundary of Upper Mesopo tamia lies along a zone of faulting by which the Diarbekr basalts have been thrown down- against the Mesopo- tamian clays is also suggested by Schweiger-Lerchen- feld's section (fig. 7 d); this section shows a thick sheet of basalt on the western wall of the Tigris, opposite a series of clays on the eastern bank. The section across the Tigris, nearer to and north-west of Mosul, at Tel Fisna (fig. 7 /), suggests that the limestone on the western bank is faulted against the gypsiferous beds in the eastern bank. Further, the section north and south through the bend of the Tigris around theMESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 65 Batman Dagh, near Bebnit, between Tel Fisna and Eski Mosul (fig. 7 e), indicates from the different character of the Tigris banks to the north of that mountain, that the river is there flowing along a fault. Also at Mosul the Tigris valley is bounded by cliffs of the gypsum beds to the west and by conglomerates to the east, as if the Bakhtiyari conglomerate had there been downfaulted against the lower gypseous beds. Blanckenhorn (1914, pi. 1) represents the physical boundary of north-western Arabia as the long straight or gently curving line which marks the outer edge of the area of internal drainage. The line follows the course of the Euphrates from east of Aleppo to west of Basra ; it continues south-eastward along the edge of the plateau and separates the Little Nefud from the coastal lowlands beside the Persian Gulf ; south of the peninsula of Qatar it bends at a sharp angle, and trend ing a little north of east reaches Oman. Summary. —The most striking feature in the struc ture of Mesopotamia is the contrast between its north eastern and north-western sides. It is bounded on the Arabian side by a low plateau of relatively horizontal rocks. The Persian boundary is a high mountain zone, of which the rocks are intensely corrugated. The geological contrast is equally striking. The Arabian boundary is simple both in materials and arrangement. The Persian boundary is very varied in composition and complex in structure. The Persian front is due to a displacement of not less than 9,000 ft. in amount, which was caused by combined monoclinal folding and faulting. The step from Mesopotamia to Arabia is a slight displacement; it is probably less than a fifteenth of that on the opposite side and is due to simple faulting. Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf together occupy an asymetric sunkland that has separated the Persian highlands from the Arabian plateau. GEOL. MES.VIII THE ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS The mineral wealth of Mesopotamia and its border countries consists of various ores* of earthy minerals including salt, gypsum, phosphates, borax, and gems, and of the fuels, coal and oil; the economic geology of the area is also concerned with its soils and sub terranean water. The commercial value of the minerals lies in the future. The difficulties of transport and the unsettled condition of the country still prevent the profitable exploitation of these varied minerals except for local purposes or where they are near the Black Sea, the Caspian, or the Persian Gulf. Thus gems and salts are mined by native enterprise, coal and copper are success fully worked in northern Armenia, and the oil-fields of the Persian Gulf are being developed by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. The efforts of the Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation in 1892 to use the mineral concessions granted it by the Persian Government were premature. The information as to the extent and grade of the mineral deposits is still inadequate. Economic geology can at present only direct attention to the probable positions of the future mining fields without being able to indicate whether the mines are capable of immediate development. The distribution of the chief mineral deposits is shown on the sketch-map (fig. 8).MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BOKDERLANDS 67 P art I. T he E conomic M inerals (excluding O il) (1) The Minerals of Mesopotamia. —Mesopotamia, as would naturally be expected from its geological structure, is poor in ores. Some deposits of iron ore occur in Upper Mesopotamia, and in the Bohtan Valley on the southern slopes of the Taurus there are lodes of gold, lead, and copper. Gold has been found near Shirwan in the Bohtan Valley, and thence along a line extending westward to the western end of the Murad Valley near its junction with the Euphrates; it is associated with platinum, silver, lead, and zinc. Iron ores occur along the southern slopes of the Taurus and in the valleys of the Bohtan and the Tigris. Of the earthy minerals, gypsum and salt, Mesopotamia has abundant stores, which are used locally. Seams of brown coal occur in the Eocene Series north of Mardin, at Harbol, near JezIret-ibn-'Omar and to the east of the Tigris, and in the valley of the Bohtan River, which joins the Tigris near the salt mines of Sairt. Coal has also been worked during the war at Nasaleh near Salahiyeh (Kufri) ; the best coal obtained here in 1910 was said to be of very poor quality, but better might have been found by the further development of the seams. (2) The Minerals of Armenia.- —The ore deposits of Upper Mesopotamia represent the southern fringe of the rich and varied mineral fields of Armenia, of which the most important occur in the north-eastern and northern districts (fig. 8). Gold is found at many widely but sparsely distributed localities in northern and north-eastern Armenia. Iron ores occur in north western Persia at Avzin and other localities west of Lake Urmia. Lead is found to the west of Lake Urmia in the upper valley of the Great Zab, a tributary of the Tigris. B 268 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF Copper occurs on the Taurus at the head of the Tigris, and across the watershed in the valley of the Murad and to the west of Lake Urmia. The mineral fields of southern Armenia, however, are less promising than those between the valleys of the Kur and the Araxes ; they belong to the mineral belt that continues south-eastward into Persia, and westward into the Pontic block. The Pontic mountains contain the numerous copper mines of Ma'den and other locali ties to the south-west of Trebizond. In the same district occur ores of lead, silver, zinc, and iron, and some important coal mines. The historic copper mines of Arghana Ma'den, north-west of Diarbekr, are now closed. (3) The Minerals of Persia. —The metalliferous wealth of Persia has been famous since ancient times. It includes an unusual variety of minerals, and the recorded localities are very numerous and scattered. Owing to the widespread distribution of useful' minerals the earlier references to the mineral resources of Persia have led to many picturesque and exaggerated statements, such as the district of Qara Dagh being ' one enormous mass of the most valuable minerals, whole mountains being almost apparently composed of ores—perhaps the richest in the world^—of iron, tin, and copper , . 1 But more competent and careful later investigations have reported that the ores are often so low-grade or occur in such small quantities that they could have paid to work only with the cheapest of local labour, when the districts were protected from imported metals by insuperable difficulties of transport. Mactear, for example, concluded that many of the local mines would not pay to work with European methods under modern conditions. 1 Report by Dr. Riach to Lord Palmerston in 1837, quoted by J. Mactear (1895, p. 4).MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 69 The ores have been long worked by primitive native methods ; and their development on a modern scale was attempted in 1892 by the Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation, but owing to the unsettled condi tion of the country and the cost of transport, profitable mining by European capital was then impracticable. The mineral wealth occurs along two chief lines—an extension of the mineral fields of Armenia, along the North Persian Chain, and a mineral belt extending from north-western Persia south-eastward through the Zagros and central Persian mountains. Gold occurs in northern Persia at Kawand near Zinjan, at Damghan in the Kuh- i-Zard Mountains, west-south-west of Assarabad, and near Meshed in the north-eastern corner of Persia. Lead on this belt is known in the hills to the west of Teheran and at Semnan to the east of that city. According to some authorities the south-western mineral belt is the most important in Persia. Gold is known in it at Hamadan near Alvand, and is associated with cinnabar at Takht-i-Suleiman, and on the branch of this belt through central Persia gold is found in the Kuh-i-Benan Mountains south-west of Yezd. Lead, always containing silver, is widely distributed; it occurs in central Persia as at Anarek to the north-east of Isfahan, farther to the south-east in the districts to the north-east of Bafq, and in north-western Persia in a series of localities between the Armenian frontier and Takht-i-S uleiman. Copper is found at numerous western localities from the Qara Dagh Mountains north-east of Tabriz through a series of places extending south-eastward across central Persia past Isfahan and Anarek to the province of Kirman, where it is reported as abundant in Gaudi- Ahmer. Zinc and tin are both found in the same districts, as in the Kuh-i-Benan Mountains, and farther70 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF north-west along the same belt in the Qara Dagh Mountains. The chief occurrences of mercury, which is found both native and as cinnabar, are at Takht-i-Suleiman. Orpiment and realgar are found in the same district and in Kurdistan. Chrome iron is found in serpentine near Takht-i- Suleiman ; antimony in the Anarek district north-east of Isfahan. Iron ores are widely distributed ; among the most important are the deposits in Bafq, east of Yezd, where there is said to be a hill of high-grade ore. The valuable Persian bituminous coals are Jurassic in age ; they occur in the North Persian Chain and in the Kuh-i-Benan Mountains east-south-east of Isfahan. Rock-Salt.-—The minerals of the Zagros Mountains of the greatest present importance are those of its oil belt, where also occur the chief deposits of rock-salt and gypsum. The association of these minerals and their occurrence with beds of red clay suggest their origin by the evaporation of lagoons ; but Pilgrim rejects this explanation and regards the rock-salt as of volcanic origin. In the island of Hormuz, the Hormuz Series (Lower Eocene) contains great quantities of rock-salt which, says Pilgrim, ' presents very much the appearance of being eruptive. It is associated with haematite, iron pyrites, sulphur, dolomite, and anhy drite ' (Pilgrim, 1908, p. 16). Salt deposits also occur on Qishm Island, where they are quarried and twenty thousand tons a year exported. ' They present every imaginable colour of the spectrum in addition to the dazzling white hills of salt or jasper and the coal-black limestone.' (Pilgrim, 1908, p. 130.) The rock-salt of the Ears Series also occurs on the plain of Kamarij, one hundred miles from Bushire on the road to Shiraz. Dr. Pilgrim says that ' it occursmm MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 71 with absolute irregularity, not in regular beds, and seems to penetrate the gypsiferous and sedimentary beds as strings or veins. The mode of occurrence does not favour the idea of deposition from the bed of an ocean in the course of evaporation ; hence it can only be connected in some way with volcanic activity' (Pilgrim, 1908, p. 68) ; he regards it as due to the injection of 'a hypothetical subterranean magma containing chloride of sodium ' (ibid., p. 68). Salt is obtained by the evaporation of water from numerous salt swamps. At Maman, at the south western corner of the Caspian, the deposits contain the potash salt carnallite, and a poly sulphate of potash, magnesium, and lime known as mamanite. Borax occurs near Lake Urmia, in the Qumisheh Mountains to the south-west of Isfahan, and in the province of Kirman. Gypsum is widely distributed in the lower beds of the Ears Series. Sulphur is obtained from deposits, some of which are due to the decomposition of gypsum, and others, as in the crater of Damawand, to volcanic emanations. At Khamir and Bustaneh on the Persian Gulf sulphur is found in a decomposed rhyolite, as dusty emanations in pockets as large as a pomegrgC'nate. (4) The Minerals of Arabia. —In western Arabia gold occurs in Midian and Yemen. Burton's results from the lodes in Midian proved nothing of any present economic value ; and those of Yemen (see p. 54) are still unproved. The other known mineral in Arabia that promises ultimately to be of economic importance is the phosphate rock of eastern Syria ; it has been discovered east of the Jordan and may be traced much farther inland towards Mesopotamia. The cost of transport of this phosphate to the coast has hitherto prevented its adequate investigation.72 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF P art II. T he P ersian -M esopotamian O il -F ield The occurrence of mineral oil in Persia has been known since prehistoric times. Herodotus described how oil was collected from pits at Qirab (or Qilab), 57 miles north-west of Shush tar. Petroleum has been oozing from these springs during a period of at least 2,400 years. The first modern attempt to discover the quantity available was made in 1892, when in accordance with the mineral concession granted to the Persian Bank, boring was undertaken by the Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation at Daliki, 35 miles from Bushire. A well was sunk 124 ft. deep; it passed through sandstone and blue clay, and obtained small quantities of petroleum from some layers of semi-solid bitumen. The oil is described by Boverton Redwood (1913, p. 41) as having a flash-point of 170° F., so that all its volatile hydrocarbons have been lost. The same company bored, also unsuccessfully, at Qishm Island. Trials inland were made near Qasr-i-Shirin under the D'Arcy concession, beginning in 1901. The bitumen pits at this locality have been known from time imme morial, and their prolonged output encouraged the belief that they must discharge from an extensive subterranean supply. Wells were bored, in 1903-4, in the anticline at Chiah Surkh near Qasr-i-Shirin. One obtained oil at the depth of 800 ft. and another at 2,100 ft. The oil was determined by Redwood (1913, p. 42) as having a paraffin base and a flash-point of 75° F. In the Ahwaz district the oil oozes from yellowish marls which are rich in bitumen. Petroleum springs also occur at Mesjid-i-Suleiman, 24 miles east-south-east of Shushtar ; 40 miles south east of that town the ' White-oil Springs ' dischargeMESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 73 from a layer of sand interbedded between thick beds of blue clay and dipping at a high angle. D'Arcy's con cession obtained its best results from this district, at Maidan-i-Naftun, 50 miles north-east of Ahwaz. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was then formed to take over the area which D'Arcy's borings had proved to yield a very promising supply. In Mesopotamia oozings of oil are known from many widely scattered localities, including the springs along the Euphrates Valley between Hit and Deir. Some of the wells, as at Hit, Jibbeh, and Kirkuk, are of great antiquity. The most promising oil localities in Mesopotamia are those in the long belt extending along the foot of the Zagros arc from Mosul to the Persian Gulf. The localities that either yield oil or give indications that they may yield it may be arranged into three groups: (1) the scattered localities around the shores of the Persian Gulf ; (2) the Ahwaz district; and (3) the area extending south-eastward from Mosul to Kend-i- Shirin and Mandali. Of these three groups the localities around the Persian Gulf are the most favourably placed for commercial development; it is therefore unfortunate that they appear to be the least hopeful of yielding oil in quantities of commercial importance. The indications include springs containing gas, which is, however, not always a gas of the petroleum series ; also deposits of sulphur and gypsum, which may be derived from sources inde pendent of petroleum ; also supposed submarine oil- springs, as 10 miles north-north-east of Farsi Island ; and also asphaltic limestones, as at Koweit and Bahrein Island, in which the bitumen may be merely segregations of organic matter from the flesh of the animals whose shells formed the limestone; such bituminous occur rences in the limestones of tropical and warm temperate74 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF regions are eommon 1 afid do not imply the presence of any considerable quantities of oil. The oil-productivity of the localities beside the Persian Gulf is quite un proved, and the prospects are not particularly favourable. The second group of localities includes those around Ahwaz and Shushtar, and thence extends north-west ward to Qirab (Qilab), which was described by Herodo tus. This district incl udes the oil-field already developed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Its economic value is well established ; and until 1916 its wells produced more oil than the capacity of its pipe line and refinery, and the excess had to be burnt. The drawbacks to the development of this oil-field are the uncertain political condition of the country, and its oil being more suitable for fuel than for lighting. The third group of localities is in the foot-hills of the Persian front, extending from the country east of Baghdad north-westward to the Tigris near Mosul and Hammam 'Ali. Hofer (1906) has shown that the numerous oil springs and gypsum deposits of this area occur along three lines (see fig. 9). The longest line is the north-eastern. According to Hofer (1906, p. 823) it is over a thousand miles long and is the longest oil line in the world. Its anticlinal structure has been proved at several localities. It begins at Hammam 'AM, 20 miles south-east of Mosul, where there is a series of hot sulphur springs ; it extends through Kirkuk, which is 85 miles south-east of Mosul and 145 miles north of Baghdad ; the many oil wells at Kirkuk are situated amongst ridges of sandstone and conglomerate. 1 he northern part of this line continues past Tuz Khurmatli, where there are fourteen oil springs at a 1 De Morgan (1905, vol. iii, Part I, p. 110, fig. 94) gives a figure showing numerous such gash veins filled with bitumen in the lime stone of the Pop-e-Kazab in one of the tributary valleys of the Ab-i-Diz, above Dizful.MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 75 locality known as Neft Dagli, or the 'oil mountain'. The northern part of this line ends near Kend-i-Shirln (Qasr-i-Shlrln), where crude oil has been long obtained from shallow pits and from springs, which are shown in a photograph by de Morgan (1905, vol. hi, Part I, pi. x). D'Arcy's borings at Kend-i-Shlrin in 1903-4 opened a flowing oil well from the depth of 800 ft. and reached oil in a second boring at the depth of 2,100 ft. It has been suggested that this line is continued through Qirab and Ahwaz to Daliki and* Bandar 'Abbas. The second line begins 40 miles south of Mosul at Kaiyara on the Tigris, where it was recorded by Rich in 1836. The line extends to Salahiyeh (Kufri) and the gypsum mines of the Jebel Oniki Imam. It is 200 miles long and has five or six reported oil localities. The third line, the most south-westerly, runs from El-Hadhr, 50 miles west-south-west of Mosul, through the bituminous limestones and sulphur springs on the bank of the Tigris at the gorge of Fet-hah. It continues to Mandali about 70 miles east-north-east of Baghdad, where oil wells were described by Meissner (1874, with sketch-map and sections showing anticlinal structure, p. 345), and in 1892 thirty wells were producing oil, which was carried by camels to Baghdad. In some of the localities on these three lines the oil is discharged near well-developed anticlines, 1 so that a large subterranean accumulation may be reasonably hoped for. The oil oozes to the surface in natural springs only where the rocks are porous or traversed by joints, and at these localities extensive accumulations are less likely to have been formed than where the escape of oil is prevented by an impermeable rock cover. Hence larger supplies may occur in this oil belt at localities where there are no surface springs. 1 The occurrence of the anticlines is also shown by de Morgan (1905 (1), vol. iii, Part I, p. 66).76 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF The Mosul to Mandali belt includes the largest number of native oil wells and the most impressive surface indications of an extensive subterranean supply. Owing to its position along the valley of the Tigris and its tributaries the 'Adheim and the Diyaleh, this oil-field could be easily developed. It occurs, moreover, along the route which will doubtless be followed by the railway from Asia Minor to Baghdad. The results already obtained by D'Arcy's borings, the wide distribution of - re oil springs, and the folded nature of the country indicate this district as one of the most, if not the most promising part of the oil belt of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. (1) The Correlation of the Oil-hearing Horizons.—^ problems as to the distribution and extent of the Mesopotamian oil depend primarily on the determina tion of the oil-producing horizons. The ages of the three chief oil-bearing beds are Cretaceous, Eocene, and locene. The oldest is the Cretaceous horizon of Hormuz and Qishm Island. Dr. Pilgrim's conclusion was that the prospects here were so unfavourable that ley weie not worth testing. More recent investiga tions are said to be more encouraging. The Eocene oil localities are more numerous and important. Pilgrim (1908, p. 148) quotes five Eocene localities, viz. Om Gheir (Tel Mugheir, south of Nasiri- yeh), Eenaid el-Qar near Koweit, Hit on the Euphrates, Kirkuk in the Hamrin Hills, and Hammam 'Ali on the iigns near Nimrud. Sir Boverton Redwood (1913, p. 157) reports oil trom the Eocene or Cretaceous rocks at the following localities m the province of Ears : Yazdi Khast, Kheir, Mahalu, Easa, Darab, and Qir Pashtra. Of the reported Eocene localities some, as at Hit, are probably not correctly referred to that system ; for ne oil at Hit probably discharges from outcrops of theMESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 77 gypsum beds of the Ears Series. In other localities, as at Bahrein Island, the Eocene age of the beds is un doubted ; and the beds have been bent into domes, a structure, which, other conditions being suitable, is favourable to the accumulation of oil. It is possible, however, that the oil reported from these places comes from exudations of bituminous matter, which are often produced in small quantities from compact limestones. Dr. Pilgrim thought the bitumen had entered the Eocene limestones from younger beds ; but whether it be injected or indigenous, there is nothing yet known to disprove completely Pilgrim's conclusion that the quantity of oil is so small that, though it may be of local use, it cannot be seriously considered as adequate for an export trade. (2) The Miocene Oil Horizon. —It is generally agreed that the future of the Mesopotamian-Persian oil belt depends upon the Miocene oil beds. According to Stahl (1903, p. 623) all the Persian and Mesopotamian oil came originally from the Lower Miocene beds, though he has seen oil oozing from much older deposits, such as from the Lias near Semnan ; but he believes that this oil has soaked into the other formations from the Mio cene. Dr. Pilgrim, on the other hand, points out that in each of the three horizons the oil is associated with gypsum, salt, and sulphur ; and its association with these three minerals leads Pilgrim to maintain that they and the oil are all of volcanic origin. He therefore holds that petroleum may be found in any of the older rocks if they present suitable storage ; and that the lower Ears beds hold the main store of oil because they afford the best storage. The best-established oil-bearing horizon in this region is that of the gypsiferous beds at the base of the Ears Series. This bed is often separated from the nummuli- tic limestone of the Eocene by a strong unconformity.78 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF as is shown by Dr. Pilgrim's section (fig. 10) on both sides of Kazarun (Pilgrim, 1908, pi. 1). That a considerable interval of time separated the Eocene and the gypsum beds is shown in three localities along the Persian Gulf where the two series are separated by representatives of the Urmia Series. Thus Pilgrim's section from the Karun River 12 miles south-east of Gudar Bridge (Pul-i-Shalu) to Ser Khun, shows near the Shalil River (fig. 11) a folded and overfolded series of gypsum beds resting upon the ' Clypeaster beds, Urmia Series', which are unconformable upon the nummulitic limestone ; moreover near by in the same section, at Kuh Safid, the gypsum beds of the Fars Series lie directly upon the nummulitic limestone. The gypsum beds here appear to be those of the main oil-bearing series of the Persian oil belt. Another probable occurrence of the Urmia Series between the basal gypsum beds and the nummulitic limestone is recorded by Pilgrim (1908, p. 73) at Chinarada near Shiraz. The basal gypsiferous series of the Fars Series must therefore be younger than the Urmia Series, which Pilgrim regards as Burdigalian, i.e. Lower Miocene (1908, pp. 31, 73), and he places the Gaj Series of Sind as also of that age. These Clypeaster beds are doubtless correctly identified by Pilgrim as the Urmia Series ; hence the overlying gypsiferous beds are on the same horizon as the gypsiferous series of the Urmia district, which has been assigned to the Sarma- tian. Pilgrim (pp. 30-1) in his description of the Shalil Clypeaster bed records from it a Clypeaster allied to the C. depressus, Sow., of the Indian Gaj, a Pecten cf. rotundatus, Lam., which has also been found in the lower beds of Lake Urmia, and Operculina complanata. He concludes (1908, p. 31), 'this bed I have no hesitation in assigning to the Urmia Series '. The basal gypsum beds, however, pass up conformably through 12,000 ft.80 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF of the virleti beds (Tortonian) into the richly fossili- ferous coastal beds, which are certainly Pliocene. Pilgrim therefore concludes that the basal Pars beds are Helvetian. This view assumes that the Urmia beds are Lower Miocene (Burdigalian) ; 1 whereas the palaeontological evidence is rather in favour of their being Middle Miles Vertical and Horizontal Bakhtiyari Series. Gypsum Beds of Lower Fars Series. Clypeaster Beds, Urmia Series. Nummulitic Limestone Series. Fig. 11. Section across the Shalil River showing unconform ities between the Bakhtiyari and the overfolded gypsum beds, and between the Clypeaster beds (Helvetian) and the nummulitic limestone. (After Pilgrim.) Miocene (Helvetian), a conclusion adopted by Blancken- horn, Oswald, Newton, and Gregory. As at the impor tant Shalil section the Persian oil beds lie between the 1 Dr. Pilgrim (1908, p. 25) even includes the virleti beds of Armenia in the Burdigalian, and places them there two series lower than in Persia. This arrangement enables him to place the gypsum beds in Armenia, the Persian plateau, and South Persia, all on the same horizon ; but his assumption of two horizons for the virleti beds appears very improbable.MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 81 Urmia beds and the virleti beds, they must be either Upper Helvetian or Lower Tortonian. The basal oil-bearing beds of the Ears Series may be provisionally regarded as Lower Tortonian ; and to the same age should be referred the gypsum beds overlying the Helvetian rocks of Lake Urmia and Armenia, which Dr. Oswald has, however, assigned to the Sarmatian. He regards the Clupea specimens from the salt mines of Nakhchivan as Sarmatian, though they do not seem to yield satisfactory evidence for that correlation; the characteristic molluscan fauna of the Sarmatian has not yet been recorded from Armenia or Mesopotamia. There is as yet no adequate evidence that the great Sarmatian inland sea extended as far to the south-east as Armenia and the Persian Gulf. An apparent difficulty in the correlation of the basal oil beds of the Ears Series as Lower Tortonian is that the gypsiferous beds of the Urmia district are later than the virleti beds, instead of occurring below them, as in most of the localities along the Persian Gulf. However, at Birkeh Siflah, near Bandar 'Abbas, there is also, according to Pilgrim (1908, pp. 107-8), a series of gypsum beds above the virleti limestones (fig. 12). He records numerous layers of gypsum varying from 2 to 4 ft. thick and alternating with clays and siliceous limestones ; and these beds overlie limestones with Alectryonia virleti and Pecten substriatus. Dr. Pilgrim suggests that this virleti limestone belongs to the Urmia Series. The Birkeh Siflah section suggests that there are two gypsiferous horizons in the Ears Series—one above the virleti beds, as near Lake Urmia, and one below them, as at Daliki (Pilgrim, 1908, pp. 62-3 n.). The section (fig. 13) by Dr. Pilgrim (1908, pi. ii) shows a gypsiferous series in the upper part of the Ears Series about twelve miles from Dara Khalum, and, though the western end of this section is not very definite, its GEOL. MES. -ni82 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF evidence is important, as it suggests that the oil-bearihg beds near Ahwaz belong to the upper gypsiferous beds. The virleti beds at Birkeh Siflah are represented by Pilgrim as occurring between two outcrops of gypsi ferous beds, and they all dip in the same direction. He explains the apparent interstratification by an over- fold, and there seems no reason to doubt the correctness of this view. It involves, however, the occurrence of a gypsum series above the virleti beds, and thus it Gypsum Beds of Lower Ears Series. Tortonian. [-^-r a -t- Limestones of Urmia Series. Helvetian. Fig. 12. Section at Birkeh Siflah showing the Urmia limestones (Helvetian) outcropping in an overfold of the overlying gypsum beds of the lower part of the Ears Series. (After Pilgrim.) may be advanced to support the Sarmatian age of the upper gypsum series. Loftus (1855, p. 258) had remarked the possibility of there being two distinct gypsum series in eastern Mesopotamia ; and this explanation removes the chief difficulties. Pilgrim (1908, p. 109) is emphatic that the gypsum beds of Birkeh Siflah belong to the basal gypsum beds of the Ears Series, and this section gives no evidence of the duplication of the gypsum beds.84 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF It rather supports the interstratification of the gypsum beds with the virleti series. The section fully agrees with others along the Persian Gulf, where the gypsum beds rest on the Urmia Series ; and it supports the conclusion that the main Persian gypsiferous series is on the same horizon as that of the Urmia district and is not older than Tortonian. Suess' suggestion that the gypsum beds represent the south-eastern extension of the Schlier cannot therefore be maintained, though it has been accepted by Pilgrim (1908, p. 33) and still more recently by Blanckenhorn (1914, pp. 33, 50). The Schlier belongs to the Langhian, the special shallow-water facies of the Burdigalian (Lower Miocene) ; it must be older than Helvetian (Middle Miocene). The following correlation is suggested in the hope that it may reconcile some apparently conflicting facts : S. Persia at Birkeh Siflah (26| 0 iSF.) W. Persia Karind (34|- 0 N.) Shalll (31f 0 N.)

Clypeaster and coral lime stones. (3) Extent of the Oil Supply. —The resources of these oil-fields are still problematical. The chief considera tions in their favour are that the springs have been oozing oil for over 2,400 years ; that owing to their folded structure anticlines are numerous, and it is reasonable to hope that in many places the escaping oil has been caught and accumulated under an impermeableMESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS dome; that one valuable oil-field has, in fact, been proved since at Maidan-i-Nafttin in the Ahwaz district (the oil bed has been proved for an area of square miles, and the outflow of twelve wells in 1914 exceeded the capacity of the 6-inch oil pipe, which could carry 1,000 tons a day); and that these wells have already flowed for several years. The latest evidence, moreover, is that the yield of the wells is maintained, so that a large supply of fuel oil is assured. It may therefore be claimed that this region has already been proved to be a great oil-field. On the other hand, the arguments for a cautious estimate are that the evidence published is inadequate for any definite estimate of the quantity of oil; that the corre lation and number of the promising oil beds are un certain ; that the published opinions of such authorities as Sir Boverton Redwood (1913, vol. i, pp. 41-3, 134-5, 157) in England, of Hofer (1906, 1909, p. 486) in Germany, and of Tassart (1908, pp. 437-40) in. France, are very cautious, 1 and the conclusion of the leading authority on the geology of the Persian Gulf is dis couraging for that part of the area. Dr. Pilgrim re marks that the thickness of the oil-bearing strata is not very great; and owing to their position most of the petroleum which they may once have contained has been already wasted (1908, pp. 146-7) ; and he thinks the best chance of obtaining large quantities is by tapping the oil beds at some distance from springs, through which oil has been for so long escaping. Nevertheless, the great length of the field and the indications of oil at so many localities justify its careful investigation, and the success already attained at Maidan-i-Naftun encourages the belief that the field will become an important oil-producer. 1 Mactear also is pessimistic as to the Persian Gulf oil-fields (Mactear, 1895, p. 7).1 I ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF The occurrence of oil at such numerous localities along so great a length of country, the probability, owing to the long continued discharge from these springs, of a considerable subterranean supply, the success already achieved by the oil-field near Ahwaz, and the fact that the British Government, acting under the most competent advice, has invested heavily in this oil-field are weighty considerations in favour of the oil-producing capabilities of this region. Even if owing to the inadequate evidence and disturbed con dition of the country the present inducements may not secure the prompt exploitation of the field as a commercial enterprise, special assistance in its full investigation and development is fully justified by its political and strategic importance. P art III. T he S oils of M esopotamia The most important deposits in Mesopotamia are its soils. They all belong to the class known as trans ported soils, for their materials have been brought to their present position by wind or water. The charac teristic Mesopotamia!! soil is a light calcareous loam. It is unusually rich in lime, as it is largely made of the waste of the limestone hills in Persia and Armenia, whence the light calcareous silt is carried farther by the rivers than the heavier grains of sand. The composition of the soils may be shown by the following analyses by F. Hughes (Willcocks, 1911, p. 89) : Constituents.

Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are described by Willcocks as typical Tigris soils. No. 4 is described as a fair sample of the Euphrates soils. The similarity of the soil to the river deposits is shown by comparison of the preceding analyses with Nos. 10 and 11, of which No. 10 represents the deposit of the Euphrates at Eellujeh in January 1905, and No. 11 that of the Tigris at 'Ali el-Gharbi in December 1904. The soils of typical salt lands are shown in analysis No. 9 from near Museyib. A salt soil from Babylon contains 2-76 per cent, of total soluble salts, of which 2-46 per cent, is sodium chloride. All these soil samples were taken from the uppermost ten inches. The analyses show that the soils contain ample stores of plant foods and explain the remarkable fertility of the land when w T atered. The soils are rich in the essential constituents, nitrogen, potash, and phosphorus, while the amount of lime is unusually high for such a widespread transported soil. As the phosphoric acid is over 0-2 per cent, it is well above the average which in England is from about 0-12 to88 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF 013 per cent., and in Australia is below 01 per cent. The potash content is on an average about 0-6 per cent., which is well above the average ; for light soils usually contain from about 0 05 to 0-4 per cent. Hie salt soils contain on an average 5-82 per cent, of salts and are necessarily barren ; but owing to the porous texture of these soils they can easily be washed and the salts thus removed. Their sterility can be remedied where they can be flooded and the flood waters drained off. The use of the Mesopotamian soils will depend mainly on irrigation. The average rainfall is 8J in., of which over 8 in. falls in the winter, during, on the aveiage, 18-7 rainy days. These are distributed evenly rom November to March. The highest recorded rain fall was in February 1894, when 8 inches fell. Six inches of it fell at Baghdad in one day. The absence of summer rains renders ordinary agriculture wholly dependent on irrigation. The amount of water in the two rivers is inadequate for the irrigation of the whole of the 12J million acres in the delta of Lower Mesopotamia ; and even in ancient times the irrigation was local, the chief centres of occupation having varied in position from time to time. Some crops are grown in districts dependent upon t le winter lains by the methods of dry farming ; but an annual rainfall of 8-inches is far below the amount at which dry farming is commercially profitable under present conditions. The lands which cannot be irrigated may, along the coasts, be used for date- cultivation, and in the interior for pastoral purposes and sheep-runs.■IMllHriWJllWMMaHl^ f) MESOPOTAMIA AND ITS BORDERLANDS 89 P art IV. E conomic C lassification and F uture of M esopotamia and the S urrounding R egions According to the factors of economic geology Mesopotamia and the surrounding regions can be divided into four classes : The first class includes the lands which are of special value owing to the possession of rich soils which can be adequately watered. In this class the most important area is the delta and lower plains of the Euphrates and Tigris. It lies to the south-east of the plateau of Upper Mesopotamia, which is composed of the sandstones and conglomerates of the Bakhtiyari Series (marked by blue dots on the geological map (fig. 14). Narrow tracts of fertile alluvium, which could be easily irrigated, extend farther up the Euphrates and Tigris ; but the most extensive area suitable for irrigation is the south eastern part of the Mesopotamian valley. The chief agricultural development in this part of Asia may be expected along the lower valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris. A second class of land is characterized by a limited water-supply and by absence of mineral wealth, so it is suitable only for pastoral purposes. This class includes the plains of Upper Mesopotamia; also the north-western and northern extension of the Arabian plateau, which is mainly covered by Cretaceous lime stones, and thus after rain produces a good turf and supplies excellent grazing. It appears not at all improbable that wells, not too deep to work by wind- driven pumps, could obtain enough water for stock during the dry seasons. No definite opinion on this question can be expressed without further evidence as to the rainfall and the geological structure of the country; but if developed on the lines of the great pastoral stations of Australia the area between Palestine90 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY OF MESOPOTAMIA Map of and the Euphrates might become useful pastoral country. The Persian plateau also includes consider able tracts of country which are probably capable of development on the same lines. The third division is that of the mineralized belts of - Persia and Armenia. Metalliferous deposits are widely ^ distributed through both those countries. The ores of I 1 ' the greatest importance at present are those of northern Armenia, which includes some important copper mines. V- Owing to accessibility from the Black Sea the Armenian } -'t mines should become increasingly productive. The ^ Armenian mineral belt is continued eastward into Persia, where it appears generally regarded as sub- ' divided into two branches. The northern branch 9W,U ' foUows the North Persian Chain. The southern branch turns southward and south-eastward through I wV the mountain belt along the Persian-Mesopotamian frontier. I he sketch-map (fig. 8) would appear to indicate that the North Persian branch is the more important; but according to one authority on the mineral resources of Persia this is owing only to the moie active development of this region, and the branch along the Mesopotamian frontier is really the richer of the two. The North Persian belt lies wholly within the Russian sphere, which also includes some of the most promising localities on the south-western branch. 0 The prolongation of the latter branch through the Zagros arc into the British sphere of southern Persia includes, however, so many known metalliferous deposits that it may in the future prove to contain some very valuable mines. The fourth class of country is the oil belt of Mesopo tamia and the Persian Gulf. In this area, as previously remarked, the Ahwaz district is of most proved value, though the district from Mosul to Mandali may have the greatest future possibilities. ; i104 BIBLIOGRAPHY Pengelley, W.

The aim has been to assist the reader in their correct pronunciation without over burdening the text with a large number of diacritical marks. Thus a long accent is used to mark the length of a vowel above which it is placed (a, l, o, u), while in Turkish the modified vowels d and u are also employed ; the only other symbols are ' for the consonant 'Ain, and ' for the Hamzah, or cutting off of the breath which can precede or follow a vowel, but the latter is always omitted at the beginning or end of a word, and in such common terms as Bir (' well') and Has (' headland '). The absence of diacritical marks renders it necessary in some cases to employ the same English consonant for more than one consonantal- sound in Arabic, Persian, or Turkish, but this is inevitable in any simple system. In the transliteration of consonants it should be noted that the letter (The) is rendered as th in Arabic, as s in Persian and Turkish ; i (Dhal) and ^ (Dhad) are both rendered as dh in Arabic, as z in Persian and Turkish ; and ^ (Wau) as w in Arabic, as v or w in Persian and Turkish. The letter d (Kef) is rendered as k. and J (Qaf) as q, in all three languages. The vowel Fet-hah is rendered as a or e, and Dhammah as or o, according to pronunciation ; and the diphthong Fet-hah +Ye is also rendered, according to pronunciation, ei or ai. The Teshdid is represented by doubling the English consonant, except in the termination il_, which is rendered iyeh . The definite article is spelled as usually pronounced el ; it is always coupled by a hyphen to the following word, and the usual assimilation of the I is made before dentals, sibilants, and r and n. The feminine termination 5 is rendered, according to pronunciation, eh or ah {et or at before a vowel). In Persian final x (He) is transliterated only when pronounced ; and Izafat is transliterated by i with a hyphen before and after.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000239.0x00016e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/54</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x00016e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/54</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Geology of Mesopotamia and its Borderlands.
