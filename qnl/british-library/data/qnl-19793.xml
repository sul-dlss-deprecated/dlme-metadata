I have been graatly disappointed by your in tractable attitude in regard to the case of your brother Nasir. As I told you in my letter of 18th January your attitude is contrary to justice and » j pre judic^to your good name. It is quite true that when you called on me on the ship, at a time before I had heard the history of the case, and when you told me that Masir had jr® gone to Shasgah and I might be appealed to. I replied that t would be cautious of entering into ) the matter and I did not. But then later when your brother Nasir render- to ed signal service/Esa bin Abdul Latif and to the British55 £ 3 British Government; then with the authority of and after reference to Government, I told you that Nasir had rendered us greatly obliged, and in view of that fact requested you as an act of grace and out of compliraunt to the British Government to become , reconciled to Nasir or to give him and his mother i an aia allowance sufficient for his subsistence.

The Shaikh did not avail himself of the opening and- after some correspondence of an unsatisfactory nature, the Resident wrote to Shaikh Rashid saying that, if he waa un willing to bring the case before the Muhammadan Court or ■S to be fully reconciled to his brother, he (the Resident) would not press the matter, but it was unjust that Haairshould arbitrarily be deprived of hia rights, and that it would ba neoasaary Tor tha suaiiih to pay into the He- to sidenoy, or/the Residanoy Agent, on behalf of imair, a sura of if.10,000 as a solution of imair'a claims on the family estate, failing which representations .vould bo made to Government that he should be called upon to make / . .

No. 3378, dated Bushire, ths 9tli (received the 17tli) November 1913. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sie Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to report the following serious difEerence with Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad, Chief of Umm-el-Kawain. • • • • • • 2. I beg to call to mind in the first instance that this is the Chief who was rescued by my intervention from durance in the circumstances narrated at pages 63 and 64 of the Gulf Administration Report for 1906-07. The feeling of all the Trucial Shaikhs was exceedingly bitter against him at the time, and Shaikh Rashid was firmly persuaded that he had been delivered from death and swore never to forget the great obligation placed upon him to the British Government and its representative. 3. I would now invite a reference to the communications marginally cited, (i ) Residency lettar No. 2221, dated the 15th explaining the valuable co-operation September 1912, paragraph 3 and enclosure No. i. rendered by Shaikh Nasir, brother of the j 1 2 j t '/ Reside ^ t ' ]S '°- 413 ' Shaikh of Umm-el-Kawain, in the capture dated the 27th September (copy attached). . ' ,„ _ . n 1 - (3) Residency letter No. 2621, dated the of a large consignment _ of 875 rifles, and 17th October 1912, paragraph 2. reporting that the Residency Agent and I were agreed that the best way of rewaroing Nasir was by effecting a recon ciliation between him and his brother. Before the Arms Traffic incident occurred, I had informed Shaikh Rashid that if his suspicions of his brother made him bent upon keeping him permanently out of Umm-el-Kawain and out of his property there, it was incumbent on him to make Nasir a reasonable allowance to enable him and his mother and children to subsist, they at present being entirely without means of support, and actually in want. Shortly afterwards on the occurrence of the seizure of *No. 194, dated the 14th September 1912. arms, I addressed Shaikh Rahshid the No; Nil, dated the 8th November 1912. two further letters appended.* 4. Since then desultory negotiations have proceeded, but without result. Shaikh Sagar of Shargah on one occasion accompanied the Residency Agent on a mission to Umm-el-Kawain to assist him to talk Shaikh Rashid, round, and on another occasion Shaikh Butti bin Rashid of Dubai made a similar attempt, but with equal ill-success ; on the contrary they were treated with considerable contumely. I called at Umm-el-Kawain on my return from Maskat on 17th and 18th October, hoping that if I could get the Shaikh alone for an hour or two, I should be able to bring him round by friendly means, but unfortunately rough weather prevented communication with the shore, and after calling on two consecutive days, I was obliged to give up the attempt, as I had engagements in Bushire which could not be postponed. Anxious to give Shaikh Rashid a final chance, however, I asked the Senior Naval Officer to call there in H. M. S. ' Fox ' on his way down the Gulf a few days ago, to deliver a letter from me (Enclosure No. 4) and to endeavour to get the Shaikh to settle the case. I should mention that it had been decided by me in communication with the Residency Agent that a fair settlement of Nasir s claims would be Rs. 200 per month or Rs. 10,000 down. I attach a copy of Captain Caulfield's telegraphic report (Enclosure No. 5), from which it will be seen that the Shaikh was quite intractable. 5. I am extremely sorry to trouble Government with the case ; but in view of the Shaikh's demeanour towards the Senior Naval Officer, I do not see what room there is for further discussion, and beg that the Government of India will be pleased to authorise the coercion of the Shaikh. .C632FD2 His position in regard to his half-brother is ; that he has never given him h' proper share of his late father's estate ; that he has expelled him fi'oiu Umin '? Kawain on account of an unproved murder, of which his son is suspected • a e ,i that he will neither go before any Shara Court for the settlement of either of'th matters according to Muhammadan Law nor will he make his brother and fam? any allowance to keep them from want. ^ It would, I think, meet the case if the Government of India were to i mT) a fine of 25,000 rupees, of which such portion as they might deem fit couldf paid to Nasir and the remainder credited to Government. If that is decided I am of opinion that if one of His Majesty's ships called there with perempto ' orders to Shaikh Eashid to pay the amount within 48 hours, failing which, hi fort would be demolished, he would at once pay up ; and I trust that telegraphic orders will, if possible, be sent me to arrange accordingly with His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief who is now in the Gulf. I am forwarding him a copy of this communication. TTanslcttion of a letter No. 413, dated Rcios w l-Kliaininli {the 27th September 1912) from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to th With reference to that part of your letter No. 195, dated 14th September 1912 which related to the appreciation of His Majesty's Government of Shaikh Nasir bin Ahmad's services and his remuneration, I beg to state that as Shaikh Rashid banished his brother. Shaikh Nasir, from Umm-el-Kawain on an accusation, and confiscated all his property, claims and articles in Umm-el-Kawain, as well as his trees in Falaij in the days of his father, Shaikh Ahmad, and stopped his livelihood since his expulsion from Umm-el-Kawain up to now, it is evident that this is an act of oppression on the part of Shaikh Rashid towards his brother Shaikh Nasir. The Shaikhs of the Coast do not help the oppressed: the strong ones plunder the weak parties. My opinion is that Shaikh Nasir's remuneration is to reparate the high-handedness of his brother and this can be done in two ways:— (1) Shaikh Rashid should give Shaikh Nasir an allowance sufficient for the liv ing of himself, his family and his mother, namely, Rs. 200 per mensem and deliver to him the articles, claims, trees, etc., belonging to him. • ' ' ■ v = k ,,, vf; (2) If Shaikh Rashid does not agree to allot him an allowance, investigation should be made according to Shara Law into the matter of the estate left behind by their late father Shaikh Ahmad bin Abdullah, such as cash, furniture, etc., excepting horses, arms. Chief's house and the town. These things are exempted from distribution because they belong to the Chiefdom. Shaikh Nasir's share should be given him in accordance with the Muhammadan Shara Law. I am in correspondence with Shaikh Rashid and will report the result to you. Translation of a letter No. 194, datedt'e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad, Chief of Umm-el- Kawain. I have already written you a friendly letter regarding your father's widow and her family. Since the receipt of it, you will have heard of the excellent service rendered to Government by your brother Shaikh Nasir in courageously helping Isa bin Abdul Latif to capture a large caravan of arms. Government will be highly gratified at his conduct, and in view of his g 00 ' service to Government, it will be a graceful act on your part and a compliment to me and to Government if you use the occasion to effect a reconciliation with your brother through the medium of the Residency Agent, so that they can return 0 Umm-el-Kawain and live in comfort and in peace with you. I should regard it as an act of friendliness if you do this and hope you will not fail. May you be preserved.\ t / Translation of a letter, dated the 8th November 1912, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad, Chief of Umm-el-Kawain. I was much grieved to receive a report from Kli?.n Bahadur Abdul Latif during my meeting with him at Dubai that no arrangement has yet been made for a reconciliation between you and your brother Nasir bin Ahmad, on the line ad vised by me in my previous letter on the subject. The assistance rendered by Shaikh Nasir in the capture of arms having been approved by the high Government, it is not possible to delay the reconciliation between you and your said brother, and I call upon you, by way of advice to effect it without any further delay. In view of the favourable reports submitted by me to Government about you in the past, Your Honour enjoys a very good reputation in the estimation of Government by God's grace. I, your friend, do not desire that your good name should be changed with Government in view of this matter which exists between you and your brother, Nasir bin Ahmad, and I trust that you will accept my advice and do what is-desirable in this connection in consultation with Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif. Translation of a letter No. 374, dated the 28h in the Persian Gidf to Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad, Chief of Umm-el-Kawain. As vou are aware, when I visited XJmm-el-Kawain on 12th Zilkaadeh, the incle ment weather prevented our meeting. The object of my coming was to make a last endeavour to arrive at an amicable and satisfactory settlement with you of the question of your relations with your brother Nasir. I have always, as you will admit, been a good friend to you, but if you will not take my advice in this matter, you must not blame me for any unpleasant consequences which may result from your neglect to do so. I have no likelihood of being able to visit the Trucial Coast again for some time, and as the matter cannot be allowed to drag on any longer, I have requested the Senior Naval Officer in tL M. S. ' Fox ' to take the matter in hand for me. Therefore on receipt of this letter you will please proceed on board and take with vou or send on board the sum of 10,000 rupees in settlement of your brother's claims ; this being the amount which I consider will be fair and reasonable settle- ment of them. If you fail to comply, the Captain will telegraph to me and I shall then address Government and ask them to exact a fine from you in addition, to show their dis approval of your intractable attitude. Your friend strongly hopes, however, that vou will take this last opportunity of complying with my advice and present instructions. This what had to be explained.

These are inconvenient complications at the present stage of the case, for we do not know whether Nasir's claims against anyone except his brother the Shaikh are well founded of not. It is clear that Sir Percy Cox did not mean the lis. 10,000 of which he urged payment to Cover anything more than the claims against the Shaikh, for in a memorandum on the case which lie forwarded offi cially to the Senior Naval Officer, the words occur : 'It would be necessary for the Shaikh to pay.»'».. i...;; .a sum of lis. 10,000 as a solution^ of Nasir's claims on the family estate It follows that the scheme proposed in Sir Percy Cox's letter No. 3378 of the 9th November contains no provision for settling what may be called Nasir's second set of claims, and naturally so, for their ex istence seems to have been unknown when the letter was written^ 4. Any settlement how made With the Shaikh should be final and complete. The opening Up of a second case with him over Nasir's claims against private individuals should be guarded against. This can be done without any modifica tion of the recommendations of Sir Percy Cox if Government are willing that any claims which Nasir may be able to prove hereafter against third parties at Umm-el-Kawain should be made payable to him, up to a limit of lis. 5,000, out of the differnce between the Rs. 10,000 due to him on account of family property and the sum of Rs. 25,000 proposed to be levied from the Shaikh ; and such is the course that I venture to recommend. Even if Nasir's claims of the second category are proved in full lis. 10,000 will still remain (out of the Rs. 25,000 to be recovered) as a fine pure and simple on the Shaikh, marking the displeasure of Government at his recent contumacy. The Shaikh will no doubt collect from the real debtors at Umm-el-Kawain any sums which he is compelled to pay vicariously on their behalf. 5. Six weeks have elapsed since the truculent rejection by the Shaikh of the authoritative request made of him by the Resident through the Senior Naval Officer, and I am advised that delay in calling him to account may have a bad effect upon other Trucial Shaikhs. Translation of a letter No. 424, dated the 22nd November 1913, from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I beg to report that the ship ' Harold ' visited Shargah on the 20th November 1913, and that I called on her Captain. He asked me to furnish him with a sketch of the town of Umm-el-Kawain, its creek, the deep points in the creek and the shallows. I made out the sketch as desired by him, showing (the necessary points) both on land and in the sea. The ship then left in the direction of Umm-el-Kawain. The news received by me from Umm-el-Kawain is to the effect that the ship arrived at Umm-el-Kawain and landed two men in a jolly-boat and that they went to the town and bought certain articles of provisions such as meat, etc. The Shaikh of Umm-el-Kawain made enquiries about the men who had landed and was informed by his people that the men had been buying foodstuff. I received a report on the 22nd November that the ship had stopped on the eastern side of the town near the mouth of the Umm-el-Kawain creek opposite6 the two towers called Malah (situated) at a point called Siniyali, about on half miles on the east of Umm-el-Kawain, and that she was engaged in taF^ soundings and further that her jolly-boat had entered a deep part of the Uin Kawain creek. Translation of a letter No. 439, dated the 6th December 1913, from the Ues'H i Agent, Shargah, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. % ^ With reference to my report No. 424, dated 22nd November 1913 reprnvr the visit paid to Umm-el-Kawain by H. M. S. Harold ' for the'purposed inspecting (the position of) Umm-el-Kawain and its creek, I have the honour t state that a trepidation was thereby caused to the natives of the place and th 0 secretly requested Shaikh Saqar bin Khalid, Chief of Shargah, to interveiT between me and Shaikh Kashid bin Ahmad. Shaikh Saqar proceeded to Umm-el- Kawain and returned afterwards, intimating to me that he has received the sun of Rs. 10,000 from Shaikh Rashid and that he would pay the same to me if I furnish him with a document stating that the claims made by Shaikh Nasir bin Ahmad against Shaikh Rashid have been duly settled and that even the claims of Shaikh Nasir against the inhabitants of Umm-el-Kawain, which had been contracted in connection with business transactions while he remained at Umm- el-Kawain, have been dropped. I consulted Shaikh Nasir as regards dropping the last named claims. He replied that he would forego the claims he has against Shaikh Rashid on account of the past transactions, the inheritance, and the date-grove he has at Falai, in consideration of the Rs. 10,000 but that he will not drop his claims against the natives of Umm-el-Kawain, which amount to Rs. 5,000 ; and that it is not desir able for Shaikh Rashid to cause him to forego his claims against others. I am of the opinion that Shaikh Rashid will surely recover Shaikh Nasir's claim against the natives of Umm-el-Kawain in future ; and that if the claims of Shaikh Nasir against the natives of Umm-el-Kawain are foregone, the case will cost Shaikh Rashid only Rs. 5,000. It rests with Your Honour now to decide and I will act upon such orders as you may give. f t G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C. 632 F. D 31-1-14 7 —E.A. (Telegram. « Prom Foreign Delhi. To Resident, Bushire.

No. 899, dated Bushire, the 28th March (received 6th April) \ From— Major S. G. KNOX, C.I.E, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreio-n and Political Department, Simla, 0 In continuation of correspondence ending with your telegram No. D. S .-136 dated 5th March 1914, on the subject of bombardment of' Umm-al-Qauvain, I have the honour to report that I embarked on board H. M. S. ' Fox ' on the evening of the 15th March and reached Farur Island on the morning of the 17th March, where we met H. M. S. 'Odin,' who, according to arrangements pre viously concerted, transferred to us Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, Residency Agent, Sharjah ; and, after H. M. S. ' Fox' had taken over her mails, we proceeded to Umm-al-Qaiwain, arriving there on the morning of the i8ih March. 2. The morning was misty and it was not until noon of the rSth that I was able to despatch the Residency Agent to the shore bearing a letter from myself to Shaikh Rasid bin Ahmad. This letter was of the nature of an ultimatum and a translation is enclosed and forms Appendix A to this report. The Residency Agent returned about 4 p.m. and reported that, at first, the Shaikh showed no inclination to open the letter but the Residency Agent insisted and finally read the letter to the Shaikh. He then asked if the Shaikh, proposed to send a reply by him but the Shaikh said that that could wait and that it did not matter. The Residency Agent then said that he had my instructions to say that I was willing to see the Shaikh or an important member of his family on board H. M. S. 'Fox,' but the Shaikh refused either to go himse ! f or send a deputy, saying that he was afraid. Finally, the Residency Agent stated that the Resident had business in Lingah and did not propose to wait at Umm-al-Qaiwain until the expiry of the period named in the ultimatum but that H M. S. ' Odin ' would lie off Umm- al-Qaiwain all I hursday and that, if the Shaikh thought better of his attitude, he could pay the money demanded to her Commander. In all this, the Resi dency Agent simply carried out the instructions given to him verbally by myself before he left the si.ip. As soon as he re-embarked, H. M. S. ' Fox' steamed away to Lingah, where the next day, Thursday, the iprh March, was spent in ordinary inspection duty and consulting His Majesty's Vice-Consul. Lingah, about the affairs of that town. ' s 3 I have omitted to mention that Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif, still in accordance with his instructions, conveyed a warning to Brit'sh subjects, two Bunniahs, of the danger in which the town stood, and directed them to convey themselves and their families and belongings to the neighbouring village of mmariyah. 4. H. M. S. ' Fox' again reached Umm-al-Qaiwain shortly after daybreak on Fnday morning and was met there by His Majesty's Ships ' Dartmouth ' and Odin.' The Commander of the latter delivered to me a letter, which had been sent to my address on board H. M. S. ' Odin ' the day before. A translation cf this letter accompanies this report and is marked Appendix B. Its terms were not considered satisfactory, and I informed the Senior Naval Officer of 'ts con- ents and that it was now for him to take charge of the situation. 5- * ne objective selected for the first bombardment was a large tower stand- HJS P^G^ically on the beach and some little distance from the rest of the town, us tower was roughly 90 feet high and surmounted by a flagstaff, on which o^ever no flag was flying. The usual red flag was seen flying from the Shaikh's jf si e ^ c 6 and, round the base of the tower, were clustered a few date huts and, 0 ugh many people could be seen trekking off in the direction of Hamariyah, or any people still remained going backwards and forwards from these same huts. It was understood that the tower was empty which, however, from a er r ®P 0r ts, proved not to be the case but, in order that the people might be ^arned, an attempt was made by the Captain of H. M. S. ' Fox' to get into nication, through the ship's interpreter, with some of the fishing smacks C|FDwhich were lying fairly close to the ship. As soon however as the boat came ' their direction they all sheered off and it was only found possible to speak to o boat, whose two occupants immediately took to the water. The interpreter 6 however, was able to talk to them, when they replied that they knew all about' the bombardment and so did the people. This took place about 9-30 a m. 6. Nothing further transpired until noon, the time fixed for the bombard ment to begin. It was some moments before the Senior Naval Officer, with a feeling which I entirely shared, was able to bring himself to hoist the signal for the bombardment to begin, when women and children, donkeys and goats could be seen moving hither and thither among the date huts already mentioned.' Any weakness, however, would have been fatally misunderstood and fire was opened on the tower. 13 shells in a'l were fired and half the tower was blown down when the red flag on the Shaikh's residence was hauled down and a black flag hoisted in token of submission, at 10 minutes past noon. 7. Shortly afterwards men were seen coming to the beach bearing another black flag. A boat was sent ofl to fetch them and they proved to be 'Abdur Rahman bin Saif the Shaikh of Hamariyah and Abdur Rahman bin Ahmad brother of Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad. By this time the Arabs were ready to do anything, so long as 1 took the ships away, but they could not resist a certain amount of haggling. I informed them that I had my orders which were their orders and those were that Rs. 25,000 were to be produced on board H. M. S 'Fox' by 4 p m. or the bombardment would have to begin again' and I added that up till now, we had merely been frightening them, that^at 4 p.m. the objective would be the Shaikh's residence, which would be demolished' when we shou'd p'oceed to work havoc among the pearl boats which could be easily seen from the quarter deck of H. M. S. 'Fox.' 8. We got rid of these Shaikhs as soon as possible and in an hour they had returned with Rs. 22,000, all in new Rs. 1 ,000 Government of India notes and another brief haggle ensued. This time it was suggested by them that Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Saif should be security for the remaining Rs, 3,000 but a word that I did not catch from Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif sent 'Abdur Rahman bin Ahmad back to the shore and he produced the remaining 3 notes which, with one hiatus, formed a perfect series of numbers. This makes it clear that Shaikh Rashid had been bluffing all the time, for the whole of the money was paid long before 4 p.m. in spite of the three journeys from shore to ship in the steam cutter of H. M. S. 'Fox' and the haggling. A formal receipt signed by myself was then granted to the Hamariyah Shaikh for the money, and the two Shaikhs were dismissed. They begged for a letter of pardon, stating that all was forgiven and forgotten, but I replied that such a letter would be forthcoming rom me, when the Shaikh thought fit to write for one through the Residency Agent. Translation of this receipt forms Appendix C to this report, t?' ^off that evening for Ras-al-Khaimah where t le Residency Agent informed me that Shaikh Nasir bin Ahmad was living but it was found impossible to pick up the place in the dark and the Shaikh was not rought on board until the morning. 1 he sum of Rs. 10,000 was paid to him and at the same time a letter of which a translation is attached as Appendix D, signe by myself, was given to him. This letter explained the circumstances in which and reasons why the money was paid to him. At the foot was written an acknowledgment, which Shaikh Nasir signed, stating that he had no further ai , rn . s a I ^ a j n f st , brother. He demurred somewhat to signing this, stating at he had further claims in regard to landed property and buildings, which were not inherited but acquisitions during his own life time. He was told that e could put up any further claims he liked through the Residency Agent for w &lt; f r . a '' Ion no promise could be given him beyond consideration, in this reserve he signed the acknowledgment already alluded to. A sum ? 1 S ' ^' 0 3 00 WaS handed over the Residency Agent, who also signed an ac now e gment setting forth the conditions under which the money was repon translation of this document forms Appendix E to this 10 ' ^ on, y mains for me to pay my tribute to the careful and excellent arrangements made by Captain ( Caulfeild, R.N., Senior Naval Officer in the3 Persian Gulf, for imposing the will of Government on this recalcitrant Shaikh The overwhelming display of force, the accuracy of the firing which in a crowded town caused the dc'atn of only nine peisons, mostly it is stated, buried beneath the debris of the fal.en toner, the almost instantaneous shock of the punishment meted out as 1 have said elsewhere the whole affair was over in less than ten minutes -combine to convey a lesson that the Trucial Coast will not soon forget Khan Bahadur 'Abdul L.atif, Residency Agent, proved useful and his forecast of events and their results intelligent and accurate. ii.

The Shaikh of 'nibal had come to Sharqah at nigh-time to hold a consultation as regards assisting the Shaikh of Urpm-ul-faiwain,but the latter sent a messenger on the same night to both the f, Shaikhs f stating that the men-of-war fired at TJ^m-ul- ^aiwain and that he paid the amount demanded from him. and further that there was no need of their assistance as the men-of-war have left. - It has been ascertained by me,from, reports,that 1 on Hamad bin Ibrahim's return from Sharqah to U^m-ul Qaiwain,the Shaikhs of Sharqah and 'Hibai recommended to him to tell the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain that the action taken by thel men-of-war was serious and could not be overlooked,and that he should write an 'Jstlsh- had'(Testimony) in connection with the incident send the same to them so that they may seal it that he should send it to the G-over&gt;nment of Indial.

He declared that a rumour was current at. Umm-ul-Qai- wain that the Shaikh of that place contemplated to revoke all his previous treaties with tM. British Go vernment and to conclude agreements with other Europ ean Powers such as Prance and Cermanv. I remarked her^ as far as I could judge during previous meetings to be with the Shaikh,he seemed/so ignorant that he could not be suspected of knowing either Prance or Germany: but this gentleman explained that he is 'instructed' in this matter bv some members of his tribe who claim to be caquainted with freign politics,and that it has even been suggested to him. that he should send one of his brothers to Baghdad with a petition to the Porte,soliciting that assistance may be rendered to them by Turkey. He(the informant) was inclined to think that Shaikh Psahed would this last action. Perhaps these are only the usual'talks' which are always current in those places,but I thought it advidable to report his remarks for information.
