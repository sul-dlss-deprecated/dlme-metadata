The Shaikh claims to have clear proof of this in the shape of woodcutters who saw and spoke with him. From the many and clever questions apparently asked, the woodcutters gave it their opinion that ibnMuharib, was trying to gain information about, wiiat Nejd tribesmen were in Kuwait, and the day and hour of their expected departure.

Question of Col.Biscoe meeting I 'bn Saud. Copy of C.O. letter to ^Ipdia. Previous Papers 29a 2000 5.31 FOR INFORMATION. ■ Last August there were three small incursions of Ihn Saud’s officials into Koweit: they attacked and interrogated several Koweit subjects. Two of these t incidents vtere reported at the time and Mr.Hope Gill was instructed to take an opportunity of protesting to Ibn Saud, when he had received further detailed information about them, from Colonel Biseoe. This information has now been sent, and at the same time a further incident is reported. This time Ibn Saud^ frontier officer himself crossed into Koweit territory on October 29th and stayed there four days spying out the land with a small party and questioning the inhabitants. TheThe significance of this case, which has disturbed the Colonial Office, is that Colonel Dickson is of opinion that the incidents are merely a prelude to more vigorous blockade measures this winter* He (and the Sheikh) feels that if prompt protest were made to Ibn Saud, the King would realise that we are on the alert and would restrain his officials. If not, serious trouble might follow. The question of delivering protests to Ibn Saud on this kind of subject is now settled direct between Colonel Biscoe and Mr.Hope Gill, and the latter may already have taken action: in any case Ibn Saud ! s trade agent at Koweit has written His Majesty a letter (at the Sheikh’s dictation) reporting the incidents. But this state of tension makes it more than ever desirable - as the Colonial Office point out - that Colonel Biscoe should have his much-delayed meeting with Ibn Saud as soon as possible, with a view to preparing the \my for a settlement of Koweit-Hejd questions generally* Sir A. Ryan has telegraphed to Colonel Biscoe that Ibn Saud left Riyadh for Hasa on January 2nd,“and it may be that the Resident will be able this time to arrange a meeting. With reference to paragraph 2 of the Colonial Office letter to Foreign Office now submitted, the Foreign Office have telephoned to say that they are not proposing to take any action as they presume that Colonel Biscoe will take any steps that may be possible or desirable.

Colonel Biscoe in a letter to me of 28th October presumed that the next move would come irom Jedda. He is still occupied with the Arab air route and moreover has no means of transport of his own. Moreover if he is able to go to Hasa he would certainly have preferred to have some assistance from Jedda in sounding Ibn Saud, and may feel diffident about talcing the initiative without a telegram from here.

He points out that any one reading this would assume that what he intended was that the depth of the sea was not sufficient for the purpose of a port but what he actually said was that there war? not sufficient drinkingwater on shore. Actually at Has Tanura a ©hip can get reasonably close in, I believe, but attempts to dig wells for drinking purposes have so far met with very little success, The matter le not of great import anca, but if it could be done without inconvenience it would perhaps be ju t as well to remove the ambiguity by inserting the word * drinking* before 'water* in the Record, Yours, &amp;cu, (SB) r.v.Blscoe. 1 i :.Y,Flood, Isq, Colonial Office, pcndon.B 12b' Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted b-Tr-'kfol.

There remains the question of the actual name© of the officials of H*M* King Ibn Baud, who were concerned In the J incursion© in question. These were as follows:- (i) in case (a) and ( 0 ) the names of the raiders were as follows:- Leader * Far a} ibn ifuhilan al sab* an. remainder of J-arty&gt; Abdul Aziz bin Duhiman H&amp;fflud bin wms&amp;m MUtluq al Hlrshanl Sa*ad bin Hadnan Samakh al Kahtani. (U) in case &lt;b) H*E* the Shaikh tells me that the mm were clearly recogniaed as being a *war ,f party (Sariya)(3ariy&amp;) from Nejd from %h&amp; styl© of the trappings on the dromedaries (rikaib), and from the out of their (imn*s) ciothing, and their mode of speech, out as each man 1 s face was oiosely hidden by his headcloth (kaffiya) #iich was wound romud hia head exposing only the eyes, it was not actually possible for the Kuwait party to identify them. in the shaikh’s opinion however, and this view is shared by myself, the man were actually the same as were concerned in raid® (a) and (c) mentioned above. 6 . Lastly the names of all the persons given in the previous paragraph are known to form part of Bin Baud’s blockading force under the orders of Abdttr Rahman bin nuli&amp;rlb (ibn arfaj’s successor) who has his headquarters permanently at jarriya &lt;150 miles south of Kuwait.

These were on (a) 10 th August 1951, (b) 12th August 1931* &lt;c) 19 th August 1931 f and were probably all committed by the same party.

(c) was stupidly not reported earlier to the Political Agent on the excuse that the authorities in Kuwait were collecting evidence. The main facts in case (c) are as follows:-. on 19 th august 193i* a merchant one Salih bin WaX ,domiciled in Kuwait who had been to N*Jd for tho purpose of getting married, was returning home. At 3haiba, on the coast, he was set upon by 6 men who .aid they ware servants of Abdur Rahman a! 'Jutmlrlb, Bin 3aud's official at Jarriya.

Sir, Reference my confidential ££®«X$$ dated 4tli November 1951 and. paragraph III of tame, also in continuation of my confidential ffo #136 dated 5th November 1931 both of which should reach you by the ease mall as tills letter; I have the honour to report that on the 4 th November X received a visit of His iSxoellenoy the Holer of Kuwait who somewhat excitedly end with considerable indignation complained to me that /.bdur Rahn&amp;n ibn Huharifo, Bin Baud’s frontier officer at Jarriya, had followed up the activities In Ax^ust of his Lieutenant farraj ibn MUhllan al Subhan, by himself secretly crossing into Kuwait territory on the 29 th October, adopting tho role of a military recommisance patrol and remaining there till the evening of the 2nd November. 2. Hi® Excellency said that the man was accompanied' by an escort of 3 arised camel riders, and quit®quit© obviously took pains to kmp his mrmmtn as secrat as possible, ooming to water only twice and then to the out of the way wells of Kabd and C^adgdlyeh 2 l J&gt; and 15 miles from Kuwait territory respectively, t&amp;urtng th© whole five days he rsmalnsd lurking among tli© heavy sand hills which lie In coneiderable numbers to the south f$»st of ICuwait. 3. The Shaikh further stated that he first had news of ibn Muharib«s presence from some wood cutters (on 1 st November) who reported that they had been held up* on the 2 previous days ( 30 th and 3 Xst) at the point of the rifle by a band of 4 *»en #10 had suddenly emerged (on both occasions) from the sand dun© country some mil©® to the ss&amp;st of Kabd wells. After having been interrogated they, the wood-cutters, were let go. The questioning took th© form of a regular inquisition a® to what ^w&amp;zim and Kutair or other tribal caravans were in Kuwait, who th© leaders were, I what they were buying and when they were likely to leave. The wood—cutter® did not recognize tiie pa.rty the first day, but on th© second on© of them recognised ibn imharib himself* 4 . The shaikh said that on hearing the news he at one a sant out an armed party in 2 oars to Kabd wslls which there met several Bedouins watering their flooka who reported having seen# recognised, and talked with Abdur Rahman al-., 2 uharib and party, who they said had shortly before eoue to water. 5 . The oar patrol having reported the above factsfacts, the Shaikh again sent them out (on 2nd November) to Chadadiyoh wails mm 15 miles from Kuwait. Her® thej founa more Bedouin who reported that ibn lluharlb and party had watered that morning* The Bedouin knew and recognised the leader and members of the party. 6 * Sand ihn Nimran in charge of the shaikh*s car patrol immediately returned to Kuwait and asked permission to pursue and capture ihn imhabib and his men as their camel footprints were olearly visible and could be followed up. The shaikh forbad this, lest, as he said, a fight take place and further complications arise. 7 . The Shaikh did however send out a couple of scout© on camels to follow and got into touch if possible. Those mn later cam® back with the news S that ibn liuharlb had spoken with them and had given out that ho was looking for 2 escaped slaves froei the camp of the Out air at naffar who had taken shelter in Kuwait. Tills according to the Shaikh was obviously © blind for the ©laves were known to be in Kuwait, which they had reached 10 days before* 8 . The Shaikh ended by r#&lt;ga..ting »e to report \ the above facts to you and particularly asked that urgent representations be made to H»S.Klnfa .in ^-ud j both with regard to the previous c'-ses of aggressions | in August, it this had not been done already, and the | present spying activities of ibn !,!«harib. •mis if J you approve, I suggest might be done telegraphically. 9. “ The shaikh1 9 * Th# Shellkh protested that he was always willing to sea and welcome any flajd official who cared t© openly visit Kuwait, or who had any complaint to make against any of his subjects, but that the Incursions of August on the part of ibn guharib*s lieutenant and paid men, followed by the present hole and corner spying of Ibn Siuh&amp;rlfe himself could not be tolerated, and if not sharply checked would in his opinion only result in bolder action on the part of Ibn gaud’s unscrupulous representative, with the inevitable regrettable result® (raids and bloodshed)* 1 q. X apologise for having submitted such a lengthy report on an incident which may perhaps appear not of very great importance to one not residing in Kuwait, but X have done so of m% purpose, as I feeliev the present activities of ibn Muharib ere merely the prelude to more vigorous blockade measures which are to come into operation this winder, the period when everyone begins to think of raids etc*, in Arabia* I feel with the Shaikh that if we draw Bin Baud»a attention at once to what hie lieutenants are doing, he, Bin Baud, ill realise that we are wide awake and are not to be caught napping* m will then counter- mank&amp;ny orders contemplated or given, which may show him up In bod light with R*M.

It is probable however that his present financial straits and the influence in consequence exercised over him by his bankers, the ^uassibis, would prevent his modifying this policy. In ini 3 event tii0 only coarse to adopt wo’old seem to be to hint at retaliation, e.g. tlie raising of the Bahrain transit dues. There may other means of bringing pressure which may suggest themselves to ills Majesty's Minister. (iv) Itm 3 aud has mentioned three matters which he on his side wishes to discuss with me.

It will be remembered that the efforts made to bring about a meeting between Ibn Saud Previous Papers .*— - 4475b 1000 5.30 and the Political Resident have come to nothing. Sir Andrew Ryan in reporting an earlier stage of the discussion on this point indicated that he would in due course 'review, probably by Despatch^ the position as seen by me in regard to possible Persian Gulf negotiations.' (jedda telegram - : Q . 12 23rd January on P.Z. 511/31). Colonel hiscoe has taken the opportunity to put forward his own views on this subject for consideration in connection with those of the Minister at/ C_' C. i 26 DOM 'Wi VIm \ f K [ Y at Jedda when expressed. The Resident’s conclusions are summed up in para. 15 of his Despatch. He strongly urges the importance of an early solution of the Koweit. Blockade hut thinks Ihn Saud’s present financial straits and the influence in consequence exercised over him Tby the Qusaihi family (to v/hose interested hostility he continues to ascribe much of the responsibility for the present situation) may prevent the r-##^9¥F34^Fi&lt;3H*fcy which might otherv/ise be expected w r ere an appeal to be made to his better nature. In that event he would £as in the past!suggest a hint of retaliation such as would be involved in the raising of the Bahrein Transit Dues. As Regards the- King’s Persian Gulf Desiderata, ' the'Resictent suggests that they may prove less difficult to deal with than have been anticipated. Except that the Koweit situation has become more acute, the situation is substantially the same as it was when the future policy on this question was considered last Jul^ (see notion P.4945/30 flagged). There is, however, nothing to be done but to wait a more favourable opportunity of approaching Ibn Saud.If and when ■■ e decide to do so, it may perhaps be possible to make a careful use of the threat of retaliation, it is satisfactory in the meantime to see that the Resident anticipates that it may be possible without great difficulty to make Ibn Saud see reason about his m the Persian Gulfcnfore particularly on the ■f fin 11T«f f.” , ' p | i- i; C^giQiiuiications on this subject loiiul be addressed to— he Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l. nd the following lumber quot ed: 89060/31 bir, t * y | ^1A DIRECT /f b Downing Street, jl r\~? * 1 LO-t i 1 »c Ai 11 ■ * ..... r -■' i ebruary , 193\. -&gt; t lv With reference to the letter from this Office of the 10th of February I am directed by Lord Passfield to transmit to you for the information of Mr. Secretary Benn a copy of a despatch from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding possible Persian Gulf negotiations and to state that the whole question of future negotiations with Ion Baud will no doubt be considered on the receipt Oj. the despatch foreshadowed in Bir Andrew ityan T s telegram No. 12 of the 23rd of January.

' Sf f *' .P .Z .1234 /31 ; 2 zl) p onfidertt ial No.3. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the 31st January 1931. My Lord, , 1 have the honour to invite a reference to Hr &gt;C Andrew telegram Ho.12 of the 33rd January 1931 to Hie Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in whleh ho said that he intended to review the position, ae seen by him, in regard to the Persian Gulf negotiations. 2. As lb n Saud has nov left Hejd, there is no likelihood of a meeting between him and myself taking place in the near future and I would therefore also venture to put my views regarding the Persian Gull negotiations before His Majesty’s Government; they may perhaps be of interest to His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah, Md assist him in any discussions that may take place with King Ibn Saud. 3. During the Akhwan rebellion His Majesty’s Government informed the Shaikh of Kuwait that if he acted in accordance with their wishes as regards the cutting off of supplies to the rebels, etc., they would, when peace was restored, endeavour to bring about si cessation of the blockade which had been imposed for some 9 years by Ibn Saud on Kuwait. 4. The Shaikh of Kuwait did act in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government; some supplies did reach/ at .Hon’bit Lord Passfield, P.C., „ , , His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London. -- 2 - reach the rebels, but they were certainly very limited in amount ana 1 believe that a considerable proportion oame from Basrah and other ports, 2 have frecjuently endeavoured to obtain accurate information as to what actually did bring about the final collapse of the Mutair and Ajman. fhey had arms and they had men, and no encounter on a large scale took place between them and Xbn Baud’s forces. All my information is to the efleet that their final collapse was almost entirely due to the fact that they had run out of surriles of every kind, both of food and of ammunition, and that they knew that they could look for no support either from His Majesty’s Government or the Shaikh of Kuwait, They could obtain no shelter in ’Iraq or Kuwait and had therefore been obliged to march considerable distances, and were at the end of their resources. This state of affairs was brought about very largely by the measures enforced by the Shaikh of Kuwait acting on the advice of His Majesty’s Government, which he loyally followed, despite his own strong personal inolina* tions. I believe that His Majesty’s Government recognise that this is so, and have every desire to implement their undertakings to the Shaikh to bring about a cessation of the blockade an a restoration of the former prosperity o * Kuwalt. 5 # j discussed a few days a o with the Shaikh the effect of this blockade on his territory, and asked him what the estimated loss caused to him by it had been, shaikh Sir Ahmad told me that before the blockade the revenues of Kuwait amounted to between seven and eight lakhs of rupees, c.uwait is the largest Arab town in Mesopotamia or Arabia after Baghdad - a fact which possibly may not be realised. the Shaikh told me that despite the fact that taxation was exceedingly/exceedingly light* 4 per cent, on imports and 2 per cent, on exports, before the blockade Kuwait was one of the most prosperous cities in Arabia, and the State paid all its expenses comfortably, and generally had a balance to devote towards improvements, etc* Nowadays, the revenue was below two lakhs an* despite the most stringent economy, the State had last year been unable to balance its budget, and the deficit had been made good bj contributions from the private estates of the ruling family. 6. I asked the Shaikh to what he actually attributed the blockade, and he said '’entirely to the influence of the Quasaibi family”. I do not think this statement is wholly correct, though I think it is very largely so. 1 believe Ibn Baud, in the past at any rate, was actuated partly by personal ambition to round off hi® territories by reducing Kuwait to the status of a feudatory. On the other hand, I do not think there is the least doubt but that the blockade was originally imposed owing to the Influence of the i^pasaibl and that nowadays it is maintained owing to them. 7. The Qp&amp;s&amp;ibls, as His Majesty’s Government are aware, are Ibn Baud’s bankers. They are of humble origin and entirely self-made men, and, 1 believe, in former years were twice made bankrupt. Subsequently, however, they got in tjuch with merchants on the Hasa coast, Hoffuf, etc., ans gradually straassed a considerable lortune by lucky deals in pearls and other m«E~ne , and ultimately started financing Ibn Saud. Sbr some years they formed the Hasa customs and then prevailed on Ibn Saud to divert trade viith f ejd lK1 Kuwait to Bahrain. Ujair and Hoffuf. supported in this by the influence of the Hasa merchants. They are sai to receive a salary of Hs.SOOo a month from Ibn Saud and to make/** V make enormous profits on goods ordered by him from India. It is currently reported that they are owed seven to eight lakhs by Ibn Baud at the present time, and I think there is no doubt that they wield much influence with the King, 8. To turn now to Ibn Baud’s desiderata. He ha© stated - vide Mr. Bond*© despatch Bo♦180, dated the 19th June 1929, to His ^ajesty*s Secretary of :tate for Foreign Affairs • that there are three questions which he wishes to raise in connection with the Persian Gulf; (1) Qua toms and transit dues collected in Bahrain on goods imported into 1 ejd; (2) certain points relating to the nationality and passports of Heja&amp;*»Bejd subjects in the Persian Gulf; (3) the position of Ibn S&amp;ud ’a agents in Bahrain and Kuwait. As regards (2) and (3), I see no particular difficulty in discussing these matters with Ibn Baud. - do not Know what he wishes to discuss regarding passports, etc., Ymt the matter will probably be capable of settlement without much difficulty. As regards the status of his agents at Bahrain and Kuwait, I think if it were pointed out to him that the grant of consular status to his agents in Bahrain and Kuwait would inevitably lead to similar requests from Persia and 'Iraq, he would not press the natter. oreover there is no doubt that the Syrian entourage of Ibn Saud are not on good terms with the ^asaibio; Abdur Rahman ^uasaibi told me this himself in Bahrain and probably they would not welcome any increase in the quaeaibi prestige in Bahrain, and therefore their influence would be utilised against the proposal• 9./ 4'' iff9* n.ori‘t impor nn*!* ion Ho^qvqu? i® tHsiti oi* Bahrain transit dues. &amp;s regards them, I think it might be pointed out to Ibn Baud that these dues are very definitely levied for services rendered. The Bahrein Government have provided at Bahrein, wharves, warehouses, lighting, a crane, and in fact all the facilities that are provided in a civilised port, so far as their finances permit. They are even now contemplating an extension of the pier, which will cost a large sum of money, and will enable lighters t © come alongside at all states of the tide. Further, the transit of goods - and Ibn Baud’s imports are frequently on a very large scale - involves clerical labour, and the provision of guards, watchmen, etc. 10# The Hedjas Government benefit by all these facilities and It is not much to ask that in return they should pay the very modest rate of 2 per cent customs duty, and the request that these transit dues should be waived is in the circumstances wholly unreasonable. 11. If Ibn Satid chooses to tranship his goods on the high seas, then obviously he can avoid payment, but so long as he utilises the facilities provided by the Bahrain Government, he has no reasonable ground for pi*otes?t ix he is asked to pay something towards their oost. It la nQ t a tax levied by the Bahrain Government on his goods, but a charge made for definite services rendered. 12. I do not think therefore that there should be any particular difficulty in discussing the demands of Xbn Baud in connection with the Persian Gulf• on v ^ strong ground i&amp; maintaining the present position, xha questio arises as to whether any pressure can be brought to bear on him to relax the Kuwait Blockade. Possibly, Ibn Bat d riay havehave abandoned hia p raonal aiabition to include Kuwait in hia territories; he has many other preoceumtionsi and hia attitude towards Kuwait ha a been markedly more friendly of late; some Beduoin have been allotted to purchase goods in Kuwait, though the caravan traffic is still entirely prohibited* 13. There is still, however, left the influence of the ^uasaibis, which will certainly be exerted for the maintenance of the blockade* If 1 was discussing matter with Ite Baud I should, in the first instance, make an appeal to his better nature* Ibn Said knows perfectly well that he owes practically everything to Kuwait. Kuwait gave him and his family shelter when they were refuge s. It waw with the help of the Kuwait tribes and the support of Shaikh Hubarak, that he set out on the conquest of Arabia, which has led him ultimately to his present high position. Bo ihiimate were the relations between Ku^mit and Ibn &gt;at*d that, when Ibn Baud was quarrelling with the Turks, he used to send to Shaikh Kubarak letters received from the Turkish authorities, and Shaikh Ifubarak used to write the replies and seal them with Ibn laud’s own seal, which was in his possesion, for Bhaik Uubarak had the reputation of being a skilled and forcible writer. Ibn Baid is undoubtedly impulsive, and is capable occasionally of a 'grand geate^* It is pOBSible though perhaps not probable - that if an appeal was made to him on behalf of Kuwait, pointing out the ruin that his present policy was bringing on this e all principality, to which he owed so much and how unworthy hi 3 attitude was, having regard to all the citcumatanoes of the case, he might respond. I believe that he woul i if he e entirely free in the .natter. He is however, apparently aliaoat atat the end of hie finanoi*! resourcaa* He already a consider able mm t» his hankers, the tjuasaihia, and xaay HaTe need of farther assietanoe from theia and they fire doubtless capable to bringing much preesure to bear on him. If than, this method of approach fails, there would seem nothing for it but to adopt a sterner line and to hint to Ibn daud the possibility of retaliation. 14* Xbn Baud clearly realises that it is in our power to retaliate. hien 1 met him last year, he said to me n am not friendly with the British be cause 1 particularly lo^e the-o, but because X rea?w!se that they have got me by the throat*. The best retaliation that I can thirds of would be the raising of the Bahrain transit dues tc 5 per cent. w« ireposed a reduction of the dues on the Shaikh of Bahrain forcibly and against his wishes. They are a constant grievance to the Shaikh, and moreover the Bahrain State is at present passing through a period of acute financial stringency. 1 doubt whether it would be necessary to pu the threat into execution. The intimation would, o.i course, have to be tactfully conveyed, but I believe, that if I bn laud saw that His mjesty*s Government intended to get their way in this matter, he would yield, and this vie-/ a imy mention is shared by Colonel Biekaon who knows Xbn laud intimately. The ces mtion of the blockade woula certainly pleaaa th. m^ohanta of Hajd; it might ho supported hy uad Hamza aa a blow to the ‘iuasaibia and poeaihly Hafiz ?ahha he a ome oountarpoiae to the (iuaaaihi influence which -al^t induce Ihn Saud to :i«rea to a restoration of the would usd his influenos on the same side. fharo would therefore previous caravan traffic between hejd and Kuwait, and a restorationrestoration of tha pro^p^rlty of thin city. 15 . To sum up; (l) the hloo. ! 'C%&lt;la is s!®t?ly ruining Kuwait fit the present time. (11) It is therefore rmnt important that His Majesty’s GoY&gt;rnraent should implement their undertaking to the JJhaikh to try and bring about a cessation of the blockade with as little delay as possible. (iii) I would iryself in the first instance ?aake an appeal to Xbn Baud’s better nature, pointing out all he owes to Kuwait and the harm that hi 3 present policy is causing. It is probable howewer that his present I financial straits and the Influence in consequence exercised orer him by hit- bankers, the ^uasaibis, would present his modifying this policy. Xn this erent the only course to adopt would seem to be to hint at retaliation, e.g. the raising of the Bahrain transit dues. There way be other means of bringing proeeure which insiy suggest tbsra&amp;elwesto lie Majesty’s Minister. (ir) Xbn Baud has mentioned three matters which he on his wide wishes to dlsouaa with me. I do not think there is any need to avoid a. discussion of these questions, ae om of them is probably capable of frierm,*/ settlementN VJtTH.

Hejaa Minister did not tell me before I left London what, if anything, had passed between him and the King. I cannot enquire here in view of his hostility to Fuad and inaccessibility of Ibn Saud him self. It might be worth v/hile to ask Minister inform ally how the King reacted to report which he promised to send you but I do not think it specially important to do so. I think best course will be for me to writs personal letter to Fuad referring to his personal letter to me of October 7 th since when there have been no developments at this end’ to say that Biscoe is anxious to pay his respects to the King during his visit to Nejd; and to ask whether it would be convenient to His Majesty to receive him at Riadh or any place between there and Persian Gulf, I should emphasize courtesy character of proposed visit letting Fuad understand that proposal arises out of his own suggestion to me that I snould take some further action to placate Ibn oa.d. I see no objection to Die ns on accompanying biscoc and would propose to mention in my letter to Filed probability2 probability of his doing so* I would suggest not enlarging party further except of course by addition of necessary servants etc.. It is desirable to avoid any appearance of a delegation. In rry opinion extent to which business can be discussed must depend entirely on Ibn Baud’s attitude if and when visit actually takes place.- He will almost certainly touch on pending questions himself but I see no prospect of his settling any of them.. Best hope is that if King agrees to proposal visit will restore completely friendly personal relations and enable us to judge better how to approach stage of formal negotiations on Persian Gulf questions. Biscoe may find it possible to agree on list of matters to be discussed which I think will have to include not only those relative to Koweit but also Bahrein questions especially in view of recent exchange of somewhat acrimonious letters between Ibn Sand and Sneikh oi Bahrein. I am preparing letter to Fuad but should like to be assured of your approval before sending it. -uu should go as soon as possible as King is unlikely to spend more than three to four weeks in Bejd.

To Under Secretary Secretary of State... Committee H. E J A 7,- Question of _negotiations between Colonel Biscoe and Ibn Saud. &lt; Under Secretary Secretary of State... Copy ol FOR INFORMATION. Please see previous submission on P. 7748/30 below. The Government of India’s telegram of 14th November has crossed hr. Walton’s letter to hr. Howell of 7th November, forwarding a note of the recent informal discussions on this subject between Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Andrew Ryan which, if the Sheikh plays up and Ibn Saud responds, may materially alter the situation. The Resident is probably right in thinking that negotiation with a o„elegation would be unlikely to produce results of value. We had referred to this danger in our telegram of 17th October to the Government of India* The objection to oho alternative course he suggests is that it gives Ibn Saud a/a pretext for deferring discussion of any sort with the Resident, on the ground of the (possibility of making uhe necessary arrangements during his present- stay m Neja, until an indefinite date in the future. Ana, as His Majesty’s Government have decided (after consideration 0 f the contrary view expressed by the Government of India) that we must without further delay endeavour to implement our promises of over a year ago to the Sheikh of Eoweit, this would probably mean that negotiations would be conducted at Jeddah by the Minister, with the assistance of a Persian Gulf expert. The Foreign Office would welcome this, but it would mean the elimination of the Resident from the discussions, and for that reason we have hitherto (successfully) opposed it. For the moment I suggest that we need do nothing until W e see the result of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba’s approach to Ibn Baud. If the King in reply expresses his willingness to meet the Resident at Riyadh or elsewhere in Hasa, it will be the easier to take a rapid decision now that the Government-of India are in principle prepared to contemplate such a meeting, and that their views and those of Colonel Biscoe as to the composition of the delegation are on record. Copy of the Government of India’s telegram has been sent to the Foreign Office, and will be seen by Sir Andrew Ryan before his departure for Jeddah on Thursday. The papers are for the moment submitted for information only; rlinute Peipsi* pS Si f S to s fill rfy K&gt;vu T-cc seof re ob f 3ou Department. Since the above minute was written, Sir Andrew Ryan has had an opportunity of considering the proposals in the Government of India’s telegram. His views are given in Mr. Warner’s demi-official letter of 22nd November on P. 8241/30 below, which speaks for itself. (Incidentally, paragraph 4 of the letter is incorrect. What I said to Mr. Warner was that the Government of India’s suggestion that the liquidation of Koweit questions could be allowed to wait had been considered and rejected by the interested Departments in the summer of this year. Nothing had happened since which seemed to justify a reversal of this decision, though there.was admittedly no point in pressing for a discussion of Koweiti affairs until friendly relations had been re-established between the Resident and the King. Mr. Warner, in sending a copy of his letter to the Colonial Office, proposes to explain this.) The Minister’s suggestion that the first essential is finally to liquidate the Bahrein incident seems &lt;£&amp;£££$ sound, ana we nusu, I tnin^, be guided by him as to the effect which would be produced on Ibn Baud by a proposal to associate the Sheikh of Koweit and Colonel Dickson with a courtesy visit for this purpose, and to make it an opportunity for a full- | 1 w 0 47'J3a 5000 10 30 dress discussion of the points in issue oetween Koweit and Nejcl. It seems clear that the only tning ^o ao for the moment is to await the result of Hafizwahba’s suggestion. If Ibn Baud is unwilling or -unable to arrange for a meeting with the Resident in the course of his present tour in Nejd, the matter will have to be considered/ 1 &gt;considered afresh in consultation wion Six A* Ryan, ^ho will by'then have returned to Jeddah. Time is short, and it is always possible that we may have to take a rapid decision in the event of Ibn Baud deciding to invite the Resident to meet him duri his forthcoming visit to Nejd. In these circumstances, will perhaps be well to telegraph to the Government of India and Bushire on the lines of the draft attached, d (X&lt;- ^ - /ai fe^XLHccc ^ ' ng it'•N Jr &amp;JL Dfer bh 0 -f x '^ ^J&gt;^s he more corraet to say that cannot accept the Laithwaita aproas v;ith my aeooimt of our conclusion 3 • I also enclose a cony of a letter from hand#! to Laltawaita of the 3rd tiovomber with its which I think is self-explanatory* $^af J L. lJ(ULAjJiJFOBEIGU OFFICE, S.W.l. 22nd November, 1930. Dear laithwaite, You asked me to let you have the gist of ■iks..;. Byan* s views on/Government of India telegram to the India Office about the proposed discussion of koweit and Persian Gulf questions between Ibn Saud and Colonel Biscoe, copies of which were enclosed in your official letter P7965/30 of the 15th November. V Byan* s chief point is as follows: the sug gestion that Colonel Biscoe should, if possible, pay a visit to Ibn Saud, while the latter is on his pro posed visit to Nejd next month was made with the idea of finally closing the unfccfeunate 'Biscoe incident'. If it were suggested to Ibn Saud that he should meet not only Biscoe, but also the Sheikh of Eoweit and Dixon, Byan is afraid that Ibn Saud would think we were trying to rush him into meeting Biscoe, would resent this and probably refuse; we should then have failed not only to get a discussion of Koweit questions, but also to close the 'indident'. Byan thinks therefore that ... Laithwaite, BSq. ethat it is important that^if Bisooe goes to see Ibn Saud while the latter is in Hejd he should go alone and * 4 primarily on a courteijyp vrsit # There would of course be no objection to Biscoe^ breaching the Koweit questions with Ibn Saud, more or less informally, if he considered the atmosphere favourable. 3 , Ryan 1 s only other comment is that the time factor may prove a little difficult. According to the latest information. Ryan has had from Hafiz wahba, Ibn Saud T s intention is to go into Nejd early in December, make a tour in that part of his dominions and reach Medina by about the middle of January. (Ibn Saud has, it appears, promised the people of Medina to spend Ramadan there, and we reckon that that would involve his reaching Medina in the middle of January.) ^ I understood from you the other day that the India Office were most unlikely to accept the Government of India's view that the discussion with Ibn Saud o~ iWfMr Kowelt questions could be allowed to wait, if necessary for quite a long time, in the hope that Ibn Saud would himself propose negotiations on the 'Persian Gulf questions -S. S \M, 0 . &gt; ,’’questions”. We are, I think, agreed that in these circum stances - and having regard to the fact that neither Biscoe nor the Government of India had received the account of what passed at Ryan’s dinner to Hafiz Wahba when they expressed the views contained in the Government of India telegram referred to above - we should wait a short time and see if the letter which Hafiz Wahba promised to write to Ibn Baud produces an invitation from the latter for Biscoe to pay him a visit, and also to see whether the Government of India have different views to express when they receive the account of the dinner party. Incidentally this will give time for Ryan to reach Jedda, where he could, if necessary, take further soundings as to the atmosphere. We also, I think, agree generally that Ryan’s view is sound, that we should aim first at disposing finally of the 'Biscoe incident' by means of a courtesy visit by Biscoe to Ibn Baud, while the latter is in Nejd this winter, and that as Biscoe and the Government of India/India are both against negotiating on the Koweit questions with a Hejazi delegation, the question of how to bring about such negotiations with Ibn Saud himself must perforce be left for later considerationlf I UL- GU( pi/nr (173 groups) 7237 COP Y JO IE G R A M, From CISCHJLA2BD) Government of India* Foreign and Political Department, to secretary or State for India, ,1’ 1 Jaued Bew Bellii. 14th Novomb6r 5 1930 , Received 6oX5 pomo^ 14th Bovemher^ 1930o X Z X 57^4^So FIRST OF TWO PARTSo Addressed to Secretary of State for India* and a-^r mail to Political Resident in the Persian ^ Gulfo Your telegram of the 18th ultimo* 3330o' Bejd-Xoweit questionso 2o Following from Resident TolI9* November Vtho &lt;1 j ^gin so Your telegram of the 23rd ultimo* 3h32^So I do not thinh there is any probability that negotiations with delegates would have any useful (? result) o Ibn Saud* who is obviously trying to evade Koweit issue* would certainly not authorise them to make concessions on the question of policy of this nature* and 2 if negotiations were abortive* as is probable* it would b© more difficult to re-open the matter on a subsequent occasion© Unless Ryan (? sees any objection)* X suggest that Ifrn Baud might b© informed that* in consonance with kno^n policy of His Majesty 1 s Government of encouraging friendly relations between neighbouring Arab rulers* it is proposed that the Sheikh °f Koweit and Dickson should (• n accompany ) me for discussion of Koweit questions* other matters being discussed with me direct,* 'Ihat in these circumstances negotiations cannot be conducted *ith |T fv( delegates/ &amp; 15 NOV 1930 i&lt;1 delegates whom Sheikh as an independent ruler would not be prepared to meeto That ’while In normal circumstances Q&amp;air or some place on the coast would have been suitable T enue , in view of the shortness of His Majesty* s stay in ITejd* Hie Majesty 5 s GQYernment {? will) authorise me to proceed inland to Hoffuf Riadh. or arpy similar place selected by the F-ingo Ends 0V r} j !Mf a, vas/kn (115 groups) COPY PI 1 TELEGRAM.

Please see previous submission on P. 7208/30 below. We have not yet had the Government of India’s reply to our telegram consulting them on j that paper; but in the meantime the situation has been modified in an important respect as the result of a meeting between Sheikh Hafizwahba and Sir Andrew Ryan, in the course of which a discussion took place as to the best method of finally liquidating the Bahrein incident. A note of the discussion is enclosed in Mr. Rendel’s letter of 3rd November below. There is also enclosed # in the letter the tosv of- ibn Dueid 1 ! promised further^letter explaining the nature of the^incident and the cause of hrs resentment against the Resident'. The papers speak for themselves. The'principal new fact of importance which emerges from the correspondence is that the Commander of the ’’Patrick Stewart”, with ^ '-'S, a curious lack of imagination, communicated the Resident’s telegram of instructions verbatim to Ibn Saud. Having regard to the naturally concise and abrupt character of the instructions in question, xu is not surprising that His Majesty took offence. rests with Ibn Saud. But it will, I suggest, oe well interests of expediting a decision should Ion Saua react favourably to Hafizwahba’s promised letter and suggest a meeting with the Resident on the Hasa coas o, or even at Riyadh.

It would re establish personal relations between the King and the Resident; it would give an opportunity to Colonel Biscoe to re.ise the question of Koweit; and there would be nuch more hope of some substantial result than is likely to be: the case if we are reduced to negotiation between the Resident and a Hejazi delegation.

Last evening I had Hafiz Wahba to dinner. Suddenly, about 11 p.m., he expressed a quite spontaneous wish to talk about the Biscoe affair. The conversation began between Mr.Bond, the Minister and me but you and Mr. Laithwaite heard the greater part of it. I told the Minister that the incident had been moreor less satisfactorily disposed of but said X feared that some feeling remained in the King's mind. Hafiz Wahba once more explained the reasons for the King's resentment. I reiterated the arguments I had used to the King himself, stressing particularly the fact that all the communications had passed through a simple sea-captain. There was nothing new in all this. What did emerge from the conversation was a suggestion that, if a favourable opportunity offered, Colonel Biscoe might wait upon Ibn Baud. I guardedly agreed that this would be a good thing, you and Mr .Laithwaite concurring so far as youyou could do in a conversation sprung on us unexpectedly at a private gathering. I ruled out an alternative suggestion made out hy Hafiz Wahba that Colonel Bisco^ should ?/rite to Ibn Baud, not by way of apology but by way of explanation, for I am quite sure that the drafting of a letter which would reajiy improve matters would present unsumountable difficulty. I also ruled out any idea of Colonel Biscoe coming as far as the Eejaz. I expressed the view that advantage might be taken of the King’s expected visit to Nejd for Colonel Biscoe to visit him at some convenient place. The upshot of the conversation was that Hafiz Wahba expressed complete readiness to lend a hand and promised to send a letter on the subject to Ibn Baud. (Signed) Andrew Ryan.

It was not laid down in the programme of H.M. to call at Bahrein on his return from the meeting of Lobin. It was first decided that he will oome down at ?,ae n aimur&amp;, but owing to a change of the climate, a violent tempest at sea, strong wind blowing and rough waves, the Captain of the Patrick Stewart was obliged to submit to H.M. that it is difficult and risky to stop at Has Tannura and to go in launches from there. The Captain himself informed H.M. on Sunday evening 25th iiamadan (24.2.1930) that it is also dangerous to stop at the outer harbour of Bahrein and that it is necessary to anchor in the inner harbour of Bahrein, H.M. having learnt this and owing to the relations and connexions between Al-Saud and Al-Khalifa and owing to the strong relations between H.M. the King personally and Sheikh Aisa, which are like the relations of a son with his father, he did not think it Arabic loyalty to pass by that Sheikh and not to see hi®. H.H. the King never thought that the British Government object the confirmation of connexions between the Arab Amirs at the time when they endeavoured to make con nexions between H.M. and the King of Iraq. So he telegraphed in the evening to Sheikh isa and requested to visit him at al- lianama. H.M. informed Sheikh Hamad and the C&amp;pt&amp;in of the ship of his intention. It was only two hours from the time H.M. informed the Captain of the ship till the receipt of the follow ing telegram in reply from Col. Biscoe by the Captain of the ship. 'Immediate Commander Patrick Stewart Bushire Haaio. Please explain to King that in view of the fact that Sheikh of Bahrein has had no notice of intended visit and will probably not be in Manama I would suggest that visit should/should not he paid on this occasion but that King should proceed direct in launch to Qjair* Addressed Patrick Stewart repeated Bahrein* n Resident# The Captain came and showed the telegram to H.M* It is 5 as you will see from its tone and form, containing something not right and void from any courtesy at such time* So H.M. decided to refuse calling at Bahrein and changed his first intention* In the morning when the ship anchored at Bahrein harbour. Sheikh Hamad and the big people of Al-Khalifa and the big people of Bahrein came on board and informed H*M# the King that Sheikh ‘isa who is like his father is waiting for him at a 1-Manama, and that the people of Bahrein are quite ready to receive H.M. The Amirs and the people of Bahrein persisted too much in the demand from HJ* that his character obligee him to grant their request. So H.M. the King disembarked and saw Sheikh Aisa. He then left Bahrein in the launch for Ujair ?(Uqair). H.M’s. visit to Bahrein was not an official one and was not such as to make it necessary to have arrangements ana steps taken before hand. It is also not required in such case that official ceremonies for reception should be made, as is the case in the Kings' visits which they make in the official capacity.s Copy 16/9 6 / 91 ) Mr. Rendel ;- The above is the portion of Fuad Bey Hamza’s personal letter to me of October 7 bearing on the Biscoe incident together with the statement referred to in it, which statement was foreshadowed in the King’s reply to my letter on the subject. I dislike the ’’high-pardoning” note which is again struck. What disconcerts me more, however, is (a) Fuad’s last sentence hinting at the desirability of pursuing the matter further and (b) the use made in the statement of the actual text of Colonel Biscoe’s message to the Captain of the Patrick Stewart, otherwise the statement contains nothing new and it is absurd of Ibn Saud to pretend that my letter from Dijon was based on imperfect information.

Department. rs Please see the Departmental minute oi 1st July, flagged D, giving the history of Ibn Baud’s request for a discussion of Persian Gulf questions with His Majesty’s Government. It will be remembered that an unfortunate misunderstanding arose consequent on Colonel Biscoe’ s action in endeavouring to prevent the King from visiting Bahrein on his return from the 'Lupin' conference, as a result of which His Majesty indicated that he rep on e d. o conduct negotiations^with the Political Resident. The explanations subsequently furnished by the Resident and the Government of India were communicated to His Majesty by Blr Andrew Ryan in a private letter (copy under 'foreign Office letter of 10th September on P. 6126/30). The gist of Ibn S&amp;ud's reply to this letter is given in Jeddah telegram No. 178 oi 1st Cctobm, on P. 6826. The reply is, broadly speaking, ^un satisfactory. The King withdraws his objection (though rather grudgingly) to negotiating with the Resident, and is prepared either to negotiate with him at Jeddah or to send a delegation to in negotiate with hm/the Persian Gulf. The King’s reply iHRite disingenuous In suggesting that there are no questions of importance for discussing j f relating to Koweit, more particularly in view of the fact that special emphasis was laid on the • desirability of a Koweit settlement in Sir Andre'' Ryan’s private letter. The/ N e 449U 5000 5 30 UThe question of the action to he taken in the light of Ihn Baud’s reply was discussed informally with Sir Andrew %an at the Foreign Office on 3rd October. As a result, a draft telegram consulting the Government of India was prepared. The Foreign Office and Colonial Office both concur in it in its present form (for Sir Andrew Ryan’s conments on the original draft reference may be made to his letter of 3rd October, flagged E) . The draft, I think, speaks for itself, it may, however, be remarked^that there are obvioi.s difficulties in sending the Resident to Jeddah to negotiate. His position vis -a- vis the Minister would not be easy, and if negotiations failed, we should, have no second line to fall back on, such as there ¥? ill he if negotiations in the Gulf are not successful. Secondly, it seems suite clean that we must be prepared to face discussion of Ibn Baud’s Persian Gulf desiderata, . This is a pity, for they may well prove embarrassing, but it seems; inevitable in present circumstances. Sir Andrew Ryan is understood to be returning to Jeddah before very long, and it is desirable, if possible, to ascertain the Government 01 Indla ' s visws (they may wish to consult the | ^ice-iit), c-iio discuss them with him before he goes. An early decision is, in these circumstances, desirable. u♦ * J&amp;&gt; r Uvl )ij II. IA OFFIC mrmi l.

Bushire despatch No. 30 of June 30th to Colonial Office, of which copy has been sent to you direct. His Majesty’s Government attach importance to early negotiation of general settlement between Nejd and Koweit, with particular reference to customs questions. Favourable opportunity is afforded by fact that Sheikh of Koweit has now put forward definite proposals for conclusion of agreement on lines of Bahra Agreement. These proposals have not yet been considered in detail and may need revision, but principle of agreement has already been accepted by Ibn Baud (see his letter of January 27th to Colonel Biscoe in Bushire despatch No. 3 of January 31st to Colonial Office). In view of nature of questions for discussion, His Majesty’s Government still think it desirable that negotiations should if possible be conducted by Political Resident in Persian Gulf. From your telegram No. 59 (of May 20th) it appears that Ibn Baud’s objection to negotiations with Colonel Biscoe arises from the Bahrein incident. His Majesty’s Government hope that this objection may be overcome by Colonel Biscoe’s explanation given in his telegram No. 673 of 4th July enclosed in my despatch No. 247 of July 21st2. on receipt of which you should approach Ibn Saud on following lines. His Majesty’s Government are now in a position to discuss proposed agreement between Nejd and Koweit and are anxious to take the opportunity also to discuss Koweit customs embargo, regarding which representations have already been made to His Majesty. They trust that for this purpose he will be prepared to agree to a meeting with the Political Resident in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. If Ibn Saud replies that he is unable to receive Colonel Biscoe for personal reasons, you should enquire the nature of difficulty and, if it is in fact that suggested, offer explanation now submitted by Resident. If King’s objection is of a different character and it proves impossible to remove it with the information at your disposal, you should state that you must rexer home for instructions. I appreciate that it may be impossible to dis sociate this negotiation from consideration of Ibn gaud's desiderata in the Persian Gulf, his Majesty's Government are anxious to avoid linking uiem if pousiole, cut in last resort, if satisfaction for Koweit can he secured in no other way, risk is one wnich will have to be faced.

My dear Rym, We are expecting to hold an interdepartmental conference in the near future to consider the whole question of the polio;/ to he followed as regards the proposed negotiations with Ibn $aud about Koweit-Hejd relations and Persian Gulf v questions, and we will sc© that the various points you raised in your telegram Uo # 87 of June Elat on this subject are then fully considered. Meanwhile it may be useful to you, for your personal and confidential information, to have the following indications of our attitude and general policy. In the first place I should perhaps explain that we should like to reach an early decision in the Koweit-2Iejd customs question quite apart from the other questions involved, is you may have seen from the old correspondence, we promised the Sheikh of Kcweit, at the end of last year, to help him to roach a satisfactory agreement with Ibn 3&amp;ud on this matter If he (the Sheikh of Koweit) played up properly as regards the Hejd rebellion. We are inclined to take the view that, largely on the strength of that promise, the Sheikh Old, on the whole, play up pretty mil; am it is therefore difficult for us to defer indefinitely intervening with Ibn Saud on his behalf in a matter which is of considerable importance to the economic life of Kowe.it On the other hand, the position a® regards ' 5 eroian Gulf questions is quite different. It was Ton Saud himself who/who took the initiative in asking for a discussion of these questions, and for a variety of reasons we are not anxious to embark on a discussion of some of the points involved unless it is inevitable* I enclose, for your confidential information, a copy of an old despatch from the Political Be si dent at BusMre to the Government of India, dated June 1st, 1929, from which you will see that some of the questions which I bn Sand wishes to raise are likely to prove difficult and tiresome, For instance, If there is to be any general discussion of Persian Gulf questions, Ibn Saud is sure to raise that of Be^di representation at Bahrein, Were we obliged to agree to the establishment of some kind of laJdi representative at Bahrein, our position might be rendered very difficult vis-h-vls the Persians, whose claim for representation in Bahrein we have steadily resisted, Share are other points also where a settlement with Ibn Saud of Persian Gulf questions might 1-ad to awkward reactions on our negotiatinns with Persia, am we should therefore have no reason to regret the post ponement of a general discussion with Ibn Baud until ou Persian negotiation* are considerate further advanced. I hope that the shove explanation will hel ? afraid, one of your most complicated yea know the result of oar inter- involved, however, oust; settle, more especial as freque i India is necessary and it is dif^- matter otherwise than by despatch. (sd.) a.®. HEimsi..hi ! A,/ '-Vi-' IBM BAUD'S REQUEST FOR A DISCUSSION OF PERSIAN GULF QUESTIONS LT'jH HIS'- MAJESTY' S GOVERNMENT. This question was first raised with the British Agent in Jedda in May 1929. Since then there has been considerable correspondence between the Hejazi authorities and His Majesty’s Government. Great difficulty has been experienced in securing any precise or detailed statement of the points which Ibn Baud wishes considered. The matter has been further complicated by discussions as to the channel through which negotiations - if they should come to anything - shall be conducted, and of the question whether the opportunity should not be taken to dispose of outstanding questions between Koweit and Nejd. The following note sets out very briefly the info mat ion we have received from the Hejaz Foreign Office on the questions for consideration, and the history of the discussion as regards the channel of n ego ti at ion. (/I) Questions for discussion:_ The Minister of Foreij Affairs originally stated that Ibn Baud n would like to discuss general question of relations in Persian Gulf’ 1 . The chief points His Majesty had in mind were stated to be - fa) Customs duties levied on articles destined lor nejci. (Fuad Hamsa subsequently amplified this oy staoing that the subject for discussion was tne customs dues and transit dues collected by the Bahrein Govemmenc on goods imported into 1 ejd, (Jedda despatch 150 of 19th June,- 1929 - P. 4644/29), At a later stage he stated that Ibn Baud took exception to the imposition of customs dues at Bahrein on goods destined for His Majesty’s Household or for the Hejaz Government (Jedda despatch 326 of 19th December, 1929 - P. 621/30).)(b) “ Trade facilities: No further reference has been made to this. (c) Nationality and passport questions, particularly withTreference to Nejd subjects in Bahrein, aid existing a * - \ practice there. Fuad Hamsa subsequently amplified this into 'certain points relating to the nationality and passports of His Majesty's subjects in the Persian Gulf' (Jedda despatch 150 of 19th June, 1929). (d) 11 Nejdi representatives in Bahrein and Koweit: This was subsequently amplified by Fuad Hamsa into ’’the position of His Majesty's Agents both in Bahrein and Koweit' (Jedda despatch 150 of 19th June, 1929). Repeated efforts to secure rather fuller information have been unsuccessful. VIEWS OF POLITICAL RESIDENT, BUSHIRE (COLONEL BARRETT), ON DESIDERATA ABOVE. (a) Any further customs concession would be resisted by Bahrein which, under pressure from His Majesty's Government, already levies 2% only instead of 5V ad EiLSrPAffM customs duty on goods re-exported within 20 days Oi their arrival to Arabian mainland ports. In Koweit uiie question oi customs..dues on articles destined for ejd is, of course, a problem of the first magnitude, io secure any concession, a much more accommodating -spirit would have to be shown by I bn Baud. \b; ^oin Bahrein and Koweit vjould welcome facilities ior trace no c injurious to themselves. As between Koweit and Nejd the obstacles come from I bn Baud. ^ -ilficolt to reply, in ignorance of specific point,.., i.ejdis passing through Bahrein are usually in possession of Kejdi passports, which are endorsed bythe Political Agent, t±lo grants a visa. About 50 visas are granted monthly. Nejdis not in possession of passports can easily obtain them at Qatif, four hours distant in a launch. Ihe Political Agent exercises jurisdiction over Ibn Baud’s subjects in Bahrein at his request. The Government of India have already expressed to the Resident their willingness to allow the Sheikh to deal with them. Ibn Baud .light be informed that if he desires the Government of India are willing to restore jurisdiction over Nejdis to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but to no other authority. (d) ihe strongest objections to the appointment of official Nejdi representatives 'to Bahrein or Koweit. CHANNEL OF NEGOTIATIONS. v ^ In the first instance it was c 1 eariy^contemplated\ that negotiations should be conducted through the Agency at Jedda (P. 34-73/29). In December 1929 Fuad Hamsa stated that ■one request originally communicated by him to the&lt;British Agent had been that a delegation should be sent uo Jedda to negotiate a settlement, or alternatively, that authority should be givai to the British Agency to negotiate. In a note vsrbale Fuad Hamsa gave as the .reason for the Rejazi request the fact that Icn Saud considered that the settlement of this subject by correspondence would take a long time. (M. The venue ?/as/changed from Jedda in 'February 1930, when Ibn Saud asked that the opportunity presented by his conference with the .-ling of Iraq and Sir Francis Humphrys' should be taken to discuss his Persian Gulf desiderata . He asked His iiajesty's Government to appoint a representative l ^ - ' for the purpose. Owing to shortness of notice this could not be arranged, but the King w^as officially informed that His majesty’s Government would be glad to arrange for a meeting at a/a later date between him and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, should he so desire, and should he be prepared meanwhile to supply them wi ch a full and. G.etailed statement as to his desiderata . The Hejaz Government, however, replied (Jedda telegram of 20th March, No. 38, on P. 2165) that 'it is not possible for the King 'bo meet present Resident in Persian Gulf about Persian Gulf affairs'. Further investigations show that Ibn Baud had taken offence at Colonel Biscoe’s unsuccessful efforts to prevent him from landing at Koweit on his return from the conference with King Faisal. Sir Andrew Ryan in May 1920 said 'I feel more strongly than I said in my telegram that it would be a mistake to pursue the matter | i.e., the reestablishment of friendly relations betweai the Resident and the King] just now, if it can be avoided. We migjat force the King into a definition oi his attitude from which he. would find it hard co receo.e, and the upshot might thus be actually prejudicial to xurther relations between him and Biscoe.'

Please see Mr. Rendel’s letter of 25th June below. A separate submission of a comprehensive character will shortly be made on the subject of the line to be taken with Ibn Baud as regards relations with Koweit, with particular reference to the raising of the customs emoargo, and also the line to be taken by our representative should Ion Baud press his demand to discuss certain Persian Gulf questions in which he is interested (official representatives m Bahrein, Koweit, etc.; passport and nationality questions; customs). The submission will also deal with the question whether it is desirable to press His Majesty, in present circumstances, to negotiate with Colonel Biscoe (it will be remembered that, as the result of the Resident’s unsuccessful efforts to prevent him from visiting Bahrein in February, he is not at present prepared to do so), or with some other British rap resen tative from the Gulf area, or whether it would be better to agree to negotiations conducted by Sir Andrew Ryan at Jedda with the assistance of one or two Persian Gulf experts. It is perhaps unnecessary to enter into the present position of these question s^in^ any detail now. Suffice it to say that we have ^ received the views both of the Resident and of the Government of India^and that, before discussing these questions generally at an in ter-Departmental conference, we await only a reply from the Government of India on the question whether their conclusions are in any way modified by the information they have now received of the reasons for which Ibn Saud is not prepared/ 3818a 5000 S.29bs prepared to meet the Resident. ^ ^ ^ir Andrew Ryan’s telegram of 21st June suggests that he is under some misapprehension as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards a discussio with Ibn Saud on Persian Gulf questions. The Foreign Office think it important to make the position clear to him in advance of and without prejudice to the discussion in the proposed in ter-Departmental meeting. Subject to the comments below, the line they suggest is, I think, generally satisfactory from our point of view. 3 As regards the urgency of a Koweit-Nejd settlement, the Government of India now express the view that this is not so great that it would be essential or desirable to negotiate immediately through anyone other than the Political Resident, and they are prepared to wait until such time as Ibn Saud is prepared to meet the Polluical Resident or to send a plenipo tentiary to . ^ negotiate with him. Whether their view is to be accepted must turn to a large extent on the proposed inter departmental discussion, but as they have taken this line, it is perhaps undesirable to go too far with Sir Andrew Ryan on the question of urgency, and I suggest a slight modification of the Foreigi Office draft. bimil arly, as regards Persian Gulf questions, may be impossible to avoid their discussion if we decide: press Ibn Saud to discuss the Koweit blockade, moreover, Colonel Biscoe suggests (Viceroy's telegram of 12th June, 1940-3) that a general discussion regarding qubotions in which the threat to raise Bahrein nsit dues could be used as a lever to secure concessi f ° r K0 JI 9 yw 1S onJ ’J method in which we are likely to 1 q vto apply pressure to His Majesty m the interests of/ w ■&lt; r-r , 1 ,^, Sj £ ' —£IM, it ons- Minute Paper. 3 FOREIGN Department. fritf tfiv i/i&gt; 3818a 5000 S.29 of the Principality. But, while we may for these reasons be forced to agree to a Persian Gulf discussion, we do not want to encourage one, and its results might be embarrassing not only, as the Poreigi Office suggest in their draft, as reacting on the Persian negotiations, but in other directions. Thus, the establishment, for instance, of an official X Neidi Agent in Kb we it, would make it extremely difficult for us to continue to refuse to agree to Iraqi and Persian Agents there also, while we do not know that Ibn Saud’s requirements in connection with ^passports and nationality regulations, which have been communicated to us only in the most general terms may not prove embarrassing when it comes to negotiation. r. I submit, in the circumstances, that I may be authorised to reply to Mr. Rendel as in the draft now put up.

We agree that the telegram can best be considered together with the other material available at the proposed inter-Departmental conference on the question generally. As you will have seen, we have telegraphed to the Government of India asking them whether they have any observations to offer additional to those contained in the Viceroy’s telegram, No. 1965-S, of the 13 June, in the light of the ^ p explanation - which they will now . ,-y have received - of Ibn Baud’s M * reluctance to meet Biscoe. Once their reply has reached us, the ground will be clear for a discussion; but we agree that it is unnecessary to wait until this has taken place to correct Ryan’s apparent -uncertainty as to our general attitude, and, subject to the/ /3 / e ? the following comments, we concur irl the line you propose to take in j f writing to him. 3 . In the first place (though this is little more than a question of wording) we are inclined to suggest that your reference to the settlement of the Koweit-Nejd customs question should suggest that an early decision was desirable, if ta ~ practicable, rather thanflt was of some urgency. We do indeed agree that it is desirable to get it settled as soon as we can, for the reasons stated by you: but if we use the word 'urgency' we may lead Ryan to uhink that we are even more anxious to reach a decision, and so to make some concession for the sake of doin, so, than is the case, and in view of the Viceroy's telegram of 13th June, 1965-S, we do not wish to coinmit ourselves too definitely until the proposed inter-Departmental meeting nas examined the question as a whole. As regards Persian Gulf questions, I am not quite sure whether a copy of the Political Resident's report to the Government of India on the points raisedgy Ibi Saud dated 1st June, 1929, of which copies were sent to you in our letter of the 5th/Draft Paper. ^*7 ■-■ -rr^ai i^GREiaN Department. ‘V (p~CuL U*.&lt;aA {oSZix.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.li,.- As My dear Laithwaite, I enclose a copy of a telegram from Ryan at Jeddah about the proposed negotiations with Ibn Saud on Koweit- Nejd relations and Persian Gulf questions. The letter of 29th May which he mentions merely sent Ryan, for his information, a copy of the Government of India’s telegram No.3672-S of December 17, (see your letter . A P.8146/29 of December 19 last), together with an explanation that, in view of the suggestion in paragraph 5 of the Bushire despatch No.2l of April 30, 'which was ♦ X still under consideration”, it seemed desirable to make sure that the JeddaK files on Nejd-Koweit questions should be complete. No doubt you will agree that the best plan will be to discuss this telegram from Ryan together with the other material we shall have before us, at the inter departmental meeting proposed in the Colonial Office I.G.Laithwaite ,Esq.letter No.77008/30 of May 26, if and when that meeting eventually takes place. Meanwhile, from this telegram Ryan appears not yet to have understood the position with regard to these questions, and we propose, subject to India Office concurrence, to write to him privately, if possible by bag leaving on Thursday, June 2 6, (although as time is so short we are prepared to wait until that of July 3), on the following lines. I would begin by explaining that the settlement of the Koweit-Nejd customs question is a matter of some urgency, since we promised the Sheikh of Koweit at the end of last year to help him to reach a satisfactory agreement with Ibn Baud on this matter, if he, (tne Sheikh of Koweit), played up properly as regards the Nejd rebellion. On the strength of that promise, the Sheildi did on the whole play up pretty well and it is therefore difficult for us to defer indefinitely intervening with Ibn Said on his behalf in a matter which is of considerable importance to the economic life of Koweit. On the other hand, the position as regards Persian Gulf questions is quite different. It was Ibn Saud himself initiative in asking for a discussion of this question who took theI question, and for a variety of reasons we are not anxious to embark on a discussion of some of the points involved unless this is inevitable. For instance, if there is to be any general discussion of Persian Gulf questions Ibn Saud is sure to raise the question of Nejdi representation at Bahrein. Were we to be obliged to agree to the establishment of some kind of Nejdi representative at Bahrein our position might be rendered very difficult vis-a-vis the Persians, whose claim for representation in Bahrein we have steadily resisted. There are other points also where a settlement with Ibn Saud of Persian Gulf questions might lead to awkward reactions on our negotiations with Persia, and we should therefore have no reason to regret the postponement of a general discussion with Ibn Saud until our Persian negotiations are considerably further advanced. We would add that the whole question of our relations with Ibn Saud in the Persian Gulf, and in connexion with Nejd-Koweit relations, is shortly coming up for inter departmental discussion, and that Ryan will be informed of the results of that discussion in due course.J i3 2 2 /96/9l) Deoypher. 3ir A.

I have not mastered Persian Gulf questions sufficiently to express official opinion hut it seems to me that any action taken on Customs policy on Noweit frontier would do little to elucidate it and nothing to overcome the difficulty. Although the King has refused to discuss Persian Gulf matters with Eiseoe it seems to he in the interests of all parties that they should he discussed with someone if it can he done without encountering insoluble problems of frontier and tribal control. Is it not worth considering the means of agreeing on programme of matters affecting No we it and Bahrein to form subject of a formal negotiation between the representa- tives? Biscoe would be obviously the best person to conduct it if the Aing r s present objection could be overcome. Alternatively it might be conducted in Jedda in December or January by me assisted by one or two Persian Gulf experts. Interval could be devoted to preparing the ground with Ibn Baud who himself asked for such a negotiation, preparation of programme and, if necessary, consultation between nis Majesty s Government and myself during the autumn. I put this up now though very tentatively so that if suggested procedure should seem feasible I might seize any opportunity that may offer of sounding His Majesty.o [ 4 3U56/86/V1) wosmm s*wa l?th June, 1930.

Xy dear Bendel, I write hurriedly to oatch the bag to explain that I am not following up my reply to your telegram Ho.73 of May 15 about the Ibn Saud Bieooe breeze by a despatch, because there ie really nothing of importance to add. My information reached me from Meooa and from a eouroe in the immediate entourage of the King, with a very oategorlcal request that no names should be named. It may be regarded as quite authentic and ae quite independent of the Buggestion in paragraph 2 of your telegram.! ^ J 6r^ r L^, The only other point worth mentioning is that the King holds or professes to hold that if he had not visited Bahrein, when in Its immediate neighbourhood, he would have been guilty cf a breach of established Arab politeness. I feel even more strongly than I said in my telegram that it would be a mistake to pursue the matter just now, if it can be ayoided. We might foroe the King into a definition of his attitude from which he would find it hard to recede; and the upshot might thus be actually prejudicial to further relations between him and Bisooe. 0,f * Bend el, Eeq.

With reference to your official letter No.79060/ 19 30 of the 21st February, I write to explain that, in view of the penultimate sentence of our telegram No.42 of the 31st February to Jedda, of which a copy went to you in our letter No .E.923/96/91 of the 24th February, we are inclined to think that it is hardly necessaiy now to instruct Bond to press for further particulars of the questions Ibn Saud wishes to raise in connexion with the Persian Gulf. I understand that the India Office share this view. As regards the third paragraph of your letter, it was agreed at an interdepartmental meeting held here yesterday., which Hall and Laithwaite attended, that the India Office should prepare for your concurrence and ours a draft telegram to the Government of India inviting their views on a proposal that a meeting, such as that suggested in our telegram to Jedda referred to above, should be 0.G.R.Williams , Esq.,arranged, to take place after the pilgrimage, between Ibn Saud and the Political Resident. Such a meeting could, the India Ofiice suggest, also he attended by the Sheikh of Koweit, and could deal not only with Persian Gulf questions but with Nejd-Koweit relations generally. I am inclined to think that this might afford a good solution of both problems, and that it would be far better than attempting to deal with either by correspondence; but it will be time enough, I think, to con si ie i\the question in greater detail when we receive the India Office draft.

If Ibn Saud feels strongly on the subject, and wishes to make his views known to Sir Francis Humphrys, the High Commissioner will be able to take note of them without committing himself in any way (he has not, at any stage, had any of the correspondence, so it would be impossible for him to express any opinion of his own).

Yours sincerely, (Signed} fUAD HAM4JUMKMX mMOHAOTIM Ifib !Tlie aatur© of* tlie Tarious aa6l nmaarous questions which. His Majesty has shown a desire to discuss with the British Government concerning the Persian Gulf is such that it is not likely that they will he solved by correspondence, I therefore met Mr. Jakins on Wednes day, May 15th last, in his bedroom (as he was ill that day) and informed that His Majesty the King might not be able to stay long in the Hejaz after the pilgrim age but was likely to leave for Nejd about the middle of Babi Awal (middle of August) and as there are different questions relating to the problems of the Persian Gulf, His Majesty wished to discuss matters with the British Government either by negotiations with a representative to be selected for this purpose by the British Govern ment, or with the British Agency if the British Govern ment consider this suitable. I did not think for a moment that Mr. Jakins had misunderstood what I intended, because I clearly stated to him that we would orefer the deputation to come directly after the pilgrimage so that we should have ample time. He told me that the British Government might find difficulties in sending a special mission for that purpose. I then made it clear to him that it did not matter whether the negotiations are made with a special representative, or with the British Agency, but the important thing is that the negotiations should take ■olace. On May 30th, he had a conversation withme and informed me that his Government have asked him to enquire about the questions we intend to raise. He added that his belief in the possibility of deputing an official mission was weak hecause this would entail considerable expenditure to the Government and, the treasury. On the same day and in accordance with my request he sent me a private note to ask me about the points it is desired to discuss. I am glad to be able to explain the question to you and to inform you that the fundamental intention of the request is that both Governments may be able to study the subject in its three parts (which X have ment ioned later in my private memorandum) to the effect that negotiations may be made between representatives of both parties because His Majesty has said that the settle ment of the subject by correspondence would take a long time.

' tq Political Agent at Bahrain reports that since our shipment oi arms to Bin Baud, members of Qusaibi family have been adopting increasingly arrogant attitude. One has gone so far as to summon Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa to his house and there abuse him severely for uttering anti-Bin Baud sentiments. Abdulla was angry but the humourous side struck him and he has treated matter as a joke. In view of the arrogant attitude adopted by Bin Saudis commercial agent towards the Deputy Ruler's own brother and as the Political Pgent and Adviser consider Shaikh Hamad to be so dazzled by Join Baud as to cause them to fear that the transfer to Bahrain State of jurisidctlon over Majdis might lead to Majdis headed by Qusaioi acquiring privileged position dangerous to public safety, I suggest modification of recommendation con tained in paragraph (c) of my Express Message under reference. Jeddah’s endorsement of June 19th shows that no progress has been made in the discussion oi general questions relating to the Gulf referred to in his telegram Mo.62 to the Foreign Office, and I now recommend that at this opening stage no mention should be made to Bin Baud of Government’s attitude towards jurisdiction over Majdis in Bahrain. ^CLOSURE IN :iSN SECRETEC0jp$O Ho. 150. * 6 4 9 MDm f 19^9 -45KL.

Any further concession would be resisted by State. In Kuwait the question of customs dues on articles destined for iTejd is problem of first magnitude. Bin Saud would have to approach it in much more accommodating spirit than he has hitherto shown. It is possible that, if Bin Saud makes concession in matters such as control over Awazim tribe, Shaikh may be willing to reopen A question which at present he considers to touch his honour and his sovereign independence* l (b) Facilities for trade not injurious to themselves would be welcomed by both Bahrain and Kuwait. It is Bi-n Saud and not the Shaikh who puts obstacles in the way of | trade between Kuwait and Bajd. (e) In ignorance of specific points it is hard to reply. Fajdis passing through Bahrain are usually in possession of passports signed by one of Bin Saud’s Amirs which are brought to the Political Agent, who endorses X them to certify the genuineness of the signature of the Amir and grants his visa. About fifty visas for India» Iraq, Kuwait, etc., are granted monthly. Hajdis not inpossession of passports can easily obtain them at Qatif,which is distant four hours in launch. This involves much less 'big country like India. At request of Bin Saud the Political Agent assumed jurisdiction over his subjects in Bahrain. Government of India have already, in letter to this Residency, expressed their willingness to allow the Shaikh to deal with them. I suggest that Consul be informed that, if Bin S a ud desires. Government of India are willing to restore jurisdiction over Hajdis to Shaikh of Bahrain but to no third party. (d) At all costs proposal to appoint Hajd official representative to either Bahrain or Kuwait should be resisted.

Five snare copies for distribution b,y jOd are submitted as usual. (a) Kuwait Tribes (Araibdar and Pidawiyeh). As anticipated in paragraph 1(a) of ray last October ,1931. summary summary, these sections moved away from Jaxiara in a soutnerly direction about 25th October. They are now camped near Um Buss and in the Saada area, and .nink from Kabd and al-Tawil wells. The move of triese sections will be gradual and until rain falls will o f Kuwa iv , ur duiiv Incidentally also they will be able to Dhafiri yj /:i, i i i ; Dhafir ssctioiiB, who bxo grazing in ino Bnao^Q and who also drink at Bubaihiyeh. v ' ' : Lb) Mutalr . (i) Witrifthe the exception of a few tents still reported at Safa and Jarriya, the whole trite has left water and are now camped in the Subhan, Mujdair and southern Garaa regions or roughly between Khabari Wadtha and hafar al Batin. Tney water at Jariya, Safa Wabra and Hafar. Though there has been no rain as yet, there is ample dry grazing left over from last year , in this area. ( ii) The reported deahi of Faisal al-Duwish ( for details of which see below) has caused widespread consternation and gloom throughout tne tribe, and with it increased bitterness and hatred against Bin baud. The common belief is that the King has murdered him. Others on the other hand are spreading the story that Bin Saud, believing that ids Majesty’s Government were about to ask for his release after his 2 years incarceration, decided to give out that he had died of disease so as to be able to give a suitable reply when His Majesty’s Government’s demand came, but that in reality he was still living and well. This latuer story is certainly believed by trie lady Maziuna bint Sultan, own sister of al-Duwish who arrived in Kuwait on 23 rd October and visited the political Agent on two occasions to discuss the report. (in) Shaikh Hazza ibn Badr who secretly entered Kuwait and visited the political Agent on 29 th October, was inclined to believe In tne truth of tne ropoiu, though he remarked that no one had acouallii ° eei1 dead or buried except the guards.( iv) The same person reported that Bin Baud’s blockade had recently taken a new Xorm and that now Shaikh Jadaan’s ”Dha£ir M elements were very active in preventing people from entering or leaving Kuwait territory and that all persons taken by them, had their goods confiscated, except their camels, which latter were sent to Bin Baud’s official ibn Muharib ai-Jarriya. he added that although Snaikh Jadaan had nor yet returned from Riath, the Dhafir had obviously received clear and definite orders from the King to act as they were doing in order that he, the King, could reply to any official complaints made by Kuwait, that Nejd tribes were not trie aggressors, but that the rascally Dhafir, an Iraq tribe, which was not under his orders or control, were to blame. Comments . The writer is inclined to believe in the correctness of this story, both because such a move would be typical of Bin Baud, and secondly because of the fact that the Mutair have not fallen upon the Dhafir and driven tnem out of their territory, a thing they could easily do, were it not that they obviously feared the consequences (from Bin Baud). U) (C) ] Nothing to report except (d) Bnammar j that all have either moved (e) Harb j away from water or are in (f) Awa&amp;M. process of doing so. (g) Dhafir. (Shaikh Jadaan al-Buwait). These have left Subaihiyeh wells and are all camped in the -araa region west of the Simqq, except for a very few tents. They still drink from Subaihiyeh wells.wells* Their ohaikhs Jadaaii has not yet returned from Hiath. (ii) Ajemi al-Kuwait’s following who latterly joined Jadaan’s people at Subaihiyeh, have gone west again, apparently under orders and they now drink from al-Hafar rather proving the writer’s contention that the Bhafir are being used for blockade purposes, Jadaan’s people guarding the southern routes into Kuwait, and Ajemi’s the Southwesterly approaches. H iXNISh. This apparently took place in Hiath on 3rd October ,1931. The immediate cause being 'Aneurism” of the heart. The first news was brought to Kuwait on 25th October, 1931 by one Ibrahim al-Muzaiyin, for many years standard bearer to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, but who a year ago took service under Bin Baud at Riath; and wno now returned to Kuwait to buy falcons for Mohamed bin Baud the King’s brother. The man Ibrahim recounted in detail how al-Duwish had for a month previously been complaining of pain in the lower part of his taro at due to a pronounced swelling. How that on 3rd October whilst walking about with ibn Hathlain, he nad suddenly fallen to the ground, blood gusaing from nis mouth, obviously caused by the swelling in his jugular having burst inward. How that he had remained senseless till evening and tnen recovered conciousness for a few minutes, during which he had asked to see the King. How tnat when the latter refused ro come, al-Duwish sent him farewell greetings and said he forgave him all tnat he had done to him, but tnat final judgment between them was still to be wnen tney both(R9r20) Wt 18117/2750 10,000(2) 12/31 H &amp; Sr Gpll2 B 12b v Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted ^7 f {r^~^ INDIA DIRECT Subject: t./ 4- j e --—** Reference to previous correspondence: lr \ Letter the Colonial Office of the jrom ^ J Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

One copy is being sent to Jedda and 5 copies to you. X. Tribal Locations^ ftg,. (a) Ganeral. Hot a little excitement Has been oawsed in Kuwait and among the North-Eastern tribes of Arabia, in particular among the Kutair and Ajraen, at the news of the incipient revolt which recently broke out in Borthern &gt;-ejaz under the leadership of al Rafadah (see paragraph 489-491 of Iraq Command's fortnightly intelligence summary Ho,12.} The news of this individual's activities has quickly crossed to the Persian Gulf and naturally in the process has gained colour. The Ajman and Kutair are secretly jubilant and hope, that the operations of Al Hafadah will grow into something big. They have no love for His Uajesty King Bin Baud and if they saw a chance,would tHa®selves undoubtedly taketake a hand in the game. At present they understand that a premature move would be fatal for they have by no means recovered from the punishment inflicted on them by the King for their part in the Akhwan rebellion. It is rumoured from the Artawiyah and Jerriya that the Hut aim west of Hail are already giving trouble and that a small punitive force sent against them by the Governor of Hail ibn Musaad has been cut up and destroyed. At present there is no confirmation of this report, further rumours have it that Bin gaud ha© ordered contingents of his faithful Sbei and Sailed tribes to move with the A1 Harb towards the Berth-west of Arabia and that the move has commenced under the leadership of AX Firm, A© against this it is credibly reported that the latter chief went to K a din a two months back to marry one of the Hejas Harb ladies and as far as is known he is ©till there. Speaking generally however there is undoubtedly a good deal of secret moving about of messengers among the Ajm&amp;n and F'utair these days, which one cannot help but think is connected with the At Rafadah 1 s operations. Beyond this one cannot say much at present, (b) Kuwait Tribe© {Araib&amp;ar and Fidawiyeh), These remain concentrated round Subalhiyeh, although the Kuwait Ajman group have detached themselves under the chief Hahar a! Mutalaqim, and have gone from, the south into the Kuwait Beutral Zone, They are now camped round about Shathaf,tafra and ’Ark, The move may mean nothing more than a desire to ease the situation by scattering in search of grazing. On the other hand there may be an idea behind the move,to give the Southern Ajman a rallying point should necessity arise. SorB©* Soni'* of th® Kuwait Aratclar have moved South to the “Suda* region on the coast south of the Eeutral Zone. -«) AwaSim. Hothing fresh to report. Most of the tribeshas moved into Kejd in search of gracing. (d) Hut air. Shaikh 5'arhan bin Sihmi as Sur, accompanied by Sheikh Abdulla bin Jidii visited the Political Agent on 18th June. Both these leaders reside at Jarriya and are more or lose followers of Shaikh Tarahib ibn Shuqair the noted Mutair leader who remined faithful to Bin Baud during the Akhwan rebellion. Their presence in Kuwait was apparently to get news of events in North Hejaz. They reported that grazing was so bead rouni Ha far al Batin that moat cf the Braih section of the Kutair had moved south across the Uahana, into hejd. under bin Asnwan and ibn Jarbuh. Only SO tents remained behind under Ali el Shuwairibat. A rather pathetic incident occurred while these two Shaikhs were in the Agency. Ihe Political Ag^nt had occasion to produce an enlarged photograph of Kraiaal al Duwish and asked if they recognised the likeness. Both men did so at once and then to the writer's surprise hurst into tears and showered kisses on the photograph. Nothing can instance the extraordinary worship and devotion felt for their late leader, by the Butair tribesmen than this little incident. I think J have had occasion to mention before that thir family of al Duwioh are not ordinary tribal Shaikhs, they in the eyes of Arabs generally, stand out as veritable 'Kings' among the Bedouin tribes of Arabia and can be compared to the Al Saud themselves or the al Rasehid, only without their money. Shaikh Ridden bin Wat ban al Buwish, accompanied by a minor Shaikh called Rumaiyikh bin Dahan visited the Political Agent on 30th June. These shaikhs are attached toto ibn Shtsq&amp;ir al Jarriya and bo were outwardly loyal to His Majesty .King Bin Saud. They confirmed the story that al Firm of the Karb had gone to i a dine, to get married and enlarged on Bin Saud 1 s present policy,which they said was to split every tribe in hejd into two parties and keep them hostile to each other. Outwardly this policy was successful my informants naively remarked, but it would not stand the strain of a serious conflagration. Incidentally Shaikh Bidden was in the disaster of 0m al Buthumah when Azaiyiz,Faisal al iXawisbhs son was cut off and killed with 400 of his braves during the Akhwan rebellion of 1929/30. he spoke at length of the engage ment and how he with only 200 escaped, (e). Mi^a. Shaikh Khalid bin M©homed al Hathlain known as Sib Salman today the paramount Shaikh of the Ajman and at present an outlaw with the majority of Ajman chiefs, in Iraq, suddenly appeared in Kuwait on the 24th June and called on the Political Agent on the 26th June. This debonair and handsome young warrior v &gt; f * quite one of the fewest types to be found in Arabia today, enjoys an allowance from His Majesty King Faisal and is under his personal protection. When interviewing me he came straight to the point and enquired all about the troubles in Korth H@ja£,and whether there was any hope of al Bafadah being successful. If he was then he said his place was with his tribe whose whereabouts he had full details although to the world they were scattered. It would be easy collect them at once if necessary. I advised him to put away such thoughts and returnreturn without delay to where his fellow Shaikh® were camped In Iraq i # e, South-west of Shinafiyeh and 1 ejef and near Buhba, This advice was also in accordance with the Shaikh of Kuwait wnG had previously told me that the man 11 ® presence here was un esirable, and would of course be reported to Bin Baud by AX lafisi. Shaikh lilialid took my advice and left the next day for Basrah after secretly and by ni^it visiting the many Ajman tents lying under the walls of Kuwait. Actually before he reached Kuwait and whilst he was still at Jahara, Shaikh Khalid it seems had detached Faith al Had!, a confidential messenger to Jarriya to get news. This man returned shortly after his master 1 gs return to Iraq and visited the Agency to impart what nmm hs had been able to collect. H« confirmed the story of the destroying of Bin ilusaad*as ®Sarriya* by the Hutaim. Bliafir. Ajemi as Suwait is still camped at Ha far al Batin. J&amp;d&amp;an as Suwait together with ibn Jurraiyid one of his few faithful chiefs suddenly moved from near Ruhail and Athaiba on about 17th June and made for Jsdiara. At the moment of writing Jadaan with 20 tents is earaped at Jahara and ibn Jurraiyid on the Bahra immediately north of Kuwait across the bay.with 40 tents. Jadaan came into Kuwait on 19th June and again asked the Shaikh if he would receive him as his subject (see paragraph I (e) of Summary Ho. 89 for month ending 15th June) as he had given up all hopes of receiving good treatment from Iraq or h@j d. The Shaikh consulted me and I advised that Jadaan and ibn Jurraiyid be allowed to remain in Kuwait territory at any rate during the summer months. The question of his allegiance need not be discussed I said. JadaanJada&amp;n visited the Political Agent on 20th June and explained his case at length* He had he said, left Iraq because they had Imprisoned him, to his shame, and he had given up the idea of serving Bin Baud, because the latter had required him to submit to the orders of Ajerai as Suwait, his junior. His only course now was to become a true and loyal subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait. When 1 asked him to whom he was prepared to pay fi Zikat* he said *to ibn Subah**. To my enquiry as to whether he had signed any document of allegiance to Bin Baud he replied “no*. On 22nd June Shaikh Ghanaim the som of ibn Jurraiyid, called at the Agency and discussed latest events in the He j ass. H© offered his services as a secret agent, but this was declined* He imparted the information that the Beni Hussain and al Said sections of the Itiafir had also camped at Jahara. C~ ii. oil xm-atssTs Major frank Holmes left for the United Kingdom by air on Thursday 30th June* He appeared confident that he would get his Kuwait Oil Concession through by means of negotiation in London. Before he left he hinted that it was not beyond the possibility of things that Ms company might later offer the controlling interest in their Bahrain oil to His Majesty’s Covern^ent. This was an interesting piece of information. M@ reaffirmed his belief that the days of the Anglo Persian Gil Company were numbered, and that their end would come through Russian pressure. III. Action of the Basrah Courts in the case of the Shaikh’s Kaddaghiyeh Property. Reference paragraph VII of Kuwait summary Mo.68 of 16th May. AtAt the request of the Political Agent a full report was obtained from the Shaikh on 15th June 1932, summarising the whole history of the case as regards the 'Bashiyeh* gardens and the Fa&amp;daghiyeh gardens, both of which iidth a 3rd garden called W A1 Kharm* for® part of the well known Paddaghiyeh estate, one of the five properties exempted by His 'Majesty* s Government from Revenue in perpetuo for services rendered in the great war* On the 25th June, the Shaikh followed up his previous letter by formally requesting His Majesty’s Government in their capacity of the Protecting Power to look into the case and safeguard his interests in the matter of these gardens, for as he said he felt that the scales were too heavily weighted against him in Iraq to make it possible for him to defend himself successfully in the courts there* In a subsequent conversation with the Political Agent he reaffirmed his belief that there was a regular comspiracy af 0 ot to deprive him of his gardens out of revenge for their having been exempted from payment of revenue,and only the direct intervention of His Majesty’s Government could save him* A detailed report on the whole trouble has been submitted to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In the meantime deep concern is felt as to the outcome of the appeal* for as things stand, the Shaikh has been ordered by the Courts to return the ,, Bashiy@h , * garden or a portion of it, to the heirs of the original owner, in spite of the fact that the Shaikh’s of Kuwait bought it 23 years ago and have been in unchallenged possession ever since* further an attempt appears to be about to be made also in the courts to attack his main Faddaghiyeh estate,which if successfulsuccessful will mem that property for which £60000/. was pa.id 23 years ago ‘by Shaikh Mubarak his grandfather,will be in jeopardy/ 7 I have etc., (Sgd) H,K,P.Dickson Lieut-Col.

Hejd.Armed Forces in Kuwait Territory * Sir, Will you kindly refer to my confidential despatch Ho.40 dated the 26th March and paragraph 13, I have the honour to forward a translation of I bn Kbraimis* letter in reply to those sent by Shaikh Adbullah al Jabir and Abdullah an-llafisi in the absence of the Ruler. The letter is addressed to the former, 2* Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the letter refer to a came1 which was stolen from Shaqra and brought to Kuwait, and need not concern us* 3. Paragraphs 3 and 4 refer to the case under reference. You will see that while Ibn Khraimis makes proper apology for the acts of his junior officer ^Mubarak' and says such aggression will not recur again, he in true Kejdian style adds that he has given the (quite unwarranted) order that Hejd subjects who may be found inside the Kuwait border will be moved back into Bejd territory, and only allowed to enter if armed with a letter from himself Ibn Khraimis to the Shaikh. 4. This order is directed against several Awasim and Jutair shepherds who attracted by the recent rain have moved up from the south and are now grazing their animals just inside Kuwait territory round the 2 lakes thatthat have formed near Manaqish in the Shaqq. Ibn Khraimi^ argument no doubt being that if Najdis graze in Kuwait territory they will draw supplies from Kuwait, which must not be allowed* 5. The Shaikh who has in the meantime returned from Riath is satisfied with the apology, and thinks no further action is necessary* I agree with him. 6* Regarding hejd shepherds in Kuwait territory the iihaikh thinks that Ibn Khraimis is labouring under a misunderstanding, as it is obviously not the King f s desire to interfere with tribesman in search of better grazing, and that by recent agreement with the King only those Mejdis having a complaint against someone in Kuwait need be armed with a letter from Ibn Khraimis to himself* He proposes therefore writing to Ibn Khraimis and clearing up the matter. 7. In connection with this and similar border incidents, the bhaikh tells me that he had a most useful and friendly talk with the King recently in Riath* The latter made a point of saying that he knew he had most untrustworthy officers on the frontiers whose one aim and object was to spoil neighbourly relations and he filly authorised him the Shaikh, fco issue direct instructions on his behalf to his official Ibn Khraimis if any time he saw him going wrong. The King also mentioned that he was quite aware that his frontier 'barriyas” more often than not 'looted 1 ’ and 'stole' from blockade runners, for their own benefit, as very rarely were the articles or camels taken credited to the State or himself. It was entirely easy he added for these persons to send their loot home to their people without his knowing. 8. While such easy explanations bear a rather familiar ring, we must I think accept them in the present case.ease* The Shaikh in any ease wants to believe the best of Ibn Saud just now, after the wonderful and generous reception that was recently accorded him by the King in \ Hi ath* 1 have, etc., (Sgd) H.R.P.

I have received your 2 letters dated the 18th 20th Dhil iadah 1350 (25th and 27th March 1932) and noted the contents of both and I greatly thank you for your kindly handing over, in response to our letter, the robber ’Id bin Mashauwih al-Maiabl to our ma, 2. Your statement with regard to the she-camel on which he came to you, has been noted by me, and I beg to / inform you that 1 have received a communication from Ibn Isa of hhaqra saying that it the camel was stolen from them. Will you please therefore, be so good as to hand it over also together with its gear to our man 5aud &amp;t~ Turaifi. 3. Also you wrote that some misunderstanding had been caused by our men, under Mubarak Abuthnain, who had crossed the frontier and reached Urn al-iiiman. 'Phis, indeed, is a bad error on their part, which we do not accept, and indeed they were never directed by me to do so, but seeing that Bajd subjects had moved towards your side, and being gnorant persons, they I suppose followed them. 4. This was no doubt due to their ignorance, as whatever the case may be, we would never agree such action and, therefore, as soon as we got the news, we sent them the necessary instructions, which were to be strictly followed by them, and we ordered that neither themselves nor any of our subjects should cross the frontiers. We also ordered them to have our subjects moved outside the frontier and to make them understand that anyone who might desire to proceed to your side, should first obtain(£9720) Wt 18117/2750 10,000(2) 12/31 H &amp; SP Gp 112 ^50 B 12 b Comjnunications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— ^ INDIA Dll £.

You will have seen the subsequent correspondence that took place on this subject between His Majesty 1 s Minister at Jedda and tajself, but it maybe as well to amplify slightly the account therein contained. 3. Briefly the facts are as follows* In the correspondence ending with m despatch Mo.786-3 of 23rd Howmber 1931 to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, of which a copy mis sent to you under my printed letter Ic.22 of the same date, I brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Minister certain incidents of intrusion by the armed forces of Mejd into Kuwait territory. Sir Andrew Ryan thereupon brought the matter to the-notice of the Mejd Government and asked them to instruct all frontier officials that neither they nor their men must enter Kuwait territory without proper sanction. Fuad Hamm either deliberately or inadvertently misrepresented the matter to the King and telegraphed to him to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had asked that in future no wejdis should enter Kuwait. ling 1bn Saud took an ea rly opportunity of raising the question and aaid that he had been Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.iUo teen surprised at this demand hut that he had agreed to it and had reaiprocated by ordering that in future no Kuwaitis should be allowed to enter Kejd, and had issued orders accordingly to his frontier official# through his trade Agent at Kuwait, Al Safisi. 1 explained that there appeared to be a complete misunderstanding on the subject; V , -.. • K- i't’f that the objections of Kuwait were to his officials and their men entering Kuwait territory, and that as he knew perfectly well, so far from wishing to keep out Kejdis, there was nothing the Shaikh of Kuwait desired more than that Hejdie should visit Kuwait freely and without restriction# Ibn Sand at once accepted my assurance and said that he would cancel his orders, which he did by letters addressed to llafisi and sent through Colonel Dickson on his return. 4. I reported the misunderstanding to Sir Andrew Ryan, in my telegram Ho#?.23 of 29th January, which was ret-aahid to you, and the matter was subsequently cleared i 4 up at Jedda in a personal letter addressed by Sir Andrew Ryan to Fajud Bey. The incident my therefore now be considered as closed. While the misunderstanding may of course have been due to the ineptitude of the Bejd | Foreign Office it is somewhat difficult to believe that I the misrepresentation was other than deliberate and, had 1 not met the ling when I did* the matter would probably have taken some time to clear up.

To The Hon , 'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire • 1-eJd Armed forces in Kuwait Territory . Sir, I have the honour to report the following fresh incursion of armed forces of His Majesty King ibn Baud into Kuwait territory. 2 . Apparently on or about 14th March Ibn Khraimis the liejdear Officer in charge of' the Horth-Sastern border of Mejd, and incidentally the official responsible for the proper management of the blockade, detached a negro officer by name 'Mubarak* and six men to the Kuwait Keutral zone lying between the Shaqq and the sea with instructions to move about secretly from point to point and seise any Kejd tribesmen they could find removing supplies from Kuwait. 3. On 15th March : ubar&amp;k moved up with his 6 men and bivouaced at Arfajiyeh, a group of six wells Gouth-K&amp;st of Burgan hills and close to Shlnaiti wells. The group of wells mentioned is not marked on any official map, but lies 8 miles inside the Kuwait border. 4. On 16th the whole party openly and by day moved from Arfajiyeh to a point slightly south of Jhuaiba village on the coast, (some 20 miles inside the boundary) and seized S Beni Khalid tribesmen moving south with supplies which they had purchased in Kuwait. The men were bound, beaten and together with their camels were driven off to a hollow near somesame wells called urn al Himan lying one mile from the sea, in the vicinity of some vegetable gardens known locally as al Mas ra. 5. Mubarak remained at Um al Himan, operating from his hollow, and threatening all and sundry with dire penalties if they divulged his hiding place, until the evening of the 20th March when he returned to Arfajiysh, with a quantity of loot and about 15 captured camels. sn route he seized a couple of unoffending Awazlm tribesmen, their camels dn&lt;i s ' hee P» marched them off also, although they apparently were unconnected with any blockade running. 6 . At the time of these events I myself happened to be in camp at Araifjan, a point six miles south of Um al iliman and hearing whispers of the 'Sarriyas' (armed party) activities proceeded alone by car to Um al Himan an the mornirg of 21st March but found the party flown. My intention was to warn the leader that he could not operate inside Kuwait territory and to turn him and his party out. 7 • 3 2nd March I returned to Kuwait and in the absence of His Excellency the tihaikh at Rlath, X suggested to ihaikh Abdullah al Jabir who was acting for him, that he should immediately send out messengers to the armed party and tell them to retire and at the same time write a strong protest to Ibn Khraimis who was camped at Riga!. I also arranged that Abdullah al aafiai, Bin Saud's agent in Kuweit should also do the same r Ihe necessary letters were at once sent. d ♦ 83rd March I again proceeded on say own to Arfajiyeh to find and interview Mubarak but was told that he had inoved south into ifeutr&amp;l Zone# X found the countryside jo a regular panic and met many groups of poor Kuwait Bedouin fleeing in a Westerly direction to avoid having their flocks of sheep taken# 9. While I was at Affajiyeh two cars containing the ihaikh f s men accompaned by AX Hafisi’s son crossed into Keutral zone and came up with Mubarak at Al Ratawi, a point north-'n north-east of Wafra (hot not on map). He had only 2 men. .tie said that the remaining 12 men of his party (not 6 as previously reported) were still in Kuwait territory but would return in the evening. With Mubarais were 20 captured camels and a quantity of captured goods. 10 . iiafisi*s son then ashed Mubarak by what right were his armed party moving about well inside Kuwait territory disturbing the whole countryside, causing panic and seizing and beating persons* His reply given in rather boastful manner was that he had orders to pursue and capture any Hejd subjects, who entered Kuwait territory and that boundaries to him and his party were nothing. They were soldiers who obeyed orders and that until these were changed he would continue to cross the border as much as he chose. This reply apparently annoyed A1 Hafisi’s son, who said 'I am personally cognisant of Bin Baud 1 s orders on the subject of Hejd armed parties crossing the border, as these were recently conveyed to Ibn Subah under special letter from the iving which 1 saw' . This appeared to sober Mubarak somewhat who changed his tone and agreed to refer the matter to Xbn Khraimis his superior officer. 11 . Bafisi in subsequent conversation with me said he did not believe Mubarak would refer to his master as he was of the determined bullying type who probably knowingly exceeded his orders, and was engaged in an expedition of private loot. 12. Mubarak incidentally told the leader of the shaikhs escort that his orders were to watch the area from the Bhaqq to the sea, but when asked H south of what line ” he replied that that part did not concern him. 13. I have narrated the above incidents at length in case further action may have to be taken later in the form of a protest to Bln Saud. Por; For the present however I counsel doing nothing until 1 am in a position to report exactly what action Xbn lOiraimis takes on Abdullah al Jabir and Al Hafisi’s letters. It is possible, though not probable I think, that hubarak was acting without authority, and as suggested by al ilafiai*a son was on a private raiding expedition* For the moment he and his party are out of .Kuwait, and in the ileutrai zone. If I bn Khraimis does the right thing and reprimands his subordinate and forbids such incidents in future, there will I think be no need for His Majesty’s Government to make an official protest* The incidents complained of course happened when Shaikh Ahmad- was Bin Baud’s guest at Riath* 14.

They were mostly of the poor variety .aid were accompanied by their women folk md children in almost every case.

It will be noticed that the King’s communications are couched in very friendly terms. The Shaikh of Kuwait is replying that he agrees to His Majesty’s suggestions except that the right of search amongst Kuwait tribesmen in Kuwait territory should be confined to the individual Nejd subject who has lost property and that the Shaikh will not permit other Nejd tribesmen to assist. The proviso is intended to prevent any excuse for the intrusions of Nejdi patrols into Kuwait territory.

Dependencies, Riydh, to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir as Subah, K. C. I.E. ,C. S. L ,Ruler of Kuwait, Kuwait. mm m You know, may God keep you safe, that the most earnest thing I, your brother,, wish is the uprightness of affairs and the establishment of tranquility, and our utmost desire is to make the Governments of both of us like one Government, you can represent us in dealing with our subjects in youri territory where they meet with injustice or difficulties, and can also prevent them from committing evil and can point out to them the proper path just as if they were your own subjects and we shall do same as well. Our motive for such a comment is that we have lately noticed that some dissatisfaction has been shown on your side, on certain points. We have, therefore, decided to explain matters to you. The persons who live in both your as well as our territories, are all of one class and one race, and verily robbers exist in both territories, and you know full well that by giving trouble to you or to us over matters which may not be true, they hope to create confusion between both of us, and between our subjects. Meanwhile we have sent your servant Ibn Khuraimis to protect the right of our subjects and dissuade them from transgressions, and the rights of the Iraq subjects, according to the agreement concluded between them and us. We nave also instructed him to be a servant to you and to comply with any instructions that may reach him from you in connection with any rights due to your dependents. And for your information we have mentioned our orders issued to him as stated above. But still there is a question in which we find a groundground for difficulty. It concerns the rights of the tribes amongst themselves, that is to say, it may happen thao a subject of one party ha.s a case against the an acquaintance or cousin, who is the subject of/other party. Also there may be camels robbed or strayed from 6± uner side. please give us your ideas on these matters. I, your brother’s opinion on the subject is, tnat any persons who may have rights due to them by others or who may have lost some camels , they shall have the right to cross the frontiers and demand their rights from the persons who have injured them or search for their camels, whether robbed or strayed, put up with the person with whom the camels are found and demand them from them. If that person or persons restores them without coercion or dispute, well and good, but if they refuse to do so, then if the robbed or lost property or other rights be in Kuwait territory, they should refer the matter to whomever you may like, whether to yourself or to officials appointed by you or an-Nafisi who will approach you in the matter. Similarly if the otfenders be in our territory the injured party or parties can obtain satisfaction by reporting to our officials. There is H ibn Khuraimis w who is in charge of our immediate borderland. Also for dealing with Shammar, Harb and their dependents there is 'Marjan', IbnMusaad’s servant. If the matter is not settled by tnem, the injured party should report his or their cases, if it concerns Nejd proper to our son Baud,, if it concerns Hass aHassa to Abdullah ibn Jiluwi, and if it falls within the jurisdiction of the North, to ibn Musaad or ibn Mubarik. (Buraida). Should the latter officials take the necessary action, well and good. Otherwise you may write to me, your brother, in the matter, and I shall be prepared to do the needful. Also there is the question of the robbed camels from both the people of Nejd and the people of Kuwait. When the owner recognises his camel with anyone from among the subjects of either sides, whether in town or desert he shall nave the right to prove that the camel is his property and the camel shall be restored to him as decided between us and you. And provided that the man with whom the camel be found knows the persons from whom he bought it, the Government in whose territory the robber may be, should restore the camel to the original owner, and punish the robber. Should he have bought it from an unknown person, he shall have to restore the camel to its original owner, enquire about the person from whom he bought it and, when found sue him to the Government who should reover his money* This question has already been decided between us and you, but it pleases us to repeat it again for protecting the rights of the subjects of both sides and the comfort of ail and to cut the robbers’ hands. The first question is the one we should like to know your opinion about, please therefore , let us know about seme so that we may be aware about same and instruct our .Amirs accordingly.

Persian Gulf . The meeting between Ibn Saud and Col. Biscoe: the Koweit blockade question. Copy of to Previous Papers FOR INFORMATION. The top despatch gives a general account of the long projected meeting which has at last taken place. It was a great success; the King seems to have put all memories of the Bahrein incident of early 1930 from his mind and his attitude was most cordial. He hoped that a further meeting might take place and dictated a message of friendship to His Majesty f s Government (pp.6-7). He was very gloomy about his financial difficulties but the Resident considers that in Nejd at any rate, though he has somewhat lost his position as a spiritual leader, his writ still wonio Jwo unquestioned.

( cj. .(W. )M so aL^ 3, The second despatch (pp.9-15) discusses the Koweit blockade question. A very brief summary of the position will be found in para.15 of Colonel Bi«coe T s despatch at P.Z.1234/31 (flagged). It was decided at the inter-departmental conference last P.2 August, at which Sir A.Hyan and Colonel Biscoe were both present, that a threat to raise the Bahrein transit dues might prove a useful weapon in any discussions on the subject. (At the moment a new development in this question is under discussion between the Resident andthe Government of India, who will make recommendations to &lt; His Majesty*s Government - P.Z.1589/32). It will be seen that, in his recent interviews with the Resident, the King was at first intransigent, pleading his financial^ troubles and his fear of loss of revenue if goods entered Nejd through Koweit. In the end he suggested the appointment of commissioners from either side to work out a compromise. This is a considerable advance on his part: what he would apparently welcome is that Koweit should make a fixed annual payment representing his share of the Koweit customs but this might be regarded as tribute by the Sheikh and therefore be unacceptable. Colonel Dickson is to ascertain whether the Sheikh would agree to a conference being held. The Resident is still anxious that Ibn Saud should be reminded of the Sheikh 1 s claims from him, amounting to Rs.14^- lakhs # It is understood that the Sheikh would waive them in return £or the raising of the 'blockade ’ 1 brtt-, although Ibn Saud could not % possibly pay at present, they might prove a useful leversMinute Paper.

But nothing can be decided till we know the attitude of the Sheikh of Minister for Foreign Affair T s hint that it was incorrect for His Ma«jesty T s Government to make representations on behalf of Koweit, at once countered by His Majesty ! s Minister, and the tension which exists in the relations between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Hamza owing to the Royal Slave incident should be noted. 214b 3000 8 31$7. Downing Street, 19th March, 1932. No. 98048/32. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to the letter (covering cover from Ool.Biscoe only) from this Department of the 2nd of March numbered as above regarding the recent visit of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to His Majesty King Ibn Saud at Hasa and to transnit to you to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare a copy of a telegram from the Resident an the subject of the blockade of Kuwait. 2. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister would be glad to be furnished with the views of the Secretary of State for India on the course of action proposed by the Resident in paragraph 11 of his despatch Confidential 3 of the 5th February a copy of which accompanied the Colonial Office letter under reference and in particular on his suggestion that Fuad Hamza might be notified informally of the existence ;of the claims put forward by the Shaikh of Kuwait against Ibn Saud. 3. The attention of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is being drawn to the message of good will from Ibn Saud to His Majesty’s Government reported in paragraph 7 of the Resident’s desp&amp;ch Confidential 2 of the 5th February in case it is desired to return a suitable reply to His Majesty. 4. I am to take this opportunity to enclose a — copy of a further despatch from the Political Resident covering a translation of letters exchanged between Yusuf Yasin and himself as a result of his meeting with Ibn/73 \ Ibn Saud, 5. So far as Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is aware, no proposal for a loan to Ibn Saud has been xeceived or entertained, though his attention has been drawn to the Press report to which Colonel Biscoe refers. 6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is being asked to furnish his observations on the course of action proposed by the Political Resident and a copy of this letter with the enclosure is being sent to the Mr Ministry.

That no visa fees should be charged in tne case of hejd subjects travelling from hejd port® to Kuwait and Bahrain or between Kuwait and Bahrain, eitiier at their entry or at their exist. Similarly Bahrain and Kuwait subjects saould enter our ?om in thr= ;ulf t without paying any fee for visas on their pasenorte other (one anna) at the entry and halfuQsiinahI.Amiri than naif Ciursh Amiri/at the exit,, it being value of the stamp affixed on tn- visa. 2. That our subjects who travel to India from he jd, will not be cr.arged more than a rupee at their entry and exit for visa, on theiron their passport©. As regards the Indian subjects, Bunniafts will be permitted to eater qatif temporarily, not for permanent residence for a period not exceeding two months on each occasion, method of granting permission to be the same as formerly* And Moslem Indians are permitted to enter our ports in the Gulf for the purpose of trade only, and one rupee will be recovered from each# If any of the parties wish a modification in this, he should inform the other party about hie desire, so that agreement may be arrived at. 1 request that those of our subjects in Bahrain, wno do not possess passports, but who wish to travel to India, or to foreign countries, should not be supplied travel permits at Bahrain, but should be called upon to obtain passports from their country of origin and we snail make special arrangements to expedite the completion of their passports. 1 request iour Excellency to recomend that our subjects in Bahrain should be well treated, and their rights guarded. I request that you will undertake the necessary negotiations to open wireless communications with Bahrain, and to fix moderate rates so as to encourage the expansion of trade and improve the relations between the two countries. I await the proposals wnicu you will make regarding ani 8. 9. 10 . 11 . an agreement for the surrender of crlmiuels ^jLh between Bargain and ; ejd. I re'iuest you to make arrarigements for exchange of malls between bejd and Bahrain and for tnelr despatch from ! anrajn to their destinations. 1 re'iuest that efforts be made to arrange that commercial boats plying between our coasts in the Gulf and the Bahrain coast, should carry manifests for the cargo on board. 1 request that efforts be made to arrange for exchange of judicial summonses between be.brain and i ejd through the Amirs of places in our lands and through the Shaikhs of Bahrain in Banrain. As regards the discussions that took place about permitting our subjects to trade at Kuwait, we see no objection to a meeting of representatives of our Government and representatives of the Kuwait Government, at Kuwait, Bahrain or iiasa to discuss this matter to consider how interests of both parties may be protected.

Colonel Biecoe has explained the matter to the King who has, I understand, rescinded u ls previous order but I should like myself as well to draw the attention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to it so that there may be no room for misunderstanding* ^he language I used referred of course only to frontier officers and persons subordinate to them engaged in enterprises of the kind mentioned in the earlier part of my Bote* Subjects of uis Majesty entering Kuwait in a regular manner for legitimate purposes are very welcome* I heard late# yesterday that 'our Excellency had unexpectedly His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza% 12 b V Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— : £ Subject • Oh. 4 Reference to previous correspondence: ^rC.

In addition, the volume contains copies of India Office correspondence with both the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office, as well as copies of correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Vincent Biscoe) and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.The beginning of the volume concerns a request made by Ibn Saud to use the occasion of a meeting with King Faisal [Fayṣal bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī] of Iraq to open formal negotiations with the British regarding general questions relating to the Persian Gulf.The British response is that a meeting of this kind, at such short notice, would not be possible; however, proposals are made for a meeting between Ibn Saud and the Political Resident at a later date. Such a meeting, it is suggested, could also be attended by the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir as Subah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ], for the purpose of discussing Nejd-Kuwait relations. Much of the correspondence discusses the efforts made by the British to arrange the proposed meeting with Ibn Saud (which would eventually take place at Hasa in January 1932). The volume includes a report from Biscoe recounting his meetings with both Ibn Saud and his representative, which include the following subjects of discussion: the Kuwait blockade; passport facilities for persons from Nejd travelling to India or Iraq; the possibility of consular status being afforded to representatives of Nejd in Bahrain and Kuwait; the possibility of an extradition treaty between Bahrain and Nejd.Also included in the volume are copies of letters and intelligence summaries from the Political Agent at Kuwait (Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson) to the Political Resident.The volume's other prominent correspondents include the following: the British Consul (later His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires) at Jedda, (William Linskill Bond, succeeded by Cecil Gervase Hope Gill); the British Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd [Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd; also held in an acting capacity by Fuad Bey Hamza]; Ibn Saud; the Ruler of Kuwait.The volume includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Nejd</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00025c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
