SHARJAH 31st March, 19 40 Dear Mr. Weightman, This is to remind you of .our conversaLWn regarding the question of Bond facilities for liquor stocks. As you are, no doubt, aware, the California Araoian Standard Oil Company's employees have now been granted a Liquor Licence, and there is likely to be a large demand for various descriptions of liquor. Unless we can offer them some inducement, they are likely to import direct from America into Arabia through the port of Ras Tanura. advantage to grant us this Bonding facility, as they would then, on our shipping liquor to Arabia, receive the usual transhipment I shall be glad to have your views on this subject and I consider it would be to the Bahrein Government's duty possibly, your assistance in attaining this object Yours sincerely, H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., BAHREIN.Confidential No. C/264 Dated the 31st March 1940 Smith of Grey Mackenzie was speaking to me the other day about the possibility of providing bond facilities for liquor stocks in Bahrain, from which they could supply the California Arabia Company now that the latter have a liquor permit. 2. I would most strongly recommend that the Bahrain Government should give sympathetic consideration to such a proposal* In the first place it will mean that the mainland Company will import British spirits and beers via Bahrain instead of getting American liquor direct from the TJ.3.A. to Has Tanura. The ouantity is liable # to be considerable and it would be a good thing if we could ensure that the trade goes to Britain. In the second place I think it would be profitable to the Bahrain Government who would receive the usual transhipment or re-export duty on everything being exported in bond from Bahrain to Arabia. There x will be no bonds* substantial difficulties in arranging for a/warehouse, which might well be in Gray Mackenzie* s own compound, and if you are favourable towards the proposal I will get 3mith to put in formal proposals. 3. I should be grateful for an early reply. Yours sincerely, C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Ssq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government,[iV^I \ i 4 Dear Weightman, Reference your D.O.No. C/264 dated 31st March 1940. I have discussed the matter with the Shaikhs who are averse to making any special concession in favour of Gray, Mackenzie 1 s liquor imports for Mainland. I have also discussed the question with deGrenier and I am inclined to think that an extension of the optional system, which is now 20 days, to a longer period would facilitate trade in general and would not he disadvantageous to the Government. This would enable Gray, Mackenzie to keep their stock here for longer before reshipping to Arabia and if the rule was applied generally no suggestion of partiality could be made. Regarding the points in your letter, as all the non Asiatic employees on the Mainland are Americans I think it is likely that they will in any case import American liquors for which they seem to have a preference. If a special arrangement was made in the case of Gray, Mackenzie I am of the opinion that other general merchants would demand similar facilities for other goods. Yours sincerely, H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., H. B.

Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Shipping Agents, had a license from the Government of Bahrain to act as a Landing Company for loading and discharging goods % from steamers in the Bahrain ports. The Landing Company is authorised to collect fees according to a fixed tariff, which has on various occasions been revised sometimes by introducing increased rates, sometimes by reductions. The Company pays a royalty of 5$ to the Bahrain Government on the landing charges collected by it. The Agreement is subject to renewal every five years. I enclose a copy of a letter recently received from the Manager of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co. I discussed the question with His Highness Shaikh Salman who approved of renewing the Agreement for a further five years but wished me to obtain your views upon the question of increas ing the landing charges. His Highness pointed out that the Company is a foreign Company and in fact most of the mer- chants who would be affected by a charge in rates are also foreigners, therefore he refrained from agreeing to any increase until your views had been obtained. His Highness appreciates the fact that the expenses of the Landing Company have increased considerably since the war began but he thinks that any increase in the tariff would be by many of the local merchants. Adviser to the Government. S.Z.Copy of a letter No. L/346 dated the 9th May 1942, from Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company Limited, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. LANDING AGREEMENT. We would refer to your letter No. 418/SF of 1356 (26th May, 1937), advising that the Landing Agree ment we have with the Bahrein Government had been ex tended upto 13th May, 1942. We now request that this agreement, subject to the approval of the Bahrein Government, be extended for a further period of five years, commencing as from 14th May, 1942. If the Government is prepared to grant this extension, on the same terms and conditions as previously, we suggest that the existing rates be increased by 25% to meet the heavy increase in the costs of upkeep of boats, wages, etc., that have been brought about by existing war conditions. i For your information, we enclose a schedule showing landing charges at present in force and what they will amount to be if a 25% increase is sanctioned. We trust the Government will be prepared to grant us a new Landing Agreement, with the increase in charges as suggested. S.Z.it© No.C/867. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 21st June 1942.

An increase in Landing Charges is, I think, necessary to enabli the Landing Company to meet its increased costs.

Dear Prior, We were recently approached by Messrs. G-ray, Mackenzie for our assistance in securing a visa for Bahrein at very short notice for a Mr. Steele, a wharf superintendent whom the Isthmian Line (whoso agents Gray, Mackenzie are) wished to send out from the U.S.A. to Bahrein and thence on to Has Tanura for advisory and general supervisory purposes in connection with the large quantities of material which are in the course of shipment from the U.S.A. to . Ras Tanura for the refinery construction work there. The normal procedure would, of course, have been for us to telegraph to you enquiring whether you saw any objection to the issue of a visa, but since this procedure would probably have meant Mr. Steele missing his plane reservation, we asked the Passport Control Department to authorise the grant of a visa forthwith. Incidentally, we understand that Gray, Mackenzie arc much concerned at the difficulties v/hich they arc having in performing the services required of them by the Isthmian Line, and the latter have apparently complained of the inadequacy of their supervision in the discharge of cargo at Bahrein and Ras Tanura. Gray,- Mackenzie are apprehensive that the Americans may set up an organisation of their own in the Persian Gulf to handle their ships proceeding there, and recently applied to the Military authorities for the release of certain of their personnel from the Army to supplement their European staff.

Many members of The Bahrain General Merchants* association complain that in almost every shipment from abroad most of their packages land in broken condition due to rough handling and bad stowage by the steamer agents of this port. No care whatsoever is being takkn in discharging the packages from the barges to the custom 1 s pier and fragile and special cargo is mixed up with the heavy packages. The words on the packages ' Handle with care' and 'This side up' have no meaning. Many packages thus land in broken and defective condition with the contents pilfered and damaged. The extent of damage can be judged from the following facts Messrs. 3. DOrabjee &amp; Son ,one of the members of the association, received a consignment of 25 radio sets from England per s.s. 'Reaveley which arrived here during the last week of June and out of these 25 sets 17 sets were received by them'^he dial- glass broken and a further set with damagd to casing and loudepealrS speaker. From their second consignment of 13 sets per s.s. 'Gorjistan“ which just lately arrived 5 sets out of 7 are received with the dial glass broken and from further six sets which have unbreakable glass one set is received withdamage to casing, ^s far as I understand the radios are given a special stowage in the steamer and the damage must have taken place here due to the negligence of the people responsible for unloading the cargo. On behalf of the members of the B.G.M.a. I request you to lock into this matter and instruct the steamer agents of this port to handle the carg4 carefully.

As you are aware, as agreed by you, I am going into the question of taking over the discharge of all cargo onto Manamah pier from Messrs Gray Mackenzie’s contractors, but have so far been unable to agree discharge rates. As soon as I do, 1 will put this into operation and advise you. NV, Confidential. Bahrain receipt. ****######*Li&lt;l D.O. No• c/992 Dated the 4th September, 1946 Dear Meikle, I have received a complaint from the Bahrain General Merchants' Association that the.greater part of the packages in most of their shipments from abroad are landed in a damaged condition due to rough handling and bad stowage, and that no differentiation is made when discharging cargo between fragile and special cargo and heavy packages* 2. They give as instances a consignment of English radio sets shipped by the S.S. 'Reaveley' to Messrs. S. Dorabjee and Sons, in which 17 out of 25 sets were received in a damaged condition, and another 13 sets shipped by the S*S* 'Gorjistan' to the same firm, of which 6 were received damaged. I understand that the Bahrain Government had a similar cause of comDlaint recently when a consignment of refrigerators was man handled and rolled across the pier instead of being moved by crane. ^ I should be grateful for your comments, with particular reference to how far it is possible to arrange at present for increased supervision by Euro pean staff of the loading and unloading of cargo at this port.

C/992 of the 4th instant in regard to the complaint from the General Mercnahts 1 Association, I shall be obliged if you will kindly convey to the association our assurance that it is our earnest desire that consignees should receive their cargo in the best possible condition. You quote two instances when cargo was said to have been badly handled but, as the ss. ’’Reaveley” arrived on 25th June, it is impossible for me now to comment on Mr. Dhorabjee T s complaint regarding his radio sets at this late date. If consignees would refer to us at the time we should be only too glad to look into any complaints there and then* As regards refrigerators my attention was drawn to their handling on the pier at the time and I immediately took steps to have the matter put right. I think you will agree, however, that the facilities for offloading cargo of this nature leaves much to be desired. There is only one crane on the Customs pier at Manama —a very slow working hand crane- and it so happens that the quay at the crane is not very suitable for barges as there are several large stones jutting out from the pier at that particu lar place. I realise of course that it is extremely difficult at the present time to get new equipment and I believe the Customs did ask for quotations for cranes but were told delivery could not be given within less than two years. I am reminding supervisors on ships that cargo must be handled carefully at the time of discharge and given good stowage in barges. A European member of our staff visits ships at Sitra daily and he is being asked to give this matter his best attention. I am also instructing supervisors on the Customs pier to ensure that cargo is carefully handled at the time of discharge there and the Assistant in Charge of the Shipping Department will vidfc the pier regularly to see that these instructions are being carried out.

Dear Sir, ^ The other day the writer had an interview with Captain Ranee when we referred to a letter we have received from Bombay Agents regarding the heavy losses sustained by the Landing Company in recent years. Bombay agents advise that they have been in consultation with Managing Agents and consider that the current rates for landing charges should be increased with the least possible delay. They suggest that to cover actual costs, depreciation, maintenance and to allow a reasonable profit, it will be necessary to increase current rates by 100 to 15056, and they ask us to consult you in this regard and to advise them by telegram what the reaction of the Bahrein Government will be to a request for permission to increase the landing charges. Captain Ranee explained that before he could consider the matter he would require a comparative statement showing the cost of wages and materials today as compared with 1939® We have now been able to extract the information you require and attach hereto a statement which we trust will give you some idea as to the increased cost of operating the Landing Company and explain the heavy losses referred to by Bombay. Landing charges were increased in 1942 by 2056 but, as can be seen, that increase is not nearly sufficient to compensate for the increased operational costs, and we therefore trust you will support a further increase as suggested by Bombay. Bahrein, 6th October, As the matter is of considerable urgency and we have been asked by Bombay to telegraph at the earliest possible date, we shall be obliged if you will give this matter your early consideration. Should you wish to discuss the matter further, we shall be pleased to rail on you at your convenience. Yours faithfully, BA HR '■ ' r iROEIPT. N© L'T 37 • (o * £* 4 -&lt; AGENTS.CONFIDENTIAL D.O. No.C/1139 The 9th of October, 1946 Dear Belgrave, Meikle came to see me on the 28th of ‘September and showed me a letter he had received from his Company’s Bombay agents on the subject of the ’’heavy losses sustained by the landing company in recent years”. The Bombay agents consider that the current rates of landing charges should be increased with the least possible delay, and suggest that to cover actual costs, depreciation, maintenance and to allow a reasonable profit, it would be necessary to' increase the current rates by 100 to 150 percent. According to figures produced by the Bombay agents the landing company had sustained a loss amounting to just under one lakh of rupees during the three years ending 31st January, 1946. 2. Meikle asked what my views were on the proposal to increase rates of landing charges. I replied that before giving him a definite reply I should like to see some detailed figures showing the necessity for the proposed Increases, but I told him that I considered that increased rates at this time would not be at all popular locally particularly In view of the fact that there have been several more complaints recently of the way in which the Landing Company handles packages coming ashore at Manama. 3. As you will remember, the landing charges were increased in 1942 by 20 percent, but the company now allege that that increase is not nearly sufficient to compensate for the present increased operational costs, and in support of this argument Meikle has sent me a statement showing the comparative costs of wages and materials for the years 1939 and 1946. I enclose a copy of this statement and also a copy of the schedule of the present landing charges and would be grateful if you will let me have the Bahrain Government’s views at a very early date as I am anxious to take the matter up with the Political Resident as early as possible.

Adviserate, October 22, 1946 With reference to your D.O.No. C/1139 dated 9th October 1946, I am sending four copies of the Landing Agreement• 2. The question of landing charges was discussed between His Highness, Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa and myself on Saturday. We realise that the additional 20# on the charges which His Highness sanctioned in 1942 does not cover the present increased costs of landing cargo and His Highness is willing to approve of a further small increase in the charges. He is not however willing to increase the charges to the extent which the company’s Bombay agents demand and before doing anything he wishes to discuss the matter with representatives of the local merchants. 3. At times, in the past, when changes were made in the Landing Company’s Agreement the Bahrain merchants were consulted. If this is done now I am quite sure that they will strongly appose any substantial increase in the charges and I think it is possible that they will revive the suggestion that other means should be adopted for landing cargo. At various times the merchants have talked of starting a local landing company similar to that which exists or used to exist in Kuwait. I think myself that this would be unsatisfactory but as some of the merchants are dissatisfied with the Landing Company and many of them possess plenty of capital the arguments in favour of starting a local landing company may be stronger today than they were in the past. There is no actual monopoly for landing cargo, at one time three firms in Bahrai n held licenses for the landing of cargo from different shipping lines. 4. At present it is the Bahrain Government and the general public which would be most affected by an increase in the rates because,as you knoW/inost of the food supply of the country is being bought and imported by the Bahrain Government. A considerable increase in landing rates would be reflected in the cost of provi sions and would increase the cost of living. 5. While His Highness is willing to allow some increase in charges he feels that it is not reasonable for the Company to demand what appears to him an excessive increase. If it is the case that they have suffered losses over the last three years there is reason to believe that they have made considerable profits during the many years that they have held what has practically become a monopoly for landing cargo.

In this connection I should add that Meikle has admitted to me in conversation that most of the landing craft and equipment now in use old and uneconomical to operate, and I consider that the Company would effect a considerable saving in their present operational costs if they bought new landing craft and equip ment.

You may add that Colonel Hay is of opinion that to reach such an agreement should not be difficult since, as reported in Bahrain Agency express letter first referred to, only the charges at Manama are likely to raise questions of their reasonableness etc., it being obvious that those at Sitra must be higher than those at Manama for goods to be unloaded ultimately at the latter place. , C\ 2.

Our proposals, which were submitted by me to His Highness, are as follows 1. The existing cumbersome list of commodities with special rates for each commodity shall no longer be used. 2. There shall be a fixed rate of charges for all bag cargo and all case cargo. 3. Bag cargo will be charged at the rate of Hs.5/- per ton am case cargo will be charged at the rate of Rs.7/8/- per ton. This represents an increase of 66$ on bag cargo and £0$ on case cargo. The new rate of charges shall be liable to reduction when the Government is satisfied that labour costs and the cost of upkeep of the landing Company’s fleet of dhows has definitely decreased. His Highness now approved of these recommendations and I propose to communicate them to the Manager of Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company by letter and to the public by means of a circular.

Memorandum:- On Tuesday 8th April Eis Eighness presided over a meeting at the Manama Municipality which was attended by about thirty of the leading Bahrain merchants, Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, Mr. G.W.R. Smith and myself were also present. 2. Eis Eighness informed the meeting that he had called them together to discuss the Landing Company, whore license would shortly terminate, owing to the numerous complaints which had been made to him and to his Government about the unsatisfactory treatment of cargo. Ee said that his Government wished to help the merchants and had asked them to meet together in order to hear what they had to say. A number of different merchants then produced specific complaints raising the following points a. Cargo from steamers at Sitra took in some cases two weeks to be conveyed by sea from Sitra to Manama due to the Landing Company keeping barges at Sitra until they were fully loaded which meant that they often waited at Sitra for two steamers to arrive there before returning to Manama. b. Pilferage was excessive; the merchants stated that not only coolies and Nakhudas were involved in pilferage but tally clerks and supervisors who were the only people who had knowledge of the contents of the cases which were opened, the cases which were opened and pilfered usually contained goods which could easily be sold. Confidential. BAHRAIN' RECEIPT. T*!l 3 PFJ U0 3 Daito.. •••••* •H nvaV 2 c. The insurance rates against pilferage had increased owing to the insecure conditions of cargo in transit between Sitra and Manama. They stated that in Kuwait pilferage was very infrequent. d persons of known dishonest characters were employed by the Landing Company, they also complained that there was no supervision by the Company over cargo . lying in barges off Sitra and that there was every opportunity for people to steal from the boats. 3. There followed a long and rather confused discussion in which a number of people took part, about the desirability and possibility of the Bahrain merchants organising themselves a Landing Company on the lines of the one in Kuwait. Some wished the Bahrain Government to undertake this or to share in it. His Highness said very definitely that he did not approve of this suggestion but that c jOf the merchants produced concrete proposals for forming a Company among themselves he would give the matter consideration. 4. The existing Agreement was read to the meeting and discussed at length. The merchants then asked for copies of the Agreement in English and Arabic and asked for permission to hold another meeting in the Baladiya on Saturday 12th April. 5. My own impression of the result of the meeting was that the merchants thought it unlikely that they could come to any agreement among themselves but at the same time they favoured very strongly the setting up of a new organisation. Personal and commercial jealousies were very apparent during the discussion, when, for instance, someone suggested that one of the Hindu merchants should act as Secretary at the later meeting several of the Moslem merchants showed strong disapproval.

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum;- I enclose a copy of a letter from the Manager, Gray Mackenzie and my reply to it. 2. The volume of complaints by the local merchants to His Highness about pilferage and delay has been steadily increasing and there is no doubt whatever that very large quantities of goods are being stolen from the barges and boats between steamer and shore. 3. During the last few weeks the Police have arrested several people for being implicated in thefts from cargo, in one case electric torches fromU.S.A., consigned to a local merchant, were on sale in the bazaar before he received his goods from the customs. When he did receive them it was found that a case had been opened and a quantity of torches were missing. In another instance piece goods from England of a distinctive type were missing from a shipment. The identical material is said to be on sale in Doha at about a quarter of its cost price. In another case one of Gray Mackenzie Nakhudas was convicted by the Bahrain Court of being in possession of a quantity of shoes, headclothe etc., which were missing from cargo belonging to a local merchant. 4. The Bahrain merchants complain incessantly to the Bahrain Government and to His Highness himself about the state^of things and His Highness has called a meeting of^lending importers next Tuesday in order to hear what they have to say. Should they propose to start a new Landing Company on the lines of the one in Kuwait, which personally I consider is doubtful, His Highness would beCopy of letter No. C&amp;F/GEN/47 dated 17th March 1947, from Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company Ltd., Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. We refer to the recent alterations in the scale of landing charges to bring these charges into line with present conditions. The rates however do not include lightering cargo from Sitra anchorage where an increasing number of vessels now discharge as their craft does not permit them to discharge at Manama. We suggest that we are pennitted to make a surcharge of Rs.2/- per shipping ton over the present rates when cargo has to be lightered from Sitra. Would you kindly consider this matter.No, SSJ* of i366 Office of tko Adviaer to tne Governmont, B^lirain Dated, 20th j/Awal, 1366 April 10, 1947.

In tills connoction I must point out to you that the present license from the Bahrain Govern ment under which the Landing Company operates is due to expiro on 13th May 1947. The Bahrain Government is aware that there is a great deal of discontent among tho local merchants about the amount of pilferage from cargoes for Bahrain and it is thought that much of the pilferage occurs between the steamers and the shore. The merchants also complain about the length of time taken to convey the cargo from Sitra to Manama. Before considering the question of renewing the Landing Agreement His Highness has decided to discuss the whole question of the landing of cargo with some of the leading Bahrain merchants.

Abdul Aziz al Bassam was unable to attend owing to illness. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, Mr. G.W.R. Smith and myself were present. 2. The merchants informed His Highness that they were prepared to form a Landing Compemy and to under take the duties now carried out by the present Landing Company according to the Agreement now existing. They stated that they had sufficient capital with which to purchase craft, tugs etc., from India and Egypt where they were known to be available and that they would be in a position to commence operations within six months from the time that they might be given an assurance that the Government would grant them a licence. They applied for a licence for ten years from the date of its being granted. They also asked that they should be allowed to supply the labour for unloading cargo from steamers into craft, which is not actually undertaken by the Landing Company as such but is undertaken by Gray, Mackenzie as ships* agents. They were prepared to agree to the existing rates subject to revision at a later date, according to arrangement now in force between the Government and the Landing Company. 3. The amount of capital available was at present seven lacs but more coulu be found, 4. His Highness informed the meeting that he approved of the project in a general way but would let them have his views later. When the merchants left he discussed the matter with Mr. Smith and myself and asked me to inform you about the meeting and ascertain your opinion on the matter. In the meantime the Government has not yet taken any steps to renew or to extend the agreement with tne Landing Company.f? CONFIDENTIAL POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 29th April, 1947 No.C/512 Dear Colonel Hay, please refer to the correspondence ending with my printed Letter No.C/456, dated the 12th of April, 1947, regarding the proposal of some Bahrain merchants that they should start a landing company. I now enclose a copy of a letter from the Adviser from which you will see that the scheme has got somewhat further, and in wnich the Adviser asks me my opinion. I had a long conversation with JAeikle and Gregor this morning, and it will probably be better If I recorded their observations seriatim. They were:- (i) Gray Mackenzies are definitely opposed to the scheme because they believe that a local landing company would be careless about unloading ships with expedition. Gray Mackenzies themselves are deeply interested in this aspect because they are agents of the ships' companies. (ii) The merchants' real anxiety to start a landing company is not caused by their grievances regarding pilferage, etc., but by the fact that they are convinced that Gray Mackenzies are making large profits out of the landing business. This, according to the latter, is not the case. (iii) The Kuwait example (vide paragraph 4 of Adviser's Memorandum No.1052-3SF dated the 7th April, 1947) is not applicable becaiase (a) Bahrain is a much more difficult port; in fact, it is not a port at all, but a collection of anchorages;, (b) The Kuwait Company is unable to work more than one ship at a time; and (c) The rate at Kuwait for unloading is Rs.16/- per ton while in Bahrain bag cargo is charged for at the rate of Rs.5/- per ton, and case cargo at the rate of Rs.7/8/- per ton. /(iv) when The Hon'ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.(iv) when I verbally drew Gregor’s attention to the ^ r request of the promoters of the company (vide paragraph 2 of the Adviser’s ?,!emorandum No. 1165-3. S.F. dated the 20th April, 1947) that they should be allowed to supply the labour for unloading cargo from steamers into craft, he at once stated that this was a question which, if put officially to him, he would have to refer to his principals. He added that the shipping companies would probably object to having labour doing' unloading woric in their ships other than that employed by their agents. In Kuwait, he said, the labour working in the ships was Gray ?/ackenzies. (v) Security against pilferage, although the State’s agreement with the landing company places it upon the latter, is also^responsibility of the State’s. (vi) A new landing company would be dependent on Gray MacKenzies for information as to the E.T.A. of ships. 2. My comments are as follows As regards (i) and (ii) I am inclined to think that the profit motive is the main one inspiring both parties. The points under (ill) to (vi) deserve consideration. 3. My opinion is that it is exceedingly doubtful that the projected landing company would be able to give better landing service to the merchants and general public, and while I agree that Gray Mackenzies seem to have been culpable in the pasc I think it is time that the State, which can well afford to do so, strengthened its measures against theft of cargoes. Though the capital behind the promoters seems adequate, I am doubtful of tneir ability to provide better service than that given by Gray Mackenzies, and if they do not do so, they may have shipping companies avoiding Bahrain, and the position will be a great deal worse than it Is at present. Furthermore, it seems exceedingly doubtful whether the proposed company, in view of the Kuwait rate! (though all rates are, of course, higher in Kuwait) will be able to unload as cheaply as Gray Mackenzies. If you approve, I will inform Belgrave of my views as set out in this paragraph. /4. There is-3- 4. There is another point which is important. Paragraph 3 of the licence granted to Gray Mackenzies for landing cargo s ta tes: ••That at least six calendar months before the termination of the said period of five years our (the Bahrain) Government will give notice to the Ship’s Agents in writing, of its intention to renew, terminate, or revise the Licence or any of its clauses.” The present licence is due to expire on the 13th May, and notice. Tie argued verbally that failure to do so does not make it incumbent upon the Bahrain Government to renew the licence. Meikle, however, has shown me letters from the Bahrain Government ; in previous years,informing Gray Mackenzies at the termination of the licence that as they had given no notice of intention to terminate, the licence must be assumed to be renewed. The terms of the licence are not definitive on these points. But, if Gray Mackenzies appeal to us against the decision of the Bahrain Government terminating the licence without notice,we should be bound to protest and to try and obtain a further concession for them. In addressing Belgrave as suggested^ I would, therefore, if you approve, also point out that the termination of the licence without notice would be of exceedingly doubtful legal validity. f\ Belgrave tells me that he ’’forgot” to give them six months' Yours sincerely, P NS.Confidential.

Dear Sir, We have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and note that the Government is not at present prepared to allow an increase in Landing Charges from Sitra anchorage. We ’/ere not aware that the present landing license is due to expire on the 13th proximo# Clause 3 of the License states that at leaftt six calender months before the termination of the period of the contract, the Government will give notice in writing of its intention to terminate or renew the license and as we have received no such notice we assumed that the license had been extended for a further period of five years as was the ease on a previous occasion. In this connection please see your letters of 22nd September, 1936 and 18th and 26th Hey, 1937• We are aware that merchants have complained regarding pilferage of cargo. Although pilferage may take place from time to time between ship and shore, we cannot agree that a major quantity suffers during this movement. As ultimate carriers we are in the unenviable position of having to bear the brunt of all complaints concerning the condition of cargo for delivery here, but with our knowledge of conditions at shipping ports and elsewhere, not readily available to the general public, vie can assure you that we are not always responsible for such shortages# &gt; s' On the contrary we have always considered it our duty to safeguard merchants 1 goods while in our custody, but this has proved Increasingly difficult as we have been unable to find suitable guards on whose integrity we can rely. We believe it is universally accepted that a world-wide moral deterioration is now being experienced and this, coupled with the general shortage of goods and the poor quality of containers in which goods are packed now-a-days has aggravated the difficulties of cargo transport everywhere# We have discussed this matter with merchants* representatives and the Inspector of the State Police, but nc constructive suggestions.'T U 4 DUPLICATE INVOICE MANNING, MAXWELL &amp; MOORE, INC.

BAHRAIN RECEIPT,@ Copy of letter No. l/ 113 dated 14th April 1947, from Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. We have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and note that the Government is not at present prepared to allow an increase in Landing Charges from Sitra anchorage. We were not aware that the present landing license is due to expire on the 13th proximo. Clause 3 of the License states that at least six calendar months before the termi nation of the period of the contract, the Government will give notice in writing of its intention to terminate or renew the license and as we have received no such notice we assumed that the license had been extended for a further period of five years as was the case on a previous occasion. In this connection please see your letters of 22nd September 1936 and 18th and 26th May 1937. We are aware that merchants have complained regarding pilferage of cargo. Although pilferage may take place from time to time between ship and shore, we cannot agree that a major quantity suffers during this movement. As ultimate carriers we are in the unenviable position of having to bear the brunt of all complaints concerning the condition of cargo for delivery here, but with out knowledge of conditions at shipping ports and elsewhere, not readily available to the general public, we can assure you that we are not always responsible for such shortages. On the contrary we have always considered it our duty to safeguard merchants* goods while in our custody, but this has proved increasingly difficult as we have been unable to find suitable guards on whose integrity we can rely. We believe it is universally accepted that a world-wide moral deterioration is now being experienced and this, coupled with the general shortage of goods and the ppor quality of containers in which goods are packed now-a-days has aggravated the difficulties of cargo transport everywhere. We have discussed this matter with merchants* representa tives and the Inspector of the State Police, but no const- ractive suggestions, however, have been made so far, nor has any matehial help been offered. No one appears to be able in any way to assist us in a matter which we consider con cerns the community at large, if suitable guards are available we shall be pleased to employ them in the common interest. We believe that the Government can assist considerably in the suppresion of pilferage bearing in mind that if a ready local market'for stolen goods were not available, there would be little inducement to steal. We take this opportunity of assuring you that at all times we are ready and anxious to discuss these matters with the Government and merchants and to act proomptly on any reasonable suggestions that may be made. S.Z.D.O. No.C/589 Tho 17 th of ? r ay, 1947 1 ^ Dear Belgrave, ‘ 1 Please refer to your T'emo rand urn No. 1165-3. SP. dated the 20th of April, 1947, in which you asked for my opinion on the proposal of some local' merchants to form a landing company. 2. It seems to ne exceedingly doubtful that the projected landing company would be able to give better service to the merchants and general public than do Gray -ackenzies; and though I agree that they seem to have been culpable in the past, T am inclined to believe that It is time that the Bahrain Government strengthened its measures against theft of cargoes. After all, security is a state responsibility in any country -in the world, and cannot be forced entirely upon a private company. Though the capital behind the promoters seems to be adequate, there is the risk that their service will be less efficient than Gray rackenzies’ and if it is not as good they may have shipping companies avoiding Bahrain and the position will be greatly worse than it is at present. Furthermore, will the proposed company be able to unload as cheaply as Gray rackenzios* ] / 3. There is another point which seems to me to be very important. I refer to that raised by Gray Mackenzie's letter a copy of which you sent me with your printed Letter No. 1284-3.SF. dated the 5th ? T ay, 1947. The terms of the licence for unloading granted to Gray Mackenzies are not definitive as to the effects of failing to give notice to renew, terminate or revise as the case may be; but, neverthe less, its termination without notice would be of exceedingly doubtful legal validity.

Dear Colonel Hay, I enclose for your information a copy of my record of the proceedings of a meeting held on Thursday, the 29th May, about the proposed landing company to be formed by the Manama merchants. 2. When Belgrave suggested the meeting I refrained from pressing him to define its object. This, I think, was just as well because the main idea of the merchants was to talk. They did not intend to present Gray Mackenzies with an ultimatum. However, I think that the meeting may have done some good in giving the merchants an opportunity to air their grievances, and perhaps inspiring Gray Mackenzies to do something towards removing them. Something further may emerge after the meeting tomorrow, but I should be surprised if the proposed landing company ever really gets going. This is not an altogether welcome conclusion because Gray Mackenzies are, of course, well aware of the position and thus escape the fear of competition. Yours sincerely Policical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain NS.(\ou On the 27th of May, Mr.Belgrave came to see me and said that the merchants promoting the landing company wanted to have a meeting with the representatives of Messrs* Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., at which the Shaikh and I would be present. I said that I was willing to attend, but that if they wanted M/s. Gray Mackenzies they should approach them themselves. Mr. Belgrave said that his own offices were too small for a meeting, and I offered my Court room. The meeting was held there on Thursday, the 29th of May, at 10 0* clock and lasted for nearly two hours and a half. The following were present:- His Highness Shaikh Salman. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa A1 Khalifa. Mr. C.D. Belgrave (Adviser to the Bahrain Govt.) Mr. G.W.R. Smith (Director of Customs) Mr. W. Meikle (Gray Mackenzies) Mr. J.E. Allcard ( rt ) Abdul Aziz A1 Qosaibi. Ahmad Fakhroo. Khalil Kanoo. Hussain Yateem.. Kakoomal Valabdas. Akbar Ali Reza. 2. Proceedings started with a number of merchants stating at great length their opinion that pilfering of cargoes was done by the coolies who actually unloaded the ships, the implication being that if they started a new landing company they should be allowed to supply their own coolies. Mr. Meikle reacted as soon as he could get a word in by stating that he N had understood that the meeting had been called to discuss the landing of cargo from ship to shore, and not to deal with the actual 'working'* of ships — a subject, he implied, about which he was not prepared to treat. Mr. Belgrave supported him by pointing out that the discussion about the work in the ships was a side issue. /A lot.- 2 - 3. A lot of discussion then ensued, the burden of which was that unloading from sitra is unsatisfactory. There are, it was alleged, great delays. Half-loaded barges from one ship are sometimes kept at Sitra to be filled from another arriving later. Many days are taken in moving the loaded barges from Sitra to the Manama Customs. In addition to the delays, thefts occur 6n the way. All cargoes for Manama should be unloaded at the Manama anchorage. This last point received the Shaikh's very strong support. . the 4. As regards the delays Mr. Meikle said that^Muharraq bridge was often kept closed against his barges. He asked for more protection from the Bahrain Government from thefts, and said that if the receivers of stolen goods were apprehended and prosecuted there would be no incentive to theft. 5. Mr. Kakoomal Valabdas stated (as did the Shaikh - several times) that the assembled merchants wished not to compete but to co-operate with Messrs. Gray Mackenzies. Mr. Meikle expressed gratitude for this sentiment and said that he was always ready to listen to complaints and anxious to remedy them and grateful for any suggestions for improving the service given by his firm. Mr. Kakoomal Valabdas said that he did not want to trouble the authorities - the Political Agent and the Shaikh - any further, and that the merchants and Messrs. Gray Mackenzies should have a meeting to resolve the former's difficulties. Khalil Kanoo stated that there were three things required by the merchants, that is about which they have to complain: (i) they wanted protection for their cargoes; (ii) they wanted them unloaded and brought to Manama with expedition; and (iii) they wanted reduction in the rates. /He askedHe asked why thefts occurred now which had not occurred in the past. Mr. Meikle suggested that one of the reasons for the thefts and one of their difficulties in dealing with cargoes nowadays was the poor quality of containers in which cargoes are now received as compared with that used before the war, e.g. single, poor quality^ gunny bags for grain. He said that no ship with a draught of 22 ft. was willing to use the Manama anchorage, particularly in view of S.N.O.P.G.*s having animadverted one master^ having done so whose ship drew 27 feet. 6 . The Shaikh.said that all these difficulties had resulted from ships using Sitra anchorage instead of the chief and established anchorage for Manama. Mr. Meikle said that he would write to the shipping firms asking them to direct their captains to use the Manama anchorage but would be glad of a letter from the Bahrain Government asking him to do so. The Shaikh agreed to give him the letter. 7. Mr. Meikle said that instead of being able to reduce the rates for unloading at Sitra, he felt that because of the longer carry from there, there should be an increase in rates. The political Agent pointed out that the merchants could hardly be expected to accept an increase in rates for unloading at an anchorage of which they thoroughly dis approved. 8 . Some discussion between the merchants and Messrs. Meikle and Allcard then followed regarding alleged delays in payment of insurance rates and claims against Lloyds. /9. The Shaikh....-4- 9, The Shaikh said that some decision ought to be come to in order that the Bahrain Government should know whether they would renew Messrs. Gray Mackenzie*s licence or not. The merchants then v suggested a further meeting with Messrs. Gray Mackenzies on Sunday, the first of June. The Shaikh said that it would be better if they came to some agreement with Messrs. Gray Mackenzies.

Mr. Hussain Yateem, on behalf of the merchants present, informed the meeting, that subject to acceptance by Messrs Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co.,Ltd., of the following five terms, they, the merchants, would withdraw their application to the Bahrain Government, for permission to land all cargo. No.l. Was that speedy delivery of cargo between ship and Customs be effected. No.2. Every care be taken of cargo whilst in Gray Mackenzie^ charge. No.3. That all vessels carrying local merchants cargo to discharge at Manamah. No.4. That there should be a reduction in the existing scale of Landing Charges of 20$. No.5* The merchants would request the Bahrain Government to review scale of Landing Charges yearly. To items 1 and' 2 Mr. Meikle agreed and informed the meeting that arrangements were already in hand to speed up delivery of cargo and to see that every possible protection was afforded. As regards item 3, Mr.Meikle pointed out that this was a matter on which he could not give an outright decision as this would have to be taken up with shipowners. Mr.Smith suggested that shipowners be requested to stow local cargo in such a way, that vessels could, after discharging Oil Company^ cargo at Sitrah, proceed as far into Manamah anchorage as safe navigation permitted. Mr.Meikle advised that as regards stowage, he had already taken that point up previously, pointing out that it was in the vessels own interests for speedy discharge, to have BAPCO, PLC, JIRAMCO, and local cargoes all stowed separately and easily accessible. Je confirmed his willingness to request owners to send their vessels to Manamah anchorage. The merchants agreed to his assurances. On item No.4, Mr. Meikle said he still considered the Landing rates inadequate but agreed he might make some reduction in the rates for Manamah, provided he obtained a further increase in the rates for cargo landed at Sitrah • At this point Mr.Smith pointed out that he did not think the Bahrain Government would agree to an increase in the rates from Sitrah, but would press for vessels to discharge at Manamah# Mr. Meikle then said he efumet agree to the proposed reduction of 20$• • • •2 - In order to prevent a deadlock, Khan Bahadur Gosaibi, proposed that the 20$ reduction should cargo landed at Manamah anchorage, cargo landed on the existing rates* Abdulaziz only apply to at Sitrah to remain The remaining merchants agreed to this, and after a discussion Mr.Meikle counter proposed a reduction of 15% on cargoes landed ex vessels anchored at Manamah* After a discussion and on the recommendation of Mr *Smith, the merchants accepted this reduction* Mr. Meikle agreed to item No.5, that rates be reviewed at the end of each year* The merchants then announced they would withdraw the application to land cargo, but requested that they be allowed meet Mr. Meikle of Gray, Mackenzie in the Director of Customs and Port Officer^ office, on the 1st Sunday of every month to discuss any grievances they may have etc, and to this Mr .Meikle agreed.

Isc.•• ****’’) (m) Extract of Minutes of meeting which was held at the Customs Mouse at 10 a.m. on Sunday the 6th June, 1348e •» a letter from Messrs. Gray Mackenzie, and Messrs Yusuf Kanoo &amp; Co. was then read and discussed. These two Landing Companies app -3? applied for a revision of the Landing Coy*s rates. Last June they reduced landing rates on cargo from steamers in Manama harbour hv 15 Mr. Brown stated that the landing company had. los^ a lakh of rupees during the last 12 months and could not continue to lose money at this rate. He also informed those present that on last Mrach the Landing Coy which was previously owned hythe B I Coy had nou&gt; been taken over by Gray Mackenzie, a smaller . concern which could not afford to work at a loss. He pointed out that landing conditions were difficult and that more cargo was being brought to Bahrain than the facilities of the port an_. the Landing Company could easily cope with. The merchants complain d about abe* slowness in conveying cargo from oitra to Manama. ^hey said that in some cases ca£go took 14 days between ^itra to Manama. They aa4a**ha**ii&amp; agreed that for about 8 months after . the 1st Junef 1947, there was a' great improvement in landing cargo, less delay and little pilfering but they were unanimous in stating that during the last 4 months conditions had become worse iHan before. Various cases were referred to. The merchants asked thct z the conditions which Gray Mackenzie had agreed to at the meeting o x the 1st June, 1947, should be carried out, that delivery of cargoes should be expedited, more care should be taken to preven* pilfering and that steamers with cargo for Manama should discharge^a ; ianama. They blamed the local' staff, nakhudas and boatmen, for pilierrlng and said that men dismissed for dishonesty had been re-employed and that this contributed to the present state of affairs. Mr. Brown attributed much of the reason fordelay to the fact •f-tno t Shaikh Hamad Bridge only opened once a day and once by night. Hp also spoke of the shortage of landing craft and the necessity of -unloading steamers immediately to avoid costly demurrage iees. The merchants did not agree with this argument and more local craft could be hired. Mr. Brown explained that this could only be done by raising the fees as lire of local craft was so Mpb The merchants referred to the meeting of 1st June 194/ when the prelect of a local landing Company being formed was abandoned Wau-e, they implied, Messrs. Gray Maakenzie agreed to . . -h in their system. They contended that these improvements ^r^en evidenf fo? ^months bu/during the last-four months conditions had become worse than before June 194/. Finally it was agreed that the rates on landing cargo fd)om steamers at’Manama should revert to what they were before June 1947, which was an increase of 15^ over present day rates. The possibility of Police supervision on landing craft between Sitra and ifenama was discussed, the Adviser stated that the Bahrain Government did not hold itself responsiblefdr guarding cargo in charge of the Landing Company on the Company*s boats, but it might be possible to experiment with some Police guards on some of the craft. •No. / 7 J 3S' of 1367 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 17th 3haaban,1367 June 23, 1948. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sirs, *Vith reference to your letter No.L/183 dated 7th June 1948, on the subject of Landing Charges. It is realised that the quantity of cargo now arriving in Bahrain puts a strain on the somewhat limited landing and port facilities which now exist. With regard to pilferage, I have studied the record enclosed in your letter but it is dif ficult to appreciate from the figures how much pilferage took place because in many instances merchants have complained after they have opened their cases. I do not think they would have been so unanimous in stating that for about eight months, from June 1947, conditions improved very greatly, but deteriorated during the last four months, had the fact not been true. 2. Regarding your suggestion that Police guards might be placed on board barges, for an experimental period, this proposal raises various questions. Before going further into this matter I should like to know about how many barges at one time would require guards and approximately how long theguards would have to remain on board the barges? The police are not up to full strength at present and we are somewhat short of men. 10 /. 7. V* '3. Within a week or two we propose to set up a small Police post at the end of the old Sitra pier consisting of halfa dozen men who will be provided with a launch to enable them to patrol the vicinity of the Sitra anchorage, with the objection of catching smugglers and pilferers. 4 # I cannot agree with your suggestion that the Shaikh Earned Bridge should be opened three or four times between sunrise and sunset. The bridge was built with the primary object of faci litating road trffic between the two towns and to close it frequently against road traffic would greatly reduce its usefulness. I do not think that the delay of barges at the bridge at night time provides any better opportunities for pil ferage than the opportunities which arise during the slow progress of the barges from Sitra to the bridge and frequently the barges spend several nights on their way. If the delay is mainly due to the bridge would it not be better for the barges to come round the outside of Muharraq to Manama? 5. Regarding Police records of crews, I have now instructed the Superintendent, State Police, to inform you if it comes to his knowledge that men with known bad records are employed as crew. 6 . I have informed the merchants who attended the recent meeting that you have now received information that Kuwait Landing Company rates are higher thanthose in Bahrain./ * 7 . I understand thet, ae^asreed at tfee meeting, you are prepared to continue to undertake landing work at the rates originally agreed upon in February bagged cargo .^the rates which were settled at the subsequent meeting in June 1947 and I note that if, at the end of this year, you find that you are still working at a loss you will ask the Bahrain Oovernment to sanction a further increase. 8 . On the subject of your last two paragraphs, referring to inadequate facilities at Manama Customs wharf, I would point out that the Government has improved the facilities very considerably during the last 18 months by erecting new sheds on the customs pier which make it no longer necessary to convey cargo into a shed inside the town for storage. The Government has on order a new powerful crane, on rails, but it does not at present propose a further extension of the pier. Adviser to the GovernmentCopy of a letter No.L/183 dated 7th Juhe 1948, from Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. LANDING CHARGES - Bahrain. We wish to express our thanks to you for your presence at the meeting held on 6th instant at the Customs House, when a discussion took place between local merchants, the Director of Customs and ourselves, in regard to the revision of the present scale of landing charges on cargo discharged from ships calling at Manama anchorage. We wish to take this opportunity of assuring you that we share the concern expressed by you, and the local merchants, at the delay which at times occurs in the delivery of cargo from ships discharging at sitra, and to the incidence of pilferage during transit between Sitra and Manama Customs House. On the subject or delay in delivery, as we explained at the meeting, the main cause is abnormally heavy tonnages arriving here from U.K. or America, which are often in excess of the handling tacilities of the port. By this we mean that where several ships arrive at Sitra from the u.K. or America within a few days of one another, the heavy cargoes they carry cannot always immediately be barged from sitra to Manama. We trust you will appreciate that these are circum- staxices over which we, as responsible for landing, have no e control. We have asked our Steamers» Principals in U.K. and America to endeavour to arrange that ships» arrivals here should be staggered in such a way as to avoid congestion, but we understood from them that this is a matter which is most difficult to arrange. As regards pilferage, we wish to confirm that we are prepared to take all reasonable steps which you or the merchants can suggest to prevent theft of cargoes between ship ana shore. At the meeting it was suggested that pillerage had greatly increased in rocent months, and we have now gone through our ships* records and attach hereto ail analysis of outturns of ships which have called here within the past few months. A perusal of these records shows that the overall figure oi packages landed in a defective condition is not unduly high and we think we are safe in saying that conditions here compart very favourably with other Persian Gulf ports, and indeed with many British and American ports. it may also be mentioned that In many cases the packages shown as landed here in defec tive condition were in that condition at the time of discharge into Landing Company craft i.e. the responsibility for damage is the ocean steamers* and not the Landing Company’s. &amp; With regard to our suggestion that police Guards might be placed on board barges for an experimental period of sav one or two months, we shall be glad to learn if you can*supply two police guards per barge, on receipt of our advices that 1 7 these guards are required. We are arranging to send to the Superintendent, State Police, advices of the arrival of ocean steamers at sitra, and shall be glad to learn if we may makl arrangements direct with him for the supply of guards. 2/I 124 - £ - Auothor impcrtant point in rogard to tho prevention of pilferage is the present hours permitted by the State Engineer for the opening of the Muharraq bridge. Only one hour is allowed in daylight, and you will appreciate that if, at the opening hour between 11 and 12, tide or wjieather are unsuitable, we frequently cannot utilize this opportunity. The period from mid-night to 6 a.m. during which the bridge is opened daily is not a good time to pass barges through the bridge, and the hours of darkness obviously make pilferage much easier. May we suggest that you take up with the statoa Engineer the advisability of opening the fridge say these or four times between sunrise and sunset for a period of half an hour, instead of the present one hour between 11 and 12. if this is done the movement of our barges will be greatly facilitated, mer chants in Manama will receive prompt delivery of their cargo, and wo also believe that pilferage will be considerably reduced. While we take great care to endeavour to ascertain that our barge and launch crows have clean records, it is not possible for us to guarantee their honesty. if, however, you are able to show that any of our present crews have bad characters, please advise us their names and wo will dismiss them immediately. On the subject or landing charges, several merchants stated at the meeting that wo should employ local boats vti on steel barges are not available. We wish to point out that rates or hire demanded by local boat owners are such that landing charges would probably require to be increased by ap proximately b0$ if this type or craft were used. our ex perience is that to lighter cargo economically steel barges are necessary, and we are doing our utmost to increase our barge lleet in this area. We aay mention that we now have four of our barges in Busrah (where they wore sent for repairs) ready for service here, but export formalities required by the Iraq Government following on the introduction of matial law there, have up to now prevented their release. As informed the meeting, the landing of Manama cargo ax. B• I• ships was formerly done by a B.I.S.N. Landing Compairy, but as from March of this year their work has been taken over by us. For many years the B.I.S.N.Co. incurred hoavy losses in the operation of their landing Company here, and you will appreciate that we cannot contemplate the continuance of lightecage business under conditions which involve us in financial loss. We are prepared, however, to continue to undertake Landing work here at the rates originally agreed upon in February 1947 viz. Rs.7/8 and Rs.b/- per shipping ton, for general and bagged cargo respectively until the end of the present year. There after, if it is clear to us that we are carrying out landing work at a loss, wo shall require to ask the Bahrain Government to sanction a further increase in rates. our lighterage costs show a steady increase, and present indications are that the current rates may not permit us to operate landing work on a remunerative basis. An explanation which can be put forward for the slow rate of delivery ox merchants 1 cargo, and one which wo did not mention earlier in this letter, is the inadequate facilities at Manama Customs Wharf to deal with the greatly increased tonnages now coming forward. The fact that barges cannot discharge at low tide and the absence of night work, when required to relieve congestion, also contribute materially to the slow turn round of craft, and consequent delay in delivery of cargo. 3/3 I U We understand that an extenfcioxi of the port faci lities at Manama Custons is under consideration, and we trust that the improvements contemplated will be a# carried out as early as possible.No.B/203 (96/1 dc M.O) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY A number of Persian merchants who came to see me on June 28th made the following complaints: (a) The transport of goods from ships unloading at Sitrah to Manamah takes about ten days and as a result there is an immense amount of pilfering and insurance charges for goods consigned to Bahrain have been greatly increased. (b) Merchants are compelled by the Bahrain Government to keep Indian cloth obtained under the quota system in their godowns for anything up to a year. This locks up their capital and causes loss and inconvenience in other ways. The merchants would be willing to sell this cloth at less than the 25 % profit allowed if only it would be released quickly. I should be grateful for your comments on both these complaints. C.J.

'LB'W ^ Minutes of a meeting held at the Manama Municipal 2* Building on 22nd August 1948 to afford an opportunity for local importers to discuss with the Manager of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie the firm’s request for an increase in Landing Company’s rates. The meeting started at 10 A*M. and ended at 12.30 P.M. His Highness Shaikh Sulman, presided, those present were:- H.S.

Representative, P.C.L. Representative, P.D.Q. Discussions of a general nature regarding conditions * under which cargo was landed took up most of the time. Those present were informed that the meeting was called, by the Government, in order to discuss the proposed increase in Landing Charges. Various merchants expressed dis satisfaction with present conditions referring to pilferage and the high rate of insurance costs which they stated had increased recently as a result of pilferage in Bahrain. It was stated that &amp;/o - 9 c /o was now being charged by insurance companies on Bahrain cargo which was considerably higher than insurance rates elsewhere in the Gulf. It was however subsequently disclosed that this rate applied to cement in paper bags. It was suggested that the Landing Company could purchase more barges to speed up their work as barges were available in the United Kingdom and the firm of Yusuf Kanbo 2/~ Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. Date..*.2 r the other Landing Company, had lately placed orddrs for a number of new barges. His Highness expressed, very strongly, his dis- that satisfaction with present conditions saying/Bahrain had now acquired a bad reputation as a port where cargo was pilfered owing to lack of supervision by the Landing Company. Other merchants stated that they bad only agreed to the last increase in rates on the understanding that conditions would improve. There had been an improvement for some months after which the situation deteriorated till it became as bad as it had ever been before. The Manager of Gray, Mackenzie drew attention to recent changes and reminded the meeting that a short time ago the Company had changed all its Nakhudas at the same time increasing their pay by about 100$ and also increasing the pay of the crews. He reminded the merchants that he had taken on new Nakhudas who were recommended by the leading importers themselves. This was admitted but the merchants strongly disclaimed any responsibility for the Nakhudas. His Highness discussed the question of steamers with cargo for Manama using the Sitra anchorage and discharging Manama cargo at Sitra. He indicated his disapproval of this procedure and said that ships with cargo for Manama must come to the Manama anchorage. There was a long discussion about the depth of the Manama harbour, it was suggested that the Manama anchorage should be re-surveyed. The Manager,Gray Mackenzie said that the Senior Naval Officer had laid down that the Manama anchorage could not be used by vessels drawing more than 24 feet, though larger ships had been known to enter it. He told the 3/-meeting that Stride ships in future, drawing not more than 24 feet would come to Manama. The question of the rise in costs of the Landing Company was discussed and a list of wages showing large increases was examined. It was suggested that the Landing Company should advertise for tenders for porterage etc. and that its labour work should not be carried out exclusively by one contractor. Various people implied that the contractor benefited more from the increased pay than the labourers. The Manager of Gray Mackenzie stated that his Company demanded an increase in Landing rates of Rs.l/8/- per ton both on bag cargo and other cargo. The merchants argued that the Company had no right to demand a further increase in rates until a year had elapsed since the pr evious increase had been granted. A letter from the Manager, Gray Mackenzie was read to them, which was written on the day after the last increase had been approved, stating that should the Company find that it was still operating at a loss the Company would request the Government to consider a revision of charges at the end of 1948. The merchants asked to be supplied with copies of all correspondence on the matter between the Government and Gray Mackenzie. His Highness then put the question to all the merchants present as to whether or not they would agree to an increase of Rs.l/8/- per ton in Landing Charges. Those present unanimously declined to agree to pay the higher rate.No CoaBdentM BAHRAIN RN'^NPT. © . - V r * / wy ^ £ * y f * * r / * r f ' ' K f * 1 / 264 . Bahrein, 5th September, ^ The Adviser to the Bahrein Government, Bahrein* Dear Sir, LIGHTERAGE AT BAHREIN, We thaiak you for the minutes of the meeting held on August 22ad presided over by His Highness Shaikh Sulnan. j 4 j raeeting was held as a result of correspondence in which we advised you that the present rate of landing charges was unrenrunerative* It is with great regret we must advise you that we feel that owing to the introduction of other matters, the main point of the meeting, which was to justify to the Government an application for increased landing charges owing to greatly increased operating costs, was not as fully discus sed as desiiable* The result was that without due consideration or knowledge of the conditions, merchants declined to pay higher rates. We know that higher rates are justified and before commenting in detail on the various points raised at the meeting we wish to confirm that in accordance with the undertaking given at the previous meeting we will continue to land cargo at the present rates until the end of this year. We must also give notice that i-ater if we still consider it essential we shall ask for increased rates to be accepted on January 1st, 1949. We are confident that if due consideration is given to tho increased costs, increased rates will be acceptable by the Government without question. It is clearly laid down in the Landing Agreement that the rates will be subject to agreement between the Government and Shipping Agonts and there is nothing to prohibit discussions in this respect at any time. We will now deal in detail with the main issues raised at the meeting. PIIffERAGE,- it is unfortunate that as a general rule all loss or damage to cargo is immediately blamed on the light©rers as they are the last concern to handle the cargo and therefore more often than not a distorted impression of the situation is obtained. Nevertheless, there is pilferage from barges and all possible steps have been taken to minimise these losses. We have engaged on contract special crews for all barges at greatly increased3. -l2l- w. wages and have had these contracts witnessed by local nerchants of repute* While it is noted that merchants disclaim any responsibility, it is also noticed that not a single suggestion was made to improve matters. We believe that the responsibility for the general security of property in these Islands and the waters around theso islands is accepted by the Government. It can never be possible for a private Company to secure law and order and we do not think it would be thought desirable for a private company to endeavour to take over such a respons ibility. Nevertheless, if the Government or any other interested party has any suggestion to make or help to offer, we shall bo very pleased to consider at any time if the suggestion or offer is of a practical value. That the Port of Bahrein has acquired a bad reputation is a matter of grave concern but we are sure this can be jxit right by the wholehearted co-operation of all concerned. BARGES.- it is our view that we have ample barges and lighters to deal with the quantity of cargo now being landed. The apparent shortage of barges is brought about by the very poor landing conditions now available. The Customs Pier is unsuitable for landing the quantity of cargo now coming forward as it is only possible to piece and keep barges alongside at high tide. There are no facilities for handling cargo other than one very old 4-ton hand crane with the result that with few exceptions all cargo has to be man-handled from barges - a laborious and slow process which greatly contributes to the damage of which merchants complain. We are increasing our barge fleet but it does not seem to be appreciated that this means heavy increase in expenditure which must be met by increased landing charges. We fear that under present conditions the provision of more barges only means that they will lie as floating stores with valuable cargo awaiting discharge. USS OF MANAMA ANCHORAGE BY QCfrAii FREIGHTERS. - it is the opinion of the Chief Navigational Authorities in the Persian Gulf that the Manama anchorage is suitable only for vessels drawing not more than 24 feet. Nnleas ,theae Authorities change their opinion vessels of more than this dr.m^will not ordinarily use anchorage. It is further the opinion of the Chief Navigational Authorities that a survey of Manama anchorage and approaches is unnecessary and that the present Charts give accurate and up to date information. The opinion of unqualified local experts cannot be accepted by Ocean Steamer Companies responsible for ships and cargoes worth many millions of pounds. COST 01’ LABOUR DISCHARGING BAJaGES .— In accordance with the suggestion made by Hisr Highness, we send you herewith a draft of a notice, which we should be grateful if you would kindly cause to be published, calling for tenders for the discharge of barges at Jlanama Customs Pier. Certain safeguards are included in the form of tender. We shall be pleased to receive offers for this work and provided we are satisfiedthe tenderer is capable of carrying out his undertaking we shall be pleased to conclude a contract at a rate lower than that which we now bay. We fear* however* that when this notice to tender is published* it is very likely that the present contractor, who has already indicated that he cannot continue to work at the present rates* will give notice that he will cease to work at the present rates after the expiry of the offer to tender. We nay then be forced immediately to conclude arrange ments at higher rates and we trust you will agree before the notice is published that the difference between the present rates and tho rates we nay be forced to pay can be added immediately to the present rates of landing charges. We shall be grateful for your confirmation on this point before the notice to tender is published. overtime for any work done after 3 p#nu According to bills submitted the amount charged for working from 3 p.nu to 6 p.iru is calculated as equivalent to one whole day^s work. This extra cost is borne by the Landing Company. It will be appreciated that it would be unfair for us to expect bur staff to work on terms less favourable than those enjoyed by the Customs Staff and it is therefore necessary that we arrange to pay our staff overtime as well. This overtime contributes materially to the increased landing cost. On occasions we have to hire local boats often the property of the merchants to land cargo. The standard rate of hire is t- Cemont ... Rs.20 per 100 bags equivalent to Rs.4/“ per ton. Whoat ...

To this must be added 5% Royalty on the Government fixed landing charges plus a reserve for claims payable for shortage and damage occurring during lighterage. The landing charfe Recently the Customs employees have been authorised to charge fixed by the Government for bagged cargo is Rs.5/- per ton which the above figures show to be much less than current local costs. We now summarize the various points raised bearing on the need for increased landing charges *-i4i (? (1) Increased barge crews 1 wages from Rs.350 per nonth to Rs,53^* (2) Cost of increased barge fleet* It is proposed to maintain 8 barges with a capacity of 1500 tons and 8 lighters with a capacity of 240 tons. (3) Increase in staff wages brought about by overtime payment now necessary. (4) Increased cost of all repairs and maintenance work brought about by the general rise in wages* (5) Probable increase on cost of shore labour. We shall be grateful if these matters can be seriously- reconsidered and we shall at any time be glad to meet individuals, or a small Coraraittee appointed by the Government to explain any facts which may not be clear and to discuss means whereby the present unsatisfactory conditior-? can be remedied* We wish to assure the Government that it is our desire to arrange for the landing of cargo at reasonable rates, and we believe that the rates now being discussed Rs.9/- for General Cargo and Rs.7/8/- for bagged cargo are the minimum that can be considered remunerative in the circumstances explained* appreciated and we take this opportunity of thanking His Highness and your goodself for all the trouble that has been taken* Your interest and co-operation in this matter is very much Yours faithfully, For GRAY, MACK r 7 T TP a i n &amp; Co., Ltd.

(196/7/48) I have been recently discussing with Meikle the local merchants’ complaints about the delay in the despatch of cargo from Sitrah to Manama. Heikle maintains that there is no undue delay in such despatch, but that there are freq uent delays in the unloading of barges after they reach Manama, and I attach in original, (return requested) a statement received from him. It does not smear from this that H-rav Markpn^ips arp pr- tirely blameless. For instance, although the 'Baharistan' reached Sitrah on the 13th October, no cargo was despatched to Manama until the 20th. It does appear, however, that there are substan tial delays in the unloading of barges at Manama, and I believe it is generally admitted that the unloading facilities provided by the Bahrain Go vernment there, are inadequate.

POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, D^ted 20th December, 1948 Dear Belgrave, After discussions with Meikle, Sir Rupert Hay writes that he believes that it is generally admitted that the unloading facilities provided by the Bahrain Government at Manamah are inadequate; and asks me to let him know if the Bahrain Government propose to do anything to improve them. I see &lt;&amp;n the last paragraph of your letter No.1736-35.F, dated the 23rd June, 1948, to Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., that in addition to providing new sheds the Government has on order a new powerful crane, but did not at that time propose a further extension of the pier. I should be grateful if you would let me know whether the position has altered in any way since then so as to enable me to reply to Sir Rupert Hay. Yours sincerely, f iff”* j / C - 7 p / C- 4}/ C.D.

Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN. 97U‘f I I' your a, U.JMo.U/L-2^2 elated. 20th Decemher 1948&gt;;the Bahrain Government does not propose, at present, to extend the Customs pier, hut provision has heen made in the Budget, which His Highness has finally approved today, for erecting another shed on the pier and for purchasing a new crane. 2. The new shed will he huilt at the northern end of the existing sheds, it v/ill he closed in on the v/est side and open on the east side and will he used to protect cargo such as grain etc., which is imported into Bahrain. This will give us more space in the old sheds for cargo which is stored in them on the demurrage system. We have q^sked Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie, who are agents for certain British firms, for a quotation for a steel shed that can he roofed with asbestos sheets. This type of roofing seems on the whole more satisfactory than galvanised iron. 3. The Government has ordered, through Messrs. John Birch, a ten ton ,f Smiths' shunting crane, costing £.7300/- which v/ill move along the pier on lines laid on sleepers, this will make it possible to unload cargo by crane from different points on the pier instead of, as at present, from one place ody. When the crane line has heen laid a road down the pier will he surfaced. The crane is expected to he ready for shipment in about June, it was ordered in February 1 948 .J Cog’dsnHa!. ? ^CEIPT. 2,&lt;5W 2..

M*s Political Agent, Bahrain.C.O.No.C/P-1. POTiJTIC/M ^G^NCV, BAHRAIN, Dated 2nd January, 1949 Dear Sir Rupert, Ir y to your semi-official letter No.(196/7/4S)^ dated the 10th Decemler, 1948, I enclose a copy of ar* extract of a letter from Beltjreve to me giving the position at out unload ing facilitifS as far as the Bahrain Government is concerned. 2. I also enclose the statement which Meikle gave you. Yours sincerely, His F.ycellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. CSI,&gt; Thb following comments are submitted in connection with P.A*s note forming enclosure to s.79. The complaints against Gray Mackenzie have a long history as the .attached office note found among the loose papers in the C.O* will show. Its Probable date is circa 1920 - 1922. 2 Herchants . Gray Mackenzie usually disclaim responsibility for any loss or damage to a merchant's cargo, and merchants do not often put in actual claims against them. When, upon inspection, they find their consignments short or damaged they ask Gray Mackenzie,who are Lloyds' agents in Bahrain, to conduct a Lloyds' survey. They send the survey report to their insurance agents, either English or American, with vtoom they have insured the consignments, Sften for considerably more than its market value. The insurance agents pay the insurance, and it is seldom that the latter go to the trouble of attempting to recover the c.i.f. value of' lost or damaged cargo from 'the landing company. In this G.M. receive a decided benefit from being associated with the great name of Lloyds. Should they, for any reason, ever lose Lloyds' agency they would have more claims brought against them by insurance agents, and merchants would not be §0: ready to accept their disclaimers. 3. Oil Companie , s . In regard to the oil companies G.M* are not in so fortunate a position. Both Bapco and Aramco, espacially the latter, make out their own claims in respect of cargo damaged or short-landed and ask G.M. to check and endorse them before any attempt, is made to forward, them to the insurance agents. It often happens that when G.M. check these claims with their tally papers the latter show excess deliveries of cargo under certain marks - when, in fact, the oil company claims cargo under this mark was short-landed - and short deliveries of cargo under other marks. It is unlikely that consignors would ship quantities in excess of their orders, and a mis-tally is the more probable conclusion in these cases. G.M. therefore prefer to settle these claims on the spot, and are paying large sums to the oil companies every month in meeting them. The only real answer to such a situation however is to engage better tally clerks and to pay them wages suffic ient to stop them pilfering. 4. Tally Clerks ,. The tally clerks are inefficient, and their pay is so low - only some P:. 60 p.m. - that their chief purpose in going aboard a ship to tally cargo is to see what they can''make' out of it. Most, if not all, find it difficult to tally by mark, being unable to distinguish properly between one mark and another, and G.M. have recently proposed to tfie oil companies that future tallies should be made on the total number of packages in a consignment and not, as hitherto, on the number of packages under each mark. At the same time G.M. are very dependent as a landing company on the work of their tally clerks and.the tally statements form the only record they have of cargo taken off boats. 5 . Buropeftn Supervisi on. European supervisors have often been mentioned in previous correspondence as a remedy for theft, bad stowage, and damage to cargo. In fact these men commonly work through an interpreter, issue orders but are seldom around to see them carried out, and act merely as superior liaison officers between ships and the landing company. What is really needed, again, is more efficient tally clerks rather than a closer supervision of bad ones. Mr. Meikle's appeal to the Shaikh to raise the general level of morality of his subjects may therefore be fairly met with the retort that Mr. Meikle should first raise the general level of wages of those employed in the responsible work of checking and unloading cargo.9/12 / { t./ se6n from 3,68 that the present dissatisfaction with (j # M s centres around lack of supervision at Sitra, which has apparently not been met by the step proposed in their letter at S.39. The delay Ait Sitra may be due in cart to a li S h ters and barges. From a casual inspection of b.M s board, confirmed on enquiry, most of their barges seem to be working at Has Tanura. When the original landing agreement was made the Bahrain overnment stated that it had no intention of allowing a group of local merchants to set up a landing Company, vide paragraph 9 of Advisers memorandum at p.92 of B.0. File 7/3-1. Cwing to the dissatisfaction that has been felt with G.M*s handling of cargo during the war years and after, this attitude is changing. Director of Customs recently advocated that the ahrain Government take over the discharging of cargo on Manama^pier, and His Highness may now be willing to see a local landing Company established. The original landing agreement was made in 1929, vide enclosure to S.50 and if it was renewed at the end of every 5 years should expire on 14/5/49 and not 14/5/47, as stated The a 6reement seems however to have lapsed in n 4 : dissolll ' tion °f Mespers, vide p.140 and 141 of .file 7/3, and was last renewed in 1942, vide S.9 !' &lt;2 • T- P v (!A its. c/rti % 2J?. ^.£,7 7&gt;. ft. ® q (fa Jifa n. fa, ,fa far fa~ 1 fal'l to., KU &gt;0. rto.
