The letter concludes by stating that the Captain having commenced his destruction of the forts before the agreed time and before a response had been received is contrary to faith, justice and former engagements and that he was sending his confidential servants to discuss the affair with Pelly and renew the engagements that had existed between them.The letter gives the date of writing as 3 Showal [Shawwal] 1282 (19 Feb 1866) also records its date of receipt at the Residency at Bushire as 11 April 1866.Also included is a note from Pelly in regards to the engagements referred to by Abdullah ben Fysul, which his confidential servants did not bring a copy of with them, but had stated that they had existed since the time of Iman Abdul Azeez [Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud] that the Wahabee [Wahhabi] should not commit irregularities at sea and should provide reparation should any irregularities be proved against them, also that the English should not interfere in the Wahabee dominions on land.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023479696.0x000006#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
