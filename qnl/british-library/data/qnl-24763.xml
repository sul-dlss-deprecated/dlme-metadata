It is not altogether clear to me, however, whether having made this inti mation, Government are still prepared to consider the question of lea vino-Sheikh Esa free to take such measures as may seem to him suitable, or whether they would specifically restrict him to the course suggested by Captain Prideaux, namely, that of excluding from Bahrein members of any tribes which are in a position to exercise pressure upon the Behaih with a view to their coming to a settlement. I have frequently seen a course somewhat parallel to this resorted to in Somaliland, in cases where one refractory tribe, debarred from the amenities of the Port has clandestinely sent its trade-goods through, or has been furnished with supplies by, a tribe not under the ban; pressure being then put on the latter. ^ This, however was under a well-organised administration by British officers. I much _ doubt whether such a course could be effectively worked in Bahrein under existing conditions, nor do I think that advice tendered to him in this direction would be acted upon by Sheikh Esa or would in any way remove the grievance which he now nurses in connection with this case. On the other hand, the Sheikh would have no colourable grounds for further complaint if our restrictions on his own liberty of action were with drawn, for it is primarily this that he has himself solicited. 3. In this connection I respectfully invite reference to the observations recorded in paragraph 5 of my letter Nor431 of 9th September 1905, in which I expressed some dissent from Captain Prideaux’s conclusions as to what is admittedly Turkish territory. In dealing with these papers the Government of^ India made no special comment upon this point, but in any case I do not think I shall be guilty of inconsistency if I ventured to recommend a reversion to the course proposed in the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office dated 24th August 1905. 4. There is one other seemingly practicable course which, I think, would be worth a trial, if it does not conflict with views held by the Government of India as to the inexpediency of our having direct dealings with the Behaih our selves, and that is that the Political Agent should be authorised to send a representative to the Behaih Sheikhs concerned under the safe conduct of some neutral Sheikh, with a view to the arrangement of a meeting of influential representatives of the tribes, party to the vendetta, before the Political Agent, either at Bahrein or at some convenient neutral spot, at which our Agent, as Arbitrator, might be able to effect a settlement. h, 3 v. &lt; 2 ^ IkAAjfqoC^10?

In the circumstances it appears to Mr. Morley that, unless Sir N.

It w r ill be observed that the Government of India apparently contemplate informing Sheikh Esa, in the event of the claim being altogether dropped, that the further remedy lies in his own hands by the exclusion from Bahrein of members of any tribes which are in a position to exercise pressure upon the Behaih with a view to their coming to a settlement.

(3) Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 432, dated the 10th September 1905, with enclosures. We have the honour to transmit to you copies of a despatch* from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, together with previous correspondence as marked in the margin relating to the question of obtaining reparation for the murder of certain Bahreinis by members of the Behaih tribe on the mainland opposite the island of Bahrein. The Political Agent at Bahrein has examined the question afresh in view of its more recent developments, and it will he seen from his report to Major Cox that he has arrived at the following conclusions :— (a) That if Sheikh Esa is now given the free hand, hitherto withheld, to exact reparation from the Behaih himself, he must necessarily violate territory under Turkish influence in the process, or raise the question of the status of El Katr in an acute i orm. (ft) That reprisals on Sheikh Esa’s part, if effective, will further aggravate the existing feud. (c) That judging by recent experience, it is doubtful whether the latter’s men would face any serious fighting. They would more probably do no more than murder a few innocent people. Eor these reasons he deprecates the grant of permission to Sheikh Esa to settle accounts with the Behaih according to his own ideas. As an alternative he suggests that we should press the Porte energetically on the Sheikh’s behalf for pecuniary compensation and demand prompt payment of the Rs. 38,500 due. This amount includes Rs! 2,400 dollars blood-money for the lives of Sheikh Esa’s three relations; a form of relief which the Sheikh has hitherto declined to accept, but which the Political Agent apparently suggests guarantee lor the future good oenaviuur ui mo Porte expresses its inability to take this course and at the same time delays pay ment of the compensation demanded, we should retaliate by declining to recog nise any claim on their part to exercise jurisdiction “ tU ® f between Salwa Bay and Katif and also presumably m the Katar peninsula except at A1 Bidaa; and that we should notify our mtention to take me to deal with the tribes direct, preferably by the institution of a blockade of the Dthaharan and Katar coasts. Major Cox substantially concurs in Captain Prideaux ® ? except as regards the proposed blockade ot the Dthaharan and Katar coasts, ^ jk 0 i ,-f &gt;fUw Ithat is he considers that we should insist on payment of compensation hy the that is, ne cuusiuc into nnr own hands and deal Porte 8 and failing * compliance, take the matter into our own hands and deal whh the tribes ourselves; and he considers that such a course will be m itself a bhallenee to Turkish pretensions on the Dthaharan coast and an exposure of the Porte’s inability to exercise jurisdiction there effectively, whatever their rights de jure may be. The present matter has now been the subject of negotiation with the Turkish Government for five years without any practica advance having been made towards the reparation to which the Sheikh of Bahrein is entitled; and it appears to us that an effort should now be made to effect a fina settlement of some kind in one direction or another. It will perhaps be advisable at this stage to review the pros and cons in regard to the policy that should be adopted. On the one hand, we are in the position of having already taken up the at Constantinople with the knowledge of the officials and local Chiefs, includ ing the Sheikh of Bahrein. Due regard must of course be paid to Major Coax’s and Captain Prideaux’s views, both owing to their intrinsic force and to their being put forward by the officers on the spot, who should be specially qualified to express an opinion on what the effects of our attitude on local British prestige are likely to be. It is no doubt highly desirable not only to impress Sheikh Esa with a sense of the value of our protection, but also to make the Turkish officials on the mainland feel that we take our position seriously as protecting Power over Bahrein, and will hold them responsible for injury caused to the subjects of the protected Sheikh by Arabs over whom they claim to exercise authority. On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly clear that the permission which we are authorised to give for the Sheikh to exact reparation himself would be practically useless by reason of the proviso that he must not enter Ottoman territory. We understand that the tribe but rarely quits Turkish territory to wander in El Katr; and even if an attack were organised on the occasion of one of the Behaih’s infrequent visits to the promontory, they would probably have little difficulty in escaping into Turkish territory, before punishment could be inflicted. It will be seen, moreover, that the Political Agent is more than doubtful of the wisdom of attempting or permitting reprisals. In the light of the fresh information now supplied, it would appear that the murder of the Bahreinis by the Behaih was one of three outrages which were all incidents of one feud, and apart from the fact that we have hitherto espoused the cause of Sheikh Esa as one deserving of reparation, it is not clear that the case belongs to a class which calls for the active intervention of the British Government. In such a quarrel it might be considered alike impolitic to grant the Sheikh our sanction to revenge himself in debateable territory (thereby making ourselves responsible for his action) ; or to press the Turkish Government further either to exact punishment which clearly lies beyond their power; or to give compensation, which they have a reasonable case for refusing. Though such a solution would not perhaps be very satisfactory, it is arguable that we had better now accept the Turkish assertion (which is no more capable of disproof than of proof) that 37 out of the 50 individuals have been accounted for, I tell the Sheikh that we are not prepared to press the Turks to take any further action in the case of an outrage arising out of a tribal feud, and advise him that the further remedy lies in his own hands (as pointed out by Captain Prideaux) by the exclusion from Bahrein of members of any tribes which are f n a position to exercise pressure upon the Behaih with a view to their coming to a settlement. To come to the other suggestions of the local officers, we considei that^ our interest in the affair is so trifling as to place beyond the range of serious consideration Major Cox’s suggestion that w e should take the matter into our owm hands and deal with the tribes ourselves, as well as Captain Prideaux’s scheme for a blockade of the Dthaharan and Katar coasts. Moreover, it appears to us doubtful w hether Major Cox does not overrate the effects upon our prestige and interests of inaction in a case which the inhabitants of the Arab coast must recognise to be a blood-feud between two tribes, and not in any way an outrage by the Turks against the British Government. 03 :on tytk iand fei itself a ever i with M itled )pted. After carefully considering all these points we have arrived at the conclusion that there are two possible alternatives: ( 1 ) to press for compensation from the Porte; (2) to drop the case. The other proposed courses of action may, in our opinion, be ruled out as impracticable. Unless therefore His Majesty s Government are prepared to press the claim for compensation at Constantinople, we do not propose to pursue the matter any further so far as the Turks are directly concerned.

Foreign Office Press—No. 326 — 2 - 1 - 06 — 12 . K[Confidential,] No. 431, dated Bushire, the 9th (received 18th) September 1905. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of the Government of „ t . .. , ■, . India, copy of a report which I have received Bahrein No. 279, dated 21 at August 1905. f rom ’ th{ ! J Agenti Bahrein, with reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department endorsement No. 416 -E. B., dated the 31 st January 1905 , to my address, on the subject of Sheikh Esa’s blood-feud with the Behaih tribe. 2 . A study of the question has brought Captain Prideaux to the following conclusions (a) That if Sheikh Esa is now given the free hand, hitherto withheld, to exact reparation from the Behaih himself, he must necessarily violate territory under Turkish influence in the process, or raise the question of the status of Katar in an acute form. (3) That reprisals on Sheikh Esa’s part if effective will further aggravate the existing feud. (c) That judging by recent experience, it is doubtful whether his men would face any serious fighting. They would more probably do no more than murder a few innocent people. For these reasons he deprecates the grant of permission to Sheikh Esa to settle accounts with the Behaih in his own way. 3 . As an alternative he suggests that we should press the Porte energetically on the Sheikh’s behalf for pecuniary compensation and demand prompt payment of the Rs. 38,500 due. This amount includes Rs. 2,400 dollars blood money for the lives of Sheikh Esa’s three relations; a form of relief which the Sheikh has hitherto declined to accept but which, I understand the Political Agent to suggest, should be pressed on him. If that is his meaning, I concur on this latter point, as, if the settlement is arranged through our intermediation, the delivery of three Behaih to Sheikh Esa for execution does not commend itself to me. 4. Reverting to the discussion of possible measures for the termination of the feud, Captain Prideaux recommends that the Turkish authorities be called upon to intern for a time several of the Behaih, as a guarantee for^ the future good behaviour of the tribe, and suggests that if the Porte expresses its inability to take this course and at the same time delays payment of the compensation demanded, we should retaliate by declining to recognise any claim on its part to exercise jurisdiction in the maritime tract between Salwa Bay and Katif (and also presumably in the Katar peninsula except at A1 Bidaa (P. Z. C.)), and should notify our intention to take measures to deal with the tribes direct, prefer ably by the institution of a blockade of the Dthaharan and Katar Coasts. 5 . In forwarding the Political Agent’s communication, I venture to offer a few observations in comment of it. If Sheikh Esa is allowed to take his own measures for exacting reparation from the Behaih Captain Prideaux holds that he must necessarily operate “ on admittedly Turkish soil, or else in Katar, etc.,” as the Dthaharan Coast tract between Salwa Bay and Katif is frequented by tribes “ who are subsidised to a small extent by the Turkish Government for the safe passage^of their mails, and must therefore presumably be regarded as Turkish territory. ” If this be accepted, the stipulation imposed by His Majesty’s Government that Turkish territory must not be violated, would render nugatory any per mission given to Sheikh Esa to exact his own revenge.a I am doubtful however as to the correctness of this view. We have never. I think, recognised Turkish jurisdiction over this Dthaharan We have never, » ™ . s ^ aU events up t0 February 1904 (f'* ‘he reference marginal^ noted): ?5 8-e a., dated 28th March 1904. although on the other hand 1 notice that in the Military Report on Arabia published by the General Staff of the War Office in December 1904, the tract in question is included in territory under Turkish jurisdiction, whereas the Katar Peninsula is excluded ; but this ex- position is doubtless not authoritative. Furthermore, in a later communication which I have just received from j r. w 100 q him and am forwarding separately, the Bahrein No. 304, dated the 2nd Septem 9 5 - p 0 jj t j ca | Agent refers to the authority of the Turks in Dthaharan as only nominal and reiterates his recommendation that we should ourselves take action against the tribes. I think this latter view regarding the Dthaharan tract is the correct one, and if it is accepted as such, then the objection to Sheikh Esa taking his own measures 'fo^vengeance for fear of the violation of Turkish territory, loses most r»f its force. 6. At the same time, both from the point of view of our own prestige and having regard to the latent possibility that Sheikh Esa’s embarkation upon measures of reprisal may result in an indefinite prolongation of the vendetta, I incline to the opinion that it would be much better for us to insist on payment of compensation by the Porte, and failing compliance, to take the matter into our own hands and deal with the tribes ourselves ; a course which will be in itself a challenge to Turkish pretensions on the Dthaharan Coast, and an ex posure of the Porte’s inability to exercise jurisdiction effectively, even if it possessed the title. The obstructive apathy and impotence of the Turkish authorities seem to afford ample justification for any action that would bring the matter to a settle ment, but whether the pursuit of either of the courses above mentioned is prac ticable at the present time, depends upon the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and is therefore a problem beyond my province to discuss. In any case, I fear that the blockade of the Dthaharan and Katar Coasts suggested by the Political Agent cannot be regarded as practically possible without a large increase of our Naval resources in the Gulf. One thing, however, cannot, I submit, be gainsaid and that is, that if we have any regard for our interests and prestige among the inhabitants of the Arab Coast, we cannot afford to be trifled with by the Ottoman Government any longer, and are bound to take effective steps to insure that Sheikh Esa’s grievance is redressed in some form without further delay. No. 279, dated Bahrein, the 21st August 1905. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with your office endorsement No. 208 , dated the 14 th February 1905 , on the subject of the blood- feud between the people of Bahrein and the Behaih section of the A1 Morra tribe, and to submit for consideration the following observations. 2 . In the first place I would point out that the account given in Mr. Gaskin’s letter No. 178 , dated the 24 th August 1902 , to Colonel Kemball’s address, is apparently not quite accurate in some respects, as I have interrogated Sheikh Esa regarding the circumstances of the Behaih Sheikh’s visit to Bahrein, and his reply seems to show that as far as the feud between the Behaih and the Amamara was concerned the advantage remained with the latter even after Sheikh Rashid bin Muqareh had returned to the mainland.3. Sheikh Esa has informed me that Sheikh Rashid, the Behaih Chief, came over to Bahrein about 3 months after the retaliatory attack made by the three Amamara on Sheikh Rashid’s young son, with a view to getting satis faction from the Chief for the boy’s murder. Presumably he did not consider that Amamara were justified in visiting upon his own family their vengeance for the act of his four tribesmen, and professing for the time being to regard himself as one of Sheikh Esa’s subsidized feudatories he appealed to him for the punishment of the guilty Amamara. One of whom at least was and is still a trusted servant of the Bahrein Chief, 4 . Sheikh Esa says “ I told Sheikh Rashid that his son was murdered for the blood of Abdallah A1 Mutawwa of the Amamara tribe, that the two tribes should settle their feud amongst themselves, and that the matter was no con cern of mine. If, however, Sheikh Rashid would abandon the feud, it would be so much the better. Sheikh Rashid replied that he had only peaceful inten tions. I then gave him as a token of my friendship a horse worth 600 dollars and cash and other things to the value of 200 dollars. This gift was in no way connected with the blood-feud between the Behaih and the Amamara. Bin Muqareh promised to continue loyal and friendly to me and went away apparent ly quite satisfied. His subsequent action proved his insincerity.” From this account it is not difficult to understand that Sheikh Rashid must have been chagrined at Sheikh Esa’s refusal to punish the Amamara, his subjects, and that the Bahrein Chief’s gift was made chiefly in connection with his foolish custom of subsidizing the mainland Bedouin whenever they come to the Islands to renew their assurances of loyalty and service. Sheikh Rashid no doubt saw the wisdom of dissembling his dissatisfaction while in Bahrein, but it is not surprising that he should have left, determined in his mind to wreak vengeance in future upon any of the people of Bahrein who should fall into his hands, and the more nearly connected they might be to the Chief the greater satisfaction would be his. c. In the course of my recent work connected with the Persian Gulf Gazetteer, so far as it relates to this Agency, I have satisfied myself that the southern boundary of the Katar Peninsula is regarded by all the Arabs as a fairly straight line from Salwaat the Apex of the Gulf of Bahrein on the west to the Khor al Odeid on the east, passing one well-known well named Saqaq abmit midway between these two points.^ The whole of the country north of the Salwa Apez as far as the Katif Oasis is known as Dthaharan, and this District as well the country due south of Katar up to the Oman border is frequented only by tribes, the Ejman, Beni Hajirand Al Morra, who are subsidized to a small extent by the Turkish Government for the safe passage of their mails, and it must therefore presumably be regarded as Turkish territory. It results, therefore, that if the Chief of Bahrein is permitted to send an expedition against the Beham on the mainland it will either be operating on admittedly Turkish soil or else in Katar and in the latter case the question of the status of that Peninsula will pro a y become acutely and prematurely prominent. 6 In mv humble opinion the permission which His Majesty’s Government contemplate granting to Sheikh Esa to take his own measures for revenging him self should emphatically be withheld. I have endeavoured to show that e three outrages which have already occurred are all incidents of the one feud and if the next aggressive action is taken by the Bahreinis, it will be impossible to nut a Emit u fon the evils which may ensue. The Bahreinis m consequence of their commercial connection with Hofuf and Katif, are always in a vulnerable position whilst the Behaih are extremely difficult to touch when on their ^ ^ a mnrpovpr iudging from my observations of the conduct of Esf’s ™oldiers’’in my two recent little expeditions after the pirate Ahmed bin Selman I beTeve that whilst a fair fight would be avoided to the utmost extent oTtheir power a number of murders of innocent persons would qu.te pos- sS Jesuit whiS would involve the Chief in diffieult.es of much greater magm- tude. . . . . - n The Turkish Government have argued that the Bahreinis are entitled to no consMefadon, because they landed on Turkish sod without permission and with arms in their hands.4 ft They (the Turks) profess to regard the Arab tribal law, which permits the life of any one member of the aggressive tribe to be taken in revenge for t e life of a member of another tribe, regardless of the question whether the indi vidual is guilty or innocent, as inconsistent with t^ e ^ s ^ amlc criminal laws of the Empire. They have also pointed out that Sheikh Rashid bin Muqareh and his elder son were themselves killed in the attack upon the Bahreinis. • u ® 8 . More important than those points, I think, are the facts that when the first Ammari* was killed by the Behaih, » singular of Amamara. nQ a ppii ca tion for redress was made to the Residency by the Chief of Bahrein, and that if the retaliatory murder of Sheikh Rashid’s son was committed without the knowledge of Sheikh Esa, which I consider very doubtful, no signs of disapproval were at any rate afterwards ex pressed by him at his subject’s action. 9 . In these circumstances, I do not think it is necessary that we should support the Chief in his demand for the execution of three more haphazardly selected members of the Behaih or for their surrender to him. I am doubtful whether we should press for the full pecuniary compensation demanded, but if this is done the amount adding 2,400 dollars (Rs. 3 , 360 ) for the lives of the Chief’s own 3 relatives would be Rs. 38 , 500 , and I think that the prompt payment of this, or any lesser sum which may be considered suitable, should be demanded of the Turkish Government in firm language. 10 . The attitude of Sheikh Esa himself towards the Bedouin of the mainland in my opinion is most weak and unsatisfactory. Every year hundreds of Ejman Beni Hajir and A1 Morra, besides the Nayim of Katar, cross over to the Islands to draw their annual subsidies and ‘presents’ from the Chief, and yet of the two sections of the Beni Hajir, Sheikh Nasir bin Mubarak A1 Abdallah is now generally recognised as the leader of the Makhadthdthaba in virtue of his mother having been the daughter of a former Sheikh, and Ahmed bin Selman, the pirate, lives for eight months of the year in the encampment of the A1 Muhammad, having married the sister of their Chief. If all the Beni Hajir and the numerous sections of the A1 Morrah were rigorously forbidden to visit Bahrein until some suitable treatment had been meted out to the members of their tribes and the other persons whom they harboured, who were known to be Sheikh Esa’s enemies a much more satisfac tory condition of affairs would be inaugurated for Bahrein. At the present time, however, the Chief, apart from his unwillingness to adopt this line of action would probably find it impossible to enforce such a prohibition without our assistance, as his permanent armed followers are so few in number. Before leaving this subject I may mention as an instance of Sheikh Esa’s weakness that a few weeks ago when the Kaim-makam of Katif was searching for all the members of the A1 Muhammad Sheikh’s family with a view to putting pressure upon them to deliver up Ahmed bin Selman, the son of one of the arrested men and a cousin by marriage of the pirate leader fled to Bahrein for safety and re mained here openly for a few days, though he had disappeared again before I heard of his visit. This man, Hamad bin Tami, apparently has contrived to ingratiate himself with the Chief and is always given a welcome to these Islands. ii. To revert to the question of the Behaih blood-feud, I believe that ordi narily the simplest method of repressing such an affair is to extort a heavy guarantee or a number of hostages from both parties for the future maintenance of the peace. In the case of Bahrein such a course is not necessary, as there is no likelihood of any of the Behaih visiting Sheikh Esa’s territories while the feud last. I would recommend, however, that the Turkish Government be re quested to take some such action in regard to the Behaih and that if they declare their inability to do so and also make any delay in paying the compensation, they should be told that in the circumstances we decline any longer to recognize the subordination of the Dthaharan tribes to the Hasa Government, and that we will take our own measures for dealing with them direct. I believe that by an effective blockade of the Dthaharan and Katar Coasts for some months, so as to prevent all Bedouin coming to Bahrein or going to the pearl-banks we could cause a very heavy pecuniary loss to the tribes and would probably reduce them to a more genuine submission than has ever been done before.

The two sufferers are now under the treatment of Dr. Thoms, of the Arabian Mission, through whom I first heard of the affair. I am informed that, when the other boatmen laid their complaint before Sheikh Isa, they were most unfavourably received, and I have had no communication on the subject from the Chief, which surprises me considerably. It seems possible that the Chief’s peculiar reception of the news and his subsequent reticence is due to the fact that he has hitherto failed to obtain any satisfaction in the earlier and more important affair of his cousin’s murder by the same tribe. 3. I have communicated the facts of the recent case to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, with a view to the Turkish authorities being moved to take suitable action, but I do not suppose that any satisfaction will be forthcoming until I have been provided with the steam launch which, I understand, has been for some time under the consideration of the Government of India. Statement of Sultan-bin-Sayf-bin-Thakhayel and Mukammad-bin-Abdulla-bin-Thakhayel of the tribe of Manamah and residents of Hudd in Muharrag. We with seven others in one Mashuwa and another Mashuwa with eight men, including a Sidi, slave of Ali bin Isa bin Thaluch, sailed from Hudd on 28th Thilcada 1322 (3rd Pebruary 1905) and landed at Ras-Abu Huekhil on the coast of Hasa, south of Ojair. There we commenced collecting firewood. All of a sudden we were attacked by Bedouins of the tribe of Marrah-al-Behaih. We ran away from them and tried to get back to our boats. The Bedouins hotly pursued us, firing at us at the same time, and at last succeeded in catching the Sidi boy whom they carried oif. While we were raising the anchors of our boats, we, two cousins, Sultan and Muhammad, received two bullet wounds each. Sultan—one bullet passing through the left leg and the other through the right leg and penis ; Muhammad— one bullet on the penis which was divided into two, and the other in the right hand, both bullets passing through.♦] ^ No. 43a, dated Bushire, the 10th (received 18th) September 1905.

The Mutessarif states that he does not know the place Ras-el-Heykil, where the outrage is alleged to have occurred, and adds that the result of his enquiries tends to show that no such incident occurred on the Coast south of Ojeir, and that, if it did occur anywhere, it was not within his jurisdiction and the aggressors are unknown.

The only additional information which I can give is that the scene of the piracy is about 15 miles north of Salwa—the point where the Katar and Dthaharan coasts meet—and is a place well known to all the sea-faring and nomad people of these parts. The Bahreinis cannot give the names of any of their assailants, but they are certain that they were members of the Behaih tribe. The incident and the attitude adopted by the Turks in connection with it are additional proofs supporting the view referred to in my letter No. 279, dated the 21st August 1905, to your address, that the Turks’ authority over the 3 Bedouin tribes of Dthaharan is only nominal, and giving emphasis to my re commendation that we should take vigorous action against the tribes ourselves if the Turks do not quickly adopt a stronger policy towards them. In addition to the blockade which I have suggested I believe that there are a few date gardens at intervals along the coast, which the Bedouin tend in a casual manner and the destruction of these would not only increase the tribes’ punishment but would also in a small degree remove an inducement for coast.Sir:- With reference to your letter of December 3rd last year relative to the murder of Bahreinese by the Behaih Tribe, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you herewith, for the in formation of Mr secretary Brodrick, copy of a despatck- from Sir N O’Conor on the subject.

Ity Lord:- With reference to Your Lordship's despatch No.422 of the 8th of December last and to previous correspondence respecting the murder of the Sheikh Selinan and other Bahreinese by members of the Behaih tribe, I have the honour to report that I have re ceived communication through the Dragomanate of the „ translation of a despatch which the Minister of the Interior has addressed to the Minister of Foreign Af fairs in reply to the Memorandum handed to Tewfik Pasha on the 20th of October last, as reported in Mr. Townley's despatch to Your Lordship No.832 of the 25th of that month. The despatch of the Minister of the In terior, copy of which in translation I herewith en close, gives a summary of the contents of a despatch from the Vali of Basra and of the detailed report furnished The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.furnished by the Mutessarif of Nejd who had been in structed to conduct invest igations in the Kaza of Katif and also to make enquiries in other quarters. This report merely recapitulates the informa tion already supplied by the authorities of Nejd viz. that the motive of the murder was revenge for the death of the son of Rashid bin Mekiarih, one of the chief men of the Behaih tribe, who was killed on the Island of Bahrein, and that all the persons known to have taken part in the attack on Sheikh Selman* s party to the number of 37, including all the six persons specified by His Majesty*s Embassy as having been among the participators in the affair, have been killed in various encounters with the Turkish troops or other tribes. The report again draws attention to the material difficulties in the way of any attempt being roade by the Turkish authorities to recover blood money or com pensation from the Behalds, and concludes by assert ing that of the 50 individuals who are stated by His Majesty’s Government to have participated in the murdermurder, 37 have been accounted for. Including the six persons specifically named, and that unless His Majesty's Embassy can produce further evidence with regard to the guilt of the remainder and more detail ed information to lead to their identification, it is not in the power of the local authorities to take any further action. I have &amp;c.. (Signed) N.R.O*Conor.&gt; Translation. X3 Copy of a despatch from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, dated 27/10 July, 1905. A despatch has now been received from the Vali of Basra, enclosing copy of a detailed report from the Mutesarrif of Nejd, in which it is stated that according to the investigations undertaken in the Kaza of Katlf, to which district the place which was the scene of these events belongs, and to various other enquiries which have been instituted, it has been ascertained that Rashid bin Mekiarih, one of the chief men of the El Bejaij (Behaih) tribe, hav ing gone with his son (Mohamed) to (the coast op posite) Bahrein, while they were pasturing their camels in that neighbourhood, the said Mohammed was killed by Bahreinees. His father Rashid ibn Mekariah made repeated applications to Sheikh Issa of Bahrein and to his relatives and dependents, demanding the hlood of his son but he was himself eventually driven out and forced to fly from there and on his return to his own tribe he strove to incite them to take I theirtheir revenge for this deed* Subsequently to this. Sheikh Selman, one of the Sheikhs of Bahrein, with a number of followers, crossed over to the desert, where this tribe happened to be, on a hunting ex pedition. Rashid got news of their presence and went at nightfall with a number of his people and the incident in question took place. The persons whose names are given by the Em bassy as having been amongst the participators in this affair amount to six, of whom Rashid ibn Mekiarih and Rashid ibn Dewaris were slain in the affair it self, while Mohsin ibn Dewaris also died subsequent ly from the effect of wounds received there. Previously to this Mutib el Munnakhar having encountered Sheikh Ahmad, a brother of Jasim et Thani, the Kaimakam of Katr, as he was on the road to Ahsa, was killed, in consequence of a longstanding enmity between them. Coming to Mohsin and Talib, these two likewise fell amongst the eight relatives of Rashid ibn Mekiarih, their maternal uncle, who were slain lateron in another encounter. Hasean Sheremlt and Mohammed ibn Nejdan and Teritor also, v/ho belonged to the Bejaii and were amongst the participators in the slaughter of Sheikh Selman and his companions, and with them likewise Ali bin Menakib, Abu Mekiarih, Hasson abu Katife, Hadlf ibn Teitab and the two sons of Ritban ibn Mekiarih, named Mohammed and Mohs in, all belonging to the Bejaij tribe and implicated in the same af fair, were slain by the Imperial troops in the course of an encounter which took place in a locality named Zernouka. Other Bejaij tribesmen, Hamid abu Menakib, his son Ali, Rashid bin Mohammed bin Subjit, Ali bin Mohammed bin Zeile and Suluman bin Diakj, as well as Abdullahi bin Abdullah of the Al-farfars section of the A1 Bejaij, fell in encounters that took place during the pursuit instituted by the late labour Aghasi Ali Agha. Still other leading members of the tribe, v/ho are credibly reported to have taken part in the affair in question viz: Hamid el Mohama, MohammedMohammed tin Nassir bin Berejik, Nedjlb es Scan, Mohammed bin Neddib and his son Rashid Bin Hayya and Hamid el Mohsen, were slain in an encounter which took place with the Mjman Tribe on the 28th Zil Hidje of last year at a place named El Jauf. Abdullah and his brother Mohsin, belonging to the A1 Douma section of the Bedaij, with Jaaber bin Said and his nephew All bin Said, of the al Ghatman Section, were killed in an encounter which took place between them and a military detachment which had been despatched from the chief town of the Sandjak in the direction of Ojelr. Accordingly the 37 persons named above who are shown by official investigation to have been impli cated in the Incident complained of (and who include all the six Indicated by the Embassy as having par ticipated in it) are proved to have been killed at various times and places. Neither the Embassy nor the local authorities have any information as to who besides these 37, were concerned in the affair.. As to the three persons whose execution is de manded by Sheikh Issa, it cannot be understood who they35 they are and obviously no action can he taken against unknown individuals. The Bejaij are essentially' a desert-tribe having no property or possessions of any sort, so that, whatever pressure may be exer cised upon them, it will be impossible to exact from them the blood-money or compensation demanded. Even if efforts be made to pursue the tribe it self on account of this business, as they conceal themselves in the Hejaz and the sandy wastes of Nejd, it will be impossible to get hold of them. With regard to the declaration that the Sheikh of Bahrein might settle this matter locally without having recourse to the intervention of the Imperial Authorities, if the Sheikh’s intention in this respect be to enter into correspondence with the Bejaij with a view to disposing of the difference between them and effecting a composition amicably, it is obvious that the Imperial Government could not be backward in affording every possible assistance. If on the contrary it be to bar their access to Bahrein by means of the neighbouring tribes and to makemake reprisals and Incite them to kill them, then he will not only he kindling the flames of disorder and giving rise to a most undesirable state of af fairs, rife with difficulties and objections, but he will also be interrupting intercourse between Bahrein and the desert and inflicting most serious injury on local trade. The Report concludes by pointing out tha^ v/hen it is claimed that the persons implicated in the murder of Sheikh Selman and his companions numbered no less than 50 but only six of these could be speci fied by name, no further objection can be raised in face of the declaration of the Imperial Government that 37 persons, ascertained to have been partici pators in the incident, have been slain. If however the previous declarations are per sisted in (by the Embassy) it will be necessary to specifically indicate the guilty persons, to prove their complicity and the degree of their culpability and then, under the justice-protecting influence of His Imperial Majesty no effort will be spared inthe zealous endeavour to meet the requirements of justice accordingly.AfrtU-) LXhilS)ocnme^ylf the Prgperty of Mis Britan&amp;o Majesty's eOTemncui-j [December 12.] Section 3.

Memorandum by Mr. Marinitsch. [Foreign Office despatch No. 338 of September 24, 1904.] WITH reference to the murder of Sheikh Selman and his followers, I have the honour to report that the Memorandum drawn up on the last information supplied to the Government of India, which Mr. Lamb presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (see his Memorandum No. 348 of the 20th October, 1904), was referred to the consideration of the Minister of the Interior. _ it vi I have had several interviews on this matter with Memdouk 1 asha, and 1 did not fail to impress upon his Excellency the necessity of having this affair brought to a satisfactory solution, the more so as the fresh information now supplied by the Govern ment of India to this Embassy, and communicated by the latter to the bublime Porte, will, no doubt, facilitate the action of the local authorities. His Excellency Memdouk Pasha, taking into consideration the fact that the Vali of Bussorah had just reached his post, thought it advisable, in order to acquaint him with the details of this affair, to instruct Talib Bey, the ex-Mutessarrf of Nejd, who is at present in Constantinople, to draw up a full report on it, expressing, at the same time, his personal views on the matter. u * • Talib Bey has already presented his report to His Excellency. It seems that m Tali!) Bey’s opinion it will be almost impossible to seize the remaining culprits owing to the nomad habits of the Behain tribe. . . p ,i Talib Bey thinks that the amount claimed as pecuniary compensation tor the plundered propertv is exaggerated, as the murdered Sheikh and his followers were merely on a shooting trip and could not, therefore, have brought with them so much ^^ddie Minister of the Interior did not indorse Talib Bey’s statements; he has simply mentioned them to me for the information of His Majesty’s Embassy. On ib- contrary his Excellency requested me to give full assurances to His Majesty s Embassy to’the effect that he will continue to use his best efforts with a view to In vino- those who are implicated in these murders arrested and punished. His Excellency is however, afraid that the measures to be taken by the Turkish authorities to Hat end will prove abortive, owing to the lack of proper means of communica tion between Bussorah and the Sandjak of Nejd, which is at so great a distance. Memdouk Pasha called my attention to the inconsistency, from the point of view both of the Sheri and the criminal laws, of the demand of the Sheikh of Bainem to the effect that three of the principal men concerned m these outrages should L ' [2280 m —3]m * ' It executed in satisfaction for the lives of Sheik Selman, his son Diaij, and his nephew Abdnr Rahman-i bn-Reshid, for whose murder the C hief cannot accept compensation. In his Excellency’s opinion, owing to the wandering nature of the Beliaih tiibes- men, there will be no possibility whatsoever of obtaining evidence, as the witnesses who should be called before the Court will never appear. In the letter now addressed to the V ali of Bussorah, His Excellency Memdouk Pasha laid stress on the fact that the local authorities should try to lay hands on the culprits when the tribesmen next come, as they usually do once a year for the purpose of exchanging products, close to the limits of the vilayet. In conclusion the Minister of the Interior stated to me that under present circumstances he was unable to give categorical instructions to the A'ali, but he has directed him to make fresh and full inquiries into this matter, and to report the result of his investigations, in order that the Sublime Porte may give a decision. 6 (Signed) H.

Sir, _ AVith reference to your telegram, dated the 17th May 1904, and in continuation of our telegraphic reply, dated the 17th June 1904, we have the j honour to forward, for information, a copy of a report received from the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, together with copies of certain connected papers, relative to the murder, in December 1900, of a party of Bahreinese near El Katif by the Behaih tribe. 2. Prom the details now furnished, it will be observed that the persons • Sir n. ©’Conor’, debate Nc ns, dated reported,* by the Wall of Basrah, to 23 rd February 1904 . have been killed in a fight at Zernaka between a Turkish convoy and Bin Mekiriah and his companions, were not those actually concerned in the murder of Sheikh Selman and his followers; and that the real perpetrators of the outrage are still at large, and presumably t Enclosure to sir n. o’Couor', de, P atch No. so, within Turkish jurisdiction. The conten- dated 26 th January i 9 u|. ^ tionf of the Governor of Nejd that the murder was the outcome of animosity is also refuted. Mh. Gaskin s letter No. 219, dated the 12 th December 1900, formed one of the enclosures to our Secret despatch No. 7, dated the 27th January 1901. A copy of his letter No. 9, dated the 27th January 1901, and also of Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball’s letter No. 4 S. A., dated the 6 th June 1902, in which the purport of Mr. Gaskin’s references dated, respectively, the 3rd and 17th May 1902, was included, are now enclosed. 8 . In view of the attitude adopted hy Sheikh Isa in refusing to accept our advice in regard to the administration of his Customs revenues, we have deemed it advisable to withhold for the present from the Chiel any inti mation regarding the concession which His Majesty’s Government are pre pared to make to him in the matter of avenging himself on his enemies on the mainland, and we intend, with your approval, to make no communication to him on the subject pending the receipt of the orders of His Majesty’s Govern ment on the proposals put forward in our Secret despatch No. 85, dated the 21st April 1904, for a revision of the arrangements for British representation at Manama. (rvH)If there is likely to be delay in the issue of these orders, we would suggest that, in order to prevent the possibility of the Sheikh’s case being prejudiced by delay, the fact of the murderers being still at large, and in Turkish territory apparently, might be brought to the notice of the Porte. As the Sheikh is precluded from proceeding against them while in that territory, the advisability of again pressing for the payment of pecuniary compensation might also be considered.

M ratislaw, Esq., Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. 1233 of December 22nd last, regarding the murder, on Turkish territory, of the cousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, with his son, his nephew, and 23 followers. I have drawn tbe attention of the Wali of Basrah to this outrage in a memo- Fandum embodying the facts which I communicated to him through my Dra goman, and of which a copy is enclosed herewith. Mohsin Pasha stated in reply that he had already received a report on the subject from his subordinates on the spot, and that he had given orders for the arrest and punishment of the guilty parties, not only in order to satisfy the Sheikh of Bahrein, but also because the laws of Turkey required it in the ordinary course of procedure. But in the meantime, he would like to know what was the real object of the murdered men’s visit to the mainland at a place where they had already incurred the enmity of the inhabitants by committing a murder last year. His Excellency seemed to imply that they had gone there again with some object which would not hear investigation, and that the hunting excursion was only a blind. Dated Basrah, the 28th December 1900. Memorandum by Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul. On the 3rd of December, a body of Arabs, belonging to the Behaih section of the Almurra tribe, treacherously attacked Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij, oousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, who was on the mainland on a hunting excursion at a place called El Derya, about 30 or 40 miles south of Katif. The attack took place in the early morning while the victims were asleep, and Sheikh Selman, his son, and his nephew, with 23 followers, were murdered in cold blood, only three of his party escaping. His Excellency the Wali has no doubt already received a full report of the above incident; but in case he desires further information, it can be obtained from Her Majesty’s Consulate.2 It is unnecessary to point out the desirability of affording satisfaction the Sheikh of Bahrein for the murder of his relatives by the prompt arrest and punishment of the guilty parties, and of thus depriving him of pretext for taking the law into his own hands. It would immensely add to the difficulties of the already complicated situation in this part of Turkish Arabia, were the Sheikh of Bahrein, despairing of obtaining satisfaction from the Ottoman authorities, to himself organise an expedition against the Almurra, No. 129, dated Bushire, the 3rd Febuary 1901.

'With reference to your depatch No. 2 , dated the 2nd January, on the subject of the murder, on Turkish territory, of the cousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, with his son and 23 followers, I have the honour to forward copy of a * No. 9 , dated the 27 th January 1901 , and encio- further letter 5 ^ from the Assistant Political sure (translated). Agent at Bahrein on the subject. There appears to be no doubt that the murdered Sheikh, with his followers, had no object in view but hunting when they visited the mainland, and I trust that he Turkish authorities will take early and energetic action in the matter, with a view to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice. No. 9, dated Bahrein, the 27th January 1901. From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of endorsement No. 38, dated the 11 th instant, forwarding a copy of a letter, dated the 2 nd January 1901, from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, and calling for an enquiry and a report on the subject-matter of the letter. I would venture to report that I duly made enquiries into the matter, and have come to the conclusion that Sheikh Selman and his party went to the mainland for no other propose than that of hunting as customary for them to do in that season of the year. If His Excellency the Wali of Basrah was led to believe to the contrary, he has been deliberately misinformed. The members of the ruling family of Bahrein every year at the end of the autumn make up hawking parties and visit Katr, Thabran (the country between Katif and Ojair), and Lingah; and, in accordance with the practice. Sheikh Selman, in November last, elected to go to Thahran, and others at about the same time went to Katr and Lingah. The A1 Khalifah family, as stated in my previous report, have no blood-feud with any tribe residing in Turkish territory. . T ? 16 details which led to the murder referred to by Mohsin Pasha are fully given in the original statements made on oath sent herewith. They corroborate the main facts given in the fifth paragraph of my letter No. 219, dated the 12th December last, except in the dates. The third document shows that subsequent to the murder, Rashid-bin-Megarih, Sheikh of the Behaih and father of the person murdered by the Amamera, covenanted, according to Arab usage, with the Chief of Bahrein through his son, Sheikh Hamad, regarding his loss, and accepted a mare, clothes, and cash to the amount of Rs. 1,060, in settlement of his son’s blood. The Chief of Bahrein was in no way bound to make this settle ment, as I understand that, under the recognised Arab tribal laws, only the sec tion of a tribe of which a member kills a person is held responsible, and the life of one of the members may be taken, and the other sections of the same tribe aie not liable to suffer, the A1 Khalifah having no connection with the Amamera, except that the latter reside in their territory, are therefore not liable to answer for any murderous acts committed by the Amamera, who have, in this instance, taken the lite of the son in the place of the life of one of their tribesmen killed by the Behaih.family entertained no desi-ns against the Beh ^ Sh ° WS tbat ll!s had any other motU ^ ^ Sheikh Selm “ undoubtedly have taken a more numemm f i] US V1Slt the mamland, he would b«. »&lt;,, x:xss Sri*“, Enclosure No. 2 .

His Excellency the Wali asks for information, and ex orts the Chief to refrain from retaliation, and the Acting Mutasarif wants to know the whereabouts of the murderers, and calls for a list showing the value of the articles that were stolen. I he Chief has informed His Excellency that he has submitted all the facts to the British Government, through whose officers no doubt His Excellency has already heard them, and that no hostilities will take place if the Ottoman Government punish the offenders and recover the stolen property. He has told the Acting Mutasarif that he is not aware of the whereabouts of the Behaih, and has complied with his request as regards the plundered property. It appears from the communications received by the Chief that the Ottoman Government intend to take serious action in the matter of punishing the murderers and the recovery of the value of the lost articles. If the Govern ment, however, fail to do anything, I think that the whole matter may be settled by the payment of an indemnity of about Rs. 30,000.

You are aware that, if this incident is allowed to pass unheeded, it will develop into a serious one, and loss of lives and bloodshed between the Islams will ensue, which is not pleasing to God. I request you to take steps to prevent such an incident, and to furnish me with details of the case.4 Translation of a letter from Sheikh IsA-BiN-ALi-AL-knALiEAH, to His Excellency Mohsin Pasha, Wali of Basrah, dated 12th Dil Kada 1318 (4th March 1901). dfter compliments .—I received your letter, dated the 26th Ramzan, on the 8 th instant, requesting me to acquaint you with the facts of the murder of my cousin Selman-bin-Diaij, his son Diaij, and his nephew Abdul Rahman-bin- Rashid, with 22 followers, and the wounding of two. The details of this outrage were communicated by me to the High (British) Government, and Your Excellency has no doubt made enquiries from its representative in your territory. I have done nothing displeasing to God in this affair, and you request me to prevent a similar incident. I trust that, through the High (Turkish) Govern ment and your good offices, punishment will be meted out to the perpetrators of the murders, so that the hearts of all may rejoice, and the stolen articles recovered.

After compliments .—I transmit to you a letter which has been received from the Walayet of Basrah concerning you in connection with the murder of Selman and his followers who had gone to Dahran on a shooting excursion. It is well known that the authorities (Turkish) have not been inactive, since the time the outrage was committed, in investigating the matter, but are endeavouring to capture the murderers and to recover the stolen articles. Through the shadow of the Sultan I sincerely hope that the men will be seized, whether they be far away or near, and that the rifles recovered. In view of your friendship, it is necessary that you take steps to prevent an incident which would be displeasing to God and the Sultan, and to avoid an outrage similar to the one which has occurred and which, since the time it took place, has deprived me of peace. 1 * * * As I have received no particulars from you regarding the incident, I request you to inform me in what direction you think the murderers are, and what is the nature and quantity of the articles that were looted, so that I may comply with the orders conveyed to me, and that I may reply to the letter I have received. I pray to God that the steps which are being taken will prevent the occurrences of like outrages, which are the cause of anxiety to you. I also request you to send me your reply to the Basrah letter, so that I may forward it on.

In eontinuation of my letter No. 40, dated the 10th March 1901, I have honour to ^ forward, in original, a letter I have received to-day from the Chief of Bahrein, asking for information regarding the steps taken in the matter of the murder of Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij and his companions. Yesterday evening, at the request of his father, Sheikh Hamad called on me, and informed me thst a party of the Behaih are known to be encamping within striking distance, and asked me for permission to arrange with some friendly Arabs on the mainland to attack them, with a view to avenge the murder of Sheikh Selman. I informed Sheikh Hamad that such an attempt on their part would be most displeasing to the Government of India, and would be harmful to the issue of the negotiations with the Turkish Govern ment; and his father being strictly prohibited from undertaking operations beyond the limits of his own territory, he must refrain from taking any proceedings against the Behaih. The Turkish authorities at Al Hassa have taken no steps towards bring ing the murderers of Sheikh Selman to justice, though they appear to be within their reach. The inactivity of the Turks in this matter is creating a bad impression abroad, the Chief is, therefore, anxious that further pressure be brought to bear by His Majesty’s Government upon the Prote to expedite the settlement of the matter. Translation of a letter from Sheikh Isa-bin-Ali-el-Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein, to the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, dated 13th Rabi-el-Awal 1319 (30th June 1901).

From—The Foreign Secretary, Viceroy’s Camp, Delhi, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to murder of Sheikh Selman and his companions near El Katif in December 1900, it is remarked by Foreign Office that no claim has been made for pecuniary compensation, and it is enquired whether it is intended to claim other satisfaction than punishment of guilty parties. Please ascertain if Bahrein Sheikh would accept pecuniary compensation, and to what amount. Enclosure No. 5. No. 4 S. A., dated Shiraz, the 6th June 1902. From—L ieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, dated 20 th April, on the subject of the murder of Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij-el-Khalifah. 2. So far as the question of pecuniary compensation for the murders is concerned, no claim on this account had hitherto been brought forward by the Chief of Bahrein, whose demand was for the suitable punishment of the- murderers and for the restoration of the property carried off. As the affair occurred in what is considered to be Turkish territory, he expected that the Turkish authorities would afford the redress usual in such cases. Such redress would, I understand, mean the suitable punishment of the murderers, and might include pecuniary compensation or blood-money : in other words, it was expected that the Turkish authorities would take such steps as would satisfy the Chief of Bahrein and the relatives of the murdered persons, and thus settle the blood- feud wffiich has now been brought into existence. 8 . The question of pecuniary compensation has been placed before the Chief of Bahrein, who says that, so far as the murders of Sheikh Selman and the latter’s son and nephew are concerned, he cannot accept pecuniary compen sation. It is against Arab tradition for a Chief to accept blood-money for the murder of members of his family, and as regards these three murders, a settle ment of this nature is not possible. On behalf of the relatives of the other twenty-one Bahrein subjects, who were murdered at the same time, he is willing to accept pecuniary compensation. He says that, where pecuniary compensa tion in such cases is offered and accepted, the customary amount paid is 800 Austrian dollars for each life, ihe blood-money, therefore, for the 21 murdered persons amounts to 16,800 dollars, equivalent, at the present rate of exchange, to Bs. 23,520. On account of the camels and other plundered property, he claims Bs. 11,620, and his total claim, therefore, amounts to Bs. 35,140. On account of the three murdered members of his family above referred to, apparently the Chief requires “ blood for blood ”, and he states that he cannot accept less than the surrender to him of three of the persons implicated in the murder for execution, or possible pardon, if it is besought of him in a proper manner by the Chiefs of the Almurrah tribes. 4. It thus appears that the Chief is willing to accept pecuniary compen sation in partial settlement of the case; but that, for a full and final settlement^ he requires that the murderers should be punished, so that the blood-feud between the Bahaih tribe, to which the murderers belonged, and the El Khalifa family may be at an end. It would, of course, be highly satisfactory if the Turkish Government could be induced to effect a settlement of this nature, that is to say, pay the amount of Bs. 35,140 for the 21 murders and the plun dered property, and also surrender to the Chief of Bahrein three of the mur derers, or otherwise satisfy him on account of the murders of the three members r7 Gained British soon as near El im has ntended seertain mount, it in tie ?d 20th fab. rdersis by the of the e affair hat the redress might pected hief of blood- re the in and mpen- 'or the settle* : other aensa* is 800 ■dered langfii d to, jnnot nthe roper ipen* aent, ,feud 0 [the ;ure, lun* nur* ibers of life family. Judging, however, from the attitude of the Turks so far and ftom the unsatisfactory nature of their authority in the El Fassa district I doubt very much if so satisfactoi^ a settlement can be exp^teFat their hands 5. The Chief of Bahrein has informed the Assistant Political A^ent that he has received a communication from Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Katr to the eltect that the Bahaih tribe have expressed their desire to come to an arrange ment of a nature which will settle the case, and have asked Sheikh Ahmad^o approach the Chief of Bahrein in the matter. The Chief of Bahrein has hitherto refrained from giving Sheikh Ahmad a direct replv, thinking that negotiations with the tribe through him may not he advisable while the discussions in the case are proceeding at Constantinople between His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador and the Turkish Government. If he were to negotiate with the tribe through Sheikh Ahmad, he cannot yet make a definite statement as regards the nature of the settlement which he would make, as he must be guided by the conditions which the Bahaih are willing to accept. He cannot accept less than the surrender to him of three of the implicated persons, and he may leave the families of the other 21 murdered persons to settle their feuds as pest they can if the Bahaih decline to pay blood-money. Of course, if the Chief can obtain the surrender of three of the murderers, it puts him in a position which will enable him to dictate to the tribe ; and even if he cannot obtain full compensation for his murdered subjects, he will be able to effect a settlement which will put a stop to the feud so far as his own family is con cerned. I see no reason, therefore, why the Chief should not proceed to negotiate with the tribe through Sheikh Ahmad, but I do not propose to suggest this course to him, until I receive your further instructions in the ma tter.

The information now obtained by Mr. Gaskin is 'altogether at variance with the recent allegations of the Wali of Basrah. I trust it will enable His Majesty’s Government to press the matter to an issue. No. 135, dated Bahrein, the 11th June 1904 (Confidential). p rom —J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Adverting to correspondence ending with your confidential lette^ No. 358, dated the 15th April 1901, on the subject of the murder of Sheikh Selman-bm- Fiaij and his followers, on the 3rd December 1900, I hare the honour to report; B li t r. that, owing to the fact that the information called for in the 2 nd paragraph of your letter could not be obtained locally and the Chief of Bahrein having had to despatch an Arab to the mainland for the purpose, it could not be furnished earlier. I am informed by the Chief’s messenger that the leaders of the raid were Rashid-bin-Mekarih, Mutib-al-Munnakhas, Mohsin, and Talib, sons of Ali-bin- Noman, nephews of Rashid-bin-Mekarih, and Rashid and Mohsin, sons of Dewairis-al-Hamaidi, also nephews of Rashid-bin-Mekarih; that Rashid-bin- Mekarih and Rashid-bin-Dewairis-al-Hamaidi were killed in the attack on Sheikh Selman, and Mohsin-bin-Dewairis-al-Hamaidi was wounded in the thigh on the same occasion, but subsequently recovered. The other members of the raiding party were Behaih tribesmen, whose names have not yet been procured. As regards the persons mentioned in the communication from the Porte to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, I would venture to report that the only member of the Mekarih family killed by the Turks since the murder, wa&amp; Ibn Retaiban, a nephew of Rashid-bin-Mekarih, on the 10 th September 1902, at Zarnooga, about 11 miles south of Ilofuf. This youth was not concerned in the outrage. Ali-bin-Monakib was a Behaih tribesman, and was killed in the first week of October 1902, in the incident mentioned in the entry, dated 13th October, in this office diary for 18th October 1902. These two men were not concerned in the attack at Tinofa. Ibn Ketifa is also a Behaihi, and is known to be alive and is with his tribe. Muhammad-bin-Nejdan, Hassan Cherimet, and Toritor do not appear to be known as having been members of the Behaih tribe. Though the actual number of the attacking party is unknown, it is generally stated that it was composed of over fifty persons. The fact that two of the leaders were killed in the attack, and possibly five tribesmen may have been subsequently killed in skirmishes with Turkish troops despatched in connection with cases entirely disconnected with the murder of Sheikh Selman and his followers, I cannot see how the Behaih can be considered as exonerated by the Porte, since four of the leaders in the attack and over forty tribesmen are still at large. The contention of the Governor of Nejd to the effect that the crime was due to the animosity existing between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Behaih tribe is erroneous, as will be seen from the data of the case set forth in my letters No. 219, dated 12 th December 1900, and No. 9, dated 27th January 1901. With reference to the question of compensation, it is hoped that the fact that the Rs. 35,140 represent blood-money for the lives of only 21 victims and the value of the camels, arms, and camp equipment taken by the Behaih, and that the Turks will still have to execute three of the principal men concerned in satisfaction of the lives of Sheikh Selman, his son, Diaij, and his nephew, Abdul Rahman-bin-RasMdj for whose murder the Chief cannot accept compensation, as pointed out in my letters Nos. 98 and 109, dated the 3 rd and 17th May 1902, respectively, will not be overlooked. I may mention that the Behaih Arabs are a sub-division of the Murra Arabs, and are not powerful enough to separate themselves from the main tribe, and go into the desert of Nejd for the reason that they would be soon exterminated by the large tribes in that district, and consequently thev have never been beyond the limits of A1 Hassa or Katr, and now the tribe is encamped at Salvva on the western border of Katr. The statement that the tribe has fled into the desert of Nejd is fabricated, with a view to cover the inactivity of the El Hassa authorities. I have duly warned the Chief to take no independent action in the matter. &lt;11904 SIMLA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT NO. 143, DATED THE llTH AlJGtJST 1904. List of Enclosures,1 1904. SIMLA.

It will be seen that Sir N. O'Conor hesitates to act upon the instructions recently sent to him until he hears whether the persons stated to have been killed in the engagement between the Turkish forces and the offending tribe are or are not the same as those accused of the murders. The only information which has been received on this subject is contained in the Note from the Porte enclosed in Sir N. O'Conor's Despatch No.50 of the 26th I Under Secretary of State, India Office. /26th of January last, supplemented by the assertion of the Turkish Minister of the Interior as reported in Sir N. O'Conor's further despatch No.115 of the 23rd of February. Lord Lansdowne notes that both these Despatches have been communicated to the Government of India and that in Mr. Secretary Brodrick’s Despatch No.11 of the 19th of February, in which Sir N. O'Conor's Mo. 50 was inclosed, it was suggested that Colonel Kemball should endeavour to ascertain whether the individuals mentioned in the Turkish note were those actually concerned in the murders. Mo reply ap pears to have been received to this suggestion. It would in Lord Lansdowne’s opinion he desir able to ascertain whether the Sheikh of Bahrein has been made aware of the statement of the Turkish Gov ernment that six members of the offending tribe have been killed, and that besides these six individuals no other person was implicated in the murders. I am to suggest that Colonel Kemball should be request ed to report by telegraph on this point. In the meantime Lord Lansdowne would propose to inform~?€ inform Sir N. 0*Conor ’thaij an ©nQuiry will 'be addres sed to Colonel Kemball as above suggested, but that unless any further information can be obtained from the Sheikh or from the Turkish Government His Excel lency should make the communication to the Porte as directed in Lord Lansdowne's Despatch Mo. 132 of the 12th ultimo.

I hesitate to act on these instructions until I Hear whether the persons who were killed in the engagement of the offending ti ioe wi mi tnc i~rks, are or are not, the same who are accused of the mur- der of the Sheika.

The Minister added however that he trusted that His Majesty's Government would be satisfied with the steps already taken. In view of the language already held to the Turkish Government it does not appear to Lord Lans downe possible to accept this as a solution and His Lordship would now propose to instruct Sir N. O'Conor to inform the Porte that as they have been unable to obtain The Under Secretary of State, India Office.nm—naw — 1 1 m him obtain compensation from the BehaiHis Majesty's Government can no longer dissuade the Sheikh from talcing his own measures; hut that they will use their best efforts to ensure that he shall take no action so long as the Behaih are in territory recog nised as Turkish. At the same time it might be desirable that the British Resident at Bushire should take an oppor tunity of ascertaining whether the Sheikh would be satisfied with the fact that according to the ac count given by the Turkish Government a number of the offending tribe, probably including those responsi ble for the murder, have been killed in an encounter with the Turkish forces. Lord Lansdowne notes that the Government of India have already been informed in the despatch enclosed in your letter of February 27th that no action on the part of the Sheikh can in , any case be permitted until the Behaih move out of Turkish territory. I am. Sir Your most obedient humble ServantCONSTANTINOPLE, February 23rd, 1904. % Lord:- With reference to my despatch No. 50 of the 26th ultimo, respecting the murder of Sheikh Selman I have the honour to report that the Minister of the Interior has informed the Embassy that, in view of a telegram he has received from the Vali of Basra, he finds himself obliged to declare that under the cir cumstances it is quite impossible for the authorities to exact from the tribe to which the murderers belong, the sums demanded by the Sheikh of Bahrein for blood money and the value of the property which was plundered His Excellency went on to say that the local au thorities had already endeavoured to exact blood money from the tribe in question but that their efforts had proved utterly unsuccessful. The tribe were simple nomads and had no property which could be seized, and they had v/ithdrawn into the desert quite beyond the reach of Lansdowne.K.G.&lt;21 reach 01 the authorities. His Excellency also main tained that in a fight which took place at Zernaka between the Turkish troops and Ben Mekiarih and his companions, all of whom belonged to the offending tribe, the presumed murderers of Shiekh Selman and his relatives must have all perished. The Minister consequently hoped that His Majesty's Government would be good enough to consider this question as definitely settled. I let His Excellency know that I would convey 1 his request to His Majesty’s Government, but that I was unable to express an opinion as to whether his contentions would be considered satisfactory. I have &amp;c.. (Signed) N. R. O’Conor.I am directed dy the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you to he laid before the Secretary of State for India copy of a despatch from His Maj esty^ Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject of the steps being to.ken to obtain compensation for the murder of Sheikh Selman of Bahrein which was received while your letter of January 27th was under cons i de rat i on. It appears to Lord Lansdowne desirable to afford the Turkish Government this final- opportunity of settling the question and he would therefore recom mend that the result of the instructions sent to the Vali of Basrah should be awaited. $* I am accordingly to suggest that the Political * -i Resident should, on the occasion of his visit to Bahrein, inform the Sultan of the steps which have been The Under Secretary of State, India Office.been taken and endeavour to ascertain whether the nersons mentioned by the Turkish Government are those actually concerned in the murder. In t} ie event ol the Turkish Government failing to obtain payment of an adequate compensation or ci their resorting to further procrastination Lord Lanedowne would be prepared no agree ^o the pro posal that the Sheikh should be permitted to take his own measures for exacting reparation. It would however be necessary to take precautions oc avoid raising, so far as possible, the question of Turkish sovereignty in these regions. In your letter of September 23rd it was sug gested that in order to minimise this difficulty the Sheikh should exact reparation from the Behaih, if the necessity arises for such a course, during their annual sojourn on the coast where Turkish sovereignty is not recognised by His Majesty’s Gov ernment. This appears to Lord Lansdowne to be the best course, and it will have the further advantageof affording time for the promised action of the Turkish Authorities as the Behaih do not apparently come down to the coast until the summer months. For these reasons it would he desirahle that the Resident should inform the Sheikh that His Majesty's Government would not in any event he prepared to allow him to take measures against the Behaih while they are still in the interior within Turkish juris diction.

My Lord: - With reference to my despatch No. 679 of 16th October last, respecting the murderers of Sheikh Selrnan of Bahrein, I have the honour to transmit here with copy of a communication from the Porte giving the further particulars which were promised with regard to the punishment alleged to have been inflicted on the offending tribe. I cannot find that the reports we have received have ever furnished the names of the men who committed the murders and I am therefore unable to say whether any of the persons named by the Porte are the real culprits. I have however let the Ottoman Government know that reparation in the form of blood-money in accordance Che Marquess of Lansdowne, K. G., &amp;C. , cX&gt;C. , &lt;3tC.accordance with the prescriptions of the Sheri law is absolutely necessary and a memorandum, of v/hich I have the honour to enclose a translation, was pre sented by the Embassy dragoman to the Minister of the Interior claiming the sum of Rupees 23,520 as blood- money and Rupees 11,620 - the value of camels and ' other property plundered - in all Rupees 35,140. I The Minister of the Interior stated in reply I' 1 i that in his opinion it would be almost impossible to exact from the tribe to which the murderers belong so large a sum, - the more so as they are nomads who have no property which could be seized or sold. Nevertheless His Excellency taking into consider ation the importance attached by His Majesty's Governnent to this matter telegraphed the substance of the memorandum to the Vali of Basra and instructed him to take action accordingly. His Excellency was at the same time assured that I would request His Majesty's Governnent to forbear from encouraging the Sheikh of Bahrein to take the matter into his own handshands until a reasonable time had elapsed during which the Vali could endeavour to execute the orders sent him. I have, &amp;c. , (Signed) N. R. 0*Conor.opy / Substance or Prornemoria 'In the opinion of His Majesty's Ambassador, the question of the murder of Sheikh Selrnan and his rela tions cannot be definitely settled unless blood-money, the payment of which is in conformity with the pre scriptions of the Sheri Law, should be also exacted. The persons who had perished in the encounter with the tribe to which the murderers belong do not actually ^ exceed five or six individuals while it has been as certained that the number of Bahreinis who were killed amounted to twenty-four men. 'Whereas, according to the prescriptions of the Sheri and Civil Laws, it is necessary that an indemnity should be claimed in favour of the latter, His Majes- i ty's Embassy tnerefore, according to the demand made ,&gt; by the Sheikh of Bahrein, begs now to state that it is necessary that the sum of Rupees 23,520 should be paid as blood-money for the persons killed above-mentioned, and that the amount of Rupees 11,620 being the value of camels and other property plundered on that occasionoccasion should also he paid. These two suras amount to a total of Rupees 35,140 which should he exacted from the said trihe and paid to the heirs of the vic tims. 'The Sheikh of Bahrein has often declared to the British Resident that he is in a position to have this matter locally and properly settled without having recourse to the intervention of the Turkish author ities; hut as the question forms at present the sub ject of negotiations between the Sublime Porte and His Majesty's Embassy, no favourable answer was, as yet, given to this demand of the Sheikh of Bahrein'.- ^ ^ '''' Me J r,vate Secretary to the Parlmmevtary Under Secretary of State.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 1340 E.-A., dated 4th July 1902, with enclosures, on the subject of the murder of Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij-el-Khalifah. 2.

It is evident that the blood-feud of the Behaih was with the Amamerah and not with the Dawasir tribe, and that this feud was settled by Sheikh Eashid, Chief of the Behaih tribe. Further, it appears that there was no blood-feud between the Behaih and Dawasir tribes, that the Dawasir and Amamerah tribes are not inter-connected, and that Sheikh Selman’s party had nothing to do with the Dawasirs. The attack was made on Sheikh Selman’s camp and not upon the Dawasirs : the Sheikh of the Dawasirs was not killed, and of the attacking side only three were killed, and not thirteen as stated by the Turkish Minister. 3. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter, I do not think that any complications will occur should Sheikh Ahmed undertake the role of peace maker between the Chief of Bahrein and the Behaih tribe. No. 178, dated Bahrein, the 24th August 1902 (Confidential). From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Perssian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 623, dated the 16th August 1902, forwarding a copy of Government of India’s letter No. 1340 E.-A., dated the 4th July 1902, together with copies of despatch No. 217, dated lOthMay 1902, from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and of a translation of a communique of the Turkish Minister of the Interior to the Turkish Foreign Minister, on the subject of the murder of Sheikh Selman and his companions. I would venture to report that the suppositions of the Turkish Minister of the Interior are incorrect and misleading, and the facts of the case have been arranged in a manner to show that the subjects of the Chief of Bahrein were the original aggressors, which is contrary to the facts, and the sequence of occurrences are as follows :—In 1898, four Amamerah tribesmen accompanied a party of Dawasirs to Thahran to hunt, and the two parties went down the coast below Ojair where the Amamerah separated to go after gazelle, and were attacked by four Behaih Arabs who killed one of them named Abdulla-bin-Muhammad and wounded two named Muhammad and Eashid, sons of Majid, and took their rifles. In the following year the two sons of Majid mentioned above and another named Ghaith-bin-Bashid of the same tribe crossed over with two others to hunt and to look out for any Behaih tribesmen, and they fell in with some grazing camels attended by a young son of Sheikh Easbid-bin-Megarih, Sheikh of Behaih, and they took the opportunity to kill the boy in the place of Abdulla-bin-Muhammad. It will be seen from these facts that the Dawasirs have no blood-feud with the Behaih to adjust. After the assassination of the son of Sheikh Eashid, the latter came over to Bahrein and made a settlement with Sheikh Hamed, the eldest son of the Chief of Bahrein, to put aside all further hostilities between him and the Amamerahs.No Amamerahs accompanied Sheikh Selman on the hunting expedition which proved so disastrous to himself and his followers; and the fact that the camp of the Dawasirs which was close to his was not attacked by the Behaih shows that the latter’s object w T as not the Dawasirs. The Amamerahs are a distinct tribe, and have no connection whatever with the Dawasirs, and live in a separate village near the Dawasirs at A1 Bidda on the north-west corner of the Island of Bahrein. Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Hassan, the Chief of the Dawasir, was not killed in the attack on Sheikh Selman, hut another Dawasir. Sheikh Abdulla is still alive, and is personally known to me. The Dawasirs are subjects of the Chief ot Bahrein. Bashid-bin-Megarih, the Chief of the Behaih, and his second son and a Behaih tribesman only were killed by a slave of Sheikh Selman in the attack on the latter and his party, and not thirteen persons as stated by the Turkish Minister of the Interior. The Almurra, Ajman and two Beni Hajir, companions who went with Sheikh Selman and lost their lives in the attack, were killed by the Behaih, and therefore must not be included in the number of the persons killed by the party attacked. There was no connection whatever between the party of the late Sheikh Selman and that of the Dawasir tribe. The simultaneous crossing of the two parties to the mainland was a mere coincidence, as that is the usual season for such parties to cross over for the purpose of hawking the “ hubara It will be observed that the Behaih were the original aggressors against the Amamerahs whose blood-feud was finally settled amicably, and subsequently the Behaih without any cause attacked the late Sheikh Selman and his party starting a fresh blood-feud. As explained in previous correspondence, accord ing to tribal custom, it is only the section of the tribe a member of which sheds blood is responsible, and not the inhabitants of a whole district, as it would seem the Turkish Minister desires to imply. In this case the Behaih assas sinated 24 persons belonging to Bahrein, and if a balance is struck, there are 21 lives to be accounted for by the Behaih, but the Behaih being undoubtedly the aggressors, it seems contrary to justice to allow any deduction being made when settling the matter. The Chief of Bahrein tells me that he cannot accept blood-money for the lives of the three members of his family; and, if peace is to be established between him and the Behaih, the only means to be adopted are those mentioned in the third paragraph of my letter No. 109, dated 17th May 1902. As Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani would be acting as a peace maker between the two parties, I do not see what complications can arise in the future. r I have made careful enquiries regarding the sub-divisions of the A1 Murra tribe, and I am informed that neither the Al Murra nor any other tribe in the Al Hassa or Katr districts include a section named Elbidj amongst its sub-divisions. if Commi' Under63 .—From Viceroy, Qth October 1902. V.-Please see KembalVs letter of Qth June, enclosed with Foreign Secretary's of 10th July, in connection with your Despatch of 21th June. Do you object to Sheikh of Bahrein being authorised to negotiate through Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani of Katr, with Behaih tribe, respecting the murder of his subjects near Kateef. Tinless he is to be allowed to seek his revenge by force, this seems to be the only means of gaining redress. The account of the incident given by the Turkish Minister of the Interior is altogether inaccurate, see letter from Kemball of Qth September, of which a copy goes by next mail.No. 4 S. A., dated Shiraz, the 6th June 1902. From Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, dated 20 th April, on the subject of the murder of Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij-el-Khalifah. 2 . So far as the question of pecuniary compensation for the murders is concerned, no claim on this account had hitherto been brought forward by the Chiet ot Bahrein, whose demand was for the suitable punishment of the murderers and for the restoration of the property carried off. As the affair occurred m what is considered to be Turkish territory, he expected that the iurkisk authorities would afford the redress usual in such cases. Such redress would, I understand, mean the suitable punishment of the murderers and mio'ht include pecuniary compensation or blood-money : in other words, it was expected that the lurkish authorities would take such steps as would satisfy the Chief of Bahrein and the relatives of the murdered persons, and thus settle the blood- teud which has now been brought into existence. 3. The question of pecuniary compensation has been placed before the Chief of Bahrein, who says that, so far as the murders of Sheikh Selman and the latter’s son and nephew are concerned, he cannot accept pecuniary compen sation. It is against Arab tradition for a Chief to accept blood-money for the murder of members of his family, and as regards these three murders a settle ment of this nature is not possible. On behalf of the relatives of the other twenty-one Bahrein subjects, who were murdered at the same time, he is willino* to accept pecuniary compensation. He says that, where pecuniary compensa” tion in such cases is offered and accepted, the customary amount paid is 800 Austrian dollars for each life. The blood-money, therefore, for the 21 murdered persons amounts to 16,800 dollars, equivalent at the present rate of exchange to R.s. 23,520. On account of the camels and other plundered property, he claims Bs. 11,620, and his total claim, therefore, amounts to Its. 35,140. ^On account of the three murdered members of his family above referred to, apparently the Chief requires “ blood for blood”, and he states that he cannot accept less than the surrender to him of three of the persons implicated in the murder for execution or possible pardon, if it is besought of him in a proper manner by the Chiefs of the A1 Murrah tribes. 1 4. It thus appears that the Chief is willing to accept pecuniary compen sation in partial settlement of the case, but that, for a full and final settlement he requires that the murderers should be punished, so that the blood-feud between the Behaih tribe to which the murderers belonged and the El Khalifah family may be at an end. It would, of course, be highly satisfactory if the Turkish Government could be induced to effect a settlement of this nature that is to say, pay the amount of Es. 35,140 for the 21 murders and the plun dered property, and also surrender to the Chief of Bahrein three of the mur derers, or otherwise satisfy him on account of the murders of the three members of his family. Judging, however, from the attitude of the Turks so far and from the unsatisfactory nature of their authority in the El Hassa district, I doubt very much if so satisfactory a settlement can be expected at their hands. 5. The Chief of Bahrein has informed the Assistant Political Agent that he has received a communication from Sheikh Ahmad-bin-Thani of Katr, to the effect that the Behaih tribe have expressed their desire to come to an arrange ment of a nature which will settle the case, and have asked Sheikh Ahmad to approach the Chief of Bahrein in the matter. The Chief of Bahrein has hitherto refrained from giving Sheikh Ahmad a direct reply, thinking that negotiations with the tribe through him may not be advisable while the discussions in the case are proceeding at Constantinople between His Britannic- ;■ r- ^ Majesty’s Ambassador and the Turkish Government. If he were to negotiate with the tribe through Sheikh Ahmad, he cannot yet make a definite statement as regards the nature of the settlement which he would make, as he must be guided by the conditions which the Behaih are willing to accept. He cannot accept less than the surrender to him of three of the implicated persons, and he may leave the families of the other 21 murdered persons to settle their feuds as best they can if the Behaih decline to pay blood-money. Of course, if the Chief can obtain the surrender of three of the murderers, it puts him in a position which will enable him to dictate to the tribe; and even if he cannot obtain full compensation for his murdered subjects, he will be able to effect a settlement which will put a stop to the feud so far as his own family is concerned. I see no reason, therefore, why the Chief should not proceed to negotiate with the tribe through Sheikh Ahmad, but I do not propose to suggest this course to him until I receive your further instructions in the matter.-jg? mam Conf i c ^ntial . /I ( Copy ) No. 13^0—Z/k. ^ 2 . r rom To ihe Deputy secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign .epartraent, Lieutenant Colonel C.n.Remball, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf , 3hiraz.

I have &amp;C., (Signed) N. R. O'Conor.Lit:Translation of a communication from the Minist of the Interior to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated May 3rd, 1902. The son of Rashid bin Mekiarikh, Chief of the Elbidj section of the Almareh tribe was murdered in tne year 1315 (1899), by the Devassir tribe of the Island of Bahrein. In the year 1316 (1900) the son of Sheikh Selman, one of the Sheikhs of Bahrein, pro- ceeded to Maakdan in the neighbourhood of Katif on a shooting expedition, together with Abdallah bin Hassan of tne Devassir tribe, and in consequence of the mur der of Rashid bin Mekiarikh, the tribes (in that neighbourhood) in accordance with the custom of ven detta attacked the Bahrelnese and killed over twenty of them. The British Embassy asked that the assassin of Sheikh Selman, together with his accomplices, should be seized and punished. In consequence a lengthy correspondence has passed between the Porte and. the Vilayet of Basra, and the Vali sends now the copy of a joint report received by him from the Mutessarlfand. the Military Commandant of Nejd. According to this report when Sheikh Selman, his son and the Sheikh of the Devassir tribe, Abdullah bin Hassan, without appealing, as they should have done, to the Caimacan ofkatif, were in that neighbourhood, be cause Sheikh Abdullah aforesaid of the tribe of Devassir had killed the son of Rashid bin Meklarikh, Rashid, in order to avenge the death of his son, to gether with his followers, attacked them. A bat tle took place in which fourteen Bahreinese were J •'killed; Selman bin Beidj, the cousin of Sheikh Issa of Bahrein, and his son Deidj-bin Selman, his nephew Abdurrahman bin Rashid, and of the Devassir Sheikhs Abdullah bin Hassan, were among the killed. Thirteen of the Hasa and Katif tribe were also killed, and among them were the head of the attack ing party, Rashid bin Mekiarikh and his son. In the letter addressed by the Sheikh Issa of Bahrein to the Mutessarif of Nejd, it was alleged that 9,376 reals worth of property was taken from t.ne Bahreinese; this claim seemed to be much exag geratedexaggerated, more especially as the carrying of Mar tinis is prohibited by the Government; (I presume tne Mutessarif means the value of the arms lost cannot be properly claimed (initialled a.B.) ) if the prop erty is estimated at its real value, it will be pos sible to extract this money from the Elbidj tribe. As a matter of fact the whole affair is the con sequence of the murder of the son of Sheikh Rashid bin Mekiarikh by the Devassir tribe, and is the usual vendetta to which the tribes always resort. On this occasion it is the Bahreinese who have been the cause of the occurrence; without appealing to the Govern ment they ought not to have gone shooting in that li' If district: such a proceeding was irregular. Gr irnes committed in this manner in the desert are to be ex piated by tne punishment of the instigators; such is the law Chapter I §2; yet notwithstanding Sheikh Rashid, the head, of the raid, and his son have been shot, in law the death of the accused stops proceed ings: if it be necessary, however, to settle the question according to tribal custom, and if one com parescompares the losses sustained on both sides, and the fact that the Bahreinese were the original ag gressors, the Bahreinese at most can only ask for their fourteen dead 800 reals each. The Elbidj tribe has not since this incident come into the neighbourhood of El Hasa, but nevertheless one of the Sheikhs of the tribe, Abdullah bin Tafio has been seized and imprisoned. The answer returned by the Ministry of the Interior to the V a li is that I as, according to the information thus given. Sheikh Rashid, the head of the raid and his son have been killed, and of his followers ten or thirteen have been also killed, it is therefore impossible to punish or prosecute anyone. The real value of the property taken should be assessed, and with the bloodrnoney due to the Bahreinese killed should be taken from the other tribe, and in accordance with tribal custom, you should settle the matter in this manner and pacify the two parties.

British Residency and Consulate General, Bushire,2nd April 1902. ^’rom ft .202 Lieut-Colonel C•AoKemball, DEg g Offg Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To H*S.Barnes,Esquire,C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department,Simla, Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to my letter No.33, dated the 17th February,on the subject of the murder of Sheikh Sal man bin Diaij el Kiialifah, and to report that I have been carefully considering the question of the possibility of obtaining redress for the Chief of Bahrein in the event of no satisfactory settlement ^ , being made by the Turks. 2. The offending tribe is,I understand,a strong one and possesses a large number of camels.The members of the tribe are Nomad s and have no fixed place of residence.During the Winter and Spring tney camp on the southern confines of A1 Hassa.and for about three months of the Summer they move to the wells situated about 8 miles inland of Duhat Salwa which is shown on the chart due south of Bahrein and is in Katr.A boat expedition from one of His Majesty's snips against the tribe would not be possible. 3. Shaikh Jassim el Thani could,I believe,arrange to punish the tribe and to obtain redress for the Chief of Bahrein,but it is Shaikh Jassim's settled policy to encourage the Bedouins and give them a safe haven in Katr,so as to be sure of their support in time of need.He would probably only agree to punish trie Beham if we agreed to turn the Turks out of A1 Bidda and to take trie whole or Katr under our protection.The question therefore of the Sheikh Jassiassistance'^n the matter cannot be considered. 4. The Chief of Bahrein, if giveii a free hand, would probably arrange,by subsidizing some other Bedouin tribe living in the vicinity,to obtain some sort of reparation from the Behaih.lt is robable however that such a measure would be unsatisfactory ,as the Ch'J'ief might have to give the tribe who would thus have taken his quarrel upon themselves a place of haven in Bahrein and this would prove a constant drain on his resources. 5. I have lately received a report from the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to the effect that Shaikh Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab who lately returned to Bahreinl^rom Al Hassa informed him that when he was at Al Hassa the Mutassarif showed him a strong^worded tele gram from the Minister of the Interior to the Wali of Bussorah directing him to cause the arrest and punishment of the murderers and stating that if he failed in carrying out the orders the matter would be brought before the Council of Ministers,Still stronger commands on the subject had been subscribed on tne document by the Wali to the Mu|tassarif.The above has been confirmed by infor mation received from His Majesty's Consul at Bussorah and it is to be hoped that some action will at last be taken by the Turns. 6. If no action is taken ,I can only suggest that the Gnief of Bahrein should be advised to stop transhipment at Bahrein of cargo destined for Katif and Ojair and prohibit trade with those ports until justice is done to him.Such a course would affect the Tur kish Customs and inconvenience the whole of the mercantile communi ty of the two places who would probably induce the Mutassarif to take early action. It would also affect the trade of Bahrein though though in a less degree.The suggestion may not be entirely satis factory but I can think of no other to make at present / and it is at any rate worthy of consideration in case His Majesty's Government^ has seen fit to inform the hrte that the Chief of Bahrein will be ^ allowed to take his own steps to obtain redress if no effective action is taken by the Turks within a reasonable time. I have ,etc., Sd. C.A.Kemball. Offg Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. -No. 33, dated Bushire, the 17th February 1902 (Confidential). From— Liiutenakt-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to invite a reference to your letter No. 1803 E.-A., dated 21st October 1901, regarding the murder of Sheikh Selman-bin-Diayel Khalifa and others of Bahrein, and to report that, in accordance with the request made by me to the Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf, H. M. S. “ Sphinx” visited El-Katif on the 2nd Eebruary for the purpose of enquiring from the local Turkish authorities what action had been taken to punish the perpetrators of the outrage. It will be seen from the report submitted to me by the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, copy of which is herewith forwarded, that the visit of the “ Sphinx” did not produce any satisfactory result, as, indeed, it was hardly expected that it would. Whether it will have the indirect result of inducing the Turkish officials to take any action, it is too early as yet to judge. It is possible, however, that the fact of H. M. S. “ Sphinx” having visited Katif and failed to obtain any satisfactory reply from the Turkish officials, as also the decidedly discourteous attitude of the local authorities towards the Commander and Assistant Political Agent, may give His Majesty’s Government an oppor tunity of making further representations to the Porte in the matter. It may, perimps, be advisable to warn the Porte that, unless satisfactory assurances are civen that steps will be taken to obtain redress, we shall have no option but to allow the Chief of Bahrein to undertake measures of retaliation on the offending tribe. No. 16, dated Bahrein, the 6 th February 1902 (Confidential). p rom _J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential office indorsement No. 15, dated the 6 th January 1902, which reached this office on he 27th ultimo via Karachi. H M S “ Sphinx” called at Bahrein on the 1st instant, and, in accordance vith vour 'instructions, I accompanied Captain Kemp on the following morning , 0 Has Tanoora, which was reached on the same day at 2 r.M. On the arrival )f the “ Sphinx” at the anchorage mentioned, the tide was found to be unfavoui- ible and the visit to the Kaim Makam of Katif had to be put off tiU the ollowing morning. At about 8 p.m. that evening, an official sent by the Nairn boarded H. M. S. “ Sphinx” to make the usual enquiries as to the reasons or the vessel calling in those waters, and he was informed to the effect that *e had come from Bahrein, and requested him to convey our compliments to he Kaim Makam and inform him that we would call on him in the morning. We started at 7-30 a.m. on Monday for Katif, taking the channel round he northern side of Taroot Island, and subsequent to our departure a quarantine iffieer*hoarded the “ Sphinx”, and finding that we had left followed us up and old us thM there was quarantine against all arrivals, and if we had any corn- old us tnat tiicre q Ma g am) we had better do it m writing, and numcationto make shou i d have been communicated on the previous le was told the info purpose. On nearing the town, we light and we could not turn back tr stem about a mile above it and wade bund the water so fallow that we “ ^Xys ^erc obtained to take us to or half the distance on a f r y “^soldiers who attempted to repel - letained us at a hut which they said was the custom house.we We disembarked and walked up to the Kaim Makam’s house, where were received with a guard of honour (?) who presented arms, and the Kaim Makam with nine members of the Municipal Council at the entrance. After the exchange of the usual greetings, Captain Kemp expressed his regrets at the manner in which we were treated, and in reply the Kaim Makam pretended that he had no information before we reached the town about the ship’s arrival, and as it was unusual for a foreign ship of war to call there, they did not know what to do, and hoped we would overlook the matter. Captain Kemp then informed him the reasons of our visit, and advised him to permit those whom he did not desire to hear the conversation to take their leave. The Kaim Makam took us to an adjacent chamber and called in the members of the Council, and the enquiries regarding the steps taken by the Turkish authorities in the cases mentioned in your letter No. 1348, dated the 27th December 1901, to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, were made. To all the questions put to him by Captain Kemp, the Kaim Makam replied to the effect that the officer during whose incumbency the murder and piracies occurred was away on leave, and as he himself had only been acting in the post for about fifteen days, he consequently knew nothing of the cases or what has been done in them. He also remarked that in such matters he believed that it w r as usual for a Poreign Government to refer their cases to the Porte and have orders issued to the Governor-General of the locality in which they occur, and in this instance Captain Kemp had better write to him on the subject, when he would transmit it on to the Mutasarif of A1 Hasa for orders. Captain Kemp told him that he would report his replies to his Government, and requested that in the meantime he would communicate with the Mutasarif of A1 Hasa as early as possible and obtain information relative to the cases m question. A The Kaim Makam sent an agent, named Mohamed Beg, having the civil rank of Beem Beshi, to make enquiries about our visit, and told us to send a ^ written communication of what we had to say to the Kaim Makam. Captain r ^ Kemn informed him that he had much to communicate, and owing to the long distance the ship was anchored from Katif, it was impossible to carry on corre spondence with any despatch, and he must see the Kaim Makam without delay, After an hour’s detention, the Agent returned and attempted further evasions, and Captain Kemp strongly protested at the behaviour of the Kami Makam, and demanded an immediate reply as to whether he would give him an audience or not, and, if it was a question of quarantine, to be definitely informed as to the number of days the vessel had to do. The Agent did not return, and after waiting for him about two hours, Captain Kemp sent another message by the officer of the soldiers, who were attending to us, and getting no reply, a feint was made to leave, and when we got into our boat and put off, a messenger arrived in haste, stating that the Kaim Makam wished to see us and hoped we would return. The Kaim Makam was very reticent regarding the attitude of the Arabs in the district, and declared that all was quiet and orderly. After our interview with the Kaim Makam, we attempted to return to H. M. S. “ Sphinx ”, but the condition of the tide did not allow of our boat to cross the ford about half a mile above the town, and we had to return to Katif and asked the Kaim Makam for shelter. A room on the ground floor was allotted to us in the office of the shipping master, on the upper story of which a small detachment of soldiers in charge of treasure for the pay of the troops in Katr, were quartered. The Kaim Makam sent us a dinner and some bedding, and on the following morning he also gave us some breakfast in the same quarters. As we had to wait for the tide to rise high enough to allow of our boat passing the bar at the ford, Captain Kemp desired to see the bazar and was prevented from doing so by the guard placed over us. We left Katif at about 1-30 p.m. on Tuesday, and had to beat out against the wind for about half of the distance to the ship which was reached at 6-15 p.m. H. M. S. “Sphinx” left lias Tanoora at 8-15 a.m. and arrived here at 1*30 p.m. , uodef 0 rioispson Tfl 0It will bB observed from the foregoing report that we were treated bv the Turkish authorities m an improper manner, and the unwarrantable delays' and ostentatious excuses offered by the Kaim Makam, and the indignity offered us ^ by confinement first in the custom house and then in the shipping master’s •Ti office under a guard, I consider ought not to be overlookeed, and he stron°fv protested against at the Porte with a view to obtaining proper treatment Yf British officers when visiting Turkish ports in the future. The Kaim Makam who is personally known to me, sent me a private message by an Arab Nakhoda taken with us for local knowledge that he knew that our rank deserved better treatment which he was unable to extend owing to the fear of beino 1 accused by his enemies as being in collusion with us, and hoped we would not blame him for it, and from this it would seem that the authorities knew full well what they were doing. foreign Offioo Press— No. 2?3— 13*3-02—45.i No. 34), dated Busliire, the 17th February 1902 (Confidential).

In continuation of this office confidential letter No. 16, dated the 6 th February 1902, I have the honour to submit the following information which I was able to gather on my recent visit regarding the district of Katif. The inhabited portion of the district is confined within the part taken up by the vast date plantations extending about fourteen miles along the shore and three miles inland. The island of Tarut which forms part of the Kaim Makamia, which lies about a mile and-a-half away and parallel with the shore, is connected with the mainland by a ford dry at low water at about half-a-mile above the Katif Fort, is also covered with date plantations, and is about four and-a-half mile long by three and half. In the margin are given the names of nineteen villages on the mainland and the four in the island, north. All the villages, except those in the The population of the whole district is estimated at 40,000 souls, and turn out about 4,000 fighting men mostly armed with modern rifles. Katif proper is known as the Kelat, and is entirely surrounded by date trees, except on a small portion on the west side where a dilapidated fort with walls twenty feet high is visible. The population of the town is stated to be about 7,000. The revenue obtained by the Turks is estimated at 12,000 Turkish Liras annually. The Turks have about sixty infantry and forty cavalry stationed in the district and distributed in the villages. There are no field batteries or modern cannon, and the only cannon kept for the protection of Katif are two brass and a large number of iron muzzle-loaders of ancient type, for which a large quantity of ball is kept in stock at Katif and Damam, but the supply of powder is said to be insignificant. The approaches to Katif by water are difficult, and that round the northern end of Tarut island can only be navigated at high water by vessels drawing under five feet, and at low water small boats may only approach to within a mile. The proper channel is to the south of the town, but only navigable for boats drawing not more than six feet. Katif is in postal communication with Basrah via A1 Hasa, to which the carrier takes 24 hours and caravans three days. From A1 Hasa to Basrah, the post takes about seven days. them in order from the island, are protected by walls.3 ^ \ FOREIGN OFFICE March 8th, 1902.

His Excellency the Wali asks for information and exhorts the Chief to refrain from retaliation, and the Acting Mutasarif wants to know the whereabouts of the murderers and calls for a list showing the value or the articles that were stolen. ^ T 1 l? !?j ef k as informe(1 His Excellency that he has submitted all the facts to the British Government through whose officers no doubt His Excellency has already heard them, and that no hostilities will take place if the Ottoman Gov ernment punish the offenders and recover the stolen property. He has told the Acting Matasarif that he is not aware of the whereabouts of the Behaih, and has complied with his request as regards the plundered property. It appears from the communications received by the Chief that the Ottoman Government intend to take serious action in the matter of punishing the murderers and the recovery of the value of the lost articles. If the Government, however, fail to do anything, I think that the whole matter may he settled by the payment of an indemnity of about Es. 30,000. J Translation of a letter from the Wali of Basrah, to Sheikh Isa-bin-Ali, Chief of Bahrein, dated the 26th Ramzan 1318. Jfter compliments.—According to news which has reached me from the Mutasarif of Nejd, Selman, one of the Sheikhs of Bahrein, his son and Abdulla Sheikh of the Dowasir with 70 followers, who had gone on the 20 th Tashrin- ul-Thani to Ma-i-Akdan on a hunting excursion, were attacked at night by Sheikh Bashid, Chief of the Almurra tribe, and Selman with his son and 23 followers was murdered, and in the same outrage Bashid and his son were killed. You are aware that, if this incident is allowed to pass unheeded, it will develop into a serious one, and loss of lives and bloodshed between the Islams will ensue, which is not pleasing to God. I request you to take steps to prevent such an incident, and to furnish me with details of the case.Translation of a letter from Sheikh Isa-bin-Ali-al-Khalifah, to His Excellency Mohsin Pasha, Wall of Basrah, dated 12th Dil Kada 1318 (4th March 1901). Af er compliments .—I received your letter, dated the 26th Ramzan, on the 8 th instant, requesting me tp acquaint you with the facts °f the murder of my cousin Selman-bin-Diaij, his son Diaij and his nephew Ahdul Rahman-bm- Rashid with 22 followed and the wounding of 2. The details of this outrage were communicated by me to the High (British) Government, and Your Excellency has no doubt made inquiries from its representative in your territory. I have done nothing displeasing to God in this affair, and you request me to prevent a similar incident. I trust that through the High (Turkish) Government and your good offices, punishment will be meted out to the perpetrators ot the murders, so that the hearts of all may rejoice and the stolen articles recovered. Translation of a letter from the Commandant and Agent to the Mutasarif of Nejd, to Sheikh Isa-bin-Ali-al-Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein, dated 18th Shawal 1310 (Turkish 16th Kanun-al-Thani 1316). After compliments .—I transmit to you a letter which has been received from the Walayet of Basrah concerning you in connection with the murder of Selman and his followers who had gone to Dahran on a shooting excursion. It is well known that the authorities (Turkish) _ have not been inactive, since the time the outrage was committed, in investigating the matter, but are endeavouring to capture the murderers and to recover the stolen articles. Through the shadow of the Sultan I sincerely hope that the men will ^ be seized, whether they be far away or near, and that the rifles recovered. In view of your friendship, it is necessary that you take steps to prevent an incident which would be displeasing to God and the Sultan, and to avoid an outrage similar to the one which has occurred and which, since the time it took place, has deprived me of peace. As I have received no particulars from you regarding the incident, I request you to inform me in what direction you think the murderers are, and what is the nature and quantity of the articles that were looted, so that I may comply with the orders conveyed to me, and that I may reply to the letter I have received. I pray to God that the steps which are being taken will prevent the occurrences of like outrages, which are the cause of anxiety to you. I also request you to send me your reply to the Basrah letter, so that I may forward it on.

You desire me to inform you what articles were robbed in the incident in which my cousin Selman-bin-Diaij, his son Diaij and his nephew Abdul Rahman-bin-Rashid with his friends and servants were murdered. It is known to you that on account of this outrage and murders I have addressed the High (British) Government. A list of the articles which were stolen is herewith enclosed. The outrage was committed by the A1 Behyeh section of the Almurra tribe, the whereabouts of whom are unknown to me.

With refersnce to my letter of the 18th ultimo, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to trans mlt to you a copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople on the question of ob- of the Almurra tribe on a party of Bahreinese at El Derya, South of El Katlf, in December last. Government have hitherto declined to recognize Tur kish suzerainty over the country to the South of El Katif, and have exacted punishment for piracies com mitted on the coast of that region without communi cating with the Turkish Government, although there has been for many years a Turkish garrison at El Bidaa on that coast. His Excellency considers it probable that a demand by His Majesty's Government for the punish- taining reparation for the attack made by members The Under Secretary of State India Office. mentpunishment by the Turkish Government of the persons guilty of the outrage on the Bahreinese will be look ed upon by the Porte as implying an admission of the Sultan's suzerainty over the country to the South of El Katif. He also doubts whether the Turkish forces at El Katif and El Bidaa would be able to deal success fully with the Alrnurra tribe. Sir N. O'Conor however sees no serious objection to making representations to the Turkish Government in regard to this matter, if care is taken to avoid as far as possible the question of suzerainty over the coast. Lord Lansdowne is prepared, if the Secretary of State for India concurs, to authorize Sir N. O'Conor to make a representation to the Turkish Government in regard to the attack on the Bahreinese,avoiding any acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty and simply requesting that instructions may be given to the Turkish Authorities in Arabia to take such measures as3opy. \Io.81. U J CONSTANTINOPLE. February 27th, 1901. My Lo rd: - After careful consideration of the enclo- n sures in Your Lordsliip s despatch No.36of the 16th instant, I have the honour to offer the following observations on the question of obtaining reparation for the recent attack of the Almurra tribe on certai relatives of the Sheikh of Bahrein and their party. The outrage seems to have occurred to the South of El Katif down to which the Turkish Government- have been informed that their suzerainty is not dis puted and within the country described to the Turkish Foreign Minister by Sir Clare Ford in 1893 as debate- able land, jiie have hitherto declined to recognise Turkish suzerainty over this stretch of country, and we have exacted punishment for piracies along the Coast in question without giving notice to Turkey, although there has been for many years a Turkish gar rison he Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., * &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., /)garrison at El Bidaa the most important place on If we now call upon Turkey to punish the Al- murra tribe it is probable that our demand will be construed by them as implying an admission of their suzerainty to the South of El Katif though I should endeavour to treat the matter in such a manneip as to avoid any explicit mention of the question of suzerainty over the coast and repel any attempt to question our protectorate over Bahrein or of our right to protect Bahreinese within the Ottoman dominions jo n both of which points the Ottoman Gov ernment have been repeatedly informed of our Inten tions. I feel pretty sure that the Ottoman Government will make fair promises and probably even take such steps as may be in their power to punish the cul prits but their forces at Katif and El Bidaa are not probably sufficient to enable them to pursuethe Almurra tribe into their desert fastnesses and I remember how utterly they failed in the case of the outrage at Dieddah in 1895 and doubt whether they are likely to be more successful in this instance, but I see no objection to making representations to the Ottoman Government and I consider that whatever steps we may ultimately be forced to take we ought not to exact reparation on our own account or allow the Bahreinese Chief to do so without previously warning the Ottoman Government especially as the Almurra tribe live apparently, some distance in the interior. I ought to add that I understand from a private letter from Mr. Wratislaw that he has already pre sented a complaint on the subject to the Vali of Basrah. I propose however to await further instruc tions from Your Lordship before acting in the matter and if Your Lordship so instructs me by telegraph I will lose no time in seeing the Minister for Foreign i Affairs.

With reference to Lord 0.Hamilton's suggestion that the facts should be brought to the notice of the Porte with a request for the punishment of the assailants, I am directed by Lord Lansdowne to enquire whether, apr# from the inconvenience of raising with ^ . v the Turkish Government the question of the status of the inhabitants of Bahrein, Lord G.Hamilton has considered the question whether it is desirable to make a communication to the Porte implying that His Majesty's Government regard the territory in which ^the attack was made as being under the jurisdiction &gt; of The Under Gecretary of State India Office.of the oultan. In the 5th paragraph of a letter from the Ind ia Office of the 2nd of November 1888, it was props osecl that Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople should be informed that Her Majesty's Government did not consider that the Porte was in effective occup ation of the Arabian coast beyond Katif. A copy of that letter was transmitted to Sir W. White for his guidance. On April 23, 1893, Sir O.^ord, who succeeded Sir W,White as Her Majestyts Ambassador at Constant inople reported in a Despatch of whisli a copy was enclosed in a letter from this Office of the 29th of the same month that he had pointed out to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that Her Majesty’s Government, while admitting the sover- - . . • eignty of the Sultan over the territory from Buss- oiah. to El Katif, considered that the coast runningto the south of that place was looked upon as debateahle land. Sir 0.Ford added that Her Tlajestys Government had entered into arrangemants with the native chiefs along tha coast by which it was est ablished that disputes arising there were to be referred for settlement, to the British Resident at Bushire.

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, rp 0 The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to report, for the information of the Government of India, a very serious incident which recently occurred in Turkish territory,^ at a place called El-Derya, some thirty or forty miles south of Katif, when Sheikh ; Selman-hin-Diaij-el-Khalifah, a cousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, with his son and nephew and 23 followers, were massacred by a marauding tribe, said to belong to the Behaih section of the Almurra. Mr. Gaskin’s letter reporting the occurrence is forwarded herewith. 2. During my recent visit to Bahrein, the Chief, who has taken the matter very much to heart, spoke to me regarding it. He said that there were two courses open, either that the British Government should^ represent the matter to the Turkish Government and urge the Turkish authorities to give him redress, or that he should he allowed to organise an expedition to pursue and punish the murderers. 3 . It is, in my opinion, very undesirable that the Chief should he allowed to take the matter into his own hands. It is very possible that he may he able to organise an expedition, but such an expedition would undoubtedly be objec tionable to the Turkish Government, and it is impossible to foresee what the result of such action on the Chief’s part^ would he. I accordingly advised the Chief to refrain from such an enterprise, and I promised him that I would represent the matter to the Turkish authorities, through Her Britannic Majesty’s &gt; Consul at Basrah. This I have now done, and I have also instructed Mr. Gaskin, as early * action is very desirable, to communicate direct with the Kaimmakam of Katif j in the matter. No. 219, dated Bahrein, the 12th December 1900. From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Political Assistant at Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward, in original, for your information, a letter I have received from the Chief of Bahrein and copies of two Arabic reports recorded in this office regarding the recent murder of Sheikh Selman-bm-lhaij- el-Khalifah, his son Diaij and his nephew Ahdul Ealman-bm-Bashid a,nd 23 followers on the morning of the 3rd instant by the Behaih section of the Almurra tribe at a locality called El-Derya on the mainland in Turkish terri tory about thirty to forty miles south of KafifT The murdered Sheikh, on the 18th November, crossed to the_ mainland on a hunting expedition, and took with him his two sons, Diaij and Bishir, a nephew named Abdul Eahman-bin-Rashid 20 followers and four com- panions, one from the Almurra, one from the A]man and two from the Beni Haiir as a precaution against molestation from the tribes to which they belong. A party o/about fourteen men of the Dowasir tribe of Bahrem crossed at the same time and encamped near Sheikh Selman. It appears that, on the 2nd instant, a large body of the Almurra Bedouins came on their camels from the interior, and, at nightfall, after tethering their camels a few miles from Sheikh Selman’s camp, they surprised the hunting party a little after midnight, and massacred them all except Bishir a nd two followers who escaped with wounds. One of the Sheikh s negroes is said to have killed three of the attacking party before he was killed. The Dowasir lost one man who happened to he in the Sheikh’s tent, hut the res of them managed to escape to their boats and offered no assistance to Sheikh Selman. £2 I am also informed that, when Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab Pasha of Darain heard of the carnage, he went out with a number of persons and buried the victims. It is generally thought that the cause which led to these regrettable murders is that, in 1898, some Amameras of Bahrein, while engaged in hunting on the mainland, were attacked by Almurra robbers, and two of their number were killed. The Amameras to be even with the Almurra killed the son of their Sheikh last year, and the Almurra undertook the recent massacre to avenge their Chief’s son. The El-Khalifah family of Bahrein have no blood-feud with the Almurra, and, though the Amamera are residents of Bahrein, their behaviour cannot be considered as being sufficient ground for the Almurra to commit the murders. I am, therefore, of opinion that the hope of obtaining plunder was the inducement. The Chief of Bahrein returned to Moharrag on the 8 th instant in the afternoon, and on the following morning I paid him a visit to express my sympathies for his loss. He begged me to request you to move Her Majesty’s Government to make strong representations to the Turkish Government for the summary punishment of the murderers. He added that, if the perpetrators of the outrage are permitted to remain unpunished, the prestige and peace hitherto enjoyed by the Rulers of Bahrein through the protection afforded them by the British Government will be destroyed, and it will be thought that the people of Bahrein are incompetent to defend themselves, and consequently they will be open to much maltreatment when met by lawless tribesmen; and under the circumstances, he would be obliged to ask the British Government for per mission to organise, with the help of some friendly tribes, an expedition against the Almurra. These murders are without parallel in the annals of Bahrein, and Sheikh Selman was the most intelligent member of the ruling family, and his murder is much lamented by the people of Bahrein. While it is advisable to dis courage the Chief organising an expedition to operate against the Almurra, who inhabit the confines of the district of Al-Hassa, which is likely to give rise to complications with Turkey, which it is desirable to avoid, the case is of too serious a nature for our Government to allow it to pass unnoticed, without doing material harm to the value of our protection and to our prestige in the Persian Gulf generally. I would, therefore, venture to suggest that the Govern ment of India may be recommended to have strong representations made through Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, with a view to compel the Ottoman Government to issue strong injunctions to the Governor-General of Al-Hassa for the capture and punishment of the persons concerned in the outrage. Translated purport of a letter from Sheikh Is a-bin-Ali-el-Khalifah, Chief of Bahrein to the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, dated the 17th Shaban 1318 (10th December 1900). After compliments—I beg to inform you of what has befallen Sheikh Selman and his followers. On the night of Monday, the 12th Shaban (3rd December 1900), be was on his way to Darain, from a shooting excursion with the object of returning to Bahrein. They were all asleep, and were awakened at about 7 hours after sunset, and saw a large number of men of Almurra tribe, who had come on camels. They had horses with them and were armed, and they attacked (Sheikh Selman’s party). Sheikh Selman came out personally to see and identify them (the attacking party). When they saw Selman, they attacked and killed him, his son Diaij, his nephew Abdul Rahman-bin-Rashid and 22 persons. Pour persons were also wounded. I have written this letter for your information. My said brother (cousin ?) was also accompanied by men belong ing to the Beni Hajir, Ajman and Almurra tribes who have also been killed. I request an answer in this matter. fTRANSLATION. Information collected after enquiry regarding the murder of Sheikh Selma.n-bin-Diaij and his party. Persons, who arrived from Katif on 9th December 1900, report that Muham- mad-bin-Jabbara was in his boat near the shore off Darain which is south of Dammam. The Bedouins of that part informed Muhammad-bin-Jabbara of what had befallen Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij at the hands of Almurra. He at once went to Darain and informed Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab who went to Katif with some men. He also collected some more men at Katif, and with most of his men w r ent to Sheikh Khaled-bin-Ali, who had gone on a shooting excursion outside Katif near a village called Safoa, and informed him of the murder of Sheikh Selman and his men. He himself remained with Sheikh Khaled, but sent his remaining men to Derya where they saw the corpses which were 29 mail. Of these, three belonged to the attacking party of Almurra. They also distinguished the corpses of Sheikh Selman, his son Diaij, his nephew (Abdul Rahman), 18 followers and of the two Beni Hajirs, one Ajman and one Almurra Bedouins, who had accompanied Sheikh Selman, and one of the Dow r asir tribe. They buried them. TRANSLATION. Details of the incident connected with (the murder of) Sheikh Selman. On 18th November 1900, Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij left Bahrein with a view to shoot at a place called Darain on the mainland. He was accompanied by his sons Diaij and Bushir, 22 followers and Bedouin companions, viz., one of Almurra, one of Ajman and two of Beni Hajir tribes. About 14 men of the Dowasir tribe had also followed him. On the night of Monday, the 3rd (5th?) December, 7 hours after sunset, many Almurra Bedouins attacked them (Sheikh Selman and his party). They had come on camels, one camel having carried more than one p-rson, near a place called Derya. They had horses with them. They left their camels at a distance to rest. They (Selman and his party) were asleep, and were unaware (of the presence) of the Bedouins. Suddenly they were fired on. Sheikh Selman, his son Diaij and five other persons were sleeping in a tent, others being outside it. After they were awakened, they became confused. Only a few men were able to get hold of their arms. The Bedouins surrounded them and opened rifle fire. None of them (Sheikli Selman s party) were saved except twm, viz.. Sheikh Selman’s son Bushir and his slave Jowher, who were wounded, but they effected their escape. The Dowasirs were near them (Sheikh Selman’s party), and though they heard the firing, they did not come to their assistance. The Bedouins, after the incident, took away the aims and things of the murdered men. 'Ihe next morning Bushir and Jowher went to the Dowasirs and came with them to Bahrein, which they reached on 5th December 1900. Enclosure No. 2.
