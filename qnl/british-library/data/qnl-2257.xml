IQ •v 1 \-Jo With reference to India Office letter ITo.P 4226/26 of the 13th instant on the subject of the appointment of certain Indian Medical Service officers in Persia to be Vice Consuls, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to state that in view of India Office letter P 3797 of the 1st ultimo in which this department was informed of Captain Hay*s departure on leave and his replacement by Captain Ledger there is now no object in issuing a letter of appointment as Vice Consul to the former. 2 . I am to add that instructions for the appointment of Captain Ledger as Vice Consul at Seistan were forwarded to His Majesty* s Minister at Tehran on the 11th ultimo and a copy was sent to the India Office with Foreign Office letter K 13665/4638/234 of November 13th last. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, UtC IS23 c , India Office.c The Poreien Secretary to the Government of India, To His Majesty’s Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Ho.P.2657, dated the 26th August 1926. 2. The intention of the Government of India’s telegram to which you refer certainly seems to have been misunderstood. They were and are aware that it does not rest with them to make Consular appointments and all that they intended to convey in this instance was that they had no objection to the proposed appointment, if His Majesty’s Minister had none. It is much regretted that the remainder of the telegram was worded in a somewhat misleading fashion, from which no doubt the confusion arose. In future the correct course of procedure will be strictly observed. 2. The Government of India are also of opinion that, when Major Stocker vacates his present appointment, it might be worth while to re-examine the reasons for appointing him as Vice-Consul in addition to his other duties*'3fat, his appointment having been notified to the Persian Government, they do not wish to take any present action which might have the appearance of calling that appointment in question. 4. I am also to express the regret of the Government of India that the proposal to appoint Captain Hay as Medical Dated Delhi, the November 1926 Sir Appointment of Major C.J.Stocker, I.M.3., as His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Meshed.

Tehran. 5th April, 1905. fio, 80. My Lord, His Majesty'a Resident in the Persian oulx' has sent me the enclosed copy of a despatch addressed by him to the Oovernxaent of inaia on the subject of the status of the officers serving under him at Bushire. I concur with the views expressed by Major coo: in this communication and X thinA there is a good deal to oe said for giving the Assistants at Bushire who are political officers of the Government of India, diplomatic rather than Consular ran*. The nearest analogy to the position occupied by the Resident in the Persian Gulf is that of the political Agent and Consul-General at Zanzibar, who is, or was in my time, at once the Resident at the court of an Arab ruler under British protection and thus approximately in the same position as the chiefs of Bahrain, Koweit, the Pirate coast, and practically though not technically Muscat, and Consul- General in German Hast Africa, i.e., in a province ruled by a Governor representing an independent sovereign. At Zanzibar the officers performing the duties of the assistants • - at Bushire all had consular rahfc, the senior officer being a consul and the three juniors Vice-Consuls. The senior judge held also the ran£ of consul and the junior judge the tr ran* of Vioe-Consul. There were thus under the Agent and Consul-General six officers holding consular ranh, two of whom were consuls and four Vice-Consuls and this 'plethora^of Consular The u&amp;rquess of Landowne, K.Q., etc., etc., etc.f - 2 - Consular appoinman^a in one place' to use ka^or oox'b expression, oooasioned no objeotions or inconveniences* X'm appointment of tlxe ?irat .assistant as Consul, and of tne -econi Assistant as Vice-Consul would therefore seem a eiraole way of getting over the difficulty pointed out by Hie Majesty’s H® si dent. The alternative course of giving him the 'local rank' of secretary of Legation or Second Secretary in the Idplomatic service would undoubtedly present the advantage of adding something to the prestige of the Keoidency, an end desirable in itself under existing circumstances in Southern Persia, and of expnaaiaing the fact that the functions of the Healdont and his staff are, unlike those of their foreign colleagues, of diplomatic rather than of a consular character, concerned as they are not merely with the orotaction of British trade and interests in Buahire and Fare, but with the political affairs of the Arao states and indeed of the whole coasts of the Persian Gulf* There would of course oe, 1 imagine, nothing incongruous in attaching an officer with a diplomatic character to a mission not technically diplomatic* Mr* :*iget, now His Majesty’s Minister at Bangkok, was attached for some time, when a secretary in the Diplomatic Service, to the Agency at Zanzibar and almost the entire staff in Cairo is diplomatio, although Egypt is not a sovereign state and the chiefs of missions there are properly speaking Consuls-General in an ottoman dependency. whihe however there may be grounas for giving a preference to one rather than to the other of the two alternative suggestions made by His Majesty’s Resident, 1 am decidedly of opinion that the reasons advanced by him forfor investing the officers of the Resiaenoy witli a formal diplomatic or consular character (whichever four Rxcellfenoy fchinfcs best) are sound ana that the step proposed by him shoula be taken without undue delay* X have the honour to be with toe higuest re spec t t Sty lore, four moat obedient, huiaiile servant, /Signed) Arthur M*Hardings-Xoaure no. a In Tehran peBpa^oh ttetea. lath July 19£6 in aompllanoo wiiih intjtrucliiontj reoetvad from Hiii Mftjtsty’e principal secretary of atato for roretgri Affaira, I taunbiuiw Xq you horov?iUli ^wo letters of authority conferring on Captain A* , »«revor ana Captain de V^ro Condon the looul x*unJc respectively of Consul and Vice-Consul* aiun Jurisdiction over the southern ports of peroia* I have tnia day applisu to the i/ushir ed howleh for th# recognition of i&amp;ose Officers in the above capacities.

I regret to inform you that your request for Customs exemption for Lieutenant Colonel Heron contained in your Despatch Ko.f.38 and T.4B can only be entertained by the Persian authorities provided the Government of India appoints this officer His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Hashed. It would then, I hope, be possible to obtain exemption for him on the same grounds as it is obtained for :.*ajor Hicholson at Bushire. At the same time I would point out this class of difficulty would largely disappear if His majesty’s Legation were punctually and regularly informed of such appointments in order that they should be notified to the Persian Government at the proper time.
