Sir Pupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political JResident, Persian Gu}.f Hesidency, Bahrain.GOLD BUSINESS IN KUWAIT During the past nine months, the gold business has been very active £n Kuwait. It is estimated that over £6,000,000 worth has passed through here in this time. Here is the procedure:- Gold bars mainly of 12^- kilos but also of 5, 2 and 1 kilos, arrive by Middle East Airline from Beirut, consigned to various bullion dealers. The bars are melted down here to various sized bars, mainly to 10 tola bars. These bars are then smuggled to India mainly by dhows to Goa, Calicut and the Kathiawar coast, but also by deck passengers on the B.I mails and in various hiding places such as in batteries and the engines of small cars. In payment, notes are smug gled out of India and returned to Kuwait where thay are paid to the Bank. To a lesser extent the Indians arrange payment in New York in dollars. It is not known for certain from where the gold reaches Beirut bikt it is fairly certain it arrives from Europe and before that from the United Kingdom and South Africa. The Kuwait merchant pays Beirut (t) by clean sterling transfers to Aden, Hongkong, Singapore, ^outh Africa and London, all within the sterling area.How the money eventually gets to Beirut is not known. (2) by dollars brought in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere and (3) by sovereigns. The Bank has sent note remittances totalling about £4,000,000 to India during this period. x his has enabled Kuwait to pay for all her imports from India, as well as Colombo, Singapore and Hongkong without using sterling. It has also enabled the Bank to buy about £600,000 in India. The net result is that India is losing heavily on the wholeNo. C/4^ (3/3) The Pblitical Agency, .Cu’vait. /£&gt;/£ June, 1949* Dear Sir Hupert, Please refer to the note forwarded with my letter No. C/103'dated 27th April, 1949. 2. I understand that gold bars that were being sent to Kuwait from Beirut bore the stamps of JOHNSON MATTHSY &amp; Co and of N.M. HQTHCKILD &amp; Co. 3. ■‘•'hese are, I understand, bullion dealers of London; but there is of course nothing to show that the bars were not legally exported from the U.P. to France or Switzerland before being sent to Beirut. 4. I now understand that, as a result of the suppression by His Majesty’s Government of open gold dealings in Hong Kong, there has been a steep rise in the price of gold in Beirut and the return movement of gold from Kuwait to Beirut has started. It is considered that this is due to better transport facilities to Hong Kong being available from Beirut than from Kuwait. Yours ever, H.E.

Sir, My attention has been drawn to the considerable evidence that has accumulated during recent months of increased sales of Russian gold on international markets, particularly in Switzerland and Tangier. There is also evidence that the Bulgarian Government, acting no doubt for the Soviet Govern ment, have been offering gold for sale. 2. According to the limited evidence available, the first step taken in making gold available for use in non-Communist countries is its transfer to a bank in, for example, Switzer land. (This is perhaps the point at which gold movements may be most easily detected; £1,000,000 worth of gold weighs about 2i tons, and the physical transfer of such quantities naturally calls for special arrangements). The gold, once deposited in a bank abroad, is then exchanged into foreigh currency. This may be carried out by various means. Gold mav be sold openly or disposed of locally through inter mediaries, gold dealers or on the Black Market. Such evidence as I have suggests that the latter methods are usually em ployed, presumably in order to maintain a greater degree of secrecy and also, incidentally, to take advantage of the higher prices obtainable on the Blank Market. There is also evidence that Russian gold is being used for the manufacture of counter feit gold coins of various denominations. As soon as funds are standing to the credit of the Russians, or their agents, in foreign currencies, e.g. dollars-, transfers can be made to any part of the world through normal banking channels. Here again, intermediaries are frequently employed, presumably for greater secrecy. 3. It is possible that a certain proportion of such sales is being devoted to legitimate commercial purposes, but the evidence I have suggests that most of the proceeds are being devoted to subversive ends, such as the financing of Communist and fellow-travelling propaganda, especially in Central and Southern America, the Near East and South-East Asia. In par ticular, there are known to have been shipments of gold or transfers of the proceeds in other currencies to New York, Guatemala, Honduras, Beirut, Saigon and Macao. It seems possible also that the Russians are expending considerable sums on the organisation of Communist propaganda in Western Europe. The present intensification of the Communist effort on the Labour Front, for instance under the aegis of the W.F.T.U. and its Trade Departments, makes it seem likely that there has been in increase in expenditure on agitation, strike pay, etc. 4. It is therefore important that you should report any information which may be available on the following subjects•- (a) Movement of gold from Communist to non-Communist areas; (b) Exchange of gold of suspected Russian origin into local currencies, or manufacture of counterfeit gold coins from Russian gold; Ac)- 2 - (c) Transfers of Russian gold or of proceeds of Russian gold from one non-Communist area to another; (d) Payments of Russian origin in support of Communist Parties, subversive movements, propaganda campaigns, etc., or evidence of increased financial support to these movements. 5. I realise that these are far from easy subjects on which to obtain information, as at every step the moves are carried out in secrecy, and financial transactions enjoy in many countries the protection of the inviolability of banking in formation. I should, hwwever, be glad if you would bear the foregoing paragraphs in mind, and if you would report to me by despatch any such developments which may come to 'your notice. If, for example, you observe that strikers show unusual staying- power or that yraxwlMx Left-wing Unions are unexpectedly pro vocative, it might perhaps be an indication that substantial funds, possibly of Russian origin, were available. 6. You are also authorised, if you consider it appropriate, to bring the above considerations to the attention of the Governments to which you are accredited, and to invite their co-operation and comments.

I am directed to enclose a copy of a letter which Pelly received from the Manager of the Eastern Bank. Would you kindly send us your comments. H.G. Jakins, Esq., The Political Agent, Kuwait.COPY TH K BMK LIMITE D. Bahrain. 12th December, 194-9. Dear Pelly, I refer to your letter marked 'Secret” Do.C/L-433 of 1st instant. I am told that any gold purchased by Bahrain dealers is bought from Kuwait dealers but the actual country of origin of the gold is not known here. It is thought by local dealers that the gold imported into Kuwait comes from south America (probably Brazil) via the Lebanon. So far, there has been no mention of Bussi a or her sateelites as countries of origin. I am also tola that, while bar gold is imported into Kuwait from the Lebanon for sale, the trade in sovereigns is in the reverse direction. Information here is very meagre and enquiries in Kuwait and in Beyrouth might prove more fruitful. If I do hear anything of interest I shall certainly let you know. Yours sincerely, Sgd. D.T.

The emphasis in the papers is on the various ways through which the gold is sourced around the world, particularly other parts of the Middle East, such as the Levant. This is in contrast to previous periods when concern with gold smuggling primarily focused on Indian sources of contraband gold. The correspondence is primarily between the Political Agency in Kuwait, the Political Residency in Bahrain, and the Government of Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Gold trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000161#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
