A decision on the lease was deferred by the Political Agent in Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), until confirmation of where the British Residency was to be located in Bahrain was confirmed. A map showing the plot of land in question, which states that the land was sold, not leased, by the Government of Bahrain to the Government of Great Britain, is included in the file (folio 16).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000ae#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000ae#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
