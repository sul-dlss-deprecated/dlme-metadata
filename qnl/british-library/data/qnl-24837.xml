Dear Sir, With reference to our conversation of this morning, we should he grateful if you could ob tain for us information on taxation or import duty restrictions in connection with^possible civil engineering contracting operations In Kov/eit. As explained, we are in discussion with the Koweit Oil Company on the subject of carrying out civil engineering work for them in their concession area in Koweit and we understand from Mr. Kemp of the Oil Company that as far as work for them is. concerned the position is quite clear and_taxation and import duties would not affect us. it is con ceivable, however, that once we were established in Koweit for the c il Company we might wish to, or be invited to, carry out constructional work for other clients, e*g« the Koweit iOvernment. or other authorities. It is in these categories that possibly some taxation and import restrictions may/ Gontd....may not ap considerat any inform ^ able to obmav not apply. It would be helpful to us in our consideration if you could kindly let us .iave any information on this aspect that you ma;; oe qVi 1 o -hr* obt.n 1 n .
