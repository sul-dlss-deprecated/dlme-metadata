It will be convenient to deal with the above subject in two sections, as follows :— (1) Marine surveys on the Tigris and Euphrates carried out by the Eoyai Indian Marine. (2) Dredging and surveying operations other than by the Royal Indian Marine including those carried out under the direction of Colonel Sir George Buchanan, Kt., C.I.E., M.I.C.E. (1) 'Marine Surveys on the Tigris and Euphrates carried out by the Royal Indian Marine' In February 1915, enquiry* from the Director, Royal Indian Marine, elicited the infor- ♦Serial No 1 mationf that no surveys on. the Tigris or Euph- tSerial No 2 rates were at that time being carried out by the Royal Indian Marine, It was considered that the opportunity which then presented itself for making detailed surveys of these rivers should not iSorial No 3 he lost, and the Director was accordingly ins tructed to make arrangements for work to be taken in hand, and to prepare a programme of work. Intimation was received from the Director, that Commander Hickman with a survey party left for Mesopotamia on the 18th of March 1915. During the next few months items of survey work were carried out as circumstances re' quired, including a portion of the Channel of the New Euphrates and some work on the Hammar Lake. Operations were, however, hampered owing to the steamer used by the survey party being requisitioned for military operations and some of the survey officers diverted to other Work In August f a definite programme of survey work was submitted by the General Officer Commanding, b^it it was decided that on §Serial Nos. 4 and 5. account of climatic conditions work should be [[Seiial No. a suspended for the time being, and the party returned to India. It was subsequently j| arranged that, in view of the difficulty of providing a vessel for the use of the party and other con siderations, survey operations should not be resumed till the beginning/of 1916. A survey party was accordingly sent out again in January 1916. The General Officer Serial No 7 Commanding proposed to employ it on the water ways in the vicinity of the Hammar Lake and the New Euphrates €hannel and between the New and Old Euphrates Channel. After arrival the IfSerial No. 8. General Officer Commanding reported^ that the party appeared to be lacking in personnel and equipment, and asked for information as to the date by which it would be fully manned and equipped. Instructions accordingly were issued to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, and at the request of the General Officer Commanding he was also instructed to provide launches for the survey party. Subsequent information received from the Director, Royal Indian Marine, **Serial No, 9. seemed to indicate** that the wishes of the General Officer Commanding in respect of personnel, // J - x Un l h eS and e( i ui P m&lt;3nt had 1&gt;een Beyond the survey of the Hammar Lake (vide Serial Ihf ^o: 22) we have no precise information as to the nature and extent of the operations carried out by the survey party belonging to the Royal Indian Marine. (2) ' Dredging and Surveying operations other than by the Royal Indian Marine.' On thef'j' 16th April 1915, the Director, Royal Indian Marine, was informed that it was ftSerial No. 10. understood that a dredger would probably be found useful by Force ' D ' in the Shatt-el-Arab ; and he was instructed to communicate on the subject with the Marine Transport Officer and the Marine survey party with Force ' D/' He was asked whether, if a dredger was required^ t+The Royal Indian Marine Dredger at Bom- the ' MudJJ Turtle ' was suitable for the purpose and available, and, if not, what arrangements he ' e _ ri! * 0 '. ' suggested. In his telegram§J No. A.S.-251, dated the 17th April 1916, (he Director, Royal Indian Marine, replied that the ' Mud Turtle ' was not available, but that he was communicating with the Marine Transport Officer, Force ' D, ' and the Officer Commanding Survey Party, and that he would wire suggestions on hearing from them. 5 S697(w)AP2 On the* 1st May 1915, the General Officer Commanding, Force ' D,' informed the Chief of the General Staff, that the Principal Marine ♦Serial No. 12. Transport Officer had wired to the Director, Boyal Indian Marine, to provide one large dredger for the Shatt-el-Arab and a smaller one for special use on the Tigris and Euphrates, adding that both were wanted early, and asking that their supply might be expedited In his telegramf of the 14th May, the Director, Royal Indian Marine intimated that the Bombay Port Trust offered two second-hand tSerial No. 13. Simons' suction dredgers for sale for £ 25,000 and £27,000 each, respectively, adding that the machinery of the dredgers generally was in good condition but that both dredg4rs and their appliances would have to be put in thorough working order prior to despatch to the Gulf and that this would take at least three weeks. Particulars in respect of the price of the dredgers J Serial No. 14. were communicated J by the Chief of the General Staff to the General Officer Commanding, Force 'D,' who was asked whether in his opinion the dredgers were likely to be of sufficient value to warrant the expenditure. The General Commanding's reply§ was to the effect that with- §SerialNo. 15. out seein g or trying the dredgers it was impos sible to say whether they were worth the price asked, but that the Principal Marine Transport Officer had wired to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, full particulars of the conditions which the dredgers were required to meet and had been asked whether they would meet these requirements, and that to be of use they should arrive in Mesopotamia before the monsoon. The General Officer Commanding also suggested that the final purchase of the dredgers might be deferred until after a month's trial. On the 23rdit May 1915, the General Officer Commanding intimated that a marine survey ' '■■■ of the Hammar Lake had been completed and [[Serial No. 16. asked that the two dredgers be purchased as early as possible. The Government of Bombay were therefore addressed on the subject, it being mentioned that the General Officer Commanding wished to have the dredgers on trial. The proposal to purchase the dredgers was also communicated to the Secretary of State on the 2nd June^ and 1 a further communication in regard to the urgency T1 Serial No. 17. 0 f the matter made on the 6th June**. On the **Serial No. 18. Yth Juneft the Secretary of State communicated Serial No. 19. his concurrence to the purchase being made on the most favourable terms obtainable. In telegram No. 182-P dated tie 9th June 1915, the Government of Bombay intimated that the Port Trust were willing to let ns have the dredgers on a month's trial, adding that an expert dredgmg_master and a Chief Engineer were required for each vessel. The Secretary of State was therefore asked to send ont the reqmred personnel, and on the JSth June we received intimation that these had been engaged and were leaving Home on the following day. On the 16thtt June intimation was received that the two dredgers would probably sail for Basrah about the 22nd June. On§§ the 1st July, |JSerial No. 20. however, intimation was received from the Direc- pSerial No. 21. tor, Royal Indian Marine, that the weather was . considered too bad for the dredgers to start, and in view of the delay the Government of India agreed on a representation from the Port Trust to waive the condition of a month s trial before purchase The dredgers did not arrive in Mesopotamia till towards the end of September, ■v ' ' goon after their arrival the General Officer Com- jiljSerial No. 22. manding reportedHH that they were incomplete in respect • of many articles of equipment, etc. In telegranm No. 3063, dated the 21st September 1915, the Secretary of State wired that &amp; he understood that the Port Officer, Basrah, : ^Serial No. 23. had been instructed to carry out dredging works on the Shatt and on the bar of the river, adding that he had been privately informed by the Admiralty that to undertake these operations without the best expert advice would be dangefous, and that they therefore suggested caution. The Secretary of State also stated that before any action was taken it seemed advisable that Sir George Buchanan should be sent from Rangoon to advise. The substance of ***Serial No. 24. this telegram was communicated*** to the General Officer Commanding by the Chief of the General Staff and he was at the same time informed that measures were being t^ken to obtain the services of Sir George Buchanan and that in the meantime no dredging operations in the Shatt -el-Arab should be undertaken before Sir George Buchanan arrived. The General Officer Command- tttSenal No. 25. ^ re ply|-j -j stated that his proposal was to Remove the bar at Qurna to enable the naval sloops to proceed up the rivers as far as(Di Chahbaisli and Ezra's Tomb at low waters. He begged for non-interference with, bis discretion in carrying out work connected with the military operations adding that to carry out dredging work * q • i at or below Qurna was in no way desired by him. The 1 ella a ' Chief of the General Staff informed * the General Officer Commanding in reply that the opinion of the Admiralty which in such a matter could not be disregarded had been merely passed on to him and that it was not the wish of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief to fetter the General Officer Commanding's discretion. On the 31st October a telegram f was received in the Foreign and Political Department in , g erial atq 27 which it was incidentally stated that the Sscre- tary of State agreed to the deputation of Sir George Bachanan if he was urgently required to advise on dredging work in Mesopotamia, and on terms to be offered to Sir George having been fixed, the Burma Government were asked for his services on the 21st November 1915. On the 27th November we were informed by the Government of Burma that the Rangoon Port Commissioners were willing to lend Sir George's services and that the latter was willing to accept the employment offered; it was also stated that Sir George would + S ialNo 2^ leave whenever required. In reply the Govern- + ' ' ment J of Burma were informed that it was import ant that Sir George Buchanan should arrive in Mesopotamia as early as possible, and that he should leave on the 30th November from Bombay and that further instructions would be sent to him care of the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who wished to confer witlf Sir George regarding the dredging operations. Sir George Buchanan left Rangoon on the 30th November. The instructions in T question were despatched§ as indicated and were re- [ av § Sei ial iSo. 29. ceived by Sir George on arrival in Bombay. As a re sult of his conference with the Director. Royal Indian Marine, Sir George decided to proc3ed at once to Delhi to report to the Government of India. Briefly stated, the purport of this report . was I] to the effect that the two dredgers already obtained from the Bombay Port Trust, namely, the &lt;&lt; Kalu ' and ' Jinga ' were on account of their heavy draught unsuitedfor work in Mesopota mia and Sir George recommended that he might be given authority to proceed to Rangoon to obtain certain engineering and survey staff, one of the shallow draft suction pump dredgers em ployed on the Twante Canal at Rangoon, a dredging master and crew complete, and all necessary accessories. It was decided, however, that Sir George should go direct to Basrah in order that S or i a l 31 he might put a stop to errors then being made and generally see what was required. Instructions^! accordingly were issued to Sir George who was given the title of Director-General of Port ** c • 1 N oo ' Administration and River Conservancy, Sir George then submitted detailed proposals** in respect of his requirements in the way of a dredger, engineers, and a surveying staff, and equip ment. These Sir George desired to obtain from Burma, and that Government was addressed in i+o tat oo Marine Depatment telegram No. H-10046,ft dated ttSenalNo. 33. ,, 0 , .^7 ^ , m-i er • v v -x- the 24th December 1915, m which the position was explained to them and they were informed that the Government of India would be grateful . if Sir George's wishes could be met. In telegramJJ j+^ena No. 34. 6gg2, dated the 25th December 19I5 ; the Gov ernment of Burma replied that the Lieutenant-Governor gladly acceded to the request of the Gov ernment of India though he could not conceal the inconvenience caused locally through doing so. From a telegram received on the 29th December it appeared that all Sir George's demands in res pect of staff and personnel were to be met except in the case of the river surveyor asked for who was reported to be medically unfit, Government were also at the same time informed that arrange ments were proceeding with reference to the transfer of the dredger and launches. The Govern ment of India asked the Burma Government to select another river surveyor. On the 31st DecQB&amp;ber the Burma Government wired to say that work was being put in hand for the despatch of the dredger when ready, probably in about a month's time, that arrangements had been made for dismantling the pipe line and terminal pontoon, and for preparing the d edger for sea, and an enquiry was made wh._ ther this action was correct or whether further orders were to be awaited (re peated in Serial No. 55). This enquiry together with information in respect of the progress made so far was communicated ^ to the General §§ Sexidl No. 35. Officer Commanding, Force ' D,' and in our telegram No. H-62, dated the 4th January 1916, a report was made to the Secretary of State stating the action taken with reference to the deputation to Mesopotamia of Sir George Buchanan and his staff and the proposal to sell the other two dredgers. In telegram No. 6, dated the 5th January, the Government of Burma informed us that Mr. Niven with his staff and equipment would sail direct for Bombay by the ' Oolabaria,' leaving Rangoon on the 15th January. They also intimated that a suitable substitute for Mr. Pascoe was not available in Burma, but recommended a Mr. Lakin serving with the 55th Coke's Rifles as being fully qualified. This recommendation was communicated to the General Officer Commanding in telegram No. 33700, dated the Sth January 1916, and in his telegram No. 111-20-^,, dated lOth January 1916, the General Officer Commanding replied that on on the arrivalof Lieutenant Lakin, Sir George Buchanan would consider whether that officer's services would be useful but that a river surveyor from the staff of the Calcutta Port Commissioners was still required by Sir George : from subsequent correspondence we ascertained that the services of Lieutenant Lakin were made over to Sir George. Enquiries from the Government of Bengal showed that no river surveyor could be obtained from the Calcutta Port Commissioners. In telegram* No. 321-1., dated the 7th January 1916, »Serial No. 36. the Government of Burma informed us that some spare parts, wire ropes and anchors were required for the dredger, at the same time adding that some of the parts mentioned were under order from Home and they suggested that some of the items should be obtained from the Bombay dockyard and some from Home. Action to obtain spare parts, etc., was immediately taken, the Director . Royal Indian Marine being asked in our telegram No. H-198, dated the 9th January 1916, to arrange for certain items and the Secretary of State in our telegram No. H-197, dated the 9th January 1916, to arrange for others. So far had precautions been taken to ensure the supply of the articles in question that in respect of certain items orders were placed both with the Secretary of State and with the Director, Royal Indian Marine. On the 8th January we received a telegram from the Burma Government asking for arrangements to be made for the transhipment of Mr. Niven's survey party and equipment for Mesopotamia and giving details of space required for equipment, etc. It was also then stated that Mr. Niven expected to leave Rangoon by the ' Orna ' on the 14th January, that the dredger would probably leave Rangoon on the 14th January and that she would tow the launch ' Rebel ' and escort the launch ' Industry.'* The purport of this telegram so far as the per sonnel and equipment were concerned was communicated by the Quartermaster-General to the Embarkation Commandant, Bombay, who was asked to arrange onward passage to Basrah on the first opportunity after the arrival of the party at Bombay. In consequence of being unable to obtain any reply from the General Officer Commanding, Force ' D,' as to whether the Burma dredger was required or not, we told the Burma Govern- • i \r vj ment in our telegramf No. H-218, dated the ' erla 0 ' ' 10th January 1916, that the preparations for the despatch of the dredger should be continued, but that she should not be despatched until they received further instructions. In reply the Burn 1 a Government stated in their telegram of the 11th January that portions of the dredger equipment had already been shipped on the ' Oola- baria ' sailing on the 17th January and asked that further instructions be wired to reach Rangoon on the 14th of the same month. The General Officer Commanding in his telegram of the 10th January intimated that Sir George Buchanan agreed to the despatch of the dredger about the 14th January and in our telegram No. H-274, dated the 12th January 1916, we instructed the Burma Government to despatch the dredger as soon as ready. In their teleg-am No. 53-1., dated the 12th January 1916, the Government of Burma re peated a telegram which they had despatched to Sir George Buchanan stating that the dredger was leaving Burma with old casings and pumps and strongly advising that new pump casings and internal suction and discharge pipes be fitted at Bombay. We repeated this telegram to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, and instructed him to the effect that if the necessary materia] could be obtained locally to arrange to carry out the work at Bombay on arrival of the dredger and to keep us informed of what was being done. The Director, Royal Indian Marine, + a • i xr qq i n replyj stated that the suction and discharge I benal iNo« oo« • i i i i i -i • pipes should have been commenced m Rangoon where drawings were available and accurate measurements could have been taken before the dredger left. The Director added that no information was available as to what additional material would be required, but that on arrival of the dredger she would be inspected and a report § Serial No. 39. 8,8 ^ ier ^ ness ^o go on to Basrah forwarded. We repeated § the Director's telegram to the Burma Government and told them to send the Director any available information likely to b© of assistance to him in making preliminary arrangements for fitting the new pump casing and internal suction and discharge pipes and informed the Director, Royal Indian Marine, accordingly. In his telegram No. A.S.-507, dated the 13th January 1916, the Director, Royal Indian Marine, intimated that the anchors and wire rope which he was asked to furnish could be supplied but pointed out the discrepancy in the breaking strain of the wires as quoted in the Burma Govern ment telegram and gave the breaking strain of the wire which he was prepared to provide. We communicated the Director's telegram both to the Burma Government and the General Officer Commanding. We also communicated the reply received from the Burma Government to the General Officer Commanding and asked whether he concurred; but received no reply. In their telegram of the 14th January, the Government of Burma intimated that 34 members of Mr. Niven's survey party sailed from Rangoon on the 14th January by the ' Orna ' which was expected to arrive at Bombay on the 23rd and that Mr. Niven with the remainder of the party would leave vid Calcutta on the 18th and would arrive at Bombay on the same date as the party which proceeded there by sea. The Quartermaster-General inIndia communicated this information to the Embarkation Commandant. In telegram No. 58, dated 19th January, the Burma Government reported that the dredger and the ** Oolabaria ' sailed for Bombay on the 17th January, that the native crew for the dredger had not sailed, at the same time requesting that the engagement of certain ratings should be arranged. This telegram was repeated to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, with instructions to engage the necessary personnel. In telegram No. 79B, dated 17th January 1916, the Principal Port Officer, Rangoon, also reported that the dredger towing the paddler ' Rebel ' and launch ' Industry ' steaming in company sailed for Bombay on the 17th January. We repeated this information to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, and to the General Officer Commanding, Force ' D.' On the 21st January the Director, Royal Indian 'IN 4a Marine,* wired to the Quartermaster-General that Mr. Niven had arrived at Bombay on that day and was detailed to sail the following day by the ' Edavanha,' that Mr. Niven had im portant business for Sir George Buchanan in Bombay in connection with the dredgers and could not possibly complete it in time and asked that his departure might be deferred till the following tSerialNo 41 mail. This permission was accorded,f but it was also stated that as many as possible of the party should sail by the ' Edavanha.' On the 25th January the Director, Royal Indian Marine, intimated that the remainder of Mr. Niven's party had all sailed. In our telegram No. 11-2251, dated 25th March 1916, we enquired of the Secretary of State wnether the requisites for the dredger ordered from Home had been despatched and, if so, to inform us of the vessel and date of sailing. Early in April we received intimation that they had been despatched and this information was communicated to the General Officer Com manding, An indent for tide gauges complete with fittings and record sheets was made by the General Officer Commanding in a telegram dated the 13th March. This telegram was repeated to the Secretary of State on tlie 16th March, who was asked to make necessary arrangements for their supply and for their despatch to Basrah. In telegram No. 17802, dated the 9th June 1916, the Secretary of State informed us that the tide gauges had been shipped the day previously per B. S. ' Rhenfels ' to Abadan. On the 2nd March 1916 the General Officer Commanding^; submittted a demand for addi- + Serial ^ tional personnel and some tents and shouldaries on + behalf of Sir George Buchanan. This telegram was repeated to the Government of Burma, who were informed that if the personnel named by Sir George were available and willing they should be directed to proceed to Bombay without delay and to report to the Embarkation Commandant, who would arrange for their onward passage. Among the personnel asked for was Mr. Berrill, a Public Works Department engineer. On enquiry being made of the Burma Government as to the extent to which they were able to meet Sir George Buchanan's wishes we learnt that one of the clerks and the jemadar asked for, to gether with the tents and shouldaries, had already been despatched, that the other clerk asked for had refused to accept the appointment, and that a further communication would be made xegarding Mr. Bcrrill's departure. Some delay occurred, in consequence of the question of the pay and tiavelling allowance to be granted to Mr. Berrill having been raised, and it was not until the 29th April that Mr, Berrill left Rangoon for Mesopotamia. On the 6th March the General Officer Commanding§ wired complaining about the delay §Serial No. 43. despatch of the dredger and her gear. On the 9th March the General Officer Commanding's telegram of the 6th March was repeatedjj to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who was USerial No. 44. informed that any component parts of gear not yet sent should be despatched as early as possible ; he was also instructed to despatch the steam cutter 'Kathleen' which had been obtained from the Bassein Port .Trust for Sir George Buchanan without delay. Further com plaints in respect of the delay in despatching the dredger and her accessories were*!! received ^[Serial No. 45. from the General Officer Commanding very ♦♦Serial No. 46. shortly afterwards and these were repeated** to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who was asked to make every endeavour to despatch immediately all articles pertaining to the dredger and her auxiliary craft which remained in India, and he was also informed that the Government of India desired to be furnished with the reasons for the delay. In our telegram No. H-2921,tt dated 16th ttSorial No. 47. April 1916, the Director, Royal Indian Marine, was informed that it was presumed that all accessories for the dredger had by then been despatched to Basrah and he was asked to confirm this ++Serial No. 48. assumption. This the Director did in his telegram No. A. S.-730 3 tj;| dated the 17th April 1916. A report by letter§§ giving the causes of delay in commencing dredging and surveying operations in §§Serial No. 49. Mesopotamia was despatched by the General Officer S697(w)AD Commanding on the 3rd April, and on the arrival6 of Sir George Buchanan in Simla, during his deputation in India in April-May 1916, further * ^ • i n complaints were received* regarding the delay in despatch of the dredger and her stores, and bringing to notice negligence in the treatment of the stores both at Bombay and at Basra, fSerial No 51 Explanationsf were called for from the General Serial No. 52, Officer Commanding, Force ' D y ' the Director, Serial No. 53. Royal Indian Marine, the Embarkation Command- Serial No. 54. ant, Bombay, and the Government of Burma, who, the Director maintained, were to some extent responsible owing to the careless manner in J Serial No. 55. which the survey instruments and appliances and Serial Nos. 56. other stores were shipped at Rangoon. All the Serial No. 57. repliesj have been received and after due consider- Senal No. 58. ation it has been decided, in accordance with the recommendation of the General Officer Commanding, ' D,' to let the matter drop. The foregoing deals only with the dredger ' Oswald ' and her gear and the surveying launch es and equipment but in addition to the ' Oswald ' other dredgers have been obtained for Sir George Buchanan and the circumstances regarding them are given in the following paragraphs^ In his telegram No. 1382-1. Q.,§ dated the 17th February 1916, the General Officer Command- §Serial No 59 i n g intimated that Sir George Buchanan after personal inspection considered that by next low- water season ^reat improvements could be made in the river from Qurnah to Amarah and request^ ed that particulars be obtained of all dredgers of the same class as that then on the way front Burma but preferably one with a draught not exceeding 4 feet, and we were asked to treat the matter as urgent. The Maritime Local Governments concerned were then instructed to furnish complete descriptions of certain specified dredgers, and also if they had any suction dredgers other than those specified, to furnish similar information regarding them. On the 22nd February the action taken wasjl communicated to Force ' D,' who was informed^ liSerial No. 60. that exact requirements would possibly not be met by dredgers obtainable in India and that it was therefore proposed to make enquiries at home, and in order to facilitate these enquiries the General Officer Commanding was asked to furnish specifications, and to say whether it was- necessary that the dredger should be able to cut her own flotation. This information was ^[Serial No. 61. furnished by the General Officer Commanding in . his telegram^ No. 1382-4-Q., dated the 28th Febru ary lyib, but it was also added that Sir George was willing to adopt whatever Was available so- long as the draught was suitable. The maximum draught was put at 4 feet. In our telegram** ♦♦Serial No. 62. ^ 0 * ^-1734, dated the 6th March 1916, the Secre tary of State had the position explained to him r and was furnished with particulars of the type of dredger required, and asked to institute en- quiries at Home. Particulars regarding the dredgers available were despatched by the Govern ment of Burma on the 28th February, by the Government of Bengal on the 3rd and 4th March,, by the Government of Madras on the 29th February ; on receipt of these the Public Works Department were consulted in respect of the suitability of the various dredgers whose specifications and particulars had been forwarded to us. On the advice of the Public Works Department particulars regarding certain of the dredgers were forwardedff to the General Officer Commanding ttSerial No. 63. 011 March to enable Sir George Buchanan to select whichever dredger he considered would best meet the case. The General Officer Commanding was also informed that information had been received from the Consulting Mechanical Engineer, Montreal, Canada, that the Marine Department, Nigeria, West Africa, possessed a dredger — the ' Quorro ' — which he considered in every way suitable for the work required, and photographs of this dredger were furnished JJSerial No. 64. to General Officer Commanding. The action _ _ ^ .. taken was also communicated to the General Officer Commanding by telegram,$$ and about the same time the General Officer Commanding- was asked whether he required one or two dredgers in addition to the ' Oswald.' On the 14th f ^[Serial No. 65. March a telegram^ was received from the Secretary of State intimating that it was reported by the Naval Architect that the dredger Mudlark ' lying at Kotri on the Indus fulfilled approximately' the conditions required by Sir George Buchanan. The Secretary of State also added that a terminal pontoon and 300 feet of pipe-line for the dredger were under construction at Simons works at Home, that the dredger could make the voyage to Basrah if boarded up and properly strengthened, and that he knew of no other suitable dredgers, but that he was making further enquiries. If was also stated that if dredgers were specially built it was unlikely that they could be despatched so as to arrive at Basrah in less than 8 months from the date they were ordered. The Consulting Naval Architect's views in respect of the ' Mudlark ' were communicated to the General Officer Commanding in telegram No. 44991, dated the 23rd March 191.6, and alsoCD particulars of two otter dredgers wincli tlie Secretary of State liad subsequently intimat might be able to obtain. In his telegram* No. P.-53, dated the 30th March 1916, the General Officer Commanding intimated that Sir George Buchanan considered the ♦Serial No. 66. dredger ' Mudlark ' suitable, and recommended that she be got ready at once to ensure despatch before the monsoon and that the Secretary of State be asked to arrange to have the terminal pontoon and the pipe-line under construction at Home completed and shipped so as to arrive at Basrah as soon as possible an in an y case not later than the end of June as these were essential portions of the dredger equipment. It was added that the other dredgers mentioned by the Secretary of State were not considered suitable, but that the dredger ' Quorro ' appeared to be suitable and that if delivery at Basrah complete with pipe-line could be effected within three months he recommended that s e e in addition to the ' Mudlark.' The Director, Royal Indian Marine, was then instructedt to take immediately necessary steps to prepare the ' Mudlark ' ior the voyage to Basrah and to arrange for her despatch together with all available requi- to er ^ a !-S a «o sites with the least possible delay. The action X ena o. . taken in respect of the ' Mudlark 'was commum- catedl to the Secretary of State, who was asked to arrange for the completion and despatch of the terminal pontoon and pipe-line as desired by the General Officer Comman ing. e ecr ^ ^ of State was also asked to ascertain whether the dredger Quorro con . 6 • available, and whether arrangements could be made for her delivery a asra three months, and, if so, to arrange that such steps as might be necessary or er espa c taken. The General Officer Commanding was informed of the action taken. No reply regarang the 'Quorro' having been received from the § H.-2964, dated 17th April 1916 (Serial No. g ecretar y 0 f gtate by the 17th April, a reminder§ 69 ^ was sent. In his telegram No. S.-1095'2, dated the 18th April 191G, the Secretary of State intimated that the pipe-line and terminal pontoon for he dredger ' Mudlark ' could not be ready for shipment in less than two months and that its supply would cause a delay of about two weeks to two paddle tugs and asked for our wishe sin the r &gt; he also stated that he would furnish us later with information in regard to the ' Quorro. e Secretary of State was informed in reply that the paddle tugs should be given preference u that the pipe-line and terminal pontoons for the ' MuHlark ' should reach Basrah not la er an the end of July and earlier, if possible. On the 10th May we received a telegramU from e ^ . Secretary of State to the effect that in consequence || enal No. 70. 0 £ monsoon the delivery of the dredger ' Quorro ' at Basrah could not be effected before the end of September and enquiring whether he should proceed with its purchase. In our telegram dated the 14th May the General Officer Commanding, to whom the Secretary of State had repeated his telegram, was asked to let us know his wishes regarding the ' Quorro ' after consulting Sir George Buchanan. On the 23rd May the General Officer Commanding wired^j to say that Sir George Buchanan was of opinion ^ that the Dredger ' Quorro ' should be purchased eria 0 ' ' if there was a fair prospect of her delivery with pipe-line and other component parts by the end of September. The General Officer Commanding s No 79 reply was repeated** to the Secretary of State, who was asked to take necessary action. In his telegram No. 17002, dated the 5th June 1916, the Secretary of State reported that action as requested had been taken in regard to the ' Quorro ' and that delivery at Basrah was expected at the end of September. We have, however, quite recently been informed by the Secretary of State that the ' Quorro ' will not arrive at Basrah before the beginning of November. On the 16th April the Director, Royal Indian Marine, was asked to wire immediately what progress had been made towards the despatch of the ' Mudlark ' and when it might be expected to arrive at Basrah, and in our telegram No. 3000 of the 18th April he was asked to wire hrs proposals in respect of a crew for the vessel. It was added that it was essential that a thoroughly experienced European dredging master should be in charge and desirable that the then crew of the vessel should accompany her if available. In his telegram No, A. S.-725, of 17th April, we were informed by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, that it was the intention to utilise the ' Mudlark ' in assisting to tow the floating dock to Basrah. On the 29th April another reminder in respect of the progress made was sent to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, and in reply we were informed on the 2nd May that the ' Mudlark ' had arrived at Karachi. In his telegram No. Q. T.-410, to the Quartermaster-General the Director, Royal Indian Marine, reported that certain repairs were necessary to the ' Mudlark ' and in our H-3522, dated the 4th May, the Director was instructed to arrange that the docking and repairs to the vessel should be exe cuted as expeditiously as possible. A subsequent telegram from the Director, Royal Indian Marine, reported that considerable repairs to the vessels were necessary and that it would possibly be three weeks before she was fit for service. Sir George Buchanan who was inSimla at the time was apprehensive that the delay which would be entailed in executing the repairs to the ' Mudlark ' might greatly increase the risks of the voyage to Basrah. The Govern ment of India therefore considered that the repairs should be deferred until the dredger had arrived in Mesopotamia and that she should be despatched at the earliest possible moment. Instructions accordingly were issued to the Director, Royal Indian Marine. This was followed up by another telegram instructing the Director, Royal Indian Marine, to consult Sir George Buchanan on arrival at Bombay whether the ' Mudlark' should sail and the repairs be deferred until arrival in Mesopotamia, and at the same time the Marine Transport Officer at Karachi was directed to report urgently to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, the probable date of completion of the repairs. On the 9th May we received a telegram from Sir George Buchanan reporting that he had seen the Deputy Director, Royal Indian Marine, and recommended that'the despatch of the ' Mudlark ' be left to his discretion. Sir George added that the Deputy Director thought the repairs could be completed and the vessel sent to Basrah before the break of the mon soon and that under these circumstances it was preferable to complete repairs at Karachi, The Director^ Royal Indian Marine, was instructed to take action accordingly. The repairs were eventually completed and the ' Mudlark ' towed to Basrah, at which place she arrived on the 21st June. On the advice 'of Sir George Buchanan the Rangoon Port Commissioners were informed* on the 29th April that Sir George considered ♦Serial No. 73. that the Commissioners' dredger ' Cormorant ' would be suitable for the dredging operations on the outer bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab and that the Government of India would be grateful if the dredger could be made available in complete working order together with the dredging master and the whole of her crew for a period of from four to five months. It was added that if made available she should be immedi- mn 74 ately prepared for the voyage and despatched com- eria 0 ' ' plete with the least possible delay. On the 5tli May a replyf was received from the Port Commissioners stating that though it would be very inconvenient to spare the dredger they nevertheless wished to meet Government and were _ willing to hire her and asked for an assurance that J Sena o. giie should be returned to Rangoon by the end of November. In a telegram,^ dated the 6tli May, the Port Commissioners were informed that the Government of India approved the conditions and terms of hire proposed by them with one proviso, and they were asked to prepare the ' Cormorant' for the voyage to Basrah and to hand her over to the Principal Port Officer, Rangoon, complete in all respects and ready for despatch, with the least possible delay. The instructions issued to the Port Commissioners were communicated to the Principal Port Officer, Burma, who was asked to ascertain from them the approximate date the vessel would be handed over and to arrange for her despatch thereafter without delay, making arrangements for towage if this was necessary. This telegram was also repeated to the Director, Royal Indian Marine with the request that if it was considered desirable for the dredger to call at Bombay he would arrange for her onward despatch to Basrah as expeditiously as possible. On §Serial No 76. the 9th May the Port Commissioners wired§ to say that they could not undertake the responsibility of making the ' Cormorant' ready for despatch but were prepared to hand her over at once as she stood, and asked that instructions be wired to the Port Officer to take her over. Instruc- _ . , „ tions accordingly were issued to the Principal erla 0 ' '• ^ fort Officer in. Marine Department telegram No. H-4:008,|l dated the 16th May 1916. In his telegram No. 1020, dated 23rd May 1916, the Port Officer intimated that the ' Cormorant ' left for Basrah on the 23rd May, via Colombo and Bombay, with a full crew on board. The ' Cormorant ' arrived at Basrah on the 25th June. The sanctioned river conservancy works include :—■ (а) The dredging of the Hammar Lake. (б) The damming of the Michiriyah Canal and dredging in the Narrows. (c) Buoying the channels between Ali Gharbi and Sheikh Sa'ad. (d) Dredging the Outer Bar. The Hammar Lake. —The large dredger ' Oswald ' arrived at the site of operations on the 11th June and dredging was begun on the 23rd June, but owing to various causes not much progress was made in that month. The Director-General of Port Administration and River Conservancy, however, reported that it was anticipated that if the crew recovered from the effects of the intense heat, good work might be anticipated in July. The Narrows.- —Arrangements had been made to despatch at once a party in charge of an Engineer Officer to dam the Michiriyah Canal. It is anticipated that if the equipment of the ' Mudlark ' is found to be complete and can be quickly handled and put together, this dredger should do valuable work ir^ clearing the Worst channels between Qualet §alek an,d Eara'e Tomb.9 Good progress is being made with the Marine Surveys in this locality. Buoying of Channels between AH Gharhi and Sheikh Sd'ad. —-Arrangements were made with the Irrawaclciy Flotilla Company at Rangoon to send np a specialist employed on the Upper Irrawaddy in buoying difficult channels, to carry out similar wo k on the Tigris. The Irrawaddy Flotilla Company also agreed to sell three launches for £1,000 each, and remarked that they did so at considerable risk to communications in Burma, in order to assist operations in Mesopotamia. On the 27th June the Princi al Port Officer, Burma, telegraphe'd that the launches were 27 years old each and would require a very extensive overhaul before shipment if they were to be of any use on the Tigris. Under these circumstances, the Government of India on the re commendation of Sir George Buchanan cancelled the whole arrangements with the Xrrawaddy Flotilla Company, as it was obviously impossible for the launches to be ready in time for the Tigris work, more especially as the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company had asked for a guarantee that their officer should be back in Rangoon by the end of September. Arrangements are now being made to survey, if possible, the worst reaches with the exist ing survey staff. Dredging the outer bar of the Shatt-al-Arah.—At present the draft of vessels crossing the Bar is limited to 18' 6' and as every additional foot of draft means approximately another 500 to s of cargo, it has been decided to attempt to effect an improvement, however small. The ' Cormorant ' has been allotted to this work and was to begin operations on the 1st July. The Survey steamer ' Industry ' and survey party have been detailed to give the dredger her line and watch the progress. The Director-General in the course of June went over the whole line of communications, both in the Tigris and Euphrates fronts, and made preliminary arrangements for the carrying out of the works. All work during that month was carried out under great difficulties, owing to the tremendous heat, much sickness amongst the staff, a shortage of Engineers and a shortage of Marine Trans port. At times the entire clerical staff in the Director-General's office was laid up with fever and ^or a considerable period thcie was only one Engineer Officer, who, in addition to taking charge of all Engineering works, had to visit each ship which arrived with goods for the depart- ipient on board and arrange to take delivery and at the same time do the necessary correspond ence.

From—The General Officer Commanding, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D, ' To—The Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, India, Simla. With reference to your No. 11034-4, dated 30th July 1915 (not included in collection) forwarding the Government of India (Marine Department) letter No. H-6554 of 26th July 1915 (not included in collection), addressed to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, I have the honour to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and Government of India, a programme of the various river surveys drawn up by Commander C. S. Hickman, R.I.M., in charge of the Marine Survey with this Eorce. Tbis programme has been drawn up in consultation with the various branches of the Staff of this Force and I concur in the order of urgency therein proposed. The programme as submittted appears quite sufficient to fill one -season and I therefore do not think it advisable to include therein the survey of the new channel of the Euphrates. That channel is now sufficiently well known for all practical purposes and is not likely to be of value in any future operations ; for which better channels are now available. 2. The survey of the Shatt-al-Arab Bar would best be carried out by the Admiralty, as proposed in the telegram from Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla, dated 5th May 1915 (not included in collection), of which a copy is attached for reference. 3. I am not aware that there is any special need for the survey of the Shatt- al-Arab from Basra to Kurnah as the navigation of that portion of the river is comparatively simple, and unless its survey can be undertaken by the Admiralty I recommend that the next season's surveys be confined to the waterways men tioned in the programme, the improvement of which is of considerable importance. 4. With reference to the final paragraph of Government of India, Marine Department, letter already mentioned, I have decided that survey operations shall be suspended for the present and resumed after the 10th October next and would request that arrangements may be made for the survey party to return to Basra fully equipped for work by that date. S697(w)ADIt wou 1 d be a satisfaction to me if Commander C. S. Hickman could again be placed in charge of the Marine Survey here, provided such an arrangement does not interfere with his service prospects, as his personal experience and untiring energy render his services specially valuable. I would also ask that, if possible, either the ' Investigator ' or ' Palinurus ' be sent with the party as accommodation and transport for the survey party present difficulties.

(5) Survey of Muhammarah Bar and the Obstruction above, (c) Survey of the northern portion of Hammar Lake and channels to Euphrates. (TI is can be done when dredging questions are-nesrly completed.) (d) Survey of Shatt-al-Arab River, Basrah to Qurnah. Remarks with reference to above. A large plan of the Port of Basrah is necessary with a view to the improvement of the Port by dredging, the formation of wharves, piers, etc.; no systematic improvement can be made until the port is properly surveyed. (I would recommend a plan of 12 inches to 1 sea mile.) Muhammarah Bar and the Obstruction. —A survey oi these portions of the river would show where dredging is necessary, and give the position of buoys should they be considered necessary. Survey of the Hammar Lake. —Dredging can be started and continued in the Hammar Lake, the present sketch survey being sufficient, but a more detailed survey should be made afterwards.

Unless you consider it necessary, we suggest that survey be held over till Buchanan's advice has been obtained regarding these operations. Detailed survey aftei; dredging operations would presumably be necessary and be more valuable. (b) Survey Muhammerah Bar. —Agreed this would be useful but it would only take about three weeks. (c) Hammar Lake. —Hickman says water now too low for practical survey- ■ ing and suggests waiting until water rises in March. '{d) Survey, Basrah to Qumah. —Although Admiralty noted this as of first importance, Hickman sees no reason for this opinion in present state of operations as navigation apparently presents no difficulties and you concur with latter. Main difficulty connected with survey operations at present is provision of vessel for accommodation and transport of party. Neither ' Investigator ' nor Palinurus' available and Director, Royal Indian Marine, unable to help. Presumably at present you cannot spare a boat for the purpose. In view of above considerations regarding actual surveys contemplated and of possibility that later on difficulty of providing survey with steamer be removed, would you concur in postponing survey operations till, say, early in January, when surveys (a), (b) and (c), latter if still required, might be carried out straight on and as time permitted. This supposes that meanwhile you do not require survey party for other work. Telegram, No, 1.0.-1371, dated the 11th (received the 12th) October 1915, [Diary No. 23986.)

Particulars of each dredger as follows:— Length 205 feet; breadth 42 feet; depth 13 feet; draft of water about 8 feet 6 inches ; dredging depth 40 feet; dredging capacity 1,500 cubic yards stiff clay per hour ; bunker capacity 150 tons ; average speed 7 knots. Coal consumption for 10 hours dredging—Indian coal 27 tons, Welsh coal 22 tons. Pumps are driven by triple ex pansion engines of 3,000 indicated horse power and a cutter driven by one of the propelling engines is fixed in front of suction pipe ; dredger can cut her own flotation and a channel to depth of 40 feet. Dredgers are therefore suitable for both deep as well as shallow water opera tions. Pontoons to carry 2,000 feet of pipe line are available with each dredger but the discharge pipes are worn out and will have to be made ; 600 feet of pipe line-will be sufficient to meet the requirements in the Gulf. The above particulars were communicated to the Marine Trasnport Officer, Basrah, who has asked for the two dredgers to be sent and has also requested that0) a Mate or Master of their crews and three or four hands be despatched early in * advance to work expertly a small 'bucket dredger he has. Machinery of dredgers generally is in good condition but both dredgers and their appliances will ^ave to be put in thorough working order prior to despatch to the Gulf which will take at least three weeks.

Principal Marine Transport Officer, Basrah, has wired to Director, Royal Indian Marine, full particulars of the conditions which dredgers are re quired to meet and has asked if they will meet these requirements. Without seeing or trying dredgers offered it is impossible to say here whether they are worth price asked which seems very high for second-hand articles. I suggest that expert and unbiassed advice be taken on this point. Suggest also that price might include early delivery here in working order with efficient crews ; final purchase being deferred until after one month's trial. If found unsuitable, men and upkeep to be paid by Government until dredgers are returned at our risk and charges to Bombay. This refers to your telegram No. 8.^10428 of 19th May.

He has charted a channel which, starting from near Chahbaish, runs across the Lake westward to entrance of Hakika Creek, a distance of 18 nautical miles. At present there is a minimum depth of 7 feet of water, but a fill of about 3 feet may be expected during the next few months. With efficient dredging it could be maintained throughout the year as a reliable waterway. The entire bed appears to consist of hard mud with clay broken shelf covered with about 6 inches of soft mud. The two powerful dredgers should be purchased as early as possible.

From—The Viceroy (Amy Department), To—The Secretary of State for India. Tt has been reported by the General Officer Commanding, Indian Expedi tionary Force ' D,' that two dredgers are urgently required m Mesopotamia q improve the waterways there for military requirements. Two second hand dredgers have been offered by the Bombay Port Trust for scale at £52,000. These vessels are the Simons suction and originally cost £133,332 and were budt in 1908. They are said to be good sea-gomg vessels and came out from home originally without an escort passing through very bad weather. The Director, Royal Indian Marine, considers them suitable for the purpose for which required, also that the price quoted is reasonable, although both the vessels and their appliances require thorough overhauling. The machmery of the two vessels however is generally in good order. We have asked the Port Trust to let us have the vessels on a month's trial in the Gulf, the vessels, however, to be first put in thorough working order and equipped with efficient crews, and we have uudertaken to return the vessels at our risk and expense to Bombay if on actual experience they are found unsuitable. As we doubt that the Port Trust will agree to let us have the vessels on ap proval, we request your sanction to their purchase outright should it be necessary to do so. Your sanction to the cost of all repairs necessary to put the vessels in thorough working order is also requested. The Imperial Government will be debited with all the expenditure involved.

Dated the 14th December 1915. From— Sir George C. Buchanan, Kt ., C.I .E., M .I .CE., Serial No. To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. With reference to your H-9507, dated the 1st December, to my address, on the subject of my deputation to Mesopotamia in connection with dredging operations, I have the honour to inform you that as a result of my conference with Captain Lumsden, R.N., Director, Indian Marine, Bombay, I decided to proceed at once to Delhi to report. 2. I arrived on the night of Thursday, the 9th of December, and reported ^myself to you on Friday, the 10th of December. The same day, I had the honour of an interview with His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, and I now, in accordance with His Excellency's instructions, submit a note on the whole subject of the proposed dredging and other river conservancy work in Mesopotamia. Freliminary note on the proposed river conservancy operations in Mesopotamia by Sir George C. Buchanan, Kt., C.LE,, M1XJJE. It will he convenient to summarize briefly the action taken up to date. In April 1915, it was suggested that a dredger would be found useful in the Shatt- ^el-Arab river, and the Director, Boyal Indian Marine, was asked to correspond -with the Marine Transport Officer, Basrah, and the Officer-in-Charge, Marine Survey, on the subject. The Marine Transport Officer, Basrah, stated that the best type for work on the main river was a suction dredger with cutter attached, delivery pipe supported by 10 pontoons or alternately three hopper barges— range 22 to 25 feet. A shallow draft dredger was also urgently required for special work on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers—range 3 to 7 feet. The Bombay Port Trust offered for sale 2 dredgers, the ' Jinga ' and ' Kalu,' particulars as fol low •—Length 207 feet breadth 42 feet depth 13 feet, draught of water about 8' 6', dredging depth 40 feet, dredging capacity 1,500 cubic yards clay per hour, with bunker capacity 150 tons. Average speed 7 knots. Coal consump tion for 10 hours' dredging — Indian coal 27 tons, Welsh coal 22 tons. Each dredger was provided with cutter and could cut her own flotations and a chan nel to a depth of 40 feet. Pontoons to carry 2,000 feet of pipe line were avail able but discharge pipes were worn out and would have to be made. 2. The dredgers were considered suitable, and after some negotiations as to trial on hire iox a month, they were purchased outright from the Bombay Port Trust for the sum of Ks. 7,80,000 and sailed for Basrah on the 12th and 19th September, respectively ; provided with a certain amount of piping and pon toons to carry same and with the Dredging Masters and Chief Engineers who had worked them for the Bombay Port Trust. On the 30th October a telegram was received from Mesopotamia stating that certain accessories necessary for the working of the dredgers were deficient and urgently required, namely, 2 ter minal pontoons, shore piping, 2 barges for 5-ton steam cranes for raising anchors additional lengths of pipe line, and winches, and other details. The Dredging Master proceeded to Bombay to explain requirements personally and inquiries were instituted as to the possibility of obtaining gear in Rangoon. On the 26th November, the Director, Indian Marine, communicated the result of inquiries S697(w)AD10 at Eangoon for a terminal pontoon, the result being unsatisfactory, as tli Rangoon pontoon was for a different size of pipe to that used in the Mesopotami vessels. The Director, Indian Marine, also remarked that from conversation with the Dredging Master, there appeared no reason why dredging from channel in Hammar Lake should not be discharged m the lake as far away from the channel as the length of the pipe would admit, and that the terminal pontoons appeared to be required when-dredging in the river where the spoil had to be dis charged over the banks on either side, and that, under these circumstances, it both dredgers Were working in the Hammar Lake at the same time, the termma pontoons would not be required until the dredging of the river was taken m hand, and, for that purpose he suggested 2 terminal pontoons might be ordered m England, and anchor crane barges constructed in Bombay. 3. On the 21st November, the Government of Burma were informed by telegram that my services were urgently required to advise on dredging opera tions in Mesopotamia and on the 27th November, a further telegram was received directing me to leave Rangoon for Bombay on the 30th 'November where further instructions would be sent care of the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who wished a conference with me regarding dredging operations. 4. I arrived in Bombay on Sunday, the 5th December, and on Monday, the 6th, and Tuesday the 7th, I had long conferences with Captain Lumsden, R.N., Director, Royal Indian Marine, and also saw Commander Hickman, Royal Indian Marine, lately in command of the Marine Survey Party in Mesopotamia, and Mr. Spiers, the Dredging Master of the ' Jinga.' As a result of these conferences and consideration of the data placed at my disposal, I regret to state that I came to the conclusion the dredgers ' Jinga ' and ' Kalu ' were unsuitable for work in Mesopotamia, but, before stating my reasons in detail I would explain that there are many different types of dredgers divided into classes according to the work they have to perform and that the particular kind of dredger best adapted for any specified work is a matter calling for very special consideration, for example to place a light sand suction dredger to cut hard clay would be equivalent to using a racing motor-car for heavy transport and vice versa. The ' Jinga ' and ' Kalu' are clay cutting suction pipe line dredgers, built especially for the Sewri reclamation works recently carried out by the Bombay Port Trust. They have had an ample depth of water to work in, and the general conditions have been different to what might be expected in Mesopotamia. The reasons that, in my opinion, they are unsuitable for work either on the Shatt-el Arab or above Basrah are as follows (1) Below Basrah. —The principal bars On the Shatt-el-Arab are the outer bar; and the Mohammerah bar. To remove the outer bar, it is not possible without study to state whether dredging or training or a combination of both, would be most efficacious but, in any case, a pipe line dredger would, in my opinion, be unsuitable because apart from the difficulty of working any pipe line in an open roadstead it would, I think, be impracticable to use a pipe line of sufficient length to deposit dredging material far enough away from the scene of operations and undesirable lumps would probably form in the channel. With regard to the Mohammerah bar, it might be possible to work a dredger of the ' Jinga ' and ' Kalu' class provided that it was.' supplied with a suitable terminal pontoon and about 2,000 feet of pipe line, but the expense of the extra plant for this work only would be out of proportion to the results, especially as the dredger that is in all probability necessary for the outer bar could execute both works. (2) Above Basrah on the River Tigris and Euphrates. —The overwhelming : objection to the dredgers ' Jinga' and Kalu ' for work in the upper rivers is in my judgment their draught. It is stated in the specification that the ' Jinga draws 8' 6' which, in itself, is excessive, but the Master of the ' Jinga ' informed me that his vessels drew 10'9' forward, and that to keep the machine afloat and provide for silting he would require to dredge a continuous cut 14 feet deep below water level. This alone, I suggest, is sufficient condemnation of the proposal to use dredgers of this class for the upper river work where, in the dry season, I believe tHe depth of water in many places does not exceed 2 to 3 feet. It would, f course, be possible to hack a canal 140 to 150 feet wide by 14 feet deep across11 tliB Hamnmx Late, but 1 submit that the tiir/e aiid cost place sucli a project outside practical politics. It was possibly intended only to dredge during the flood season when there is plenty of water, in anticipation of the low Water, but 1 am of opinion that dredging with pipe line dredgers when the river is in high flood would be an exceedingly risky, indeed impracticable, proposition. The lack of terminal pon toons at the end of each pipe line, in any case, renders the dredgers useless for the time being, but in view of the grave difficulty in the matter of excessive draft, no action need now be taken in this matter. It will, however, perhaps be ol interest to describe the use of a terminal pontoon especially as the statement has been made that dredging through the H mmar Lake can be done without these appliances. A terminal pontoon is supplied to take the end of the floating pipe line which then discharges into a vertical pipe whence the material is lifted 20 to 30 feet and ultimately delivered over the bank of the river or canal at a distance of 80 feet or more from the side of the pontoon. In a deep river or tide way a terminal pontoon of this description is not required because the pipe line can be moved so soon as the end pontoon is likely to be inconvenienced by the mass of material, but m the case of the Hammar Lake where, in the dry weather, there would only be sufficient water for a very shallow draft pontoon, the material discharged, unless carried a long way clear of the pipe, would form banks around the pontoons and effectively seal them in. Another difficulty the dredging masters appear to be encountering in Mesopotamia is the lack of crane barges to lay and heave up anchors. A dredger of the ' Jinga ' and ' Kalu ' type operates by laying anchors ahead and working up to them by means of winches on the dredger, and the anchor gets so embedded in the ground that considerable force is required to pull it out. The usual size anchor is 20 to 30 cwt., and they require a crane barge considerable power, but the Dredging Master informs me they have been supplied with some 50 cwt. anchors which materially increases the work. I see from 'the papers that one of the dredgers has actually been operating on the Qumah Bar, and in the absence of a terminal pontoon, the material has presumably been discharged astern of her pipe line. This is a matter which requires great caution and a surveyor at work the whole time, as, if there is. any current, it is possible that a series of bars may be formed for miles down the river. In this connection, I may point out that the control of dredging operations is seldom entrusted to the Dredging Masters in charge of the machine. It is usual for an experienced river engineer, assisted by surveyors, to direct the work and watch its progress from day to day. 5. Description of the 'proposed fiver conservancy works. —I now propose to discuss the various improvement works which suggest themselves to me, after studying the notes, plans, and other data which have been placed at my disposal, and I will divide the subject into two heads, namely, the Tigris and Euphrates above Basrah, and the Shatt-al-Arab below Basrah. 6. The Tigris and Euphrates above Basrah. —I would here remark that im provement works above Basrah are presumably to be considered as temporary and in connection with military operations only, the immediate objective being the maintenance of a good low water channel between Basrah and Nasiriyah on the Euphrates (via Qumah) and Qurnah and Amarah on the Tigris. 7. The question of permanent communication between Baghdad and Basrah will be for the future, and, as navigation and irrigation seldom go hand in hand, it will, in view of the great importance of the latter, probably be decided to make a railway the principal means of transit between these two important centres. I understand the first obstruction above Basrah is the bar which one would naturally expect to find at the junction of the Euphrates (old channel) and Tigris at Qurnah: There should be no difficulty and no objection to dredginp- a channel through with a suitable machine. Between Qurnah and Nasiriyah I gather it is possible to get, even in the low water season, as far as Chahbaish from Qurnah, and Suk-esh Sheyukh from Nasiriyah, leaving difficult gap of nearly 30 miles, 10 of which are taken up in the crossing of the Hammar Lake. It is not possible, without investigation on the spot, to express an opinion of any value as to the best means of improving the navigation in this locality, but, no doubt, a good deal could be done with suitable light draft dredgers. As regards the Tigris, I am informed there is water throughout the year between Baghdad and Amarah' but, from the latter place to Qurnah, navigation is extremely difficult at low water.12 As in the case of the Euphrates, investigation on the spot is the only means of ascertaining what improvements', if any, could be effected. The deficiency m water is largely caused by the various streams which take off from the Tigris, and it might be practicable temporarily to bund some of these by dams formed of brush wood stakes and mud, 8. The Shatt-el-Afab at, and below, Basrah.^Any works between Basrah and the Gulf may be considered of a permanent nature in the interest of trade and the development of the country, and, although they will possibly not be executed, or even seriously considered during the continuance of military opera tions, I suggest an opportunity should be taken of obtaining the data for a future project. I understand it is an open question whether Basrah or Koweit will be the terminus of the Baghdad Railway, and, consequently the chief port of the pro vince and, as this is presumably solely an engineering question, data might be obtained to settle this point, but, in any case, the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company demand that the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab should be removed, and I see no difficulty in carrying out this work, although an engineering survey will be necessary to decide upon the best and most economical means to adopt. On the assumption that Basrah remains the chief port, the bar at Mohammerah requires removal and presents no great difficulty. Preliminary plans can also be prepared for the improvement of the Port of Basrah by the provision of suitable wharves, and warehouses for sea-going steamers and pontoon landing stages for river craft, very much on the lines of the extensive works carried out in Rangoon during the last 10 years, and although not directly connected with river conservancy, I would remark that the scales of tolls and charges, the method of conducting the traffic and general administration of the Port of Rangoon might be used as a basis for the administration of a port situated amidst such similar circum stances and surroundings. 9. Method of giving effect to proposals. —-On the assumption that my proposals are generally approved and that it' is recognised that the dredgers already purchased are unsuitable for Mesopotamia, I make the following suggestions for the carrying out of the work :— {i) It is, in my opinion, of the first importance, that a small but thoroughly efficient and properly equipped staff of Engineers be engaged at once to make, under my advice or direction, the necessary surveys and investigations, in order to carry out at the earliest date such works as are possible for the assistance of military operations. (ii) Although it is not practicable, without some study on the spot, to say where a dredger will be found useful, I recommend that, in the first instance, one light draft suction pump dredger should be obtained and sent at once to Basrah as it is courting failure to defer making arrangements for the dredger until it is actually required, more especially as there would be a considerable amount of work to do on the machine after arrival at Basrah before a start could be made. On the assumption that the above proposals receive approval, I make the following sug gestions as to detail. 10. -Experience has taught me that the best men obtainable, even although their salaries are large are the mos^ economical in the long run, and that for urgent work they are essential. I propose that the staff comprise 2 Engineers of proved ability and energy and a survey party of subordinates. I can name 2 Engineers who have worked with me in Burma and in whom I have complete confidence, and I think a survey party could be obtained from the Rangoon Port Trust as, owing to the completion of a large Marine- survey, a number of men could now be spared. In the matter of equipment, 2 steam launches for the sole and entire use of the party are a sine qua non. I am informed nothing of the kind is available m IVIesopotamia, and I believe these might be requisitioned, from Burma if unobtainable elsewhere. Minor equipment such as boats, sur veying appliances and instruments should also be arranged for beforehand, so that no time will be lost in getting to work as soon as the party arrives at Basrah, and, when the military requirements have been satisfied, the same party could carry out the preliminary surveys I have indicated as desirable at Basrah, on the Shatt^ el-Arab and at Koweit,13 11. Dredger. —The style of dredger I should prefer for work on the upper rivers is one in common use in America—a suction-pump, fiat-bottomed, strong vessel of very shallow draft, but I am afraid there is nothing of that exact type in India or Burma, the nearest approach being the shallow draft suction-pump dredgers at present being used by the Government of Burma dredging the new Twante Canal at Rangoon. The particulars of two of these are as follows :— Length between perpendiculars 210 feet; breadth over aU 39 feet; depth 9 feet; draft in fresh water with 50 tons of coal in bunkers, 30 tons«of water in tanks and ready for work 5' 3'; speed 8 knots per hour. Each dredger is capable, under ordinary working conditions, of excavating 780 cubic yards per liour of sand or soft clay from a depth, of 40 feet below water level, and delivering the spoil through a steel pipe line 800 feet long to a height of 20 feet above water level. Each dredger has a complete installation of electric lighting, including search lights, and is supplied with a workshop provided with screw cutting lathe, drilling plant, and planing machines, forge, anvil, bench vice, and complete set of blacksmith's and fitter 7 s tools. This dredger would be of no use for work below Basrah, as a different type must be required for the bar on the Shatt-el-Arab. 12. If the foregoing proposals are generally approved, I suggest for consideration that it would probably actually save time if I returned to Rangoon and personally supervised the collection of men, materials and plant, as I should then be satisfied that nothing essential was overlooked or forgotten. I would further suggest for consideration that all matters connected with river conservancy operations in Mesopotamia might perhaps with advantage be transferred from the Port Officer and Marine Transport Officer, Basrah, to the new department, which would work under the direct orders of General Nixon. I may say I discussed this point with Captain Lumsden, Director, Indian Marine, and understand he would entirely approve of the proposed transfer. 13. In conclusion, I recommend— (a) That I should be given authority to proceed to Rangoon and obtain on transfer from the Burma Government one of the dredgers referred to above. (b) To secure a dredging master and crew complete. •(c) To arrange for despatch of the above with all necessary accessories, viz., pontoons, pipe lines, etc., to Basrah at the earliest possible opportunity. (d) To arrange for obtaining two suitable launches- (e) To arrange for the following staff, viz.— Tw o Engineers, one of whom I hope to obtain in Burma, and a survey party of from six to ten subordinates. i (/) To arrange for the purchase of minor equipments such as boats, survey ing appliances and instruments. With reference to (e) above as regards the other Engineer who would be my principal assistant I strongly urge that if possible the services of Mr. L. W. Lewis, Superintending Engineer, New Delhi, maybe placed at my disposal. This officer lias worked with me in Burma on very difficult river works of this description. He lias my entire confidence and I attacb the very greatest importance to obtain his services if only for a few months. D elhi : \ GEO. G.

I suggest that, if the proposals are approved, Mr. Niven may be given facilities, through the local Government of Burma and yourself, for communicat ing with me by telegram on any points that may arise or may suggest themselves to him. Proposals for Engineering and Surveying Staff and Equipment for Port and River Works in Mesopotamia. Staff—I propose that Mr. E. C. Niven, Executive Engineer, Eiver Conserv ancy Department, Rangoon Port Trust, be offered temporary employment as Chief Engineering Assistant to the Director-General, salary Rs. 1,500 per mensem plus usual travellftig allowances when away from Headquarters, and that Mr. C. E. J. Pascoe, at present Second River Surveyor, Moulmein, Burma, be offered tem porary employment as River Surveyor. He is a Government servant and the Burma Government will presumably make their own proposals in the matter of pay. Surveyors. —I consider Mr. Niven should be directed to select a small service able staff from subordinates at present under his control in Rangoon. I suggest Mr. Nagg, as First Surveyor, two other native Surveyors, and a Draftsman; also leadsmen and boatmen. Mr. Niven can be relied upon to do all that is necessary and the local Government might be requested to obtain from him the estimated total cost per mensem, exclusive of his salary, and telegraph the same to the Army Department. Equipment. —Two launches are essential. I should wish to have the Rangoon Port Commissioner's survey launch ' Industry ' as one of the launches, and leave the selection of the second launch to Mr. Niven. It should be of as shallow draught as possible. The ' Ethel ' lately in use by the Public Works Depart ment on the Twante Canal might do, or a shallow draught paddle boat if one can be obtained. Both launches will probably require to be towed from Rangoon. Some rowing boats and sampans will be required, which Mr. Niven can select, and possibly they could be put on board the dredger for conveyance to Basrah. In the matter of minor equipment, sounding lines, chains, poles, instruments, etc., etc., Mr. Niven may be trusted to get together all that is necessary; he can possibly hire them from the Rangoon Port Trust. Dredger. —There are three dredgers at work in the Twante Canal, Burma, ■which are the property of the Burma Government. They are called the ' Oswald ■15 the Campbell ' and the ' Lees.' I propose that either the ' Oswald ' or the ^ Campbell ' be requisitioned and despatched to Basrah. She should be complete m every respect as per her specification, with electric light and searchlights in good order, workshop completely equipped and with 800 feet of pipe line complete with pontoons and terminal pontoon capable of discharging 20 feet above water- level. An anchor boat is also necessary, but I will write further in respect to the dredger and its equipment from Basrah when I have had an opportunity of re viewing the situation. In the meantime, preparations can be made for the dredger sailing, but she should not be actually despatched until my further report has been received- The pontoons, pipe line, terminal pontoon, etc., must be taken to pieces and shipped by cargo steamer. I attach great importance to Mr. Renfrew, at present Dredging Master on the dredger ' Lees,' being appointed Dredging Master on the selected vessel, and he should choose his own officers and crew.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Burma, Rangoon. Clear the line. —Reference correspondence ending with your 122-W., December 1st. Sir George Buchanan is very anxious to have services of Mr. E. C. Niven, River Conservancy Department, Rangoon Port Trust, as Chief Engineering Assistant, Mr. C. E. J. Pascoe, Second River Surveyor, Moulmein, employment as River Surveyor in Mesopotamia. Government of India hope that Port Commissioners will kindly meet Buchanan's wishes regarding Niven. Please wire if services of these officers can be made available and if they accept offer of appointmentr Salary of Rs. 1,500 per mensem flus usual travelling allowance suggested for Niven, Government would be pleased to receive your recommendations in respect of salary considered suitable for Pascoe. If Niven accepts Buchanan desires that with permission of Port Commissioners he should be directed to select small serviceable staff from subordinates under his control in Rangoon and suggests Nagg as Eirst Surveyor, two native surveyors and draftsmen, also leadsmen and boatmen. This staff should bring with them complete equipment of surveying requisites. Niven should place himself in direct telegraphic communication with Buchanan, whose telegraphic address from about 1st January will be care of Base Commandant, Basrah. For dredging operations of vital importance Buchanan asks for either the ' Oswald ' or ' Campbell,' the Government of India are aware that these dredgers are employed on the Twante Canal, nevertheless, as there is no other dredger in India suitable for the work in view they are constrained to ask that one of them may be made available together with Dredging Master, crew, and complete equip ment of electric light, workshops, 800 feet of pipe line complete with pontoons and terminal pontoons. If feasible Buchanan would prefer Renfrew from u Lees' as Dredging Master of the dredger selected. If dredger can be made available pre parations should be made for her sailing and for dismantling of pontoons, pipe line and terminal pontoon for despatch by cargo steamer, but nothing to be actually despatched until you receive further intimation. It is suggested that Burma should be relieved of all charges in connection with dredger including interest, depreciation, etc., from date of stopping ^work ing until date of return to Rangoon. If Local Government agrees, please wire approximate monthly charges on account of interest and depreciation. Should also be glad to receive your proposals regarding salaries of Dredging Master and members of crew while serving in Mesopotamia, as also of officers and subordinates accompanying Niven. Owing to need for every kind of craft Government of India are compelled also to ask you to make available two launches. Buchanan suggested Port Com- jpjssioners' survey launch ' Industry ' as one and for the other a light draught16 Serial No. 34. paddler, either ' Rebel 'or' Brigand ' would be suitable. LaunAes wfll probably require to be towed to Basrah and as their services are required immediate^, it trusted that their prompt despatch can be arranged for by Principal Port Officer in. direct communication witli Director, Koyal Indian Marine. Niven should arrange for such sampans and small boats, as can be accom modated on the launches and dredger. The arrangements in charge of which Buchanan is being placed are con sidered vital to success of the military operations in Mesopotamia and the Gov ernment of India trust that it will be possible to meet these requirements in fr.lL Telegram No. 6662 r dated the 25th December 1915. y rom _Tlie Chief Secretary to the Government of Burma, Rangoon, To The Secretary to the Grovernment of India, Marine Department.

They also agree to our having Dredging Master, complete equipment and crews, as well as two launches, some sampans and small boats for dredging operations in Mesopotamia. Buchanan promised to communicate further as regards the dredger and its equipment after reviewing the situation ; he thought an anchor boat would also be necessary. His advice was to the effect that until he furnished a further report the dredger should not be despatched. On 31st December Burma wired as follows: — Begins. tl Work is being put in hand for the despatch of the dredger when ready, probably in about a month's time ; arrangements have been made for dismantling pipe line terminal pontoon and preparing dredger for sea.

The delay in collecting and forwarding from Bombay the dredge^ ' Oswald ' and component parts is causing me anxiety as the cutting of a channel through the Hammar Lake is of great importance. The dredger left Rangoon 15th January (17th January ?) with launch ' Rebel' in tow and launch ' Industry steaming alongside and all arrived at Bombay on 11th February. The dredger was detained in Bombay for certain renewals estimated at Rangoon to take one week to do and no advice of her departure has been received. The pipe line of dredger and other gear left Rangoon 17th January in steamer ' Oolabaria ' and no further news has been received. The terminal pontoon left Rangoon either on 7th or 15th February being towed by steamer Okla ' which vessel had also on board the anchor pontooons for laying out dredgers moorings and no further news has been received. Heave up boat was to have been placed on deck of first transport left Rangoon after 13th January but there is no advice of her despatch from Rangoon.

Serial No. 45, From—The General Officer Commanding, Force ' D, ' Basra, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Delhi. The continued delay in forwarding the dredger Cf Oswald ' and component parts will certainly render the cutting of an efficient navigable channel through the Hammar Lake impossible in time for this year's low water season beginning in August. Sir George Buchanan's programme was based on the dredger being at work within 3 months from the date she was ordered, that is to say, work would be now beginning and judging from the date the plant left Rangoon, the estimate was a reasonable one. The dredger left Rangoon on 15th January and arrived in Bombay on February Ilth. It was not supposed she would remain there more than a week and the Director, Marine, was informed by telegram that the greatest importance was attached to the earliest possible despatch of the veessel. The- dredger left Bombay on March 4th and was given a paddler to tow. She arrived at Karachi, on March IOth (13th ?) and no further advice has been re ceived. The whole of the pipe line and equipment left Rangoon on January 17th for Bombay and the Director, Marine, telegraphed that arrangements would be made for transhipment to Basra about the 1st February, but the material is only now arriving and in small consignments. Twenty-nine pontoon floaters arrived at Basra the 11th instant, but were unaccompanied by the fittings and anchors and chains, so it is impossible to erect and float even bne pontoon. The terminal pontoon left Rangoon on the 7th February along with the anchor pontoons for laying the dredger moorings and they arrived at Bombay on the 24th February. The terminal pontoon left Bombay for Basra on the 8th March, but there is no advice of the despatch of anchor pontoons or the remainder of the pipe line and other gear. Director, Marine, was telegraphed to on the 11th March asking when pipe line and anchor pontoons might be expected, but no reply has been received. Please endeavour to arrange immediate despatch of all material still in Bombay and telegraph date of sailing and name of transport; likewise kindly note that the non-arrival of any of the component parts of complete set of dredging plant which was despatched from Rangoon renders it impossible to begin work as nothing omitted can be procured locally.

G eo . C. BUCHANAN, and River Conservancy, I. E. Force 44 D.*'21 emorandum on Delays to River Conservancy Work in Mesopotamia due to non- receipt of Plant, Material and Survey ^Equipment from India, and to local inability to supply temporarily Inspection and Survey launch. 1. On the 17th December 1915 I furnished the Government of India with detailed proposals for an Engineering and Surveying Staff and Equipment which I proposed to obtain from, Burma and the Government of India approved of my proposals and in a telegram to the Government of Burma said the work I was to be engaged upon was of vital importance to the success of military operations in Mesopotamia. 2. The Government of Burma did all that was possible to assist in the matter, my staff was engaged, a survey equipment purchased, and a large dredger em ployed on an important public work in Burma along with three launches were jplaced at the disposal of Force ' 4 D.'' 3. I arrived at Basra on the 1st of January and was informed that it would be necessary for me to make all arrangements for equipment and personnel and that I should demand from India everything I considered necessary, unless I considered it desirable to defer all surveys, dredging work, etc. I replied that I was doing all in my power to collect staff and material as I fully realised that all available craft was required for military purposes and I had ordered from India one dredger and three launches, that there could be no question of deferring surveys or dredging work unless my craft were lost en route, and that it was matter for regret the surveys were not put in hand six months ago. I also telegraphed to Mr. Niven (my Chief Assistant) emphasising the necessity for his bringing everything with him from Rangoon. 4. I represented on my arrival the urgent necessity for my going up the river to inspect personally the sites of the works I was to carry out and asked if a launch could be made available for a matter of ten days but owing to the paucity of launches and military necessities I was unable to proceed until the 20th January when the launch allocated to the Chief Political Officer was placed at my disposal. I did not however get more than a few miles beyond Qurnah as the boiler burst on the morning of the 21st January and after drifting for thirty hours I got a tow back to Basrah. The launch was repaired but the boiler burst again on the 1st February. I then wrote to General Cowper and asked if it would be possible to spare another launch and said that if none were available I should very reluctantly have to give up all ideas of making my inspection before the flood season, which would mean I could form no ideas for improvements before the next low-water season. It was then arranged the launch ' Shushan ' should be placed at my disposal and I proceeded on tour on the 14th February, inspected the Tigris to above Amara and the Euphrates to Nasiriyeh, returning to Basra on the 24th February, 5. The subordinate staff and the survey equipment left Rangoon on the 14th January per S. S. ' Orna ' and arrived in Bombay on the 22nd January, where they were to have been met by an officer of the Marine Department and transhipped to the Basra steamer. Mr. Niven left Rangoon overland on the 18th January and arrived at Bombay on the 24th January and found no arrangements had been made for transhipping the survey equipment from the ' Orna.' The result was that the subordinate staff left Bombay on the 25th January, arriving at Basra on the 31 st January. Mr. Niven arrived on the 5th February and the equipment on the 15th February. As I had given Mr. Niven specific orders to meet the staff and equipment in Bombay and accompany them to Basra I asked him for a written explanation and received a reply (Appendix I) which I considered acquitted him of any blame in the matter. S697(w)AD6. The S. S. ' Havildar ' bringing the equipment arrived on the 15th Feb ruary but delivery of the equipment did not begin until the 29th of February an on the same day the ' Havildar ' sailed taking a large portion of my equipment back to Bombay (see Appendix I). 7. A light draft paddler called the ' Rebel' had been specially selected to convey the survey party and operate on the river above Basra. This boat lett Rangoon on the 15th January being towed by the dredger (as she was quite a small light craft) and with the launch 'Industry' steaming alongside^ They arrived at Bombay on February 11th and on the 13th I telegraphed to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, that the greatest importance was attached to the despatch at earliest possible date of the dredger and both the launches. 8. The launch ' Rebel' arrived at Basra on the 4th of March, but as the floats for the paddles, the roof and the cabins had been left in Bombay, she was a useless hulk. These fixtures had left Rangoon on the 17th January per ' Oolabaria ' and the Director, Royal Indian Marine, had stated they would be transhipped from Bombay about the 1st of February. At the date of this note, i.e., 28th March, the gear has, I believe, arrived but delivery has not been given. 9. The launch ' Industry ' arrived in Basra in good order on the 4th March, but was not intended for work above Qurnah, being of too deep draft. 10. The dredger 'Oswald' arrived in Bombay on the 11th February and was detained for renewal of a pump casing. This should have been done m Rangoon; in fact it was in course of execution; when the Principal Port Officer stopped the work and despatched the dredger. As without this renewal she would probably have broken down in the Hammar. Lake I insisted on the work being done in Bombay, but I understood it was only about a week's job. The dredger left Bombay on March 4th, but as the dredging master reports that the engineers in the dockyard did all they could to push on this work I accept his statement. 11. The dredger on leaving Bombay was given a heavy paddler to tow and took six days to reach Karachi. The dredging master was then prepared to refuse to leave Karachi until he had communicated with me, but the Transport Officer, Karachi, on his own responsibility took off the tow and the dredger proceeded alone, arriving at Basra on the 21st March. 12. The pipe line of the dredger consisting of about a thousand feet of 24- inch diameter piping with pontoons 40 inches in diameter, anchors, winches and other gear measuring 640 cubic tons left Rangoon on the 17th January per ' Oolabaria ' and on the 18th January the Director, Royal Indian Marine, tele graphed that arrangements for transhipment would be made about the 1st Feb ruary. It is not apparent why the ' Oolabaria ' should not have proceeded direct to Basra more especially as no transhipment was effected on the 1st Feb- tuary. Some pipes arrived on the 11th March and it is believed the remainder of the material was shipped on the ' Braunfels ' due here in the first week of April. The dredging master, who was fully alive to the necessity for all the pipes to arrive in Basra before the dredger, as there was a geat deal of work to do in rivetting them together, has reported to me on the subject and has stated he was not allowed to communicate with me. His report is appended (Appendix II) and I suggest his statement might be made- the subject of inquiry as, if correct, it would appear that no attempt was made in Bombay to forward promptly the plant. 13. The terminal pontoon left Rangoon on the 7th of February, arrived in Bombay on the 24th February and left Bombay for Basra on the 8th March per the ' Bhadra,' which has not yet arrived in port. 14. The nett result of the delays aforesaid is that it is now impossible for me to carry out in time for the next low-water season the whole of my programme of work on the rivers above Basra.The works comprise :— (a) the dredging of a channel across the Hammar Lake, (b) the improvement of the Tigris between Ezra's Tomb and Qualat Salih and the delays in execution will be attributable to delay in arrival of plant and to inability to make the necessary surveys. 15. With regard to the dredging of a channel across the Hammar Lake I estimated that the dredger would be at work three months after the date of order, that is to say, work would be now about ready to start. I can see no reason why that estimate should not have been fulfilled to the day, if the pipe line and other material had either been forwarded direct to Basra, or been transhipped with reasonable speed from Bombay, as in that case the pipe line and pontoons would have been erected and rivetted and awaiting the arrival of the dredger. As things are, material which the dredging master when in Bombay urged should loe ship ped at once, and which the Director, Royal Indian Marine, had previously said would be shipped about the 1st February, was, according to the last advice, to be possibly shipped on the 24th March and may therefore be expected here about the first week in April. As nothing can be done towards even erecting the pontoons until all the parts have arrived-and been delivered, I estimate that it will be impossible to begin dredging at earliest before the beginning of June, and if, as seems possible from the dredging master's report, any of the parts have been lost there will be further delays. There is ten miles continuous dredging to plough through across the Lake and several miles each side to partially dredge, and at three miles per month I estimated that by beginning at the end of March or first week in April, I should just get through some time in August, but two months' delay upsets all calcula tions. It cannot be said that the delay in shipping was due to the using of all space for urgent war necessities because, to take an example, I have seen landed many tons of iron sheet piling which now that I am in charge of wharf construc tion have been handed over to me, and for which no urgency of any kind exists. 17. In the matter of the improvements on the Tigris I have already pointed out that in hydraulic engiaeering, surveys are all-important, and works can only be designed after careful surveys have been made. My programme contemplated having my staff and surveys equipment here by the beginning of February and trying (after they had made a survey at Margill), to procure something to take them up the river pending the arrival of my survey steamer. Owing to the delay in forwarding the equipment from Bombay, the return of part of the equip ment to Bombay and my survey steamer arriving minus paddle floats and cabins, no surveys of any kind were begun until the 14th March and the party only left to-day for the Tigris survey and then in an imperfectly equipped condition (Appendix 3). It is also matter for regret that owing to lack of transport I was unable to inspect the river before the 14th February as it is now almost too late to procure the small dredgers which an inspection at once showed me would be beneficiaL I have, however, designed the weirs to check the flow of the Tigris into canals during the low-water season and I have heard of one small dredger which it may be possible to get up before the advent of the monsoon. 18. In conclusion, I would say that my staff and myself will do everything that is humanly possible to expedite all the works, but .we feel that these delays have deprived us of the power of making them the success which might have been reasonably anticipated. Basrah : 28th March 1916. GEO. C. BUCHANAN, Colonel, Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy,!. E. Force ' ZX'24 APPENDIX No. I. Office of the Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy, 53 Strand Road, Basra. No.74-A.-16. The Srd March 1916. To The Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster General. Memorandum. The accompanying papers on the subject of the treatment by the Marine authorities at Bombay and Basra of my survey equipment are submitted. 2. Briefly the facts of the case are as follows :— When I was appointed to my present office the Government of India asked me to inform them in detail of my exact requirements in plant, personnel and equipment and on receipt of same Mr. E. C. Niven, an Executive Engineer in the service of the Rangoon Port Trust, was appointed my chief engineering assistant and was instructed to get together a staff of subordin ates and complete survey equipment. 3. On my arrival at Basra I found nothing could be procured locally and I was informed by you in your No. 1179 -I-Q., dated 5th January, and that it would be necessary for me to make all arrangements for equipment and personnel in regard to the execution of any work I might have to undertake and that it was understood this was being done. I accordingly telegraphed to Mr. Niven emphasizing the necessity for his bringing every thing necessary for a complete survey equipment and said that neither men nor appliances could be obtained locally. 4. Mr, Niven carried out my instructions to the letter and a complete survey equipment was purchased (at a cost of Rs. 15,000) which was very carefully packed and despatched to Bombay per steamer ' Orna ' which left Rangoon on the I4th January 1916. The Government of Burma asked the Government of India by telegram to kindly arrange for the reception of the equipment and persomiel in Bombay and their transhipment for Basra and presumably this was done, but when Mr. Niven, who travelled overland from Calcutta, arrived in Bombay on the 24th January he found that the Marine authorities had taken no action whatsoever and did not even know that the steamer from Burma had arrived on the 22nd January. 5. From that date our troubles began and instead of my specific instructions being carried out and Mr. Niven, his staff and equipment arriving together on the 31st January, the staff arrived on that date, Mr. Niven arrived on the 5th February and the steamer ' Havildar ' with the equipment anived on the 15th February. 6. With reference to the partial discharging of the ' Havildar' and the deliberate departure of the vessel with portions of my equipment on board as lucidly described in the notes of Mr. Niven and Captain Lakin my feelings are such that I have no words that I can respectfully put on paper. 7. I would point out that the loss of portions of my equipment is of grg,ve importance as an Engineer's instruments, drawings, materials and so on, are to him what a rifle is to an infantry man or ammunition to a battery and we can no more do our work without these necessaries than a modern battle can be fought without rifles and ammunition. I might add that as all the oars have been returned to Bombay I cannot even use the survey boats brought from Rangoon with such care and forethought. 8. I have been given to understand that it is of considerable importance I should contrive to improve river conditions for the low-water season, but as I have pointed out in my note dated 2nd March on river conservancy operations I can do nothing until I have had some surveys made and under existing conditions the prospects of getting my staff to work seem remote. It is possible that in this emergency the D. D. Works, the Officer in charge Surveys and the Superinrendent of the Dockyard might between them furnish material to enable me to carry on, pending 'the return of the material from Bombay, and I suggest that the urgency ofthe case be represented to these officers and they be directed to assist me to the best of their ability.25 I would further suggest th.at a telegram be despatclied to the first port at which the &lt;£ Havildar ' stops requiring the remainder of my equipment to be at once discharged and forwarded to Basra by the first steamer with a special covering letter in the charge of the Commander to be delivered to me on his arrival. 9. In conclusion I would remark that under existing methods of traffic management at the port there seems no reason why a recurrence of this incident should not take place and perhaps when the timber arrives for the Margill jetties half of it will be left in the steamer and be returned to India. In this connection I may mention that the working drawings of pontoon landing stages, fixed jetties and wharves for which I telegraphed to Rangoon some time ago and which I require in connection with the new wharves here were in one of the cases the ' Havildar ' has taken back to Bombay. 10. I shall be obliged if these papers may be laid before the Army Commander for favour of perusal and orders. (Sd.) GEO. C. BUCHANAN, Colonel, Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. ANNEXURE No. I. To £*sr*, tt/&amp; ■ The Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. Memorandum. With reference to your No. 21-A.-16, dated 9th instant, I think the following explanation will make it clear that the piecemeal arrival of myself, the staff and the survey equipment was brought about by causes which were not within my control. 1. On January 8th the Government of Burma telegraphed to the Government of India, Marine Department, asking thenj to arrange for the transhipment of the survey staff numbering 44 persons and equipment from Bombay to Basra and on the 14th January sent a further wire saying that the party and equipment had left on the date on the steamer ' Orna ' and were expected to arrive in Bombay on the 23rd January. 2. On January 18th, I left Rangoon for Bombay via Calcutta and arrived in Bombay on the 24th January. I was met at the station by the Surveyors, who informed me that they arrived in Bombay on the 22nd January but no one met them on the ' Orna ' or made any arrangement for their housing and it was only after appealing to the Commissioner of Police that the party was provided with accommodation in one of the rest camps. The survey equipment meanwhile had been discharged at Victoria Dock and from a subse quent inspection I made it was obvious that no care or supervision had been exercised in the process. The equipment consists largely of carefully adjusted instruments, and to avoid their being damaged or unnecessarily handled I had them stowed in Rangoon on the top of the ' Orna's ' cargo. To instance the lack of care to which these cases .were treated in Bombay I might mention that I found one of them being used as a loading platform for carts removing goods from the quay. The care bestowed on the equipment up to its arrival in Bombay was completely undone by the careless treatment it received there. I reported the matter to Commander Huddleston who told me that the Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company were entirely responsible and that we should claim damages from them. It is clear however that, had the Royal Indian Marine, Bombay, arranged for the transhipment of the equipment according to the instructions, this would not have happened and I cannot see that the shipping Agents are in any way responsible. 3. On arrival in Bombay I reported to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who informed me that the ' Orna ' with the staff and equipment had not yet arrived, but had been signalled down the coast. Captain Lumsden only credited my report of the ' Orna's ' arrival on my informing him that I had actually seen the staff. 4. I then got in touch with the S. E. 0. and found that all arrangements had been mad 6 for myself and the staff to leave for Basra on the Transport ' Edavana ' sailing the following day, i.e., Tuesday, 25th January. I pointed out that I coud not possibly leave without seeing the equipment off and at my request the Director, Royal Indian Marine, wired to the Quarter master General, Delhi, asking his approval to my remaining behind in Bombay for this purpose S697{w)AD26 and sailing by tlie mail for Basra on tlie 29tli January. This was agreed to and the staff sailed by the Edavana ' on Tuesday, 25th January. 5. The Survey equipment, as I have pointed out, was discharged from the ' Orna ' by the ship s staff on the 23rd January^—the date stated by the Government of Burma in their telegram but the Marine not bing aware of the steamer's arrival in Port took no action and thereby the chance of shipping the equipment with the staff on the ' Edavana ' was lost. Commander Huddleston informed me that there would not be another transport to Bombay for some considerable time, but I pressed the urgency of the matter upon him and he arranged in consultation with Commander Douglas for the ' Havildar ' to come into Port and take our equipment to Basrah via Karachi. This arrangement was made on the 27th January and I was told by Commander Douglas that the equipment must be alongside J;he ' Havildar ' on the following day, otherwise it could not be accommodated. As regards the actual transfer of the equipment from the Victoria to the Alexandra Dock, was informed that Commander Douglas would see to this, but on reference to that officer I found that he only dealt with stores delivered alongside the transport and he suggested I should write to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, and get the assistance of the Marine Store-keeper, ims was done and I understand eventually the Commissioner's Contractor effected the removal 0 the equipment. I went to the dock and personally inspected the transfer of the equipment, ut would point out that this was not work which I should have been called upon to do when a so many other matters connected with the dredger to discuss and arrange with the Chief Constructor of the Dockyard. , J*' ^ c ^ n s ^ a ^ e with assurance that had I not remained behind to arrange for the transhipment ot tne equipment that even more serious delays than those we are now faced with would have occurre . Had prompt action been taken on the arrival of the ' Orna ' on the 22nd, to tranship tne equipment I consider it could have been placed on board the ' Edavana ' and brought to -Basra along with the staff and myself. 7. In the matter of the dredger ' Oswald ' I would also like to point out that at the eleventh our o my stay in Bombay Captain Hordern informed me casually that the dredger was not coming into Bombay to have the pump casing renewed as had been definitely arranged but would proceed to Basrah from Colombo. I immediately wrote to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, an ma e i perfectly clear that if this were done I would accept no responsibility for the working ciency o e dredger in Basra and that your orders were definite, i.e., that the vessel was to arrive m perfect working condition. The Director accepted my views, but it is plain to me that 1 6611 o* 1 the spot and pressed the matter we would have had the ' Oswald ' arriving ofThlUrLake cas ^ n ^ an( ^ a ser i ous breakdown probable when she was in the middle (Sd) E.

For your information! would like to state that what impressed me most on visiting the fC Havildar ' was the lack of supervision and consequent atmospl ere of indifference that enveloped the unloading operations. Empty mahelas were to be seen lying alongside and no attempt being made to load them other mahelas were leaving short of full loads ; briefly it seemed to be no one's business to see either that the carkgo was unloaded or that the mahelas were being used to the best advantage. Then delay in discharging the ' Havildar ' was largely due, in my opinion, to lack of supervi sion, want of method and shortness of working hours. It is frequently stated that such like delays are due to a shortage of lighterage craft, but the origin of the trouble is lack of system and if the working hours were increased and good supervision employed the mahelas might be found to be sufficient in number. As things are now the lighterage craft is not used to the best advantage and it will continue to be inadequate until system and method are incorporated in the proceedings. One cannot reasonably look for perfection in a Port during a state of war, but the introduction of a few simple business ideas would transform the present chaos into reasonable order and one would not look for more in the circumstances.

To The Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. Memorandum. As directed, I submit the following statement of my endeavours to get all our surveying equipment off the ' Havildar — The ' Havildar ' arrived in Basra late on the 15th February last. On the morning of the 16th I went on board to see about getting the equipment ashore. The Chief Officer told me that he would discharge our things as soon as some clothing, which was on top, was removed. I left a clerk on board to check and ?ally our packages as they were dis charged. On the 17th I again went on board and found that, except for about a couple of boilers for steam launches, nothing had been discharged, and that there was not a single mahela along side the vessel. I then went and saw the Officer Commanding, mahelas, who said he would arrange to send down a couple of mahelas to take our things. In the evening I went on board with the assistant to the Officer Commanding, mahelas, and found that our boats and sampans had been discharged into a mahela, which was ordered to go to Ashar Bridge. On the 18th I again went on board. There were then several mahelas alongside but nothing of our equipment was to be seen. The hold appeared to be full of bhoosa and some timber The Chief Officer remarked to me that we were the only people who were worrying to get their consignments off the vessel. I then went and saw the M. L. 0. and told him that I had been on board three days running to get our equipment, of which we were in very urgent need, and had not been able to get anything as it was under a lot of bhoosa and timber He said he would see about it and would do what he could.29 My visit to the Havildar ' on the 20th proved equally futile. There were four empty mahaylas alongside, and still nothing of any of our cases or packages was to be seen. I was informed by the clerk of the ship that all the bhoosa would be discharged that day, and we would get our equipment the next day. When I went on board on the 21st I found only one mahayla, almost fully loaded with bhoosa, alongside, and the vessel flying the signal for mahaylas. Besides the bhoosa there was -some timber and a small boiler in the hold. ^ In \ W€n ^ on board and found that all the bhoosa had been discharged, and the hold contained a great amount of timber and steel pilings. Nothing of our equipment was to be seen. On the 24th there was still no sign of any of our things. On the evening of the 26th I again visited the ship and was told that we may get some of our cases tomorrow. My next visit was on the 28th when I saw some coils of ropes and some bamboos belonging to us, the remainder of the equipment being still buried under some timber and steel pilings. The Chief Officer informed me that the vessel was sailing the next day, that they would work all night, and that everything would be discharged by noon the next day. On this visit I noticed 19 mahaylas and one iron barge alongside the vessel. Throughout the time the vessel was in Basra I always had a clerk and two men on board during the hours the vessel was working. On being informed that she was leaving next day and would be working all night I arranged for reliefs for our men on board during the night. I have no personal knowledge of the happenings on board just prior to the departure on the 29th as I was on other duty that day, but they are being reported by the Assistant Director, Incidentally I may mention that on the evening of the 29th while searching for the mahayla 'containing our equipment I met the Assistant Officer Commanding, Mahaylas, who gave me every help in examining and searching several of them for our gear. I asked him what the tindal of the mahalya would do in the event of his not receiving any specific instructions as to the destination of the gooas in his craft. He replied that in that case the man would probably take his mahayla to some out-of-the-way place where it would be difficult to find him. ,«697(w)AD (Sd.) 0. LAKIN, Captain,80 APPENDIX No. 2. Dredger ' Oswald,' Basra,. 24th March 1916* Colonel Sm Geotge Buchanan., Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the arrival, of the dredger at Bombay I went to' report to the Deputy Director, Eoyal Indian Marine. At the same time I asked for money to pay my staff for the month of January. The Deputy Director told me he knew nothing about us except that they were to fit the new pump also that Sir George Buchanan should have made arrangements himself as to our pay. That he considered the changing of the dredgers a waste of money. They had already fitted out two. dredgers and had spent three lacks of rupees in fitting them out and now these same dredgers were being sent back as useless. 1 pointed out to him that I was only a subordinate and knew nothing about this matter. I must say that the gear belonging to the.dredger and pipe line was handled in a very hap hazard manner. I don't know whether Bombay was to blame for this or not,,some of the cases containing spare gear are missing. One case was found in the hold of a paddle steamer that was fitting out. Two days before the dredger sailed I found another case and a number of plates and angle irons belonging to the- floaters lying in a comer oi the dockyard. I got my crew to put the case, on board the dredger and to.put the plates,and angle irons into a barge where a lot more of my gear was in. When we arrived in Bombay all the floaters were in the Dock and no one seemed to bother about them. As I had no authority to speak about the gear being there, I did not know what arrangements you or Mr. Niven had made also the attitude the Deputy Director took up when I reported my arrival prevented me from interviewing him again. As Mr. Niven told me verbally also in his letter which he left for me at Bombay that the dredger must be ready for work as soon as she arrives at Basra and nothing was being done to despatch the floaters and gear belonging to them I thought the only way out of it was to wire you for instruc tions but I am sorry to say I let it stand too long, I should have done that on my arrival at Bombay. I wrote.out the following telegram and took it ug to Mr. Knight, Inspector of Machi nery, he asked me to leave it with him and he would put it up before the Deputy Director. T saw Mr. Knight afterwards and he informed me that Commander Hordorn sent his compliments and that everything was .being done to get the gear, to Basra. The Marine Storekeeper informed me that his instructions were to give the E : ;I.M. Stores the preference in shipment. .1 received every assistance in looking-for gear from Mr. Knight and his Assistant Engineer and they worked to get the dredger away with all possible speed., The Dredger was not properly ' made fast till they started work taking out the old pump and they worked night and day when possible till;it was finished. As the closing length of pipe for discharge side of pump did not fit a new castipg had to be made for same. They also fitted a new sleeve on the impeller. I wrote to the, Staff Officer, R, I. M., informing him about the missing cases and the contents of same, I herewith enclose reply, I also beg to state that the Chief Accountant, R. I. M.,, gave me all the money I asked for to enable me to pay my officers up to the end of February.. I will render a statement of all money drawn and payments made to each officer. When we left Bombay we had the Paddle steamer ' Damukdia' No. 21 in tow. Owing to this tow it took six days for the dredger to reach Karachidn fine weather, and the consumption* of coal was 18 tons per day, steam was difficult to keep in the Boiler., The consumption of coal between Rangoon and Bombay was^4 tons per day. Owing to excessive delay being caused to the dredger I told; the Navigating Officer in charge that I did not intend to leave Karachi with the tow until I got instruction from Sir George Buchanan which I intended to telegraph for from Karachi. The Transport Officer at Karachi on his initiative took the Paddler from us and after;- coaling we came on to Basra alone. Copy of telegram which I intended sending— Sir George Buchanan, c/o Base Commandant, Basra., Please wire Dockyard to tave floaters and all gear from same sent at once to Basra, itr is imperative fchat this should he done as it will take time to put floaters together. No one seems to have had any instruction what to do here, except fit new pump. (Sd.)

(11) Engine room tools and equipment. With the exception of item 5 (cabin on the main deck forward) the ' Rebel ' arrived here minus the whole of the above equipment and consequently useless for our work or indeed for any purpose ; as the launch was required for urgent work, which would not admit of waiting until the ' Rebel's ' gear arrived from Bombay, the marine dockyard was asked to fit her up. The ' Rebel ' has now been handed over to us as ready for survey work, but she only been provided with part of the equipment as follows :— (1) Paddle floats, (2) Sponson deck, both sides, forward and aft, (3) Rough timber cabin on bridge deck, which admits sunlight and rainthcough the openings between the roof boards. (4) 'W. C. and bath-room on bridge deck, and is therefore still far from being complete for survey purposes. I would point out that the engineering surveys on which the ' Rebel ' is to be engaged will have to be plotted as the work progresses and to suit this purpose the usual practice is for the bridge deck to be converted into a drawing office. In the absence of a bridge roof and side curtains this is impracticable and in my opinion the launch is now only adapted for the roughest of survey work. As the first survey is to be made near Amarah I am counting on getting accom modation in a building there for plotting the field work. It has been suggested that a launch as ordinarily equipped for conveying troops, is suitable for survey purposes and that the extras required for the ' Rebel' are really luxuries ; the suggestion is unwarrantable. I may say the survey stag are not looking for luxuries but simply for the ordinary conve niences with which all river craft here are provided. The survey party will consist of at least one, sometimes 2 British offiers, 3 Native Surveyors, 2 Sounding boat recorders, 2 gauge readers, and about UO boatmen, sampanmen, and leadsmen, in addition to the ' Rebel's' crew of 14 hands. This does not include an armed escort which it is understood will be required and for which some space will have to be provided. It is obvious that with the ' Rebel ' in her present condi tion practically the whole of the survey party will have to remain in the open day and night and as this is a mode of living to which they are not accustomed it would probably result in many of them being incapacitated by sickness. As it would be impossible to replace these trained river Surveyors it is of great importance to the whole of our work that they be kept fit and efficient, but we cannot hope to achieve this with the ' Rebel ' in her present condition. , .

From— Colonel Sir George Buchanan, Kt ., C .LE., M .I.C .E., Director General oi Port Administration and Kiver Conservancy, I. E. F. ' D, ' Mesopotamia, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, Simla. I have the honour to invite a reference to letter No. 1142-12-Q., dated 3rd April 1916, from the General Officer Comnwiding, Indian Expeditionary Force &lt;£ D,' to the Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, .Simla, forwarding notes and a letter from myself with enclosures on the subject of delays to River Conservancy work. 2. It will be observed from a perusal of the papers th?&gt; + some of my complaints imply a lack of method in Port Administration ; and I desire to explain that the delimitation of my d.uties by General Sir John Nixon was such that I have only held the office of Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy in name. 3. I enclose a memorandum I have drawn up on the subject, with enclosures, and I respectfully request that the same be laid before the Government of India for orders. In this connection I desire to emphasize the fact that I have not written the memorandum from a personal point of view but solely in the interest of military operations, because if the administration of the port and river is efficient for military purposes my position is not of the smallest importance. 4. I have, however, in the course of my three months' experience in Mesopo tamia formed the opinion that without better organization in the near future, military operations may be seriously hampered and I feel that I should be failing in my duty did I not lay my views before you along with my reasons for same. Memorandum on three months' work in Mesopotamia? with some observations and suggestions by Colonel Sir George Buchanan, C.I.E., Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. On the 17th December 1915 I was instructed by the Government of India to proceed to Basra at the earliest opportunity in order that .1 might be in a position to give immediate assistance to General Sir John Nixon in all matters connected with the Port of Basra, its administration, engineering works, and river conservancy. The instructions of the Government of India were that my duties were to- be defined in consultation with myself and by holding the interview and proceed ing to define my duties before I had been given an oppoitunity of seeing the work before me, and, further in the presence of and in consultation with the P. M. T. 0., I was placed at a disadvantage. The interview was brief. General Nixon had beside him a paper on which was drawn out a list of various things I should not do and he remarked, that he did not understand the title of my appointment as there was no port to Pjdminister. The wharves and jetties were purely temporary for military purposes and all he required me to do was to see if improvements could be effected on the Tigirs and Euphrates to assist military operations. Sir John said he did not understand with what the Admiralty were frightened at as he had no intention of dredging the outer bar. 1 explained shoitly my interpretation of the orders of the Government of India and why I had been sent up in such haste, but Sir John Nixon dissented and repeated that all he wanted me for was the improvement of the River Tigris and the Hammar Lake on tje River Euphrates, but that it would be advisable for myself and staff to collect data for future civil works in case Basra was added to the British Empire. I replied, that under these circumstances, as I had no launch to take me on a preliminary inspection of the rivers, and was informed I could not get one, I might as well return to Bombay and thence to Burma as originally proposed, but General Cowper intervened and said he would try and borrow Sir Percy Cox's launch for my use. j.he interview then terminated. In due course I receivedwritten orders as to my duties and found that the constractioiTof some r wharves had been added to General Nixon's verbal programme, but as I did not think that the orders of the Government of India had been correctly interpreted I wrote a memorandum in reply and asked that the correspondence might be sent to the Government of India for perusal and record (Appendix A). * * * Hs * Hs * * River Conservancy. (8) I was asked by a staft officer at Basra if river conservancy had anything to do with sanitation, and I will therefore explain that under the term river con servancy is included the management of a river and the execution of all the work tlierecn, i.e., the regulation of traffic and drafting of rules in connection with same and the dredging^, training, lighting, and surveying of the entire river along with the construction of all necessary works. As in the case of Port Administration, there are various officers making independent suggestions with the inevitable result that there is a general lack of efficiency. (9) My most important works in connection with military operations were to dredge a channel across the Hammar Lake and improve the facilities for naviga tion on the Tigris, and it was agreed when I left India that the dredger from Burma should not be despatched until I had made a preliminary inspection of the locality where she had to operate. I was unable to carry out this arrangement because for reasons beyond my control I did not complete my inspection until the 24th February. My report is dated the 3rd March 1916 and is appended hereto (Appendix D). I was obliged to order the dredger before making any inspection so that its arrival in time for work would be possible, but although the dredger and all its component parts left Rangoon about the middle of January, the pipe line and other fittings had not all arrived at Basra when I left on the 4th April. I have reported fully on this matter and also on - the delay on beginning my surveys and my reports have been forwarded by the Army Commander to the Chief of the General Staff, Simla (Appendix E). (10) In this connection I may say that I saw Captain Lumsden the Director of the Royal Indian Maine, when I was in Bombay on the 13th instant., and I had some conversation with him on the subject. Captain Lumsden, whilst regretting the delay, said that when all departments were asking for priority in transport it was difficult for him to satisfy the numerous demands, and he said that my officers in Rangoon were responsible for the dredger requiring extensive repairs in Bombay, and that the pipes, and pontoons were despatched from Rangoon in three steamers and were so badly packed that they had all to be sorted out on arrival at Bombay. (11) With reference to these remarks I beg to make the following observa tions :— [a) My officer in Rangoon had absolutely nothing to do with the dismantle ment of the dredger and packing of the pipe line and pontoons, his instructions being to confine his attentions to the engagement of the survey stafc and collection of the equipment. The whoje of the work in connection with the dredger and pipe line was done by the local officers of the Royal Indian Marine and the officers of the Public Works Department. I was aware that the dredger required renewal of the pump-casing. This was actually being done in Rangoon under the superintendence of the Public Works Department, but I am informed the Indian Marine Officer at Rangoon through some misapprehension stopped the work and despatched the dredger to Bombay. In the matter of the alleged despatch of the pipe line and pontoons in three different steamers I incite a refernece to telegram No. M.-169, dated the 18th January, to my address which reads as follows :— Begins. ' Principal Port Officer, Rangoon, wires January 17th. Begins. ' Oolabaria ' sailed to-day towing 4 Myittha.' ' Oolabaria ' has on36 board whole of pipe line of dredger 4 Oswr.ld' consisting of 40 pipes closed at each end and 36 feet by three and a half diameter weighing two and a half tons each. Twenty pipes open each end 40 feet by two and a half diameter weighing one and a half tons each. These pipes have projections on them which make towing difficult. Numer ous other plant for dredging proposes. List is being posted. Also roofs and gear for ' Myittha ' and ' Rebel.' Whole measures about six hundred forty cubic tons. Ends. Cargo for dredger will be transhipped in Bombay about first February. 'Myittha's' tow will be arranged onwards same date.' Message ends. As already stated I fail to understand why the whole of the pipe line and pontoons should not have been despatched direct to Basra from Rangoon instead of laboriously transhipping at Bombay. * * * ^ « * ' * * O bservations a^d suggestions. (15) After three months' experience and close study of local conditions, I have formed certain opinions which I put down for what they may be worth. It being understood they refer solely to work in connection with the port and river. (a) Field Service Regulations, Chapter 2, paragraphs 4—6, say : The essence of all efficient organization lies in due sub-division of labour and decentralization of responsibility among subordinates, each individual being given duties which he can perform adequately. At the same time central control and co-operation of subordinate parts for the attainment of the common objective must be assur ed. At Basra, there is, in my opinion, not only insufficient decentralization but there are three or four officers trying to perform the same work, and individuals are given duties which they cannot perform adequately because they lack the necessary knowledge and experience. * * * * * « * ^ ^ (d) Writing impersonally I have formed the opinion that my services have not bewi utilised to nearly the extent contemplated by the Government of India and sufficient importance has not been attached to the specific works I was called upon to perform. Moreover, I have been obstructed, and I know that to be the 0 f in !? n ? . r 61 . 0 ^ ^ S . ald S ? ^ tiie course of an interview I had with him shortly before I left Basra. At this interview I stated that I had felt for some time that I was not wanted, my work was not considered urgent and mv advice on matters concerning which I have expert knowledge was brushed aside, that I l ^ Present the reputation of being a man who would get things done what the odds and I did not wish to bury my reputation in Mesopotamia. rliff 1 d0 ^ Pr0P ffi Se t0 j? ame an y individual officers in connection with the in difference to my office and work, as the orders issued by Sir John Nixon in respect to my duties are responsible for my services not being fully utilized -and so W as those orders stand I shall remain more or less of cypher I cm certairdy po-biliti.. o, m J, The evils tuZySt.^To St J, give even TrSto between Amarah and Ezra s Tomb, which I need not point Lt wfuld be atr/ would have been a reasonable prospect of ro^n] A f^ Kan S 00n t 0 Basra, there by 6 (below ih.37 tlie montli of August. That is now impossible and as there is no time to build a railway or a road, Nasiriyah will be to a large extent cut off for the greater part of the low-water season. (16) In conclusion I may say that as directed I am availing myself of the opportunity together a great deal of information which will be of service after the war, and when my investigations are completed, I shall be in a position to report fully on the following subjects (1) The removal of the Bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.

With reference to your No. 1179-1-Q., dated the 5th January 1916, detailing the points on which my advice is required I attach herewth a further note on improved transport facilities between Qurnah and Amarah on the Tigris and Qurnah and Nasiriyeh on the Euphrates. (Sd.) GEORGE CT BUCHANAN, Colonel, Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. further note on proposed River Conservancy operations in Mesopotamia after an inspection of the rivers concerned. In my preliminary note dated 14th December 1915, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, I discussed various proposals for the improvement of navigation .on the rivers Tigris and Euphrates above Basra and on the Shatt-al-Arab below Basra after studying such data as was available, but I pointed out that in the absence of any engineering surveys an investigation on the spot was the only means of ascertaining to what extent, if any, improvements could be effected. (2) I arrived in Basra on the 1st January 1916, but owing to the great scarcity of river craft and the urgent demand for all available vessels for military purposes I was unable to get outside Basra until the 14th February 1916, a delay much to be regretted but which under the circumstances was unavoidable. I have, however, now had an opportunity of making a personal inspection of those portions of the rivers requiring immediate treatment, and I submit this further note on the understanding, however, that the views expressed herein are subject to confirmation or otherwise when surveys have been made. The Tigris between Quma and Amara. (3) Sir William Willcocks in his book 'The Irrigation of Mesopotamia 'stated that the very existence of the Tigris as a river was threatened in this reach by various large streams which took off from the main river and in three specified cases he designed waste weirs with crests 50 centimetres (19' 68 inches) below low-water level in order to retain the bulk of the low-water flow in the Tigris proper. These weirs were to be solid masonry and the estimate for the three was about £45,000. I am in entire accordance with Sir Wlliam Willcocks' diagnosis and I propose to put in hand working surveys of the various canal junctions 'at the earliest date. (4) I noticed on my inspection the usual bars and difficult crossings which one would expect to find on a river flowing through an alluvia] plain and also a number of awkward bends and I can quite understand that in the low-water season, navigation between Ezra's Tomb and Qualet Salih is extremely difficult. I noted six places where engineering surveys required and these will be made as soon as possible. (5) When all the surveys enumerated above are completed, I will consider the practicability of executing the following works :—■ (а) Lowering by judicious dredging of the various bars and casement of awkward bends. (б) Construction of temporary emergency weirs for the next low-water season which will keep the bulk of the low-water flow within the Tigris. (6) To carry out {a) some small light draft dredgers are an absolute necessity and in a sepa rate communication I have described the type of machine required. . y™ 1 w f ^. ence .i'/. 6 ' is Ileither Il0r desirable within the next few months to con struct bir William WiUicooks permanent weirs, but I propose to build temporary structures of months mattresses which will, I think, serve their purpose for the low-water The Euphrates between Qurnah and Nasiriyeh. w i 7 '/ 11 'T b ° 0,!: Sir Wlcocka haa described the bursting of the right bank of the Euph, ptps whereby for 110 kilometres (68 miles) the Euphrates has no bed at all and has its main89 junction with the Tigris at Grarmat Ali 40 miles below old junction at Qurnah and in connection with his irrigaion scheme he proposed to allow the whole of the water of the Euphrates to find its way to Garmat Ali but to restore the right bank from Qurnah and join it to the left bank at oukess Sheyukh at a cost of £70,000, thus ensuring the passage of the spill water of the Tigris down the old channel of the Euphrates to Qurnah. (8) For the purposes of navigation we must look at the matter from a different point of view, our immediate objection being the establishment of a channel whereby river steamers could na vigate at all times of the year between Basra and Nasiriyeh. At the present time the Euphrates flows in a well-defined channel from its source to the neighbourhood of the town of Sukess Shey ukh some 80 milts in a direct line from Basra but 5 miles above Suk a channel called the Haquikah takes off from the Euphrates, whilst below Suk the Euphrates divides into the Mezlik and tJmm akhalah channels and various streams. These channels spread fan wise and are lost 10 miles below Suk in vast shallow lakes and swamps extending to Garmat Ali and Basra which in the low-water season are only 2 feet deep in parts; that is to say, navigation is limited to native boats. (9) The problem before us is to make a channel through the lakes, and so far as depth of water is concerned, I can discover little to choose anywhere, but the distance across varies con siderably^; thus from Garmat Ali to the mouth of the Euphrates is about 60 miles, but from Qurnah along the old bed of the Euphrates there is a deep well-defined channel to a point called Chabaish whence the distance across the Hamar Lake is about 15 miles more or less according to the channel taken on the opposite side. Under the circumstances, therefore, the best course to take is via Qurnah to Chabaish and thence across th% Hamar Lake. (10) From the entrance to the lake which is about 8 miles from Chabaish two courses are open as a channel can be cut either to the mouth of the Mezlik or Haquikah channels respec tively. The Political Officer at Suk (Captain Dickson) with whom I had a long and more interesting conference emphasized the desirability of making the Mezlik the main channel to Nasiriyeh for the following reasons :— (a) The Haquikah is, comparatively speaking, a new channel and any works resulting in an increased flow of water will be at the expenses of the Mezlik channel and result in many acres of ground being thrown out of cultivation. This was recognized by Turks who placed a dam across the Haquikah channel but for military pur poses the dam has been removed. (b) The country through which the Mezlik flows and irrigates with its water is one of the richest in Mesopotamia, but the people are exceedingly turbulent, possessing many good rifles and abundant ammunition. It is believed that improving the channel whilst increasing the area under cultivation will also improve the character of the people as there would be a constant passage of traffic in front of their doors. (11) I made a close inspection of the Mezlik channel from Suk to the bar at the Hamar Xake and whilst appreciating greatly the views of the Political Officer, I am of opinion that for military purposes the Haquikah is the best channel to adopt. For the last few miles, the Mezlik channel is so shalloW and tortuous that a great deal of work would be necessary to render it navigable in the low-water season for vessels of three feet draft, whereas the Haquikah, which also inspected personally, is a fine straight fairly deep channel throughout. I also explored the Umm N-akalah channel which takes oS. from the Mezlik and flows into the Lakes and swamps south of the Hamar lake. This channel is really the Euphrates' new 'bed and appears to carry more water than any of the others, but gets exceedingly tortuous and narrow as the outlet is reached. (12) Having inspected all the channels I propose to make the cut from Chabaish to the mouth of the Haquikah and one dredger of a suitable type is at present en route from Burma, the cutting of the channel will be a tedious task and I fear it will not be possible to do more than 3 miles per month at the utmost. A survey is required before the exact line can be decided upon and if for military purposes great importance is attached to the work a second dredger of similar size could possibly be obtained from Burma, but before coming to conclusion on the subject I should like to discuss the situation with the dredging master of the vessel which I hope will arrive in Basra shortly as the entire proposition is a novel one. Summary. (13) To sum up I do not think that any heroic engineering works are required either on the Tigris or Euphrates to improve navigation temporarily for military purposes, but any40 permanent sclxeme of rivet conservancy works will require more extensive surveys and study than it is possible to give at the present time. If I can set men and appliances I lave every hope of getting a greatly improved chamael between Qurnah and Amarah in the low-water season and also have the cutting across the Hamar Lake well in hand. What is principally required is organisation and concentration of energy in proper places, in short to use an Indian colloquialism a good bandobast. (Ui There is a great deal more survey work, to do than I was led to expect and I have sent a requisition to India for more surveying instruments and for another ™ rve y 0 t L * emphasise the fact that in hydrauUc engineering, surveys are all important as the position of a dredged channel on a river like the Tigris has to be selected with great care after the survey has been made. (15) As I shall have three survey parties at work simultaneously I shall be very short of river transport both for surveys and for conveyance of coal and stores to the dredger^. I have coming from India one moderate draft steam launch, one shallow draft paddler and one steam pinnace, but it is quite impossible^for me to cany out all the works. I have enumerat ed without a good steamer for working on the Hamar Lake and a motor boat for surveys on the lake. I therefore request that the ' Shushan ' or similar steamer be placed at my entire disposal and that sanction be accorded to the purchase of a motor boat. The latter I have had offered me and have purchased, subject to sanction, from Messrs. Strick Scott and Co. as per details attached. I may say that as I shall have competent men in charge I have no fear of the launch break ing down. My deeper draft launch can tow barges with coal and stores as far as Qurnah and the Shushan ' from Qurnah to the lake, but I wish to make it quite clear that without the service of the 'Shushan 'or equivalent I cannot carry out the work entrusted to me. I ask for nothing extravagant either in the way of men or appliances and have left so smalt a margin that very little will make the whole difference between success and failure. General remarks on transport service on the Tigris. (16) I have been asked verbally whether any limit can be placed on the number of river transports that can be accommodated on the river and in my judgment there is no limit within reason, but I consider the transport service requires organisation and institution of traffic rules and regulations. The usual rule of the road is that steamers going up the river give way to steamers coming down because the former are naturally under better control, but I understand this rule is not enforced. With large increases in the number of river transports some crossing stations will possibly be required and a comprehensive scheme carefully drawn up. I would point out that a perfect transport service depends upon the following (1) sufficient number of steamers, (2) adequate means of repairing and maintaining vessels, (3) a navigable river at all times of the year, (4) competent management of the transport service by one responsible officer, and if all these are not co-ordinated there will be failures and breakdowns. With reference to (4) I would suggest that whoever is in charge of the management of the transport service should also issue orders for the upkeep and maintenance of the vessels as divided responsibility in this case would militate against efficiency. The Shatt-al-Arab helow Basra. With the large amount of work before me at Basra and on the rivers Tigris and Euphrates I regret that I see no immediate prospect of taking up the question of the conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab and removal of the Fao-Mohammerah bars, but the survey work will put in hand so soon as any of my staff can be spared.

Office of tlie Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy, I. E. Force ' D.' Basra, 1st April 1916. To D. A. and Q. M. G. Memorandum. With reference to my memorandum No. 149-16 forwarding a note on tlie delays caused to tlie River Conservancy Operations in Mesopotamia due to non-arrival of plant I beg to make tlie following additional and supplementary remarks. Dredger and Component Parts. On the 30th March when Lieutenant Grant and Mr. Renfrew, the dredging master, were in the R. I. M. Dockyard, Mr. Renfrew by chance came across a number of indispensable fittings belonging to the dredger. Enquiries were made and the Storekeeper informed Lieutenant Grant that he did not know what the fittings were or to whom consigned and that he had intended putting them on the scrap heap on the following day to make room for his stores. The Storekeeper was informed as to the nature of the goods and the officers departed making arrangements to take early delivery. The following day I personally inspected the fittings and found 42 pieces there. The same afternoon Major Niven and Lieutenant Grant in the Dockyard noticed our gear had disappeared ; they asked the Storekeeper who said he knew it. It then occurred to my officers to go to the scrap heap, and on proceeding to the waste piece of ground across the road from the dockyard they found there dumped on the scrap heap the missing gear. Comment on an episode such as this seems unnecessary. Return of a portion of my Survey equijcment on the 14 Havildar.'' In your telegram No. 1111-46-Q., dated 3rd March to Chief of General Staff; Delhi, you gave me a list of the cases and packages not cleared from S. S. ' Havildar'' and said they were most urgently required and should be returned by the next ship leaving Bombay. I have received no advice of the despatch of the cases from Bombay but as I heard the 4 ' Havildar '' was coming back at once I supposed the gear would be on board and my officers made arrangements accordingly. When, however, Lieutenant Grant was on board the S. S. ' Warturm ' looking for the ' Rebel's ' gear he came across some oars, poles and other survey equipment and on making enquiries he found thab the missing 63 cases and bundle were on board but they were not consigned to any one and if Lieutenant Grant had not discovered them the cases would have been dumped on the bank at Magill where they might have remained indefinitely. Had the authorities in India on receipt of your telegram advised me of the action taken, we could have obtained delivery the day after ' Warturm ' arrived, i.e., the 24th March. I have detailed Lieutenant Grant to visit every vessel in which we are advised there are goods for us but he cannot search every steamer on the chance of small parcels of goods having been shipped without advice being given to any one. Even when advices are received they are not reliable as we were informed that certain timber specified in detail had been shipped by the '' Risaldar 5 ' and when the ship arrived none of it was on board. I enclose a copy of Lieutenant Grant's report. (Sd.) GEORGE C. BUCHANAN, Colonel, Director-General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. No. 164-A.-16, Dated Basra, the 31st March 1916. D.G. of P. A. and B.C. I have to report that on the 30th instant I went with Mr. Renfrew (Master of the dredger &lt;£ Oswald ') to the R. I. M. dockyard by request to take delivery of two small motor engines ; S697(w)AD42 while taking them away Mr. Renfrew stumbled across some 19 angle iron seatings and about 23 pipe clamps which he identified as belonging to the dredger's pipe lines. On making enquiries the Storekeeper told me that he did not know what the fittings were, nor o w om they were consigned and that he intended putting them on the scrap heap nex ay 0 ® room for more of his stores and he would be glad if I would take them away as he wassa is e they were intended for this department. On the evening of the 31st Major Niven noticed that the pipe fittings had been taken away ; I asked the Storekeeper what had been done with them and he said he had no no'v\ e g e of their having been removed. Major Niven and I then searched the scrap heapoutsi e e dockyard and found that the missing parts had been dumped there. The same day I went on board S. S. ' Warturm ' to enquire about the launch ' Rebel's ' gear of which we had advice (see No. 766-Q., dated 20th March 1916). The ' Warturm ' arrived m Basra on the 23rd March and I went on board on the 27th but was told by the Chief Officer that the hold containing the ' Rebel's ' gear would not be opened for another 3 days. ^ On the 30th I again went to the' Warturm ' and found 5 cases of fittings for the ' Rebel and in addi tion what appeared to be cases of survey gear, sampan oars, rope, etc., as they were stamped with the mark used by Major Niven when sending such material from Rangoon. On asking the Chief Officer about them he informed me that he had 68 cases altogether sent by the R. I. M., Bombay, but did not know to whom they were consigned in Basra. Five of these cases contained the &lt;£ Rebel's ' gear and there is no doubt that the remaining 63 packages are those which were taken back to Bombay by the ' Havildar ' on the 29th February. No advice whatever was received by this office of their being returned to Basra and it was only by accident I happened to notice them. Further advice was received of there being 8 teak 12' X12' piles on board the Risaldar arriving in Basra about the 19th March (see No. 1439 F. P., dated 26th March 1916). On enquiry the Chief Officer told me he knew nothing about this timber and it was not on the ship's manifest. I was on board on the 29th March when the ship was nearly unloaded and there was no sign of timber and nobody on board knew anything about it. (Sd.) J. G.

I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with telegram No. 300-1., dated the 16th March 1916, from the Secretary to the Government of Burma, Public Works Department, relative to the despatch to Mesopotamia of the dredger ' Oswald and her accessories. 2. The Government of India in Marine Department telegram No. H.-10046, dated the 24th December 1915, asked that either the dredger ' Oswald ' or ' Campbell' might be made available for the dredging operations for which Sir George Buchanan was being deputed to Mesopotamia, together with dredging master, crew, and complete equipment of electric light, workshops, 800 feet of pipe line complete with pontoons and terminal pontoons, and requested that if the dredger could be made available preparations should be made for her sailing and for dismantling of pontoons, pipe line, and terminal pontoon for despatch by cargo steamer. An indication of the impoitance of the dredging operations was also given. In your telegram No. 662, da'edthe 25th December 1915, you intimated His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor's willingness to accede to the Government of India's request, and in telegram No. 522-1., dated the 31st December 1915, from the Secretary to the Government of Burma, Public Works Department, the Govern ment of India were informed that arrangements were being made for repairing the dredger for sea, dismantling pipe line and terminal pontoon, and that work was being put in hand for despatch when ready, probably in a month's time or so. In telegram No. 12, dated the 11th January 1916, from the Secretary to the Government of Burma, PublicWorks Department, the Government of India were informed that the dredger would be ready to sail on the 15th January, and that portions of the dredging equipment had been shipped in the'' Oolabaria ' sailing January 17th, and in Marine Department telegram No. H.-274 of the date follow ing the Government of Burma was informed that she should be despatched as -soon as ready. In telegram No. 53-1., dated the 12th January 1916, the Secretary to the Gov ernment of Burma, Public Works Department, repeated a telegram which he had sent to Sir George Buchanan intimating that the dredger was leaving Rangoon with her old pump-casing and pipes, and strongly advising that a new pump-casing and internal suction and discharge pipes should be fitted at Bombay as those then in use would not last very long. This telegram was repeated for necessary action to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who in reply represented that the work should have been commenced in Rangoon where drawings were available and accurate measurements could have been taken before the dredger's departure, adding that he had no information as to the material that would be required and that leaving the work to be carried out in Bombay entailed considerable delay in its completion. The Director's representation was communicated to the Govern ment of Burma, Public Works Department, in Marine Department telegram No. H.-394, dated the 17th January 1916,with the request that the Director, Royal Indian Marine, should be furnished with any available information likely to be of assistance to him in making preliminary arrangements for fitting the new pump- casing and internal suction and discharge pipes. In telegram No. 58, dated the 18th January, the Secretary to the Government of Burma, Public Works Department, intimated that the dredger and the ' Oola baria ' sailed for Bombay on the nth idem. 3. It has been brought to the notice of the Government of India that unneces sary delay has been incurred in getting the dredger with all her accessories to Basra ready for work. The Government of India are informed that, prior to despatch tbe pump-casing of dredger was being renewed in Rangoon under the superintend ence of the Public Works Department, but that the work was stopped; Siri + +na +&gt;10+ lip Via^ been informed tliat the Principal Port Officer, Geoigo uuchanan states that h stoDT)ed the work. 1 am to ask whether Rangoon, through some misapp wer ^ any special reason for stopping the t h-s it was found that considerable repairs to the dredger work.

You state that the stores belonging to the dredger were despatched to Rangoon in three different ships, without any information as to which were stowed in each ship, and that in the majority of cases the stores were not even P^ked Mt tied up with gunnies and had no labels on them. You add that the stores had to be collected in the Dockyard, carefully sorted out from a number of other stores received from the same vessel, and those belonging to the dredger properly packed and des- patched to Basra. 3. In reply I am to say that the Government of Burma are being addressed on the subject. 4 I am, however, to observe that it would appear from information furnished to the Government of India subsequent to the receipt of your letter that there were other circumstances, besides those mentioned by you, which contributecUowards tie delay in getting the dredger and her auxiliary vessels ready for work at Basra and45 I in the commencement of-survey operations, and in this connection I am to enclose* 'Paragraphs 5, 8, 12, 13, and 15 of Sir G- ^ om / memorandum by the Buchanan's memo.

In regard to paragraphs 8,12,13 and 15 of the Director General's memorandum of the 21st March, I am to ask that you will explain why the ' Oolabaria,' instead of •discharging the stores at Bombay, was not despatched direct to Basra, and also the reasons for the delay which occurred in despatching the stores, gear, and equipment irom Bombay, especially in respect of certain gear belonging to the launch ' Rebel' without which she was useless pending their arrival. I am also to invite your attention to Mr. Renfrew's letter of the 24th March and to request that you will furnish the Government of India with a full report on the points brought to notice in that letter; this report should include an explanation irom Captain Hordern in regard to his attitude towards Mr. Renfrew. 5. In conclusion I am to invite a reference to telegram No. 1111-46-Q., dated the 3rd March 1916, from the General Officer Commanding, Force ' D,' to your addresr, intimating that certain packages were not cleared from the Hired Transport ' Havildar ' before leaving Basra for Bombay, at the same time requesting that the packages referred to should be returned by the next ship leaving Bombay, as they were urgently required. These packages were, it appears, subsequently de spatched to JBasraby the r Warturm,' but no advice of their despatch was received by the General Officer Commanding, Force ' D,' until long after the arrival of the Tessel. This omission caused delay in making over the packages in question to the the Department concerned, and I am to request that you will explain why no inti mation of their despatch was sent to the General Officer Commanding, No. H-3785, dated Simla, the 11 th May 1916.

Extract from a report by the Director-General, Port Administration and River Conservancy, Indian Expeditionary Force 'D,' with relevant accom paniment are forwarded which tend to show that unnecessc.ry delay has been incurred in forwarding the gear and equipment of the survey party from Bombay and that while awaiting shipment at that port there was considerable lack of care in the handling and custody of the equipment. 3. I am to request that you will report fully on the reasons for this delay, at the same time explaining with whom the responsibility rests both for the delay and for the indifferent treatment accorded to the equipment, while awaiting shipment. S697(w)AD46 Extract from a Memorandum hy the Director-General of Port ^Administration and River Conservancy, Indian Expeditionary Force D. Mr. Niven left Rangoon overland on the IStli January and arrived at Bombay on the 24th January and found no arrangements had been made for transhipping the survey eqnpment from the ' Orna.' The result was that the subordinate staff left Bombay on the 25th January, arriving at Basra on the 31st January. Mr. Niven arrived on the # 5th February and the equipment on the 15th re xuary. As I had given Mr. Niven specihe orders to meet the staff and equipmen m Bombay and accompany them to Basra I asked him for a written explanation and received a reply (Appendix I) which I considered acquitted him of any blame; in the matter. Hs ^ $ &amp; * * * * O ffice of the D tbectok- G eneral of P out A dmikisteation ani&gt; R iver O oservancy. 53, Strand Road; Basra, the Mth February 1916. To—The Director-General of Port Administration and River Conservancy M emorandum. With reference to your No. 21-A.-16, dated the 9th instant, I think the follow ing explanation will make it clear that the piecemeal arrival of myself, the stan y and the survey equipment was brought about by causes which were not within my control. 1. On January 8th the Government of Burma telegraphed to the Govern ment of India, Marine Department, asking them, to arrange for the transhipment of the survey staff numbering 44 persons and equipment from Bombay to Basra and on the 14th January sent a further wire saying that the party and equipment had left on that date on the steamer &lt;e Orna ' and were expected to arrive in Bombay on the 23rd January. 2. On January 18th I left Rangoon for Bombay via Calcutta and arrived in Bombay on the 24th January. I was met at the station by the surveyors,, who informed me that they arrived in Bombay on the 22nd January but no one^ met them on the ' * Orna '' or made any arrangements for their housing and it was only after appealing to the Commissioner of Police that the party was^ provided with accommodation in one of the rest camps. The survey equipment meanwhile had, been discharged at Victoria Dock r and from a subsequent inspection I made it was obvious that no care or super vision had been exercised in the process. The equipment consists largely of carefully adjusted instruments^, and to avoid their being damaged or unneces sarily handled I had them stowed in Rangoon on tie top of the ' Orna's ' cargo. To instance the lack of care to which these cases were treated in Bombay I might mention that I found one of them being used as a loading platform for carts removing goods from the quay. The care bestowed on the equipment up to its arrival in Bombay was completely undone by the careless treatment it received there. I reported the matter to Commander Huddleston, who told me that the Agents of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company were entirely - responsible and that we should claim damages from them. It is clear, however^ that, had the Royal India Marine, Bombay, arranged for the tranship ment of the equipment according to the instructions, this would not have happened and I cannot see that the Shipping Agents are in any way responsible. 3. On arrival in Bombay I reported to the Director, Royal Indian Marine,, who informed me that the '' Orna ' 5 with the staff and equipment had not yet arrived, but had been signalled down the coast. Captain Lumsden only credited my report of the c 6 Orna's/' arrival on my informing him that I had actually seen the staff. 4. I then got in touch with the S. E. 0. and found that all arrangements had been made for myself and the staff to leave for Basra on the Transportt( Edavana 5 5 sailing the following day, i.e., Tuesday, 25tli January. I pointed out that I could not possibly leave without seeing the equipment off and at my request the Director, Royal Indian Marine, wired to the Quartermaster-General, Delhi, asking his approval to my remaining behind in Bombay for this purpose and sailing by the mail for Basra on the 29th January. This was agreed to and the staff sailed by the ' Edavana ' on Tuesday, 25th January. 5. The survey equipment, as I have pointed out, was discharged from the 4 4 Orna '' by the ship's staff on the 23rd January—the date stated by the Govern ment of Burma in their telegram—but the Marine not being aware of the steamer's arrival in Port took no action and thereby the chance of shipping the equipment with the staff on the ' Edavana ' was lost. Commander Huddleston informed me that there would not be another transport to Bombay for some considerable time, but I pressed the urgency of the matter upon him and he arranged in con sultation with Commander Douglas for the '' Havildar 5 ' to come into Port and take our equipment to Basra via Karachi.- This arrangement was made on the 27th January and I was told by Commander Douglas that the equipment must be alongside the ' Havildar' on the following day, otherwise it could not be accommodated. As regards the actual transfer of the equipment from the Victoria to the Alexandra Dock, I was informed that Commander Douglas would see to this, but on reference to that officer I found that he only dealt with stores delivered alongside the transport and he suggested I should write to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, and get the assistance of the Marine Store-keeper. This was done and I understand eventually the Commissioner's Conractor effected the removal of the equipment. I went to the dock and personally inspected the transfer of the equipment, but would point out that this was not work which I should have been called upon to do when I had so many other matters connected with tne dredge^ to discuss and arrange with the Chief Constructor of the Dockyard. 6. I can state with assurance that had I not remained behind to arrange for the transhipment of the equipment that even more serious delays than those we are now faced with would have occurred. Had prompt action been taken on the arrival of the 4 c Orna ' 9 on the 22nd, to tranship the equipment I consider it could have been placed on board the &lt;£ Edavana ' and brought to Basra along with the staff and myself. (Sd.) E. C. NIVEN, Assistant Director, River Conservancy. Letter No. 54424, dated the 17th May 1916. (Diary No. 54424.) From—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla, To—The General Officer Commanding, Force ' D,' Basra. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum No. 1142-12 -Q., dated 3rd April 1916, forwarding a letter No. I49-A-I6, dated the 28th March 1916, from the Director General, Port Administration and River Conservancy, showing the various causes which had prevented that officer from commencing dredging and other conservancy work in connection with the River Tigris and Hammar Lake. I 2. You explain that all necessary action has been taken in Mesopotamia to smooth away and remove, as far as may be possible, any causes for the delay in that country, and suggest that enquires may be instituted in regard to the delays which had apparently taken place in India, particularly at Bombay, in forwarding the plant and equipment for the dredger. [ 3. In reply I am to say that the necessary enquiries have been instituted in this country. 4. I am, however, to inform you that a copy of correspondence relating to the delays referred to has been communicated to the Government of India by the48 Director General, Port Administration and River Conservancy. Memorandum No. 169-A-16, dated 1st April 1916, from Sir George Buchanan which was not communicated with your memorandum No. 1142-12-Q., dated 3rd April 1916, is included in this correspondence. I am to point out the serious nature of the charges preferred against those responsible for the safe custody and delivery of the fittings of the dredger, and to ask that after a full enquiry those reponsible may be adequately dealt with. I am also to request that full enquiries may be made with a view to fixing the responsibility for the delay in the discharge of the equipment from the S. S. ' Havildar ' in February last, and for the lack of supervision and indifference displayed in unloading operations brought to notice in Major Niven's letter of the 2nd March 1916, and Captain Lakin's letter of the same date. 5: I am to point out that the explanation of the P. M. T. 0. forwarded with your No. 1111-65-Q., dated 14th April 1916, regarding the departure of S. S. &lt;£ Havildar ' before the equipment had been discharged is incomplete and unsatis factory. It is incomplete, in that it does now show clearly that the Master of the Ship actually furnished a signed certificate to the effect th^t the holds of the ' Havildar ' were clear of all cargo : the clearance certificate attached to Captain Huddleston's letter No. A -65, dated 4th May 1916, is neither dated, signed nor certified to be a true copy. A doubt, therefore, exists as to what actually took place.. Assuming that the certificate was actually furnished, no explanation is given by the master as to his reasons for submitting a certificate which was false, neither does he appear to have been called upon to do so. If no certificate was furnished, or, if the certificate was signed, and sailing orders issued before the holds had been cleared, an explanation is required as to why, and by whom, sailing orders were issued. 6. The explanation is unsatisfactory, in that an endeavour is made to justify the decision to over-carry cargo through ignorance on the part of those responsible of the fact that some- of the packages were urgently required. It is clear from Captain Lakin's Memorandum, dated 2nd March 1916, which formed an enclosure to letter No. 74 -A .-16, dated 3rd March 1916, from the D. G., P. A. and R. C. to Major-General Cowper, that no doubt as to the urgent necessity for clearing the sur veying equipment from the S. S. ' Havildar ' can have existed. The explanation is also unsatisfactory, in that it refers only to the last 24 hours during which the vessel was at Basra. No reason^ are given for the great delay in unloading which took placs during the period from 15th February to 29th February. I am to request that a full report may now be furnished. Serial No. 55, ■^ 0 - 114 -450-E., dated Bombay, the 17th May 1916. From—The Embarkation Commandant, Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, Simla. With reference to your letter No. H-3785, dated the 11th May 1916, I have the honour to make the following report. 1. Copy of Quartermaster-GeneraFs No. 924-1-W.S., dated the 10th January 1916, giving the strength of Mr. Niven's survey party and space requii ed for stores was sent to the Senior Marine Transport Officer, under this office No. 114-869-E., dated the 11th January 1916, as he allots space for baggage, stores, etc. 2. Copy of Quartermaster-General's No. 924-2-W.S., dated the 15th January 1916, giving the date Mr. Niven's party was despatched, and probable date of arrival, was forwarded to the Senior Marine Transport Officer under this office No. 114- 829-E., dated the 17th January 1916, with a request to be informed on what Transport the equipment would be loaded, so that the personnel could be accom modated in the same Transport. The Senior Marine Tansport Officer in his No. 4659, dated the 17th January 1916, informed that the equipment would be loaded in H. T. ^ Edavana ' and so the personnel were allotted accommodation on that Transport. 3. This equipment was despatched on the SS. ' Orna,' which is a private vessel and not a Transport, The equipment was discharged at Victoria Dock by tlie British India Steam Navigation Company,(g) 49 The actual date of the arri val of the ' Orna ' was not known in this office and was apparently not known by tlie Director, Royal Indian Marine. 4. This equipment was evidently Marine Stores, and as such was apparently consigned to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, who undertook the transhipment. For this reason I am unable to answer the question contained m paragrap o your letter quoted above. No. 4517, dated Bombay, the 10th June 1916. Serial No. 56. From—The Director of the Royal Indian Marine, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. H-3784: of 11th May 1916, with a memorandum from the Director General of Port Adminis tration and River Conservancy, regarding the alleged delay m g et ^ i:ri g tJ:ie dredger and her auxiliaries ready for work at Basra, etc., and the lack ot super vision in shipping the survey equipment ex ' Orna. In reply I have caused the fullest enquiries to be made into this matter from the officers concerned and submit for the information of the Government of India the following remarks :— Paraqmph With reference to paragraph 5 of Sir George Buchanan's report, and with regard to the survey equipment ex ' Orna,' so far as can be traced m this office a telegram was received from the Principal Port Officer, Rangoon, as follows, Rangoon 15th January :— Begins ' Orna ' sailed yesterday with 4 rowing boats 10 sampans and material for survey work Mesopotamia, also s.taf£ of 7 iLuropeans and 27 Natives. Ends. This telegram was at once repeated to Sir George Buchanan, vide my M.X.-143 of 16th January to care of Base Commandant, Basra. No rep y was reeceivcd from Sir George Buchanan nor can I trace any request from him that the ship should be . met by an officer of the Marine Department at all. I have ascertained from the Embarkation Commandant, Bombay, however, that he received the following telegram from the Quartermaster General, JNo. S24-1-W .S., dated 10th January Begins. Government of Burma wires requesting arrangements be made for transhipment of Niveris survey party and equipment to Mesopo tamia. He proposes sailing by the ' Orna ' expected to sail trom Rangoon 14th, but the actual date of departure will be wired later. Party consists of 44, require accommodation as follows ; one 1st, eleven 2nd, 32 deck. Equipment accompanying requires 4,500 cubic feet space. Please arrange onward passage to Basra, first opportunity after arrival of party in Bombay. Ends. It will be observed that no one was specially asked to meet the party nor would it be anything but extraordinary to expect any one to do so. The telegram was not repeated to this office and the Embarkation Command ant arranged entirely the party's departure in the ' Edavana ^ d M as ^ ^ space to be reserved for the staff in that vessel and this was done, w^Mr. Isiven s report, paragraph 4. It is quite evident from Mr. Nwens report per fectly well aware of the proper procedure even if his staff had had no definite orders which I certainly consider should have been issued to them. On their arnjal they should have at once got in touch with the Embarkation Supply Officer which appa rently Mr, Niven did, or at any rate reported themselves to some one, at the Docks which, so far as I can ascertain, they did not do. I would draw the particular atten tion of Government to Sir George Buchanan's own statement that he had ordered Mr Niven meet the party at Bombay. This Mr. Niven failed to do by two days and I consider it extraordinary that Sir George Buchanan should then endeavour to blame the Marine Department at Bombay for the miscamageof his ^orders —by stating that the party u were to have been met by an officer of the Marine S607(w)AD50 Department and transliipped to Basra.' I venture to think that the Government of India will agree that there were no grounds for this astounding assertion. With regard to the lack of care which Mr. Niven states was bestowed on the survey equipment and the Government of India query as to who was responsible for the lack of supervision,—I would point out that Sir George Buchanan s survey party travelled with their own equipment—survey instruments being of a very delicate nature, I consider it was only natural to suppose that the party who knew what was on board (and they were the only people who did know, for no list or bill of lading was sent to this office until after Mr. Niven's arrival) would take care to see that their own equipment was safely landed. If an officer in charge of marine survey party was travelling with valuable marine survey instruments, as they do twice a year to and from the hill station and also by sea, had treated valuable Government property in the manner that these instruments appear to have been treated, I should certainly have reprimanded him for his carelessness and required an explanation in writing for his neglect of duty, and the very fact that as stated by Mr. Niven the equipment consisted ^ largely of carefully adjusted instruments which he himself had had stowed on top of the ' Orna's ' cargo at Rangoon, in my opinion shows the imperative necessity of issuing orders to his own staff to look after it at this end, and it is difficult to understand that if Mr. Niven considered it necessary to take such care in Rangoon, and to personally supervise the loading, why he should have failed to issue orders for equal care to be exercised by his statt in discharging these delicate instruments at Bombay, which after all were in their own charge. So far as I can trace no request was made to this department to supervise the landing of the equipment, no list of the articles to be landed was sent to this office and it was not until Mr. Niven himself {after the equipment had been landed) asked for assistance that any one in this office was made aware of what the equipment con sisted. The officer who would be in the ordinary course responsible for taking over the charge of the equipment and reshipping it, would be the Marine Store-keeper, but he was not aware tlat any equipment was to be shipped, until Mr. Niven asked for his assistance, he then at once took the usual measures to have the equipment shipped by the Port Trust, who invariably carry out this work for the Marine Department as their contractors, but in view of the above facts, I am of opinion that the survey party themselves were entirely responsible for the mishandling, of the equipment and it is difficult to understand why Sir George Buchanan should endeavour to shift the responsibility on the Marine Department when they had never been even asked to assist. With regard to Mr. Niven's statement that he reported the matter to Com mander Huddleston,—Commander Huddleston had nothing whatever to do with the transhipment of these stores or any other but military stores, his duties being entirely concerned with military transport and on demand and under my orders arranging the actual vessels that stores are shipped in, but in this case he was not even consulted as they were not military stores in the sense of transport work- Mr. Niven came to Commander Huddleston's office whilst he was waiting to see the Deputy Director, and asked who was responsible for the safe landing of stores ship ped in a merchant vessel. Commander Huddleston's reply that the Company was responsible was a perfectly correct one. The Company are responsible until the stores are landed and if any damage is done, it must be pointed out at the time by the party taking over the stores, when the Company would have to pay for careless ness cf stowage, etc., etc., but as I have endeavoured to show it appears that the whole party were in Bombay for two days before any one thought it necessary to supervise the landing of their own equipment. With regard to paragraph 6 of Mr. Niven's report, I can only state that if he had issued the obvious orders to his staff to supervise themselves the transfer of their own most delicate instruments, and if he had not been two days late in arrival that not only would there have been no delay, but that he and his staft would have been transhipped in the ' Edavana ' as arranged by the Embarkation authorities. I trust that the above remarks will demonstrate to the Government of India that no blame attaches to this Department for the lack of care bestowed by Six George Euehanan's paiticularly carefully selected officers on their own equipment.1 now come to the accusations with regard to the delay in despatch of the (dredging plant ex Oolobaria, I have already informed the Government of India that the primary cause of delay was the disgraceful manner in which these stores wer ® shipped at Rangoon, and the difficulties attendant on collecting the stores for shipment at this end, and I would again reiterate that the stores arrived in three different vessels, and I would ask Government to carefully note that the stores ez ' Oolobaria ' were shipped at Rangoon as one lot without tally and were also discharged m Bombay m the same manner, and that the British India Company had not even anything on record to show the number of packages actually shipped, mde copy of British India's letter to the Staff Officer of his Dockyard on page 6 of the Government of India's enclosures. I do not think it is necessary for me to describe to Government the natural confusion that followed—owing to the lack of foresight on the part of those responsible for the shipment at Rangoon the only wonder is that it was eventually found possible to collect the stores at all at Bombay and that half of them were not lost. I would draw the attention of Government to the fact that upwards of between 25,000 and 30,000 tons of military stores have been despatched monthly to Basra from Bombay alone during the^ past six months, and that this is the very first case m which there has been the slightest hitch of any sort or description as can be proved by a reference to the different departments concerned and in fact the ships have always been ready to load as soon as or before the stores arrived. In this con nection I do not include marine stores and stores for launches which have had to be shut out for lack of space and yet these were not sufficient at any one particu lar time to charter a vessel specially. The Government of India enquire and Sir George Buchanan definitely states that it is ' not apparent why the ' Oolobaria ' should not have proceeded direct to Basra,' more especially as no transhipment was affected on the 1st February. The ' Oolobaria ' was not then a Government transport, and I would point out that in veiw of the most pressing telegrams from Government that it was impera tive that no tonnage should be impressed which could possibbly be avoided and that no wastage should occur, it is hardly conceivable that I should have been expected then, or at any other time, to take up a vessel capable of carrying 12,500 cubic tons to lift 640 cubic tons—the idea being so ridiculous and showing such a. lack of knowledge of shipping requirements as to lead me to suppose that Sir George Buchanan cannot have seriously considered what his suggestion meant,— this then gives the reason why the ' Oolobaria ' was not impressed, but I would further point out that the 'Oolobaria' was full of timber brought round on private account and that this all had to be discharged before the dredger gear could possibly have been restored in the same ship and it was necessary to dis charge the dredger gear first or the ship would have been too heavy with the wood discharged and the dredger gear left on board. When the dredger gear was eventually collected every endeavour was made to ship it as soon as possible, but at the same time it must be remembered that urgent demands were pouring in from '* D ' Force for military stores which were required to he shipped at once, and I was faced with the question as to which to give preference (1) military and marine stores urgently required for the fighting forces and the launches and tugs that were to be utilised in getting the forces to the front, (2) stores for a dredger and auxiliaries which had not at that time even arrived in Mesopotaimia. It is quite true that I had stated that the stores ex ' Oolobaria ' would be transhipped on the 1st February, but it must be remembered that at that time I supposed the stores would be carefully shipped, and addressed, and that they would arrive in time to be transpipped on the date. The ' Oolobaria ' did not arrive till 'the 3lst January, and as I have before stated by the time the stores were collected shipping was not at once available. Had I been informed that these stores were to take precedence of any other military stores no doubt a certain portion of them could have been shipped earlier, but I was not informed that any particular part was more important than the other, and it was not until the 27th February that the ' Onda' arrived with the last shipment of gear for the dredger-With regard to tie ' Rebel's ' gear every iauneh that has been sen Force has had to have the gear sent up after it. The R ^ e J d , f M h at Basra, vide Sir George Buchanan'sreport parargaph 8, UI1 5 aunchea and I was not aware that this launch should have preference to otHe launches which were required for the fighting forces, and the only reason that this gear was not shipped before was the lack of space in the ships carrying ^ores Force. Owing to the urgent demands f 01 store \ to b \ shl P p ® d p tV f wX of which could be shut out and it would of course have been mer y tonnage to have taken up aressel specially for the purpose. In parargaph 12 of Sir George Buchanan's report he states Master was fully aware of the necessity for all the P 1 ? 68 to ^ 1V , , t f to the dredger and it seems a pity that Sir George Buchanan did not tale ste^s ^ intimate to the Government of India the necessity for this instead , £ . a subordinate, but in any case unless I had received direct orders for this P lan ^ 1 given a preference to all military stores I consider it is only na ura Jiave given preference to^the military stores. With reference to paragraph 5.—Telegram No. 1111-46-Q. was rec ® lv .® d ^ Bombay on the 4th March, on the same date action was taken on it and it was arranged that the over-carried stores of the ' Havildar should, as soon as they could be landed, be re-shipped in the next ship returning to Basra as requested. The ' Havildar ' arrived at Bombay on March 7th, the Master was immediately called on for a report (copy of his reply attached) as to why he a over carr ^ the packages. The packages were under certain amount of stores, as vail be seen from the report of the Master, and were not even until the ISthJVU , they were all transhipped into the ' Warturm,' which kos the vessel to leave after the ' Havildar's ' arrival apd which vessel sailed on the 17th March and arrived at Basra on the 22nd March, i I am at a loss to understand the General Officer Commanding's statement that he was not informed until long offer the arrival of the Warturm o e despatch of these stores from Bombay. On the 15th March before the ar urm sailed and as soon as it was known the stores could ^e shipped, the following tele gram was despatched to the Principal Marine Transport Ofncer, U orce . Begins.' No, M. P. 330, dated 15th March. Master of ' Hayildar ' report regarding non-landing of stores is being forwarded to 7°^- Stores have been transhipped to ' Warturm ' leaving loth or inn. March' Ends, It will thus be seen that' D ' Force were informed in the usual manner, that the stores had been shipped and by what vessel, and it is presumed that the Principal Marine Transport Officer, (e I) ' Force, disseminated this information to e departments concerned in the ordinary course, and it was, I submit, fortms onice to reduplicate the telegram by wiring to General Officer Commanding, D 0 p Ce f direct on such a matter, nor has it ever been the practice to do so and this is the lirst complaint on the subject T Further on 17th March the &lt;f Warturm's ' departure was again reported to ' D ' Force, and the date of her arrival given. Again on the same day a telegram was sent to say the ' Rebel's ' gear was also on board ' Warturm.' I venture to think that Government will admit that every care was taken that this information was sent to ' D ' Force. In conclusion I must also again bring to your notice that the Store Depart ment who are principally concerned in this case have been dealing with stores oi all sorts and descriptions for the period since the outbreak of war, working as a rule 12 hours a day at receiving, issuing, packing, carting, and arranging freight, and are kept so busy that a case or package coming improperly addressed or with no address is automatically put on one side rather than delay the whole day s work with instituting and carrying out these enquiries. From the tone of the letter of Sir George Buchanan and his subordinates I am forced to the'conclusion that they assume the Marine Department generally have nothing else to do except look after an equipments which is a mere item in the daily53 dealings with a very large amount of stores ; and if properly looked after by the survey party would have passed through almost unnoticed. The calm manner in which the officer in charge and the party repudiate all responsibilities for care and supervision in spite of the fact that they have been specially sent in the same ship for the express purpose is quite inexplicable to me. A parallel case would be if an officer with some valuable Government property arrives at a terminus, proceeds to his hotel without taking steps to see his luggage sent after him, and then immediately sets down and writes to the Railway Company for an explanation why his luggage has not been sent immediately after him. That is how the transaction appears to people on the spot and thoroughly experienced in dealing with transhipment of stores. I would also bring to your notice that although Sir George Buchanan expresses himself perfectly satisfied with Mr. Niven's explanations,—that gentleman has according to extracts sent to me given none at all, he certainly did not carry out Sir George Buchanan's instructions to meet the ' Orna ' at Bombay, and although he must have known when he left Rangoon the date of his arrival in Bombay he took no steps to acquaint any one that he would not be on the spot to meet the ship. Having arrived, Mr. Niven makes a grievance of the fact that the Marine Department had not done the work that he was presumably expressly ordered to do • here I must again bring to } our notice that this Department is and has been ex ceedingly busy in supplying and shipping stores to all war areas, and working at 12 hours a day every day while Sir George Buchanan's party had nothing whatever to do except to look after themselves and their stores. The more I consider the case the more astonished I am at the extraordinary attitude taken up by Sir George Buchanan, who appears to have no rhyme or reason for the greater part of his attacks on the Marine and every reason for being dissatisfied with his own subordinates. I enclose the explanation tendered of Captain B. J. C. Hordem, R.I.M., which I do not consider altogether satisfactory. But here again is an officer who is harassed all day long by interviews while he is busily occupied, especially at that time with the question of towage and all its contingent anxieties and worries, m despatch of stores and by no means m good health. His reference to the other two dredgers was no doubt somewhat out of place, but there was the fact staring him in the face how little had been done with them and also that after day and night work forthree months en the pipes and pontoons in this dockyard during which time both he and I had to leave our houses perio dically in order to get a night's rest. They had only been used for bridging the Tigris. I have in my letter No. 2468 of 5th April 1916 commented on the procedure followed with regard to the repairs of the dredger which was certainly calculated to unduly delay her commencing operations. I much regret any delay that occurs in the provision of stores and other necessities for the Mesopotamia campaign and can honestly say that every endea vour f made by all sections here to avoid such ; but 1 must m fairness to my sub ordinates ask that all assistance possible he given by parties concerned. The store department has been of necessity reorganized several times to meet the ever growing demands, but it is not possible to avoid congestion m the precincts, of the dochylrd and arsenal, which have not facilities necessary for dealing with the abnormal inraease that has taken place, and I can assure the Goyernment of India that overcoming difficulties in the way the storc-keepe. and his assistants have done must be considered exceedingly creditable to them. Th P instalment of Mr. Constable as Store Officer has already produced a very matted chTnge^or the better, and I trust that very few shortcomings will be notice- aWe in ftie future. His status as an officer and his abihty m organisation having very noticeable effect already. m 3 869.7(w) AD J54 Enclosure. Dated Bombay, tlie 15th March 1916.

I beg to state as follows — In my interview with the Director of Sea Transports, Basra, on February 27th and basing the calculation on all cargo finishing on the 28th night the sailing date was settled to February 29th at 8 a.m. On the 28th February the Indian Military Pay Staff embarked some 250 men and 9 British officers with 20 tons of kit. The position to me at 9 a.m . on February 29th was—Some stores still to dis charge from No. 2 hatch only. Pilot on board and with my orders to sail. Pas sengers on board. Weather squally with moderate to continuous heavy rain. My coolies practically worked to a standstill, having been working cargo all night. For the weather to continue and which appearances were in favour of, I con sider I should be no further advanced by the next day. Allowing myself just sufficient time to reach Fao that evening, some driving force was used with coolies to discharge cargo in the rain until 1 p.m ., and then I proceeded. The remaining steel piles were part of a consignment of 160, heavy and cum bersome and most awkward to discharge especially into mahailas. The remain - ing scantling was part of a large consignment and just too heavy to be easily discharged and handled by the boatmen. Other packages were jammed under the scantling. The river and shore traffic on this particular morning was quiet and still. My endeavour was to consider everything such as, passengers with reference to delay, importance or no importance of cargo yet to be discharged, state of weather and ability of coolies and if there was any latitude for me to decide against my sailing orders, especially under those circumstances. Apparently some of the packages were urgently required and which causes me to regret my decision to overcarry some and to that decision is solely due my error of judgment. Trusting my explanation is satisfactory and complete. A siatic S team N avigation C ompany, L td., H. T.' e H avildar 5 Bombay, 13th March 1916.

Dated Bombay, the June 1916. From— Captain E. J. C. Hordern, To—The Director of the Royal Indian Marine, Bombay. In accordance with your orders I have the honour to make the following report on the Government of India's letter No, 111-3784, dated the 11th May 1916, with an enclosure, from Mr. Eenfrew to Sir George Buchanan. Reference Government of India's letter paragraph 4 and Mr. Niven's state ment paragraph 7. At this length of time it is very difficult to remember my exact words to Mr. Niven, but in the course of conversation regarding the acceleration of the despatch of the dredger to Mesopotamia, I have no doubt that I did mention to Mr. Niven, that the idea was mooted, to send the dredger direct to Mesopotamia but only as an idea to accelerate her arrival—and there had been a discussion on the subject because as the dreclger had been working with a cracked pump in Burma, it was thought, she might therefore continue to do the same in Mesopotamia until tlie new pump could be made arfli sent up from Bombay, but after the question this plan was abandoned as being impracticable. I am certain I never mentioned that the dredger would go direct to Mesopotamia as stated by Mr. Niven, but only that she might. With reference to Mr. Renfrew's letter I have the following remarks to make.— I did not tell Mr. Renfrew that Sir George Buchanan should have made all arrangements for the pay of the dredger staff, but I may have said that I presumed Sir George Buchanan had made ail arrangements because I understood he had done so, and my reason for thinking this was the copy of a telegram, No. H.-188 j dated 8th January 1916 from Marine, Simla, to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, which stated that 44 all details in regard to Buchanan's personal survey are being arranged for by him here direct with Burma Government ' and I read this to mean that these details included his staff and also their pay, and I did not know anything about his staff or their pay. but I gave orders to the Chief Account ant to advance Mr. Renfrew any amount that he required and to forward the bills to Sir George Buchanan and this was done. It is difficult therefore to understand what Mr. Renfrew means by his statement. I have no recollection whatever of telling Mr. Renfrew that I considered the changing of dredgers a waste of money or of any such statement, though I may m the course of conversation, (with an expert such as Mr. Renfrew is supposed to be) have said that it was a pity that the dredgers Government had already spent so much money on were not considered fit for the work, and if I did so, it was no with any idea of getting any explanation from him but merely to inform him that other dredgers had been pronounced unsuitable. I regret that I discussed tne matter at all with him but I thought it was a matter of interest to him. With regard to paragraph 2 and Mr. Renfrew's statement regarding the cases he states that he found lying about the dockyard, his statements ^may be perfectly correct, but I would point out that there were absolutely no direc tions or lables on the cases and it was this very difficulty that made it so hard to collect the stores for onward shipment. I can see no reason whatever wliy Mr. Renfrew should not have visited me whenever he desired and m any caseI v 56 I went round tlie dockyard every morning to enquire daily the progress on tlie dredger, and with regard to the stores, and I was perfectly aware that the floaters were inside the breakwater (not in the dock) as this was the best place for them until we could obtain shipping for them. I was never asked to send any telegram to Sir George Buchanan nor did I ever dream of sending my compliments to Mr. Renfrew but Mr. Knight did show me a piece of paper with a draft telegram from Mr. Renfrew to Sir George Buchanan and I replied to Mr. Knight that every endeavour was being made to get the floaters up but I certainly did not reply to Mr. Renfrew. I trust that this explanation will satisfy the Government of India that there was no misunderstanding so far as I know between myself and Mr, Renfrew and that I made every endeavour to assist him. Serial No. 57. Memo. No. I656-a-Q. T dated 8tli July 1916. (Received 21st July 1916.) From—The General Officer Commanding, Force 'D,' To—The Chief of the General Staff. M emorandum. In reply to your No. 54424, dated 16th-17th May, I beg to submit separate reports with regard to :— {a) Memorandum No. 169-A-16, dated l^t April 1916, from the Director General of Port Administration and River Conservancy relative to dredger and component parts. (h) A further report regarding the over carriage by S.S. ' Havildar ' of certain equipraent consigned to the Director-General of Port Ad ministration and River Conservancy, and to observe as follows :— Dredger and component parts. 2. By a clerical oversight, which is regretted, Memorandum No. 169-A-16, dated 1st April from Colonel Sir George Buchanan was not included with the other documents forwarded under my No. 1142-12-Q., of 3rd April 1916. Wy- No. 48737.) I now forward No. A. -1852, dated 28th June from the Principal Marine Trans port Ofiicer, Force ' D,' forwarding a full explanation as to the causes which led to the dredger plant, etc., finding its way to the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard and the subsequent circumstances which occurred, In the above connection, I would invite attention to the following facts. If stores, in this particular instance dredger plant, are not marked with some dis tinguishing mark or address, it is not possible to ensure that they reach the consignee, As the plant in question was not marked, it is hardly to be won dered that it went astray. The reason that it was sent to the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard was due to the fact, as stated by the Principal Transport Marine Officer, that the Dockyard was then receiving consignments of scrap iron, etc. etc. If anyone is to be held to blame, I consider it is whoever was responsible for sending the plant, etc,, from Burma or Bombay, as the case may be, unmarked. In regard to the subsequent removal of the above plant to the Dockyard scrap heap after previous recognition by Lieutenant Grant and Mr. Renfrew, this action, I consider, was highly reprehensible. But, as it will be observed from the Principal Marine Transport Officer's letter under reference, it was due, to the carelessness of a man who' was not fitted to be a Marine Storekeeper, and who, apparently, should not have been sent here in that capacity and whose relief has already been asked for. The man, however, was immediately the occurrence was known, severely reprimanded for his stupidity, and as soon as the Director, Royal Indian Marine, can find a suitable man to replace him he is to be returned to India.57 I would invite attention to paragraphs (1), (2) and (3), Principal Marine Transport Officer's letter under reference. Overcarriage of cargo hy the S.S, ' Havildar,' 3. I now forward a further, and I trust a clear and explicit, report on this case&gt; from which it will be observed — (a) That there was never any question of the Master of the ' Havildar ' having signed a false clearance certificate. The misunderstanding on this point appears to be due to the fact that the specimen form of clearance certificate forwarded with my No. 1111-65-Q., dated 14th April 1916 {Dy,No. 52065) was a copy of an actual clearance certificate which had been rendered by the Master of the ' Havildar ' in connection with a previous voyage. In order, however, to make this point quite clear, the clearance certificate, in original, for the particular voyage under reference is now forwarded, from which it will be noticed that the Master made the necessary entries to show that No. 2 Hold was not clear when he left port. (h) It will also be noticed that the Master of the ' Havildar ' received his sailing orders dependent on his ship being cleared by the evening of the 28th February. I think, therefore, he should have un doubtedly referred the matter on the morning of the 29th February before taking upon himself the responsibility of sailing with any portion of his cargo undischarged. At the same time, he gives, in his letter of the 15th March 1916 forwarded under my No. 1111-65-Q. (By. No. 52065) of 14th April 1916, a number of reasons which of themselves were good and valid ones from his point of view, and he expresses regret for what at the utmost could only amount to an error of judgment. In the above connection I wish to invite attention to a fact which, appar ently, does not seem to be recognised. It is customary on occasion and by no means exceptional for a ship in a commercial port to deliberately overcarry cargo. It is sometimes greater economy for a firm of ship owners to pay compen sation on cargo overcarried than to detain a ship, whose detention may represent hundreds of pounds a day, for the extra period involved in extracting the cargo in question. It was the knowledge of these facts and the situation in which the Master of the ' Havildar ' found himself on the morning of the 29th February 1916 which, presumably, induced him to act as he did. (c) In regard to the opinions expressed by Major Niven and Captain Lakin, relating to the lack of supervision and difference displayed in the unloading of the ' Havildar,' I do not consider they were qualified to give an expert opinion on these points. I think it quite possible that their remarks may have been somewhat highly coloured, due to very natural irritation on their part at their inability to obtain the stores they required which were, apparently, at the bottom of the ship's hold, and consequently unobtainable until she had discharged practically the whole of her cargo. In any case, the daily record of the discharge of cargo, averaging 300 tons per diem, from the S.S. ' Havildar ' in this particular instance, clearly shows that there could not have been undue delay in the discharge of her cargo as a ship in the stream. (d) I now come to what, in my opinion, is the principal cause which led to the ' Havildar ' sailing on the 29th February with a portion of her cargo undischarged. It will be observed that Major Niven in his letter appendix II, dated 2nd March 1916, forwarded with my No. 1142-12-Q., dated 3rd April 1916 (By. No. 48737) states ' after waiting several days for the discharge of the equipment and having from personal observation come to the conclusion that there was no serious effort being made to discharge the steamer, I reported the matter to the D. A. and Q. M. O.' This statement is correct, as far as the last line is concerned. Major Niven did interview my D. A. and Q. M. G., but was told by Major-General Cowper to S697{w)ADrt go at once to the Principal Marine Transport^ 0fficeran ^ ma lff nevCT to that officer in regard to the matter. This, apparen y, i , did. Further, from the papers under'reference it is equally clear that such p ^ sentations as were made relating to the Surveying P j an . t ' 0 ? t he s hin by Colonel Sir George Buchanan's Staff were made to officers of the ship, (6) O C., Mahelas, (c) M. L. 0. None of these individuals were the proper pe to apply to.- Had, therefore. Colonel Sir George Buchanan, or , h j s , 1 su ^ rd ^f 1 applied eitlier officially or verbally, whicli they undoub e 7 ' . , Principal Marine Transport Officer, who was the responsiWe officer at that period for all questions and details connected with the unloading o p _ -t' there seems little doubt the stores in question would never have ee n • t It is apparent that they confined their representations o v ^ r ^ , assist-- port officers who, by the nature of their duties, could not afford them the ance th3y required. 4. With reference to the second paragraph of my No. fll42-12-Q., dated 3rd April 1916 (Dy. No. 84737) in which I informed you, m general terms, that I had taken all necessary action to' smooth away and remove, as far as possm , any causes of delay in this country, I now heg to submit for copies of various action taken by my staff to assist bir George uci it was known that his Survey equipment had been over-earned in the Havildar. (а) Telegram No. 111I-46-Q, of 3rd March the Chief of the General Staff and Director, Royal Indian M^me, reporting numbers of packages and cases not cleared from Havildar and requesting their immediate return. (б) Telegram No. llU4 ,9-Q-of 6th March {Dy. Ncj. 42218) to Director. Royal Indian Marine, and the Chief of the aeneral Staff giving further particulars re description of packages. (c) Memorandum No. 1428-1-Q., dated 5th March 1916 to 0. C. Survey Section, Deputy Director Works and Principal Marine transport Officer requesting above Departments to make necessary issues of articles (corresponding to those over-carried in the ' Havildar ) and to assist the Director General of Port Administration and Kiver Conservancy in every possible way. id) Memorandum No. 1111-5-Q of 9th March 1916 to Superintendent, Royal Indian Marine Dockyard directing him to supply oars (on- ginal ones over-carried in the ' Havildar ') for the use of the Direc tor General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. The result of (c) and (d) above was that efficient substitutes were tempo rarily supplied to Sir George Buchanan—thus enabling that officer to prosecute his river surveys pending the return of the equipment which had been over-carried on the Havildar.'^ (e) With reference to Major Niven's letter of the 21st March 1916, forward ed under my No. 114-2-Q. of 23rd April 1916 (Ty*No. 48737} relative to the condition in which the launch ' Rebel ' arrived at Basrah : orders were at once issued to the Principal Marine Transport Officer that work on the ' Rebel' was to be given preference over all other work and that everything was to be done to equip her as- speedily as possible. It was, however, impossible for the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard to replace many of the original fittings which had been retained in India, as the materials required for the same were not procurable in Mesopotamia. I have thought it necessary to cite the above cases in detail in order to show that in these particular instances, as well as in others, every possible assistance has invariably been afforded to Sir George Buchanan to help him to surmount any difficulties which may have arisen, in this country. 5, I suggest that it is hardly worth while to pursue this subject any further. My staff generally, and particularly the R. I. M. Officials who are much under staffed, is always overworked and is now handicapped by a large increase of sickness and invaliding. I hope the matter may now be dropped. ♦59 Telegfam No 1111-46-Q., dated the 3rd March 1916. from—The Assistant Quartermaster-General, Headquarters, To— The Chief of the General Staff.

MacMunn , Inspector-General of Communications, To—The Deputy Assistant and Quartermaster-General, General Headquarters. I forward herewith two letters from P. M. T. 0. (o) No. A.-1852 of 28th June, dealing with the question of the component parts of the D. G. P. A. &amp; R. C., dredger, and (b) No. A.-1851 of 30th June, dealing with the more serious question of the over- carrying of certain important stores, belonging to the same Directorate, on the storeship ' Havildar.' 2. These events happened before my arrival in Mesopotamia, but as they are matters in which organisation on the L. of C. is much concerned, I have not only carried out enquiries from time to time at your request, but have also enquired into the general system of unlading of steamers, both generally and specially in reference to the cases under enquiry. 3. I concur generally in what the P. M. T. 0. now states, which I believe to be an accurate statement of affairs. In the case of the dredger there is no doubt that the parts themselves were in some cases misconsigned, and that in the others a genuine and not unnatural mistake was made by the R. I. M, Dockyard. In the case of the ' Havildar ' it is now clear from the letter from the Master of the ' Havil dar ' that he put to sea knowing that one of his holds was not cleared, but pleads that he thought it was the best action to take. There can be no question that he should not have done so without reference, and this alone would amply account for the circumstance. From his clearing certificate no one in the Port would have expected him to sail without specific instructions to do so, in view of No. 2 Hold still containing cargo. 4. As a result of my investigation of facts generally, I find at the time the Embarkation Staff and the supervising personnel of the R.I.M. were both short- handed and very hard worked. The weather was bad and the Shatt-al-Arab difficult for lighterage and small craft. I am surprised in the conditions prevail ing that so few serious mistakes have taken place. It is unfortunate that the mistake on this occasion should have extended to very important stores. It must be understood moreover that in this apology for a port there are no wharves ; most of the bank is highly irrigated palm gardens, or swamps, tem porary wharves exist inadequate for the suddenly increased force, lighterage was and is deficient, shipping excessive. This strained all system to breaking point, and what happened is well within the margin of occasional error, which cannot be avoided. Those who have not seen such a situation will find it hard to realise the difficulties of carrying on operations, increasing in size, in a port totally un prepared for traffic on the scale which has arisen, and deficient in all machinery and facilities of a real port, 5. An almost identical incident happened in the Base of the Dardanelles Army at Lemnos, where a very large contractor with 2,000 workmen had arrived from Egypt to make a deep sea pier, and the whole of his tools were sent, back again, and it was regarded as a regretable occurrence in an overworked Base.

Dredger and Component Parts. The chief cause of a portion of the Dredger plant going astray was the failure of IJie sender to properly mark each part. If it was, impossible to paint D, G. ?,61 A &amp; E. C. on each piece, there would have been no difficulty in putting a paint mark of some fixed colour on each one ; this would have enabted correct delivery to be made and any small pieces should have been packed m cases marked D. f. A. B. C. In this case there was no mark of any description on the pieces referred to. Nobody except an expert could identify unmarked ' angle iron,' ' s ® at l?g s ' md ' -Dine clamps ' as being special gear for a dredger. As the B. I. M. Uock- vard had been receiving considerable quantities of scrap iron for casting purposes Swould explain how'the pieces of iron were delivered to the Doekyard Itis verv regrettable that after the gear was identified by Lieutenant Grant and Mr. Renfrew, it should have been put on the scrap heap, and for this my Storekeeper is entirelv to blame. He is a man who has had no experience of Marme Stores, and was^ent from India as the best man available. I have already represented to the Director B.I.M. that he is not satisfactory and that he should be relieved fey a man who has had experience of Marine Stores. From the above it will be seen that no one in the E I. M. Dockyard could be held responsible for inability to recognise the Dredger fittings. k -r^a fkp ^tnrpkeeDer he was severely reprimanded at the time for nis 1 AS Te ^ fllkmhia the above fittings, after identification, to be removed to the^crap^eap. Further, owing to the above circumstances and for other reasons, his speedy discharge has been asked for. ^ Marine Transport Officer, Base, reports as following on some instances of stores for D. G.

I consider this a creditable performance for overside dis charge of mixed cargo. 2. ' Lack of supervision and indifference displayed.' At the time the ' Havildar ' was discharging there were 10 ships altogether discharging, and only one R. I. M. Officer available to superintend the working; due to the smallness of the Staff and the number of other duties which had suddenly arisen on the rapid augmentation of Force D.' The rapid discharge of the ' Havildar ' is sufficient refutation of the statements made by Major Niven and Captain Lakin. 3. ' Points out that P. M. T. O.'s answer is incomplete, and unsatisfactory. The Master of the ship furnished a certificate relating to this particular voyage to the effect that the holds of the vessel were clear except Ko. 2 which contained balance of A. C. K. E. and Survey Party Stores, mostly wood. Extract from P. M. T. O.'s letter No. A.-65, dated the 4th April 1916 :— ' The precautions taken by this Department to prevent it are shown in the attached forms which are required to be filled in by the Master of every Transport before sailing.' The clearance certificate forwarded under this office No. A.-65, of 4th April 1916 was sent as a specimen and not as the certificte actually rendered by the Master of the ' Havildar ' for the particular voyage on which the shores in question were over carried. I now forward the actual certificate (D) in origincl from which it will be seen that the Master certified that the holds of the ' Havildar ' were clear of all cargo except No. 2, and he further specifies, in general terms the nature of the stores remaining in No. 2 Hold. i would beg to point out Captain Huddlteston did not say in his letter A.-65 ? dated the 4th April 1916 that the Master of the ' Havildar' had furnished a clear hold certificate. The above explains why the Master was not called on to furnish reasons, etc. Sailing orders are issued by the D. S. T. who has nothing to do with cargo» He is informed when a vessel will be clear and issues orders in advance, other wise a tide might be lost. In this case it was arranged that the cargo would be finished by the night of the 28th February and Sailing Orders were issued for 29th February. On that assumption Military details comprising 9 British officers and 250 Indian together with 20 tons of baggage were embarked on the evening of the 28th February. It was only on 29th, when it was seen by the Master that he could not get all his cargo out that he decided to sail with the small amount left in the hold. 4. In going over the file of the case I find that the Staff of the D. G. P. A. and R. C. never addressed this department as to the urgent necessity of getting these packages, etc., from the ' Havildar.' I see that they spoke to 0. C. Mahelas and M. L. 0. both Officers have practically nothing to do with the discharge of stores. Had they interviewed the M. T. 0. or sent a memo, or telephone message to the P. M. T. 0. the matter would have been put right at once, but such an ob vious coifrse of action does not appear to have appealed to them. The Master over-carried the cargo and considered that in doing so, he was acting in the best interests of the State, in that he saved an extra day's hire. 5. Copies of the daily reports, E (9 sheets) of the progress of the discharge of the Havildar ' are forwarded and show the whole progress made in discharg ing the ship from February 15th to February 28th, and will also prove that there was no delay in discharging this vessel, on the contrary the rate of 300 tons a day for an overside delivery of mixed cargo is rapid working.63 D.

Letter No. 327-5—I.C., Pt .-IX, dated the 31st July 1916. Serial No. 58, From The Joint Secretary to the Government of Burma, Public Works Department, To The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. H-3783, dated the llth May 1916, addressed to the Chief Secretary to this Government, in connec tion with the despatch of the dredger ' Oswald ' for service m Mesopotamia and in reply to commuunicate the following remarks, i? 2. The Principal Port Officer, Burma, and the Executive Engineer, Twan Canal Division, were entrusted with the work of getting the vessel ready and despatching her from Rangoon with aU her machinery and accessories including spares, and on receipt of your letter under reply they were called upon to report fully as to the action taken. I am now to forward a copy of a letter No. 7332- 12-C. I.-21-M. L., dated the 17th June 1916, from the Principal Port Officer, Burma, with its enclosures explaining the case and in doing so to supplement the states ments made therein from the Executive Engineer's report and from the earlier correspondence on the subject. 3. In his letter No. 2468, dated the 5th April 1916, the Director, Royal Indian Marine, remarks that Sir George Buchanan could not have been aware that the ' Oswald ' was not in a state of readiness for work at Basra. This is not the case. The dredger, as despatched from Burma, was capable of work for a couple of months or so without any extensive repairs; but in Burma Public Works Department telegram No. 52, dated the 12th January 1916, to Sir George, a copy !, Of which is forwarded, he was strongly advised that the new camp pump casing Jul S697(w )ad70 and new internal suction pipes should be fittted at Bombay if continuous hard work was required. I am also to forward a copy of telegram No. 1111-27, dated the 14th January 1916, from Sir George Buchanan to Mr. Niven and of Buima Public Works Department telegram No. 66, dated the 17th January 1916, whicli was sent in reply. It may be added that Mr. Niven, who went overland via Calcutta, was fully aware of the condition in which the dredger was leaving Rangoon. He was given a complete set of drawings of the vessel to be handed over to the authorities at Bombay on his way through so that the making of the internal pipes required could be taken in hand before the vessel arrived there. 4. The Director, Royp.l Indian Marine, also states that work which was being carried out to the vessel at Rangoon was stopped for some reason and that she was despatched without such work being completed. On this point I am to invite a reference to the telegrams which passed between the Principal Port Officer, Burma, and the Director, Royal Indian Marine, on the 4th, 6th, and 6th January 1916, of which copies will be found among the enclosures to the Principal Port Officer's letter quoted in paragraph 2 above and to say that the despatch of the dredger before it had been thoroughly overhauled was due to the action of the Director in pressing for its early despatch as it was. In paragraph 3 of your letter you enquire why the instructions contained in Marine Department telegram No. H-394, dated the 17th January 1916, were not complied with. In reply I am to forward herewith a copy of Burma Public Works Department telegram No. 93, dated the 24th January 1916, to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, which gave him the information he required. 5. It is also alleged that the dredger arrived in Bombay without any instruc tions from Rangoon as to the nature of the repairs that were wanted, that the dockyard authorities had to find out for themselves what these were and that in consequence it took longer to effect the necessary repairs than would otherwise have been the case. With regard to this I am to say that as Mr. Niven was made aware of what was required to be done before he left Burma and was given a set of the vessels drawings to be handed over at Bombay and as moreover Mr.Renfrew, the Dredging Master, who had been engaged on the building of the dredger, worked it three years and knew all about it, was fully capable of supply ing all necessary information as to what repairs, etc., were needed to thoroughly fit the dredger for work, it is not easy to understand what difficulties the authori ties at Bombay experienced in the matter. 6. The complaint is also made that the stores and spare parts of the dredger were despatched by 3 different vessels and that the articles were not securely packed and marked so as to allow of ready identification and that this was a source of considerable trouble and confusion when they were landed and taken over at Bombay. In regard to this the Executive Engineer reports as follows :— u The majority of spare parts were sent on the ' Ooloobaria,' a boat which was specially chartered for the trip, a few were sent on the dredger herself. A list of parts were sent by me to the Principal Port Officer, Burma, as Agent for Government Consignments, under my No. 346, dated the 14th January 1916, stating which parts were on the 4 Qoloobaria ' which parts were on the ' Oswald' and which were to follow; those that-had to follow were merely six extra heavy items which the derricks of the ' Ooloobaria' could not lift. These, followed on the 4 Onda ' and a list of them was again sent to the Principal Port Officer, Burma, on the 8th February 1916. ' The Stores Clerk, witt a list of all spare parts and how each was being sent, sailed on [the ' Ooloobaria.' He has had charge of all Twante Canal spares for over two years, had superintended the packing and shipping of all the spares being sent, and being in Bombay should have obviated any confusion such as is described. ' The 6 items sent on the ' Onda ' were not important spares and dredging could have gone on perfectly well without any of them.71 The statement that in the majority of cases, the stores were not even packed but were tied up with gunny and no labels on them is inexplicable. ' Nothing was sent merely rolled up in gunny, all small parts were care fully packed in wooden boxes and numbered. ' Shafts, etc., were greased and had their wearing surfaces covered with wooden battens kept in place with loop irons, this is, I understand the most satisfactory way of packing such articles. It is stated that they were mixed up with other stores and difficult to sort in Bombay. When shipped in Eangoon on the * Ooloobaria, * they were listed, were all together and were in charge of the Store Clerk, any confusion therefore that existed must have taken place at Bombay.' 7. The accompaniments to the Principal Port Officer's letter show that due intimation was given to the Director as to what stores were despatched by each vessel as she left Rangoon for Bombay. 8, .After due consideration of all the facts of the case, His Honour the Lieu tenant-Governor is satisfied that no blame attaches to the Local Officers for any trouble and confusion that has been experienced at Bombay in fitting out the ' Oswald ' and taking over ker stores and that no neglect of duty can be attributed to them. L Letter No. 7332-12-C-21-M.L., dated the 17th June 1916. Prom—Commander S. D. Vale, EJ.M., Principal Port Officer, Burma, To—The Secretary to the Government of Burma, Public Works Department. Tn reply to your endorsement No. 177-5 I.C. Pt. IX., dated 10th June 1916, forwarding copy of correspondence from the Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Burma, and copy of letter from the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, Bombay, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, No. 2468, dated 5th April 1916, I have the hcnour to report as follows on what happened in connection with the Dredger &lt;f Oswald ' and all appliances and stores belonging to her. In paragraph 3 of Secretary to Government of India's letter it is stated that Sir George Buchanan was informed that the Principal Port Officer, Rangoon, stopped some work being done on the Dredger. This statement is not under stood as all work that was done, or to be done, on the dredger was arranged for and carried out by the Superintending Engineer to Government, the Superintend ent of Dalla Dockyard, the Public Works Department Engineers and the Master of the ' Oswald ' and I in no way interfered with any work that was being done. My instructions were only for utmost despatch ; and work to be carried on day and night. I enclose an office note by the Superintending Engineer to Government setting forth what was to be done on the ' Oswald ' before sailing and I understood the work was all completed. It is not understood how on the vessel's arrival at Bombay that considerable repairs were necessary as the vessel was working in the Twante Canal up to the day she was brought down to Rangoon ; so can only imagine she must have damaged herself on the voyage round. As for there being a lack of information in regard to the vessel which made execution of repairs slow I can only say that the Dredging Master Mr. Renfrew was on board and he is supposed to be an expert; also that all plans and drawings of the vessel were, I understand, on board. With reference to despatching stores of dredger in three different vessels the explanation is as follows. All the pipe line was sent in the ' Ooloobaria ' on the 17th January and full information of what was on board telegraphed to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, vide copy of telegram attached, and list of other stores and plant for72 dredger that were also shipped was forwarded by post to the Director, Royal Indian Marine. On the date the ' Ooloobaria ' left everything that was ready belonging to the dredger was shipped, also a lot of gear belonging to river steamers that were being towed to Basra under orders of the Quartermaster General. The next shipment of gear was on the ' Okhla ' which towed the terminal pontoon belonging to the dredger and left here on the 7th February, she also had on board the jibs, boiler and all gear belonging to the terminal pontoon and launches for the Quartermaster General's department, information of which was wired to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, vide copy of a telegram attached. Both the ' Ooloobaria ' and the ' Okhla ' had their deck space absolutely crowded with the above mentioned gear for the dredger and Quartermaster Gener al so even if the terminal pontoon with all its gear had been ready to go (which it was not) when the pipe lines, etc., left in the ' Ooloobaria ' there would have been no room for them as they had to be stowed on deck on account of their size. The next shipment was in the ' Onda ' which* left on the 15th February and she had on board an amount of spare gear for the dredger which was packed and shipped by the Public Works Department and no complaints were made by the ship's people that the stores were not properly packed. I attach copy of a telegram sent to the Director of the^ Royal Indian Marine informing him what was on board. A copy of,letter forwarding bill of lading which was sent to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, of all that was shipped on board the ' Okhla ' is also forwarded for information. In connection with the above quoted facts I do not understand why any blame to the quick despatch of the Dredger ' Oswald ' and all gear, stores, etc., belonging to her, should be attached to any department in Burma as everything was carried out in a most urgent manner and besides which there was a tremendous amount of very urgent work being done at the same time under orders of the Quartermaster General with regard to despatch of river steamers and launches to Basra. Everything that was shipped from here was done so in perfect condition and under proper supervision and I am certain the Masters of the vessels will corroborate this and perhaps they might have a different tale to tell about how it was all unloaded and where it was put. I may mention that the following officers who made all arrangements for sending the Dredger ' Oswald ' with her gear and appliances to Bombay namely Chief Engineer Robertson, R.I.M., Government Superinteding Engineer and Shipwright Surveyor, R. A. Home, Esquire, Superintending Engineer, Dalla Dock yard, Commander A. Bingham, R.I.M., 1st Assistant Port Officer, and Mr. Renfrew, Master of the ' Oswald ' and Expert in Dredging Work, have all gone to Basra where any more information required regarding this matter might be obtained from them. I also attach copy of telegram received from the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, with reference to my telegram No. R. M. 479 (copy enclosed) regarding the despatch of Dredger ' Oswald ' and of my reply thereto, and also of my office order to the 1st Assistant Port Officer and the Superintending Engineer. II. Copy of a note dated the 20th January 1916, hy the Superintending Engineer, and Shipwright Surveyor to the Government of Burma. The dredger is in readiness to start work on arrival and the present pump wearing plates, suction and discharge pipes should last for about three months unless material is very hard. At the end of that time, the new pump need not be fitted if new wearing plates can be obtained (none are available in Rangoon).73 The old pump can always be lifted out and the new pump lifted m hy the pontoon ]ib as is done when at work here. The only difficulty is the krge a I. foining lengths of suction and discharge pipes which may require to have flanges planed. All other lengths of pipes are i' M. S. These are at present fitted with wear ■ ing plates at bottom of pipes and can be renewed at any time when worn out. ' Drawinsa are with Dredging Master of' Oswald ' who can also give full details regarding the method of repairing pipes and pumps, while at work on the Twante Canal. 9 III.

Is there a spare pump casing also spare pipes or nave these to be made ? We have ordered from Simons certain spare parts re commended by Burma Government but presumably these are not required at once. W e have also ordered wire ropes and anchors it is impossible for me trom Basra to go into all these details and I supposed you could have been consult- . ^ require the dredger to arriveherefit to start work and you must arrange m Bombay with Director, Marine and Port Trust to obtain what is necessary to carry on without waiting for spares and wire ropes from England. XIII Telegram No. 661, dated the 17th January 1916. From—The Government of Burma, Public Works Department, To—Sir George Buchanan , Basrah. Niven reports reference your wire concerning dredger. Spare pump casing shipped to Bombay and will be fitted there. Internal suction and discharge pipes will be made in Bombay and sent to Basra when ready. The latter not required for immediate use. All spare parts and wires and anchors not required for imme diate use but as safeguards. Terminal pontoon anchor boat and special anchor pontoons will be despatched as soon as ready. XIV. Telegram No. 931, dated the 24th January 1916, From—The Government of Burma, Public Works Department, To—The Director, Royal Indian Marine. Your A. S.-514, dated January 15th. One set drawings given Niven now in Bombay another set on ' Oswald.' Pipes are quarter inch mild steel 24 inches diameter. No need for dredger to await construction of pipes, she can work two or three months with existing pipes and fit new ones in Mesopotamia if sent after her. If pipes cannot be made wearing plates might be made to bottom of pipes as existing. New pump, casing with joining lengths to suction and discharge pipes are on ' Ooloobaria ' cast steel flanges will probably require planing hence recommendation to fit in Bombay or near workshops. Old pump - casing probably fit for few months work. It can be lifted out and new casing lifted in with a six ton jib. Dredging Master sailing on dredger can give full explanation of all methods of effecting repairs. Telegram P., No. 1382-1-Q., dated the 17th February 1916.

Buchanan, after personal inspection, considers that by next low water season great improvements can be made in the river from Qurnah, to Amarah, which is now so difficult to navigate. This opinion is to be confirmed by survey. Since the safety of transit and the reduction to a minimum of risks of accidents and con sequent delays render this so desirable, will you kindly find out particulars of all dredgers of the same class as that now coming from Burma, but preferably one with a draught not exceeding 4 feet. It is suggested by Buchanan that information might be obtained through the Secretary to the Government*of India, Public Works Department.• 76 Kindly treat matter as urgent, as in all probability two of tbese dredgers will be required.

In order to facilitate this briefly specifications, i.e., if pipe line and pontoons including terminal pontoon necessary, if so draught of latter and length for former and to what height matei ial to be raised. Please state whether the ability for the dredge, to cut her own flota tion is necessary. Serial No. 61. Telegram P.„ No. 1382-4-Q., dated the 28th February 1916. (Despatched 11-45 a.m ., received 10-55 p.m.) From-—The General Officer Commanding, Force ' D,' Basrah*, To—The Chief of the General Staff. Your telegram 40102 of February 22nd. This telegram deals with dredgers. Jt is stated by Sir G. Buchanan that the dredgers are needed to ease bends and make bars lower over a stretch of river on the Tigris, which is some 200 300 feet wide and 20 miles in length. A draught of four feet should not be exceeded by the dredgers ; a lesser draught \yould be preferred:. During operations traffic must be kept open. The suction pump type of dredger with rotary cutter would be a suitable class, draught of vessel should not exceed 4 feet and length should not be greater than 150 feet. It should have a terminal pontoon which could lift material 10 feet at least above water level, and should have a pipe line 500 feet long. Sir G. Buchanan may, as he wishes to improve the worst bends and bars in time for the low water seasons, commencing in August, and as time is an essential factor, have to adopt whatever is available, if draught is suitable ; he does not therefore wish to tie himself to specifying exact requirements. Sir G. Buchanan suggests that some of the dredgers used by the Irrigation and Waterway Department of Government of Bengal might be made to meet this emergency. That the dredgers should cut their own flotation is not an absolute essential. Serial No. 62. Telegram P., No. H.-1734, dated the 8th March 1916. From—The Viceroy (Army Department), To—The Secretary of State for India. Dredging operations in Mesopotamia.' It is reported by General Officer Commanding ' D ' that after personal inspection. Sir George Buchanan thinks that by next low water season, great improvements can be made in the river from Qurnah to Amarah. This opinion is feo be confirmed after survey. Two dredgers will probably be required for this work, and suction pump type with rotary cutter is recommended by Sir George Buchanan as a suitable class. Draught not to exceed four feet, but it would be preferable if vessel of less draught is obtainable. Length not to exceed 150 feet. A terminal pontoon which could lift material 10 feet at least above water level should be with each dredger, also 500 feet pipe line. Not absolutely necessary that dredgers should cut their own flotation. An essen tial factor is time, and Sir George Buchanan is prepared to carry on with whatever is available so long as draught is suitable, since he wishes to improve the worst bends and bars in time for the low water seasons. We are making endeavoursto procure in this country dredgers fulfilling Sir George's essential requirements. As, however, the requisite type may not be got. Please let us know whether, should the necessity arise, they could be obtained at home at short notice.
