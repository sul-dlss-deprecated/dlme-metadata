GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE RIVER. (4) The Shatt-el-Arab river is formed by the united streams of the rivers Description of Euphrates and Tigris, and in 1837 when Colonel Chesney made his survey of the River, rivers, the Euphrates flowing within well-defined banks joined the Tigris at Kurna, forty-six miles above Basra ; but between that date and the present, the Euphrates has broken through its right bank and cut a channel into the Shatt-el-Arab at Gurmat Ali six miles above Basra. C71(w)AD * These charts are in a separate portfolio.Towns on river banks. From Basra tlie river runs in a south-easterly direction, Joining the waters of the Persian Gulf in latitude 29°'57 nortt, and longitude 48°'32 east, the distance from Basra to the Outer Bar being 67 miles. The width of the river varies from 1,000 feet at Margil—5 miles above Basra, and the site of the new port—to 1,500 feet opposite the town of Basra ; 1 mile a£ Fao, and 1-| miles opposite the Turkish Fort 3 miles below Facr. Tributaries. (5) The only tributaries of the Shatt-el-Arab worthy of notice are the Suwaib and the Karun. The Suwaib, which enters the Shatt-el-Arab on the left bank just below Kurna, is formed by a portion of the Kerkha river which rises in the Pusht-i-Kuh hills, along with a certain quantity of the Tigris water which finds its way down the 1 Chahala canal and through the marshes. The Karun river rises in the Bakhtiari mountains at a height of some 11,000^ feet above sea level, and joins the Shatt-el-Arab on its left bank 20 miles below Basra. (6) The town of Basra is situated on the right bank of the river at its junction with the Ashar Creek, the only other town of importance being the Persian town of Mohammerah, which is situated on the left bank of the river at its junction with the Karun. Fourteen miles below Mohammerah is Abadan, where are located the works'- and refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and at Fao, a village on the right bank of the river 55 miles below Basra, is established the office of the Eastern Telegraph Company. irrigation canals. (7) From Basra to Fao the banks of the Slatt-el-Arab are intersected by numerous irrigation canals, and these serve to water the almost continuous, belt of date palms which has a depth inland of 1 to 2 miles on either bank. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS. (8) The discharge of the Shatt-el-Arab, when the rivers Tigris, Euphrates rivers and quality an d Karun are in flood simultaneously, amounts to some 300,000 cusecs ; and the 01 water - low-water discharge may be taken at from 40,000 to 60,000 cusecs ; but these figures are only approximate, and observations require to be taken very much more carefully than has hitherto been the case, and over a long period of time. Throughout the year the river water opposite Basra is quite fresh, and even at Fao fresh water is obtained from the river on the ebb tide, especially during the- high-water season ; and during the low-water season the water is always fresh on the ebb tide a few miles above Fao. Fl00ds . (9) The rivers Euphrates and Tigris are in flood from the beginning of March to the end of July, and at the height of the floods both rivers frequently overflow their banks and inundate some hundreds of square miles of country. The flood seasons of 1915 and 1916 are said by the local inhabitants to have reached a much higher level than has been known for many years, causing inundations m Basra and the surrounding country. In 1915 the floods were attributed to unknown causes at the sources of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, possibly a late spring and a sudden melting of the snows in Armenia. In 1916 the floods were said by the local inhabitants to be due to the con struction of the Shaiba and Zubeir bunds, which prevented the surplus water from the Euphrates passing into the Khor Abdulla. No data is available as to thequantity of water which, found its way to the Khor Abdulla before the completion of the Shaiba bund, but the tidal records do not shew any raising of the water level in the Shatt-el-Arab ; on the contrary, the level during the months of March and April 1916 was considerably lower than in 1915. (10) In my opinion, the floods at Basra are generally caused by a high river ^5™' meeting a spring tide ; and exceptionally high floods are brought about if, in addi tion to the above, there is a strong south wind blowing. Under such circum stances, I am informed the town of Mohammerah was once two feet under water- Floods were not unknown at Basra previous to 1915, as will be seen from the following extract from the Consular Eeport, 1896 :— ' In the spring tlie waters of the Euphrates and Tigris rose to an abnormal height, inundat ing the country for miles round. The oldest inhabitants of these parts have no recollection of the occurrence during their life-time of a similar flood. Much damage was done to the date trees by the high water in the Shatt-el-Arab, which flooded the date groves and remained stagnant, thus utterly destroying, it is estimated, about two million trees.' (11) At Basra tidal records have been kept since January 1915, from which Tidal records at \ ' # Basra. I have collated the following information The time the tide takes to reach Basra from Fao averages from to 6| hours, and the heights vary considerably; both time and height depending largely on the direction and strength of the wind and the up-river floods. The highest high-water level in 1915 was recorded on the 30th April, when it reached 8 • 61 feet above mean sea level, the date coinciding with a spring tide of 6 feet 7 inches at Bushire. The highest level in 1916 was recorded on the 20th May, when it reached 8-80 feet above mean sea level, which coincided with a spring tide of 6 feet 5 inches at Bushire. The lowest low-water level both in 1915 and 1916 occurred in the month of November, when 2 feet below mean sea level was recorded. The range of tide from highest high-water to lowest low-water was, on an average, 5*36 feet during the months of January, February, and March ; 3'33 feet during the months of April, May, and June ; 5-54 feet during the months of July, August, and September ; and 7*37 feet during the months of October, November, and December. The least daily range was 1-2 feet to 2*5 feet in the months of April, May, June, and July, and the greatest daily range, 5 feet 6 inches to 8 feet in October, November, and December. (12) The tides were observed at Fao regularly, day and night, from July Tidal records at 1916 to the date of this report, but sufiicient time has not yet been devoted to the the Bar * subject to obtain scientifically accurate observations. The time of high water full moon and change, otherwise known as the mean establishment, is 0 hours 12 minutes at Fao. The springs rise 8^ to 9 feet, neaps rise 6 to 7 feet, neaps range 4 to 5 feet. During August and September, at springs, the day tides are the highest; but during neaps, the n ; ght tides are the highest. During September, October, and November, the lowest high-waters and the lowest low-waters are experienced ; the low-waters occasionally falling below the datum of soundings, and rising to 8 feet at neaps. During October, November, and December the night tides are always the highest, and from January the day tides are highest. A temporary tide gauge was erected on the Outer Bar and comparisons made with the readings at Fao, and it was found that there was no regularity in the timeCollection of data Obstructions. Sinking of ' Ekbatana ' and other vessels. Proposal to blow up the ' Ekbatana.' The Mohammc-r rah Bar. The Outer Bar. and height between them. The Fao tide varied from 0 to 1J hours later than on the Bar, and the rise on the Bar from 0 to 2j feet higher than at Fao, independent of weather conditions. The tides are much influenced by the wind, and are from 1 to 2j feet higher with a southerly wind, and correspondingly lower with a strong northerly wind. In the absence of any tide tables specially prepared for the port, the nearest approximation is to take the time of high-water at Bushire for any day of the month and add thereto 3 hours 47 minutes for the time of high-water on the Outer Bar, and an addition of 15 feet to the height of water any day at Bushire gives approximately the depth of water on the Outer Bar under normal conditions, (13) An accurate marine survey plotted on sheets to a scale of 1,000 feet to the inch has been made of the whole river, along with special surveys, plotted to a larger scale, of the Outer Bar and the Port of Basra, Levels have been taken, and permanent benchmarks reduced to mean sea level erected, between Fab and Basra ; and automatic tide gauges have been procured and will be erected at Fao, Mohammerah, Basra and Kurna. The strength and direction of the currents on the ebb and flood tide, the amount of silt in suspension, the dis charge of the river during highrflood and low-water seasons and accurate tidal observations, are works requiring to be taken in hand so soon as opportunity occurs, OBSTRUCTIONS TO NAVIGATION, (14) With the exception of the Outer Bar, the Mohammerah Bar, and the obstruction to the channel above Mohammerah caused by the sinking of the Hamburg-Amerika steamer ' Ekbatana ' by the Turks, the river from Basra to the Gulf presents no difficulties to navigation. The channel is wide with a depth at low-water on spring tides of 30 to 40 feet, and there are no awkward bends or turns. (15) On the advance of th§ British force in November 1914, the Turks, attempted to block the navigable channel 4 miles above Mohammerah by sinking the Hamburg-Amerika steamer ' Ekbatana ' and two other vessels in the fairway. The idea was a-good one, but one of the vessels was carried away by the current and sank out of its allotted position. The attempt therefore failed, and a gap was left through which passed the transports and warships of the expedition. (16) An attempt was made to salve the ' I^kbatana ' but it was unsuccessful, and the vessel has now §unk into the bed of the river to such an extent that only her funnel anc|. a portion of her masts are showing above water level, It is useless to make furthep attempts to raise the pf Ekbatana,' and, in my opinion, she must l)e blown up, as such an obstructipn cannot tie permitted remain in the fairway of the riyer. (17) This bar forms below the junction of the Karun and Shatt-eLArab rivers where the latter bifurcates at Dabba Island, and is the result of natural physical causes. It |s its worst when the Karun r|ver is in flood before the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and is least when all the rivers are in flood simultaneously. A chart of the bar as |t appeared at the end of M:ay 1910 is appended to this report, and the removal of the worst patches by dredging was accomplished in a few days in the month of April 1917 and presents no difficulty in the future. (18) Below Fao, the river widens rapidly, and finally, after ploughing its way thmiigh miles of sand and mud flats, mingles its waters with those of the PersianGulf ; and where the river currents have exhausted their energy, fluvial matter has been deposited and a bar formed. Although the Persian Gulf is not a tideless sea, the tidal currents are weak in comparison with those of the river, and the conditions at the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab river are similar to those obtaining at the mouth of the Mississippi and other rivers of that class. The immense amount of solid matter carried by the river in suspension, or rolled along its bed, has been deposited at its mouth forming a delta through which the river has found its way to the sea by one or more comparatively shallow channels. The delta is continually advancing seawards, the depth of the sea in front, and the direction of the prevalent winds and currents being important factors in its progress, and in the preparation of engineering schemes for increasing the depth of water in the channel. (19) The earliest survey of the Shatt-el-Arab of which there is any Earliest survey record appears to be that made by Colonel Chesney's expedition in 1837. This S^att-el-Arab. survey shewed two channels branching ofi near the mouth of the river ; the Western channel was straight with an inner and outer bar, the former was situated at the bifurcation and had only 16 feet of water over it at H. W. 0. S. T,, whilst the channel between the bars carried 34 feet, and the outer bar had 17 to 19 feet over it at high- water and was about 4 miles broad. The Eastern channel carried from 17 to 20 feet for 8 miles, when it deepened rapidly to 30 and 40 feet. (20) The first detailed chart is apparently that made by Lieutenant Gunn, First detailed K.N., in November-December 1890, and it also shows two channels through the chart of Bar * mud flats :■— ♦ One (the Eastern channel) running nearly due east from the Turkish fort below Fao until it joined the mouth of the Bahmishir river, whilst the other, or Western channel, ran in almost a straight line between the centre of the river at Fao and the Turkish fort respectively. The Eastern channel carried the best water, but had many bends and was not used. The channel used for navigation was the Western channel; the whole length of 10 miles was, however, one long bar or shallow channel carrying 18 to 20 feet of water at H. W. O. S. T. There was also a blind channel or gut midway between the Eastern and Western channels, which started at the junction of'the two channels and ran parallel to the Western channel. This blind gut was 6 miles long and carried 20 to 24 feet of water at H. W. 0. S. T. (21) In 1905, there was a partial survey of the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab, Subsequent which shewed that great changes were taking place ; the blind gut between the surve y s * Eastern and Western channels was developing into the main channel, and the old Eastern and Western channels had disappeared. The date of the next completed survey was 1911. A further great improvement was recorded : the new channel had been maintained and improved, the Inner Bar carried a minimum of 23 feet of water at H. W. O. S. T., and the Outer Bar was greatly curtailed in breadth and, with the exception of one small patch, carried a minimum depth of 23 feet at H. W. O. S. T. The last survey is the one that has just been completed under my direction, and although the Inner Bar has entirely gone there being a minimum depth of 26 feet 7l(w)AD6. of water at H. W. Q, S. T,, where this bar existed the Outer Bar has increased to a serious extent and is much broader and three feet higher than it was in 1911. I am disposed to think that this deterioration is caused by the material scoured from the Inner Bar having been carried along and deposited on the Outer Bar. Outer Bar at (22) The Bar as it exists to-day begins at t.he 12th mile from Fao, where there P e t ay. j s a depth of water of 17 feet below L. W. 0- S,. T., thence it rises to its crest at the 14th mile where there is only a depth of water of 10 feet at L. W. 0. S. T. and it continues at that level until the 16th mile, afterwards falling rapidly to the 19th mile where there is a depth of 30 feet. The material composing the Bar is fine sand and silt with occasional patches, of coarser sand ; in some places there is a little more silt overlying the sand than at others—hence the erroneous impression that the Bar was composed of different materials, and that it was hard on one side of the channel and soft on the other. There is nothing complex about the nature of the Ba^ which does not differ- from those blocking the entrances to many similar rivers. But it constitutes a very serious impediment to navigation. If no action is taken to improve matters, I consider it not unlikely that, with the steady increase of the Outer Bar, the river will break through in another direction—possibly re-opening the old eastern channel, and bringing about a state of affairs similar to that which obtained in 1890. I need hardly point out the gravity, from the point of view of navigation, of such a retrogression. THE REMOVAL OF THE OUTER BAR. Procedure neces- ( 23 ) There are only two methods of deepening and maintaining a navigable s ar y- % channel across a bar at the mouth of a river flowing through a delta channel, i.e., (i) by confining the channel between parallel jetties^ and, after preliminary dredge ing operations, making the concentrated river current scour the bar ; (ii) dredg ing a channel through the bar and maintaining it by constant dredging. In the case under review, the bar is so far from the beginning of the delta channel as to render parallel training walls impracticable on account of their great cost, and, in my judgment, the following procedure will be necessary :— (a) The river must be kept in one channel through the mud flats, as other wise its strength and scouring powers will be dissipated and a general deterioration in the depth of water will take place. I recommend that a training wall be built in the position shewn on plan No. 5 'the training wall being in shallow water would not be verv costly and would be built of rubble obtained probably from the neighbourhood of Koweit, conveyed in shallow draught hopper barges, and dumped on the site at high-water, (ft) The Outer Bar must be dredged, and with modern dredging plant there should be no difficulty in cutting a channel and maintaining the same to any required depth. Qn the assumption that, in the first instance, a channel 25 feet deep at H. W. O. S. T. and 500 feet broad will meet the requirements of trade, the quantity of material to be dredged will be about 2| million tons. ^(24) The material composing tlie bar is of a nature and consistency that can ® r e e s d C gJJg 10 p la ° f t very well be dealt with by a suction pump dredger, and of this class there are three principal types (i) The bow well suction dredger built with or without a cutter, discharging its spoil through a pipe-line, and usually self-propelling. (n) The self-propelling bow well suction hopper dredger, built either with or without rotary cutter. {Hi) The self-propelling stern well drag suction hopper dredger. The following is a more detailed description of these machines:— (1) A pipe-line dredger is admirably adapted for reclamation work or for work in a river where the spoil can be deposited behind a bund, or otherwise clear of the current, but would not be suitable in a sea-way, because, apart from the difficulty of pumping the material dredged far enough from the channel, a sudden storm would break up the pipe line before there was time to make it secure. The dredgers ' Kalu ' and ' Jinga ' built for the Bombay Port Reclamation Works, the ' Oswald ' built for the Twante Canal Works in Burma and now at work in Mesopotamia, and the dredger ff Pelican built for the Rangoon River Training Works, are all good types of the modern powerful pipe-line suction dredger. (2) A self-propelling bow well suction dredger is a type which is largely used for work on sea and river bars, and in combination with a rotary cutter is especially efficient in the cutting of clay and hard silt, but in soft silt and sand a drag suction dredger is, in my judgment and from actual experience, the more suitable machine, because the bow suction dredger works against head moorings—entailing considerable loss of time in mooring and un-mooring, is liable to dredge in pockets, and to form lumps from overside spill. The dredger ' Balari ' built for the Calcutta Port Commissioners is a very fine specimen of a modern vessel of this class ; she carries 3,000 tons of spoil in her hoppers, and dredges at the rate of 5,000 tons of sand and silt per hour ; but I think it is recognised that for the work she is doing on the river Hooghly, a drag suction dredger would be more efficient. (3) A stern well drag suction, or, as it is sometimes called, trailing suction dredger, is a comparatively modem invention. The vessel has no moorings, and when working steams slowly ahead dragging behind her the suction head. So soon as the hopper is full, there is no delay in un-mooring : the suction head is lifted and the dredger steams off to the dumping ground, and after depositing her load returns to her work. The dredger ' Cormorant' belonging to the Rangoon Port Commissioners and recently at work on the Fao bar, is a good type of this class of dredger ; and more powerful ones, are those built for the Argentine Government to dredge the shipping channel from the river Plate to the Buenos Ay res docks. As an experimental measure, the dredger ' Cormorant ' already referred to was procured from Rangoon and set to work on the Bar in the month of July IQie' and between that date and April 1917, she did most useful work removing some 400,000 tons of material and reducing the Bar by one foot to 18 inches *8 thus proving the efficiency of her class and its ability to dredge the material of which the Bar is composed. The ' Cormorant ' is, however, too small for such a large work, and the type of dredger I recommend for the permanent work is as describ ed below.

The vessel to be fitted with a centrifugal suction pump and a drag suction frame working in an open stem well capable of dredging to a depth of 46 feet below light water level when the suction frame is at an angle of about 45°. The suction frame to be fitted so that the vessel may steam slowly ahead while pumping. Discharge pipes to be fitted for filling the vessel's own hopper; also arranged to discharge overboard at deck level into barges alongside, or connect with over board discharge pipe-line. The pump to be capable of discharging- through 5Q0 feet of shore discharge piping, and self-discharging arrangements to be provided so that the pump may- suck silt and soft mud from the hopper. The hopper to be specially arranged so that the silt and mud raised by the suction pump can be discharged through the ordinary hopper doors, or pumped from the hopper through a. suction keelson and discharged overboard by the suction pump. (26) I am of the opinion that two dredgers will be necessary for the improve ment of the channel in the first instance, and although after the Bar has been dredged to the depth of 25 feet below H. W. 0. S.. T. one dredger may suffice to maintain the channel,;—it. will have to work constantly, and it will be advisable; to have the second dredger in reserve when one or other is undergoing repairs, boiler cleaning, etc. The total quantity of material to be removed in the first instance is 2|- million tons, and assuming that each dredger made 5 trips a day and carried on each trip 2,000 tons of spoil, and worked 2Q days a month, the time required would be about 12 months. Nummary of re- ( 27 ) 1 attach great importance to early action otherwise I fear further deterio- commendations, ration and possible complications, and my definite recommendations are as follows r (1) During the next cold weather the present survey of the channel between Fao and the Outer Bar should be extended to the eastward and completed to the Bahmishir river. (2) A detailed survey should be made on the line of the proposed training; wall,, and borings taken.(3) Investigations should be made as to the best locality from whicli to procure the necessary stone rubble for the wall. (4) On the completion of the surveys and investigations, a complete estimate to be prepared. (5) Detailed specifications for the dredgers to be prepared, and tenders in vited from builders. The placing of the order and the time within .which the vessels can be completed will naturally depend upon the war and the general situation in the United Kingdom in respect to shipbuilding. LIGHTING AND BUOYING. (28) To improve the navigation of a river, buoys are placed in suitable posi- Usual procedure, tions to mark shoal patches or turns in the direction of the course, and lights are established to enable the river to be navigated at night-time. As already stated,. under Turkish rule no encouragement was given to shipowners to send their ships to the port; there were a few buoys laid down on the Outer Bar, but the charts contain the statement: ' All the buoys are of a rusty black colour and they are not to be depended upon.' (29) Now that the survey of the river between Basra and the Ghilf is completed. Proposal to mark it will be possible to put down such buoys in the river, and marks and leading lights and buoy the riVer * on shore, as will make navigation—either by night or day—perfectly simple to any shipmaster ; and a scheme on these lines is being drawn up. (30) A certain amount of work has already been carried out on the Outer Bar, Action already and as the plans were laid before, and sanctioned by, the Secretary of State for India, taken • it seems desirable to describe in some detail the action taken : So long ago as the 15th December 1915, an urgent requisition was sent to the Chief of the General Staff, Delhi, on the representation of the Principal Marine Transport Officer, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D,' for 3 lighted buoys of the ' Aga ' type, to allow vessels to cross the Bar by night; and on the 1st of Jan uary 1916, a telegram was received from the Chief of the General Staff stating that he had accepted an offer of the Trinity House, London, to supply 3 buoys which were available at Colombo and he would send lanterns, moorings and stores from London about the middle of January. It was also arranged that the buoys on arrival were to be taken over as part of the Persian Gulf Lights and Buoys Establishment, and that the Officer Com manding the E. I. M. S. ' Nearchus ' was to lay them in the positions required and subsequently to tend them as necessary. (31) Meanwhile the Admiralty had also moved in the matter and 'on the 28th December 1915, the Secretary to the Admiralty addressed the Under Secre tary of State, India Office, forwarding certain suggestions put forward by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, respecting navigational lights to mark the channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. The suggestions which had the approval of the Admiralty were to the effect that buoys No. 9 on the Inner Bar, and No. 6 and No. 4 on the Outer Bar, should be fitted with flashing and occulting lights ; and the Fao light altered from a fixed light to either a flashing or occulting light. (32) The Admiralty were informed that several changes had already been made in the various lights ; that in order to enable transports to cross the Bar at night, three additional gas buoys had been ordered as an urgent military necessity and would be placed in position on the Bar very shortly, and that it would be advisable to wait the result of these measures before taking further action.10 (33) The three gas buoys arrived some time in January and the lanterns in 'May, and on the15th July 1916, the Secretary of State for India was asked by telegram to sanction the placing of the buoys in the following positions, which had been approved by the Director, Royal Indian Marine : one buoy about 2 cables S.-S.-E. from No. 4 buoy, and the other two buoys to replace No. 9 Inner Bar buoy and No. 7 buoy -; the present gas buoy at the Outer Bar buoy to be removed to the position of the Old Bar buoy, and a small chequered buoy placed in the position of the present Outer Bar buoy, and that the light at Fap should be temporarily improved by changing it to 2 vertical white lights on a flagstaff. the present UP t9 (34) The Secretary of State for India sanctioned the scheme by telegram on the 12th August J.916, and the work .actually done up to the present has been as follows; -— • (1) The Ijiner Bar buoy has been replaced by a white-flash lighted buoy. (2) No. 4 buoy has been replaced by a red-flash lighted buoy, put down on 21st November 1916, (3) A large can unlighted buoy has been substituted for the small buoy at No. 7^now No. 6. (4) A lamp has been ordered for the Fao light. Additions required (35) With reference to the remainder of the proposed programme, it is not schenief 1018 pow recommended that the present outer gas buoy should be removed to the position of the Old Bar buoy, and the consensus of opinion is, that the following additions are required to complete the scheme - {a) A lighted buoy at the Old Bar buoy, (6) A lighted buoy at No. 7 (now No. 6), (c) An occulting white light to show JO miles at Fao. Plan No. 9 accompanying this report shews the buoys as at present and pro posed. Type of buoy (36) The gas buoys sent from Colombo -are unsuitable as they are of too deep recommended. a draught. There is also difiiculty in re-filling them with carbide when there is a sea running. I recommend that all the lighted buoys on the Ear be replaced by ' Aga ' light buoys drawing not more than 4 feet of water and charged with * dissolved acetylene ' gas in accordance with the ' Aga ' Standard Process, and manufac tured by the Gas Accumulator Company (United Kingdom) Limited.

PILOTAGE. (39) In the case of difficult rivers, competent persons specially licensed as pilots are entrusted to navigate the vessels from the bar to port, when they are hand ed over to the harbour masters. Before the war there were a certain number of Arabs, who, by navigating dhows and other native craft up and down the river, had obtained a superficial knowledge of the best channel. When the expeditionary force came to Basra, the first ships were piloted by their own captains or by Eoyal Navy or Royal Indian Marine officers, but after a time one of the old Arab pilots was taken on and kept continually employed. Other Arab pilots gradually found their way back and a pilot service was instituted. None of these pilots possesses a navigation certificate—their only qualification being that they have been doing pilot work for a varying number of years. One of them was for some time in command of a ship belonging to the Persian Navy ; whilst another has been a pilot at Bandar Abbas and Bahrein. The pilots come mostly from the Island of Kharab, north of Bushire, or are descendants of the inhabitants there, and although perhaps capable men on dhows or luggalows, it is, in my opinion, doubtful if they are fully qualified to take charge of the permanent pilotage of a large port. (40) The work of the pilots is not confined to crossing the Bar, they pilot vessels all the way up-river to Basra where they hand over to European harbour masters below the shipping ; but on the downward voyage, until recently, they took charge of the vessels in the harbour and turned and piloted them through the lines of shipping — a practice attended with great danger, as the usual custom, even where there are European pilots, is for the harbour master to take the shipping out of the docks or through the harbour proper handing over charge to the pilots below the shipping. The reason for the unusual practice in Basra was the shortage of European harbour masters, but additions have now been made to the establishment and it is hoped that very shortly the Arab pilots will be relieved of all pilotage work within the harbour. (41) The pilots are paid fees according to the draught of the vessels they pilot Pay of pilots, and on a schedule of rates drawn up shortly after the British occupation in Novem ber 1914. The scale appears to be unnecessarily liberal. I understand that before the war, pilots who earned Rs. 150 a month considered themselves to be doing well; but under the sanctioned schedule, the average earnings of pilots for the 6 months ending 31st March 1917 was Rs. 755. This is a considerable reduction On the earnings for the first 6 months of the year, and the Port Officer is not in favour of any immediate change in the schedule. If compulsory pilotage continues to be necessary when the various improve ments suggested in this note have been carried out, the establishment of a European pilot service on a proper financial basis is indicated, the earnings of the pilots being subject to a deduction of a certain percentage for the upkeep of the pilot vessel and administration of the service. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, which does a great deal of lightering at the Bar, and the British India Steam Navi gation Company, Limited, may prefer to make their own arrangements as to pilotage, and to this I can see no objection provided that they made a contribution to the12 pilot fund in satisfaction of the revenue which would be lost to it through the employment of their own men. improvements (42) The following improvements in the working of the pilot service have already effected. a l r eady been made under my direction (1) A steam pilot vessel with a competent European pilot master in com mand has been placed on the station. Until recently the Light Vessel was used as a combined pilot vessel and light vessel ; a most un satisfactory arrangement, as it was quite impossible for the Port s Officer to effectively control and supervise the movements, discip line and general maintenance of the pilot service at the Bar, a dis tance of 70 miles from the port, the consequence being that pilots were not under proper control. A European pilot master now posts the pilots to vessels, and is also able to supervise and check their work. (2) A detailed survey has been made of the Ear and the best track laid out, and charts which are checked by re-survey from time to time, are furnished to the pilots. Formerly the pilots went where they pleased ; if they did not get across the Bar on one track, they tried another. FINANCIAL. (43) In order to pay for river improvement works, it is usual to levy dues on ships and goods entering or leaving the port. Dues on ships are generally levied on the nett registered tonnage, and on goods by the ton weight. Under existing conditions it is difficult to make any proposals in this respect, as it is not possible to forecast the extent of trade after the war either in vessels or in goods. It is also impossible to estimate accurately the cost of the works until further information is collected and the survey is made that is detailed in paragraph 27 of this report; but I estimate approximately the cost of the works (including the capital cost of the dredgers at present prices) at £600,000. In my report on the development of the Port of Basra, I have remarked that it is universally recognized that the interest on the capital cost of port and river, development works cannot, in their earlier stages, be wholly paid out of the charges imposed, and that the State or other controlling power must in the general in terest be prepared to undertake financial responsibility. I suggest that, in the first instance, the cost of the works should be a charge against the State, to be ultimately transferred as a debt to the Port Tiust and Eiver Conservancy Board which administers the port and river. CONCLUSION. (44) The works recommended in this report cannot be regarded as absolutely necessary for the prosecution of the war, but it is an undoubted fact that all future developments in Mesopotamia will depend first and foremost on the facilities given for the navigation of vessels of deep draught to and from the Port of Basra. The Mesopotamian Trade Commission in paragraph 70 of their report, remark that it is highly desirable the dredging of the Bar should be carried out as soon as possible, and the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited—and, in directly, the Admiralty—are alone of almost sufficient importance to warrant the execution of the work. I submit that at least the preliminary works and investigations recommended in paragraph (27) of this report should be carried out at once. Dated, Simla, the 20th June 1917. GEORGE C. BUCHANAN. G. M.

In 1912-13, 201 steam vessels of 325,000 tons register entered the port and the value of the imports and exports for the year 1913-14 was £826,000 and £602^000, respectively» Communicationsi —Bushire is the terminus of the ancient caravan route via Kazarin to Shiraz and Ispahan, and transport is effected almost entirely by pack muleg, part of the route being very difficult and precipi tous. Proposals have been made for improving the caravan route and for a railway to Shiraz, distance about 170 miles, and thence to Ispahan. The Trade Commission remark that they believe in the future of Bushire as a collecting and distributing area up to Shiraz and for an extensive littoral area, but doubt whether the connexion between Shiraz and Ispahan will afford the best route for Central Persia in view of the easier route via Ahwaz and the permanent disabilities of Bushire as a harbour. Port Facilities. —Vessels usually anchor 4 to 4J miles from the shore where there is little shelter from storms. Vessels not exceeding 17 feet draught can lie in the inner anchorage If miles from the shore, but this anchorage is not popular and is seldom used. It is a matter for con sideration whether the approach to the inner anchorage could be deepened by dredging or whether the construction of a long breakwater would be feasible, but the consensus of opinion appears to be that harbour improvements would be very costly and only justifiable if there is a prospect of a very large increase in trade. C80(w)AD16 (ii) Bandar Abbas. Trade. —Bandar Abbas serves Kirman, wbicli is a distributing centre for South-West and Central Persia and to a smaller extent Western Afghanistan and Khorasan. In 1912-13, 110 steam vessels having a ' registered tonnage of 224,871 entered the port, whilst the value of the import and export trade in 1913-14 was £459,000 and £266,700, respectively. Communications:. —There is a fairly good road for pack animals to Kirman, and a reconnaissance survey for a railway has been made to that town, a distance of 437 miles ; a survey is also in hand for a motor road. Port Facilities. —The roadstead is well sheltered except from the south east ; but the 4-fathom anchorage is 2 miles from the shore, and that for larger ships 4 miles from the shore. There is a landing pier 110 yards long for lighters, but they can only go alongside from about 3 hours before to 3 hours after high-water, as the remainder of the time the pier is dry. Landing arrangements are also liable to complete Stoppage in rough weather.. An alternative site for the port has been discovered at Bostaneh, 18 miles west of Bandar Abbas, where sound ings shewed an average depth of 40 feet at low-water for an anchorage area of 5. miles with the 3 and 5-fathom line within 180 and 200 yards distant from the low-water line. (iii) Lingah. f rode.-Reives Lar, Jahrum, Bustak, etc. In 1913-14,, 86 steam vessels having a tonnage of 169,585 entered the port, and the value of the imports and exports was £180,000 and £126,000, respectively. Communications.—The inland routes to Lar, Bustak and Jahrum are good and safe. Port Facilities.—The 5-fathom anchorage is | mile from the shore. There is a quay at the customs house, and two boat basins, but in rough weather there is great delay in landing cargo owing to boats being, unable to enter the basins. On the western side— (i) Bahrein. Agriculturally and commercially Bahrein is reported as being the; most valuable district, on the western side of the Persian Gulf. It, serves, the mainland and is the principal pearl market in the Gulf.. In 19X2-13, 117 vessels having a tonnage of 222,000, entered the port and the total value of. the imports and exports in 1913-14 were : imports, £1,878,000 inclusive of pearls and specie valued at £897,252 ; exports, £1,740,000 inclusive of pearls and specie valued at £1,556,500. Communications^ —By native craft with the mainland, the internal com munications being by donkey; Port Facilities—The anchorage is a bad one, and at certain states of the tide- vessels have to he 4 miles from the shore, which is not even approachable 1 by boats — passengers, mails, and cargo having to be landed on donkeys at some distance from the shore. (ii) Koweit. Trade,-, —Koweit serves the immediate surrounding country, but is not of commercial importance as it is situated in a desert with neither industries; nor agriculture, nor any prospect of either.17 Communications.^^ the exception of a oararan route across the desert, there are no inland communications. Port Facilities. Koweit is situated in a bay 20 miles long by 10 miles broad, and vessels anchor from 1 to 3 miles off tlie shore. The port came into notice some years ago as the possible terminus of the Baghdad Railway and the principal port of Mesopotamia, and recently a proposal for developing the port and building a railway from Koweit to Bt sra was isciissed in connexion with military operations, with a view to avoidmg the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab and increas- mg supphes to Basra. To develop Koweit as a port it would be absolutely necessary to carry out such works as would enable sea-going steamers to he alongside a railway wharf to discharge and take in cargo ; and whether the port was made opposite the town of Koweit or 10 miles away in the Duhakathama, this would entail the construction of an elaborate system of harbour works, quay walls, warehouses, etc., the construction of which would cost a very large sum of money that might more profitably be expended on the' dredging of the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. I can understand in the past, when the air was full of political intrigue Koweit being regarded as a possible set-off to Basra, but with Basra a British possession, Koweit must necessarily sink into insignificance. M the head of the Gulf on the Shatt-el-Arab— (i) Mohammerah. • Trade. Mohammerah serves Ahwaz, Shushtar, Dizful and Ispahan along with the country between those towns. In 1910-11, 364 steam vessels of 828,000 tons called at the port, and the value of the imports and exports in 1913-14 was £812,000 (including plant of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company valued at £211,000) and £313,000, respectively. Communications.—Qj the Karun river to Ahwaz and thence by road to Shushtar and Dizful, or by the Lynch Road to Ispahan. An alternative route for Shushtar is to tranship at Ahwaz and continue by river to near the town. There is a proposal for a railway from Mohammerah to Ahwaz and Khoramabad, and for a motor road from Ahwaz to Ispahan. The Karun river leaves much to be desired from the navigation point of view, and can only be used by launches and other vessels of very shallow draught. Port Mohammerah is a port on the Shatt-el-Arab and all sea going vessels have to be limited to a draught of 21 feet, in order to cross the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab river and even that draught is only possible at high-water on spring tides. There is no port accommodation at Mohammerah and vessels lie in the river and conduct the trade with the shore by means of lighters, (ii) Basra. Trade. —The port is situated on the Shatt-el-Arab river near the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and is the principal port of Mesopotamia serving the whole of the country up to Baghdad and thence to Kerman- shah via Khanikin. In 1913-14, 190 vessels aggregating 321,668 tons entered the port; and the value of imports and exports was £3,899,000 and £1,939,000, respec tively. 080(w)AD18 Communications .—The main lines o£ communications are along the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. There is a railway to Nasiriyah, and railway communication will shortly be established with Baghdad. Port Facilities. —-In the days of the Turks, there were no port facilities, but wharves have now been built where vessels can lie alongside and discharge their cargoes at all states of the tide ; whilst there is mooring: accommodation in the river opposite Basra for 24 deep-sea steamers. Owing to the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab sea-going vessels proceed ing to Basra are limited to a draught of 21 feet at high-water on spring tides, but in a separate report I have indicated the measures to be taken to remove the bar, (3) Plan No. 2 accompanying this report shews the various ports in the Gulf with the trade routes and towns served by them, and on comparing the statements of their trade and advantages it will be apparent that even before the war Basra easily held the first place ; and considering its great natural advantages and possi bilities of future development, I think there can be no doubt that with the advent of peace and a progressive administration, Basra will in the near future become * the great port, of the Middle East. The port which will, in my opinion, come next to Basra is Bandar Abbas # where money could be spent with advantage on port improvements and communi cations ; tyut for Koweit and Bushire, I can see no future prospects,—on the contrary, with the development of Basra, they will probably lose a great deal o£ their present trade. TRADE PROSPECTS. (4) The Trade Commission have dealt fully with the prospects of British trade in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf , but it may be desirable to discuss the subject more particularly from the point of view of the Port of Basra. The statistics of trade in Mesopotamia and the Gulf are given in Mr. Lloyd's report dated 1908, and in the recent report of the Mesopotamian Trade Commission but I submit that statistics of trade in the past are almost valueless for the purpose of estimating the trade of the future, as astonishing developments may be expected at the conclusion of the war. On the assumption that, {a) Basra becomes a British Possession , (6) the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab will be removed ; (c) the ordinary port facilities found at any first-class port will be provided at Basra ; and that {d) improved communications will be given by river and railroad between Basra and Baghdad, and between Basra and Southern Persia : I have, after close study of the subject, formed the following conclusions {%) Basra will become the principal seaport not only of Mesopotamia but of Persia, and the main distributing centre for the bulk of the merchan dize imported by ocean vessels for the whole of Mesopotamia,—- Kermanshah via Baghdad, and Ispahan and Southern Persia via Ahwaz, and will also be the port of shipment for the greater part of the exports from Mesopotamia and Southern Persia. (ii) The Persian Gulf ports will probably be largely served by coasting, steamers from Basra rather than from Europe or India direct, as it will not pay for large deep draught vessels to stop at the small ports on their way to Basra. {Hi) There will be a great and rapid increase in the trade with India and the Far East, more especially as the industrial development of India progresses, and India will find in Mesopotamia and Persia a ready market for her surplus manufactured goods.© 19 {iv) There will be a large passenger trade between Basra and-ports in India. '{v) Tbe trade of tbe Port of Basra lias nothing to fear from railway competi tion via the Baghdad Railway and a port in the Mediterranean. (5) In forming these conclnsions, I would explain that I do not contemplate the rapid execution of vast irrigation schemes; on the contrary I believe it will be many years before even a comprehensive project for irrigation has been prepared under the new conditions and circumstances. I am also aware that the total population of Mesopotamia is only between 1 million and ij millions, or about 10 to the square mile, as compared with that of 45 to the square mile in Burma (one of the least populated provinces in India), nearly 540 to the square mile in Bengal and 1,000 to the square mile in Egypt, and I do not look to any very great increase in the immediate future. In the matter of immigration, the Trade Commission points out the difficulties of introducing Indian colonists or settlers. Unless, however, Indians are prohibited by legislation from entering the country, I do not see how their immigration m considerable numbers is to be stopped. They will come as shopkeepers, petty merchants, tradesmen, and, if required, as labourers to the Arab farmer. The province of Burma may be cited as a parallel case : the Burmans are a totally different race from the natives of India, they have a different religion, and, like the Arab they are disinclined to hard work and fond of luxuries. The Indian shop keeper has spread all over the country, and some 500,000 Indians enter the country by the Port of Rangoon, every year to reap the rice crop for the Burman proprietor, returning to their own country at the end of the season. (6) Whilst negativing the idea of any rapid development of the country on a large scale, I do hold the opinion strongly that with the advent of peace and a suitable administration there will be an impetus given to agriculture and to agricultural machinery, and that the existing systems of irrigation will be extended and improved. I also look to improved communications bringing a greatly increased trade with Baghdad and Kermanshah and the province of Arabistan, and in this I am influenced by the following statements which appear in the report and appendices of the Mesopotamian Trade Commission (1) ' The dominant influences affecting Baghdad trade are to be found in Basra—namely, in the ocean freights to that place, in the facilities for, or obstructions to, the import or export of merchandize at the port; and m the river freights obtainable from Basra to Baghdad.' (2) ' Great stress should be laid upon the working connexion which already exists between India and Mesopotamia. Bombay is felt throughout Iraq to be the nearest importan.t centre of commerce and civilization, and before the war the inhabitants of Basra used to regard Bombay and Baghdad as equidistant.' (3) ' The great bulk of the import trade was, before the war, transit business with Western Persia through Baghdad—the real centre of commercial interest. Basra was primarily the seaport of Baghdad, though its trade in dates and grain gave it an importance of its own, and the local market for piece goods, sugar, etc., was shewing signs of expan sion. Persian trade through Khanikin will continue to be of great importance in the future ; but if the agricultural regeneration of Mesopotamia takes place on the lines anticipated, the purchasing power of the people will be very largely increased and the demands for imports of all kinds will expand.'20 W 'Th, a, Bagtdad-Klianildn-KenDansIjal, £'1 60 T^ 7 1 ' ' M-W™. bl' e wai.

(8) On the assumption that my views as to the future of the Port of Basra are accepted, it may be presumed that one of the first acts of Government will be to establish the port on a proper basis and provide accommodation for the existing trade with provision for its future development. In the following chapters I will therefore make suggestions for the administration and equipment of the port. ADMINISTRATION. (9) In Port Administration three leading principles may be laid down : (i) the principles, sole object of a port administration is to benefit the community at large and the trade of the country, bearing in mind that business follows port facilities ; {ii) the authority controlling the port should be composed of men able to bring special commercial knowledge and sound judgment to bear on the many and diverse prob lems with which they have to deal, combined with a broad view of their respon sibilities and a recognition of the national as well as local interests frequently involved in the questions that come before them ; (in) no complete development can take place without ownership and control of the entire port area by one recog nised authority. The existence of rights and privileges by individuals or trading companies involving the creation of private ports within the port, has, in the past, been a fruitful source of trouble and has retarded the development of many of our principal ports. (10) Ports in the British Empire are usually controlled by one or other of the Methods of following methods : — Administration. (a) The municipality, as at Bristol. (h) Private or public companies, as at Manchester and, until recent years, London. (c) A railway company, as at Southampton, Cardiff, Heysham, andlmming- ham. (d) A public trust, as at Liverpool, Glasgow, Bombay, Calcutta, etc. Of the four methods, the latter is by far the most popular and the most satis factory, as the organization is largely in the hands of men who in their private businesses are intimately connected with the port and who take an interest and a pride in its management. Control by private or railway companies is, under certain conditions, success ful ; 'but management by a municipality is undesirable under any circumstances. The history of many ports in the British Empire begins with their control by a municipal committee, but the tendency of such bodies to regard the port merely as a contributor to municipal revenues and to use the funds in the interests of the town rather than the port, led to remonstrances on the part of the shipping com munity and finally the emancipation of the port from the town and the creation of a port trust. (11) I do not think that at Basra it would be expedient in the initial stages Proposal to of port development to form a port trust in the usual acceptance of the term, but ^ittee* * COm ' ,1 suggest that as soon as possible a port and river conservancy committee be C80(w)AD22 created as a department of Government and comprising a Chairman appointed by the Government, the Chief Collector of Customs, and two other officers of Govern ment as ea^officio members, and three gentlemen nominated by Government selected from the merchants, shipowrers and traders of the port. (12) The port should be defined as extending from Gurmat Ali where the Euphrates joins the Shatt-el-Arab (6 miles above Basra) to the lightship at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and on both banks of the river for 150 feet beyond high-water mark on ordinary spring tides. The committee would have the executive control and administration of the port and river, the appointment of officers and employees, and the control of funds within certain limits ; but its acts would be subject to the general control of Government. As the port grew and prospered the committee would be given increased powers, until finally the creation of a port trust administering the port under a port apt, would be indicated. WORKS AND EQUIPMENT. Requirements of a (13) The problem. o| port development necessitates, as a prehminary step, modern port. ^ s |- uc ^ 0 f ac tual local conditions of the port for which it is intended, but there are certain facilities and equipment that are essential for any first-class, port. These primary requirements are :— (i) Facility for prompt despatch of steamers. ( m ) Ample storage accommodation for goods. The first of these is largely dependent on the. extent of the second. The growth in the size of ships has been very great in the last 50 years, and the necessity for adequate port accommodation has increased proportionately. The greater the size of vessels, the more economically can they be run, owing to the fact that the consumption of fuel is pro rata less and the voyages, required fewer ; and it has been shewn that if the draught be increased proportionately to increase in other dimensions, the cargo can be carried at a steadily decreasing cost as size increases. In days gone by when ships were comparatively inexpensive, they were built to suit the ports which were comparatively costly. The situation is now reversed, and if the authorities at a port wish to secure or even hold trade, they must be prepared to march with the times and adapt their ports to the ships ; and the ports that are most efficient are those that have kept their facilities ahead of actual requirements. (14) What 'constitutes adequate facilities for the prompt despatch of steamers and storage of goods, is a question that every port must answer for itself, but for a river port it generally resolves itself into the following :— (1) A deep, well buoyed, and lighted channel extending from the sea to the entrance to the docks or wharves. (2) Sufficient deep-water wharf accommodation either inside the docks or alongside the river front. (3) An abundance of cranes and ample shed and warehouse room. (4) Railway connexions and, where there is inland navigation, facilities for transhipment to the river steamers when and where required. The rate of discharge from the ship is controlled by the ability to give clearance qp. sjiore, and the capacity of ships, has now become so great, that the accommodation. Definition of Port, and power of Committee, Adequate facilities.23 in the sheds and the ability of consignees to take delivery are taxed to their uttermost in endeavouring to keep pace with the actual discharging operations. The most general remedy is to build double-storey transit sheds or warehouses in the vicinity of the wharves, where goods can be stored and removed by consignees at their leisure, either to their own premises or to the railway goods stations. For export trade the operations are reversed or in some cases, as at Rangoon, it may be more suitable to load in mid-stream from barges than alongside a wharf. (15) It is absolutely essential that a port should possess ample foreshore accom- Poreshore modation. I have, during my professional career, seen nearly every port with aceommodatlon which I have been connected hampered because land—and especially foreshore land—had not been acquired for the port when it was available at a comparatively reasonable price. In Rangoon, the Port Commissioners had to raise loans amounting to several hundred thousand pounds to purchase land which could have been acquired for a few thousand pounds in the early days of the port; and the prosperity of the Bombay Port Trust is largely due to their foresight in acquiring land. I have already indicated to the Chief Political Officer, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D,' the land that in my judgment should be acquired for the purposes of the Port of Basra, and I have attached great importance to the acquisition of Messrs. Lynch Brothers' property and dock which is not only in the centre of the stretch of foreshore marked out for the new wharves, but owing to its projection into the river seriously interferes with the currents causing dangerous swirls and eddies. ■ (16) In the days of Turkish rule, although there was a certain amount of Accommodation at Basra the War. trade, there were no port facilities. All sea-going vessels lay at their anchors in at Basra before the stream, and imports for Basra were discharged into country boats and landed at the customs house, where goods for Baghdad were shipped into river steamers and fiats and taken up the river on a through bill of lading. Exports, consisting largely of dates, were collected in country boats at various points on the river and thereafter shipped into sea-going vessels. Under the conditions that existed, it is surprising that the volume of trade reached what it did, and the cost of freight, handling and carriage of piece goods and other imports by the time they reached Baghdad must have been considerably more than need have been the case.

With the development of trade, there will obviously be a demand first and fore most for deep-water wharves alongside which vessels can discharge their goods, and warehouses where they can be stored. Plan No. 1 accompanying this report phews the latest survey of the Shatt-el-Arab within the harbour area, from which it will be seen that the most suitable locality for deep-water wharves is at Margil, 5 miles above the Ashar Creek and the customs house. Here ij miles of deep-water frontage are available, and I have indicated in red lines on the plan a proposed24 Detailed require ments for csmmereial purposes. Other public works. arrarngement of wharves, warehouses, roads, etc. Owing to the absence of sea- worms in the Shatt-el-Arab, the wharves would be constructed entirely of teak timber which would be as lasting as steel or masonry but very much cheaper. The scheme is a progressive one and the first section of the wharf is completed,, but at the present time the new wharf and the whole of the deep-water frontage is taken up for military requirements, i.e., the Ordnance stores. Supply and Transport stores and warehouses, Eailway yard, and some of the docks, building-slips, stores and houses of the Inland Water Transport Department. Presumably, after the* conclusion of peace and when the port is being developed for commercial purposes, these departments will be moved elsewhere or the area occupied by them very muck curtailed in extent. Import Trade. (18) The bulk of the import trade will no doubt be accommodated at the new Margil wharves and the goods stored in the transit sheds at the back of the- wharves until customs and port dues have been paid, when they will be removed by the consignee. This procedure will obviate the necessity for a large customs house, but a building will be required for the storage of bonded goods. There will also be a certain quantity of imports destined for Persia and for local distribution which can be more conveniently dealt with by overside delivery from the steamer, and to this there can be no objection. Export Trade. The export trade will probably* take considerable time to develop to any great extent, and, in the first instance, all exports can be more easily and cheaply dealt with by lightering to the ocean vessels moored in the stream. In the future when the trade has increased and exports in large quantities are brought down by rail and river, the wharves can : be extended and goods loaded up direct from railway trucks on the land-side and river flats on the river-side. Inland Vessels' Trade. It will be many years before irrigation or railway competition interferes to any serious extent with the inland vessels' trade on the Tigris and Euphrates, and I propose to allocate for the river steamers the river-front below the deep-water wharves and to build a depot and provide floating pontoon landing stages. The water there is ample for river steamers but too shallow for sea-going vessels. Trade with Southern Persia. Whether the trade with Southern Persia is conducted by a railway from Basra to Ahwaz, as proposed by me, or continues via the Karun river, imports willy in the first instance, be conveyed to Basra in deep-sea ships and then be either transhipped to river steamer or put on to a railway wharf which would be built on the Persian side of the river. Miscellaneous private trades and industries. A number of private trades and industries are sure to spring up as the port develops, and I propose that the land between the inland vessels depot and the Ashar Creek be reserved for that purpose and rented to tenants. (19) In addition to the construction of the wharves and warehouses, swinging moorings, and, later on as they become necessary, a certain number of fixed moorings will be required for the use of vessels lying in the stream. At the present time? there is deep-water accommodation sufficient to provide swinging moorings for 2425 Vessels of 400 to 450 feet length and 25 to 30 feet draught, which will probably be sufficient for the port for many years to come. The following works which are partly municipal and partly portj should also be taken into consideration at an early date :—■ (a) The building of a good road along the whole river front. (b) The dredging of the Ashar and Khandak Creeks, and arrangements for their maintenance. (c) Reclamation of land on right bank of river along the whole harbour front and for a depth of 500 yards. FINANCE. (20) To construct a modern port with up-to-date facilities naturally requires Capital expendi- a large expenditure of funds, and the Royal Commission on the Port of London ture * when discussing the enormous strides made by Continental ports in the last few years, principally owing to lavish expenditure on the part of the State, remarked as follows ' The power of undertaking large present expenditure and of working for a long time at a loss with a view to compensation in a distant future, is no doubt in the keen world of competition, an advantage possessed by undertakings which have the force of an empire, state, or great city behind them. If, in some countries, national and municipal resources are thus employed, it becomes most difficult for private enterprise elsewhere to hold its own against the intelligent far-sighted and formid able rivalry thus created.' (21) It has not been the general policy, either in the United Kingdom or the Indian Empire, for the State to contribute directly to the construction of a com mercial port—preference being given to the creation of corporate bodies with func tions and powers granted by legislation ; but it is universally recognised that the interest on the capital cost of a port cannot in its earliest stages be wholly paid out of charges imposed, and that the State or other controlling power must, in the general welfare make up the difference from other sources. In the case under review, I submit that the first cost of the port works required in the immediate interests of trade should be met by a grant from the State, to be hereafter transferred to a port trust as part of the permanent debt. (22) Rates, dues and charges should be uncomplicated, easily collected, and Principle on levied so that there is an even distribution of taxation—no one industry or portion of the community being taxed to the benefit of another which pays nothing; they levied, should also be liable to as few alterations as possible. The main sources of revenue of a port are :— (а) tonnage dues on vessels, (б) rates on goods, subsidiary sources being, the hiring out of special appliances and conveniences, the warehousing of goods, and rents derived from port lands and buildings. The ratio of (a) to (h) varies at diSerent ports, but a fair average seems to be J part shipping to | parts goods. Tonnage dues on vessels are levied on the nett registered tonnage— i.e., the tonnage measurement when the various deductions have been made which are allowed by the Board of Trade for engine room space, accommodation for crew, etc. jC80(w)A.D.26 Eates on goods are levied on the ton weight of all goods conveyed on steamers either entering or leaving the port. Other sources of port revenue—such as rents from land and buildings, use of cranes, graving docks, machinery, etc., vary according to local circumstances in different ports. As a rule charges for special accommodation to vessels or goods should at least equal the expenditure on the part of the Port authority, but there are occasions when a graving dock or floating crane is worked at a loss because it is not sufficiently used to pay expenses, and yet the port would not be properly equipped without it and might indirectly suffer from the want of same. (23) The following is a list of rates and dues which may reasonably be expected to form the revenue of the Port of Basra, but under present conditions it is im practicable to suggest charges to meet each case. List of rates CHARGES ON VESSELS. and dues proposed / -x -n at Basra. {i) Fort dues. —A charge per ton on the nett registered tonnage of all vessels arriving in the port. {ii) Wharfage charges. —A charge either per registred ton or per day, for the use of the wharves and jetties. (m) Mooring hire and Harbour Masters' fees. —A charge per day or per registered ton on every vessel using a swinging mooring, and a fee on every occasion that a Harbour Master moves a vessel. {iv) Cargo hoat and passenger hoat licenses. —It is usual in every river port for cargo and passenger boats plying for hire to be registered and charged a fee for a license. DUES ON GOODS. W A- charge per ton on all goods arriving or departing on a sea-going vessel within the port. {ii) A charge for the use of the wharves and jetties when goods are either landed on or shipped from a wharf set aside for sea-going steamers. (Hi) Demurrage charges, ground rents and warehouse rents. INLAND VESSELS' TRADE. It is usual for the port authority to provide accommodation for river steamers and to charge an annual rent or tonnage charge for the use of the landing stages and goods-sheds, and also a small tonnage rate on all goods landed or shipped. LAND RENTS. A considerable revenue may be anticipated from port lands rented out to merchants and traders. CONCLUSION. (24) A new era will set in after the war, when the opportunities for British trade in Mesopotamia and Persia will be immeasurably increased. Port development has invariably been followed by increase of trade and population, and no time should be lost in making preparations at the Port of Basra for the trade that is bound to come at the termination of the war. There is a great deal of preliminary work to be done and I submit it would be the height of folly to defer action until the trade is clamouring for accommodation.27 28 follows 5 ?- 116 reCOmmendati0nS contained « thi 'eport may be summarised as W The creation at the earliest practicable date of a civil port authority, who will administer the port on the lines suggested in this report.

(iv) Although not directly within the scope of this report, it is recommend- ed m the general interests of trade, that the port of Bandar Abbas and neighbouring port of Bostaneh be examined, with a view to the increase of port facilities. (26) It may be of interest to point out the similarity between the Port of Rangoon in Burma and the Port of Basra in Mesopotamia, and, indeed, between the respective countries: Both are agricultural countries and inhabited by races distinct from those in India, and Mesopotamia is in very much the same condition to-day as was Upper Burma at the time of the annexation. Both Rangoon and Basra are river ports situated 39 and 67 miles, respectively, from the sea and served by rivers which traverse the entire length of the country, but Rangoon being on a river which is not a main branch of the Irrawaddy is saved from the bar at the mouth which so impedes the entrance to the Port of Basra, although Rangoon in other connexions has had to spend very large sums of money on river training and conservancy. In the progress made by the ports and their towns there is, however, little similarity, for whilst Basra remains a small town located in an unhealthy swamp and both in value of trade and shipping tonnage entering the port corresponds with Rangoon 50 years ago, Rangoon under the beneficent influence of 50 years of British rule has reclaimed its swamps and is now a city of 300,000 inhabitants, has developed a trade valued at £38,500,000, and has a shipping tonnage of 3 millions. It is worthy of note that the greatest increase in the value of the trade of Rangoon, i.e., between 1900 and 1912 coincided with the period when most money was being expended on port development and facilities, and is, I submit, a useful indication of what may be expected at Basra when the bar at the mouth of the Shatt- el-Arab has been removed and a well-equipped port created. GEORGE C. BUCHANAN. Simla ; The SOth June 1917.29 APPENDIX. A brief note on the future development of the Port of Basra and its communica* tions by land and water, by Sir George Buchanan, Kt., C.I.E., Director of Port Administration and Conservancy, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D. 5 ' 1. On the assumption that Mesopotamia will become a British possession at the close of the war, and that British relations with Arabistan will be strengthened and extended, it does not require much imagination to foresee a great future for the Port of Basra. In this note, I will describe the port as it exists and outline my suggestions for the future. 2. The Fort of .Sasm.—Basra is situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el- Arab river, 70 miles from the Outer Bar Lightship, and is distant from neighbour ing ports and towns as follows :■— Miles. Bombay .. .. .. .. .. .. ^573 Karachi .. .. .. .. .. .. i } i60 Port Said .. .. .. .. .. ., 1,951 Baghdad (by river) .. .. .. .. .. 502 Baghdad (by rail) .. .. .. .. .. 360 Mohammerah (by river) - .. .. .. .. .. 17 Ahwaz {via Mohammerah by river) .. .. .. .. 110 Ahwaz (in a direct line) .. .. .. .. .. 75 3. In the days of Turkish rule, although the trade was considerable, port accommodation was practically non-existent. All sea-going vessels laid at their anchors in the stream, and imports for Basra were discharged into country boats and landed at the custom house wharves, where imports for Baghdad were dis charged into river steamers and flats and taken up the river on a through bill of lading. Exports consisting largely of dates were shipped into country boats at various points on river, and thereafter conveyed to and loaded into the sea-going vessels There were no wharves; and even in the busy season the number of sea-going vessels in the port, at the same time, rarely exceeded half a dozen. The British occupation has already brought about a great change in the former state of affairs, and, as will be seen later, there is nothing to prevent Basra being made into one of the best equipped ports in the world. 4. Communications with the Port of Basra. —The following constitute the main avenues of approach to the Port of Basra, by land and water ;•— (i) The river Shatt-el-Arab, from other ocean ports. (ii) The Karun river, from Ahwaz and Southern Persia. (Hi) The river Tigris, from Baghdad and surrounding country. (iv) The river Euphrates, from Nasiriyah, Suk-esh-Sheyukh, and Samawah. [v] From Nasiriyah, by railway and various caravan tracks from Zobier and villages in the desert. I will now describe these various routes, and will preface my remarks by pointing out that in the days of Turkish rule practically nothing was done in any C80(w)AD30 way to assist navigation or trade, indeed, attempts to improve navigable waterways were discouraged if not prohibited. Under tbese circumstances, tbere are no past improvements or attempts at improvement to comment upon, and tlie wliole subject has to be dealt with ah initio. 5. The SJiatt-el-Arab. —The Shatt-el-Arabriver is formed by the junction of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates above Basra, and with the exception of the Outer Bar, and in a minor degree, the Mohammerah Bar, and an obstruction to the channel above Mohammerah caused by the sinking of the steamer ' Ekbatana ' by th© Turks, the river from Basra to the Gulf presents no difficulties to navigation. The channel is wide with a depth at lowrwater on spring tides of 30 to 40 feet, and there are no awkward bends or turns. The Outer Bar is a serious obstruction. It is 25,000 feet broad, composed of fine sand and silt and limits the draught of vessels entering the port to a maximum of 20 feet and that only at spring tides. 6. The Kamn river. —The Karun river joins the Shatt-el-Arab at Moham merah and is navigable for river craft as far as the town of Ahwaz, 110 miles by river from Mohammerah. At Ahwaz navigation is stopped by extensive rapids, ^ut above the rapids there is sufficient water for very shallow draught vessels for a further distance of 82 miles—that is to say within 10 miles of the town of Shushtar. On the lower river there is an abundance of water during the flood season, extending from April to July, but in the winter which is the season when there the greatest amount of traffic, the river is very low and vessels of 3 feet draught are sometimes unable to reach Ahwaz. 7. The Tigris river. —The river Tigris, once one of the main avenues for the world's commerce, has, through the systematic abstraction, for hundreds of years, of its waters for canals and irrigation ditches, deteriorated to such an extent that its very existence as a river is threatened ; and although during the high-water season there is abundance of water, during the low-water season navigation is limited to vessels of 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet 6 inches draught. There are, also, numerous awkward bends and shoal patches encountered throughout the route. 8. The Euphrates river. —The above remarks apply equally to the Euphrates, which although formerly a good navigable river from Samawah to Kurna has, since the bursting of its banks between Sukresh-Sheyukh and Chabaish, practically ceased to exist as a river between these points, and in winter months has some times less than a foot of wa,ter. 9. Land Routes. —There is now a railway to Nasiriyah, forming the first Section of the Basra-Baghdad Eailway, which will certainly be completed at an early date. Proposals for improvements, 10. The Port of Basra. —As already stated, at the time of the British occupa tion, port accommodation as generally known was non-existent, but considerable progress has already been made in this matter. At Margil, five miles above the Turkish customs house, there is a long strip of foreshore with deep water close to the bank, and this site has been selected for the wharves and warehouses for the future port.31 One permanent wkarf S00 feet long has already been constructed, and n second wharf 630 feet long is in the course of construction ; whilst the complete scheme contemplates 2 miles of continuous deep-water wharves equipped with cranes, transit sheds, and warehouses and having direct connexion with the Baghdad and other lines of railway, which will have their termini at this spot. Other improvements under consideration are the laying down of permanent moorings for ocean-going vessels, land reclamation along the river front, and the establishment of a river steamer depot below the ocean-going wharves. Communications with the Port of Basra. 11. With other Ocean The bars at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab and below Mohammerah, must be removed; the wreck of the ' Ekbatana ' blown up ; and a navigable channel, adequately bnoyed, marked, and lighted. None of these present any great engineering difficulties. With regard to the Outer Bar, detailed surveys are in hand and a certain amount of experimental dredging has been carried out. The question is chiefly one of dredging with powerful dredgers of a suitable type, and when these are made available, the cutting of a channel through the bar and its maintenance to a depth of 25, 26 or 27 feet below high-water on spring tides, as may be found necessary, can be done at a comparatively moderate cost, and a 24-feet channel cut within 6 to 9 months of date of commencing operations. The keeping down of the Mohammerah Bar, and the blowing up of the wreck of the ' Ekbatana,' are matters of easy accomplishment. In respect to the buoying, lighting and marking of the river, an accurate marine survey from Basra to the sea is well in hand, and once that is finished, the buoys can be laid down and leading marks established on shore. When all the works cited above are completed, the river will be so easy to navigate that I do not think compulsory pilotage will be necessary, although a certain number of pilots will have to be available to bring up vessels whose masters do not know the river and do not care to come up without guidance. 12. With Arabistan and Southern Persia. —The Karun, which is the only navigable river in Persia, was opened to the mercantile marine of the world in the year 1889, and great trade developments with Persia were anticipated, which unfortunately have not been realised ; the causes tare obvious, some of them being —the lack of port facilities at Mohammerah, the difficulties of river navigation, and the want of communications between Ahwaz and other towns in the interior. I have examined the river very carefully and studied all the information available on the subject, and, except at prohibitive cost, I am of opinion that the river is not capable of material improvement for navigation purposes ; moreover, in the low-water season, the water could be much more profitably used for irrigation purposes. I examined with interest the remains of many old irrigation works, and can see no reason against their restoration and the cultivation to a high degree of the very rich plains of Arabistan. The question of a railway from Ahwaz to Mohammerah has, I understand, been discussed ; and as when Mesopotamia was in the hands of the Turks the Port of Mohammerah formed our only means of communication, whether by river or rail, with Ahwaz, the subject was one of some importance, but with Basra a British Possession, I submit the conditions have entirely changed.32 13. In my judgment, the proper course to pursue is to abandon Moham- merah. as a port, and to centralise at Basra, making Basra the great ocean port of Mesopotamia and Southern Persia. I propose the building of a railway in a straight line from Basra to Ahwaz, a distance of about 75 miles through flat country ; and at Basra I would have- a railway depot, wharves and warehouses. A scheme is at present under consideration for a motor road between Ahwaz and Ispahan, and if this were carried out and a railway made to Ahwaz, Basra would become the great distributing centre for the bulk of the trade of Southern Persia. There would also be a very considerable passenger traffic by the railway and trade with Persia would undoubtedly be immensely strengthened and facili tated. Imports from overseas would come direct to Basra in deep-sea ships, and would be railed to their destination • whilst, when, by means of irrigation, the country had been so developed as to have surplus produce for disposal, it could be conveyed direct by rail to Basra, and, as at Karachi, put direct on to sea going ships. 14. In the general interests of trade and port administration, such a scheme would be highly beneficial. Smaller subsidiary ports such as Mohammerah are never satisfactory, either t0' merchant or shipowner, and the concentration of the whole of the trade at the well-equipped Port of Basra would, i am convinced, be beneficial to all con cerned. I am well aware of the arguments in favour of water transport and if the Karun had its outlet at Basra instead of at Mohammerah, I should advocate the use of both river and railway, using the former for the export trade when the state of the river permitted. Each case must, however, be dealt with on its merits, and not on a hard and fast rule ; and in this particular case, I believe a careful examination of the pros and. cons will show a large balance in favour of the railway and the concentration of trade at Basra. 15. With Baghdad and surrounding country,—In the near future, Baghdad will probably be connected, by railway to Basra ; but in this case a combination of a railway service with a river service is most desirable. The river Tigris can be greatly improved for navigation purposes, and I am of the opinion that it will be so used for very many years and. that large, areas of. the country can be irrigated, without necessarily interfering with navigation. 16. With Nasiriyah and surrounding country.—Wj remarks as to the improve ment of the Tigris for navigation apply also to the Euphrates, where a project is already under execution for restoring the old bed of the Euphrates between Kurna and Suk-esh-Sheyukh, and. when this is completed vessels drawing 5 to' 6 feet can ply between Basra, Nasiriyah and Samawah at all times of the year. 17. The above is an outline of my proposals after 15 months close study of the' situation, but reports in greater detail are in hand under the- following heads : - (a) The improvements on the Shatt-el-Arab river including the removal of the Outer Bar. (b) Improvements for navigation purposes on the Tigris and Euphrates^ with notes on Flood- Control and Irrigation.33 (c) Tlie development of Arabistan and tlie establishment of direct com- munication between Ahwaz and Basra. (d) Construction of wharves and general equipment of the Port of Basra on the lines of a modern port. (e) Proposals for the administration of the Port of Basra and conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab river, along with suggestions for the levying of rates and dues on vessels and goods according to the recognised methods and standards adopted in British ports.
