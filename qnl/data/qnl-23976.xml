Jones writes that Shaikh Sultan has complained about his treatment by the British in relation to the slave trade. Following Jones’s letter is the translation of a letter (folio 215) from Shaikh Sultan to Jones, dated 24 July 1856, in which the complaints are made, with the suggestion that the slave trade exists elsewhere in the ports of the Arabian peninsula as well. A translation of Jones’s reply to Shaikh Sultan (folio 216), dated 16 August 1856, includes Jones’s rejection of Shaikh Sultan’s complaints, with the suggestion that the Shaikh attend to the presence of slaves in his own ports and bazaars.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024066926.0x000051#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
