Sir, With reference to the telegram of the Idth instant, No. 379, from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, regarding Abu Musa Island, I am directed to say that Mr. Secretary Morley concurs in the terms of the telegram of instructions which the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs proposes to send in reply. As regards the question of policy involved, Mr. Morley considers it of importance that the controversy, which may perhaps be inevitable with the German Government, should as far as possible be minimised. He would sug gest that it should be made clear to Germany at the earliest convenient occa sion that the action taken by His Majesty's Government has been solely with a view to maintaining the Sheikh's authority, which we have recognised by treaty agreements with him, and not with any object of excluding foreign enterprise,—a course that would be inconsistent with that principle of the ' open door ,, on which the whole policy of His Majesty's Government in these regions is based. The proceedings of the single concessionaire who, independently of his other partners in the concession, executed the contract with Messrs. Wonckhaus, were of a kind fully to justify the Sheikh in cancelling the concession with a view to the maintenance of his authority. Germany might further be in formed that when the questions connected with the cancellation have been settled, there will be no objection on the part of His Majesty's Government to the Sheikh making suitable arrangements for the exploitation of the oxide, provided that he grants no monopoly. With reference to the advice given to the Sheikh by the Eesident at the request of the Charge d'Affaires—advice marked by a slightly undiplomatic crudity of expression—to pay no attention to the representations of the German Consul-General, Mr. Morley, in order to anticipate any complaint by the German authorities of improper behaviour on the part of the Sheikh, would suggest that it should be explained that the reason of the Sheikh's silence is that he has been informed by the British authorities that in accordance with the provisions of our treaty engagements with him, the matter will be discussed by us on his behalf with the German authorities.

No. 202 (Telegraphic). 18th December 1907. Please refer to your telegram No. 379 regarding Abu Musa red oxide concession. Tour action is approved, and you should make communication to the German Minister as proposed, pointing out that, apart from Treaty rights, action of British subject, Hassan Samaiyeh, in making contract with Wonckhaus was illegal and fraudulent, because Hassan had no authority from his third partner, who strongly objected to the Wonckhaus contract. You should draw Minister's attention to the fact that the Sheikh of Shargah has been under our protection since the conclusion of the Treaty of 1820 and Treaty of 1892 was published for general information. /Telegram, dated the 7th January 1908. jr rom —His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To— His Majesty's Secretary o£ State for India, London, via Suez. My telegram dated January 6th. Abu Musa. Resident considers that proper course for the aggrieved party to follow would be to institute a suit in the Residency Court or at any rate refer matter to Resident. We concur in this. Wonckhaus and also both concessionaires, who are naturalised British subjects, are well aware that the Sheikh of Sharga is under the Resident's political iurisdiction. Wonckhaus himself, in a^ somewhat similar case in Bahrein in 1905, invoked the assistance of the Resident. His departure in this instance from ordinary procedure and previous precedent appears to indicate some ulterior motive from the outset. (See our telegram to Minister, Tehran, No. 12 -C., dated November 17th.) We trusted that the case would be discussed in London with German Ambassa dor since we anticipated that, otherwise, the German Minister at Tehran might instigate a revival of the Persian claims to the island. Our expectation as to this has now been fulfilled {vide Marling's telegram to Foreign Office, No. 6, dated January 6th), and it seems particularly desii-able therefore that further discussion of the case at Tehran should if possible be stopped. We would venture to recommend if incident is likely to be further pro tracted that Marling should inform German Minister that the Truc-ial Chiefs are under the jurisdiction of the Resident and that complaints of their proceedings should at any rate in the first instance be preferred to him. The fact that Wonckhaus' agent has endeavoured to dpal direct with Sheikh in matter, and has throughout made no reference to Persian Government, should render it difficult for Germans to press for Persian interference at this stage. We attach great importance to maintenance of Resident's authority and jurisdiction over Tmcial Chiefs. He is not under the Minister at Tehran in regard to them. Finally facts of case are well known at Bushire where Brown has assistance of German Consul. i: wii arr tli( onTelegram, dated the 8th January 1908.

Instmctions have been issued to Major Cox in accordance with your telegram, dated January 6th. He had already been authorised to arrange for removal of accumulated oxide—see my telegram of October 29th. May Cox be informed, with reference to his telegram of January 3rd, that there is no objection to gun-boat re-visiting island during removal of oxide ? This would prevent Germans attempting to make a permanent lodgment on island on pretext of removing accumulated ore and it would also obviate possibility of friction with Sheikh's men.Uo Telegram, dated the 9th January 1908. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, via Suez. This is in continuation of my telegram of January 8th. Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf reports that Sheikh of Sharga has failed to main tain guards effectively on island owing to apathy and disinclination to incur expense. He suggests either that we should buy or lease island from Sheikh by secret document or that, with view to maintenance of guard, we should subsidise third concessionaire, Esa bin Abdul Latif, who is incensed at conduct of his co-partner. If Sheikh consents, Esa bin Abdul Latif would undertake to live on island with guard and represent Sheikh's interests. We mi^ht privately supply the funds for the guard. We hesitate to suggest any move- ment at present which might throw doubt upon the correct nature of our proceedings, and though we think that something might be made of Esa, the partner not concerned in the monopoly granted to Wonckhaus, we would prefer to leave matters as they are until things settle down, only taking measures by deputation of a gun-boat to secure that forcible possession of the island is not taken either by the Persian Government or Wonekhaus, or the conces sionaires. In view of position of island and recent stranding of steamer Balirnba there it might be as well for us to place a lighthouse on the island later on. This would probably be sufficient to protect the interests of ourselves and the Sheikh. We are still of opinion that when the incident is closed arrangements should be made to sell the ore freelv and without special monopoly or concession to anyone. /I r G. I. C. P, 0.—No. 4326 P.

On receipt of this letter, we cabled to our Busreh Manager, Mr. Chistopher Darby, instructing him to hold himself in readiness to proceed at an early date to Sharga, with a view to making a contract with the Sheikh of Shargah foi the output of the Oxide mined at Abu Musa. Mr. Darby cabled in reply that he was ready to proceed to Shargah by our Steamship Luristan leaving Basrah in a few days, but, before giving him definite instructions to go, we should like to know whether the Govern ment of India would prefer our postponing his visit to Sbarga, until a more opportune time, in view of the fact that, in to-day's '' Standard, an incident is reported to have taken place recently at the Island of Abu Musa. Although the ' Standard ' report gives a different version of the incident to that given by our Agent, Haji Hussein Gelladary, yet in a way, it tends to confirm the fact that some such incident has taken place. Of course should Mr. Darby proceed to Sharga, and succeed in making a contract with the Sheikh of that place for the output of Oxide from Abu Musa, we should not take any steps under any such contract until we had the authority of the Government of India to do so, as promised in our letter of 22nd August last. With regard to the Oxide mined at the Island of Ormuz, we have received no further advances towards making a new contract from either the Mouin-ut-Tujar or his English Agents, Messrs. Ellinger &amp; Company of Man chester, although, in previous years, the contract tor the succeeding year has generally been completed during the months of October and November. If, by any chance, the Mouin-ut-Tujar has made a contract with the Germans, or the Belgians, for the output of his Oxide from Ormuz, we shall be all the more anxious to secure the contract for the output of Oxide from the Island of Abu Musa.

Dear Sirs, I am in receipt of your favour of the 18th ultimo, and can give you the following information regarding Abu Musa Oxide which will of course interest you. About ten years ago four persons wz., Haji Nakhoda Ally 3 Haji Hussau Bui Ali Sumaya, his son Abdulla and Isa Abdul Latiff, obtained the lease of the Island of Abu Musa from the Sheikh of Sharga (Oman) for the yearly rental of only 250 Hehals (about Rs, 360). They say there was a condition that the Ore was to be sold only to England or its dependencies. Up to now about 10,000 tons have gone to India in Native Crafts. On the death of Haji Nakhoda Ally, Haji Hussan Sumaya got the upper hand in the matter and without consulting the other partners made a contract with Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., to sell this Oxide only to them and about ],0S0 tons have been taken up by the German boats since then, of which the last Steamer Sentonia had 500 tons. Assyria also would have taken up a quantity, but in the meanwhile something unexpected happened which has put a stop to the export of Oxide from Abu Musa at least for the present. On 23rd October our British Consul Captain Gabriel went to Sharga in H. M. S. Lapwing and from there sailed for Abu Musa in company of the Sheikh of Sharga. There the Sheikh went on shore with a number of his own soldiers and at once cleared away all men and coolies concerned in this business with all their stores and placed a guard to prohibit anyone from entering the Island. It is said that this step was taken as the above named condition of the contract was not strictly observed by the lessee. There still lies a great quantity of the good quality Ore taken up by the Sentonia. It is dug out from the centre of the Island, and the place is known by the name of Maidan. Nearly 2,000 tons of this stuff lying ready for export. I will try and send you samples of some and also let you know any fresh developments in the case. The Assyria (Hamburg American Line) arrived here yesterday and took up 130 packages from here of w 7 hich 43 bags poppy seeds were for Hamburg, 10 Pistas for Suez, 56 Gum for London and 30 Gum for Odessa. She had no pilgrims on board. Yours faithfully, S. DOEABJEE, for Haji Russain Gelladary. (Received, on 6th January 1908, with Political Secretary's letter No. 51, dated the 20th December 1907.)

Ends, arranged to himXtedtea 0 ™ • Ianuarywas rel,eated t0 Ma J 0r Cox message11 As you are aware the circumstances whicli liave resulted in the present juncture were briefly as follows ;— In the summer of 1898 the Sheikh of Sliargah went on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and during his absence his uncle, who was acting as Regent, granted a lease of the mines in question to three persons, viz., Hassan Samaiyeh (a British Indian subject), his son Abdulla, and Esa bin Abdul Latif (the son of the British Residency Agent at Shargah), for such a period as they might wish to hold the mines, provided they paid two hundred and fifty dollars per annum. On the Sheikh of Shargah's return from Mecca he evidently claimed to become a partner in the concern, and was admitted as such by the others ; but a few months later he transferred his interest in it to one Yusuf bin Abdullah, who, again, was eventually bought out by Hassan Samaiyeh in December 1900. In the beginning of 1905 it was found necessary, on considerations of general policy, for the Resident in the Persian Gulf to warn the Sheikh of Sharirah and his uncle. Sheikh Salem, against entering into any ill-considered agreement with the German firm of Wonckhaus and Company for leasing the red oxide mines. The two Sheikhs gave assurances that they would do nothing without the knowledge of the British Resident. On 1st June 1906, however, an agreement was executed at Lingah, by which Hassan Saroaiyeh, claiming to act not only for himself but also for his two partners, gave to Mr. Robert Wonckhaus a specific monopoly of the output for four years, with a preferential option to renew at the end of that period. The terms of this agreement were such as to afford a considerable margin of profit on the original concession. On learning some months later of this transaction, Esa bin Abdul Latif, the junior partner of the three original concessionaires, lodged a protest with the Sheikh of Shargah, petitioning that the contract with Mr. Wonckhaus might be annulled. Accordingly, in a letter dated the 21st February 1907, the Sheikh of Shargah informed Hassan Samaiyeh of this complaint: he added that he had no right to grant a monopoly to third parties without making any reference tx) the Territorial Ruler, and that the continuance of the concession in Hassan's hands was undesirable, and that the original contract had therefore been terminated. On 28th August the Government of India telegraphed that Hassan Samaiyeh had reinforced his miners and refused to stop working, and that the Sheikh of Shargah considered force would be necessary to oust him from the island. On the 10th October, a formal notice from the Sheikh of Shargah was handed to Hassan Samaiyeh, calling upon him to cease forthwith from his mining operations, and to remove himself, and his workmen, machinery and all instruments from the island of Abu Musa within ten days. This notice was accompanied by a verbal communication from the British Resident's representa tive, to the effect that if he failed to comply with the Sheikh's demands, the Sheikh would have the approval of His Majesty's Government in ejecting him, and would be supported in such forcible action as might be required. On 20th October H. M. 8. Lapwing sailed for Abu Musa, towing four bungalows containing a force of the Sheikh of Shargah's armed retainers. The officer in command of this force was warned (against the use of unnecessary force and H. M. S, Lapwing lay by to guard against such a contingency. The miners consented at once to leave, which they did, together with their effects, on the 22nd October. On the same day, Mr. Brown, the Agent of Mr. Wonckhaus, sailed for Abu Musa accompanied by 26 men : but on the 25th October the party returned to Lingah, having been refused permission to land by the Sheikhs guard, who appear to have behaved with resolution. It may be observed incidentally that H. M. S, Lapwing had sailed before the arrival of Mr. Brown. 4778 P. DIt appears to Sir E. Grey that the best course to take is for His Majesty 's Government to treat the case as far as possible as a commercial dispute between the parties, and to keep the political aspects out of the discussion- from the legal point of view the case is undoubtedly strongest so long as it ij regarded and dealt with as a commercial dispute. The present position would appear to be as follows :— Hassan Samaiyeh has made a contract with Mr. Wonckhaus, which he has either already broken or is no longer in a position to carry out; he is con sequently liable to them {sic) in damages. Hassan is a British subject and an action can, therefore, be brought against him in a British Court. If the facts were gone into in a Court of Law it might not improbably transpire that Mr. Wonckhaus was aware that Hassan had partners and had no authority to make the contract without them. If the German authorities were to retort, when invited to bring an action that it would be absurd to sue Hassan as he is a man of no substance, and also because their real ground of complaint is that the Sultan's cancellation of the original lease has rendered it impossible for Hassan to fulfil his contract though he himself is ready and willing to do so, it appears to Sir E. Grey that the Sheikh of Shargah was fully entitled to cancel the lease whenever he wished to do so, since tbe lease was no more than a permit to work these mines, determin able by notice on either side, the owner receiving 250 dollars a year so lon^ as it was in force. The phrase that 'I . . . .let on lease all the ... mines . for such a period as they may wish to hold them . . ' does not, Sir E. Grey is advised, indicate that the owner is bound for ever and can under no circumstances escape from his contract, however valuable the mines may become ; it merely reserves to the partners the right to give up the mines and escape from the liability to pay 250 dollars a year when they please. That the owner retainei the risrht to cancel contracts of this kind is shown by the penultimate paragraph of the agreement, to wit:—'I have perhaps made out certain agreements previous to this. They do not hold good and this agree ment is to be acted on.' If the owner possessed the right to cancel the agreement when he pleased, the circumstances of the contract between Hassan and Mr. Wonckhaus justified the exercise of such a discretion. It was made without the conseut of one of the partners who subsequently complained to the Sheikh, and it gave Mr. \V onckhaus a monopoly of the Abu Musa oxide, thus infringing the policy which the Trucial Chiefs have consistently followed under the advice ol His Majesty's Government whose desire is that all trade should be open and free. If the German Government argue that the legality of the Sheikh's action ^ouhi be a very suitable matter to refer to arbitration, it appears to Sir Jb. Grey that Ilis Majesty's Government would be justified in declining upon u le ground that the primary cause of Mr. Wonckhaus' loss is not the action of |ie olreikh but the tailure of Hassan Samaiveh to carry out his contract, and that until Mr. Wonckhaus has tried and failed to recover damages from him c . ( 10 c 1 an L1 no :ile 6^ for the German Government to approach the Sheikh of Shargah through His Majesty's Government as to arbitration. lurning now to the decision which may be laid down in a Court of Law, i appears o Su E, Grey that if Hassan's contract with Mr. Wonckhans is K.nf a i void on the ground that his partner was not a party to it, the position or!®- ^ G ° m P a,a * lve ty simple. Mr. Wonckhaus will have a claim for damages n^ii! nS * 10 . 0 e! ^ an ^ : ^ if appears that he obtained the contract by any ^ Partner, this claim will be a weak one. If, on the other ™tPfl i t tl3e .i unior partner only objected because he was insti- unon ITk M?' the elaim wouhi be a strong one, and it would be incumbent not ho nnn ^ 0S ' S ornmei1 ^ consider whether some compensation should not be paid as an act of grace from Government funds to settle the matter.13 If it should prove, however, that Hassans contract is not tendered void on this or any other ground, the position will be that he has failed to fulfil it because his concession was cancelled. It would then be necessary for His Majesty's Government to uphold the Sheikh's right to cancel tlie concession on the grounds already indicated* But in view of the looseness of the wording of the original concession, Messrs* Wonckhaus and Hassan Samaiyeh may fairly urge that a peremptory termina tion without notice was a hardship ; and in this case it would be a considera tion whether some compensation should be paid to Mr. Wonckhaus, or whether some condition should be attached to any new concession which may be granted to third parties, Under which Mr. Wonckhaus should be allowed to purchase up to a given quantity of red oxide, at the price fixed with Hassan Samaiyeb, for a limited period. I am to revert to the future granting of concessions on the island in a subsequent paragraph. Sir E. Grey does not think that the Treaty of 1892 should be relied on or brought into the case at alL It might perhaps be argued that the lease to Hassan Samaiyeh and his partners amounted to a ' giving for occupation' of part of the Sheikh's territory within Article 111 of the Treaty ; be this as it may, it is clear that the contract between Hassan and Mr. vVonckhaus was not. If^ therefore, His Majesty's Government were to depend upon the terms of the Treaty, they would be driven to argue that the owner's action in leasing these mines to three men all entitled to British protection was a violation of the Treaty though it had taken place nine years before and they had had cognizance of the concession for its whole duration. It would further be necessary to argue that the Treaty prevented the Sheikh from leasing territory even to his ow r n subjects, as the British contention would have to be that any 'selling, etc.,' except to His Majesty's Government was prohibited. The only other incident which the German Government are likely to raise is the refusal of the Sheikh's men to allow Mr. Wonckhaus' agent to land to look after the oxide on the island ready for shipment* To this it may be replied that the property in question is quite safe and that there was no need for Mr. Wonckhaus to send guards to look after it, and that they are at liberty to take it away when they please. Turning now to the future disposal of any concession for working the mines in the island of Abu Musa, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that, if the question of monopolies and the open door is raised'His Majesty's Government might inform the German Government that there is no objection to Mr. Wonckhaus trading in red oxide, but only to his having a monopoly ; and some arrangement for supplying this merchant with a certain amount of oxide might be come to on the basis already suggested. Sir E. Grey considers that if a hond fide British firm, which he assumes Messrs. Strick to be, were to secure the new concession such an arrangement would be safe as well as equitable: while in view of the fact that His Majesty's Government are debarred from assisting British trade by means of subsidies and other similar devices to compete against German State-aided enterprise, it appears eminently desirable to take advantage of the special position acquired by His Majesty's Government in their relations with the Trucial Chiefs, and not to let any opportunity slip of securing British trade interests against the formidable efforts which, in the early future, may not improbably be made to reduce our existing commercial supremacy in the Persian Gulf. Although Sir E. Grey considers that it would not be advisable to go so far as to grant a definite new concession to Messrs. Strick for the present, he thinks that they should be informed that as prior applicants they shall have the first offer of a new concession so far as His Majesty's Government can effect this, and that His Majesty's Government would be glad to learn that they would be prepared to entertain such an offer ; but that lor the moment certain matters are under investigation and until they have been considered no new concession can be granted.&gt;/■ 14 4 I Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn the views of Mr. Morley upon the considerations set forth in this letter ; and he considers that the terms of the new concession might advantageously receive immediate attention.

Sir, In continuation of the papers inclosed in the letter from this Office of the 15th June last regarding the Abu Musa Eed Oxide Concession, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to forward herewith, for submission to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Government of India reporting their proceedings in the matter, and stating their views as to the course which should be followed. Sir E. Grey will observe that the Concession under which certain Arabs had granted a lease amounting to a monopoly to Herr Wonckhaus has been cancelled by the Sheikh of Shargah, and that to aviod misconceptions which might arise if the rights enjoyed by Herr Wonckhaus should be at once trans ferred to Messrs. Strick, that firm have been asked through their local agents to defer any action with regard to the Abu Musa mines lor the present. As regards future arrangements, it will be seen that the Government of India think that the Sheikh should not be allowed to grant any monopoly, and that he should be advised to submit to the Folitical Hesident the draft of any new contract into which he may propose to enter. Subject to Sir E. Grey 's concurrence, Mr. Morley proposes to approve the action proposed by the Government of India, and to request them not to sanction any Concession which the Sheikh may propose to grant without reporting the matter home, with reference to any change that may have occurred in the local circumstances, and any representations that may have been received from Herr Wonckhaus. Messrs. Strick may at the same time be requested, as suggested by the Government of India, to postpone, at any rate until the end of the current year, action under any contract they may contemplate negotiating with the Sheikh for oxide from the Abu Musa 'mines. I am, etc.,Received on the 20th January 1908, with 'Political Secretary's letter No. 1, dated the 3rd January 1908. CONFIDENTIAL. (9074.) MEMORANDUM ON THE RED OXIDE CONCESSION ON THE ISLAND OP ' ABU MUSA. [Amended Version.] The Sheikh of Shargah is one of the Tmcial Chiefs who are under the protection of His Majesty's Government. Treaty relations have long subsisted between these Chiefs, who inhabit the so-called Pirate Coast on the Arabian iitoral of the Persian Gulf, and Great Britain. Former Treaties were confirmed by that concluded in March 1892, and ratified by Lord Lansdowne as Viceroy of India, which stipulates that the Sheikh shall on no account (1) enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; (2) consent, without the per mission of the British Government, to the resident within his territory of the Agent of any other Government; and (3) cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of bis territory, save to the British Government. This Treaty was published for general information. In the summer of 1898 the Sheikh of Shargah went on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and during his absence his uncle, who was acting as Regent, granted a lease of the red oxide mines of Abu Musa to three persons ; viz., a naturalized British-Indian subject, his son, and the son of the British Residency Agent at Shargah. The concession was expressly granted ' for such a period as they might wish to hold the mines, provided they paid 250 dollars per annum, ' and included landing rights if it should prove desirable to engage in oyster fisheries. On the Sheikh of Shargah's return from Mecca he evidently claimed to become a partner in the concern, and was admitted as such by the others; but a few months later he transferred his interests in it to one Yusuf bin Abdullah, who, again, was eventually bought out bv Hassan Samaiyeh in December 1900. In the beginning of 1905 it was found necessary for the Eesident in the Persian Gulf to ask the Residency Agent on the Arab Coast to warn the Chief of Shargah and his uncle. Sheikh Salem, against entering into any ill-considered agreement with Messrs. Wonckhaus for leasing the red oxide mines on Abu Musa. The two Sheikhs assured the Agent that they would do nothing without the knowledge of the British Resident. Messrs. TV onckhaus, who, it may be stated [parenthetically) are the agents^ • in the Persian Gulf of the Hamburg-American Line, fiffaing themselv^ debarred from securing a direct Concession from the Chief of Shargah, then had recourse to devious methods. On the 1st June, 1905, an Agreement was executed at Lin^ah, by which Hassan Samaiyeh, the British Indian subject above referred to, claiming to act tor his two partners, gave to Mr. Robert Wonckhaus a specific monopoly of17 the output for four years, with a preferential option to renew at the end of that period. The terms of the transfer were such as to afford a considerable margin of profit on the original concession. The action of Hassan Samaiyeh was illegal because he did not hold a power of attorney from both his junior partners, and was guilty of fraudulent dealing in claiming to act for ihem both. On learning that a contract had been concluded between Hassan Samaiyeh and Messrs. Wonckhaus, the junior partner of the three original concessionnaires lodged a protest with the Sheikh of Shargah, petitioning that the contract with Mr. 'Wonckhaus might be annulled. Accordingly, in a letter dated the 21st February, 1907, the Sheikh of Shargah informed Hassan Samaiyeh of this complaint; he added that he had no right to grant such a monopoly to third parties without making any reference to the territorial Ruler ; that such conduct was a violation of duty; and that the continuance of the Concession in Hassan's hands was undesirable, and that the original contract had therefore been terminated. In reporting his action to Major Cox, the Sheikh said he was apprehen sive of the results of the transfer, and had accordingly cancelled the original Concession. He further requested that the Resident would consult the Imperial Government and request their views as to the best means of assuring to him in future the full benefits from the red oxide mines within his territory. On the 21st May, 1907, the British Resident reported that the Sheikh had taken active steps to prevent further mining operations, and that Messrs. Strick, the British lessees of the Hormuz red oxide mines, seemed inclined to commence negotiations with a view to the purchase of Abu Musa oxide. The Government of India considered, however, that it was undesirable that the rights of which Mr. Wonckhaus had been dispossessed should simultaneously be transferred to Messrs. Strick, as such an arrangement might create a false impression that the Sheikh's action had been inspired with a view to benefit the British firm. The Government of India were actuated, as appears from a letter addressed to the British Resident on the 11th February, 1907, by the know ledge that Abu Musa would form a convenient coaling station in the Persian Gulf, and that it was undesirable to allow the Germans to acquire vested interests, more especially in the form of a monopoly. His Majesty's Government concurred in the views of the Government of India that the-Sheikh should not be allowed to grant any monopoly in future, and thi.t he should be advised to submit to the British Resident the draft of any new contract into which he might propose to enter. On the 21st August Messrs. Strick were requested, in vi^w of local circumstances, to postpone, at any rate till the end of 1907, action on any agreement which might be arrived at with the Sheikn in the matter. On the 28th August the Government of India telegraphed that Hassan Samaiyeh, acting as local manager for Mr. Wonckhaus, had reinforced his miners and refused to stop mining operations, and that the Sheikh of Shargah considered force would be necessary to oust him from the island. In these circumstances the Sheikh asked that the Government of India would them selves eject the culprit, being a British subject, or else advise what action should be taken. On the 10th October, a formal notice from the Sheikh of Shargah was handed to Hnssan Samaiyeh, callins: upon him to cease forthwith from his mining operations, and to remove himself, and his workmen, machinery, and all instruments from the Island of Abu Musa within ten days. This notice was accompanied by a verbal communication from the British Residents representative, to the effect that if he failed to comply with the Sheikh s demands the Sheikh would hnve the approval of His Majesty's Government in ejecting Men, and would be supported in such forcible action as might be require!. The Sheikh showed some hesitation at the eleventh hour, owing to a letter which he had received from Mr. Wonckhaus advising him to withdraw18 his notice to quit, and to abstain from all further interference with the oxide mines and Concession which bad been pledged as security for loans made bv Mr. Wonckhaus to Hassan Samaiyeh. The Sheikh appeared apprehensive as to the possible intervention of the German Government. Lieutenant Gabriel, His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, appears to have acted with considerable address in overcoming the Sheikh's misgivinog and on the 20th October His Majesty's ship 'Lapwing ' sailed for Abu Musa* towing four buggalows containing a force of the Sheikh's armed retainers' The officer in command of this force was warned against the use of unneces^ sary violence. The armed party landed at different points on the island and surrounded the camp. The concessionnaire's representative and workmen were cowed and consented at once to leave, which they did, together with their effects, on the 22nd October. On the same day, Mr. Brown, the Agent of Mr. Wonckhaus, sailed for Abu Musa, accompanied by twenty-six men ; but on the 25th October the party returned to Lingah, having been refused permission to land by the Sheikh's guard, who behaved with resolution. Mr. Brown then announced his intention of going to Bushire in order to represent his case to the German Government. It was decided by the Government of India to favour Mr. Wonckhaus to ' the extent of allowing them, if they were so disposed, to remove the oxide lying on the beach, which was estimated to amount to some 500 tons. The Government of India issued instructions on the 17th November that the Sheikh of Shargah should be advised to keep a guard on the island until he had been informed by the Resident that he could safely remove it. On the 18th November His Majesty's Charg^ d'Affaires at Tehran tele graphed to the Viceroy of India, stating that he had already communicated to the German Minister the facts of the case as reported by the British Resident. Ihe ownership of the Islands of Tamb and Abu Musa was a few years ago claimed by Persia. A separate Memorandum on this subject is in course of preparation, and it suffices to state here that the rival claim of the Sheikh of Shargah was vigorously and effectively asserted by His Majesty's Government. 1 his aspect of the question has only an indirect bearing on the present controversy, since Mr. Wonckhaus bases his claim, however inconclusively upon a Concession originally granted by the Sheikh of Shar^ah to a British subject.

After compliments. —I have to communicate with your honour with refer ence to the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargah relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Abu Musa. As your honour is aware the document of lease was drawn up in the names of three persons namely your humble servant Esa bin Abdul Latif, Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh and Abdulla bin Hassan Samaiyeh. I have come to know that on 1st June 1906 (8th Rabi-ul-Thani 1324) the said Haji Hassan entered a contract with a European merchant named Wonckhaus, without consulting me, and that according to the terms of the document he bound himself and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the red oxide for a period of four years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this agreement and bound himself without consulting me previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this con tract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract for you to examine; kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps for the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I have written to Haji Hassan Samaiyah expressing my disagreement to this cmtract, but he has sent me no answer.22 Finally I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract in the beginning of which begins as follows : ' Contract between Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh of Lingah oxoner and holder of the Abu Musa Concession, and Mr. Eobert Wonckhaus of Lingah.' Now Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me giving him any general power in regard to action which he might take respecting the lease, etc.; how then has Haji Hassan the right thus to mention himself only without consulting or referring to his partners of whom I am one. I am in consequence obliged to make a complaint on the subject to your honour, and it is for your honour to issue orders. No. 8.

He has sent me a copy of the deed of contract in operation between you and Mr. ^onckhaus and complains that you executed this contract without consulting him and that he does not agree to the conditions written in the contract now that he has come to know them. I too do not agree to this contract at all, and as for you, you had no right to give a contract in this fashion and bind yourself to give away possession of the whole of the output of red oxide mines to others, for a long period and without consulting us or making the slightest reference to us.^ And according to our view harm will accrue to us from the continuance of this concession in your hands in connection with Abu Musa; and your conduct in the present case is a violation of your duty towards us. Accordingly it appears to us advisable to withdraw the document of con cession 1 rom you, and we now inform you accordingly by this letter, so that you may realise that the contract between us has terminated.

The Sheikh of Shnrgah, on hearing of this encroachment, declared that he could not tolerate the action of the Persian authorities, and, in virtue of Treaty relations appealed to His Majesty's Government to take the necessary steps with a view to preventing such interference with his territory. Major Cox, the British Resident, in commenting subsequently on the irresponsible action of the Customs officials on this occasion, wrote as follows:— ' I would observe in conclusion that signs are not wanting 1 to my mind to incline me to the belief that if we do not maintain a vigorous policy in connection with these islands in the Gulf, it will not be long before we are confronted with diflSculties in regard to the adjacent pearl fisheries, the preservation of which under the time-honoured conditions has always been one of the fundamental features of our policy in these waters/' The Government of India took a serious view of the incident, and proposed to dispatch a gunboat to the islands, with a representative of the Sheikh of Shargah on board, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the Jowasmi flag, and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided however, in the first instance to make representations to the Persian Government, and on the 24th May His Majesty's Minister reported that they had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the flags and guards from AHu Musa and Tamb, while reserving their right to discuss with His Majesty's Government the respective claims to the island. The following is the next of a note addressed by His Majesty's Minister to the Persian Government on the 15th June 1804 ;— ' Y our Excellency, ,c i have h 'ld the honour to receive your note of yesterday's date respecting Tamb and ( Abu Musa, and shall be happy to transmit to the Government of India any proofs with which ; you may favour me that the claims of the Persian Government to the ownership of these islands outweigh those of the Sheikh of Shargah. ] 'Your Excellency must, however, understand that I cannot agree to the suggestion, of which I hear for the first time, that this Trucial Chief should not be permitted to replace his flag pulled down by the Persian Customs officials, and I would remind you in this connectio n that we have net insisted upon the Persian Government removing their flag from the Island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the island, which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing Persian flag from Tamb and Abu Musa. What he did was to hoist his own flag upon the islands which were not yet formally occupied by any other Government, and he has the right to fly it as the first occupant, till his lawful possession of these islands is disproved.' In June 1904 Major Cox entered into communication with the Chief of Shargah, as Head Sheikh of the Jowasmi, respecting the rehoisting of the Jowasmi flags. Plagstaffs were erected on both islands and guards stationed there, and the Chiefs and inhabitants of the Pirate Coast were glad, and felt assured that the British Government w r ould protect them against enemies and would maintain their honour, and the people highly praised the British Govern ment. M. Nans, the Belgian Director of Customs, informed Sir A. Hardinge, &lt; in May 1904 that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had told him that the Persian claim to Tamb and Sirri was sound, but that to Abu Musa was more doubtful. No further Persian claim to Tamb and Abu Musa has been j reported since 3904. P art II.— Sirri. In June 1904 the Government of India instructed the Resident in the Presian Gulf to forward a report on the actual situation at Sirri, which the Persian Government had occupied in 1888, as it might be convenient to reopen^■TT- f 28 the question of the legality of the Persian occupation if the Persian Govern, ment should afford an opportunity by questioning the status of Abu Musa aad Tamb. Major Cox reported that Eis Majesty's Goyernment had never in anyway admitted, or withdrawn their original objections to the claim of the Shah'g Government to the ownership of the island; while it was equally clear from the records of the Eesidency that the Jowasmi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim to proprietary rights over Sirri any more than over Abu Musa and Tamb. As late as 1895 the said Sheikhs had declared that, although the Chief of Shargah on their behalf had duly represented to the British Government that the ownership of the island was vested in him, as Chief of the Jowasmis, the British Government had refrained from moving in the matter, and that they themselves had conse quently been unable to enforce their rights by their own unaided efforts. A full precis of the correspondence relating to the occupation of Sirri is contained in a letter, dated Bushire, the 19th August, 1888, from Colonel Ross to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran {vide Government of India, Proceedings September 1888, No. 104). Sir Arthur Hardinge, in commenting on the correspondence between Major Cox and the Government of India, deprecated raising the case of Sirri, unless the Persian Government forced the question upon His Majesty's Govern ment, since the latter were face to face with an occupation in which they had acquiesced for very many years, though they had not formally recogaized it. He added that M. Naus had consented to strike out Sirri from the lis Customs ports enumerated in the 4&lt; E6glement Douanier ' of (Signed) ALWfN PAEKER, Foreign Office, December 17, 1907.

The English gun-boat 'Lapwing' brought an Arab Sheikh from the Pirate Coast to Bu-Musa and conveyed the coolies of the firm of Wonckhaus by force back to the Persian mainland. This Arab Sheikh for his part stopped the work in the oxide mines, for which the firm holds contracts from the legitimate owners, which were concluded during my stay in the Gulf last year, and drove away the agents of the firm with gun-shots. The object is to get the oxide business into English hands and to deprive the Hamburg- America Line of the freight. Tor this the English require a third party, viz. % the alleged independent Arab Sheikh, who is nothing but an instrument in the hands of his English protectors. While the English press have been lately emphasizing the equal treatment of German trade and German shipping in Mesopotamia, this campaign against a successful German undertaking was carried out under the Arabian flag. The consequence will be a loss, firstly, to the rich native owner of the oxide mines, and, secondly, to German shipping and German trade, Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Telegram in the ' Cologne Gazette ' of December 13, 1907. (Translation.) Eor some time past English firms have exploited the oxide mines on the islands of the Persian Gulf, and recently the German firm of Wonckhaus and Co. have secured the right to work an oxide mine by leasing an island from a certain Sheikh. It is not impossible that this competition became inconvenient to the English firms who previously possessed a monopoly of this article, and it is therefore not unlikely that they encouraged another Sheikh to advance a claim to the possession of the island; but it is also possible that the Sheikh thought of the matter of his own accord. Whatever the reason may be, he landed with his followers and demanded that the employes of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. should leave the island, in which they had no right. These people, among whom there was no European, appear to have submitted to the Sheikh's demand without opposition. Nothing is known here of the report that a British ship of war took part in the seizure of the island, and it would seem more probable that the undertaking was carried out by the Sheikh and his followers alone. As yet there does not appear to be any ground for diplomatic action with the British Government on the part of Germany, but the German authorities are now busy in endeavouring to discover the real facts of the case. It will depend upon them what steps, if any, should be taken. It will be understood that this cannot be done in a moment, owing to the remote situation of the island and the complicated condition of titles to property in those parts, and therefore a certain amount of delay must elapse before the facts of the matter are clearly established. It is perfectly true that the German Government pursue no political interests in the Persian Gulf, and the rumour that Germany intends to establish a coaling station on the island in question is entirely without foundation Messrs. Wonckhaus' undertaking is of a purely com mercial nature, and as such they are entitled to the support of the State in the manner in which every State supports its subjects so long as their claims are justifiable. #30 Received on 27th January 1908 with Political Secretary 's letter No. 2, dated the 10th January 1908.

Your Excellency, On the 17th instant the Imperial Embassy gave Sir Charles Hardinge to understand that they were ready to lay before the British Government papers connected with the complaint of the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co., relative to the mines of oxide of iron at Abu Mu^a in the Persian Gnlf. These papers have now reached the Embassy and I have the honour to transmit them herewith, with copies of the in closures in duplicate. On the assumption that as the action of the Sheikh of Shargah, which has given rise to the German firm's complaint, took place, as far as can be Ml31 ascertained with the help of a British man-of-war and apparently in the presence of a British Consul, the British Government is now, or will be shortly in possession of detailed information with regard thereto, I have the honour to express the hope that Your Excellency will communicate in the same open way to the German Government the papers in possession of the British Govern ment. I have, etc., (Signed) STUMM. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Complaint of the German Firm R. Wonokhaus and Co. against the Sheikh of Shargah. According to papers, copies of which are in possession of the German Government, Salem -bin-Sultan, uncle of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah (Segger- bin-Chalid) is the owner of iron oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf, which appears to be included in the territory of the Sheikh of Shargah. In 1898 Salem -bin-Sultan by a document (Inclosure 1) leased his iron oxide mines on Abu Musa for a fixed yearly rent to a Company consisting of three British subjects, of whom a certain Hadschi Hassan-ben-All Samaye, as the eldest, conducted the affairs of the lessors. In 1899 the Company, consisting of the three lessors, admitted the reigning Sheikh of Shargah (Segger-bin-Chalid) into the Company, so that ike Company of lessors now consisted of four persons with equal 'ghts therein The Sheikh soon transferred his share to another person, Jussuf-bm-Abdullah. The latter sold his share subsequently to Hadschi Hassan -b in- All Samaye, the^above- mentioned managing partner of the Company The latter sold share in October 19^7 to the British 8ub3ect Mr. Thomas Brown, of Lingah, and a few days later he (Mr. Brown) sold the share to the German firm K. Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah (Inclosures 4 a to 4 a). These documents are attached to the last sheet of the original of the lease. The Company of lessors, therefore, consists apparently to-day of three British subjects and the German firm R. W5nckhaus and Co. The lease of the Company appears to be legally constituted ; this wat recognized by the reigning Sheikh of Shargah, since he himself was for a time a partner in the Company. . It appears, therefore, that an absolutely legitimate commercial business is concerned. , . , j .- * In the last few months the Sheikh has addressed to the above-mentioned British subject Hadsohi Hassan-bin-Ali Samaye, the managing partner, several communications (Inclosures 12. 16, 21,22) of which the last is said to have been handed to Samaye in the presence of the British Consular Agent st Lingah. In these communications he demanded that the working of t e mines at Abu Musa should be stopped. ... . , Further, in October 1907 the Sheikh sent armed men to the island, who forcibly expelled the miners and prevented the mines being worked. To boats with the Sheikh's armed men were towed to Abu Musa by the British m^of war ' Lapwing,' on board of which h said to have been Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, British Consul at Bander Abba • When a few days later, after the departure of the ih* -Rritish subiect, Mr. Thomas Brown, in the employment ot the Uerman firm R wLckhaus who are partners in the Company, and later another emnlove said to be a German, of the same house approached the island in order uTland there, they were compelled to return by shots from the Sheikhs armed men. . . . u By the forcible measures and the apparently m every res I' ec l1 ^32 prevented from enjoyinsr the lea^e granted to the Company by the proprietor of the mines, Salem -bin-Sultan, the uncle of the reigning Sheikh, The Company is thereby suffering losses since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantities of iron oxide at a fixed price (Inclosures 5, 19). In particular, the managing partner has entered into a contract (Inclosure 5), dated the 1st June, 1906, with the German merchant, Herr Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah (partner in the above-mentioned firm R. Wonckhaus and Co.), under which 2,000 to 5,000 tons are to be delivered yearly, for fo ur years to Herr Wonokhaus from the Abu Musa mines. The Company have also undertaken to deliver 400 tons yearly during five years in India {Inclosure 19). In both cases it is clearly a question of perfectly legitimate business operations as practised all over the world. The documents in possession of the Imperial Government lead them to certain conclusions with regard to the motives which have caused this conduct on the part of the Sheikh. In the above-mentioned communications from the Sheikh to the managing partner, Mr. Samaye, it is said :— 1. That the young Isa-bin-Abdul Latif, one of the partners in the Corn- pany, had complained to him, the Sheikh, that the contract with Rebort Wonckhaus had been concluded without his previous knowledge. This partner and he, the Sheikh, did not approve the contract. Samaye was not entitled without their approval to conclude a contract with regard to the whole production of the mines for a long period. They would suffer losses if they approved the contract (Inclosure 12). 2. That the Sheikh feared that the mines and. the island might be taken out of his possession (Inclosure 16, Confidential, also Inclosure 20). 3. That in the lease of 1898 there was no provision allowing th« whole production of the mines to be tiansferred to a foreigner without his approval. The Sheikh is thus speaking as if he had himself concluded the lease of 1898 with the lessors' Company (Inclosure 22). It is obvious that the Sheikh Segger-bin-Chalid did not conclude the lease of 1898 (Inclosure 1). This was done by his uncle, Salem-bin-Sultan, acting within his own rights, and the Sheikh recognized this by the fact that he him self was for a certain time a partner in the Company. It ip true that the le^se of 1898 contained no provision with regard to the sale of the production of the miners to foreigners. In view of the recognized liberty of tracta in the Persian Gulf it is to be inferred from the omission of such a prohibition that the conclusion of contracts with foreigners was without doubt within the powers of the Company, and not the reverse. The contract concluded in June 1906 between the Company and the German Herr R. V\ onckhaus, to which the Sheikh refers is, therefore, according to the lease srranted in 1898 by the Sheikh's uncle, absolutely admissible and legally unassailable. The Sheikhs fear that in consequence of the contract he might lose possession of the mines and the island is senseless. Apart from the xact that the mines do not belong to the Sheikh but to his Uncle Salem, the contract only grants to Herr Wonckhaus the right to receive at a fixed price during the fixed time of four years the greater part of the production of the mines an arrangement snch as any merchant could conclude when the oppor- tunity offered. Ihe contract does not refer to the acquisition of the mines t emselves or of the Island of Abu Musa, or to any separation of the island rom the Sheikh s territory, and it has no such aim in view. Herr Wonckhaus is a merchant like any other, he is not pursuing any political objects, and in cone uding the contract he has only made use of the right belonging to him, as o every merchant, to transact business which appears profitable to him. tit ' ^ii? 8 D( ? ?? l 8 s ^ own ky the contract of 1906, to say that Herr v onckhaus has bought the whole production of the mines. But even if he had one so t lere would be no objection to a business transaction such as takes pace eveiyw ere unhindered. That the contract might cause losses to the ompany, may indicate that it would perhaps be possible for the Company to c no u e a moie avourable contract for themselves. If this were the case, ere would even then be no legal objection to the contract.33 It maybe the case that the contract was concluded without the knowledge of the Sheikh. Meanwhile there is no reason why this contract should have required the approval of the Sheikh, as it was merely a legal and purely business transaction. It does not appear to be the case that the contract was concluded without the agreement of one of the partners of the Company, Isa-bin-Abdul Latif, as the managing pnrtner Samaye informed Isa's father Abdul Latif, who represented his son in all matters concerning the Company, at once of the conclusion of the contract, and the latter approved the contract in his reply (Inclosure 6). According to a later letter of the father, Abdul Latif (Inclosure 8), his son Isa appears to recognize the contract as legally valid, although he would have liked to have seen it before its conclusion, as he describes its abrogation simply as ' preferable,' and in the next letter of Abdul Latif senior (Inclosure 10) the latter says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son» Even if one of the partners desires to attack the validity of the contract of 1906 by stating that it required his consent, which had not been obtained, yet it is impossible to see how this gives the Sheikh the right to abrogate by force the lease of 1898 granted by his uncle Salem. This would appear, therefore, to be a question of a purely arbitrary, and, from the leiral point of view, absolutely indefensible proceeding on the part of the Sheikh of Shargah against the lessors* Company. This illegal action affects directly the German firm R. Wonckhuus and Co. as partners in the Company, and is not a claim raised by the German firm against the other partners in the Company. Their complaint is based on their own rights as partners in the Company, and it will be the Sheikh's duty to compensate the German partner as well as the other partners in the Company, who are British subjects, for his illegal action. The losses which have accrued to the Company are very considerable, as they cannot evade the obligations assumed by them in the above-mentioned contracts (Inclosures 5 and 19), especially in the contract (Inclosure 5) con cluded in 1906 with the German Herr Wonckhaus, which contract appears to have caused the Sheikh to commit bis act of aggression. Through this contract immediate losses are incurred by the Company, as they have been prevented by the forcible measures of the Sheikh from delivering 2,000 tons of iron oxide to Herr Wonckhaus which had already been extracted, and which ought to have been shipped weeks ago. Further losses will be caused by the fact that the Company is not in a position to extract at the proper time the quantities of iron oxide which they must keep ready for the deliveries due in the coming months. As Herr Wonckhaus, on his side, has already resold the iron oxide to his shipper, and now in order to fulfil this obligation must buy iron oxide elsewhere at a high price, it is obvious that the loss accruing to the Company through the counter-claim of Herr Wonckhaus amounts to a large sum, and will be greatly increased by any further prevention of the working of the mines. The Imperial Government consider therefore that it is urgently necessary to settle the matter at once and think that the British Government will agree with them, in view of the fact that the other partners of the Company, who are suffering equally from the arbitrary action of the Sheikh, are British subjects. In the first place, it will be necessary that the Sheikh of Shargah, in order to avoid further losses, should, without delay, allow the Company to work the iron oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa. Later on it will be necessary to deal with the question of compensation for the losses suffered by the Company. It will also be necessary to consider whether the circumstance that armed men of the Sheikh's fired on employes of Wonckhaus who wished to land on the island requires special reparation on the part of the Sheikh. Mr. Thomas Brown, whose life was seriously endangered, is, as already stated,a British subject, while the nationality of the other employe concerned, who describes himself as a German, requires to be established.

Hassan-ben-Semey gives the entire monopoly of Abu Musa oxide to Mr. Robert Wonckhaus. During the term of the contract he is not allowed to sell or dispose of otherwise any quantity of Ben Musa during the term of this oon- tract, but it is agreed upon that Hassan is permitted to export to In jia ior his account during this year what he has sold already in India, and wbich he gives as 700 tons, and besides that every year from 1907 about 5,000 ^,000 ba&lt;?s ol 1 cwt. (four thousand to five thousand bags). Hassan-ben -Semey has to deliver daily alongside, if in bays, 200 tons, or in bulk 150 tons, weather permitting. Payment for every lot which is to be shipped: half the amount when the lot is ordered, and the other half when it is being shipped. Advance to be paid by Mr. Robert Wonckhaus to Hassan-bon-Semey rupees whenever Hassan calls for it, and receipt to be taken for it. This advance to remain with Hassan-ben-Semey until the end of this contract. Whenever tin's contract comes to an end Mr. Robert Wonckhaus has the preference for a new contract of Ben Musa, if he desire so, at the same price and condition, or at any rate at the price of other serious buyers. Alone the English text of the contract will hold good. HAGE HASSAN-BEN-ALI SEMEY AND C O. (Inclosure 6.) Abdul Ltjtif-ben-Abdul Rahmen to Haji Hassan-bbn-Ali Semey.

But abstain from engaging yourself in any contract which may resemble a leasehold or any other engagements which might occasion any row. Our officials would bo displeased, and would not like it.

My son Isa does not agree to the contract with these conditions, and you neither consulted him, nor did you send a copy of the contract before you concluded the oxide business with the Germans, so as to compare your ideas and work in concordance. Obviously it is necessary that a partner engages himself only after consulting his partners in order to avoid trouble. You have entered into this work without having his opinion; for this reason my son Isa does not agree to the contract which exists between you and the Germans, because Isa fears the trouble that may arise in consequence of taking strangers into this busi ness. The cession (cessation ?) of this contract would be preferable to its conti nuance. I have written you before not to engage yourself in the oxide business with the Germans, because he fears bad consequences. So says my son Isa. Be this known to you. ABDUL LATIF-BEN-ABDUR RAHMAN.

When I received your letter saying that you had sold to the Germans of the oxide of the Island of Abu Musa 2,000 tons every year at 16s. per ton, my reply, under date of 2l8t Rebic-el-Thani, 1324, shows that I agreed, but it contained a warning that your engagements should not resemble a^easehold or something which might occasion a row, and which would displease our officials. We requested you to give us a guarantee that there would be no trouble; the mentioned letter is certainly in your possession, the contents admit of no doubt. After receipt of the copy of the contract, which we demanded frequently, on the 5thl)hul Kada, 1324, and which was written in English, and of which we acknowledged receipt on the 6th Dhul Kada, 1324, and after we found some body to translate it, we found that you had entered engagements against which we had warned you, and that you had bound yourself to a leasehold, for which reason my son Isa does not agree to the contract which takes the working and management of the mines from our hands. We informed you of this before on the 8tli Dhul Hadj, when Isa saw the conditions of the contract; and when you see the inclosed translation of the contract you will understand that the question is not as you have understood it, only a sale, but a leasehold against which we warned you. Sheikh Seger-ben-Khalet does not agree to your giving a leasehold of oxide to strangers of Foreign Powers, and asserts that the arrangement is that the partners themselves only work as they have done for the last few years. ^ It is not known that you gave leaseholds before this.

Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey to Abdul Latlf-bin-Abdur Rahman. 15th Safar, 1325. After compliments. —I have received your letter and noted contents. Regarding the contract with the Germans, which you say is not, as I have explained before, sale of oxide only, my friend, I am convinced that it is a sale of oxide only for a certain period, and a certain quantity every year until the contract expires. It is not a leasehold for the island. The agreement and conditions are as follows : He agrees to take every year a fixed quantity, and we agree to dig it from the mines and deliver it as long as there is oxide, just as it has been customary before. Prom everybody who sells something a sale contract is taken; this is not a leasehold once for ever, and you know that neither the Germans nor anybody else have any power over me; but perhaps you have been forced to this correspondence. The Germans bought oxide only, nothing else, from the owners of the leasehold of the oxide mines in Abu Musa, Hage-ben-Ali Semey and Co. We have arranged that if we deliver the oxide in Lingah and pay the transport expenses, he has no objections and is quite agreeable, and will not insist on going to the island and possess himself of it. Also you wrote me saying that perhaps I could cancel the contract. I spoke to him about it. He answered : ' If you say that we have intentions with the island, we shall give you a letter that we have nothing whatever to do with it; we have only bought oxide from the leaseholders of the oxide mines in Abu Musa for a fixed period, just as other people buy ^ from you. We do a large business with all the merchants on the Persian and Arabian coasts, and have never had trouble with the people. If you do not accept this letter and you want to be released from the contract, all right, pay us for every ton !{;«., as per contract, and also the advances which we have paid to you; when you have paid us that, we do not require the contract and shall return it. We insist upon our rights.40 Wp are not here to play at doing business, and we work and go in accordance wini liw ' If yon think it advisable, please write to them and explain to TCL . perhaps they will meet you. I cannot see my way to do anything oATitrarv to the sale conditioos until the contract expires. You are the Lord nf the Learned; you know that I did this knowing that you were agreeable to it The thing being done, it is better to stop tins dispute. hen the Germans o Aree to eive you a letter according to your own wish, saying that they hare houeht oxide only from Hassan-ben-Ali Semey and Co., and have nothing to ,lo with the leasehold of the island, that settles everything. Yon know that such a sale in one item is not obtainable every day, and we have a large amount invested since the date of the Concession; until now, who of the partners gave a single penny ? And if we don't sell, who will give us our money ? You know that a sale is debarrassmg ; when it is made it decreases the liabilities of the partners ; when there is no sale, the partners must pay whatever the expenses are. After his arrival trom Calcutta, Abdulla will close the books and show you everything. Please inform Isa of this. HASSAN-BEN-ALI SEMEY &amp; Co. (Inclosure 12.)

He has sent us the copy of contract existing between you and Robert Wonckhaus, and presents a complaint saying that you have concluded this contract without consulting him, and after seeing it he does not agree to the conditions mentioned in the contract, and I also do not agree to this contract—under no circumstances. You have no right to give a contract of such a nature and bind yourself, and possess a third person of all that the mines yield for a long period, without consulting us or informing us at all. As we will sustain a loss by allowing this contract regarding the Island of the Abu Musa which is in your hands to continue, and you have acted in this unauthorized manner on our behalf, we have now thought it advisable to withdraw the leasehold from you. Now I inform you by this letter so that you may know that the contract is expired between us, and you have no right to make use of the mines in Abu Musa. Let this be known. Inclosure No. 13. Hassan-ben-Ali Semey to Sheikh Segbr-ben-Khalet. Jfter compliments. —Your favour of this month's date received and contents noted. Regarding the letter, in which Abdul Latif agrees to the contract with the Germans, and at the same time warns us against giving a leasehold or something similar, yes, I have not acted contrary to that letter, and the Germans have nothing to do with the leasehold of that island. I have only sold oxide of iron. When Abdul Latif received answer to his letter it proved to him that I had not acted wrongly. I had only sold oxide ot iron. We are responsible for nothing else but the sale of oxide of iron to the Germans. You say that I had stated that I am the owner of the island; how could I make such an assertion, as I have taken in lease only the mine of oxide of iron, which is in the Island of Abu Musa, from Sheikh Salem -ben- Sultan, and pay a certain sum as rent to Sheikh Salem every year according to the leasehold. But your statement that I had written that I am the lease- holder, it is right, and sale and management are in my hands. The partners know well, that from the beginning of the Concession the sale, expenditure, management, and requirements have been duly looked after by me, and from41 the date of the contract the entire management has been in my hands and none of the partners have interfered, nor had they any right to do so unless I had acted contrary to law. I quite admit that I am a British subject any abiding and do not deserve this unjustifiable interference, and you know that Germans have no other claim but the purchase of oxide for a certain period ; and you are well aware that large amounts of our money have been invested in the oxide mines. If we do not obtain sales, how are we to repay the Germans and others? So much was necessary. Compliments to all. (Inclosure 1-1.)

We beg to submit that on the 18th Muharrem, '1325, we received a letter from Sheikh Seger-ben -Khalet, Chief of Shargah, saying that Isa-ben-Abdul Latif has lodged a complaint with him to the effect that he does not agree to the contract which we have made with E. Wonckhaus, the German, asserting that it was made without his knowledge. Sheikh Seger also drops a hint that he wishes to withdraw the leasehold for the oxide of iron mines in Abu Musa which we leased from Sheikh Salem-hen-Sultan. We, being British subjects, and seeing that the letter of Sheikh Seger has no meaning, we thought it necessary to inform you of this before they mis represent the matter to you. We hold the original leasehold from the Sheikh Salem-ben-Sultan of 1315, to be continued for any period we desire ; attested by your agent, Abdul Latif, we accepted Sheikh Seger as a partner with the knowledge and evidence of Abdul Latif. We made known our contract with the Germans and its conditions in Arabic and English to Abdul Latif. Then we received a letter from your agent, dated the 21st Rebic-el-Thani, 1324, regarding the contract with the Germans; in that letter he expresses his acceptance and gladness. We beg to inclose the copy of that letter. Also Isa was informed and agreed in the question ; the letter of Sheikh Seger shows that he intends to stop the work and make us suffer a loss, for which reason we inclose copy of his letter before a dispute arises. You are our protectors, and it was necessary ior us to inform you, because all our transactions and contracts were made with the knowledge and approval of Isa and Abdul Latif, and the original leasehold with their signatures are in our possession. If Abdul Latif had not approved he would have stopped me in the letter of the 21st Biebic-el-Thani, and I have on |y treated with the Germans with his approval, and in our contract with the Germans we have sold oxide only—a merchandize is for everybody, the Germans and others. o ^ HASSAN-BEN-ALI SEMEY &amp; Co.

Begarding the complaint lodged with us by Isa-ben-Abdul Latif concerning the oxide in Abu Musa, you mention that your contract with the Germans was made by his and his father's knowledge, as per letter dated 21st Kebi-ul-Thani, 1324. In the same letter he also warns you against entering engagements resembling a lease or binding yourself in such way as to occasion a row; he further mentions that you should go a sure way, because bis officials would not agree to it. The existing contract between you and the Germans, and the condi. tions which you have bound yourself to, are altogether contrary to tiie letter of Isa's father, which you mention. The reason that we are frightened of your work is that it is not remote that the mines go out of our sphere. 'We entered into this with you knowing that you are British subjects. We did not tell you to make contracts with strangers from foreign Powers without informing us, and to bind yourself. You have no right to make use of it and write on the head of the contract that you are the owners and possessors of the lease held in Abu Musa. To this we never agree, and you are not allowed to take oxide of iron from Abu Musa Island on the condition which you have made, unless the business is put on a footing of which we need not fear the consequence. This you should know. SHEIKH SEGEE-BEN-KHALET; Inclosure 17. S alem-bin -S ultan to H amed-bin -A li S emeyye. In the name of ... . God !

Saker. We do not understand the interference of fe. feaker. Should this really be a fact, the action of s. Saker is contrary o aw. He has no right to raise any objections and interfere with us. He s on remember that he, as you know, has been one of the partners who sold his share to us, and for this reason we assert that he has no risht to interfere with us, nor to stop the coolies from digging in the oxide mines. He must 'now anc recognize that the stoppage of work means a great loss to us, as we, even during the delay, have to pay the coolies their dailv wages. We conjec- uie ia t us pioceeding of S.

It is astonishing that S. Saker goes beyond his liiui ts 'i mcid* 11 H\ 43 and interferes in a matter which has been concluded with the consent and approval of the British Agent. We have this moment written to Khan Bahadur, Political Agent Abdul Latif, because from the beginning of our leasehold with you and otbersj we liave done all by his knowledge and approval, and because we consider liimone of our partners, and we wish to know his final reply. Keally we do not want all these troubles and disputes, but as you know, when necessity arises, one is obliged to stand up and defend his rights, which naturally entails a noisy dispute. We are compelled to address ourselves to onr Government, and claim whatsoever losses we sustain from him who interferes. This action of S.- Saker is due to his jealousy or you and us, but we hope that so long as you are in existence, we have every confidence, and strangers have no rights over us. In these days my son Abdullah arrived from India, and intended to see you and pay his respects, and now awaits an opportunity. We beg you to inform us of their object in this matter.

Regarding all what you state about the question of Sheikh Saker-bin- Khaled and his prohibition of your working oxide mines in Abu Musa, from what I gather from him he will not remove the prohibition unless he can make a clear arrangement with you in this matter. He replies that the Island of Abu Musa is his property, and so long as he calnnot make suitable arrangements he considers himself a loser. If he did not formerly interfere, it was due to the good understanding existing between you, but now he cannot leave the case alone as before, because a stranger has entered therein, and he is afraid that by and by the island will get out of his possession. This is his answer, and you must know that I cannot at present interfere in the matter, as I see the question has become complicated. ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDUL RAHMAN. Inclosure No. 21.

In accordance with our contract dated the 18th Zilkada, 1315, correspond ing to the 11th April 1898, we agreed to lease the oxide of iron mines situated in the Island Abu Musa to Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey, Abdulla-ben-Hassan, and Isa-ben-Abdul Latif. The contract does not contain a clause authorising you to give the whole output of oxide of iron to one stranger without our consent. Because Hage H assan-ben-Ali Semey made a contract without our consent with Robert Wonckhaus in Lin gab on the 1st June 1906, and gave him right of purchase of all this output of the mines in Abu Musa; we informed the said Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey in our letter dated the 9tli Muharrem 1325, corresponding to the 21st February 1907, that this leasehold, dated the 18th Ziikada 1315, had expired, and that he had no right to make use of the mioes in Abu Musa in future. We learn that, in spite of our prohibition, he still works the oxide mines in Abu Musa and enjoys the profits. On this account we hereby proclaim to the said Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey, and demand from him the immediate cession of work in the mines and removal of himself, his employed, and all his mining implements from the Island of Abu Musa within ten days from the date that this notice reaches him.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter of Sind January 1908. His Majesty's Ambassador at Berlin to Foreign Office, London. (No. 559.) Berlin, 27th December 1908. S ir, The German Press continues to occupy itself with the Abu Musa incident, and a great many complaints are raised at what is called the grasping attitude of England. In an article entitled the ' Open Door ' the Kolniscbe Volkszei- tung, Rhenish organ of the Centre Party, compares the English attitude towards foreign enterprise in the Persian Gulf with French proceedings ip Morocco since the Algeciras Agreement. It complains that German trade and German enterprise are unable to attempt anything in the Gulf without a cry that English rights are being transgressed. Thus a Dutch German obtained permission to undertake irrigation works in the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and procured the necessary permission from Tehran. The British Government intervened and declined to allow the Sheikh to open his door to others on the ground that he was under British protection. The case is similar with the question of the exploitation of minerals. The ordinary person will find it difficult to comprehend how a British protectorate can be held to prevent foreigners to acquire such rights in the territory of British proteges. It is not o^ly exaggerated anti-Germans like the editor of the National Review who holds this view, but also sensible and respectable papers like the Fall Mall Gazette. It is hard to understand why England should take active measures to prevent German merchants from acquiring rights from British subjects, such as the exploitation of the oxide mines, which is a purely commercial and in no way political matter. But English opinion regards it not as a commercial but as a Political matter. This view must 5372 f. d.naturally be combated energetically by the Government in Berlin and England must be shown that she must not threaten and forcibly chase away any non- Englishman who establishes a legitimate business in the Persian Gulf. Thug the Magdeburg Gazette says, Germany must insist upon her claim to equal commercial treatment in the Persian Gulf. No one has the right to forbid Germans to trade in those waters, to establish a coaling depot or to acquire au oxide mine there. The only person who has any say in this matter is the Shah of Persia. The position of England in the Persian Gulf is as follows:—She possesses well-known but still definitely limitedjrightsof sovereignty. The eastern shores constitute the Sultanate of Muscat, a state over which England acquired a protectorate when France sought to establish a coaling station there. West of Muscat comes the Turkish province of El Hasa, before which lie the Bahrein Islands which have been under British protection since 1861. North of El Hasa lies Koweit, that once was foreshadowed as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway, but in order to prevent this the English took the Sheikh under their protection. There has however never been any question of Great Britain exercising any rights over El Hasa and the whole of the opposite coast of the Gulf is indubitably Persian. Persia is recognised as an independent country by all, and in the Anglo-Russian Agreement the spheres of influence of the two countries are carefully defined. Furthermore in the exchange of notes between the two Governments, which took place when the Agreement was concluded, it was stated that the countries which that instrument were held to affect were only those coterminous with Russian or British territory in Asia, and it was therefore not held to be suitable to include a declaration of the paramount interest of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf. Russia may have recognised British interests in the Gulf, but that does not aflect other powers. Russia had no territory there and therefore no interests to surrender, This however does not bind other powers; nor does the Agreement give England any right over Persian territory. The Eastern shores of the Gulf belong to the central portion of Persia in which neither England nor Russia guarantees a preponderane to the other. Abu Musa according to the German view belongs to Persia, and a British warship had no business therefore to interfere with any German undertaking in the island.

Mr. Mallet said that Herr 'Wonckhaus had been permitted by the Sheikh to ship all the accumulated oxide, but that he feared it would be impossible for him to allow the concessionnaires of the mines to recommence mining operations. He would, however, report the suggestion to me, and the Govern ment of India would be consulted. Mr. Mallet added that, as far as the question had been examined in this Department, it appeared that Herr Wonckhaus' claim would lie against Hassan Samaiyeh, the British Indian subject who concluded the agreement with him, but that the German representation would be most carefully considered, and a reply sent to him as soon as possible. Herr von Stumm said that in the view of the German Government th e question was of a commercial and not of a political nature, and Mr. Malle^ said that I looked upon it in the same light.

S ir, I have the honour to report that I called upon Herr von Sehon this morning, and His Excellency informed me that he had sent some documents about the Abu Musa incident to Count Metternich for communication to you. He did not in the least wish to treat this as a political question, and it was being dealt with in the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office, but the papersJiad taken it up, and it was perhaps unfortunate that a British gun-hoat should have taken an active part in a commercial dispute. I replied that as the German Ambassador in London was s^oing to talk to you on the subject I did not propose to discuss it with him, but I had no doubt that you would be glad to hear that the German Government were not disposed to attach political importance to it. Ilerr von Schon went on to say that Germany had no political interests in Persia, and gave me to understand that the activity of the German Charge d Affaires had been by no means agreeable to him, and it would probably be necessary before long to appoint a new German Minister to Tehran. I said that I bad heard, that Baron von flichthofen had displayed undesirable activity, not only during the present crisis but also when he had5 acted as Charge d'Affaires on a previous occasion. Herr von Schon interrupted me by saying that there was another foreign Representative of Tehran who seemed to wish to give himself undue importance, and he could not understand why the French Minister should have put forward a claim to be present with the English and Kussian Representatives at the ceremony of the Shah's taking the oath to the Constitution to the exclusion of the other foreign Representa tives. It was only natural, in consequence of the special position which England and Russia occupied in Persia, that their Representatives should he present at the ceremony, but if the French Minister were there, there could be no reason for the other diplomatists to be kept away. I said that this was the first I had heard of such a claim being put forward by the French Minister I knew that he had warmly supported his English and Russian colleao-ues and I thought I should have heard it he had sought to obtain an exceptionaf position for himself. Herr von Schon, however, seemed certain of his facts. I have, etc., FRANC C. LASCELLES.deceived m the 10th Feburary with Folitioal Secretary's letter No. 4, dated the 24:th January 1908.

I TOLD the German Ambassador to-day that since I had last seen Lima difficulty hnd arisen with regard to the contract of Messrs Wonckhaus res pecting red oxide on the Island of Abu Musa. I was very much obliged to the German Government for having put the rise so fullv before us. Their statement differed m some important particulars from the information which I had so far received. Their Statement had now been handed to the India Office to be sent out by mail, m order that it might be carefully examined and that I might be supplied with the fullest possible information. The Indian Government had a Resident at Bushire, from whom we could get full information. Count Metternich remarked that he thought a British Consul had been on the gun-boat which visited Abu Musa. I said this very probably was the case. We had a Treaty with-the Sheikh dating back to a very long time ago, but finally confirmed and ratified in 1892, by which the Sheikh was under our protection and had agreed not to enter into any Agreement or correspondence with any other Power. I must wait for further information on the points submitted by the Ger man Government. But 1 might say at once that although, as the Mining Concession had been cancelled some time ago, no fresh oxide could be mined pending a further decision, yet it seemed clear that Messrs. Wonckhaus were entitled to the red oxide which had actually been mined already, which was waiting to be taken away, and which might be regarded as already sold to them, ATcomplaint had been made that when their agent, Mr. Brown, visited Abu Musa the Sheikh's officers had fired upon him; and we were sending instructions to the Indian Government in order that they might do whatever w^s necessary to insure that, if Messrs. Wonckhaus visited the island for the purpose of taking away the oxide which was waiting there for removal, there should be no further trouble of the kind. I am, &amp;c. E. GEEY.

[78] S ir E dward gretf to H eurvon S tumm. Foreign Office, January 10, 1908. Sir E. Grey has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the note from the German Charge d'Affaires, dated the 31st December, 1907, on the subject of the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and a native British subject for the purchase of red oxide from the island of Abu Musa. His Majesty's Government fully appreciate the courtesy of the German Government in communicating without reserve the documents in their posses sion, and the examination of the German case is being actively pursued. The facts set out in these papers differ materially from those which had been reported to Sir E. Grey, and it will be necessary for His Majesty's Government to apply to the parties concerned for further information. Sir E. Grey observes that Messrs. Wonckhaus claim that they are now partners in the Concession originally granted in 1898, but inasmuch as this concession had. been cancelled by the Sheikh of Shargah some months before any share therein was transferred to Messrs. Wonckhaus, he cannot admit that they are entitled to assume any such position. At the present juncture His Majesty's Government do not think that it would be desirable that the Sheikh of Shargah should permit the Company to resume work at the mines—any attempt to do so might not improbably result •in further confusion. His Majesty's Government, however, see no objection to Robert Wonckhaus removing the red oxide, which has already been mined and is now ready for shipment from the island. If this proposal as to the removal of the red oxide in question meets with the concurrence of the German Government His Majesty's Government would advise the Sheikh accordingly, and would arrange for the Indian Government to take whatever step seemed desirable to insure that all proper facilities are placed at the disposal of Mr. Wonckhaus for the removal of the oxide, and to prevent any local friction or conflict bet ween Mr. Wonckhaus and the men of the Sheikh of Shargah.(Received, on the 10th February 1908, under cover of a letter from His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, No. 1, dated the Srd January 1908.) Tehran, 31st December 1907. No. 281. Sir, On tbe 6th ultimo I received from the German Legation the memoran dum, of which a copy is enclosed, stating that certain employes of the German firm of Wonckhaus bad been driven by the Sheikh of Shargah from the mines of red oxide on Abu Musa island which they were working in virtue ot: an agreement with the concessionaires, and that one of His Majesty's ships had been present to afford assistance to the Sheikh. I replied in a private note to M. Stemricb, with whom I was on very friendly terms, that I would telegraph for a report of the occurrence from His Majesty's Resident at Bushire, but that, from what I knew of the case, I believed that Messrs. Wonckhaus'' contract was invalid as it had been made with only one of three joint concessionaires and without the knowledge or consent of the other two. In a subsequent conversation I told him that the Sheikh of Shargah was under British protection. I said also that I was not sure how far the Legation had jurisdiction in such a question, but I was inclined to believe that it rested wholly with His Majesty's Resident at Bushire. Major Cox's telegraphic report reached me on the 15th, and on the same day I communicated to M. Stemrich the memorandum of which a copy is enclosed. The German Minister replied acknowledging my memorandum and saying that he expected a report from the German Consul at Bushire, of the contents of which I expected to be informed by the German Charge d'Affaires; but beyond a casual reference to it by myself a few days later, there was no mention of the case until December 14th, when I learnt from Major Cox's telegram, of which a paraphrase is enclosed, that the German Consul had been in direct and official commanication with the Sheikh, refusing to recognise the cancellation of the concession and threatening him with a claim for heavy damages. I therefore sent my telegram No. 379 of December 14th to you. Sir, suggesting that I should be authorized to inform Baron Richthofen of the Sheikh's obligations to His Majesty's Government under the protectorate treaty of March 7th, 1892, and requesting him to instruct Dr. Listemann to regulate his conduct accordingly. At the same time^I requested Major Cox to desire the Sheikh to take no notice of Dr. Listemann's letter. On the 20th instant, in accordance with your instructions, I addressed to Baron von Richthofen the letter of which a copy is enclosed. Having received no reply on the 29th, 1 wrote asking for one, and the following day Baron von Richthofen called on me. He said that he had delayed answering my letter as he was expecting instructions from Berlin on the question, but he assured me that he had already informed Dr. Listemann of our relations with the Sheikh of Shargah and would write to me in that sense. To-day I received the promised note, copy of which I enclose herewith. He said, however, that German Consular officials had frequently had direct communications with the Sheikh before now, and that in any case Dr. Listemann's present letter had been quite unofficial. I replied that this was the first we had heard of any such irregular communications, and that in any case a written communication conveyed by the Consul's dragoman could scarcely be looked upon as private. Baron von Richthofen also stated that the Sheikh had fired upon a German subject named Brown when he was trying to land at Abu Musa from a 50i2 F. D.TT o mburff -Araerica steamer for the purpose of removing some machinery and other tackle belonging to Messrs Wonckhaus, and that this was a serious matter I said 1 had no news of this. But I pointed out again that, even if Wonckhaus 5 contract bad been valid, which it was not, German ageats had no business to have mining machinery on land or to work there, as the contract had only stipulated for delivery on board. As regards the validity of the contract, my German colleague asserted that Messrs. Wonckhaus have a private letter of some kiad from the other two concessionaires agreeing to the contract. I said that on the contrary I had written information stating clearly that one at least of the concessionaires (Esa Bin Abdul Latif) had always protested against the contract and denied its validity as having been made without his knowledge or assent, I have, however, asked Major Cox to inform me whether there is any foundation lor these statements. I gather that the German Legation contemplates justifying Dr. Listemann's action on the ground that Abu Musa is Persian territory and does not form part of the Sheikh of Shargah's dominions under our protection. Baron von Richthofen has been trying to obtain a written declaration on the point from the Persian Government, but Mushir-ed-Dowleh is unwilling to make any statement either one way or another. I propose to remind His Excellency of the fact that in 1904 the Persian flag was removed from the island on our demand, and to warn him of the complications which will be entailed by an attempt to revive the Persian claim to the island. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, S ir, Your most obedient, humble servant, CHARLES M. MARLING.

Wonckhaus, Linga, reports that at instigation of English and under shelter of gunboat Lapwing the Sheikh of Shargah sent 200 armed men to island of Abu Musa to prevent firm's workmen working red oxide mines. Brown sailed thither on the 22nd ultimo for inquiry, was shot at, unhurt and unallowed to land, thus compelled to return to Linga. Workmen were driven out of island in presence of gunboat with English Consul from Bandar Abbas on board who state they appeared on the scene to keep peace, whereas workmen say in order to help Sheikh in their expulsion. Listemann will probably arrive next Monday. ABDUL HUSSEIN. Inclosure in Mr. Marling's Despatch No. 281 of 31st December 1907. Copy. MEMORANDUM. On November 6th the German Legation communicated to the British Legation a telegram from Bushire, signed Abdul Hussein, reporting complaints from Wonckhaus, Linga, relative to the working of the red oxide mines at Abu Musa. It is evident that this telegram has been sent upon erroneousinformation as to the alleged facts of the complaint, and also in complete mis apprehension of tbe existing conditions at Al u IVI iisq . Ihe real facts and condi tions are set forth helow for the inform ation of tbe German Legation. The privilege of extracting oxide from Abu Musa had been leased on a year's basis by tbe Sheikh of Shargah to a syndicate of three British subjects One of the concessionaires complained to tbe Sheikh a few months ago that, without his knowledge or concurrence, a monopoly of the purchase of the out put of oxide had been granted to a fourth party by another of the concession aires. The obvious illegality and invalidity of such a grant was pointed out t &gt; the German Minister in a letter by Mr. Marling acknowledging the receipt of the telegram in question. In view therefore of tbe fact that one of three concessionaires was clearly incapable of granting a monopoly without authorisation from his colleagues, and in view of the Sheikh's own strong personal objection to the existence of such a monopoly, the latter decided to resume the concession, and accordingly informed the British concessionaire to this effect. The British concession aire, however, did not stop his mining operations ou receipt of tbis notice. On October 10th, therefore, the Sheikh formally notified him that he would be forcibly ejected if, within ten days, he had not removed his workmen and implements. As, however, the concessionaire still neglected to comply, an armed guard was sent by the Sheikh to carry out the eviction. To avoid un necessary harshness or violence it was deemed advisable that the British Consul at Bander Abbas snould be present as a spectator on board H, M. S. Lapwing. From this the following points are clear (1) That it was the British subject whose workmen were ejected, not Mr. Wonckhaus' employes; that if anyone could consider him self harshly used-— which was apparently not the case—it would be the British subject, not Mr. Wonckhaus. (2) That the British Consul was present in a gunboat in the interests of good order in a case which concerned a British subject. Any other allegations, such as those made in Abdul Hussein's telegram, are therefore quite erroneous. (3) That even if Mr. ^V^onckhaus' contract was valid—*-and he must undoubtedly, as a business man, have known that it was not—it, concerned only the pwrcAasg of oxide delivered on board steamers, and he had no concern whatever either with the mines or with mining op rations. The British Legation hopes that the foregoing remarks have made it clear to the German Lesratiou that the question concerns Sheikh of Shargah and the British concessionaire alone, and that the Agent, Abdul Hussein, was in ignorance of the true facts of tbe case when he despatched his telegram. The concession having now been resumed by its owner, the differences between the lessees have been removed by the removal from their hands of the subject of contention; and the whole matter seems therefore to call for no further comment.

Agha Bedr says he submitted a report in this connection some time ago and on his return to Lingah will submit full rep )rt making reference to his previous one. TrevorHenjam , 17-4-08.

Consequently some 400 tons of heap on beach are left of which 'Louise' might possibly have taken half as she has loaded some hundred tons of shells at Lin gah and was still there when I left at mid day having evidently some space and time to spare. 'Louise' left Island at midnight accompanied by'Lawrence' as I wished to give Mirza every opportunity of cooperating with Agha Badr in deciding weight of oxide contained in ships loading buckets which had been unit of tally throughout and which Hassan said carried 1 ton while Rosenfelt said less. Mirza had declined to do this at Island on ground that the six buckets were all of different sizes and that there were no accurate scales and other pretexts but promised me it) course of an interview last evening that he would do it at Lingah. even tually however he said it was unnecessary as in the meanwhile Hassan had come to an understanding with iiosenfe.lt to mutually agree that 1810 tons had been loaded re mainder being estimated at about 400 tons. Jound Skipper of 'Louise' had decided to IThenTTiien Agh.a Badr ^ent to 'Louise' late last night to tell^we would be at Ling ah he en deavoured to get him to sign a proces^ ver bal in this sense bringing in some sort of estimate of stuff near mines« Agha Badr re fused to do this. On arrival at Lingah ins tructed hi'm to say that he was prepared to a/ draw up proces verbal, &amp;£ weighment carried out otherwise if parties dreYf up document in duplicate on lines of their above men tioned agreement he would countersign it as agreed to in his presence.

I have therefore visited Lingah and propo ed to ..la^san that he hould gife me an undertaking similar to the previous one,and should transport the oxide accumulated near the mines to the beach. He consulted Brown and replied that during the ensuing three months active operations will not be pos sible on account of heat and drought, and that in the past operations have always been suspended during the summer months. He added that whereas in the past he has always received 3 or 4 months warning of the coming of the German firm's ships, Mr. Brown now informs him that he has no knowledge of any intention of the part of hifirm to take more in the near future. These facts are hardly compatible with the Secretary of State's proposal to supply a limited quantity of oxide per month. I therefore suggest tnat the above fact - s.aould be explained to the German Government, .and that they should be told that approximately 400 tons of the oxide remain lying on the beach which could not be ta.a ,en away by the recent steamer, and that a quantity of m^rvr.cLd.cle oxide, which Hassan estimates at oOOO ton , is lying ab the mines 1-h miles inland.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, T 0 His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Abu Musa. Please see Your telegram, dated 4th March. 1. First German pointy viz., that Salim, uncle of Sheikh Sasrar, is owner of mines, and that as lease was given by him to a company in his capacity as owner, Sagar had no right to annul it. Nothing in support of this is to be found in the papers forwarded with the German case. History of island shows that it is integral part of dominions of Sheikh of Shargah, used for grazing of livestock of ruling Sheikh and family, and Sheikh Sagar in two letters to Resident in 1884 referred to fact that Salim only resided on island on sufferance. Sagar has also continued to send his own livestock to island annually when necessary for grazing. It is a fact that by personal and verbal arrangement with Sagar, Salim has enjoyed income of Abu Musa since Sa^ar ousted him from Sheikhdom. ^ Sagar admits this and says that Salim has also been allowed by him to retain rent for mines paid under terms of contract now in question,' &amp; in order to stop Saliin's complaints as to the inadequate allowance given him by Sagar. But all right of ownership of island has now categorically been disclaimed by Salim in letter to Sagar, dated 21st February 1908, and he has declared that in granting lease he merely acted as proxy for Sagar. Examination of Agreements between Sagar and Salim, dated 1883, 1884, and 1889, respectively, support the genuineness of this declaration. They show that Salim's chief means of support was fixed stipend granted to him by Sagar, and contain no mention of his right to revenue of Abu Musa. Sheikh in a letter to Resident dated 11th October 1902, referred to fact that, while acting as Regent in Shargah, Salim had leased produce of mines. German argument on Salim's rights therefore breaks down. 2. Second German point, viz,, that even if power to grant lease emanated from Sheikh, his cancellation of it was unjustifiable. Sheikh is law to himself, and has absolute right to do as he likes subject to such general control as is exercised by us. Sheikh's territorial rights over island have been admiUed by Germans. The agreement under which Sheikh took personally a com mercial share in undertaking, was for so long as mines are workable and in lease, and nothing contained limits his right as Sheikh to cancel the lease at will under any circumstances. Sheikh's reasons for cancelling lease were good, viz., first ; grant of mono- polv to foreigner not contemplated in lease especially alter he had received a general warning from Political Resident not to grant trade monopolies without consulting him, and a special warning given m December 1904 by Residency Agent at Shargah, not to deal with Wonckhaus without reference to Resident. Secondly, monopoly had been given by Hassan Samaiyeh without the eon- sent of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, a partner, who accorflmgly CQinplamed^ to tlie Sheikh of being ignored. Pact that heading of contract 'owner and holder of concession ' was particularly objecte • Germans claim that Esa had really known and approved ® e £ contract. This is not borne out by documents forwarded by German documents now forwarded by Cox suggest that this was no ' g June 1906, deed of contract between Hassan Sajnaiyeh and German firm was executed. Under it monopoly of purchase tor o y Hassan to German firm and preference for new contract on expiry o iatif who in reporting agreement on 11th June 1906 to Esa's father, Abdul Latif, who is our Residency Agent, Shargah, concealed existence o been omitted f«»ta flgh. I it u to 'Sd from German case. In replying on 14t]i *» une » , Hassan to refrain from making leases or deeds of contrac •iff 11 iOn 26th June Malcolm, who had engagements with concessionaires, asked Hassan for a copy of the agreement, and enquired whether similar contracts could he entered into with other European firms. In replying on 13th July Hassan evaded both points. ^ Hassan in a letter, dated 14th October 1906, to Malcolm, refused to send a copy of the agreement, and said that the German had said the transaction should be kept secret. He was finally persuaded to give a copy to Residency Agent Lingah, at end of October 1906. It was not till 16th December 1906 that he sent a copy of it to Abdul Latif. On receipt of document Abdul Latif wrote on 23rd January 1907 that the contract was not agreed to by his son, Esa and desired its nullification. On 20th February Esa wrote to Sheikh Sazar asking for cancellation of the contract. In a letter to Abdul Latif, dated 8th March 1907, Hassan asserted that he had communicated details*of the agreement to Abdul Latif at time of its execution, and that Abdul Latif had then written approving. There is no evidence of either letter or reply. Maior Cox writes that he has been through Abdul Latif's correspondence and found some office copies missing or too faint to be made out, but adds that he was quite frank and gives his solemn word, which Cox has no reason to doubt that we need not fear that any letter of his of which an office copy is not 'forth coming contains anything more than appears in letters hitherto produced. It is especially important to note as regards Esa's request for cancellation that until he got text of lease he knew nothing of objectionable description of Hassan in it as ' owner and holder of concession 3. Third, Germans claim, viz., that, in any case, consent of Esa or other partners to action taken by Hassan was not necessary, as latter was managing partner on behalf of others. Evidence produced by Cox disproves this, 0 and German Consulate Dragoman went to Bunder Abbas on 25th November 1907 and apparently without success tried to induce JSejef-bin-Ali, a claimant to a' share in the concession, to sign a document agreeing to the sub-contract. 4. Wonckhaus has endeavoured to strengthen his case by securing an actual share in the original concession. The purchase of this share however does not in any way diminish the Sheikh's right to determine the lease as it was effected after the arrangements for the cancellation of the lease had been made. The purchase was clearly a mere afterthought. It affords an argument in justification of the Sheikh's action, since, by its terms, the German firm was admitted without the Sheikh's consent to a leasehold interest in the island. This was contrary to the Sheikh's assurance that he had given to the Political Resident that he would do no such thing without the knoTv ledge of the British Government. It might have led to an infringement of the Treaty of 1892. 5. Our case appears to be strong and unshaken by the German case. 6.

Quite recently the German Consul told Cox that he quite understood that the only oxide in question was that on the beach near the huts and Wonckhaus had been instructed by him not to go near the mines. It is important in Tiew of activity of Germans and interest taken by Arabs in the case to support Cox, and I recommend that only the oxide on the shore lying ready for shipment should be taken by the ship now going there, and I would instruct Cox to submit separately proposals as to oxide lying inland near the mines. To clean and get this to the shore for shipment will take some time. A d. 1. C. P. (V-lfo. 6091 r. XW27-a.lf08-10 -B.

Grey to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that Sir G. Spring-Rice recently met Herr Wonck- haus, who, in the course of conversation, alluded to the export of red oxide from the Island of Abu Musa. Herr Wonckhaus is reported to have stated that documentary evidence was in his possession to the effect that «the British Resident in the Persian Gulf had instructed the Sheikh of fehargah not to enter into an agreement with a German firm ' This statement would seem to go somewhat further than the action which was reported in Major Cox's letter of the 29th November, 1906, which forms the inclosure in your letter oi the 15th June, 1907. According to the correspondence forwarded by Major Cox, the Sheikh was warned against entering into any agreement with the German firm without previous consultation with the Resi dent. A warning^of this qualified nature differs essentially from an absolute veto such as that implied by Herr Wonckhaus, and is, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, fully justified by the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Trucial Chiefs, whose material welfare is closely bound up with the maintenance of order in the Persian Gulf, and whose means of livelihood are so slender as to render any-ill-considered arrangement of far-reaching effect. I am to inquire whether Mr. Morley is satisfied that the warning reported by Major Cox in his letter above referred to constitutes the only communication made by him in this connection before Messrs. Wonckhaus had acquired an interest in the Concession, or whether there is reason to suppose that some warning of a nature similar to that alleged by Herr W onckhaus was also con veyed to the Sheikh and has not been reported. I am further to inquire, with reference to my letter of the 28th December, whether the Government of India hare yet formulated suggestions as to the future working of the Concession on Abu Musa.

J the claims of Messrs. Wonckhaus m res pect of the cancellation by the Sheikh of Shargah of the concession for mining oxide of iron on Abu Musa Island, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to enclose copy of a telegram, from the Government of India, expressing their views on the representations of the German Government. It is understood that the reply to the German case will be prepared by the Foreign Office. The papers referred to in the telegram, which have been received by this mail from the Government of India, are therefore forwarded without detailed examination. As regards the general questions of policy involved, Mr. Morley would draw attention to the following points, (1) The references in the German case to the fact that the Sheikh was at one time a partner in the lease raise the point whether it might not be held that he was thereby precluded from denying that his uncle, Salim-bin-Snltan, who granted the lease was the owner of the mines, and had a legal right to lease them to the original lessees and that Messrs. Wonckhaus, into whose hands the Sheikh's share in the lease ultimately passed, are qua their rights as partners the assignees of the Sheikh's share.It appears to be established that Salim-bin-Sultan subsequently to his logs of the Sheikhship in 1883, was in no sense the owner of the mines ; that subse quently to the agreement arrived at in 1889 he lived at Shargah as the Sheikh's adviser; and in granting the lease he was acting merely as proxy for the Sheikh The right of the Sheikh to cancel the lease, in spite of the factthat he was at one time a partner in it, is based by the Government of India partly on the terms of • Secret e., May 1907, nos. 568-580. the agreement of • 20th August 1898 constituting his partnership, but mainly on the arbitrary nature of the sovereign powers enjoyed by the Sheikh. It is to be observed that the original concession concludes with the words—' I have perhaps made out certain agreements previous to this. They do not hold good and this agreement is to be acted on ^ (2) The argument in the German case that Hassan Samaiyeh had acted within his rights as managing partner in contracting with Messrs. Wonckhaus for the delivery of the oxide, and that the terms of the contract were known both to Abdul Latif, the representative of the British Government and his son Esa, a partner in the lease, is met by the facts stated regarding Abdul Latif s t action in the matter, and the objection f taken by Esa to Hassan Samaiyeh's pro ceedings. Strictly speaking, the question of the managing partner's powers in such a case would appear to be one to be decided according to local law.

Safar 1:!25) aDd tlle 26th •* Shaban 1325, stress is laid on the objections to a mono poly as a justification of the cancellation. It appears to Mr. Morley that a dis tinction can be drawn between a monopoly containing provisions that safe guard the Sheikh's interests, and one in such general terms as those of the cancelled lease, (4) To turn to the question of the future working of the mines, it will be seen that the Government of India concur in the suggestion in Major Coxs telegram of the 10th March that ' as soon as circumstances permit, we should introduce a trustworthy British subject or firm to the Sheikh who would manage the mining and sales on his behalf on suitable terms to be negotiated through the Residency. ' Mr. Morley would be glad to be favoured with Sir E. Grey's views on this proposal. All that seems actually necessary is that tiie new concession to be granted by the Sheikh should be in a form to s;ueguard his interests and sovereign rights in the island which the cancelled concession failed to do. The grant of a fresh concession would be in accord ance with the Sheikh's own views expressed in the concluding words of his tt Secret E, February 1908, Nos. 567-603 letter 0f the lltll tt Safar 1325 to Hassan * Samaiyeh which said: 'You are not ailoweu to take oxide of iron from Abu Musa Island on the condition which you have made unless the business is put on a footing of which we need not fear the consequences.' (5) Mr. Morley would suggest, for Sir E. Grey's consideration, that the reply to the German case should include a statement that the object of cancollmg the lease was not to interfere with the commercial interests f ^ essrs • Wonckhaus, but to maintain the soverign rights of the Sheikh o Shargah ; and that His Majesty's Government have no objection to a fresh concession being negotiated through the Resident at Bushire, and to tem porary arrangements, pending the grant of a fresh concession^to enatlg Messrs. onckhaus to fulfil their contracts, The question of these temporaty arrange ments was dealt with in my letter of the 30th March 1S08.6. The question whether compensation should not be offered as an act of grace to Messrs. Wonckhaus is one that can hardly he ignored, though no claims founded on action taken by the firm since the cancellation of the lease need presumably be entertained. Mr. Morley will be glad to be favoured with Sir E. Grey's views on the subject. He proposes to deal separately with the question of the incidence of any charge that may be incurred on this account.

It is understood that the reply to the German case will be prepared by the Foreign Office. The papers referred to in the telegram, which have been received by this mail from the Government of India, are therefore forwarded without detailed examination. As regards the general questions of policy involved, Mr. Morley would draw attention to the following points :— 1. The references in the German casef to the fact that the Sheikh was at , j ^ ,rw, xt one time a partner in the lease raise the + fecret E., February 1908, Nos . 567-603. . . . ,, i .. . i i, point whether it might not be held that he was thereby precluded from denying that his uncle, Salim-bin-Sullan, who granted the lease, was the owner of the mines, and had a legal right to lease them to the original lessees, and that Messrs. Wonckhaus, into whose hands the Sheikh's share in the lease ultimately passed, are qua their rights as part ners the assignees of the Sheikh's share. It appears to be established that Salim-bin-Sultan, subsequently to his loss of the Sheikship in 18S3, was in no sense the owner of the mines ; that, subsequently to the Agreement arrived at in 1889, he lived at Shargah as the Sheikh's adviser, and in granting the lease he was acting merely as proxy for the Sheikh. The right of the Sheikh to cancel the lease, in spite of the fact that he was at one time a partner in it, is based by the Government of India partlv on the terms of the Agreement of $ Secret E., May 1907, ^os. 56S-550. ^ August J 189S, constituting his partnership, but mainly on the arbitrary nature of the sovereign powers enjoy ed hy the Sheikh. It is to be observed that the original Concession concludes with the words : ' I have perhaps made out certain Agreements previous to this.

As regards what is said in your letter of the Sth January, as to the difficulty, in view of the action taken y \\ Ilid - Majesty's Government in the matter of the Hormuz oxide contract, of basing an argument with the^ German Gov ernment on the ground of objections to a monopoly, I am to pom ^ou 3Esa's letter to the Sheikh demanding the cancellation of the lease, and the •Secret e..

SIR EDWARD GREY was good enough to say in his Memorandum of the 10th January that His Majesty's Government did not see any objection to Mr. Wonckhaus removing the red oxide which had already been drawn, and which was ready for shipment from the Island of Abu Musa, and that His Majesty's Government would advise the Sheikh of Shargah not to disturb the shipment. Reports received at Berlin state that only part of the oxide could as yet be removed, as the German ship 'Louise,' which visited the island in April last, had only room for 1,810 tons. This quantity has been removed without disturbance from the Sheikh's men. But the following quantities of oxide drawn and ready for shipment had to be left on the island :— («.) About 400 tons left from the oxide on the beach, from which the 1,810 tons have been shipped. {b.) A somewhat large quantity in the inner island stored up near the pit where it has been won. From correspondence that took place on the 18th and 21st March last between the German Consul and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire, it appears that the British Consul-General saw at that time some objection in advising the Sheikh to allow the removal of the oxide mentioned under (&amp;.).

Wonckhaus. Major Cox reported early in May that he understood from Hassan Samaiyeh, who had been in consultation with Mr. Brown, that Messrs. Wonckhaus had no intention to make any further shipments for the next few months ; and he added that, owing to the season of the year, no serious transport operations on the island were possible for two or three months. There remain on the beach some 400 tons of oxide, and, according to the estimate of Hassan Samaiyeh, about 3,000 tons of saleable quality near the mine. These amounts are at the disposal of Messrs. Wonckhaus, and Sir E. Grey is disposed to link that it might be advisable for the local agent of the firm to give the British jsident timely notice of any further shipments, in order that arrangements may be concerted with the Sheikh of Shargah for preventing disturbances on the spot.

ON the 26th instant the writer was requested to meet the Resident, who again referred to the Abu Musa affairs at some length. Briefly the position is as follows :— That the Government has decided to allow the Germans to ship all the oxide which has been put out by Sumaya, and that the Germans are delaying the shipment of ' the balance now at Abu Musa, under the pretext of their inability to do so on account of the prevailing hot months, which render the working of coolies and lighters on the island a matter of physical impossibility, and therefore the lifting of the ore will have to be put back for about six months. There are, the Resident said, several lots of oxide on the island mined by Sumaya for the Germans, estimated at about 3,000 tons, and of this quantity certain lots have been rejected as inferior stuff by the Germans and the rest have been approved of, and these will be shipped. (Between us, as report ws, pressure must have been brought to bear by the German Government for the shipment of the balance now at Abu Musa, as the authorities originally intended to debar them from doing so.) The lots of oxide have been photographed. The Resident then asked the writer to inform you that the Government was willing to allow you to negotiate through the writer with , the Sheikh for the working of the mines, and that the Resident was anxious that mining operations should commence immediately as weather permitted, so that you might be able to ship oxide in about six months' time. The writer told the Resident that you were not now keen on taking up the Abu Musa business, and that we were consequently unable to move in the matter without reference to you. . This was a matter of surprise for Major Cox, who understood from the-b oreign Office that you were still eager to obtain the Concession of the mines at Abu Musa. Writer reiterated his previous statement, when Major Cox replied that there were other applicants m England anxious to take up the business, but that he would like to give yon the preference, specially as we, as your agents, would be better able to tieat with the Sheikh, and that he would afford us every facility in concluding a contract with the Sheikh. He further said that he would write to the Foreign Office to communicate ^ IUs now for you to decide whether you authorize us to treat with the Sheikh, in which case you should send us your full instructions or let the matter pass you altogether. Perhaps it would be false modesty not to say that others are likely to seek our assistance, whether in India or England. We asked you some time ago to let us know the quality of the oxide shipped by 'Louise.' Kindly enlighten us on the matter. , . t tt i 4. - k * t .

This officer lost no time in instituting the requisite inquiries, but owing to the absence of telegraphic communication with Shargah, and the necessity of subjecting the several documents bearing on the case to detailed examination, it has not been found possible to reply to the communica tion m question at an earlier date. The result of this examination tends clearly to establish that the statements of I fact upon which the complaint of Messrs. Wonckhaus is based are inaccurate. r oi convenience of exposition the substance of each particular count of this compJamt is set forth under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations ot ms iVIajesty s Government are subjoined in ordinary type. Copies of the documents referred to are annexed in the Appendix, m .}; The mines on Abu Musa are owned by Salim-bin-Sultan, the uncle of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah. They were leased by Salim in 1898 to a Company for a fixed yearly The Island of Abu Musa, with the mining and all other rights, is, and can be proved to be, the property of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled. This is established by a letter dated the 21st February, 1908, in which Salim-bin-Sultan categorically disclaims all right of ownership, and declares that, in granting the lease of 1898, he merely acted as proxy for the ruling Sheikh, then absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca (see Appendix, No. 1). The two men were at one time at enmity, Salim having been the_ ruling Sheikh till April 1883, when he was deposed by his nephew. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled, who has ever since been the ruling Sheikh. Relations between them now depend on an Agreement concluded in 1889 (see Appendix, No, 2). The ruling Sheikh has, ever since his uncle was deposed in April 1883, made the latter an allowance, in which, solely in virtue of oral and personal arrange ments, the revenue of the island, together with that of the mines, has been included (see Appendix, No 5), When Salim has resided on the island, he has done so only on sufferance, a circumstance which is corroborated by two letters addressed in 1884 by the ruling Sheikh to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf (see Appendix, Nos. 3 and 4), ^ The Island of Abu Musa is shown by its history, as recorded in the accompanying Memorandum (see Appendix, No. 6), to be an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Shargah, who in recent years has regularly sent his own live stock there for purposes of grazing. It thus appears that Salim did not conclude the lease of 1898 in the capacity of owner, but in that of Regent, a contention which is further supported by a letter, dated the 11th October, 1902, from the ruling Sheikh to the British Resident (see Appendix, No. 7). 2. The lease of the Company appears to be legally constituted ; this was recognized by the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, since he himself was, for a time, a partner in the Company. The use of the word ' lease ' rather obscures the true nature of the rights granted to the partners by the document of 1898 (see Appendix, No. 9), The document was [1852 k—l} B'ft } not an absolute grant to the partners of the right to mine oxide on the island for an undetermined period. It was a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time. That the partners were entitled to terminate the Concession is shown by the words, ' for such a period as they may wish to hold them,' but the only effect of 'these words is to give the partners the right to surrender the mines and escape from the liability to pay 250 dollars a-year when they please. They do not imply that the right to terminate the contract is with the partners alone' and that the owner is bound for ever, and can under no circumstances escape from the contract however valuable the mines may become. That the lessor retained the right to determine contracts of this character is shown by the penultimate paragraph of the document: I have perhaps made out certain Agreements previous to this. They do not hold good, and this Agreement is to be acted on. Tn these circumstances the lease appears to have been no more than a permit wen* these mines, determinable by notice on either side, the owners receivino- ^50 dollars a-year so long as it was in force. The action of the ruling Sheikh in becoming a partner in the concern for a few months in 1899 cannot affect his right to cancel the lease granted in his behalf no matter what complexion the Company might in future assume. Were there any question at issue as to the genuineness of the lease granted in 1898 by Salim, the fact that the bheikh had subsequently become a partner would be of importance, but as he approved the lease no such question arises, and his temporary partnership is an incident navmg no direct bearing upon the points at issue. 3. In October 1907 Hassan-hin-Ali Samaiyeh, one of the original lessors, sold his share in the Company to the British subject Thomas Brown, of Lingah, who, a few days Latei, transferred the share to the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co., of Linqah. Th* ^ompany of lessors now apparently consists of three British subjects and the German firm Wonckhaus and Co It appears that an absolutely legitimate commercial business is concerned. f a datec | 21st February, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 8), the ruling Sheikh o khargah addressed a communication to Hassan Samaiyeh withdrawing the document o ^ncession and informing him that, the contract of 1898 being terminated, he had no longer any right of enjoyment in regard to the mines on Abu Musa. In these circumstances, Messrs. Wonckhaus, if they purchased without notice of the fact that the Concession had been terminated, have been misled either by Hassan Samaiyeh or p ic intermediate vendor, Mr. Brown ; in either case, their appropriate remedy would appeal to be an action at law against the vendor for damages. ,, . y* hen. they pui chased the share in the Concession, they were already aware tnat it had come to an end, they have no cause for complaint at the actioa of the lei v i either m terminating the Concession or in enforcing his action by the removal t ^ 0m ° 1 t sland ' for tlie y bought with lull knowledge of the position. n either event, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. do not appear to have any locus standi m their capacity as partners to question the Sheikh's action. 4. In October 1907 the Sheikh sent armed men to the island, ivho expelled the miners and prevented the mines being worked. The boats with the Sheikh's armed men were towed o Abu Musa by the British man -of -war 'Lapwing;' on board of ivhich is said to have been Lieutenant Gabriel, British Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas. The Sheikh had recourse to forcible measures within his own iurisdiction in consequencf o ie persistent refusal of Hassan Samaiyeh to desist, in accordance with the oneikh s repeated injunctions, from working the mines. . A ^ the . 0 , f British subjects was in contemplation, and the British Resident ' 11 1° j ' ! i' 1 . 1 ' u \ r _ ' ( ' 0n duly notified of the Sheikh's intention, it was considered prudent that one of His Majesty's ships, with a British Consular officer on hoard, should accompany the armed force to the island, in order to prevent the use of unnecessary violence. It was probably owing to this precaution that all bloodshed and loss of life were prevented. The Sheikh's boats were towed to the island in order to insme their simultaneous arrival with His Majesty's ship ' Lapwing,' and to enable c litis i o iceis to control the action ol the Sheikh's retainers more effectively.atlei * 5. By the. forcible measures and illegal condu Urn ieen prevented from enjoying the lease granted The rights ot the Sheikh of Shargah in regard to the disposal of his own property are aoso.a.e, since, apart Eroni such general control as, in virtue of Treaty relations is exercised by the Goyernment of India, he is subject to no external control, and is bound only by such laws as he himself may decree. In the case of the particular lease or permit in question, it has already been shown that the Sheikh was entitled to determine it at his discretion. In no sense of the word does the conduct of the Sheikh appear to have been illegal. 6 ^ ai1 a permit Wllers 1%% ^ re fere ant ^ktasie 3 is 3ii kciifflt i fk h nkgU k docimei in I the men i0 iwd 6. The Company is thereby suffering losses, since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantities of iron oxide at a fixed price. In particular, the managing partner hos entei ed into a conti act dated the June, 1906, with the German merchant Herr Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah {partner in the above-mentioned firm U. Wonchhaus and Co.), to deliver certain fixed quantities for four years. There is nothing in the documents in the possession of His Majesty's Government to indicate that Hassan Samaiyeh occupied the post of managing partner, and for reasons which will appear more fully below there seems every reason to believe that Hassan Samaiyeh had no right as against his partners to enter into any such contract without their knowledge, and that, had they been aware of its terms, they would have refused their consent. It is clear that when the document was disclosed and the terms of the contract became known to the other partners they declined to approve it. The abrogation of the lease or permit has certainly rendered it impossible for either the Company in whose name Hassan contracted, or for Hassan himself, to carry out the contract. His Majesty's Government are not fully aware of the relations between Hassan and the firm of E. Wonckhaus and Co., but they recognize that it is possible that Hassan's action in making a contract which he was unable to fulfil may have rendered him liable to Messrs. Wonckhaus in substantial damages. This, however, is a matter between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hassan. 7. The informatiori in the possession of the German Government leads them to certain conclusions in regard to the motives of the Sheikh of Shargah. These motives may conveniently be discussed under two headings, (a) the objections of Esabin-Abdul Latif, one of the partners in the Company formed to work the Concession granted in 1898, and (h) the objections of the Sheikh himself, to the terms of a certain contract entered into by the aforesaid Hassan Samaiyeh with Herr Robert Wonckhaus on the 1st June, 1906. By this contract (see Appendix, No. 10) Hassan Samaiyeh, who is described as owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,' gives 'the entire monopoly of Eu Musa oxide to Kobert Wonckhaus during the terms of the contract' (saving certain small amounts duly specified), and, on the expiry of the contract, reserves to Hobert Wonckhaus the preferential right of renewal. With regard to point (a), the German Government state :— It does not appear to he the case that the contract was concluded without the agreement of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, as the managing partner, Hassan Samaiyeh, immediately on the conclusion of the contract informed Esu's father, Abdul Latif, who represented his son in all matters pertaining to the Company, and Abdul Latif approved the contract in his feply. According to a lalev letter of the father, the son appears to recognize the contract os legally valid, although he would have liked, to have seen it before its conclusion, as he describes its abrogation simply as preferable, and in a subsequent letter the father says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son. The documents referred to in the foregoing statement form Inclosuies 6, 8, and 10 in the note from the German llmbassy, but the translations of these documents in the possession of His Majesty's Government (see Appendices, ]Sos. 12, 16. and 1/) differ materiallv from those forwarded by the German Embassy, and furthei letters of considerable importance are omitted from the German case. The 1st June, 1906, was the date of execution of the deed of contract between Hassan Samaiveli and Mr. Robert Wonckhaus. When, on the 11th June, 1906 (see Appendix* No. 11), Hassan Samaiyeh reported the Agreement to Esa s father, A4 Abdul Latif, lie concealed the existence of what was virtually a monopoly and of the preferential right of renewal. In his reply, dated the 14th June (see Appendix, No. 12), Abdul Latif comments upon the transaction in guarded language, and expressly requests Hassan Samaiyeh to ' refrain from entering upon any arrange ments whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract, from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels.' On the 26th June, 1906, Mr. T. Malcolm, a British-protected subject, with whom the concessionnaires had engagements, requested Hassan Samaiyeh to furnish him with a copy of the Agreement, inquiring whether other European firms could enter into similar contracts. Both points were evaded by Hassan Samaiyeh in his reply of the 13th July (see Appendix, No. 13), in which he alleged that the original contract had been drawn up in German; and in a further letter of the 14th October (see Appendix, No. 14) to Mr. Malcolm he refused to send a copy of the Agreement, and said that secrecy of the transaction had been enjoined by Herr Bobert Wonckhaus. It was not until the 16th December, 1906 (see Appendix, No. 15), that he sent a copy of it to Abdul Latif, who, on receipt of the document, wrote on the 23rd January, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 16), to Hassan Samaiyeh stating that his son Esa did not agree to the execution of such an Agreement, which had been concluded without any consultation among the partners, such as should undoubtedly have taken place. The phrase which, in Inclosure 8 of the German case, is translated ' the cessation of this contract would be preferable to its continuance ' is more accurately rendered by ' the nullification of this contract is better than its acceptance.' This employment of the comparative is, in Arabic epistolary form, a customary euphemistic manner of expressing a definite resolution. In the present case this interpretation is confirmed by the whole tenor of the letter in question. It does not appear, as contended in the German case, that Abdul Latif definitely says in his letter of the 27th March, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 17), that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son Esa. It is clear that the main ground of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif's objection to tlie contract was that Hassan Samaiyeh, improperly describing himself in inaccurate terms as 'owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,' had, without consulting his partners, formed a contract with Herr Wonckhaus which tied the hands of the Company, not improbably for an indefinite period, in regard to practically the whole amount of red oxide excavated at the island, and bound them to sell it at a fixed price, so that they would derive no advantage from any increase in the price of oxide. It is obvious that a contract of such far-reaching import should, before being concluded, have been submitted to all the parties interested. Esa-bin-Abdul Latif has expressly denied that he gave any power of attorney to Hassan Samaiyeh, and maintains that it was incumbent upon the latter to act in regard to every trans action in communication with him, according as was agreed in the deed drawn up on the admission of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh to partnership in the Company (see , Inclosure 2 in the note from the German Embassy). If the contract had in reality been submitted to and approved by Abdul Latif on behalf of his son Esa, it is difficult to see the reason for which Herr Wonckhaus enjoined secrecy on Hassan Samaiyeh (see Appendix, No. 14). As will be seen from the accompanying Petition (see Appendix, No. 18) from Nejef, the son and heir of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, now deceased, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif is not the only partner in the Company who takes exception to the proceedings of Hassan Samaiyeh. His Majesty's Government understand that the dragoman of the German Consulate, Bushire, has been in communication with Nejef-bin-i^akhoda in regard to his attitude towards the contract of the 1st June, 1906. W ith regard to (6) (the objections of the Sheikh of Shargah himself to the contract of the 1st June, 1906), the German Government are of opinion that— The Sheikh s fear that he might lose possession of the mines and island is senseless, while the fact that there was no provision in the lease of 1898 allowing the whole export of the mines to he transferred to a foreigner without the Sheikh's approval is no more con clusive than the omission of a prohibition against such a transfer, and, in vieiv of the i ecognized, liberty of trade in the Persian Gulf, it is to be inferred that the conclusion of contracts with foreigners was within the powers of the Company. The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of his sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by5 im - the Regent in 1898 was evidently a proper and natural desire to administer iustice as between the partners of the Company and to render nugatory the unauthorized action of Hassan Sa a j . Moieovei, on learning how far the terms of the contract with Hen-K Wonckhaus went conferring as they did a preferential right of renewal for an indefinite penod, the Sheikh may well have felt that his own pecuniary interest in the mines would not, m view of the increasing market value of red oxide, be properly safeguarded by a payment limited indefinitely to a sum of 250 dollars a-year. In these circumstances tlie Sheikh would not unnaturally have deemed it advisable to protest against the contract with Herr 'Wonckhaus so soon as he became aware of its purport, rather than to allow this gentleman to acquire, with the lapse of time a vested interest m the output of the mines. The position at the present time appears to His Majesty's Government to be that Herr Robert Wonckhaus has entered into a contract with Hassan Samaiyeh, who having acted without authority from his partners, is unable to carry out his contract, and is consequently liable to Herr Wonckhaus in damages. If, therefore, further steps are taken they should be of a legal character, and it will be at the discretion of Herr Wonckhaus whether they are taken or not. His Majesty's Government appreciate' the friendly manner in which the German Government have dealt with the case, and, pending a final decision of the whole question, they are prepared to use their good offices in order that temporary arrange ments may be made whereby Messrs. Wonckhaus will be enabled to procure a limited Bnaoiint ot led oxide to place them in a position to fulfil such contracts as they may have ente red into before the cancellation of the lease. Instructions have accordingly B^TIssued to the British Eesident in the Persian Gulf to ask the local representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus to give due notice when the firm intend to resume operations in order that the necessary arrangements may be made. His Majesty's Government are, however, informed that, for climatic reasons, no serious operations are possible during the next three or four months for transporting the accumulated minerals from inland to the beach.

I WRITE to inform your honour that whereas I have come io know that Haji Hassan-hin-Ali Samayieh and the friends who advise him assert that the oxide mines which are in the Island of xAbu Musa are my personal property, and that the lease which was issued by me to Haji Hassan and his partners was given by me in my own right, and not by proxy, in your behalf. I fear that this statement may become a cause of ill-feeling between us ; I have therefore thought it necessary to apprise your honour of it, and to acquaint you with what is in my mind, namely, that I absolutely made no such claim as that which interested parties allege; and I hereby admit that when*I came before you in the presence of the British Agent on the 4th Shaaban, 1301, I had no pension or means of subsistence, and you were kind enough to place the Island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence, and you did so conditionally that [ showed loyalty and concord and obedience to you in all respects; and I am well aware that the island in question and the mines which are in it belong to your honour, and that you might at any time decide to take the island from my charge—it is at your disposition to do so, and I have no status or power to gainsay you; and when I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on your behalf, and the Concession was given by proxy for you ; ^ and I was well aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered that my action in the matter of the Concession was good, you would confirm what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable, you could annul it either at the time or at any other time ; and I altogether disapprove of the proceedings of Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samayieh in regard to this lease, and in respect of whatever action you took in this connection, that is, in cancelling the document, I was acting in accord with you, seeing that your action was taken in consultation with me and for the interests of us all, and in no respect have I any view contrary to yours; and it is in order to dispel doubt from your mind and as an evidence of my singleness of view with you that I have written this, so that you may have cognizance.

We have come to an agreement in the name of God and in all sincerity, without trickery and deceit, we the Sheikhs Salini-bin- Sultan and Sagar-bin-Khalid through the mediation of Abdul Latif-bin- Abdurrahman, the Agent of Government. What 1, Sheikh Sagar, have bound myself to do in regard to Sheikh Salim is that I will continue the payment of the pension fixed at 400 dollais pei annum, and will show him honour and complete magnanimity, and will exchange views with him in regard to matters needing consultation and expression of opinion ; and in these which are needful in our own interests, and I will not put any one's opinion before his, and he can live where lie likes—from Khan to Hijra. And what I, Sheikh Salam, have bound myself to do in regard to Sheikh Sagar is to hilhi the obligations ol docility and obedience and the display of energy in advising him in matters affecting our interests inwardly and outwardly. And if we came to know r of anything in the way of misunderstanding that might tend to cause soreness in our minds one against the other, then we will explain it to one another with a view to the removal of misunderstanding and the suppression of the efforts of the mischiefmakers and intriguers to make misunderstanding between us. And of our own wish and pleasure we have bound ourselves to the British Government to the effect that in the event of any violation on the part of either of us of what is outlined in this deed in the way of conditions, he will be worthy of being held responsible, and will accept what results to him in. the way of punishment and revenge from the aforesaid Government as a recompense for his breach. This is what was arranged and settled peaceably. We hope that God w r ill prosper the results of it between us in the direction of prosperity and happiness. Executed and written 5th Shaaban, 1306.

Previous to this I w r rote to you a letter, but received no reply. I hope nothing untoward has prevented you from doing so. You are acquainted with the arrange ments which were effected between me and Sheikh Salem, through the medium of Sheikh Hamid-bin-Abdullah and Hashar -bin-Maktoom. At present the above Sheikhs met at Shargah, and desired Salem to stand by the agreement and arrangement effected by them between me and him. But he did not wish to do so, consequently they have absolved themselves of all responsibility, and revoked their guarantee which they had tended on our behalf, and the arrangements effected between us have been dissolved. . ...... At present you are aware that Salem resides at Abu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others. Perhaps Salem may create some disturbance which may break the maritime peace. I beg therefore to request that you w T ill kindly warn Salem, and inform him that it he is desirous of living at Abu Musa, he must do so with peace, giving you as a guarantee that nothing long will be done by him which w 7 ill disturb the maritime peace. Lut should he no choose to do so, it will be your choice either to remove him from the island oi leave us to settle the matter between us; and we should not be called to an sw T er m . le event of our attacking each other. I leave the matter to your disposal. !' i ! HiNo.- 4. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Kh a lid to Resident, Persian Gidf. (After compliments.) February 14, 1884. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 2nd February,, 18S4, per Mirza Abdul Kasim, and I understand its contents to the effect that anyone attempting to break the maritime peace, whether he be Salem or any other people, shall be duly repressed. There is no doubt about this. But accordiDo- to what 1 have already said, I beg to tell you that Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah. If Salem wants to live in it and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs or disturb the maritime peace, it matters not, because I cannot dispense with the Island of Bu Musa, as it is of great use to me. I beg therefore you will plainly write to me on the subiect and inform your agent of the same. No. 5. Sheikh Sag a r-hin-Kha lid s Explanation of the Position in regard to Abu Musa, dated February 22, 1908. ^ In reference to the Island of Abu Musa, it is well known to everybody that it is the property of the Sheikhs of the Jowasim of .Oman, and on that point there is no doubt. As to the residence of my uncle in it, the facts of the matter are as explained below:— 1 • ^ 10 1 ni ( ^ en da y^ from the time of my ancestors Sheikh Sultan and others, it was leir habit m the days of spring, after a fall of rain and the sprouting of vegetation, o send their live-stock to the Island of Abu Musa for grazing, and also a number of our subjects from Shargah and Khan habitually sojourned on the island during the winter lor fishing purposes, and had houses and huts there. In the year 1300 Hiiri k, leikh Salim, who was then ruling Chief of Shargah, after sending his live-stock there as usual, went over to the island, and by the fate ordained by God the populace called upon me to become their Ruler in place of Sheikh Salim, and I accepted their call and occupied the post of the Sheikhdom. It was then open to me to expel Sheikh feanm irom Abu Musa Island, and I addressed the Resident in the Persian Gulf on 00 ^ wllicl1 must available on your records; the first was dated the i^abi-ul-Awal, 1301, and the second the 14th Rabi II, 1301, but the Resident pressed me to make a peaceable settlement so that there might be no cause for a 2v mant . imR peace. Accordingly we agreed that I would set apart for hneiKli balim a pension for his subsistence—every year 600 dollars. That settlement alter wards became void by my not being able to pay the amount fixed, and subse- quentiy a second agreement was come to between us under which I was to pay him yearly 400 dollars and also the income derived from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, av ich was expected to approach 200 dollars. This agreement also became void, and m tne year lo06 we made a third agreement with Sheikh Salim by the mediation of 1 j0veinn : ie . ^oGiat, and in view of the fact that up to this agreement no incdme had been obtainable from Sir Abu Nuair for Sheikh Salim, mention of the island was omitted and his pension remained at the previous figure of 400 dollars, but I now agreed to the return of Sheikh Salim to Shargah, and I took him into my service. cj, 10 . 1 ?', a er on m the year 1315, I went on the Mecca pilgrimage and appointed lei kh baam to act for me in the Shargah Government, and on my return Sheikh . a + im ln ^ ri ^ e( i me that he had been afforded # an opportunity, and had seen it to our interest, to lease the mines of Abu Musa to three persons subject to the British Government. 1 did not repudiate it, and saw nothing objectionable in it, and so I acqmesced in it; and seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum o j dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amoun o this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total 0 ^ la camc 111 hi m yearly might be 600 dollars as before, and over, and that no cause o soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I ave a }so utoly not given him any deed in connection with the island nor in regard to it. mines therein; ail I did was to relinquish the income to him, in the way of nancia assistance from me to him, and it was done voluntarily and at my own iscie ion. And i have not ceased in the days of spring in years when there has beenrain and licibagc to sguc I ii^c-stoclv to tlio island for grnzuig purposGs, as lias been our custom from of old ; and my flag CGasGs not to fly tliorG. ^ Such aic tlic facts of tliG mautGr, and I liavc recorded tliGiu for your information. (Signature and seal of Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid-bin-Sultan.) • No. 6. Memorandum, showing the connection of the Jowasim Clan, the Ruling Chief of Shargah, ' and Sheikh Saliin-bin-Sultan, respectively, with Ahu Musa Island, as indicated by the Archives of the Bushire Residency. More than a century and a-half ago the Chiefs of the Jowasim Clan of Arabs, at that time paramount in authority on what was known as the 'pirate coast ' of Oman, with head-quarters at lvas-el-lvhaima and Shargah, crossed over to the Persian Coast with their war craft and captured the port of Lingah and other places on the coast. There they remained in occupation for upwards of a century, one of the ruling family from Ha s-el - K b aim a, acting as Chief of the branch of the tribe which remained on the Persian Coast; having its seat of Government at Lingah, but remaining subject to the overlordship of the ruling Chief of the head-quarters of the tribe, then at Ras-el-Khaima. At that time as now practically all the islands in the Gulf were permanently or at certain seasons tenanted by Arabs tribes 4 and several of them, including Abu Musa, by the Jowasim. In the pearling season the tribal fishing-boats would have recourse to these islands for water or for refuge from stress of weather; in the spring, after rain, the various Sheikhs would send their horses and flocks for grazing, and in the winter parties of their subjects habitually sojourned in the islands for fishing purposes. Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became as it were permanent settlers there and quarrels began to arise between parties of them and their kinsmen from Oman sojourning on the islands, when their grazing interests clashed. -In order to put an end to this recurrent friction the Chiefs of the Clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to be used exclusively by different portions of the tribe. Under this understanding Abu Musa fell to the Shargah branch, and the arrangement then made has never been disturbed. While not ordinarily intervening in the internal politics of the Jowasim or other Arab tribes in Treaty relations with them, the British authorities have in practice recognized this position, and, in pursuance of their time honoured policy of maintaining the ' maritime truce,' the principles of which, as we have specifically notified to the tribes, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters, we have interfered in the present instance in so far as that when alien tribesmen from Debai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa Sir Bu Nuair Islands, they have been directed either to desist or first obtain the acquiescence of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah in their proceedings. It is true that on one or two occasions the Persian Government, apparently from ignorance or misconception of the history of these islands generally, have attempted to insinuate a claim to Abu Musa, but in 1888, when this claim was first asserted, in conjunction with a similar one in connection with Sirri, Colonel E. C. Boss,^ for eighteen years Resident in the Persian Gulf, writing to Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, on the 28th April, 1888, observed: ' The claim now put forward to the Island of Abu Musa has no justification whatever and any attempt to assert Persian authority there in a practical form would lead (.0 disturbance.' _ re • i Again in April 1904 when an over zealous Belgian Customs ofncial proceeclecl^ to the island and incontinently hauled down the Shargah flag and hoisted the Peisian emblem in its place, the Persian Government was called upon ^to^ icpaii ^ t le unwarranted affront, and a British man-of-war was sent to see that it had been done and that the Arab flag was replaced with due ceremony. Thus, as far as the Jowasim are concerned the position which existed from time immemorial has been maintained np to the present moment, and every year in the spring, when and at ter ram as fallen and vegetation made its appearance, the ruling Sheikh of Shargab and is immediate relations have been in the habit of sending their live-stock to graze on the island. ^ [1852 k—V, V10 So much for the abstract history of Abu Musa as au appanage of Shar^ah. We may now turn to the aspects brought into relief by the present misunderstandino* in connection with the grant of a Concession for mining oxide on the island. - In the year 1883, the ruling Chief of Shargah was Sheikh Salim-bin -Sultan. He had held the reins of tribal Government for about eighteen years, but his regime was a weak and unpopular one. ■ | This Sheikh had taken a particular and enterprising interest in Abu Musa and had planted some date groves and built himself a rough residence there. In the spring of 1883 he was according to his habit spending a few weeks there with/ the tribal horses and flocks and had left his nephew, Sagar-bin-Khalid, a youno- man of about 25 years of age, in charge of his head-quarters at Shargah. Among these Arab Chieftains the principle of ' might 0 is right' prevails and Sagar-bin-Khalid, finding that the majority of the tribesmen of the principalitv were tired of his uncle's rule, and ready to support himself in a couv d'etat, seized the government and proclaimed himself Sheikh on the 4th April, 1883, informing tho Resident of his action. The British authorities leave these questions of personnel to the will of the tribes concerned, and usually do no more than recognize the individual whom the sunW and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins of government; and m tins case bheikh bagar received recognition in due course. As soon as he had mide sure of his position he addressed the Resident (on the 17th May, 1883) savins lint he now proposed to expel Sheikh Salim from Abu Musa. In reply he was 'reminded that the -Residency had m former years specifically notified to the Trucial Chiefs tint the principles of the maritime truce must be hold to apply to the islands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf, and that he should consequently endeavour to arrange a peaceable settlement with his uncle. 'iian 0 e a Simultaneously Sheikh Sahm left Abu Musa for Lingah, and thence wrote to the Ttcsident asking his good offices. He in turn was advised to remain in Lin 'all (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until he could comAo an understanding with Sheikh Sagar. ai1 Being in the weaker position Salim soon came to terms and a settlemppt guaranteed by the Sheikhs of Eas-el-Khaima and Bebai was arrived at in Julv iSft'-i Salim WaS to reCeiTe a 1,ensi0R 0f 600 dollarnler annumii'S A copy of the settlement is attached.

He also promised to assign to Sheikh Salim the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring m about 200 dollars more. A document in the above sense was drawn up at a meeting at Ajman and there ratified. 'When reporting the conclusion of this Agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Sheikh Salim was at present going on a visit to Ras-el-Khaima and that his family would spend the hot weather tiiere and the winter on Abu Musa. Things went on smoothly after this for a time, but the two Sheikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and'in April 1889 our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack on Shargah. On getting wind of his uncle's intentions Sheikh Sagar, as usual, asked the advice of the ■British ^-o en t and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendlv meetino- between the two resulting in the framing of a third Agreement in supercession of the preceding ones. _s.his was to the following effect; Sheikh Sagar bound himself to pay lus now aged uncle the 400 dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within certain limits. He also offered to take Sheikh Salim into his service as Vizier or chief adviser and to consult Inm in ail matters affecting the interests oi the State. Sheikh Salini in turn under took to serve his nephew in obedience and loyalty. Ko mention was made of Sir Bu N uair in this Agreement because it had hitherto disappointed previous expectations and had not brought in anything. Ihe above has heid good and no further documentary agreement has since been necessary. On the conclusion of it Sheikh Salim came to live in Shargah as his nephew's adviser and for some years past the two have been the best of friends, so much so that when Sheikh Sagar leaves his head-quarters, which he not infrequently does, he always leaves his uncle to officiate in the Government of Shargah, as he did, for instance, on his departure for the Mecca pilgrimage in 1897-8. It was on return from the said pilgrimage in 1898 that his uncle informed him of the grant of the Abu Musa Oxide Concession; when, in view of the fact that since the reduction of his pension from GOO to 400 dollars. Sheikh Salim had always been complaining of the paucity of his income, Sheikh Sagar as an act of generosity decided to let his uncle enjoy the 250 dollars annual rent fixed for the Concession and thereby cease to have cause for further discontent. l^rom first to last, however, Sheikh Sagar's acquiescence in his uncle's enjoyment of the produce and income of the island in question, has been purely a personal and verbal arrangement which Sheikh Sagar might, at any time, have terminated had he chosen to do so. No deed whatever, according to the statements of the two Sheikhs themselves, has ever been given by Sheikh Sagar to his uncle in regard to this island.12 although the Island of Sir Abu Nuair did find mention in the second Agreement as above mentioned, dropping out again in the third and last because it had never brought in any income. Stronger proof of the status of the island could hardly be wanted than the declarations furnished by the two Sheikhs themselves. (Signed) P. Z. COX. February 28, 1908. No. 7.

Semey, Ling ah, owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession, and Mr. Robert Wonckhaus, Lingah. Hassan 0. Semey agrees to deliver to Mr. .Robert Wonckhaus, Lingah, during 4 years (four years) beginning with 1st June, 1906, every year 2,000 to 5,000 tons of ^0 cwts. oxide of iron of the Island Bu Musa, same quality as the 700 tons shipped by Mr. Robert Wonckhaus in March 1906. Mr. Eobert Wonckhaus agrees to take at least every year 2,000 tons, and if he wants so and there is sufficient good stuff on the island of which he approves up to 5,000 tons yearly. The price is fixed at 15^. 6^. (fifteen shillings and six pence) per ton of 20 cwts., usual weight conditions, freight and charge free on board steamer Bu Musa, to be weighed on board. Hassan O. Semey gives the entire monopoly of Bu Musa oxide to Robert Wonckhaus during the terms of the contract; he is not allowed to sell or dispose of otherwise any quantity of Bu Musa during the term of this contract, but it is agreed upon that Hassan is permitted to export to India for his account during this year what he has sold already to India, and which he gives as 700 tons (seven hundred) and besides that every year from 1907 about 5—6,000 bags of 1 cwt, (four thousand to five thousand). Hassan Semey has to deliver daily alongside if in bags 200 tons or in bulk 150 tons, weather permitting. Payment for every lot which is to be shipped, half the amount wdien the lot is ordered, and the other half w^hen the lot is being shipped. Advance to be paid by Mr. Robert Wonckhaus to Hassan 2,000 rupees (two thousand) whenever Hassan calls for it and receipt to be taken for it. This advance to remain with Hassan until the end of this contract. Whenever this contract comes to an end, Mr. Robert Wonckhaus has the preference for a new contract of Bu Musa contract if he desires so, at same price and conditions or at any rate at the price of other serious buyer. Alone the English text of this contract will hold good. Lingah, the 1st June, 1906. ROBERT WONCKHAUS. W. E. KIRKPATRICK. (Seal.) HASSAN-BIN-ALI SAMAIYEH and his partners.

I had previously sent you a letter via Debai. I trust it has duly reached you. As regards the agreement which w r e have made with Wonckhaus, tnc U-eiman, for the sale of red oxide, I have to tell you that we settled with him t la ons should be shipped every year, and that if we got out more than that he wou e a taker of it. I have settled the price with him at 15^. per ton, and we have to bear [1582 A—1] ^all the expenses and deliver the oxide on board the steamers. Praise be to God this is a godsend, and will make up for the past. The arrangement will continue for'four years, and I have taken from him an advance of 2,000 rupees. He has made conditions with us for the shipment of 200 or 150 tons per diem. The work begins from the 1st June, 1906, and I have written to my son Abdullah to settle his affairs (in India), at any rate, and to come and supervise the work. I have sent labourers to the island, and we shall have in any case to buv more donkeys for transportation. I hope that, once begun, the work will go on regularly. IP No. 12. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 6 of German Case.] (After compliments.) Shargah, 1324 14, 1906). I have received your former and later favours and was 'lad to hear of vour welfare. • J As to your remarks on the subject of the red oxide in regard to which God decreed that you sold it to the German Wonckhaus at 15s. per ton, and whereas it v^as ananged that you should excavate 2,000 tons per annum, all the charges to be deirayed by you, and he to receive the oxide nett. Very good; I hope it is auspicious It will be good fortune after trouble. In any case, our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think the operations cannot be regulated without him. Please, however, refrain from entering upon anv arrange- ^ ments whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will lead to complaints and claims, because this 4i will be difficult for our over-lords and they will not consent to it; and you are by s g race and will not commit any negligence or hesitation likely to entangle you, because in these days everyone is making a trap with which to entangle people. ari I hope you will not be neglectful in this regard. At any late 1 am glad to hear this news, if we are safe from this world's tricks more than before. * No. 13. Hassnn Samayieh to Mr (After compliments.) Ling ah, July 13, 1906. ^ I have received your esteemed letter dated the 26th June and perused it gladly and understood what you had stated. - understood 1 ^ acknowled ^ ed recei pt of my letter the contents of which you had -p f re o a ^ ds sa ^ e the German, it is satisfactory, and I hope it will be or tuna te. You had understood the details regarding the sale, shipment, and boat- mre, but you did not let me know about the commission; is it to be charged bv us rom them or by them irom us ? You had written that I should send vou a copy of ie agreement. Aery well, but the agreement has been written in German, and re is no one with us who can write such a hand. The purport of the agreement is accurately the same as I have written to you. You had written to me whether we had contracted with the German for 2,000 tons per annum 1 es, we have contracted with him that the quantity should be 2,000 tons ci cast, and lie can according to the aareement take any more quantities which we may be able to obtain from the mines. 1 on had written whether we can obtain more than this quantitv, and if so, t T ie 101 ^5 can c on tract with other Europeans, so that you may negotiate with them. » ® 1S 00 j* 8 ' I cannot give the accurate quantity unless the mine is worked for two or three months when I will be able to form an idea, 3% lif+i / ^ forty-five workmen to the island in the beginning of June, but G i^ 0 - 1 v 1 i S ^ summer and the days being hot. If more than 2,000 tons o ) aniec, ie German is bound to take it from us. We can therefore make no otner contract.15 1 beg also to inform you that iny son Abduila lias sold about 400 tons more or less at Calcutta. Only the freight is to be paid by us, every maund will be 1 r. 9 a. delivery at Calcutta. I have been trying to procure a vessel since a long time. I have now-a-days chartered ' Alimghir,' the vessel belonging to the sons of Khoja (to ship red oxide) at 10 rupees per ton. It is now several days that she has gone to the island to ship (the oxide). Thank God my son Abdulla has freed himself from the dispute at Calcutta. He has compromised with them. He has come to Bombay, and I will receive his letter from Bombay by this mail, if God pleases. I hope he will not be detained there, and that he will settle his case with Jeita Bania and come to our parts soon. No. 14. Hassan Sainayieh to Mr. T. Malcolm. (Translation.) Lingah, 23rd Shaban, 1324 [October 14, 1906). I have received your letter dated the 20th December, 1906, and was glad to hear of your well-being. I have understood what you stated. Regarding my son Abdulla, I beg to say that after settling the case at Calcutta he has arrived at Bombay, where he has some easy matters to settle with the Bania. He will settle his account and will leave for our parts in two or one and a-half months. You had remarked that you had asked some one in the post-office to take from me a copy of the document, which is in German. Let it not be hidden from you that the German, when the bargain was concluded with him, said to me that this transaction should be kept secret (' Yekoon Mastoor '), and so I did not wish that any outsider should come to know of it, and I fear that if news of the copying of the document reaches his ears he will be annoyed. In truth, it is not my intention that anyone should come to know about it except myself and you. What you wanted, namely, the details of the sale which had taken place, I have already communicated to you in a previous letter. Procedure will be according to that letter, neither more nor less, in pursuance of what is written in the document. No. 15. Hassan Samayieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) Lingah, 21 th Shawwal, 1324 [December 16, 1906). I wrote to you previously. I hope the letter reached you, and that you are well. Now I forward, inclosed in this letter, a copy of the Agreement regarding the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus, a copy made according to the original. Please acknow ledge receipt. Our news is quiet. I have nothing deserving of mention except to say all well. , . p x a Inshallah, in these days we expect Abdullah to arrive Bombay m safety, and on bis arrival I will apprise you. No. 16. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 8 of German Case.] (After compliments.) 8£/i Zilhijjah, lS24i (January 2S, 1907). I have received your esteemed letter and understood what you stated. ave understood the copy of the Agreement concluded by you with the German for the bale or the Abu Musa red oxide. My son Esa does not agree to the execution of an Agreemen to this effect, and you had neither consulted with, nor referred to him, nor did you sen him a copy of the Agreement before the settlement with the German of the a air concerning the-red oxide, so that views might be exchanged bet v. cen you 301, an that you mightadopt a recognized, obvious, and evident coulee, ecause i is 00 for the partners not to undertake a matter except after a genera consensus o i ? [1852 /c—1]16 so that no difficulties may occur, and you have undertaken this affair without any consultation. Therefore, my son Esa does not agree to the Agreement concluded between you and the German, because he fears difficulty will result from foreigners concernino- themselves in the matter. The nullification of this Agreement is better than its acceptance. — 1 liail ' lM ' ' mtwtmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmt You had previously received a letter (from me) saying that you should not involve yourself into difficulties with the German in regard to the red oxide, because he (Esa) fears an untoward result. I communicate to you what my son Esa says. No. 17. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 10 of German Case.] (After compliments.) 12th Safar, 1325 (March 27, 1907). Your esteemed letter has reached me in due course, and I have noted its contents. TV hen your communication reached me saying that you had sold to the German before mentioned oxide from Abu Musa, every year 2,000 tons of oxide at 15^. per ton, I sent you back an answer, dated the 2]st Eabi II, 1324, which purported to convey acquiescence, but in the course of the same letter I cautioned you against entering into any agreement in the nature of a leasehold or into any relation likely to result in dispute, on the grounds that the overlords of our affairs would not agree to it. I asked you to give us immunity against the complications of the world (time). My letter in question is no doubt with you. Since writing it I have never received from you the copy of the deed of agreement existing between you and the German until the 5th Zilkaadeh, 1324, when it came in English after I had asked you for it time after time. I mentioned its arrival to you in my letter of the 6th Zilkaadeh, 1324. And when we got a translator and translated the English document, it became plain to us that you had launched yourself into the very thing against which we had cautioned you and had tied yourself up by giving a lease. Consequently, my son Esa does not agree to this document which does not leave you any power of control or modification in regard to tne oxide mines of Abu Musa. And previous to this present communication I communicated to you in my letter dated 8th Zilhijjeh a translation of the deed for your information and said that you would perceive that the question was not one of mere sale as stated by you, but one of leasehold, against which I had warned you. Moreover, Sheikh Sagar does not agree to the lease of the oxide to outsiders from foreign Powers and claims that the agreement (with him) was that you should do the work yourselves and not farm it out. This is what had to be explained. No. 18. Hough purport of a Petition from Nejef-bin-Ali, Persian subject, of Bunder Abbas, to Lieutenant Gabriel, dated February 16, 1908. (After compliments.) My father for some years performed service for the British, and as Haji Hassan- bin-Ali Samayieh, of Lingah, is a British subject, I therefore petition to you as follows :— Concerning the Abu Musa oxide, for which there were four concessionnaires, among whom I hold the deed of partnership of my father. My father had no other heir but myself, and therefore after his death Haji Hassan-bin-Ali acknowledged my right of partnership as acquired through my father. At the time when Hassan entered into the agreement with Messrs. Wonckhaus he gave me no information what ever on the subject. Subsequently I made an arrangement with Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar to sell him oxide and sent word to Hassan to this eifect. Hassan then wrote me that he had made a contract elsewhere, and would inform me regarding it later. As proof that I did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan, I point to the fact that it did not bear my signature, and when, some months later, Abdullah -bin-Hassan17 and the German Munshi came and asked me to sign it in token of assent, I refused to do so, as I had not been consulted m the first place. As further proof of mv riffht in the Concession I may mention that in 1904 Abdullah-bin-Hassan had a case in Calcutta against Messrs. Sassoon concerning the Abu Musa oxide, but seeing that the oxKle had been sold m the name of my father, the case could not be proceeded with until I had furnished a power of attorney for the Calcutta Court~a copy of this is doubtless on your Consulate records. (Note by His Britannic Maiesty's Consul ■ The Consulate fee-book shows that Nejef paid 5 5 . fees for the execution of a power of attorney on the 29th October, 1904.) Now I complain that from the time that Hassan has been actively engaged in the oxide work of Bu Musa, I have not received 1 dinar of the proceeds, although all the work on the island formerly devolved upon my father, who himself found the implements, &amp;c., for working' the oxide, which implements are even now at the island. Besides all this, there were 250 carpets which belonged to my father and which were sent to Calcutta for sale. Abdullah-bin-Hassan wanted to settle up the account for them in Calcutta, but until I gave a power of attorney they would not settle with Mm. Hassan subsequently collected all the money, but I have never been able to recover any of it from him. I^ow I pray you of your goodness to look after my rights and to obtain me justice against Hassan. oIon fidential) Mo • 13 • A copy of the foregoing communication is forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for information with reference to the correspondence ending with his telegram Ho. 51, dated the 25th August 19C8, 3y order, etc..

India Office, 9th Sex^t ember 1908. Sir, In continuation of previous correspondence ending with your letter No.24404, dated the 23rd July last, as to the situation at Abu 3'usa, I am directed by the Secretary of State lor India to enclose, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Government of India, together with subsequent telegrajjhic correspondence on the subject. To the proposal to defer for the present the institu tion of suits by Esa bin Abdul Lat if and Nejef bin Ali against Hassan Samaiyeh and to leave it to the Resident's discretion whether to advise Esa and Najef to apply to Hassan for a statement of the accounts Viscount Morley sees no objection, and he is prepared, if Sir E.Grey concurs in this view to send immediate instructions to the Government cf India to that effect . There remains the question of the renewal of mining operations on the island. The present x^osition is that H.M.Government are pledged by their communication to the German Gove_^rnment , dated 10th July last ,o use their p:oo d offices in order that temporary arrangements may ... wm^mo , J I *' : ^ be made whereby Messrs Wonckhaus will be enabled t 0 procure a limited amount of red oxide to place them in a position to fulfil such contrnots the/ may have entered into 'before the cancellation of the lease'. The nature m*mmm 'wmmm of these temporary arrangements has not, however, so far been determined with precision. One of the suggested alternatives is to ascertain fro? - Messrs Strick or some other British firm whether they would 'be prepared to take charge of the mining and selling operations on the Sheikh^ hehalf, 'but the question arises whether it is desirable to take steps in that direction while the matters at issue between the British and German Governments are still unsettled. It is not perhaps likely that the settlement will be concluded at any very early date. y The other alternative i^i the plan put forward by the Resident for one of the Sheikh's brothers to take in hand the work of e: cavat ion / H.M.Government providing a guaran teeing working expenses and reimbursing themselves when the mineral is sold. The Government of India regard the proposal with some misgiving which Lord Morley is disposed to regard as justified. The transport to the sea coast of the mineral excavated would apparently be for the firm of Messrs Wonckhaus themselves to arrange. LordLord Morley would be glad to learn the views of Sir Edward Grey.

Y is willing to take on the job either to assist Residency being guaranteed against loss or as a speculation paying increased % annua± rate to ana. taking proceeds. X says that most of gear etc is not much good and A will demand exorbitant prices, he thinks it will be better to get new things. 2 or 3 bullock carts are necessary. Shall Ije see if Lawrence can bring them up from Bombay. X is quite friendly with h, but does not recommend working with him, as he could do nothing himself and would either have to agpxnt appoint an agent or rely entirely on Y. X says latter can arrange so that there will be no interruption of work when K finishes. Trevor. Sent. JB. M •From Telegram Oox C/o A.S, Trevor C/o A.S. Bushire Dated IStli October 1908. Guarantee arrangement commends itself to me most if amount is not great.Uhen I should simply inform B that this temporary arrangement had been made by Residency for him pending settlement of question. It is necessary how- ever to know abouwhat sum quarantine would involve. Please ask X to estimate .firstly .number of diggers which it will be necessary to employ and amount of their monthly pay.Secondly. Pro bable cost of gear. Thirdly. Any other contin gent expense . Coc A.SX Telegram. From Trevor c/o A.S. Bushire. To fiesident c/o A.S. Shiraz. Words 144. Lated 16th October 1908. ^cui cixit received yesterday eveuiiig. Have dis cussed question with X who worked out estimates etc. y/e think that initial expenditure on tools, huts, lighters, carts and animals of some 5000 rupees would be incurred and a recurring expenditiiire of some 840 per mensem while digging is going on. This estimate is based on having 40 diggers with sufficient gear for ohem. uost of diggers estimated at 520 i.e. at 13 rupees per mensem each paid part in kind and part in cash, Besides there will be 2 overseers and 2 bhisties bringing total up to nearly 600 . There is also hire of one sailing boat to ply from Lingah. Against this one would have to set off sale of output which we cannot estimate as no data. or/?.•1 r From To Telegram Cox G/o A.S. Trevor C/o A.S. Busliire Dated 17t]i October 1908 four chit of yesterday.Sstimates seems excessive gear and huts at present in existence cannot have cost anything like 5000 and I think wre have reported one authority of x that about 15 diggers ordinarily employed. Please see if ^Soimate cannot be reduced. Do you think after paying expenses 10 per cent on profits would be fair amount for us to award y for his trouble Badr can reourn by Wednesday's steamer.Telegram. To Resident Shiraz. Dated 18th October 1908. xoUi. onlt Ox yesterday. In one letter we have suggested -0 diggej^s. The number is a question oj* expediency. As we shall have to hire sailing craft at about 250 a month while digging is going on, it seems better to have more diggers and get large quantity of stuff in short time. He estimate half total is for 6 small lighters which will not be required till stuff has to be shipped. Possibly when A sees we are in earnest he may sell his cheap. Estimate for huts is only 260 rupees. Transport estimated at 1500 for 4 carts and bullocks and donkeys. This could be reduced if 2 bullock carts are considered sufficient. 1 thirux we might give Y rather more perhaps another to enable him to give percentage of profits to his overseer and tindals to make them buck up. i Trevor.

Regarding other matter will write final de-' cision to Badr as soon as arrived, meanwhile silence and inaction on his part are necessary Cox. Instructions given accordingly to Agha Bedr who will leave by tomorrow 1 s mail. A. P. T. 20/10.ill# Telegram. P. ' A\Foreign No. 136 Shiraz dated 19-10-08. Abu Musa. Reference your telegram No. 3.601 dated Oct 6tli. Hassan Samaiyeh,the concessionaire,will resume the removal of the oxide already mined at the end of Ramzan. Its removal will occupy about three months,and Hassan's connection with Abu Musa will then cease. In the meantime the brother of the Residency Agent Lingah is ready to carry on mining operations either on a contract with the Shei]ch,or as a temporary arrangment, being guaranteed against loss by us. The latter alter 1 native is in my opinion preferable,but I will submit de tailed proposals by telegram on my return to Bushire./9 ' e l ; ated 18th : oven' er 1908. To 'he Residency Agent, Lln-mh.

The first begins with the first letter and runs from number 1 through to number 55. There follows a gap of one folio, and then a second foliation sequence starts on the verso side of what would have been number 56 in the first foliation sequence. This sequence is inconsistent in that it is paginated from number 56 up to number 109, where it then lapses back into foliation and runs through to number 332, the last typescript folio. The third and most recent foliation sequence begins on the first typescript folio, which is loose. It runs from number 1 through to number 281, which is the inside of the back cover. It should be noted that folio 60 in this sequence is followed by folio 60 A, which is then followed by number 61. The first foliation sequence is written in blue and red crayon, in the top right corner of each folio. The second foliation sequence (which contains some pagination) is written in pencil, in the top right corner of each folio (and in the top left corner of the verso side of those folios that are paginated). The third foliation sequence, which should be used for cataloguing, is written and circled in pencil, in the top right corner of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence concerning Abu Musa island.
