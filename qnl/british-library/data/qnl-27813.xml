DISCARDING THE VEIL IN PQRTB. ^ im}L&amp; 1. It is reported that in pursuance of the discarding of the veil and emancipation of woman, the Amnieh Guards on Hindarabi Island (25 miles north of Lingah) tried to force the female population to discard their veils and shrouds, but as the Islanders are orthodox Muslims (of the Sunni Sect) they arrested the guards with the Mudir of the Customs, bound them hand and foot, kept them in confinement and then emigrated to the Oman - Muscat territory. Their number is said to be some 300 souls. 2. Another reoort states that in Tumbak, Kushkonar, and Mialu, small towns in the Shib-Kuh region, an Amnieh officer shaved the beards of some 30 greybeards, Mullahs and Qadhies there by way of enforcing the westernization reforms which have been adopted from the beginning of the current year. This measure being heretical in the opinion of the neople of the towns most of them left their homes and established themselves in Bahrain, Muscat territory and the Trucial Oman Coast.ft ' GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. | J ^ a Department. , . _ Confident ial , \ i ^ EXPRESS LETTER ^ [N.B •—This is an ORIGIN AL message sent by AIR MAIL which provides a means of communication more , expeditious than the ordinary maU and is cheaper than the telegraph.

Your telegram No. 8. We cannot trace any doctor of that name in diplomatic service nor throw any light on the report. 2. I am uncertain as to procedure by which Persians normally visit the Trucial Coast. Foreign Office circular of 10th March, 1932, states that foreigners require entry visas. As regards Persians I believe that friends or relations on the coast sometimes obtain permit for their visitor through the Resident Agent. But the large immigration last October suggests that visa is not always insisted on. 3. If Political Agent, Bahrain, instructs Sheikhs that the two men should not be allowed to land, is there not risk that in complying, Sheikhs will add that they are acting on British instructions? Contrast with October could not pass unnoticed and our consular officials on Persian coast may even find themselves accused of having engineered the emigration. This risk would be avoided if mission had fair field for failure. 4. I agree that alleged object of visit is unobjectionable as far as concerns us, and from Tehran point of view would /Hi preferprefer forbearance in this case for citation on soiie future occasion or negotiation. But I realise that I am inadequately informed as to strictness with which visa is insisted on, and unable to estimate effect on Arabs locally of a blind eye policy in this case. 5. If entry is refused Iranian Government could represent with some apparent justice that malcontents from Iran are freely permitted to enter whilst obstacles are placed in the way of Iranian officials. An accusation of this kind would be difficult to deal with and I suggest that having ignored the irregularity in one case we are in a bad position for now insisting on strict compliance with the regulations.” Ends.
