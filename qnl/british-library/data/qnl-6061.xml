Controlling clauses in draft Agreement Kuwait Oil Company. I understood from para No.6 of Dickson’s Express Lett / I April 24th that Shaikh merely feared effect publicity. Alternatives in my telegram No.1172 were designed to meet (difficulty?) which I should have thou^it would be entirely overcome, at any rate by alternative in paragraph 4 of that telegram, since separate agreement there suggested, would be kept entirely secret. I should be glad if you could (explain?) ■ more fhlly Shaikh’s present attitude if he has shifted his gro und. 2. Shaikh may be under some misapprehension as to Clause 20, purpose of which is merely to remove technical inconsistencies between commercial and political Agreement. For example Clauses 14, 8, 5(a) and 4 5(b) 6f original draft commercial agreement are affected by articles 2, 3 (second sub paragraph) 6 and 7 respectively of Political Agreement. Last two cases provide safeguards to Shaikh. 3. Clause 11 A(d) gives Shaikh (obvious?) power to terminate agreement in circumstances not otherwise provided. It is clear this would fall to ground unless agreed to in some form by Company. 4. Alternative procedure now suggested by Shaikh does not seem adequate, as suggestion stands, since letter from Political Agent would clearly not bind Company. If however Shaikh prefers that control clauses should be covered by i i exchange of letters instead of by separate agreement, we might consider adopting following procedure: Company to address Shaikh and Political Resident identical letters on lines which j you have drafted, indicating sanction’s accepted clauses.2 Shaikh would acknowledge Company’s letter and inform Political Resident that he had done so, stating, if possible, at the same time that he has cognisance of, and has concurred Political Agreement. 5. I have not yet put this suggestion to Company, nor consulted (£ovt ?) departments concerned, but I should other ’ be glad if you would telegraph at once whether you think it would meet case th (in case they?) prepared to adopt it. 6. As regards chief local representative, I hope Shaikh will agree on one of formulas suggested in paragraph No.5 of my telegram 11 in favour of an, or some similar formula.

Usual Ending.CONFIDENTIAL. EXPRESS LET TER. From To Political, Kuwait. Brit consul, Bush ire. Ko.C~205. Dated Kuwait, the 31st May 1934. It: . ' /'&gt; • 1 Reference my telegram No*195 of 28th May and paragraph 4. Chief Local Representative. ^ 2. I saw the Shaikh this morning and approached him on lines proposed in paras# 3 and 4 of Secretary of State for India’s telegran No.1321 of May 19th. (showing him relevant extracts in English and Arabic to make my points)« 3. The Shaikh at first took up his old stand about himself having the right to designate the Chief Local Representative in the first place, and His Majesty’s Government having the right to veto his selection, and he pressed me to say why His Majesty’s Government concerned themselves when clearly the matter was one ' A o V (r€A between himself and the Company alone. 4. In reply I showed him para 4 (in llhiglish and Arabic) of the Political Agreement, the wording of which clearly required the Company to designate the Chief Local Representative themselves, and get the approval of His Majesty’s Government afterwards. I pointed out that Article 4 made it impossible for either the Company or His Majesty’s Government to permit him (the Shaikh) to designate the Chief Local Representative himself. 5. My argument seemed at long last to impress the Shaikh (who I really do not think has ever properly readread the Political Agreement) for after some further arguments he proposed the following 'formula” or 'doorway' as he called it, for settling the matter to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Grovemment and the Company: (a) The Company’s Representatives to visit him and show him para 4 of the Political Agreement, confidential copies of which they and he already possessed. (b) The Company’s Representatives, next to inform him that it quite impossible for them to agree to his (Shaikh’s) selecting the Chief Local Representative, as he apparently widaed to do, as such action would be tantamount to their breaking their Agreement with His Majesty’s G-ovemment of March 5th. (c) His Excel3.ency (the Shaikh) would see and agree to this, and both he and the Company’s Representatives would then set to work to draw up a formula based on Article 4 of the Political Agreement, or possibly in almost the saras words, for insertion as Article 6(A) of the Commercial Agreement. ^ ^ ^^ 6. The Shaikh himself pointed out that he had already officially ^intimated his approval of the Political Agreement, and ipso facto of Article 4 to me in writing on 15th April 1954, so could use this fact as a 'face saver' with the Company’s Representatives^ , / 7. As the Shaikh has also signified his approval of the contents of the draft letter (especially para 3(b)], sent out under Secretary of State for India’s telegram No. 1322 of 19th May, later delivered to the Shaikh officially by me, (See my telegram No. 195^ of 28th May) it seems to me that the question of the Chief Local representative has practically settled itself, and thatand that the Shaikh also now appreciates this. 8. For formalities’ sake however he would like the Company’s representatives (negotiators) to face him with para 4 of the Political Agreement, as suggested by him above, so that he can withdraw froa his former position in graceful manner under scene such excuse as 'If you had showed me this para before and pointed out your awkward predicament, I, of course, would net have taken the line I did'. It is once again, I fear a case of pride and 'Amour propre' with him* 9. Though the shaikh’s plan is somewhat cumbers erne, I suggest it be acted upon, especially as it comes from him, and promises success. I suggest therefore that the Company’s representatives (Holmes and Chisholm) be immediately told to go ahead on the lines proposed. I could do this myself if you see no objection. 10. It is necessary that we should act quickly, I think, as the Shaikh told me that he definitely proposed infoiming Holmes and Chisholm on Saturday 2nd June that unless they could agree to his Commercial terras within the next 10 days, he did not want to see them again till the end of the hot weather, and that the best thing they could do was to go home to London and report the situation. (I see Holmes’ hand, in this), and on the excuse that the weather was too hot for woik, he (the Shaikh) would 'give them his word' not to listen to any other competitors until they returned in the Autumn.

The coniiaential letter would textually embody Clauses llA(d) and 20 of the Commercial Agreement ana would in addition contain Clause 12B(a) of that Agreement from 'all land granted' down to ' &amp; ooa order and repair', prefaced by the words 'It is understood that in the event of the agreement between Your Excellency’s Government and the Company being terminated thereby'. (As we understand it, the object of the proposed inclusion of this portion of Clause 123(a) is to cover the position ox tne lands? buildings ana other immovable property of the Company in the event of the determination of tne a 6 reement unaer the provisions of Clause llr,(a)0 The letter would further aliuae to the fact tnat the sneikh haa agreed verbally to its contents ana ask for written confirmation of this, and would refer to the fact that it was open to His majesty’s Government to &amp; ive a copy confidentially to the Company. 3. His Majesty's Government are anxious so far as possible to meet the sheikn ona as notning is involved in the substance oi the proposed exenange oi letters in which the Company have not already expressed their concurrence, they assume that the Company for their part will see no difficulty in concurring in it. On the other hand? as will he observed? the mere despatch by tne Political .agent to the sheikh of a letter such as His/5/ Piis excellency su^^esloj u copy ol wnicn would, subsequently be communicated to the Company, would not necessarily bind the Company; and His majesty's Government are naturally anxious to have this point covered beyond question. His majesty s Lroveinment su^ses.t in tuese circuinstances tnat tne oe^t course would oe, ix the Company agree, tnat tne Company, in reply to the present letter, should officially intimate their concurrence in the despatch by the Political Agent to the sheikh of a letter in the terms of the draft enclosed and their formal readiness to accept as binding on the Company the contents of such a letter. The draft varies slightly from that proposed by the Sheikh, notably in specifically relatin 6 one extract from Clause 13B(a) to tne circumstances covered by Clause llA(h), in intimating that the Company concur in the statements made in it, and in offering to obtain a reaffirmation of that concurrence on receipt of His excellency's reply, in the event of the Company accepting this suggestion instructions would be sent to the political Aoent on receipt of their formal reply, authorising him to make a communication to the Sheikh in the terms of the draft enclosed. Copies of the correspondence exchanged between the Political A &amp; ent and the Sheikh would on receipt be communicated officially to tne Company, when the Company’ would reply acknowledging and reaffirming its previous acceptance, mat reaffirmation would then be officially communicated to the Sheikh by His majesty's Government. The effect of the correspondence taken as a whole would be tantamount to tne inclusion of the Clauses in the Commercial Agreement and equally binding on the Company.- 4 - 5, It will te appreciated that the Political Agent, on receipt of the draft enclosed, or after discussion with the Sheikh, may wish to suggest alterations in it. In the event of any material alteration being proposed the consent of the Company would, of course, he obtained before the actual communication was made to the Sheikh. 6.

MJr own opinion is that difficulties which both Kuwait Oil Company and we h^ve had with Sheikh are largely due to Holmes who has probably been working with Shaikh on behalf of himself (to become for instance Shaikh’s Director in London or .•hief Local r.epresentatiTe in Kuwait), and on behalf of Eastern and General Syndicate or Arabian Development Syndicate to enter ileutral Sone.

Dear Laithwaite, I apologise for the oversight in not thanking you before now for youiyfetter of the 1st June, under reference p.Z.3653/34, relative to the recent position in Koweit. We are glad to learn that the shaikh has accepted the exchange of letters proposed, ana have taken note of his stipulation. We likewise find no objection in the Shaikh's stipulations, and we shall be prepared when asked officially by you to ao so to give an assurance of the nature he suggests. The assurance which we can give will be that as far as the Company is concerned the contents of the letter shall be kept separate ana not attached to the Concession proper, ana that the letter shall not be published by the Company. It is obvious that we can give no effective guarantee against leakage, since only a few of the possible points oi leakage are within our control. It is of course in no way in the interests of the Kuwait Oil Company that the terms of the letter or even its existence should be publishea. Yours sincerely, (3d.) L. LEFBOY. P&gt;3 . As I informed you on the telephone this morning, we have heard from our negotiators in Koweit that the Shaikh has intimated to them that unless we are prepared to accept Draft 4 (of which I left you a copy) in toto, he does not wish to continue discussions at present, but wishes them postponed until next September or a later convenient date • pending a renewal of discussions the Shaikh has said that he will not entertain or discuss any offers from other parties, and he wishes the negotiators to return to London to explain verbally and more successfully to us his point of view. In these circumstances we are instructing the negotiators to return to London, after writing a letter to the shaikh agreeing to suspend discussions in accordance with his wishes ana nis undertaking not to negotiate with others in the meanwhile.INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

They were anxious to ascertain whether any further report had been received from Koweit, and to consult us on certain developments reported hy their own representatives. 2. The Company were informed that we had had no report as yet from Colonel Dickson as to the sheikh’s reaction to the letter which the Political Agent had been instructed to despatch to him in our telegram of 19th fey, No.1321. There seemed, however, no reason to draw any adverse inference from this fact. The letter would take time to translate and it would probably be unwise to rush the discussion of matters such as it dealt with. The Company agreed. 3. Asked whether they on their side had any information to give, the Company’s representatives stated that they had received from their representatives a copy of a draft (now attached) which had, without authorisation from the Company, been submitted to the Sheikh, and which embodied certain alterations, some of which were unacceptable to the Company. In particular the revise included a redraft of Article 6 on the subject of the Chief Local Representative, which was not only unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Company, but which, so far as H.M.G. were concerned, included a provision that the selection and the appointment of the Chief Local Representative should rest entirely with the Sheikh in consultation with H.M.G. The negotiators had reported that they had embodied this redraft in the draft Agreement in the light of a statement by the Sheikh that it represented what had been agreed between him and H.M.G. (through/ CQNffIDLNTiAL . INDIA OFF I CL . P.Z.3620/34.^ - (through the Resident). They admitted that the Political Agent had informed them that no decision had yet been reached, hut felt that they had no option hut to accept the Sheikh’s statement. 4. Sir Louis Kershaw expressed great surprise that the Company's representatives should have committed themselves in any way to a proposition of this nature. The Company were not concerned with the political aspects of this question, hut solely with the commercial aspects. The position of H.M.G. in regard to the selection and appointment of the Chief Local Representative had already been made quite clear to the Company; and we had informed Colonel Dickson on 19th Ivay that we could not agree to relax our requirements on this point. We would consult the -Sheikh and give him every opportunity of making any observations that occurred to him, hut the last word must rest with H.M.G. A clause of the nature suggested was not only open to the strongest objections from the standpoint of hut appeared also to he objection able from the point of view of the company. The Company's representatives expressed entire agreement. 5. The Company's representatives went on to say that Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm had strongly urged that they should he allowed to return to London to discuss matters. The psychological effect on the sheikh would he good, and even if the Company could make no further concession, His Excellency would feel that no stone had been left unturned. They were anxious to know v/hat we thought of this. They were informed in reply that on the face of it there seemed nothing to he gained, on the assumption that no further concessions were to he made’* by a/ 1 i30th May 1934. J.G.

They said that that had been their own view, and after further discussion it was understood that they would make it clear to Major Holmes and Mr, Chisholm that the Company could not agree to a special visit to London, and that they considered that the commercial negotiations should he disposed of with the. minimum of delay as soon as the political points (which were solely matters between and the Sheikh)had been settled. It is understood that Mr, Stevens and Mr. Lefroy might, in the event of the political difficulties being removed but no conclusion appearing possible to the commercial negotiations, consider visiting Koweit themselves. They did not, however, propose to indicate this to their representatives.INDIA OFFICE, P Z- 3y LONDON, f/b Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

Mr. Lefroy informed me on the telephone on 6th June that the Kuwait Oil Company have now heen informed hy their representatives tnat a deadlock: appears to have heen reached with the sheikh. The negotiators informed the Sheikh, on the instructions of the Company, that the Company were unahle to accept the revised Draft No•4, P referred to in the Note of an interview with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Lefroy of 28th Play (P.Z.3620/34), in its existing form, though the modifications involved were such as they hoped His Excellency would see no objection to accepting. The Sheikh in reply stated that he was not prepared to have any further discussion and that unless the Company would agree to accept the draft exactly as it stood the matter must lapse. He was much occupied with other affairs and would prefer to intermit the discussions until after the hot weather ana resume them in September. Meanwhile, the Company's negotiators could return to London and inform their principals of his point of view, which he was not satisfied had been fully put before them, with a view to the resumption of discussions. Pending their resumption he would agree not to entertain overtures from any other Quarter or to give any other concession. 2o The Company in these circumstances saw little option but to recall Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm for discussion, as proposed, but were considering the matter further. 8, 3 , Mr.- Lefroy subsequently intimuted in his letter of 6 th June, of which copies have been circulated to the interested Departments, that the Company were instructing their negotiators to return to London, after writing a letter to the Sheikh agreeing to suspend discussions in accordance with his wishes and his undertaking not to negotiate with others in the meanwhile. On receipt of this letter I asked the Company to suspend any decision on this point until they heard further from us* We had consulted the political authorities in the Gulf urgently as to the position in regard to the difficulty which had arisen over the method of appointment of the Chief Local Representative ana would like to await their reply. Mr. Kemp informed me that the difficulty over the Chief Local Representative was not the only one. The Company took a very serious view of the revised demands now put forward by the sheikh in regard to the computation of royalty (paragraph 3 ) which, if accepted, might result for an increase of some 2,0% in their royalty payments. They also regarded the revised provisions in the matter of the Sheikh's representative in London as quite unacceptable. in the Company's being liable in certain circumstances J.G.

When recalling Holmes to London the Kuwait Oil Company had stated in a long telegram showed me by Chisholm that they considered their representatives here were not putting their case to the Shaikh quite as they wanted and they felt if they got Holmes back and cleared up from their point of view various points about which there a'peared a lack of understanding , that Holmes could return quickly to Kuwait and approach the Shaikh once more. Chisholm meanwhile would remain here so as to keep the negotiations still in existence. 4. Chisholm replied to this telegram by another equally long, the gist of which was that further negotiations on the latest terms offered by the Company were for the present of no use. The Shaikh had declared that unless the whole of his demands were acceded to he did not wish to resume discussions for another 3 months and that if the Company were unable to go to this extent Holmes* return to Kuwait before September would gain nothing. Under these circumstances, added Chisholm, he saw no use in remaining on himself in Kuwait and he therefore proposed, unless he had definite instaructions to the contrary, to leave for England forthwith. Holms s added a sentence to this telegram to the/ a’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.H., Dlitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUEHIRE.to the effect that he agreed with Chisholm’s views. Apparently nothing was heard from the London Office of the Company since Chisholm left for London, as reported on 17th. 5. Chisholm info mad mo that only 2 important points could not be agreed upon by the Company and the Shaikh: (A) was the question of the appointment by the shaikh of one of the Directors on the Company’s Board in London: (ii) Amount of royalty to be paid to the Shaikh* There was a difference of Annas 6 per ton oil in the amount offered by the Company and demanded by the Shaikh. The actual figure offered could not be mentioned. Yours sincerely,aeJUBk P.z. icjiL. INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

A discussion took place at the India Office on 8th June with representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company. present:- Sir Louis Kershaw (in the Chair) Mr. J.G.Laithwaite ) Mr. G.E.CroniMe ) India Office. Mr. Stevens. Mr. Fraser Mr. Lefroy. ) ) Kuwait Oil Company. \ ) Sir L ouis Kershaw said that the political aspect oi the Koweit negotiations was now disposed of, since the two outstanding political questions in whicn His Majesty’s Goi^xnmenfc were interested, namely, the question or Mie pulicical clauses in the commercial agreement and the question ox tus uiiisx Local Representative had now Keen satisfactorily settled. Mr. Fraser said that the commercial aspect of the negotiations was not so satisfactory. Ine Company had received from their negotiators in Koweit a copy or a revised concession (Draft Ho. 4) which the Sheikh was willing to sign 'but which included some proposals to wnich the company could not agree. Mr. Fraser read out a telegram which iney had just received from their negotiators (confirming me information given in Bushire telegram No. cm 7 »h Junu) to the effect that the Sheikh said that unless the Company accepted Draft No. 4 in toto he would not he prepared to discuss the matter further with them at present and that their negotiators should he withdrawn from Koweit until the end/J Cil end oi September. Meanwhile the Sheikh would undertake not to discuss a concession with any other Company. Ihe reasons given by .the Sheikh for this attitude were ( 1 ) the approach of the hot weather at Koweit; ( 2 ) pressing business which needed his attention and which was being held up by the oil negotiations; and (S) that the outstanding points could only be settled if the Company^ negotiators talked to their principals personally in London and explained the Sheikh^ attitude to them. He was not satisfied that it had been made clear. The Company felt that it was difficult to oppose the Sheikh*s wishes. Sir Louis Kershaw enquired what were the points outstanding between the Sheikh and the Company. Mr, Fraser and Mr. Stevens agreed that the financial points had been virtually settled. In the revised draft of the concession the Sheikh had, however, altered the basis of the payment of royalty so that instead of being paid only on oil exported from Koweit it would be paid on all oil ' won and saved ”. Mr. Fraser said that this would mean an increase of about 15 to 20 $ in the value of the royalties. A more important difficulty was that the Sheikh insisted on having a representative in London at a salary of not less than £1800 a year (to be paid by the Company) for a period of 12 years, on the expiry of which he would be replaced by a Director representing the Sheikh. This demand of the Sheikh v/as most objectionable. Sir Louis Kershaw asked whether the Company knew what made this point so important to the Sheikh, and what particular intention he had in insisting on it at this stage? Mr./Mr. Fraser said that from the Sheikh’s own point of view he did not see what reason he could have for his insistence. The Company could not give any definite reason for the difficulty which had arisen though they had certain suspicions. Sir Louis Kershaw then read out Bushire telegram ho.550 of 7th June giving the position as it appeared to the Political Agent at Koweit and the Political Resident. Was it possible that the Resident had hit the right nail on the head? Mr. Stevens said that although he disliked having to say it he must admit frankly that tor some time they had found it difficult not to entertain suspicions of a somewhat similar kind. For example, their negotiators, without the consent of the Company, had presented a new draft concession to the Sheikh embodying proposals which the Company did not approve and providing for the appointment by the Sheikh on quite unacceptable terms of a representative in London, Asked who the Sheikh had in mind for this lucrative post, and whether it would not be well to provide that its incumbent should be a Koweiti, the negotiators had first sent an obscure reply, and on being pressed had intimated that the Sheikh had issued his ultimatum. It was also relevant that their negotiators had originally said that it was the political situation which was holding up negotiations and that it would be better for them to withdraw from Koweit for the present. The Company, after consultation with His Majesty's Government, had told them to keep out of the political situation and not to leave Koweit. Thereupon they had received this latest telegram xrom Koweit/t- oweit, which almost seemed to confirm their suspicions, informing them that the Sheikh himself said that their negotiators must go. Mr. Stevens said that Major Holmes had apparently established himself in tie Sheikh’s good graces and he had constantly asserted that the Sheikh wanted the concession to be negotiated by him (Major Holmes) and to let him (Major Holmes) get something out of it. All this looked extremely shady, yet apparently Mr. Chisholm, their other negotiator, had concurred in the terns of the latest telegram from ICoweit and in the reading of the Sheikh’s attitude which it gave. He added that he had heard for the first time from Mr. Fraser only a few days ago that His Majesty’s Government saw any objection to Major Holmes. Sir L ou is Her shay; suggested that in these circumstance) the Company were faced with two alternatives: either the Company’s principals should go out to ICoweit themselves, or they should at once recall Major Holmes. Mr. Fraser said that quite apart from what Mr.Stevens had said he himself had for some time been inclined to doubt Major Holmes, in view of his previous activities in Bahrein, but that when Mr. Stevens sug eated him as one ox their negotiators in Eoweit and seemed to have confidence in him, believing, as he (Mr. Fraser) himself dia to a certain extent, that he had influence with the Sheikh, he had not felx that he could reasonably object to his appointment. Mr. Fraser agreed that the Company were faced with me alternatives suggested. Sir Louis Kershaw , asked for his advice, said he felt it would be a mistake to recall their negotiators after so much discussion and when there are so few points oust dueling, and he did not at all like the idea of a postponement until the end of September. Mr/Mr. Laitiivvaite suggested that if the Compaiiy’s principals went out to Koweit they could relieve both negotiators without loss of face, but Mr. liraser thought that if the principals went out, Major Ho lines etc. would know that they were suspected of not having handled the situation to the Company’s satisfaction. Mia Stevens asked whether the Political Agent could not make taotxul enouiries ox the Sneuxn in respect or nis \ -f' -r T\ t whether the ne go o j. a o x o ns shou 1 d b e c ontinued ' i,vi.r» .uSjL oh wax te explained 4 - r. _ onau His Majesty’s had hitherto stood aside ; t rom the commercial part it x at ions, the Company keei ping them in touch, : the Politica 1 -cigen 13 were now to otart making enquiries as suggesued op Mr.huevers, onere might be considerable difficulties irith the Sheildi since he might think that His Majesty’s Government and the Company were c o 11 ab o r at i ng. Sir Louis Kershaw said that if negotiations were postponed until September the Company might be faced with an entirely new set of demands from t he Sheikh. Mr. Stevens emphasised again that they were faced with a telegram which purported to give the views ox both negotiators. How then could the Company justixy sending out their principals against their negotiators’ advice? Sir Louis Kershaw did not attach importance to the fact that the advice seemed to come from both negotiators* Major Holmes might have had previous consultation with the Sheikh before the Sheikh’s last interview with Mr.Chisholm and himself, Mr.Fraser said that the Sheikh and Major Holmes were apparently on good terms personally and it almost seemed/ •i iseemed as if in insisting on the appointment of a Director in nondon one Snellen, was trying to do a good turn to a. friend. s Kershaw said it seemed quite wrong that one 01 the Company's negotiators should stand to receive some financial consideration from the Sheikh out of the negotiations. Mr.Stevens and Mr. Fraser agreed. l HhP.'k^Q tnen enquired tne nature of the arrangement v/hich had heen finally reached with the Sheikh in respect of tne Chiei Local Representative. Mr. Laithwaite explained that in sud stance it was tnat the provisions on this point of the political agreement should be embodied in the Commercial Agreement. We had of course made it clear that we would give full weight to the Sheikh 1 s wishes in connection with any appointment. The Company’s representatives agreed to consider urgently the question of sending out the Company’s principals to JCoweit. They undertook to inform the India Office as soon as tney had reached a decision and not to recall Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm without consulting the India Office again. Ia the decision was in favour of despatching the principals, no previous warning would De given to the negotiators, who would be informed by telegram that the principals were leaving.^ L INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

The Company* s representatives said that before instructions consequent on their discussion at the India Office on 8 th Cune had been despatched, they had received a telegram from Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm, stating that wiie oneimh had enquired of them why they were still there and what action the Company had taken on his recent representations to them, fhe negotiators strongly urged in these circumstanceq/that unless the Company was prepared to accede to the Sheikh*s demands in full they should at once be withdrawn. 2# Tne Company said that in these circumstances they thought tne right course was to wire withdrawing Major Holmes, leaving Mr• Cnisholm to hold the fort in Koweit. There was admittedly the risk of a request from the Sheikh that Mr. Chisholm should also leave Koweit. If this should happen tney would not, ho?«iever, propose to withdraw him farther than to Abadan. 3. Mr. Warner enquired whether it would not be possible to meet the Sheikh by withdrawing both, and one or more principals going out to discuss matters with them en route ■. and thereafter proceeding immediately to Koweit to carry on/on the negotiations in the light of the discussion. The Company, however, remained of opinion that the course they advocated was the right one, and in the light of discussion Sir Louis Kershaw agreed. They undertook also not to remove Mr. Chisholm without consultation with H .-kvi. G • 4. It may he added that Mr. Eraser indicated that if the Company’s suspicions of Major Holmes proved to he well- founded, he would not ceturn to Koweit • They thought it desirable, however, in the telegraphic instructions they were sending him, to state that he was being recalled for a brief x^eriod of consultation only and would be required to return as early as possible. If in the light of their discussion they saw reason to take a different course they would of course be at liberty to do so.P.Z.

The Coy’s, representatives gave information of the reply received from their representative at Koweit to the telegram which was sent to the latter after the meeting at the 1 . 0 . on 12th June. The reply intimated that the Sheikh had been much annoyed by the further approach made to him, and had threatened to withdraw his undertaking to give the Coy. a period of grace till September to decide on his terms, unless the representatives withdrew forthwith to consult their principals in London. Major Holmes has already left for London, and the telegram stated that Mr.Chisholm would do so on Sunday. The Coy. was undecided as to its course of action, Mr.Lefroybeing in favour of allowing Mr.Chisholm to come home, Mr.Stevens inclining to the view that he should be directed to remain. As in view of the apparent attitude of the Sheikh,, it did not seem that any good purpose would be served by Mr.Chisholm remaining, it is understood that the Coy., will probably decide to allow him to return on Sunday as he intends.* s\ CONFIDENTIAL.

Being a Moslem, and, unlike most 'converts”, being trusted by his fellow Mohammedans, he is in a position to gauge local Moslem opinion fairly correctly. I was careful to avoid expressing my own opinion and let him talk, which he was quite willing to do. 2. On the subject of Kuwaiti Oil he was definitely of opinion that Major Holmes was the nigger in the wood pile, and for his own ends had assisted the Sheikh to stick out for high terms from the K.O*C. He said that the Sheikh would never have adopted such a stiff attitude towards the Company unless he had been instigated thereto by Major Holmes. 3. Qatar Oil . He, Haji Williamson, had gone to Qatar with Mr. Mylles of the A.P#O.C. on his recent visit to the Sheikh, and on the whole was rather favourably impressed with the Sheikh’s attitude, which had improved since the last visit of the A.P.CHC, representatives last year. He thought that the policy of leaving the sheikh alone, and so giving the impression that the Company were not running after him to get the concession, had been successful. He was under the impression that there were some hopes, though, of course, he could not commit himself in any way definitely, that at the end of the new option perio d/parioa the Sheikh might he willing to abate his terms. He said that he had heard indirectly that Ibn Baud’s stock had somewhat gone down with the Sheikh, as a consequence of the evacuation of Hoaeida and the Yemen Littoral without apparently payment of any subsidy on the part of the Imam. The sheikh of Kuwait, in the course of casual conversation with me a day or two later, also expressed the opinion that the final result of the Saudi-Yemeni war was not regarded by the Arabs of the Gulf as by any means too successful from Ibn Baud's point of view.

The matter having been dealt with in the Governn.ent agreement, which the Shaikh has approved, and in this supplementary assui^nce there is, therefore, no need in the ne Dilations ,/» — -A *• between the Shaikh and the Company for any further discussion the foregoing proposal has the full concurrence of ihe Company should include any provision regarding the question except a clause providing, for example, that 11 the Company shall from time to time designate its General Manager or one of its other principal employes in Kuwait as its Chief Local representative I understand that the Company, on resumption of tneir negot- then raise any difficulties in connection with the difference between the commercial agreement and article 4 of the Government agreement read with the above assurance, *fatts should report on his attitude and I will send further instructions. So far as I can see at present, in such an event it would meet the case to remind him that in accordance with the correspondence enclosed with Dickson’s letter of 6th June, C-2097 the. 4^ ■ commercial agreement is subordinate to the Government agreement in case of inconsistency, and to assure him that in regard to the appointment of Chief Local Representative it will be subordinate also to the assurance given in paragraph No. 3 above• of the question of the method of aq£?Bfl±icfc±x$ approving the appointment.

Ihe draft Concession seems to be unobjectionable from our point of view, but before informing the Company in this sense we should be grateful if you could let uc know whether the Petroleum Department see any objection to the insertion of the word 'crude' before 'petroleum' in Article, 1 or to the new Article 20 about measurement, or whether ,you have any other comments to make on the new draft. 2. You will see that the draft for the first time gives the sheikh the right to appoint a Representative in London, and lays down that the Representative shall '•C. starling, Esq., Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley street s.w, i.2 be of Koweiti, British, or American nationality. We have ^ for practical purposes acquiesced in the appointment of a London representative if the Koweit oil Company are prepared to agree to it, in the informal discussions that have taken place with the Company; Put the question of nationality now comes up for the first time. It would of course Pe definitely preferaPle on general political grounds that the Representative should Pe a British or a Koweiti suPject. But we are on the whole inclined not to raise the point. It might well Pe difficult to persuade the Company to meet us over it: and having regard to the very restricted nature of the duties which the Lonaon representative, if appointed, will perform, to the fact tnat tney will Pe in connection with the safeguarding of the Sheika 1 s interests in commercial matters, ana to the provision which has Peen made in the Political Agreement for canalising the disposal of all political questions which may arise locally through the political agent, we think any risk involved can safely Pe taken. 3.

The insertion of the word n crude 11 in Article 1 is only a drafting amendment and the new Article SO is satisfactory. I agree with you, for the reasons you state, that the appointment of an American as the London representative of the Shaikh is not a point which we would be well advised to object to, if the Shaikh sees fit to make such a choice. You will remember that we reserved the right to examine the financial provisions which are to be inserted in the Concession and in view of the small drilling od ligations which at present appear in the Concession this should not be overlooked.

The Political Agent was further to inform, the Sheikh 1&lt;l *m , 11 ,-, | 11 ---MM imnui i ri.i I I|J L .-;b that, the matter having been dealt with in the Government Agreement which he had approved and in this supplementary assurance, there was therefore no need in the negotiations between the Sheikh and the Company for further discussion of the question of the method of approving the appointment. W. Fraser, Esq. , C.B.H. , Kuwait Oil Company Ltd. , Britannic Rouse, Finsbury Circus, E.C.2.nv We have now received a telegram from the Political Agent. This states that the Sheikh returned an unsatisfactory reply to the letter addressed to him, but that the Political Agent thereupon interviewed the Sheikh, who agreed finally that the question of the Chief Local Representative could be dealt with as laid down in the Political Agent’s letter and premised to give a written agreement to that effect if and when a concession was actually granted to the Company, but not before. In view of the fact that the Sheikh has agreed orally that the questions can be dealt with as laid down in the Political Agent’s letter, it is hoped that the Sheikh will not again raise the question of the Chief Representative during the resumed negotiations of the Company’s representatives at Kuwait.

Kuwai t. 28th Rajab 1353 6th November 1934 Dear friends Major Holmes and Mr.Chisholm. After compliments; With reference to the two drafts of the Kuwait Cil concession agreement which you have recently sent us, and which have been noted, we have also noted your statements regarding the proofs and reasons of your directors for having altered several articles that were agreed upon at the interview which you had with us in our place at Bayan prior to your journey to England in the month of June last. On having thoroughly investigated the alterations that appear in tne last draft of the concession agreement, we have come to the conclusion that further discussions of any sort will not result in the interest of either of us. Therefore as we desire to bring our discussions to an end, and to end matters definitely, we have decided to put up the following two suggestions, either of which is acceptable to us. ye draw your attention particulail^ to have your directors warned that our demands include all the terms you find shown in our suggestions (a) and (B). We have written down each one separately. There are a few more points of little importance, shown in the two drafts of tne agreement, but these are mostly agreeable to us. Yours sincerely sd/ Ahmad a 1 Jaber As Suoahterms desire&lt;i to ** inserted in the agreement. / (a) The royalty to be paid on crude oil M won-and-saved H in Kuwait, alter deducting water,sand and other foreign substances, likewise the company’s normal requirements 01 ^ ? or operations and works within the teritory of Kuwait. Payments a s per our suggestion (a) should be as follows (1) Payment on signature Rs.475,000 (2) Yearly rent « 95,000 (3) Royalty on each imglish ton Rs. 3 /- on crude oil production. (4) Minimum royalty per year Rs* 250,000 For taxation exemption as. 4 per each ton of crude oil on which royalty is payable. As regards the question of the director wnom we wish to appoint we shall discuss that if and when your directors have agreed to our suggestions. (B) Royalty to be paid on the basis of export and sales; and payments as per this our suggestion (3) should be as follows (1) Initial payment Rs.600,000 (2) Yearly rent ' 100,000 (3) Royalty on each English ton Rs. 3/3 on exports &amp; sales (4) Minimum royalty per year Rs.300,000 (5) For taxation exemption As. 3 per each English ton. Besides the above the company shall have the right to return a quantity of the crude oil (partly treated) to its original source to the maximum of 7if } and this maximum quantity is to be estimated on the monthly production of crude oil after flteiBijetxxg extracting from it the water etc. The questions of the director and the Chief local representative shall be dealt with, as shown in our suggestion (a) above, if and when your directors have agreed to our suggestion (3).SSCRET. V 0 LIT I GAL AG -TICY, KUWAIT, The 17th November 1934 No.C-297• S ubject: - ff GIL Tf , Since my return from leave lest month, I have been quietly trying to find out something about the intrigues of a strange Oil concern or Company, inimical to the Kuwait Oil Company, which (and I say this guardedly at present) as far as I can irwha out has been operating from BASRA during the past Summer, and continues to be 2 • If you recollect in my Confidential Express Letter No.C-146, dated the 24th April 1934 end paragraph 6 (c), I mentioned the fact that the ; haikh had received a telegram from a rival Oil concern which at the time was thought to have come froa the E.C,r.Company by Holmes and Chisholm. The purport of that telegram was that the strange Company offered to the Shaikh to go one better in every respect than the Kuwait Oil Company, and was obviously sent with a view to prevent the Shaikh coming to a favourable decision with the Kuwait Oil Company (as it was thought he would). 3. The Shaikh, as you know, admitted at the time to me that he had received the telegram in question, and said that it purported to cone from an all British Concern, but he would not tell me the name. 4. I believe later enquiries from London satisfied Holmes and Chisholm that tho E.O.D. had nothing to do with the telegram, nor were the I.P.C, suspected. 1 myself came to the conclusion that it had probably been sent at the instigation of the Shaikh himself in a rather active. ]p • cb M p childish/ The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.?owle, Political Resident in the Persian fulf BUSHIHE.2 1 7 childish attempt to try and force the Kuwait Oil Company to hid higher than they were doing. 5. I believe I have now got on the track of the senders of the telegram, but of course I say this with the greatest reserve seeing that my evidence is only of a circumstantial nature at present. It was Messrs: Frank £trick &amp; Co., of Basra (and London), working through their Lawyer in Basra, K.B. Mirza Mohamed, C.I.L., 6 . I have also practically proved that friend Mirza Mohamed is in secret partnership with Mr.Gabriel, the Shaikh’s lawyer (thereby also hangs a tale where the Shaikh’s date gardens are concerned), and that before I returned from England the former sent Mr.Gabriel on 20th August last to Kuwait, to see the Shaikh* Mr. Gabriel was armed with a completely drawn up and printed Oil Agreement in which he offered the Shaikh every single thing he wanted including money, royalty, director, Chief local sepresentativ* etc., etc. The figures of course being better in every respect than those offered by the Kuwait Oil Company. 7, The Shaikh was, I understand, very gratified that another Company had come forward to bid against the Kuwait Oil Company, but when he was asked to sign, his native caution came to his aid and he said No, and told Gabriel that the Company he represented must first go to His Majesty’s Government in London, be vetted and then come back with His Majesty’s Government’s blessing. 8. The Shaikh himself and ’’quite off his own bat” after pledging me to secrecy, told me the story and said that the completely drawn up concession had been brought himfeaq and by an Iraqi^that he had been pressed hard to si ^. He declined to say however who the person was who brought the papers to him, nor would he divulge the name of the Company. 9 ; j have not of course discussed a word of theof the above wixh either Major Holmes oc Mr.Chisholm of the Kuwait Oil Company, but frcm one or t \70 remarks which the former has passed I should not be surprised if he was not himself well on the track of the enemy. 10 . One thing I have gathered, and that is that Holmes and Chisholm are not working as smoothly as they should be these days. fhe reason may be (and I only suggest this, mind you) that Holmes has found out about the rival concern, and puts down the whole business to/plox on the part of the A.P.O.C. to ’’double cross'* the Kuwait Oil Company, and may also feel that Chisholm is not as ignorant of the business as he pretends to be. 11. The following facts are significant, I think: (a) ?.Stride &amp; Co., are connected with the iwP.O.C. and receive an annual sum of money from the latter for 'good will' etc. (b) Hirza Mohamad is legal adviser to the A.P.O.C. ltd. and Is also lawyer to F.Striek &amp; Go. (c) Mirza Mohamad and Mr.Oabriel are partners in the same firm, though the t oriel believes ^ the latter to be working with a Turk named nrteen Sffen&amp;l. (d) Mir'~a Mohatned recently became an Iraq subject. 12 . le it beyond the bounds of possibility that the A.P.O.C. smarting under the fact that they were unable themselves to get an Oil Concession out of the Shaikh because of the Americans, for appearances sake leagued themselves with these selfsame Amerioans, and while outwardly agreeing to work with them 'under the name Kuwait Oil Company secretly set themselves the task of hindering progress from the st-rt with the deliberate intention of preventing the Shaikh from giving the Gil Concession to the Kuwait il Company, and at the psychological moment and when negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Company had reached a deadlock they had readyready a new and secret subsidiary company to throw into the breach, and so walk off with the prize. This Company, of course, would in no way be connected with the A.P.O.C., as far as the world was concerned, it would be all British and be registered in London and Iraq, 13. I gather also that Mlrza Mohamed and Mr.Gabriel are already directors in the new concern, 14. I send you the above for what it is worth and I hope you will not think my suggestion about the A.P.O.C. being behind Strick too fantastic or unfair.uffife. Telegram I.F.0.1927 and 30.

Secret information of a somewhat confusing character has been received through indirect channels but from a responsible source that a British Group known as ' Trades Limited n and largely apparently composed of members of B.O.D.( which however is not as a company concerned in the matter) is competing against Kuwait Oil Company. It is even stated Shaikh has actually granted to this group an Oil Concession over his territory 'subject to approval of His Majesty’s Government'. 3 . This information hardly seems credible but I should be glad if without broaching matter to Shaikh you could telegraph if possible before Thursday morning whether you have any information of any sort bearing on it, and also present position negotiations between Shaikh and Kuwait Oil Company. If there is any foundation whatever for rumour it may possibly be connected with overtures which Shaikh stated last Spring had been made to him from a British source. But a serious situation ¥fould arise if we found that he had without our knowledge entered into discussions with any would-be concessionaries and still more if he had formally committed himself to them.
