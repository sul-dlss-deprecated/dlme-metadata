Bahrein Petroleum Company, New ¥ork, have invoked assistance of British Petroleum authorities in obtaining export licence for ^COO (half 6000 ) long tons of cement from Bombay required at Bahrein for new refinery project. Licence is said to have been refused on ground of shortage of cement for civil requirements.

Cwta, Cubic feet.£•&amp; Q«3e ere tary I • Ivi* .Bull of the Petroleum Division, K.F Jp9 4aibe ^ o iee me yesterday about the requirements of the Oil Companies in the Arab States, in the Persian Gulf, (in practice this means the Bahrein, Petroleum Company only), from the U«K. I referred to the last sentence of paragraph 1 of the Secretary of State's telegram to the Government of India, No .8535 of April 30th, which says: 'I understand that all Oil Companies' requirements from TJ.K. are included in military programme and can be excluded from this arrangement'* viz. the proposed arrangement for allotting shipping space for the requirements of the Arab States. Mr .Bull said that it had been the intention to include the requirements of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in the programme of the P.A.I.C. As however it had never been possible to get over the prohibition against any shipjgasg from this country calling at Bahrein unless it carried 200 tons of cargo consigned there, this intention had never been put into effect; and the sentence in question is true only with regard to the requirements of the Oil Companies in Persia and Iraq which, of course, are no concern of ours• The requirements of B.P.C. will now have to be shipped via India and will presumably be included in the Indian civil programme. From the point of view of the political authorities i the Gulf, the inaccuracy in our telegram U 0.8555 is of no importance; all that matters to them is that they will n to issue import assistance recommendations for requirement the B.P.C. You may however think it worth while to advise the Government of India that these requirements will not be included in any military programme. As regards the procedure for allotting shipping space to these requirements in the future, Mr.Bull will advise the Texas Oil Company (who act as agents for B.P.C. in tnis country) to submit their applications to the Petroleum Division. If the latter support the applications they will forward them to me and I will ask you to issue the necessary C.P.Ls. A5r •2. Mr•Bull said that the Petroleum Division support the thre* applications below. That marked X was ^anded to me by him. He thinks that you may have alreaaj iss an C.P.L. for the application marked Y on the strength of a telephone request which he made to Mr. Gandee. Would you please check this and issue two or three O-F.Ls as may be necessary? olj'.V.M-S 7 /tAv ~f ^ CA*~( *' ' L C^’ z^- , 7 f V' Zk /O 0 ■ { 1 U / ^ ^ £&gt;+'&gt;‘^ C</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00035c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/817</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00035c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/817</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Ext 2309/43 Texas Oil Co and Bahrain Petroleum Co'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1943/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-10-26T22:03:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (55 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 55; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and telegrams from the Government of India, External Affairs, and Defence Departments; the India Office Economic and Overseas Department; the Secretary of State for India; and Texas Oil Company Ltd, regarding the delivery of calcium chloride, emery cloth, glass paper, cement, and other materials to the Bahrain Petroleum Company.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Texaco</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Supply and demand</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Department of Defence</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Economic Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00035c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
