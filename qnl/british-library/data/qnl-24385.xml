Later on the 10tn day of Sha T ban datea 29th Rajab 1356 it has been proved to me by a letter/sent to me by the acting .,auhi of Jubail niimaa bin ’iuhammaa bin Ali bin Arfaj to the effect that before him, i.e., the Acting ^adhi Abaul A ziz bin Nasir bin Zuhairan, appeared Hamad bin Muhammad bin Duraim and stated that Ali bin Ahmad bin Ali bin Fayez is the nearest relative to Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Nasir bin Fayez who died in Oman and that there is no other legal heir. Therefore it has been proved to me that the said Ali is the only heir of Abdullah ana the effects of the deceased should therefore be handed over to the said heir after which the man in whose possession the effects are would be free from any liability.
