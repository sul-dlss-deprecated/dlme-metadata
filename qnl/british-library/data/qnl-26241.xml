The report, while mainly of technical interest to the Air Staff at Delhi and in London, forms a valuable supplement and corrective to our previous information on the subject. Flying-Officer Trusk amply redeemed his forced landing, and the loss of a petrol tank is well compensated for by the intelligence obtained. Though the fact is not mentioned in this report we learn from Sir F.Humphrys’s despatch No. 4 of 1929 that the occupants of the aeroplane, which came down on the Shfirnur aerodrome, after being hit were tree,ted by the .Afghan Air Force Commander with every courtesy.

F., to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, dated Kabul, the 8th January 1929. I have the honour to forward a report on the Afghan Air Force at Sherpur Aerodrome, compiled from information collected by me during the period 18th December 1928 to 3rd January 1929. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter &gt; ■ 7 : Date/ 24 JAu 1S23Afghan Air 'Force. (Stationed at Sherpur Aerodrome—Kabul). The following report on the Afghan Air Force is compiled from personal observations made, in addition to conversations with Russian and Afghan pilots and other personnel of the Air Force, on Sherpur Aerodrome during the period 18th December 1928 and 3rd January 1929. Owing to the present conditions and situation in general it has been impossible to gain access to hangars, workshops and Headquarters ohices, so that no information on the undermentioned points can be given at present:— (а) Number of unserviceable aeroplanes. (б) Number that can be made serviceable in addition to those in use. (c) Facilities and capabilities of workshops. (d) Efficiency of mechanics. (e) Spares available. (/) Number of bomb racks and aerial guns available, 1. Strength — (a) Aircraft .—The undermentioned aircraft are serviceable and are in use at present :— 7 D. H. 9-As. (Russian type—Liberty engine). 1 Henry Potez (single engine, French type). 7 Junker monoplanes (single engine type). 1 Junker monoplane (three engine type—King’s aeroplane). ■(b) Personnel—' 12 Russian pilots. 10 Afghan pilots. 2 German pilots (one solely for King’s aeroplane). 5 Subordinate officers. 2 German mechanics (King’s aeroplane). 12 Afghan mechanics. 3 Russian mechanics. \ ery few Afghan pilots fly and are chiefly employed on aerodrome &lt;n lar d duties or else as messengers for the Air Force Commandant. No definite ground duties other than above are allotted to them The whole of the organisation and administration is carried out by the Commandant and Assistant Commandant in conjunction with Russian pilots. Russian pilots are chiefly responsible for the flying and maintenance o£ Hk aeroplanes m the Afghan Air lorce. Sometimes mechanics fly as “air gunners and at other times Afghan pilots fly as “ observers”. Whenever there are any important flying duties to be carried out Russian pilots prefer Russians as observers ’ or “ air gunners”. ^ F The Commandant, Muhammed Ihsan Khan, who was trained in Italy f u ar9 &gt; 19 eons.dered a bad pilot and very seldom flies. Apart from the fact that his living capabilities are not worth considering, it is considered that Force* 1 Ca ^ a ^ le Commandant and exercises full control of the Air I he Assistant Commandant, Muhammed Hashim, who Italy, is far below the average ” as a pilot and only flies Russian pilots. w'as also trained in as an observer with2 No definite duties seem to he allotted to the “ Subordinate ” Officer ; they are not pilots and wander aimlessly about armed with rifles whether “ on duty ” or “ off 2. Equipment and Supplies —(«) Armament. —D. H. 9A.s are fitted to carry two front guns for the pilot and one rear gun for observer to use on scarff ^ mounting. No information regarding the number of guns available is known. D. H. 9A.s are fitted for bomb racks as follows :— One rack on starboard main plane to carry 4 small type bombs. One rack on port main plane to Carry 4. small type bombs. One rack on under side of fuselage to carry 2 small type bombs. Total load—10 small type bombs. From conversations with Afghan pilots it is almost certain that no large type of bombs racks are available. During the operations against Bachai Saqao and the Shinwaris, small type bombs were used. D. H. 9A.s have carried out this w T ork with Russians as pilots. Bombing has been carried out on three occasions by formations of three aeroplanes in wide formation. No information as regards the type of bomb- sight used is available. Bomb releases are fitted in rear cockpits. A suffi cient number of bomb racks to equip six D. H. 9A.s only have up to the present been observed. (ft) Wireless equipment. —Afghan pilots state that there are no generators for use of W/T in aircraft. This w r as more of less confirmed by the keen interest in, and close examination of (by various personnel), the W/T gene rator on J.-7 25 8 after the forced landing at Shepur Aerodrome. Pilots also stated that no “ radio ” practice w as carried out. (c) Petrol and oil. —It is rumoured that the Air Force is short of petrol and oil at present. Small quantities of petrol have been brought from Russia by air in the Junker monoplanes, and small quantities of oil from Kandahar by the same type of aeroplane. A small building South of the large hangar on the West side of the aerodrome is being used as a petrol store. Petrol is kept in 4-gallon drums. It is not knowm wdiether this is a permanent or temporary store for petrol. The existence of a recognised petrol dump is not knowm. (d) Bombs. —It wms reported that after the last bomb raid on Jalalabad there was a shortage of bombs and that 70 bombs were sent to Kabul by air from Russia. During the operations against Bachai Saqao not more than six bombs w r ere dropped by a formation of three aeroplanes in one raid. During the total number of raids carried out each aeroplane dropped an average of two bombs each. Details of bombing raids may be obtained from “ Movements of Aircraft ” attached. According to observations made of bursting effects, it is assumed that the type of bomb used is similar to that of the 20 lb. Cooper bomb. Nothing is knowm of the existence of a “ Bomb Dump ”. (e) Flying clothing. —An adequate supply of warm flying clothing is available for pilots and mechanics. The following is worn by flying personnel : — Black fur-lined flying helmets. Goggles (of light motoring type). Black leather fleece-lined flying coats (J length). Knee-boots (Fearnought with leather bottoms). Black leather flying gloves. (/) Spares. —It is believed that few engine spare parts are available. No spare wheels are carried on aircraft. No information regarding the arrival of spares from Russia is available. 3. Brief notes on types of Aircraft—{a) T). U. PA.—Russian type (similar to R. A. F. type).3 Markings .—The main planes, fuselage and tail unit are painted a dark Olive green colour. Identification discs are painted in the centre of the under side of the main planes as under : — Outer Black (about 5 feet diameter). Tuner circle .—Dark red. Centre. —Pea green. Each circle is about five inches wide. The rudder is marked with black, d irk red and pea green vertical stripes about 6 inches wide, the green stripe being near the trailing edge of the rudder. There are no identification discs or markings on the top of the top main planes. Engine. —400 h. p. Liberty. General.—T&gt;. H. 9A.s and Henry Potez are the only types at present in the Afghan Air Force which can be equipped for war. D. H. 9A.s are invari- ablv flown by Russian pilots During the air operations against the Shinwaris, Russian pilots carried out all the bomb rakls and reconnaissance with Russians as observers. During the air operations against Bachai Saqao, Russian pilots carried out all bomb raids and reconnaissance, but at times Afghan pilots were carried as observers. Very little formation flying has been carried out except the three occasions when bomb raids were carried out in wide formation. On these occasions the formation was very poor, regular intervals were not maintained and the aeroplanes in no way held their positions in a steady manner. ^No landings in formation were attempted. No aerobatics are carried out. No night flying is carried out nor have the D. H. 9A.s any night-flying equipment. Landings on the whole are good, but it is seldom that pilots consider the wind when landing. During the period 18lh December 1928 to 3rd January 1929 inclusive, D. H. 9A.s have done 32 hours’ flying. It is not known how T many pilots were employed to carry out that amount of flying. Details of flying times may be obtained from “ Movements of Aircraft ” attached. (b) Junker s monoplanes. —(Single engine type). All metal (corrugated), commercial type of monoplane. Dual control. Markings.— Wing* and fuselage painted silver grey colour. Black squares (about 5 feet X 4 feet) painted in centre of underside of bottom main planes. Black letters on side of fuselage. (English lettering). Controls. —All controls to rudder, tail planes and aelerons are internally fitted. Aelerons and tail plane controlled by wheel type of control column. Rudder control—pedal type rudder bar. Instruments.— aeroplane instruments are fitted. Undercarriage—Y type metal undercarriage with springs encased by streamlined metal cowlings. Wired wheels with black discs. Capacity. —Two seats in pilot’s cockpit side by side to carry either two pilots or pilot and mechanic. Normally each aeroplane carries one pilot and one mechanic. Carries four other passengers with small amount of baggage. Passenger compartment is fitted out on same principal as motor car seating accommodation and is upholstered in red leather. Spring blinds are fitted to windows and carpets on floor. Ash trays are also fitted. Enqine' —300 h. p. Heavy oil type—water cooled—six-cylinder type (self starting). The exhaust pipe leads out through the top of engine cowling and extends over top of fuselage. The engine cowling is hinged at the rear end and when lifted up exposes all main parts of the engine. Speed. —Normal cruising speed—100 m. p. h. Maximum speed—120 m. p. h.

They have taken no part in air operations, but some of them have been employed in bringing petrol from Russia and oil from Kandahar in small quantifies. One small Junker used for conveying mails and important personages from Kabul to Kandahar, or vice versa, is flown by a German pilot named Joas. (c) Junker monoplane. — (Three engine type.) King’s aeroplane Construction. —On same lines as single engine type. All metal (cor rugated). Markings. —The wings and fuselage are painted silver grey colour with the engine cowlings and undercarriage black. The tips and underside of wings painted red with Royal crest in grey. Engines. —Total 900 h. p. Three heavy oil—air-cooled—six-cylinder engines (same type as single engine Junker). Speed. —Normal cruising speed—140 m. p. h. Maximum speed—160 m. p. h. Landing space. —Takes off with full load in about 300 yards and lands in about 400 yards. General. —This aeroplane is flown by a German pilot named Rothe, who is known as the King’s pilot. Two German mechanics are employed on this aeroplane. Only one flight has been carried out recently, when the Royal Family (except the King) were evacuated to Kandahar on 21st December 1928. The pilot stated that the aeroplane had only been used three times by the King since his return from European tour. 4. Brief summary o'n air operations carried out. —In view of the fact that the surrounding country is in such a critical state owing to the Shinwari rebellion and repeated attacks of the rebels of Bachai Saqao on Kabul, which has necessitated &gt; ery important air operations, it is considered that the reported strength of aircraft, etc., constitutes all the effective equipment of the Afghan Air Force at present. It is further considered that the work carried out represents the maximum effort on a war operations basis with the present material available. These operations have more or less proved that the war value of the Afghan pilot is very low and that the efficiency of the Afghan Air Force depends on Russians. This is borne out by the fact that during the air operations against the Shinwaris no Afghan pilots took part or were even allow ed by the Russians to fly as “ observers ” or “ air gunners ”. It is believed that the necessary workshop facilities have been, or are being, provided, but as no details are at present available, it is not possible to predict the future state of efficiency of the aircraft. At present the aircraft are being maintained in a reasonable state of efficiency. J032(C) F&amp;Pl)PART II. Sherpur Aerodrome. (Report — 3rd January 1929.) 1.

Minister atjl'll abul to discourage any policy of facilitating the supply of British aircraft and spaie carts. Sir Francis Humphrys j has always regards the Afghan Air Force as an expensive luxury for die Amir from a military point of view and predicted that, apart from civil aviation, :Uic Afghan Government will in due course find themselves constraiued i.o do without it wnen once tliey caii got rid of tuc ivussioii j clement which fosters its maintenance foi political pur- upases. Recent information is to the effect that nearly al]j : Uie ma Wriel mentioned iii tills no to is out. of ccl* issicn, but tnat the Russians have forced on the Afghan dovernmen as par K ol the subsidy under the Russo-Afghan Treaty) some 24 aeroplanes of which 16 /ill oe delivereo shortly.

In the mean time the Afghan 'ro\ern- -ment, not discouraged by their purchase of fou* tery derelict machines in 1926 from private sources in India, ha\e aptiied to be allowed to import three machines which were bestowed on the Alwar Durbar after the war as u gift in recognition of war services, but which appear to ha\e been intended rather for exhibition than for any practieji use. , TltXt lt~^U l h n**, that the Afghan Do\- -eminent ha.e done Uisii best to Obtain British airciuit, but that owing to the suspicion with which the Afghan Air ^orce as a Russian controlled organisation has been re- -garded by us they ha\e oeen accorded small facility ano the purchases they ha\e made on their own account ha\e been ill-ad\ised # In fact in India, vhich is the source to which Afghanistan must necessarily turn for supply, there is no such stock of surplus niiuiaft as the doapa^Ui proposed to be issued by the Foreign Office contemplates. aIoc ^ioreo\er there is^difficulty in regard to tlie supply of r&gt;ri personnel which could alone secure e'fiuieiit flying of aircraft obtained from ritlsh sources.

Sir, Foreign Office. S.W.l. 26th July, 1927. I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to transmit herewith a copy of the draft of a circular, regarding the sale of British aircraft, v/hich he proposes to communicate to His Majesty^ Representatives in all countries except those where the sale of aircraft might present objections from the political point of view. 2. Sir Austen Chamberlain will be glad to learn whether the Secretary of State for India sees any objection to the transmission to His Majesty^ Representative at Kabul of the instructionsMy attention has recently been drawn to the scarcity ox foreign orders placed with British manufacturers of aircraft and accessories for some time past. I understand that to some extent this is due to a feeling abroad that the purchase of British aircraft by foreign governments or private organisations is not practicable, partly because of the higher prices of British machines of equal carrying capacity as compared with foreign machines, and partly because of the strict control of the British Air Ministry in regard to the disclosure of the most recent developments in design. S. With regard to the first point the natural result of an appreciated currency in continental countries manufacturing aircraft must be to stabilise the cost of manufacture eventually/eventually on a much higher level, thus reducing the margin of difference in price and enabling British goods to compete. 3. The second point has been carefully considered by the Air Ministry and as a result a number of important concessions have been made, where-'fcy recent designs are no longer under the same ban of secrecy as hitherto. In these changed circumstances it may be confidently stated that no foreign firm is now able to supply designs of aircraft having technical superiority over British. 4. I am bringing these facts to your notice in order to enable you to utilise any suitable opportunity of pressing the claims of British aircraft in the country to which you are accredited, since His Majesty's Government are anxious to develop the industrial capacity of the United Kingdom for the manufacture of aircraft, whether for Of civil transport for military purposes, in the same way as they endeavour to secure foreign orders for private shipbuilding yards.It is not desirable to give details of the regulations affecting changes in design as these are regarded as strictly confidential, and manufacturers themselves prefer to discuss these points only in connection with potential orders. It will be sufficient, therefore, merely to indicate to interested persons the general grounds which now exist in favour of the purchase of British machines. 5. The prospects of selling British aircraft in countries which possess a well developed aircraft industry are comparatively small. There is, however, a fair demand from these countries for British aircraft engines and instruments and there is also a possibility of participation by British firms in local manufacture, either directly or by the sale of constructional licences and patent rights for material of British design1 -^ HUT AWAY WITH Development of Aviation in Afghanistan and Policy of His Majesty’s Government. Note by Political Department, India Office. Aviation in Afghanistan dates from 1921. At the present moment, as far as can be ascertained from the available information, the Afghan Government dispose of an Air Force consisting of 22 machines, of which at the most 11 are capable of being flown, and of about 25 officers and men, all apparently Russian with the exception of three Afghans. It is reported that the Russians may ultimately be replaced by I Afghan youths who have been in training at Moscow since 1925, and that a certain [ number of Afghans are already employed in a subordinate capacity in the Afghan aerodromes. Afghanistan has as yet developed few, if any, of the material or technical resources necessary to support aviation as a national enterprise. The country, at any rate south of the Hindu Kush, would seem to be too mountainous to afford good training- ground for Afghan aviators. Civil aviation in the present state of the country does not seem likely to be economically profitable. There is little indication that the Afghan Government has a settled policy on the subject beyond the desire to possess a certain number of aeroplanes, the most conspicuous use of which is to carry the Royal mails when the King is on tour. Sir F. Humphrys, in a Despatch dated 5th August 1925, remarked that “ to all intents and purposes the Afghan Air Force is a Russian service and may indeed be regarded as a Russian advance base.” It is not clear that by the expression “advance base ” he necessarily meant the way the Force would behave in the event of a military attack from Russia on India. He might have meant that the Russian personnel in the Afghan Air Force serve as a Soviet propagandist agency in the country, or that they would act against their present masters in the event of Afghanistan becoming embroiled with Russia. He went on to say that he considered it doubtful whether, in the event of a serious rising threatening the capital, the Russian aviators would safeguard the Central Government. He considered the Air Force, as at present constituted, to be “ a potential source of danger rather than strength to Afghanistan.” At the same time he saw little prospect of such a force being maintained, even at its present strength, except under foreign control and with foreign financial assistance. Before summarising the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government towards the development of the Afghan Air Force at its various stages some account must be given of the composition of the Force in materiel and personnel, the arrangements which have been made or contemplated for training of personnel ax\(\ for supplvof stores and construction of aerodromes, and the flying activity of the Force. Materiel. The materiel has been collected at the various dates stated below from various sources :— Remarks. 0 (A) (B) (C) Date of receipt. No. Type. Source.

There is no evidence that these machines have been assembled to fly since acquisition or are now capable of being flown. Out of (11), one Bristol Fighter has been crashed and the other Bristol Fighter and one D.H. 9 are believed to be out of repair. Thus the force in active commission consists of 10 machines, one of German and nine of British make, all acquired from Russian sources. Of the machines obtained from Russia, eight (including the two derelicts in (A)) are part of a gift of 12 aeroplanes understood to have been promised by the Soviet Government under the terms of the Russo-Afghan Treaty concluded in 1921, at the time when the Anglo-Afghan Treaty was under negotiation. The other five were, it is believed, offered as a gift on condition that Russian pilots and mechanics were afterwards employed by the Afghan Government; but in the end the Afghans are understood to have insisted on paying for them. The circumstances of the purchases of the two Bristol Fighters from His Majesty’s Government in 1921 and of the four! useless machines from a Karachi firm in 1924-0 will be further detailed in thej portion of this note dealing with the policy of His Majesty’s Government. None of the machines are, the Military Attache at Kabul reported in June 1926, fitted with bomb-racks or to carry automatic rifles. i Personnel. Sir F. Humphrys, in his Despatch No. 64, dated 5th August 1925, supplemented F-3&gt;&lt;jS5 by later telegrams, has reported the personnel of the Afghan Air Force to consist of the following:— Nationality. Remarks. Ghund Mishar Mnhairm\ad Ihsan Khan (Chief Afghan of the Air Force (Pilot 1 ) ). Kandak Mishar Muhammad Hashim Khan Afghan (Second in Command (Observer) ). Kandak Mishar Ghulam Dastgir (mechanic) - „ - About 25 other officers and men (of whom 18 Russians - were in dune 1926 reported available for duty). # Aged 25 ; trained 2 years in Italy. fAlso trained in Italy. 1* M Pilots and mechanics. * After which, according to the Military Attache, Kabul, he was declared efficient to prevent him doing fw^'ther damage to Italian machines. - j^Siid by the Military Attache to be too nervous to qualify as a pilot. Of the Russians, most, if not all, of whom appear to have been appointed since the arrival of aeroplanes from Russia in October 1924, it is understood that some 20 are intended to be replaced by the 20 Afghan youths sent to Moscow for training in 1925. They were reported in June 1926 by the Military Attache, Kabul, to be employed on three years’ contracts on pay from £42 to £45 a month and housed in the bazaar under conditions that British ranks would not tolerate, but to work hard all day. They are assisted by young'Afghans nominally under instruction, said to hinder more than they help. Four Germans were attached to the Afghan Air Force, prior to the introduction of the Russians, but have since left (of whom one, Dr. Weiss, remained with the Force from 1922 to October 1925 and operated at first the Bristol Fighters bought from His Majesty’s Government, but was apparently eventually ousted by the Russians); also Abdul Qudus, an Indian pilot, recruited in Paris, whither he returned in January 1926, and Patwardhan, a Mahratta, trained in Germany, who was employed till the end of 1926, when his contract expired, in laying out aerodromes. The King asked to be lent the services of the two Royal Air Force officers, who, accompanying Wing-Commander Johnston, R.A.F., flew the Bristol Fighters to Kabul in August 1924. This request was not entertained. The Afghan Government also asked Wing-Commander Johnston if they could obtain British civilian pilots for service during the Khost rebellion. This proposal was dropped owing to the considerable objections to it seen by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, in particular the risk of the pilots’ unpopularity and friction with the authorities and possible political complications if they fell into the hands of the rebels, the Afghan Government being informed that civilian pilots were almost certainly not available in India. Training of Personnel. Afghanistan made ai rangements in 1921 with the Italian Government for the training of three Afghans as pilot, observer and mechanic respectively. These have now joinedtlie Ay'an Air Force. Indeed the pilot is now Chief of the Air Force, though aged ^,*&gt;-(7) only 2o and reported to be of doubtful efficiency. “17 . The Afghan Government-in May 1U24 expressed a desire to send Afghans for flying training to India. The question Was again mentioned at the interviews between the King and Wing-Commander Johnston, who brought the two British Bristol Fighters to Kabul, but postponed for further discussion. It was stated by the Air Ministry (June 1924) that the flying training of Afghan youths in India was not possible at present and must be entirely regulated by the decision of the Indian Government with regard to the flying training of Indians, for which no facilities had been pr added. In a subsequent letter of 28th June the Air Ministry suggested the possibility of providing flying training for a small number of Afghans in Egypt. jG But the estimated cost of £4 a day for pilots compared so unfavourably with the Russian charge, reported to be 800 francs gold per man for the whole course, that the suggestion was not pursued. In April 1925,20 Afghan youths were reported to have been sent to Tashkent, and ultimately to Moscow, for training. The Afghan Minister at Moscow is reported to have informed Sir R. Hodgson recently that these cadets have become demoralised during their stay in Russia, and have not yet learnt to fly. The King was reported in April 1925 to contemplate the construction of an aerodrome at Jalalabad, where a training school could be established under Russian supervision. Though there is now reported to be an aerodrome at Jalalabad, Russian flying personnel are not at present being employed there. There is no evidence of any immediate prospect of Afghans being trained to fly in Afghanistan. Supply of Stores and Spare Parts. When the purchase of British machines was discussed in 1924 the Afghan Government did not propose to instal workshops for maintenance at Kabul, but)to obtain spare parts from India. A list of spare parts required by the Afghan Government 'was sent to India, but apparently purchase was not carried through. The Afghan Government later negotiated the purchase from a Karachi syndicate, together with four derelict aeroplanes, of certain spare engines and parts. These machines, though ordered in September 1924, were not delivered until August 1920, having been stored at Peshawar for over a year. In August 1925 information reached Sir F. Humphrys that, o.ving to the difficulty experienced in Afghanistan in obtaining a high grade of petrol from Russia, efforts were being made to obtain it privately from India through the motor mechanic in Peshawar in charge of the four Karachi aeroplanes. He therefore suggested that it should be considered whether import from India of aviation spirit and aeroplane spares into Afghanistan should be permitted through other than official channels. The question was considered by Mis Majesty’s Government in connection with other measures to check Russian penetration which are mentioned later in this note. It was considered, generally speaking, desirable to facilitate supply of such articles from a British source. Since, however, Russians using them would naturally wish to discredit them, it was recommended either not to supply from Government stocks or to indicate to the Afghan Government that British technical supplies could not be expected to work efficiently in Russian hands. Sir F. Humphrys reported in February 1926 that the Afghan Air Force was immobilised through lack of aviation spirit. He pressed that supplies of articles required only for military aeroplanes in Afghanistan should be controlled, as munitions, under the Anglo-Afghan Treaty or the Indian Aircraft Act. Either alternative appeared to His Majesty’s Government to offer considerable technical difficulties. Meanwhile a further supply of material was asked for by the Afghan Foreign Minister in July 1926, and Sir F. Humphrys was authorised to explain the difficulty ol agreeing to supply such material for a force manned by Bolsheviks In September 1926 the Government ol India, in order to prevent uncontrolled private sales of aircraft to Afghans or Russians, prohibited aircraft and aircraft parts being brought by lap l or flown into the frontier districts, except under licence. A report was received by Sir F. Humphrys in September 1926, through the Indian pilot, Mr. Patwardhan, that aviation spirit and aircraft spares were then being procured from Russia, but that owing to lack of repair shops in Kabul great difficulty was being experienced in keeping machines in order. idi ^ Q Aerodromes and Flying Activity. In Weekly Reports received since 1921 from the British Military Attache, a certain amouut of regular practice flying by the D.H. 9a’s and D.H. 9’s received from Russia 24 has been mentioned. In June 1926 it was reported that the average flying hours monthly during the past year had been 15, that is to say, a monthly average of only 1 hour 40 minutes per pilot. In July 1925 a display was given near Kabul by the Russian aviators, at which eight machines were flown, and the King, two ladies of the Court, the ex-Amir of Bokhara and some Government officers were taken up. Aeroplanes are regularly employed in carrying mails between Kabul and the King s camp when His Majesty is on tour to Jalalabad and Kandahar. The timings of the^d^t journeys are reported to average— Kabul to Kandahar Kabul to Jalalabad Kabul to Tennez - Jalalabad to Kandahar 3 hours. 50 minutes. 2 hours 40 minutes. 31 hours. p ^ioO The Junker monoplane recently carried the Russian Minister from Kabul to Tashkent via Termez, and other machines have succeeded in crossino- the Hindu Kush flying at a height of 5,000 metres. It is possible, travelling by This route t u reach Moscow from Kabul via Tashkent in five days. The British Military Attache reported in June 1926 that the efficiency of 'the Russian pilots’ flying was of a high standard, though no flying in formation or by night was attempted. More recently it has been reported that a valuable collection of aerial photographs has been made by the Russian pilots and is maintained at the Kabul Aerodrome. Proposals have from time to time been under consideration for inaugurating a regular air service between Tashkent and Kabul, although it appears doubtful if a service on this route could be maintained on account of the Hindu Kush barrier An aerodrome is reported to have been laid out near Herat with a view to enabling the German Junker Company in Persia to send a machine from ’Teheran to Kabul on a test flight. 1 he aerodrome at Herat might also serve to assist flying via Kushk and and Kandahar Herat-Kushk, and that it is proposed to initiate regular communications on the first of these routes with effect from 1st May 1927. A , er u odro '' es a . re „ n 1 0 '' saK ] ‘yhay® been constructed at Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Kabul and .Jalalabad, while one has been laid out at Gardez and others are projected at Faizabad and Matun. Ihe potential value of the Afghan Air Service as a fighting force has been variously judged. W rittng ,n June 1926, the British Military Attache considered it to have httle value either U) as an advance squadron of a force based on Tennez or (_) as an Afghan unit; in the latter case because the pilots would have no incentive to take risks when employed to bomb hostile formations. He considered the force could only be used by the Afghans against India if in open alliance with the Soviet in which case, based on Jalalabad and Kandahar, it might in the early stages afve trouble. It would, however, probably have to be reinforced and would then become merged in the Russian horces. Asked by the Indian General Staff to expand these conclusions, Major Dodd pointed out m a note of July 1926, that ( 1 ) the aerodromes hangars &amp;c, set up for the use of the Afghan Air Service in Afghanistan would Tn the event of our havtng to fight Soviet Russia with Afghanistan on our side become very useful to our own Atr force ; (2 )the absence of military training and mili arv equipment in the Afghan horce and the presence on board of Afghan observers wo d hamper its ethcency if it were being used against us in the event of war between s imd the Russians with Aigliani.^tan on their side. G &amp; The Indian General Staff with whom the Royal Air Force in India concur dispute Major Dodd s conclusions. 1 hey think he underrates the potential value of the Air S'emce to Soviet Russia m the event of war against us. The machines, they J,, • could easily be equipped lor bombing, and might, if used in that capacity, exhcise considerable moral effect by their mere appearance over, e.g. Peshawar ' T , v consider that the Afghan aeroplanes must be regarded as a potential menace cam U- of being converted with reinforcements into a “ menace of national importance’’► ? f * * r 5 British Policy as regards Assistance to Aviation in Afghanistan. In a Despatch, No. 56, dated 4th December 1923, His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, expressed the opinion that the King, though for the time being dependent on foreign personnel for organising an Air Force, would get rid of foreign elements in his forces as soon as possible. Sir F. Humphrys thought that the Power which lent the personnel would for the time being attain considerable prestige, but, if casualties occurred among Afghan pupils, would ultimately be discredited. He favoured the presentation ol British materiel to the King, in the shape of aeroplanes flown by British airmen to Kabul, but advised that no responsibility be taken for maintenance, so that the ultimate discredit for accidents or inefficiency might fall on another Power. From this point of view Sir F. Humphrys has not wavered since. In May 1924, at a critical stage in the Khost rebellion, the officiating Foreign Minister, in an interview with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, stated that “the Amir intended to have a great number of aeroplanes—about 40—in time, and to obtain them all through the British Government. But at the moment he required only six.” He asked whether these six machines could be delivered “ in 10 or 15 days,” and added that “the Amir would be most grateful if Afghans could be tiained in flying in India. Ihe attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the question of training has already been described. As regards the supply of British aeroplanes, which had been contemplated as a possibility by His Majesty’s Minister, serious difficulty arose from the strong objection seen by the Foreign Office to a proposal which involved their being handed over to German pilots—at the time the only trained personnel in Afghanistan—in view of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. Eventually, in July 1924, the Afghan Government were informed that the exact types of machine which they required were not available, but that His Majesty’s Government would be glad to meet their requirements as far as possible, and suggested that an officer of the Royal Air Force should visit Kabul to discuss the matter. Owing to the situation in Khost the matter became urgent. Wino-- Commandei Johnston i\ns sent to Kabul m August, and an agreement was reached, for the sale to the Afghan Government of two Bristol Fighters. These were flown to Kabul on 22nd August 1924 by British officers, who gave the German pilots some instruction in their handling before departure. Early in September the Afghan Goveinment asked roi another Bristol kighter on the same terms, but were informed that it could not be spared. The British Government having then, by its own action, closed for the time beincr the question of further British assistance in regard to both materiel and personnel, , the field was left to the Russians, who from that time onwards have supplied Afghanistan with both, the latter probably in excess of the King’s own desires. The King said, in an interview with Sir F. Humphrys on 16th November 1924 that “he would have much preferred British aviators.” It is, however, probable,' as Sir K Humphrys said m December 1923, that he would much prefer to do without either. When, on 22nd June 1925, the Cabinet considered various questions relating to Afghanistan, arising out of a memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for India, it was decided, in relation to the development of the Russian 'connection with the Afghan Air Force, that “ for the moment, there should be no change in policy as regards aerial assistance to the Amir, but that the situation should be' kept under careful observation with a view to reconsideration of the policy if this should prove necessary or desirable.” In October 1925 the Government of India, referring to the ^rsistent infiltration of Russian persomu l into Afghanistan, said that in their opinion he time had come when they could no longer afford fo let it develop without attempt! g o arrest its progress. 1 hey considered there were three alternatives, viz (a) to sa., t iat the presence of Russian personnel in the Air Force was in effect unfriendly and provocative, {b) to say that they would not allow transit of aeroplanes, spare parts or spirit through India to Afghanistan without a written guarantee that they would not fall into the hands of the Russians, (c) to say that the presence of Russian aviation personnel, like that of Russian Consulates, in the south-eastern province would be regarded as provocative and unfriendly, and that, unless it were got. rid of in a reasonable time. His Majesty’s Government would have to take their stand on treaty rights, and adjust their attitude accordingly. The first course was thought too drastic, the second ineffectual owing to the increasing possibility of Russian supplies. The third was believed by 23^5$ 0 r6 the Government of India to be the most practicable because consistent with the general policy and likely to render employment of Russians very, difficult. ^ At the « same time it was urged that the employment of Germans, to which, out of peg^rd for the Versailles Treaty, His Majesty’s Government had taken strong, objection, was the only practical alternative to that of Russians, or British, neither of which could be otherwise than provocative to the other party. ‘ His Majesty’s Government’s. Views as regards the- third alternative, expressed ^ in Secretary of State’s telegram dated 2nd December 1925, were a$ follows : “ In view of fact that British attitude towards Afghan enquiries for aeroplanes and aviators has hitherta.been rather unresponsive, that Russians seem at present to be only 'personnel available, and that we have taken no objection to their employment in general, I cannot help feeling that Afghans would have good ground for saying that proposed attitude was unreasonable.” Moreover, objection was still seen to the employment of German personnel. It was thought preferable “ to rely rather on steady pursuance of friendly policy on our side,” and to show a greater readiness in training Afghans to fly British machines and also in the supply of aeroplanes and spare parts, in pursuit of the policy of rendering the Afghan Air Force independent of foreign personnel. Sir F. Humphrys, however, in a telegram dated Nth December 1925, urged that British effort should be directed “ not to establishing British connection with the Afghan Air Force, but to restricting, by fair and reasonable means (in the general interest of Afghanistan as well as India), the sphere of Russian activity with that force. This should lead ultimately to disappearance of Russian personnel and the Afghan Military Air Force would die a natural and unlamented death. With novelty wearing off and lighter pocket the Amir might become reconciled to possession of, say, four aeroplanes, which could accompany him on his tours and take part in ceremonial displays, idiots in charge would have to be foreigners for many years to come. This is all that the Amir can afford without foreign subsidies. British co-operation in civil aviation might be advisable at a later stage.” For these reasons Sir F. Humphrys supported the view of the Government of India, that the Afghan Government should be warned against the employment of Russian aviation personnel in. the south-eastern zone, though he advised omission of any reference to treaty rights. Ultimately, on 24tli December 1925, His Majesty’s Government authorised Sir F. Humpbrys to say that “ we should regard Rushan aviation personnel in the south eastern zone very unfavourably.” For the time being the warning did not have to be given. Jluring the state of tension between Afghanistan and Russia which ensued on the Urta Tagai incident the Russian aviation personnel was suspended from duty. On 4th March 1920, most of the Russian aviation personnel having been reinstated on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Urta Tagai, Sir F. Humphrys saw the King and extracted from him a solemn promise as follows:—“ Russian airmen would never be allowed to visit Kandahar, Ghazni or Jalalabad except on temporary duty to carry mails to and from Kabul when he was on tour. They would not be permitted to fly anywhere beyond the direct line between these places and the capital or to remain for a day anywhere in the south-eastern zone, except when in personal attendance on himself.” The King was reported to have promised that he would get rid of every Russian out of his Air Service as soon as he could obtain efficient substitutes. He deplored the great expense involved in maintenance of the Air Force, and hoped that the Afghan pupils in Moscow would soon return. Others, would be sent to France and Italy for training. The King’s intention to get rid of the Russian aviators as soon as possible was reiterated at another interview accorded to. Sir F. Humphrys on 25th June. His Majesty hoped to replace them by substitutes from other countries or preferably by the young Afghan pupils trained in Moscow. Reference has already been made to the discussion as regards supply of aircraft stores to Afghanistan which took place during the summer of 1926, and ended with Sir F. Humphrys, on 14th September, pointing out to the Afghans the absurdity of expecting the British Government to act as a feeder to a Russian controlled air force. It remains to mention the Afghan purchase from a Karachi syndicate of four useless aeroplanes. This purchase was sanctioned by the Afghan Government in September 1924, i.e., before the intensified Russian activity in the Air Force, although the Afghan Government was warned by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, when informed of the transaction, that the aeroplanes, part of a stock presented to the Government of India by His Majesty’s Government in 1920 and subsequently handed over free of charge to the Karachi Aviation Syndicate, were valueless. The machines lay at Peshawar until August 1926, during which time they suffered further deterioration through damage by a storm. Sir F. Humphrys in December 1925 wasstrongly opposed to allowing an attempt by the firm to fly them to Afghanistan, which he considered to be sure to lead to a disaster damaging to British prestige. Ultimately the machines were delivered by road in August 1926, and are, as anticipated, reported to be useless. But the risk of a disaster with them injurious to British prestige lias been avoided by their becoming altogether immobile. A The above summary shows that the policy advocated to His Majesty’s Government ^uy Sir 1. Humphrys in 1923 has on the whole been followed consistently. Opportunity has occurred to demonstrate by a flight to Kabul the efficiency of British aircraft, but there has been no attempt to enter into competition with Russia in the free supply of aircraft or in providing personnel. In the meantime the Russian element in the Afghan Air Force has, if the King’s recent statements are to be credited, to some extent outstayed its popularity, especially since the Urta Tagai incident. However, it is yet to be seen if the Afghan personnel now under training jn Russia will ever be fit to replace the Russian pilots, or whether other foreigners will have to be recruited instead of them. Although the possibility of flying over the Hindu Kush and of linking Moscow with Kabul in five days’journey by air has on occasion been demonstrated, and aerodromes have been constructed in various places in Afghanistan, it can hardly be said that aviation in its present form has been acclimatised in the country as a national enterprise, or that the Russians at present in the employment of the Afghan Government as pilots have secured a permanent looting. This consideration should perhaps be borne in mind in estimating the risk to India, as seen in August 1920 by the Indian General Stair, from the presence of Russian pilots in the Afghan Air Service. It should also be mentioned that there is certain recent information (the value of which it is impossible to gauge exactly), indicating that the Russians themselves are dissatisfied with the treatment accorded by the Afghan Government to their personnel and with the efficiency of the materiel of the Afghan Air Service, and are contemplating the possibility of having to withdraw their support from it in the near future. In the event of this situation arising, opportunity would be afforded to test the correctness of Sir F. Humphrys * prediction in Uecember 1925, that with the disappearance of the Russian personnel the Afghan Military Air Force would die a “natural and unlamented death,” the materiel being too costly and the personnel requiring too technical and arduous training for the economic and educational resources of Afghanistap.1 * HUT AW/iY JVtTH Minute Paper.

Patwardhan, a P^hratta trained in aviation in Berlin, seems a useful source of information; it wouldprobably be a good thing for us if he should extend his contract to serve in Afghanistan for two years more. His statement that there are about 100 Russians in Herat is interesting; we have never had any reliable information as to the numbers of the ^colony 1 * there. It is quite certain that the Russians look very much askance at any possibility of Grerman intervention, whether competitive or co-operative, in aviation in Afghanistan; but intervention will be less easy to ride off if &gt;■****'£ I if Patwardhan is correct in his belief that a regular commercial service across the Hindu Kush is impracticable and that the western route from Termez through Kushk ; Herat and Kandahar must be used. Though the Russians nave crossed the Hindu Kush several times with success for special trips, it must be remembered that two of their machines failed to cross when being delivered by air from Termez to Kabul. Patwardhan does not confirm the report that an aerodrome is to be made at Kahi, in Ningrahar; but when Sir F.Humphrys mentioned the report of the project to the King, His Majesty did not deny it. It will be interesting to see whether the Afghan youths now under training in Russia return as capable pilots; even if they do, the Afghans must still depend on foreigners for ground staff.

I have the honour to transmit a note which purports to summarise the im pressions of an educated Indian who is employed in the Afghan air force. An interesting point which was emphasized by Mr. Patwardhan is the imminent probability, according to local opinion, of Russo-German competition to establish an air service for mails and passengers between Kabul and Europe. It is a remarkable testimony to the capabilities of modern aircraft that the Russian Minister and his wife have recently been enabled to make two separate journeys by aeroplane and rail from Kabul to Moscow within five days. Formerly this journey occupied about thirty days, and was attended by the severest hardships. 0 » Secretary of State for India 2. A copv ol this despatch is being sent to the „ T —*— r ° ' Government of India Enclosure to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul’s Despatch No. 92, dated the ^7th September, 1926. Mr. Patwardhan, an Indian who is employed as a pilot in the Afghan Air Force, came to see me a few days ago. He had recently returned from Herat, where he had been sent to make an aerodrome. It took him sixteen days to ride from Kandahar to Herat. He said that the road was fair and might be made lit for motor traffic in a few months if the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages were turned out by order to assist. Some sprt of bridge or boat over the Helmund would, however, be required. A motor could get through in the dry season of the year even now as far as Girishk. There were about a hundred Russians in Herat, and the telegraph line, on which fifty of them were employed, had reached a place seventy miles south of Herat. The poles were of ferro concrete. He returned via the Hazarajat in eighteen days. This route, he said, would be unsuitable for flying over, as it would be difficult to construct emergency landing-grounds for the greater part of the distance, and aeroplanes would have to fly at a great height in order to get o’ver the mountains. He un derstood that the principal reason for the construction of the Herat aerodrome was to make it possible for the German Junker Company to send a machine from Teheran to Kabul on a test flight. The Afghans, hoped to be able to use this route later for a cheap and quick trip to Europe. The Russians were not pleased at this prospect and were considering the possibility of an air service between Tashkent and Kabul. He did not think that any regular passenger service over the Hindu Kush was feasible, but the aeroplanes might fly vid^ Termez, Kushk, Herat and Kandahar. Monsjeur Stark, who had left Kabul with his Secretary in the Junker monoplane on the 15th September, had flown to Termez in 2-3|4 hours, and after a short halt there, had flown on to Tashkent in 5-1 12 hours,. A telegram had been received on the 19th by the Russians to say that he had arrived safely in Moscow. This meant that he had reached Moscow in less than five days’ actual travelling from Kabul. Mr. Patwardhan said that he had constructed an excellent aerodrome ten miles from Herat, the labour being given free by the villagers. Each village provided a contingent, which worked for three days, and brought its own food. It was the intention of the Afghan Government to maintain a iorce of twenty- four aeroplanes eventually, and they had invited subscriptions for the purchase of the extra machines from all parts of Afghanistan. Up to the present Herat had contributed three lakhs and Kandahar six lakhs. There were now good aerodromes at Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Gtiazni, Kabul, and Jalalabad ; and he was being sent to the Southern Province shortly to construct aerodromes at Gardez and_ Matum He had not heard of any sugestion that an aerodrome should be made at Kahi, or anywhere to the east of Jalalabad. The Afghan Air Force was essentially a military force, and was intended to cope with internal disorders. The Russians employed in the Afghan Air Force had many years’ experience as pilots and mechanics, and their work was first class. The best pilot was Arawatoff, who generally piloted the Junker machine and had taken Monsieur Stark to Tashkent. Both he and his mechanic had nine years’ aviation ex perience.

There were still no repair shops in Kabul, and the Russians had great difficulty m maintain ing the machines in proper order. The machines recently received from India, ri? the -9’s and Avros purchased from Mr. Murphy, were quite useless. The Bus&amp;an pilots had told him that 100 h. p. Monos/upape Avro engines were too low-powered for Kabul. The Russians in the Afghan Air Force had a very hard time, and the con- ditions in which they lived were most unsatisfactory. He thought that it was the intention of the Afghan Government to dispense with the services ot then Russian personnel when the Afghan students returned tnim Moscow. This was expected some time next year. It was has conviction, however that Afghans would never make first-class aero mechanics, and that, at any late for 5 manv years to come, they would be compelled to retain the services ot expert European personnel to look after the machines on the ground, and keep them in dying trim. It was quite possible that the young Afghans who would shortly 1 return from Russia would he able to do the actua Hying, bu no more.

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble .^ervciit, The Political Secretary, India Office, London. Uo.46, dated the 26th June, 1926.-/i(i MrVbl ? 7 Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 46, dated the 26th June 1926. I have the honour to transmit an interesting note on the subject of the Afghan air force, which has been written by Major P. C. R. Dodd, D.S.O., Military Attache to this Legation. This force has now been in complete charge of the Russians for about twelve months, and its performance of the limited duties assigned to it must be considered as very creditable. So far as my information goes, the Afghan Government have kept a careful watch over the activities of the Russian personnel, especially in the south-eastern zone, with a view to preventing them from indulg ing in anti-British propaganda. 2 . The future of the Afghan air force is still a matter for speculation. The Amir is credited with the determination to extract from the Soviet four more aeroplanes which he considers are still due under the terms of the Russo-Afghan Treaty. It is also reported that he is negotiating for the purchase of aeroplanes and aviation stores in Europe, and that his ultimate ambition is to possess a force of 36 military machines. 3. On the other hand, I believe that the Amir has definitely made up his mind to get rid of the Russian personnel at the earliest possible opportunity. He hopes to be able to do this when the young Afghans who have been sent to Moscow for training return to Kabul as qualified pilots and mechanics. He probably realises that it will still be necessary to retain in his service a few European experts to build and supervise repair shops and maintain the machines in flying trim. But if these experts are to be drawn from countries other than Russia, which appears to be the present aim of the Afghan Government, it seems inevitable that the Soviet will withdraw their financial support. 4. If the Afghan air force is to be dependent on Afghan revenues alone for its and Government of India. Enclosure to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul’s Despatch No. 46, dated the Throughout the Amir’s stay at Jalalabad, from April 20 th to June 8 th, 1926, communication with Kabul was regularly maintained by aeroplane service, involv ing over 30 hours’ hying. This follows closely on the first attempt of the Afghan air force to run an air mail service, i.e., during the Amir’s visit to Kandahar in November, 1925, the approximate flying time carried out during this service being nearly 50 hours ; and which also met with complete success. The result of these ventures suggests that the standard of flying efficiency of the Soviet-controlled Afghan air force is high. It may therefore be of interest, at this period, to review the constitution of this force and its potentialities. The origination of the service was a result of the vanity of the Amir wdiose desire to control an air force is not without precedent amongst Eastern rulers lack ing the financial ability to do so. Its continuation was made possible through Soviet support—a phase of their anti-British policy. Equipment and supplies. —The first aeroplanes to arrive in Afghanistan are now for practical purposes useless. These were a Sopwith Ij strutter and a Nieuport Scout which were presented by the U. S. S. R. under the terms of the Soviet-Afghan treaty of 1921 and arrived in Kabul in 1922, and two Caproni Scouts which were purchased in Italy in June 1922. The Afghans next attempted to salve an aeroplane which arrived d anntically in Afghanistan in 1921, when a British pilot forced landed in a BAstol Fighter at ' ” * j have maintenance, I am of opinion that it will quickly dwindle to the half-dozen machines which should be sufficient for all practical purposes for the needs of Afghanistan in the country’s present state of development. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary of State for India 26th June 1926. Note on the Afghan Air Force. ever flown.2 The following machines constitute the effective equipment of the service at the present time : Two Bristol Fighters which were sold to the Afghan Government by the Govern ment of India in 1924, one of which crashed near Gardes in September, 1924, when piloted by the German, vVeisz, but was not rendered irreparable. Since then, one Bristol Fighter has been flown about three times ; the other one is not in serviceable condition. This is probably due to the fact that the Russians are disinclined to work on these machines and prefer to allow them to remain unserviceable as evidence (in Afghan eyes) of the inferiority of machines obtained from other than Russian sources. All the ramaining machines of the service are believed to have been pre sented to the Afghan Government under the Soviet Afghan treaty terms. These are : Four D. H.- 9 ’s with 240 h. p. Siddeley Puma engines which arrived in Kabul in October 1924. One Junker six-seater monoplane and four D. H.-9a s (400 h. p. Liberty engines) wdiich were flown from Termez to Kabul in July 1925. In addition, one D. H.-9a forced landed and crashed at Tashkurgan and one at Haibak during this flight, and it is not thought that they have been salved. Two D. H.- 9 a’s which were flown to Kabul from Termez in October, 1925. As far as is known, therefore, the effective equipment of the air force is : 6 D. H.-9a’s (400 h. p. Liberty). 4 D. H.-9’s (240 h. p. Siddeley Puma). 1 Junker (185 h. p. ? ). 2 Bristol Fighters (R. R. Falcon 111 ). Of these, the following were reported to be in flying condition during the Amir’s visit to Jalalabad:— 4 D. H.-9a’s. 2 D. H.-9’s. 1 Junker. 1 Bristol Fighter. No spare engines are in Kabul and when required they will have to be brought from Termez either by camel convoy or by flying a machine there for installation of a new engine. Aeroplane and engine spares and petrol and oil are, of course, only obtainable from Russian or British sources. The Russian supply is strictly curtailed owing to the fact that the journey from the frontier to Kabul entails 12 days’ travel over a road traversing passes of the Hindu Kush which are closed for several months of the year. The road is impassable for mechanical transport and all material has to be carried on camels or ponies. Convoys have lately been seen bringing petrol in large quantities from the North, via Bamian and the Unai, each camel in the convoy carrying two 15-gallon tanks. Armament .—No bomb racks are fitted nor have any of the machines seen at close range any fittings for automatic rifles. Although nothing is known of any reserve equipment or bombs, they very probably exist, and during the Khost rebellion some bombs were dropped in a field near the rebels. The Bristol Fighters were handed over to the Afghan Government with fighting equipment. It may be assumed that this force can be turned into a fighting unit rapidly and secretly. Distinguishing marks —All machines have their numbers in large Arabic letter ing and the crest of Afghanistan painted in white on the sides of the fuselag 3 . The words “ Allah Akbar ” are written in large, white, Arabic lettering on the bottom of each main plane. Personnel .—The Afghan personnel of this service are the Commandant, Muhammad Ihsan, a youth who after two years' training in Italy was deemed to be a fully-trained pilot as a preventive measure against his doing any further damage to Italian machines ; Muhammad Hashim, who was also under taining in3 « Italy fcr a period ard who s advertised as an observer, being too nervous to qualify as a pilot and Ghulam Dastgir who is said to be an aeronautical engineer. Theie are about 25 Afghan aeronautical students in Moscow, and a number doing elementary training in Kabul ; but it will be many years before the Afghans will be able to run an air force without European assistance, if they are ever able to do so. Other than Russian, no skilled European personnel are now employed with the Afghan air force. Two Germans who were the first skilled personnel of the service (Weisz and Linthe) have left Afghanistan since the advent of Soviet control ; probably as a result of Soviet machinations. Brustmann, a German mechanic, was killed in Kabul by another member of the German colony before Weisz and Linthe had left. An Indian pilot (Abdul Qudus) left Kabul very shortly after it was demons trated that he could handle an aeroplane as efficiently as the Russians themselves. Another Indian (Patwardhan), who as far as is known has never carried out other than dual control flying, is still with the service, and is usually employed on the construction of aerodromes. The only personnel in Afghanistan, therefore, able to fly and maintain the machines of the air force, are Russians. These are said to number 25, of whom 9 pilots and 9 mechanics are said to be available (i.e., excluding men on leave, sick, etc.) at this date. The pilots do a great deal of work on the machines and both pilots and mechanics appear to work all and every day. They have as assistants young Afghans nominally under instruction, but who hinder more than they help. The Russian pilots and mechanics work on a three years' contract and receive pay ranging from £42 to £45 per month. They are treated by the Afghans in a manner that no British rank would stand and are badly housed in the bazaar. Nevertheless, they appear fairly contented and ready to renew their contracts. They are undoubtedly first class, picked men of great experience and very efficient. Training and efficiency .—What is known of the air force may give some data on which to base a rough estimate of its efficiency, The average monthly flying hours from May 1925, to May 1926, are 15 hours. It is probable that the monthly average number of effective pilots for this period was 9 . The very small monthly average of 1 hour 40 minutes flying per pilot is thus deduced. Flying is intermittently carried out, but, as already stated, has included mail services to Jalalabad and Kandahar on the occasions of the Amir's visits. The following are the reported timings of some of the flights recently carried out: Kabul to Jalalabad .. .. .. 50 minutes. KaKul to Kandahar .. .. .. 3 hours. Kabul to Termez • .. .. .. 2 hours 40 minutes. Jalalabad to Kandahar .. .. .. 3 hours 30 minutes. The pilots have not been observed to carry out any formation flying or, except on one occasion, aerobatics j this is probably due to the fact that they are content to let well alone, bearing in mind the difficulty they experience in keeping machines in the air for straightforward flying. No night flying is ever done. There are no properly fitted workshops, overhauls and repairs being carried out under most adverse conditions. Workshops will undoubtedly soon be built in Kabul ; in fact, foundations of what appear to be workshops* are now under construction in alignment with the hangars on the Kabul aerodrome. Aerodromes .—First class aerodromes have been made at Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar, and one is in course of construction at Herat. There are hangars to accommodate all machines at Kabul, and j^angars sufficient to accommodate a flight have been built at Jalalabad and are under construction at Kandahar. Emergency landing grounds are known at Gardez and Ghazni. Records do not show that these landing grounds have ever been used. Other landing grounds are said to exist, but have not been visited and are quite problematical. MC248FDThe Kabul aerodrome is under snow normally for a period of three months. It is understood that the Russians are providing snow skids for the machines in Kabul. No aeroplanes are permanently accommodated at any other station than Kabul. Uniform. —The uniform of the air force, worn by the Russians and Afghans alike, consists of a drab khaki coat and trousers and black boots. The coat has large, sky-blue collar on which are small, brass star badges of rank and small brass wings. The commander of the air force always wears, and other officers have been seen wearing, dark blue coat and trousers, with collar and tie, and wings on the left breast. Conclusions. —The maintenance of this force must involve the Soviet in a large expenditure, and they must expect some return for their money; where this lies it is difficult to determine. The value of the force as propaganda is considerable, but as an advanced squadron of a large fighting force based, say, on Termez, its effectiveness is doubtful. As an Afghan fighting force it can have little value. As was done once or twice during the Khost rebellion of 1924-25, a machine might be armed and sent up against a rebellious tribe, but, as before, there being no incentive to foreign pilots to take undue risks, bombs would probably be unloaded on a position suffici ently far from the objective to be safe. A very high Afghan official was of opinion that if the machines were armed and sent up, they might as likely damage Kabul or friendly troops, and even might disappear towards Russia. In its present state this air force could not be used against India by the Afghans unless in open alliance with the Soviet, when, based on Jalalabad and Kandahar, it might in the early phases be troublesome and meet with some temporary success, but, under these circumstances, it would be considerably reinforced and cease to exist as an Afghan air force. Forecast.- —The only increase in the Afghan air force which is likely to materialise in the near future will be the two D. H.-9’s and two Avro’s which were purchased from Captain Murphy and the Avro which was pres 3 nted privately to the Afghan Government; these are being brought to Kabul by road from Peshawar where they have been stored for some months. That these machines can be rendered ser viceable is doubtful. In addition to the Soviet, other nations continue to compete for contracts with the Afghan air force, more particularly the Germans who would probably be looked on with favour were German pilots not debarred from entering the Afghan forces by the treaty of Versailles. The Junker Company from Persia are said to be try ing to obtain a footing by tendering a contract for air mails. The question of the supply of spare parts and petrol from Russian sources which now presents some difficulty may be facilitated by the construction of the road over the Salang pass of the Hindu Kush, joining Jabal-us-Siraj with the Haibak valley and thence to Termez. This*road has lately been considerably improved by the Russians, no less than 40 of whom are said to be employed in the construction and further survey of the road. Construction over the pass itself has not yet begun. (Signed) P. C. R. DODD, Major, Military Attache, British Legation, Kabul., To His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Kabul. MV-Wl'D—20—13-7-2C—GIP3(82) 40 f f. /3 l£ Kabul, 12th December, 1924. No. 145. Sir, I have the honour to transmit a note which I have written on the subject of aviation in Afghanistan. Such a note would ordinarily be best written by the Military Attache, but Major Harvey Kelly has only been in Kabul for one week, and has, therefore, been unable to form any conclusions on the subject. Enclosure No. 1 to His Majesty’s Minister Kabul’s Despatch, No. 145, The following note is based on information recently communicated to me from reliable sources in Kabul. Of the two Bristol Fighters which were sold by the Government of India to the Afghan Government in August, 1924, it will be remembered that one was crashed at Gardez by Dr. Weisz on 14th September, owing to the emergency landing ground being much smaller than was anticipated. The propeller and under carriage of this machine were damaged, and it was found impossible, owing to the rebellion, to get the necessary spares out to Gardez by road and to fly the machine back to Kabul. It was accord ingly dismantled a few days ago, brought in to Kabul on camels, and handed over to the Russian mechanics for repairs. It seems improbable that it will ever fly again. The second Bristol Fighter, which was reported in Military Attache’s Diary No. 42 of 1924 to be out of action, has been overhauled and has been flown by Dr. Weisz on three occasions during the last few days. Of the five machines, viz., two Caproni Scouts, one Sopwith 1 J strutter, one Nieuport Scout, and one Bristol Fighter (which made a forced landing in Afghanistan in 1921), which w'ere in the possession of the Afghan Govern ment prior to August, 1924, none have left the ground, nor, with the possible exception of the Sopwith, seem likely to do so. It is understood that they have been handed over to the newly arrived Russian personnel. The Russian aviators, as reported in Military Attache’s Diary No. 37 of 1924, arrived in Kabul on 1st October, with five machines which they flew from Termez. Of these, the Junker passenger monoplane is making short flights. The other four are British D. H. 9s, with 240 h. p. Puma engines, three of which are in flying trim and have recently flown about twice a week, while the fourth is damaged. These machines are usually flown by Russian pilots, and occasionally by an Afghan who was trained in aviation in Italy. There is considerable friction between Dr. Weisz and the Russian aviators. The former claims a special bonus due under his contract for ten flights which he made in the Bristol Fighters in the war area in Khost, but the Afghans refuse, for some reason which he attributes to the jealousy of the Russians, to pay him for more than two flights. He has applied for 2. A copy of this Despatch I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sd.) F. H. HUMPHRYS. The Right Honourable Austen Chamberlain, P. C., etc., etc. DATED THE 12TH DECEMBER, 1924. Aviation in Afghanistan. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No. 7 jy| Dated 28 JAN 1925 Receive!41 three months’ leave to Germany due under his contracit, but, as the Afghan Government have not made up their mind when to dispense with his ser vices, he has received nothing but evasive replies. Brustmann, the second German aviator referred to in the correspondence ending with Kabul tele gram No. 196, dated the 18th October, 1924 (S No. 253, Part XVI), has not yet learnt to fly. A new aerodrome, with seven hangars, is being constructed on the site o l the old Sherpur Cantonment. Its position strikes me as being peculiarlv unsuitable, as it lies under the lee of the Bemaru heights, and the prevailing wind is from the north. It is understood that the present excellent aerodrome at Khwaja Rawash, three miles to the north of Kabul, is to be abolished, and that the new site has been selected by the Amir owing to its proximity to the Palace, in order that in case of emergency His Majesty w ill be able to leave the Capital by aeroplane with a minimum of risk. Dr Grobba has recently been requested by the Afghan Government to make enquiries from the Junker Company in Germany regarding the establishment of a regular mail service of aeroplanes between Berlin and Kabul, schedule times to be as follows: — Berlin . . . Moscow Moscow . t . Tashkent Tashkent . . , Termez Termez . , . Kabul . 2 days. • 2—3 days. 1 day. . 1 day. Dr. Grobba informs me that he replied that such a service could not be established without the concurrence of the Soviet Government, and asked whether he was at liberty to consult his Russian colleague first. The Afghan Foreign Minister replied that he did not wish the Russians to be brought into the scheme. As such a service could not possibly be instituted without the co-operation of the Soviet Government, Dr. Grobba thinks that the Afghan Government is merely trying to obtain a tender from a German firm in order that it may check any figures which may be subsequently quoted to it by the Russians. Dr. Grobba told me that he was emphatically of opinion that no private company could possibly afford, without a heavy subsidy, to undertake such a service with Kabul as a terminus. He thought it might conceivably be made to pay were it continued to India, but he undeistood fiom me that this was out of the question m present circum stances. He remarked that the Russians in Kabul claim that both the Junker machine and the D. H.-9s. recently made over to the Afghan Government are of Russian make, though the Afghans are aware that this is not the case. Dr Grobba thinks that similar suggestions will be made by the Afghan Government for continuing the Junker service recently instituted between Germany and l eheran via Meshed, Herat, and Kandahar to Kabul, but he does not regard this as a commercial proposition. In casual conversation recently, Mahmud Tarzi, the Afghan Foreign Minister, told me that he did not think that the Afghan Government could afford to maintain a fleet of military aeroplanes in permanent commission. It would probably be sufficient, he said, if they possessed two or three aero planes which could deal with emergencies like the Khost rising My personal opinion is that the Amir has not yet made up his mind either as to what he wants or what he can afford. His policy in this, as in other matters, will be dictated by the whims and fancied needs oi the moment. He would probably like to see aerial mail and passenger services established with India and Russia in order to advertise the importance of his country, but he has nothing but the vaguest ideas as to how this'could be brought about, and he is reluctant at present to allow any foreign aviators to fly in Afghanistan unless they are the servants of the Afghan Government. As regards military machines, he dislikes the feeling that his Capital is at the mercy of an aerial attack from India, and yet he has no notion how to set about the formation of an efficient Afghan Air Force, and is too suspicious of foreigners to be guided by their advice. It is quite likely,42 as Mahmud Tarzi hints, that he may eventually content himself with the possession of a small number of aeroplanes. These would be primarily for purposes ot internal security, though in the event of hostilities with Great ri am becoming imminent, they might be used for a surprise bombing ? i^ c f ] n f es hawar. J&lt;or the defence of his Capital, the Amir will pro- y re y on anti-aircraft batteries, however ineffectual he may suspect them 0 e. in any case, I do not consider that Afghanistan possesses, or is 1 e y o possess, either the financial or technical resources for equipping an main aunng even a diminutive Air Force without the assistance of oreign money and foreign personnel. The personnel might be collected lorn any European country, but the money could presumably only come (Sd.) F. H. HUMPHRYS. 1143 Telegram R. No. 12, dated the 6th January 1925.
