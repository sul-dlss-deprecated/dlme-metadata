BAHRAIN . Shaikh should be informed that Petroleum Conoassi one Limited having ask.d Hia Kajeaty'a Government for permission to approach Hie 3xcellency with a view to negotia ting for unallotted aree on basis of draft oonoession submitted have been informed that His Majesty's Government have no objection to their doing so. Presumably holmes will require to approach Shaikh through Political Agent in the first instance but having done so might conduct detailed negotiations direct while keeping Political Agent informed of their pr ogress • MUSCAT . There ie no objection to Company approaching Sultan. 5. TRUCIAX SHAIKHDQMS . When question of option has been disposed of (see my telegram No.832 dated 7th March) there i« /i B no objection to Holmoa opening negotiation* with -ihaiKae whom he would invite to Bahrain for the purpose. He should aajce hie first approach to them through Political Agent, wno should be kept in close touch with progress of negotiations. The preliminary conclusions have been reached at tins stage on questions of U) boundaries U) protection. A. regerds (1) it will be sufficient at this stage to define areas of concession as those of respectire Sheikhdoms without annexed maps but eventually it will be desirable to define boundary eo far as possible and His Majesty’s Government accordingly suggest that Resident should, take steps as soon as possible to enquire into boundaries of various Shaikhdoms Inter,s^ and vis a vis Muscat. question of boundary between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia would depend on course of negotiations with Xbn Saud. As regards (2) His Majesty’s Government are inclined to view that so far as possible all responeinility for protection should be placed by concession agreement on /3 ~ S &amp; j c 2- Shaikhs themselves (compare Article 15 of draft concessions /b*fr B 3 and condition (c) attached to approval of option) but provision could also be made in political agreements and in accompanying exchange of letters between aovernment and Shaikhs concerned that any movement of CompEiny , « employee*, entailing special risks (e#g. penetration xxk i or more than a certain distance into the hinterland) should be subject to prior written permission of Shaikh, who would thus be responsible for saying where Company could operate and consequently (in the event of any incident occurring) for taking all possible action against the culprits and paying any compensation which His Majesty* s Government might consider necessary.

Moreover it would be embarrassing vis a vis Petroleum Concessions to stimulate an auction by making a communication to the Bahrain Petroleum Company* Subject to your views therefore we would not propose to take initiative in doing so. 3. Bahrain Petroleum Company will presumably soon hear the news, especially as Shaikh may wish to ask them for a counter offer. If they decide to do so theirnegotiator might be allowed after making first approach through Political Agent to deal with Shaikh direct in the same manner as Holmes.

You will, no douot, dr aw the attention of the Bahrein Government to the opinion and suggestion of the Legal Adviser. It seems clearly desirable to avoid any danger or a serious conflict of rights in the event of Petroleum Concessions Limited ootaining and operating a concession. The sheikh will no douot see the advantage of having a specific clause to prevent any overlapping, i.e. to make it clear that the rights already vested in the Bahrein Petroleum Company, so far as they go, cannot be limited by any grant to the second concessionaire in any case where a e Hon*ble Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.W. powle, C.B.E.,conflict may occur. How this would work out in practice must a of course, be left to the people on the spot to judge. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and Loch.iiu£TRi^C T FROM l\iGTiii 13Y LxjGAIj RATiiD 16TH IviiiRCH, 1936. - The present Bahrein lease of 29th December 5 . 1934, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company is mainly, but not entirely, confined to rights over the T7 leased area u . There are cercain rights v/hich extend to TI any oart of the territories under the control of the sheikh”. These are in Articles I and II of the Lease. In negotiating the new concession, which I understand is to cover all the remaining territories of the Sheikh in Banrein, ^Oi.ib reservation should be ms-de of pre'existing' rights under the lease - something similar to what is contemplated in Article 22(a), paragraph 2, of the draft ✓ concession - e •S• eights conferred by this agreement are in all respects subject to the rights of the Bahrein Petroleum Company under the lease dated the 29th December, 1934, and shall be so exercised as not to damage, impede or interfere with the property, operations and interests of the said Company in respect of their rights under the said lease. A rticle 3 of the draft. t/7hat does 'cognate substances” mean? Article 22 of the draft contemplates the possibility of concessions in the future to other parties of other substances that might discovered. The Qatr clause has 'everything which is extracted therefrom'. The Kuwait commercial agreement has 'cognate substances'. The Bahrein lease has 'other bituminous materials.”P.Z. 1834/1936. Dear Mr. Skliros? Would you kindly refer to the correspondence resting with your letter of the 6th March about the Bahrein Concession for which your Company desires to apply? 2. I am now able to inform you that instructions have been issued to the Political Agent? Bahrein? to inform the Sheikh that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to Major Holmes approaching His Excellency with a view to negotiating a concession on the basis of the draft enclosed with your letter of the 30th January. The way is thus clear for you to instruct Major Holmes. He will be required to approach the Sheikh through the Political Agent in the first instance? having done so might conduct detailed negotiations direct (if the Sheikh is agreeable)? but should keep the Political Agent informed of their progress. Ho concession can? of course? be finally concluded without the specific further approval of His Majesty’s Government? who will require the Company to enter into a Cs INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL? S.W. 1. 19th March, 1936. liros? Esq.2 . separate 'political 11 agreement with them. Steias are about to be taken to draft this agreement. 3. You will, of course, understand that His Majesty 1 s Government do not necessarily concur in the details of the draft concession, which is in any case a matter for the Sheikh 1 s consideration. I should, however, inform you that, according to the legal advice given to us, it will probably be desirable to add a clause to the draft with the object of ensuring that no clash of rights can occur between Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, who have certain rights under their Lease outside the leased area. Such a clause might run somewhat on the following lines”- 'The rights conferred by this agreement are in all respects subject to the rights of the Bahrein Petroleum Company under their lease dated the 29th December, 1934, and shall be so exercised as not to damage, impede or interfere with the property operations and interests of the said Company under their said lease'. This matter will, of course, have to be dealt with during the negotiations in Bahrein. 4. On a minor point, it is perhaps a question whetherruD l 3. the expression 'cognate substances' could be replaced by something more specific in Article 3 of the draft concession. The corresponding expression in the Qatar Concession seems to be 'everything which is extracted therefrom'. 5. We are informing the Political Resident of the points mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this letter. Yours sincerely, (S4.) J. 0. WALTON✓y ,2.1834/36.

I said that I did not think so, but asked what he ^ro^osed to do. I told him that I had informed the fchaikh on the 17th M &amp;rch 1936 of the proposed negotiations of Petroleum concessions -»imited. 3* Major holmes brought up the question of the proposed reservation of the rights of The Bahrain petroleum Company limited and asked whether they had an exclusive right to tne harbour at Sitrah. I said that I should like to examine the actual wording of the agreement, but that I did not think that it was an exclusive right* I emphasised that I could not say for certain without seeing the papers again* He asked this as there seemed to have been some uncertainty in London* (Actually the Bahrain Petroleum Company have the right, but not the exclusive right, to construct inter alia ports, but exactly how much of Sitr&amp;h Island is still available is not clear). 4* I mentioned the question of ^ir 1 in connection with the proposed request for transport facilities (Article 13(a) of draft Concession). The Company apparently lay considerable stress on this right in order to enable them to fly down to places on the Irucial Coast* I said that air facilities in Bahrain were covered by a Civil Air Agreement with ^is jeaty*s Government* Major AA oimes said that he understood that tiie n red line agreement” gave the Companies concerned a right which was not enjoyed by the Standard J il ^onrany of California to axi sorts of transport facilities. I asked whether his Hajesty f s Government v/as a party to the f Red ^ine Agreement 1 jor Holme;s said t.;at he thought that they were) anu said that I did not think that a (as far as I knew) commercial agreement betv/een two oil companies could affect an agreement between a Shaikh and His Majesty 1 s Government. In the course of theconversation I mentioned that permission to land their aeroplane at Bahrain had been refused by the Bahrain u overnment to the California Arabian Standard ^il Company* 5. After some discussion “h*. Arnold and %:.jar Holmes decided that they would try to go to see the Resident at Busnire and as^ed me to send tne telegram below, which should be issued en clair to the Resident at Karachi. 6 # Home conversation passed on the subject of the -‘•ruciai - Coast and I asked whether ^r. Iikington f s letter dated the 17tn March 1336 had actually been issued to the u haikhs concerned. for distribution by the air mail after it was written. I said isbi that I knew that the ncsiaent’s idea had been/to communicate to the Shaikhs the approval of His Majesty’s doveriiment to the options and to get their guarantee for the protection of working -rties and for the payment of condensation in the event of 1 jl trouble, and that I knew that the Resident had approached them on his recent tour. Mr. Arnold reverted to this later, and asked whether any harm had been done by sending the ieater (which had been done on the orders of their Company at ^ome&gt;. I said that it was possible tnat harm might not ensue but that with people like the Xruciai Shaikhs it was necessary to present one idea at a time- to them and that if they received the ^ompany^ letter before they had made up their minds about giving the undertaking regarding protection they might well start making difficulties. I said in the course of the conversation that I was anxious that they snouid discuss the matter of the i’rucial u oast with the Resident. like to speak to the Shaikh of B a hrain about the agreement in general terms and also that he would inform Mr. Skinner of his object so as not to leave him in the dark.

X. 0. si ton Require, CB.,WC«, The India Office, london. i sent under d.o.P.l..Ho.259-S of Q/4/Z6- lajor Holmes rather to my surprise said that though he had informed Mr. Skinner informally of the P.C.L^s proposal to obtain a concession from the Shaikh vrith regard to the rcddining area of Bahrair. not covered by the Balirsin Petroleum Company’s concession, Mr. Skinner aid not appear in any way perturbed,nor did he (Major E.) think that the B.P.C. proposed to compete with the P.C.L. in the matter of the remaining area. However, he till be able to confirm this attitude when he returns to Bahrain. g, hr Jcr Ho3ics ss id that hr*. Skinner had informed him thet they - the B.P.C* - were ’’fitting pretty” with His Majesty 1 s Government i.e. were on good terms with them. That the B.P.C, Tuch appreciated the S 3 r mpathetic attitude and assistance which Fis Majesty’s Government had extended towards them end were out to reciprocate in every way possible. 3. The ouestiorjof the rights of the B.P.C. outside tneir 1 actual oil area in the matter of fresh water, telephones, &lt;E pipe-lines, Sitra harbour, roads, etc. was then discussed. To cover these rights a Clause 22 (a) had, at the suggestion of the India Office (see India Office telegram No.987 of 18th March 1956) been inserted in the proposed Leased Area by Major H. I suggested that Major H. might go into the various points concerned with Mr. Skinner and to report accordingly to his Company or this might be deferred until tne r.C.L. had actually got their concessions it was presumably for the Company to decide. 4. The question of flying facilities for the P.C.L. was then discussed. M&amp;jorR.’s general idea seemed to be that the P.C.L. /u 6 p # C.L, might establish e sort of centre in Bahrain in touch by air with the other areas, chiefly the Traeial Coast* I pointed out that the Rulers of Kuweit, Bahrain and Muscat bad forbidden private flyers to fly over or land in their territories* The idea of this was to prevent single- engined machines flying down the Arab Coast which is un suitable for such machines, and it might be possible to obtain permission for comrerciai planes uf the P.C.L* to fly over these areas. (There is no mention of flying rights in the f.P.C. concession, and they do not require such right m'rce their rrea of operations is a small one, while P.C*L*, if they obtain nil the concessions they wart, v;il3 cover the whole of the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf). 5 . On the assumption that the P*C*L* would obtain their concession X raised the question as to whether their drill ing operations would interfere with those ol the B*F•l.s whether their wells might not tap the latter’s supply* Such a state of affair had, I understood, occurred in some Oil-field where two rival Companies were operating sice by side. Major H. said that to meet such an eventuality he had inserted a new paragraph instead of tne present one under Article £2 of the proposed Leased Area concession which he had shown informally to Mr* Skinner who had agreed. The last words of that it was satisfactory, /this paragraph read us follows! n Further THE CQMPAHY agrees that drilling, producing and plugging operations will conform with good oil field practice snd will at all times fully protect horizons from which The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited are producing, such protection to be to the complete satisfaction of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. n For 'His Britannic Majesty’s Government^ at the end of the paragraph Colonel Loch, so Major H* informed me, had suggested /suggested that ’’the Shaikh' should he substituted. (The Shaikh is obviously the interested party but he will ol course look to Els Majesty's Government for advice on such a technical matter, and I suggest that the words 'oi the Shaikh acting on the advice of His Majesty's Government' should be substituted for 'of His Eritannlckajasty's Government') .

BRITISH LE3ATIOH, JSD3U. 12th February 1936, tty dear George, I have rend with ^re^t interest the enclosures in Foreign Office printed despatches Ho.21 (2 7262/452/91) of January l?th end Ho.24 (2 362/260/91) of January 23rd about the projects cf the new company Petrolsum Concessions Ltd. in connexion tfich the oil potentialities of various Persian Gulf areas. 1 should like to aek three questions, only the first of which concerns me directly but all of which have some bearing on matters within icy province*- (1) In paragraph 9 of Dalton’s letter to you of November 4th, he suggests a doubt as to whether the Kuwait Neutral Zone is within the H Red Line* Agreement. 1 have never seen this Agreement but have been under the impression that the only areas in which it left the A.I.O.C. free to act independently of the I.P.C. were Kuwait t arritory proper and the Farsan T slands. 3s this wrong or doubtful ? (2) The Bahrain intelligence Report for November 1st to 15th describes the options for Sharjah, ‘'‘ibai and Ras-al-Khaimah as having been obtained by the B*Arcy Exploration Company Ltd. Is this an emanation of the I.P.C. or the JL.I.O.C., the letter of which ia stated in Mr. Skliros* letter cf October 24th to Walton to have got the options ? i3) What/ 0,W # Rendel, L’sq., C.M.G., Foreign Office.(3) Wh*t is our position in regard to oil concessions in Muscat ? Have we a treaty rigJit to control tiie granting fo them by the Sultan or merely a practieal hold on him ? AThile 1 recognise the inevitability of the recent developments connected with oil in the Gulf Sheykhdoms, I rather regret that they have coincided with tne active leacuaaion of the question of I bn Baud's frontiers, I am afraid that they cvill be used to auppox*t the theory that our mein object in that discussion is to do Ibn Baud down in order to .jet economic advantages in Arabia. This thesis is being boomed by Philby. He develops it in an article in the ^gyptain Gazette of January 14th, ?/hich you have doubtless seen or can in the Office, he supplements it in conversation and T.ay presently do so in print by suggesting th t Grtat Britain is doing in Arabia ./hat ; taly is doing in Abysnigfi^ but more cleverly. In one conversation with me he coupled my name with that of l&gt;enito Mussolini but when I begged him to substitute 'His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom* for nine he assented. 1 am sending copies oi this letter to Bushire, B&amp;hr&amp;in an; Kuwait. Yours ever, Sd. AFftREW RYAN,1141/260/91 P.Z.1993/36 3 W, 1 March, 1936. Sir Andre« Ryan. JKDDA. dear Andrev/, Your letter Ho.309/81/5 cf the 12th February on oil development question in the Uulf. I take your three q ueet ions seratim (i) The Iraq Petroleum Company (or, as it ^as then known, the Turkish Petroleum CoDipaiv) Croup Agreoment of 1923 « known as the 'Red H Line Agreement” - as ^ ou know drew a red line rouna arabia and Asia Minor but left out Koweit and the Persan Islands. Ri-ihrain was included within tneorea. In regard to Xoweit in piorticular the definitions appended to the map winch accompanied the agreement state that the red line is intended to follow Hhe limit of “the territorial waters of the Arabian •‘Peninsula excepting the Sultanate of iloweit ‘'and the Ferean Islands Archipelago”. As the Neutral Zone had already been conaitutsd when this agreement mas entered into, it was assumed by the Iraq Petr-leum Company - an assumption that hae not be n disputed - tlut the Hautral ^one is not, in ho faras the Red Line Agreement ia concerned, part of the ’’Sultanate “of Lwweit'*, and therefore lies within the arse covered by that Agreement. This is the accepted view.(ii) The X/arey 'Exploration Company Limited is a aubisdiary ccm^any of the Anglo- I rani an Oil Company. It has &amp; bus? 11 nominal capital, fully owed bv the latter company* I understand that the subiediary company ueuwlly does all the preliminary negotiations ee regards options and concessions, but any subsequent exploration is entrused to the parent company - i.e. the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which in turn under the Hed Line Agreeraent must offer to the Iraq Petroleum Company any concessions it may acquire within the red line area. (iii) tfith regard to oil in Muscat, the Sultan undertook by sn agreement with us of February 1923 not to exploit any oil which might be found in his territories or to grant permis ion for its exploitation without prior consultation with the ^Ojiticsl Agent and the approval of the Government of India. 2. As to Philby^ articles in the Sgyptain Gazette of the 14th January; there does not seem much harm in it though there is a alight sting in its tail. In actual fact it is only in connection with the qatar frontier that Philby might, if he wanted to, charge us with any ulterior motives in the matter of frontier delimitation. fxi.e only other territories march ing with iiaudi Arabia are Abu Dhabi and Muscat, and there se^tms no grout prospect of oil being looked for at any distance from the coastal belt.Confidential * No. C/181-10/12* Political Agency &gt;/ Baiirain, the 19th April 1956. From L To The Honourable the Political Resit in the Persian Bushire Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, C Political Agent, Bahrain, Petroleum Concessions Limited Sir I have the honour to enclose a copy of a revised draft concession which was handed to me by Major F. Holmes on the 16th April la36 with the request that 1 would send it to you as a substitute for that handed to you by him in Bushire. 2 . I have not had time fully to compare this revised draft with that sent by the India Office (see paragraph 2 of Mr. Walton*s letter Wo. P.Z.946/1936 dated the 7th February 1936 to you), but an hasty comparison shows certain differences which have been marked for your con venience in pencil on Major Holmes* revised draft. 3.

A copy has been sent to VV' -c»( -C T fl bj ^L Mail - Foreign. Sficretary, Oovernment of inflb* The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.© Mr. Ballantyne called this morning. He said that he was probably going to San Francisco this week and was anxious to talk about the present position in regard to the unallotted area, as this was a matter which no doubt his Principals would want to discuss with him. He said he had had a communication irom Mr. Skinner, the chief local representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Political Agent enquiring, at the request of the Sheikh, whether the * B.P.C. wished to make a counter offer to that of Petroleum Concessions Limited for the unallotted area. I gathered that Mr. Skinner also reported that Major Holmes had had a talk with him and had endeavoured to explain how it was that he was now working for a company other than the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein. Mr. Ballantyne said he was sure that the B.P.C. would not want to do anything embarrassing to H.M.G. and he did not know at all what their reaction would be to the Sheikh's communication^and to the position as a whole. It seemed very questionable whether there was oil in any commercial quantities in the unallotted area and in these circumstances it was difficult to say what good reason there could be for P.C.L. to interest themselves in it. ■r ^ _ nr „ The idea which was floating in his (Mr. Ballantyne 1 s) mind was that possibly some kind of arrangement might be made whereby B.P.C. and P.C.L. might jointly make an exploration of the area in order to determine whether or not there is, in fact, oil in any commercial quantities there/ Confidential. } sf n 7 i v.. y / 19 SB Bahrein Oil - Question of Unallotted Area.2 . there. This, however, was merely a personal idea of his own and he had no idea what his Company’s views might he. What, however, he thought would he the best practical step to take in the first instance would he to reply to the political Agent that the Company would like a little time to think over the Sheikh’s communication. It seemed to him that it was undesirable to do anything in a hurry. I told Mr. Ballantyne that H.lvI.G.’s position in the matter was quite simple. P.C.L. had come to them with a request for permission to approach the Sheikh with a view to a concession for the unallotted area. H.M.G. had told P.C.L. that they had no objection to them approaching the Sheikh, subject to the usual conditions, i.e, that no concession could be concluded without H.M.G.’s permission and that political safeguards would have to be provided. H.M.G. (this for Mr. Ballantyne’s personal information) did not think it desirable or proper to ’’start an auction” by informing the B.P.C. that P.C.L. were applying to the Sheikh, but it was present to their minds that the Sheikh would almost certainly ask B.P.C. for a counter offer. This was apparently what had happened (though we had not yet received any official report from Bahrein). If the B.P.C. decided to accept the sheikh’s suggestion and put in a counter offer, H.M.G. would undoubtedly agree to the company doing so through their local representative or some other representative in Bahrein, the first approach being made through the Political Agent, who would, of course, have to be kept informed of the progress of the negotiations. H.M.G.’s view, expressed in 1933, was that, in regard to the unallotted/unallotted area, the field is open, H.M.G. ■being- concerned only with insisting on the necessary political safeguards and giving such advice to the Sheikh to guard his interests as they might be able to. In the course of conversation Mr. Ballantyne mentioned that he understood from Mr. Skinner that any concession which might be given to P.C.L. would certainly safeguard the existing rights of B.P.C. I confirmed that' this was the case and that H.M.G. would certainly, in any such contingency, give the Sheikh the best advice they could in order to ensure that m any conflict of rights under the two concessions the precedent rights of the B.P.C. should predominate. As regards Mr. Ballantyne’s idea of sending a temporising reply to the Sheikh’s enquiry, 1 said that this was, of course, a matter for the Company to decide. i ii.ih.WH*'***&gt;** -&lt;• '• **- ,r ‘ H.M.G. were naturally anxious to see such negotiations settled and done with as soon as possible, but so far as I knew there was no very immediate urgency; however that was not for us to say, but for the Bahrein Government.

TX-O' tfni.s *z: ll/rfbO' Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No* C/180 dated the 28th April 1936 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government regarding the claim of Bahrain to the island of Hawar. 2. I have never landed at Hawar Island, but I have flown over it. It is a low, desolate looking place near to the mainland of Qatar, but it is possible that it may have considerable value now that oil has been found in Bahrain and is hoped for in Qatar. 3. At the interview mentioned in the second paragraph of the Adviser f s letter, I contented nyself with saying that I knew that there had been corres pondence about Zubarah and would look up whether Hawar Island was mentioned. I have not as yet been able to trace certain records, of which I am aware, about Zubarah and Zaknuniyah Island, but ny recollection is that the late Shaikh Sir *Isa bin tAli A1 Khalifah was informed that the Bahrain claim to these places could not/not be recognised and that a similar reply was given c, — ^ to a representation by Shaikh Sir f Isa»s son. Shaikh Abdullah, which he made personally in Delhi and ,, , — _ yi/£*- a^ {/v-n C-l’T L £i&gt; possibly London, t % ' ' 4* I do not recollect that Hawar Island was mentioned in the course of those proceedings, probably not as I do not think that the Turks made any attempt i / i 1 to raise their fla g on it. Mention is, however, made ^ of Hawar Island in the seventh paragraph of Major / (later Colonel) F.B. Prideaux* letter No. 207 dated the 4th April 1909. 5. Subject to any past correspondence, which is not available to me, I am inclined to think that there is real substance in Shaikh Sir Hamad bin »Isa*s claim and also that it might in certain circumstances suit us politically to have as large an area as possible t j t ^ 32-4 MU j ^ I *&gt;, HAwftk (n(&gt; ^ included under Bahrain. 6 . I do not know what Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Jasim of Qatar f s views about the Island are, but I have never heard of any protest from him against the activities of Bahrain subjects there. 7. On a recent occasion I took an opportunity of mentioning to Major F. Holmes that if any claim to Zubarah or places like that were to be made by the Shaj^ of Bahrain, it would be well if he (Major Holmes) were to consult me before doing anything.

Dated, Safar b, 1355 April 38,1^36. Jfrom The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, In connection with the preaent negotiations for an oil concession over the territory of Bahrain which is not included in the 1925 oil concession I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al-Klialifah, K.C.I.n., C.S.I., has instructed me to state to you that the Hawar group of islands lying between the southern extremity of Bahrain island and the coast of ^attar is indisputably part of the State of Bahrain. 2. His Excellency, mentioned this fact to His A Britannic Majesty’s Political Agents in Bahrain and he wishes to remind you that he informed you that Hawar belonged to Bahrain vixen accompanied by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al-Kbalifah and myself he called on you on 18th April 1936 to discuss the question of a new oil concession. As he regards his sovereignty over the Hawar islands which includes one of the largest —largest islands belonging to Bahrain as a matter of very great importance he considers that the fact should be stated officially in writing. 3. The Kawar group of islands include the following named islands as well as a number of small islets. 1. Noon 2. Meshtaan 3. Al-Mat err ad*' 4. Rubadh 5. Kawar 6. Grinan 7. Mahazwarah^'' 4. At least four of the larger islands are permanently occupied by His Excellency’s subjects who live there in stone houses as f * &gt;#&gt;to ^ar&lt; TTrn w&gt;o i ir r well as barastis and who are the ovaiers of valuable fishtraps round the coasts of the islands which they acquired by purchase or gift under the seal of the late Shaikh of Bahrain, Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali al-Khalifah, and also His Excellency Shaikh Hamad. 5. The inhabitants of the Hawar islands and their forefathers are and always have been the subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain in whose territory they are living. 6. The people of liawar are today and always have been under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain. They appear in the Bahrain Courts in answer to summonses which are served on them in Hawar and all their cases and disputes are dealt with in the Bahrain Courts. Recently inin connection with a quarrel between some of the people in Hawar, the Bahrain police had occasion to make several arrests in Hawar and to produce the persons in the Bahrain Court* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.Confidential &gt; No. C/224-10/12. ^ ' ]; f ^ political Agency. b Bahrain, the 3th May 1936.

Petrole um Concessions Limite d. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Colonel Loch*s letter No^ C/217-10/12 dated the 6th May 1336. Ma!or F. Holmes came and saw me this morning and the following is a repofct of the conversation. Prior to the interesting part of the conversation Malor Holmes asked if his remarks would be passed on to the Bahrain Government and I said that only if the Political Resident considered it desirable. He also stated that he was diffident in bringing forward this particular question. 2. You will see from the enclosures to this letter that the Bahrain Government have asked that Article 1 of the Concession Agreement shall specify the islands belonging to the Bahrain group and Major Holmes has replied by asking them to name them. The point is that the ownership of the Hawar. is of great importance because it is directly in what Major Holmes called the oil 'line*. 3. Major Holmes stated that if the Bahrain Government claimed Hawar then the Qatar concessionaires would probably maintain that it was included under the Qatar Concession and protest against the Shaikh of j UA&gt;c ' Bahrainis/ uvt ^7 r &gt; Bahrain t s claim, A claim to the Island* by the Shaikh would probably bring The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited into the field in competition with Petroleum Concessions Limited for the concession at present being negotiated here by him. He also said that if Petroleum Concessions Limited obtained the present concession then the Question of ownership of the Island in question would not be brought up by them. 4. I gathered that he was suggesting that if Petroleum Concessions Limited obtained the concession they are negotiating here a possibly difficult question of territorial rights would be avoided. In ny opinion the question must arise at some period and if it is not brought up now it will come up if and when production commences and Royalties are assessed. 5. Major Holmes further stated that he had seen Mr. S.K. Longriee in Cairo during his recent trip, he returned here on Wednesday, and the question of Hawar was discussed and Mr. Lonpri** told him that the question was being discussed with Mr. Walton. Major Holmes said he heard from Shaikh ’Abdullah bin ’Isa through Mohammed Yateem that the Shaikh claimed the island. I did not tell him thatjlthe Bahrain Government had raised the point. 6 . I am asking the Bahrain Government not to send the precise definition of Bahrain islands to Major Holmes until I have heard from you. 7. Major Holmes also said that while in Cairo he had written to Bin Sa’ud and seen Fuad Hamza but possibly his interview with Mb. Longrigg was of importance both as regards Bahrain and Kuwait. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.COPY. 7 Bahrain, May 7th 1936 • To His Excellency JL-I-/V V* •• l- W1» v» J y Shaikh Sir ^amad bin Issa Al-KhaH^Vi Ruler of Bahrain. Your Excellency, X 1 Greetings. I have to thank Your Excellency for your letter dated April 30th 1936 in which Your Excellency gives details of alterations you desire made in several of the Articles of the Draft Agreement for an Oil Concession dealing with the outside Area of the State of Bahrain and being those Areas not included in the Concession Area now held by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. order as Your Excellency has done in your letter. Article 1. This calls for little comment. If Your Excellency would kindly give instructions that an Official List and precise description of the Islands - belonging to the State of Bahrain - be supplied to me by the Bahrain Government Office, I shall be pleased to insert them in full in the Draft Agreement. I have no other means of obtaining a list of and the names of the Islands, or I should not trouble Your Excellency. Article 2 . The years are calendar years. Article dliCa) . I note Your Excellency's remarks under this heading and shall pass them on to the London Office of Petroleum Concessions Limited ( for Irhom I am acting) for consideration. I would remark however that Your Excellency conveys the impression - by demanding the same rate of Royalty as that paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company I will deal with the points raised in the same Limited/Limited - that the conditions of operating and working other oil deposits (if any) in the State of Bahrain will \ be much the same as at present. Operation and pro duction charges carried out in Territorial Water Areas and on scattered Islands are likely to prove much more costly.than those pertaining under the ideal conditions of the Bahrain Petroleum Compands Limited Area. So consideration is usually given to difficult and costly working conditions by way of a lesser Royalty, especially when a much smaller Area is concerned as is the case in the present instance. However as stated above, I shall refer both the questions raised under this heading by Your Excellency, to the London Office of ny Company. A rticle 15(a ). I appreciate that Your Excellency desires to preserve the amenities of the towns of Manamah and Moharraq by means of open areas. Would it be asking too much to request Your Excellency to give instructions to the Bahrain Goverment Offices to give me precise particulars as to the limits of the open areas that Your Excellency wishes to preserve against encroachment by the Company. Further a copy of the Aircraft Regulations of the State of Bahrain - if pro curable from the Bahrain Government Office - would be of great help to my Company. Article i5(c). I should be pleased if Your Excellency would instruct the Bahrain Government Offices to give details of how Your Excellency requires this Article 13(c) altered as it appears to me - in its x&gt;resent form- to cover the point raised in Your Excellency*s letter. Article 16(b) . I note the emendation desired in this Article of the Draft Agreement. Ar ticle 23^ Thereis no question of transferring the Agreement to a third patty. Petroleum Concessions Limited intend to form a Company to take care of each Concession obtained, the Company so formed would be■D be financed from within Petroleum Concessions Limited* The Company in this instance would be called Petroleum Concession (Bahrain) Limited, controlled and operated by Petroleum Concessions Limited. However I will bring the question before the London Office of Petroleum Con cessions Limited, and if I received from the Bahrain Government Offices the exact wording and form that Your Excellency desires this Article to have, I will forward that also to the London Office. I anticipate no difficulty in adjusting the point raised to the satisfaction of Your Excellency. 2 * In respect of the addition of the matter of drilling obligations, I offer no opinion but would bring to the notice of Your Excellency as it is most probable that drilling may have to be undertaken on areas subject to tidal influence, it becomes difficult to lay down drilling obligations in such circumstances. I shall forward the suggestion to Petroleum Concessions Limited for their views. 3 . I note ^our Excellency*s decision that you do not propose to discuss the remaining financial matters which are in this Agreement before the matters raised in Your Excellency*s letter have been agreed. I foresee that there will be considerable delay before the above and remaining financial matters have been settled as between Your Excellency*s Govern ment and my Company, therefore - with Your Excellency’s permission - I propose returning to Kuwait for some weeks, but hope to be available - at any time agreeable to Your Excellency - shortly after I receive instructions - on the questions raised in Your Excellency’s letter - from my London Office. I remain. Sir, Your obedient servant.By Air Mail. INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, S' BUSH! RE RESIDENCY~l T5F” No Date.

He has commenced by claiming that the island of Hawar is part of his dominions# This island is, fact, situated off the west coast of Qatar, from whi'ch it seems to be not more than 3/4 miles distant at its nearest point. The island is shown on the official map of Qatar which was signed by the Shaikh of Qatar and by Mr. Mylles and which forms part of -the Qatar Concession.

''It is said to be ^ sometimes visited in the winter and to have had in the past some degree of connection with Bahrain subjects, if not, (as the Shaikh of Bahrain now claims) with the Khalifa family itself.

I find, however, that we have no knowledge of the terms of the Lease (to the Bahrein Petroleum Company) dated December 29th, 1934? and this suggests the reflection that there may 'be various other leases or modifications of the original Concession given on December 2nd, 1925&gt; to the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, and that these, or some of them, may he such as to concern an intending Concessionaire of the remaining portions of that group of islands.

The map in question showed not only Qatar, but part of the neighbour ing territory including the Islands of Bahrain, so that the fact of Hawar appearing on it is of course no proof of ownership one way or the other. 3.

Subject * Petroleum Concessions Limited - Claim of Bahrain to the Island of Hawar* 2. It is convenient to deal first with the statement in the- 2 - letter No.C/217 dated the 6th May 1936 to the representations made by Shaikh Abdullah In London in 1919. Though the question of the ownership of the Island of Hawar was not specifically mentioned then by Shaikh Abdullah, in view of its close proximity to Zubara it is useful to examine the connection of the Al Khalifah family of Bahrain with the latter place. 1 j» . A 4. A note on the History of Zubara and the claims of the Jr Shaikh of Bahrain thereto is attached to letter No,5650 dated the 31st January 1920&gt; from the Acting Civil Coininissioner in Mesopotamia to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. It will be seen from this letter that the Al Khalifah family first settled in Zubara in 1766, that it was thence that they captured Bahrain in 1782, that subsequently a member of the family (who was expelled from Bahrain) rebuilt the town of Zubara in 1842, and that it was not until about 1850 that the Al Than! (the present ruling family of Qatar) rose to power in Zubara. j') L ^ 5. The representations of Shaikh Abdullah were replied to by the Government of India in their letter No.D.O. 1145-E.A. dated the 5th May 1920. As regards Zubara the reply stated that the Government of India did not see their way to 'permit and assist' the Shaikh of Bahrain to open a port at Zubara. From tne use of the word 'permit' I infer that this refusal was tantamount to a denial of the Shaikh of Bat -n ! s c^aira to Zubara. If therefore Hawar, from its proximit; to t u mainland of Qatar (it is described at page 1513 of Volume II of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf as lying 5 miles due west of the point of Has Aburuk) is held to follow the owner ship of the mainland. It woulci fall under vatar.6* On the other hand, the Government of India decision (if it may be taken as such) referred to in my paragraph 5 above did not specifically refer to Hawar, it is beyond doubt that the Island has long been occupied ,by the Dowasir tribe of Bahrain (vide y** v y' &lt;■(&amp;*' b &gt;jlc A } paragraph 7 of letter No,207 dated the 4th April 1909 from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Political Resident, ^opy forward ed to the Government of India under the latter’s letter No.1043 dated the 2nd May 1909, and the reference to the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf quoted in my paragraph 5 above), and it appears beyond doubt that the present Shaikh of Bahrain’s father (who succeeded in 1869) and the Shaikh himself have exercised active jurisdiction in Hawar down to the present day, (vide paragraphs J r £1 ✓ / &gt;, 4-6 of letter No.C/180 dated the 28th April 1936 from the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain), apparently without interference or protest by the Shaikh of Qatar. 7. In all the circumstances of the case, I incline to the view that Hawar should be regarded as belonging to the Shaikh of Bahrain and that the burden of disproving his claim lies on the Shaikh of Qatar. We have heard nothing on the subject from the Shaikh of Qatar, and it is quite possible that he may not dispute the claim of the Shaikh of Bahrain. 8. The decision as to the ownership of Hawar may, according to Major Holmes (vide paragraph 3 of Captain Hickinbotham 1 s letter No.C/224 date&amp; the 9th May 1936), affect the future activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company as, if it is awarded to Bahrain, that Company may think it worth while to compete with Petroleum Concessions Limited for the remaining area. sd.

The question of the Sheikh of Bahrein’s claim to this island has, I understand, been raised locally by Major Holmes and submitted for the Resident’s consideration. We shall not fail to let you know as soon as we receive a report from him on the subject and are in a position to give a final ruling, I doubt whether the map attached to the Qatar Concession is relevant in this connection - its object was to define the southern boundary of the Concession, Incidentally it marks the Bahrein Islands as well as Hawar, ,1 ^4 V Yours sincerely, a (iytY ( ■ipos, Esq., jkum Concessions Ltd., Hate House, knsbury Square, E.C.2.NOTE ON 'HAWAR' ISLAND. This land is situated off the West Coast of Qatar apparently 3 to 4 miles from the Mainland, at its nearest point. it is shown on the map of Qatar which was signed by the Shaikh of Qatar and by Mr. Mylles and which forms part of Qatar Concession. This map is believed to have been seen and approved by the Hon ! ble the Political Resident (and ? by the India Office). The Island is about 10 miles long, and some 2 miles wide at widest point and is believed to be an inhabited. This Island is not mentioned in the Encyclopedia of Jslam which gives- the list of the Islands forming the Bahrain Group (it is not also mentioned under Qatar). In th e Handbook of Arabia (published by Admiralt Staff 1915 - a ^ecrel?* document of considerable value) the Island is mentioned in the description of lijfatar, in the following words:- 'an txxi island, Jazirah Hawar, lies 5 miles West of Ras Aburuk on the West Coast, with which it is roughly parallel; it is about 10 miles long and has no permanent population, but the Dowasir of Zallaq in Bahrain have houses used as shooting boxes in winter and a cistern for rain water. The Shaikh of Bahrain seems to have claimed sovereignty over Qatar till 1868 but after that (by agreement with the British Government) received i tribute only.

If you have any farther communications of a secret or confid ential nature for the Shaikh I suggest you address me at Karachi (care of Colonel D.S.

Yours sincerely, (Signed) T. HICKIKBOTHAM C. Dalrymple Belgrave Esquire C.3.E., 24 Lewes Crescent, Brighton.24 Lewes Crescent* 22nd August 193 6* Brighton* Dear Howes, I am writing direct to you as I have a communication of some importance which I wish to make to the Shaikh and I think it advisable that it should be made through you not through my own office* Perhaps you could write to him and tell him what I have to say and when he replies I should be very much obliged if you would send me a wire, to this address, letting me know what he wishes me to do. This is the position; when he was in London he decided to begin conversations with the representatives of the Bahrain Petroleum Coy and the Petroleum Concessions regarding a concession over the area of Bahrain, including the Hawar group of islands, which is not within the existing concession. Having met the two representatives he left me to carry on conversations with them, I had several long talks with both of them and finally both companies made definite offers which are described in the two letters, of which I enclose copies. The whole business was started very late in his visit, unfortunately and nothing definite was decided. I should add that these conversations took place with the knowledge and approval of the India Office to mhom I communicated the results of the conversations. Very shortly before the Shaikh, and I, left England for Paris I wrote to the India Office, after they had previously approved of my suggestion that I should do so, enclosing copies of the two letters and asking them to obtain the advice of the Petroleum Department as to which of the offer£ appeared to be the best one. The reply from the 1.0. only arrived today. The Shaikh while in London suggested that after I returned to England I should continue conversations with the two companies, later, in Istanbul, he suggested that we might / divide the additional area offering the Hawar Islands to the / Petroleum2 Petroleum Concessions and the rest of Bahrain proper, including a small islet off Muharraq as well as the shores to the Bapeo. I wrote to the I*0# asking whether they approved of my continuing to negotiate on behalf of the Shaikh, to this too I only received a reply today. I shall be up in London early in September, going up for the day from Brighton fairly often and before I go to the India Office to discuss oil matters I want to know definitely what the Shaikh wishes me to do and to say. Colonel Fowle will be in London too and I shall be seeing him so of course I shall be able to consult him but I feel in a somewhat difficult position 1 know what the Shaikh wishes me to do and how far I am to go with the Companies. I of course would do nothing without the knowledge and approval of the 1.0. The points on which I want a reply are:- 1. Shall I, provided the 1*0. approve, try to negociate with the two companies according to the Shaikh f s idea for the Hawar islands separately with the Petroleum Concessions and with the Bapeo for the remaining Bahrain area? Should he wish this I would either cable or write the particulars of their offers, if they are interested; I personally very much doubt that either Company would care to take a portion only, although Clauson in a letter to me today says he thinks this would be a good idea. 2. Have I the Shaikh^ authority to continue to negociate with the two companies on the present lines, not splitting the area, and to endeavour to get a better offer, guided of course by Colonel Fowle and the India Office? As you will see from the enclosed letters the 1.0. approve of my continuing negotiations but I am most anxious to be quite sure that the Shaikh approves too, after all he is the person who is most importantly concerned. I am asking you to deal with the matter by communicating these facts to the Shaikh and obtaining a reply from him as it is difficult / for me3 for me to write a letter to him, I enclose a copy of the ' advice ' on the two offers, will you tell the Shaikh from me that my impression is that on the whole the Petroleum Concessions offer appears likely to he the most advantageous assuming that i oil is found. This is my own personal opinion. I must apologise for inflicting on you a somewhat difficult joh hut as I am sure you will appreciate it is difficult for me to know exactly what action to take without hearing from the Shaikh and until I do hear I do not want to begin talks with the 1.0. or the oil Companies.

C.D.BPetroleum Department, 14th August 1936. ( Mines Department ) Dean Stanley Street, Millhank P.Z. 5897/3 6. LONDON. S.W. 1. My dear Walton, With reference to your letter of July 30th concerning the offers which the Shaikh of Bahrain has received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited I have looked into this question from the point of view of which of the two offers is likely to he financially the most advantageous in the long run. The whole question is largely a gamble, dependent on whether the oil indications are favourable or nett. Considering the offers made by the two Companies separately; (1) Under the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s proposal the Company want the right to examine the territory for three months before committing themselves, but if having paid a purely nominal sum in order to secure an opportunity of carrying out preliminary investigations they decide to turn down the proposition, the ’Iraq Petroleum Company may lose interest and the Shaikh would thus get nothing at all. If the Company decide to proceed and take up a lease they pay down a lump sum of 95.400,000, but the territory would then be merged with their existing area and the only payments which the Shaikh would receive would be in respect of royalty on any oil produced. It might, in fact, turn out that they would decide to hold the additional territory in reserve and not develop it to any appreciable extent for a considerable time. (2) Under the Petroleum Concessions Limited proposal the Company offers to pay 95.50,000 on signature of the Agreement and they must also pay 9s. 56,000 during the / option- 2 - option period of six years. If they terminate the agreement within this period they still have to pay any balance outstanding of the full amount specified. ( See Article 4 and 5 of the draft Agreemait ) They might of course abandon the concession at the end of the option period after making a total payment of only 9 s .206,000. On the other hand, if oil were found and the Company decided to take out a lease they would have to continue with further minimum annual payments of 9 s .50,000 p.a. for the first 5 years of the lease and 9 s . 100,000 p.a. subsequently. There would, therefore, be some inducement to them to continue with the development of the area and the Shaikh would be assured of the receipt of regular minimum annual payments, which, after a period of tfen years would overtake the original lump sum offered by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. If the Company found oil and developed it the royalty payments might well exceed the minimum annual payments. Yours sincerely, (sd) P.C.

LONDON, E.C.2 11th September 1936. My dear Clauson, At our meeting in your office a few days ago, when Colonel Favle was present, you suggested that I should send you a summary of our proceedings, actual and intended, in the legion which concerns the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You are, 1 think, already fully informed on the subject but perhaps, as you suggested, your information is contained in scattered reports which it would be convenient to summarise. I will therefore do this . In the Neutral zone, immediately South of the Kuwait Principality, we hoped, early in the present year, to obtain a Concession lor the Sheikh oi Kuwait’s half-rights over the territory* for which purpose we drafted a concession and sent you a copy. Dater. however, when our negotiator, Major Holmes, was actually in the field, we were led by the advice of the Foreign Office to renounce the idea of a Concession, in view of the delicate inter-state position of the Neutral Zone, and to ask merely for an Option on the Sheikh’s rights. This, in May, it seemed certain that we could obtain. At the last moment, however, the Shaikh refused to sign (tempering his r efusal with many friendly expressions) and said he would prefer to leave the question temporarily in abeyance. The rca.son, we believe, was that, owing to his increasingly friendly relations with Ibn Saud, the/2. r the Shaikh hoped for the re-mcorporation of the Neutral Zone in his own territories (as was the case previous to the de-limitation of the Zone) and thus for the power to best O’ / ^ not half, but the whole. Both he and ibn Send are convinced that the Neutral Zone is rich in oil. We shall probably return to the charge later in this year, in the hope that the Shaikh will have modified his position. in the Bahrain group of islands, wo intend to obtain a Concession for all the territory (including territorial waters) not already leased to the Bahrain Oil Company. Contact was made with the shaikh by Major Holmes and certain amendments to our Draft Concession - of which you were given a copy - ..ere made by the Shaikh. Nith these we can probably agree. On the financial side we have made what we consider a generous offer, but have not yet the shaikh 1 s reply. 1 am hoping to discuss the revised Draft and offer with Mr. Belgrave within the next few days. The question of ownership of Hawar island was referred by us co you, and you ha.ve replied that it should be considered as Bahrain territory. The Company proposes to make Bahrain the administrative headquarters of its activities, not only ; ’' n ’k-k a 'k Island, but in the whole Persian Gulf area. It is therefore shipping to Manama the necessary equipment for c tie drilling and geological parties proposed, of which details are given below. Mr. M.V,Packer, whose appointment as Company's Manager in that area you have already approved, **■* 1 »''«« »'« » II inam „ has paid a flying visit to the Gulf, and will take up his residence at Manama on October 19th. He will be joined chore a fortnight later by geologists and drillers, whoso work/2i~*. / [W 0 3. ^ r It f y\», cl. work (as will appear below) will be upon the mainland. Mr. Packer will arrange for his house and office accommodation on his arrival, meanwhile occupying Major Holmes’ house. j^We are at the moment taking in hand, through the Bombay Agency of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the recruitment oi certain Indian personnel, which we think will be necessary for our office, our Qatar ’W'liTTT''* drilling programme, and our Trucial Coast geological programme. Y/e have sent you under separate letter particulars of the Indian personnel we propose to import, and are anxious to observe the proper formalities in this connection. In the event of our importing a limited number of rig-coolies from Iraq for work on Qatar, we shall obtain the necessary permits in the same way, but shall, of course, do our own recruiting in Iraq. The Company’s interim Agent, pending Mr. Packer's establishment, is Haji Yusif Kami. 1 The Qatar Concession remains, at the moment of writing, the property of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who obtained it early in 1935, and followed this by signing a Political Agreement with H.M.G. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. has now formed a subsidiary, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., with the object of taking over the Concession from the A.I.O.C. This proposal has, within the last day or two, r ^c^ived India Office consent, and letters to the Shaikh of Qatar, proposing that he agree to the transfer, are b^ing sent by the A.I.O.C. Abadan and, we understand, by -che Political Resident. The text of Abadan’s letter will fi rst have becn ^a ^roved the Resident. P.D. (Qatar) Ltd. expects, on transfer of the Concession, to assume all the /4. the obligations vis-a-vis H.M.G. and the Shaikh, which wore previously incumbent on the A.I.O.C. One of those was the drilling Ox two water-vcj-ls on Qatar, and this wc propose to carry out during the coming Autumn and Winter. Qatar will be visited by two of our geologists, Messrs. T.F.Williams on and D. Glynn Jones, early in November, for the purpose of will be accompaniod, or immediately followed, by Mr.O.S. Dickson, who will be in local charge of the drilling, and by Mr. W.St.G.Hombcrsley, who will supervise the drilling initially and by subsequent visits. The Company will take over the house already hired by the A.I.O.C. at Doha, and will ship from Bahrain the necessary motor vehicles and drilling and other materials. On the Trucial Coast two-year Options were, as you know, obtained by the A.I.O.C. during 1935 irom the Rulers of five out of the six independent Shaikhdoms, Umm-aj.-Qaiwain Op'cions which envisage the granting of a long-term Concession same or an associated company during the period. //*■**$ ^ Copies of Draft Concessions for the purpose were supplied to for the arrangement of Concessions by our negotiator, Major June, found touch with most of the Shaikhs and took up his abode at Sharjah lor three months. He found the Shaikhs largely pre-occupied with the pearl-diving season, but was able to make considerable progress with the Shaikh of Dubai, v/as arranged with Shaikh Maktum, the text of which has been siting the wells in consultation with tho Shaikh. These being the exception. You have, of course, copies of those you early in the present year and your permission obtained The latter accordingly visited the Trucial Coast in whom he rogaras as one of the most influential. a Concession c ommuni cat ed /5. i » communicated to you for your agreement. In the end each of the 27 Articles were initialled by the Shaikh and Major Holmes, but the Concession as a whole has not been signed. We understand that the Shaikh, having heard that he would be asked to enter into a further Agreement with H.M.G. on the subject, was unwilling to sign the Concession until he knew more of the Government obligations it would involve. We hope that all this may be satisfactorily arranged to permit of signature in the present Autumn, when Major Holmes will probably return to the Gulf. Meanwhile the Company hopes Ci ^ t 0 arrange with you the terms of the ;I lolitical Agreement 11 t/jjJ which, we understand, will be necessary in the case of each (F /;&amp; y'.p of the Tmcial Coast Concessions. The only point, we wh believe, upon which difference of opinion between the Company and H.M.G. may occur is in the matter of the latter's requirement for a refinery to be erected on the Arab side of the Gulf, in connection with oil which may some day be discovered. On this matter the Company has recently addressed you in a separate letter. It is to be noted, that only two of the five option giving Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast have yet signed the security clause propounded to them by the political Hesiaent, thus securing H.M.G. ! s ratification of the Options. The Shaikhs of Sharjah, Ajman and Ras-al-Khaimah have not yet signed. We have invited your attention to possible consequences of this failure to sign, and expressed the hope that the political Resident will be able to represent the matter to them in such a light that-they will sign and thus permit ratification of the Options., Without this, we imagine, long term Concessions oould scarcely follow, and our/ £ n6 • our field work mi^ht &gt; in the meanwhile, be hampered. It is our intention to send our geological mission named above to Dubai about the middle of November, alter they have sited the Q,atar water-wells. Based on Dubai, where we have leased a house from the Shaikh, and on subsequent Shaikhdoms, and later we hope those of Sharjah and Jnd and Kuwait two or three days later. He will be in iDngland tomorrow, September ISth, for a short visit of consultation and holiday. and Oman for a Concession similar to those proposed for the Trucial Coast, but owing to his long absence at Dhofar, we have not yet been in touch with him.

This summary will be very useful to us. There is only one point to which 1 feel it is desirable to refer at the moment. You mentioned that the question of the ownership of the Hawar group of islands has been referred to the India Office, who have repiie.d that it should be considered as Bahrain territory. In order that there ^may be no misunderstanding may I refer to Walton’s letter to Sklircs, dated the 14th July, No,p c 2.4582/36. It is important that the Company should clearly understand that His Majesty’s Government’s posit 1, n :.s as stated in the last sentence of that letter, namely, that on the basis of the evidence at present before them it appears to them that Hawar belongs to the Sheikh of Bahrein and the burden of disproving his claim'would lie on any other potential claimant. Perhaps you will be hind enough to drop me a line to confirm that the Company appreciate the limited nature of the decision given by His Majesty’s Government in regard to this group of islands.

Mr. Belgrave said he was not sure: His Excellency might mean merely the Hawar group or he might mean the Hawar group plus bhe small islands in the immediate vicinity of the two main Bdi rein Islands. It was agreed that in view of the obscurity regarding the Sheikh's intentions it would not be possible for Mr. Belgrave to carry his negotiations with the oil companies to any conclusion pending his return to Bahrein and discussion with the Sheikh. It was however agreed that it would be useful if Mr. Belgrave were to ascertain informally and without prejudice from Mr. Longrigg whether Petroleum Concessions Limited would be interested in a proposition whereby they would receive, not the whole additional area, but either (a) the Hawar Islands only or (b) the Hawar Islands plus the 'territorial” islands in the immediate vicinity of the two Main Islands and what they would offer for either (a) or (b).

As regards the two main islands, it was agreed that it might be useful for Mr. Belgrave to ascertain (again informally and without prejudice) from Mr. Ballantyne whether the Bahrein Petroleum Company would stand by their offer (of 4 lakhs) if the area to be given to them were to be only unallotted area in the two main islands, or what they would offer either for this area or for this plus the ^territorial” islands. It was pointed out that when they made their offer originally the Bahrein Petroleum Company were unaware of the fact that the Haw r ar Islands were anything to do with Bahrein (though of course their offer was presumably intended to cover the territorial waters and the islands therein). It..was. agreed that it would considerably facilitate Mr. Belgrave J s discussion of the whole question with the Sheikh if he were in possession of information on the above points. The question of the allocation of territorial ) waters was also discussed. Assuming that the Sheikh kept to his idea of splitting the Area in two, and assuming that proposition (b) were adopted, it was suggested that the best thing to do might be to draw lines round the small 'territorial islands” so as to divide equally the territorial waters between them and the main islands.

Dear Belgrave, I have communicated to The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited the gist of our talk on Friday last. Y/hilst the Sheikh has not, apparently, expressed himself in clear and unequivocal terms as to the territory concerned, he would appear to contemplate*' ceding to the Petroleum Concessions Limited and without reference to this Company, a lease of the Hawar Islands and adjoining Mainland territory, claimed by the Sheikh as coming within his domain, leaving whatever balance of territory there might be, for this Company later on to compete for against whosoever might care to interest himself in it. Assuming that the foregoing is, generally speaking, correct, I am asked by the Company to recall to the Sheikh and his Advisers that throughout the earlier negotiations conducted by Major Frank Holmes and recently through me, all parties have had in mind as the so-called additional area, the balance of the territory (including territorial waters) coming within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh, that is after deducting the land and rights conceded to the Company under and through the Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1925. It was on this understanding the Company tendered through me its offer of Rs.400,000 as a premium for a concession of the additional area in July last. My recollection is that this was also your understanding. I have since confirmed to you orally that this offer of a premium was made unconditionally and Belgrave Esq., C.B.E., did/ Court,♦ * did not depend in any way upon proof that the Hawar Islands contain oil-hearing possibilities* Such a confirmation was made possible by the visit to those Islands by one of the Company’s Geologists, a visit which was made with your sanction* ? The Company have never expressed themselves as being interested in acquiring a concession of a portion of the additional area belonging to the Sheikh. In f act. it has been always emphasised that the Company desired^ tq Correct. acquire the whole of the additional area, a desire they still retain. It is here that the Company feel the Sheikh is under a misapprehension. His Excellency might also be under the impression that the Company would not wish to develop the additional area as well and as quickly as another competing Company might do. This is not the case because the Company are prepared to give careful consideration to the desires of the Sheikh as well in this as in other respects. I think you will agree with me that the performance by the Company to date in exploring and developing the territory held by them under their existing Concession is sufficient proof of their ability and initiative in developing an oil field. The Company also believe they are supported in their feeling that there exists a misunderstanding in the minds ? of the Sheikh and his Advisers by the recent assurances To my knowledge no such assurances have been given, this presumably refers to some conversation in Bahrain. given since July last by the Sheikh to the Company, that he wishes the Company to have the rest of his territory to deal with - that is, the additional area. May I now venture to remind you that when the Company first came on the scene they did so in the face of the belief held by some Experts, that the possibilities of oil/♦ * * / f?t&gt; 3. &amp; the Coy*are getting oil. Major Prank Holmes. No such Agreement was made. oil being found within the Sheikh’s territories were negligible. However, using the vast experience at their command and sparing neither time nor money, the Company went ahead to prove their own conviction, with the result that today Bahrein is once again enjoying prosperity. The Company have loyally fulfilled all their obligations to the Sheikh and this without any friction with any of the Sheikh’s Subjects or Advisers. In 1933 the Company, in deference to the wishes of the Sheikh and his Advisers, suspended their then existing application for a concession over the remainder of the Sheikh’s territory, a step which has lost them the services of their sole adviser on local affairs. The Company have opened up a sea-way to within three miles of Sitrah and are now constructing a Refinery which cannot but add to the security, wealth and importance of the Sheikh’s domain. Furthermore, the Company are reluctant to believe that the Sheikh wishes to dis regard the Agreement which you on his behalf and I on behalf of the Company came to in July last for the preferential treatment of this Company. That Agreement, I would recall to you, was that the Company should have the preferential right to the whole of the additional area for Rs.400,000 subject only to the terms and conditions of the Agreement being settled by the Sheikh’s Advisers. However, if the Company must continue to bargain for the additional area they are prepared to do so. In other words, the Company ■would ask that having already done so much for Bahrein, they may have an opportunity of fair bargaining with any others who may appear interested in acquiring the additional area, or a portion of it. The Company/Company cannot 'believe that they are faced with the juxtaposition of a rival concern who would appear to have no claim whatever to be considered in preference to the We informed the Coy.that another Coy. had come into the field.

I send you this letter in triplicate in order to facilitate your bringing it to the immediate notice of the Sheikh and his Advisers. At the same time I am sending a copy of it to the Company in Bahrein in order that they may know the position there with the least possible delay, and so be prepared to carry on and, I hope, successfully conclude there, the negotiations for the additional area if it is found to be impossible to complete them here# Yours, &amp;c.. (Sgd.) H.R. BALLANTYNE.(g) P.2. 7234/36. Junior Army &amp; Navy Club Horse Guards Avenue, q 1 o» »« • j. • 6 .10. 36 Dear Clauson, I savr Ballantyne on Friday, and again today, and Skliros today. Ballantyne’s reaction to my conversation, which v/as on the lines agreed upon when we discussed it the other day, is contained in his letter of which I enclose a copy. He was rather apologetic over it and I fancy it was composed mostly by Hamilton. Skliros said that he would let me know what his Company thought after the meeting of Directors on 14th. I am sure he would be content with the Islands or even some of them. Today I saw Ballantyne again and corrected one or two mistakes in his letter. He then showed me a telegram from Bahrain which arrived today saying that the signs of oil possibilities previously reported as being in Kawar were actually on the mainland adjacent to Hawar, in Qatar. Hawar was now reported as ’'flat and uninteresting”. Ballantyne says that his Company want all or nothing, including Hawar. They don’t want to be ’’shut out of the market” and are prepared to compete against the P.C.L. He is now awaiting a full report on Hawar. For the time being nothing more can be done as far as I am concerned. Yours sincerely Sgd. C.Dalrymple BelgraveAIR MAIL,J9 N0T3 BY COLONEL PO'ELE DATED 12th OCTOBER 1936. P.Z. 7363/36. r B ° Major Holmes lunched with me today, and stated as follows. (You know he is always rather vague). (a) That Mr.Skliros (P.C.L.) appeared to he of the opinion that the HaEAR ISLANDS by themselves would not be good enough, without the addition of the mainland territory. (b) That Mr.Skliros also thought, and Major Holmes rather concurred, that•if the Bahrein Petroleum Company got any additional areas in Bahrein territory, before the Petroleum Concessions Limited had managed to fix their options and concessions, (particularly the options), on the Trucial Coast, this would encourage the Trucial Coast Sheikhs to intrigue with the Bahrein Petroleum Company with the object of giving options, etc. to them rather than to -the—Bah re-in Petroleum Company.. (c) That he - (Major Holmes) had received information from the Petroleum Concessions Limited’s representative in Debai that soon after he - (Major Holmes) had left the Trucial Coast, an Arab on behalf of the Bahrein Petroleum Company had arrived at Debai and approached the Sheikh. The latter had replied that he had made arrangements with Major Holmes, and would not go back on them. (d) That Mr.Skliros hoped that there would not be too great a hurry over demarcating the boundaries of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms, as this might complicate matters as between the Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Sheikhs. 2* With regard to (a). Nothing can be done until Mr.Belgrave on return to Bahrein finds out from the Sheikh exactly what plan the latter has in mind. With/With regard to (fr). I do not think that there is much in this, hut will discuss with Colonel Loch and let you have my views. With regard to (c). If this is true that the Bahrein Petroleum Company have 'been playing rather low down, I will endeavour to confirm in Bahrein, and report. Y/ith regard to (d). This fits in with our views* 3. You will remember we discussed the matter on the above lines with Mr.Walton. 4. I . gave you some papers which Major Holmes gave me, which you kindly said you would return to him C/o. Mr.Longrigg.- 3 - BAHRAIN 3. Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited* (a) Sending one of their employees to investigate oil possibilities at Hawar. (b) Sending Hussain Yateem to Sharjah and Dubai ^ b |? r directly tejor Holmes' back was turned offering to negotiate for oil with t ese two rulers. With reigard to (a) Hawar is part of Bahrain terri tory. The B.P.C's passports are visaed for Bahrain terri tory. P.C.L. have not commenc ed doing anything on these islands and so neither on le&amp;al or other grounds can we take exception. With regard to (b) however the action of the B.P.C. though there is nothing in their agreements to prevent ^ theirjsending a representative, in view of the friendly way in which H.M.G. have treated them this was distinctly low dAwn: X propose tackling Mr. Skinner or/and the C.L. \. on the sub ject and will discuss the matter with Colonel Loch.j^rv — I.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000296_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/688</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000296</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/688</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Confidential 86/14-I.

Offers for the concession area are made by both companies and included in the volume, along with later discussion regarding the possibility of dividing the remaining concession area in two and granting separate concessions, one for the unalloted area on the mainland and the other for the Hawar Islands and other territorial islands. Copies of the draft agreement produced by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and later amendments can be found at folios 5-22, 91-107.Also discussed is the potential of over-lapping rights should a concession be granted for the unallotted area and suggestions that a concession for that area might contain a clause granting subordinate rights in some areas in order to respect rights granted to BAPCO in their agreement. The rights related to access to fresh water, roads and harbours.Further discussion surrounds the ‘Bahrain Islands’ focusing particularly on the Hawar group of islands and whether they were owned by Bahrain, as claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain and could therefore be included in a concession for the unalloted area. The resulting enquiries made by the India Office concluded that it appeared Bahrain owned the islands, and that the burden of disproving ownership rested with any other potential claimant.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 221-227.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000296#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
