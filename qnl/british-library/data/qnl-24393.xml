Mr.Crow suggests that in the circums tances it would be advisable for him to communicate to the - Vali the substance of the instructions sent to him on the 2 nd September 1908, copy of which was sent to you in my despatch Ho.539 of the 2nd September 1908, in order to show him that the intervention of British Consuls in Turkey on behalf of natives of the island is well established and that in 1871, in particular, the then Grand Vizer gave a formal assurance 'that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtain ing the supremacy over Bahrein”. I have informed Mr.Crow that there is no objection to his communicating the substance of the above instructions to the Vali, and, in view of the instructions received by His Excellency on the subject, I do not propose to take any further action in the matter here unless instructed by you to do so.

Sir, IN November last, at the request of the British Resident at Bushire, I informed the Vali that the estate, amounting to less than 200 rupees, of a certain Haji Ali-bin-Haji kahdi, Ottoman subject of Baghdad, who had died at Bahrein, had been transmitted to the British Consul-General at Bagh dad for payment to the deceased’s brother. The vilayet of Bussorah had previously written to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the subject, and the Vali’s letter had been handed by the Sheikh to the British Political Agent at Bahrein for the ne cessary action. The British Resident at Bushire desired me to point out to the Vali that it would save inconvenience if, in future, similar communications were addressed direct by the vilayet to the British Political Agent at Bahrein,' that Island being under British protection. I informed the Vali accordingly. His Excellency seems to have been perturbed at my statement that Bahrein was under British protection, and telegraphed to the Minister of the Interior of Foreign Affairs, asking him whether he should not rebut any such contention on the part of the British Go vernment . In conversation with the Vali today His Excellency told me he had been instructed not to protest against,, but at the same time not to accept, my assertion regarding the status of Bahrein, and he emphatically stated that he could not ad mit that the British Government had ary rights of supremacy over Bahrein. I told His Excellency that both the Turkish and Persian claims to sovereignty over Bahrein had been frequently re butted by His Majesty’s Government for more than 100 years, and that 1 was instructed by the Bmbassy to extend British protection to natives of Bahrein at Bussorah. I instanced the case of Khali1-bin-Ibrahim here, who was taken by the BussorahBussorah authorities for military service in 1908, and on whose behalf the Embassy had made representations v/hich had resulted in orders being sent to the Vali’s predecessor not to interfere with him. As questions regarding the protection of Bahreinese are not of unfrequent occurrence in this district, I might, if you see no objection, communicate either officially or un officially to the Vali the substance of the Ambassador’s despatch of 2nd December 1908, to Mr.Geary, which would serve to show him that the intervention of British Gonsuls in Turkey on behalf of natives of the island is well established. Be fore adopting this course, however, I should be glad to re ceive your instructions, as it seems ^advisable to raise these questions unless there are matters at stake which make it worth while.

Mo. 100 of the 20th February I informed you of the new attitude taken up by the Vali of Lasreh, in conformity with instructions which he has received, in re gard to the status of Bahreinis, and of the directions which I in consequence gave to His Lajesty’s Consul to communi cate to him the contents of the despatch which I had ad dressed to I, r.Crcv/ in September 1908 as reported to you in my despatch Mo.539 of that year. I subsequently received an enquiry from Mr.Crow as to whether he should register natives of Bahrein under Sections 7 and 12, Chapter 27, of the General Consular Ins tructions. He considered that such action would show the local authorities more forcibly the real status of Bahreinis. But it has not been customary in the past to register them, and they appear to fare perfectly well under the present arrangements by which they get the good offices of the Consulate on producing Bahrein certificates of origin signed by the Political Agent, and by which, when travelling to Bagdad, they receive passes from the Consulate stating that they are natives of Bahrein under British' protection. For these considerations, therefore, it appeared to me necessary to make any alteration in the procedure hitherto adopted, and I have instructed His Majesty’s Consul at Basreh.accordingly.

To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 4 Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a lotter which after consultation with you, I addressed yesterday to H.E. Shaikh Sir idiazal j\han on the subject of the title of Bahrainis to protection whilst within his boundaries. e. 2. I have further some to a private arrangement with Agha ’Abdi, Deputy Governor of Mohammerah, wheoeby he undertakes to refer to me informally all cases concerning Bahrainis, whether registered or not, before taking forcible action, on the under standing that I do not interfere with his legitimate rights in the last resort, to imprison recalcitrant debtors and malefactors, after I have satisfied myself by enquiry of the guilt of the accused persons. It is too scon to predict how this arrangement will work in practice, but I am not without hopes that it may gradually ripen into a full recognition of the position we occupy in regard to the people of Bahrain. 3. 1 estimate the number of persons entitled, under the new arrangement, to registration at about 100, out of which about 60 may be expected to avail themselves of the privilege. The number of Bahrainis in ’Arabistan legally entitled to our pro tection i.e. born in Bahrain, or of parents born in Bahrain, is probably from 1000 to 1500, of whom some 500 live in Mohammerah4. •inc: It is t&amp;erofora necessary to be circumspect when offering encouragement or countenance in this locality to Bahrainis applying for British protection and good offices, and I think the present arrangement is quite as wide in its scope as is at present desirable in our own interests here. The arrange ment which has been come to is an informal one between the Shaikh and this Consulate, involving a far fuller recognition of our rights in regard to Bahrein than has yet been conceded by the Persian Government, who would doubtless object strongly were they to hear of the arrangement. I am therefore keeping the existence of this agreement confidential, as far as possible. I have etc. (sd) A.T. Wilson, Lieut I.A.

With reference to my ta&amp;egrams No.56 o - 0 March 99 and 61 of today respecting three natives of Bahrein arrested by the Vail I have the honour to report that, according to passports ^oxmrarded to this Consulate, issued by the Sheikh of Bahrein and duly le galised by the Political Agent in that island, Isea is the son of Haji Ali Bin Haji Ahmed bin Mehdys Hajl Mohamed Husein is the son of Haji Ahmed and Mohamed Salih is the son of Mohamed Ali. These persons are all natives of Bahrein mho have proceeded to Basra on business and their Bahrein passports are dated December 92, 1910, December 24, 1910 and March 3, 1911 respectively. In their letter to me the petitioners state that they are Be IE residing at Hamian and have property at Mohammerah and in Bahrein and proceeded to Basra on private business, that they were sum moned by the Tabcur Agassi to the Vali’s presence on the 6/l9 March, who ordered them to take out Ilufue teskeres as Ottoman sub jects, that, on their refusal the Vali took a guarantee for'their- appearance on the following day when they^put under arrest and have since been detained by the police. I sent my Dragoman to see the (Jornmicsloner of Police in order to ascertain the reason of their arrest but he said he had been ordered by the \eli to give no reply to ary person -from the Consulate who came to enquire about them. I then wrote officially to the Vali, copy enclosed No.29, asking him the cause of their arrest ard pointing out that they were natives of Bahrein ard their passports were ir my hands ard at his disposal if he wished to see them, ard I requested him to allow me to communicate with them and give them the usual Con sular assistance as natives of Bahrein enjoyed British protection.

J 1 ^Tbs men have applied to me again today through their rela tives v/he state that they have now been six days under arrest. The Vali will not admit any interference on my part and as far as I am atle to ascertain no judicial charge has yet been made against then and no action taken at the Public Prosecutor’s office. Under these circumstances 1 have no alternative but to report their case for Your Excellency’s consideration and to suggest that instructions may be telegraphed to the Vali to admit our inter ference on their behalf and to inform me of the charge, if any, made against them. I would remind Your Excellency tf the case of Khalil bin Ib rahim a native of Bahrein who was taken for military service in If08 and refer you to my despatch No.93 of December 31, 1908, reporting his case. In that instance the Vali in a letter No.870 of December 24, 1908 informed me that his orders were to treat Bahreinese in Turkey as Ottoman subjects.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch No.14 of the 25th instant relative to the three Bahreinese arrested by the Vali, I learn that the Vali, finding that the men refused to take out Ottoman Nufus teokeres, handed them over to the Commissioner of Police with instructions to detain them and to draw up a report showing that they were 'dis turbers of the peace'. The men were accordingly accused of applying by letter to Bahrein for papers of protection. This is certainly not an indictable offence and, in any So case, it would have been unnecessary for them to do^, as thsir Bahrein passports are with me. They deny having sent the letter but the police persist in the charge, and they were brought before the Buatantiq on the police report, made at the instigation of the Vali, and warrants S9ji*&amp;S for their imprisonment were issued.

My dear Cox, With reference to previous telegrams about the action of the VaH at Basrah in regard to the Bahreinese, the following telegrams to and from the Embassy have not been repeated to you, but I think it well to send them to you by post for the information of the Government of India. No. 34, dated 2nd April 1911. From—Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. With reference to your telegram No. 56 of March 22nd, last paragraph. Was the Vaii’s official reply to you in writing or was it a verbal answer made to you personally ? In the former case, I think it would be better at present not.to discuss the history and merits of this question with him. No. 70, dated 3rd April 1911. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, To—Ambassador, Constantinople. In reply to your telegram No. 34, regarding the Bahreinese. The reply of the Vali was in writing. I have avoided any discussion of the question with him and have confined myself to communicating to him the substance of your instruc tions m this matter contained in your despatch of September 2nd, 1908, as you informed me in your despatch of February 21st, 1910, in reply to my enquiry on the subject, that you had no objection to my communicating the substance of these instructions to the Vali for his information. No. 33, dated 1st April 1911. * From—Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. Bahreinese. According to instructions which I have received from the Foreign Office I have urged the Minister for Foreign Affairs to despatch instruc tions immediately to the Vali of Basrah to release the natives of Bahrein now in2 prison and to accept their Bahrein passports. I hope I may receive to-morrow a reply from His Excellency informing me as to the nature of the instructions he has sent to the Vali. No. 36, dated 3rd April 1911. From—Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. With reference to my telegram No. 33, Bahreinese. Instructions were telegraphed to the Vali of Basrah yesterday telling him to release the Bahreinese on bail. The Vali’s reply to this was contained in my telegram No. 7.4 of April 5th, which I repeated to you the same day. Yours sincerely, F. E. CROW. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. 17 F.

Z.Cox, C.S.I., C.LE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 319, dated the nth April 1911, I have the honour to forward, herewith, copies of the Despatch No. 33, dated April . s „ from correspondence noted in the margin, which His Majesty’s Consul, B^srah. has taken place between His Majesty’s ,r0m H!S Ambassador, Constantinople, and His Telegram No 41, dated 13th-15th April iqit, Majesty s Consul, Basrah, on the subject Ap'ul9'Mrom of ‘he treatment oi three Bahreinese by the His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. Vali of Basrah, No. 23. Sir, Basrah; April nth t igi 1 . In continuation of my despatch No. 15 of the 30th ultimo, regarding the three Bahreinese imprisoned by the Vali, I have the honour to report that the Alay Begi disgraced and humiliated them unnecessarily, while in confinement, by making them sweep his room and clean his tables and furniture, abusing them at the same time for changing their Ottoman nationality. This complaint was brought to me by friends of the prisoners and afterwards confirmed by themselves on their release. The object of this treatment of respectable land-owners seems to have been to compel them in their distress to accept the Ottoman taskeres offered them. There have been other cases in which pressure has been brought to bear on Bahreinese at Basrah by the local authorities with the same object— and, in some instances, they have yielded to the demands of the Turks. On receipt of Your Excellency’s telegram No. 36 of April 3rd informing me that instructions had been sent to the Vali on the 2nd instant to release the prisoners on bail, I sent my dragoman on the 5th instant to His Excellency to enquire if these instructions had been received and carried out. As reported in my telegram Mo. 74 of April 5, the Vali said that the Consul must be wiser than the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as he was aware it was a criminal case and a Vali has nothing to do with Courts of Justice and, although he had got the telegram in question, he had paid no attention to if and had merely put it in his bag. The Vali added that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was a fool (budala) to have given such instructions and the Ambassador should not accept such an answer, and he thought the Minister for Foreign Affairs must have*been laughing at the Ambassador, as the former knew that in their Consti tutional days there could be no interference with the proceedings of Courts of Jus tice. The Vali concluded his remarks by saying, if the dragoman had the right to attend in such cases, the Minister of Justice should issue instructions accord ingly. I had already instructed a lawyer to watch proceedings on behalf of the Bahreinese and to assist them in drawing up petitions and other Court matters. The matter proceeded and, after examination before the Mustantiq, two of the men were discharged on April 6th, there being no case against them. The papers of the third, howeverj were sent to the Public Prosecutor, by whom the prisoner was changed—I quote textually—“with a seditious attempt to induce the inhabi tants (presumably of Hamdan) to put themselves under British protection and with disturbing the security of the Vilayet of Basrah by this attempt ’’ There seems to have been no evidence whatever against the prisoner and the alleged letter asking, I am informed, some one in Bahrein for passports, is stated not to have been in the hand-writing of the accused. The charge was a grave one coming und^f the Supplement to Article 54 of the Penal Code, for which the maximum penalty is death and the minimum penalty five years’ imprisonment.s 2 The Public Prosecutor referred the case to the Chambre des mines on accu sation at Basrah, the President of which happens to be a Christian and an inti mate friend of my dragoman, Mr Naoum Abbo. The latter carefully explained the whole history of the proceedings to him and, when the case came before him officially, he had no hesitation in acceding to the private representations of the Consulate and discharged the accused immediately. The prisoner was released on April 8th and visited me on April 10th when I telegraphed to Your Excel lency. I think Your Excellency will agree that the whole proceedings are infamous and that the Vali has flagrantly abused his authority in the matter and I trust that no opportunity may be lost of getting him superseded. I have, etc., F. E. CROW. His Excellency The Right Henable Sir G. A. Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., etc., etc., etc. Telegram No. 39, dated 9th (received 10th) April 1911. From—Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. r I received your telegram No. 75 of April 7th to-day. Yesterday April 8th, I addressed a Note to the Sublime Porte in which I demanded the unconditional release of the Bahreinese and the acceptance of their passports.

From—Ambassador, Constantinople, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. * Referring to your telegrams Nos. 72 (?) and 78 Bahreinese. Were all the prisoners released unconditionally or was there any question of bail ? As regards the last part of your telegram No. 78 I do not understand your reasons for the advice given by you to the natives of Bahrein in connection with my telegram No 31 as stated by you. Telegram No. 81, dated the J5th April 1911. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, To—Ambassador, Constantinople. In reply to your telegram No. 41. All the prisoners were unconditionally released in the ordinary process of law, two of-them by the Examining Magis- ^-trate, who dismissed the charge on April 6th and the third by the Resident of the Ithamiye Court, who quashed proceedings on April 8th before the present ation of the Embassy Note referred to in your telegram No. 39. As regards the advice given by me, it did not seem to me prudent after having obtained their release to insist locally on the illegality of their detention from March 20th to March 26th, the date on which the warrants were issued, pending the solution of the questions enumerated in your telegram No. 31, as the Vali might find some pretext for again arresting them and so complicate your negotiations.

'ou state,without qualification, that such persons- are treated locally as other subjects of the Sheikh. In this connection I would invite your attention to the private arrangement mentioned in paragraph 3 of H. h r, s Acting Consul at Muhammerah's letter No.list dated 31st October 1910 and to the last p rgraph of the seme Officer's letter to Sheikh Khazal dated 30th October 1910, wnich seem to indicate that the original intention was to maintain the right of listening to appeals by non-register- ed Bahrainis, and^where necessary^of supporting them with our'good offices'. ^beiJ.h of Bahrain was ignorant of the arrangement with Sheikh Khazal, and was complaining that Bahrain subjects were.being refused the assistance of the British Consulate at Muhammerah which they formerly enjoyed I explained the position to him in tire light of the Agree ment Of the 30th October 1910 as I construed it- practical!, to the effect that it was not a question of withdrawing support previously granted, but of increasing it and of putting it on a regular basis in certain cases. y If this is not the view taken on the spot and //-N the effoct of the A«5r»wnent ia really i:,o withdraw from It non-registered ’’ahral is in Muhamerah territory any decree of protection of which they have been recipients in the past, it is important that I should be informed of the fact as it may bo necessary to modify tie assurances X have hiven the Sheikh. 6 Anjr movrjmant in the direction of denying protec tion, however shadowy or ineffective previously granted v.ill of course be extremely unpoptilar here, and I doubt whether the strengthening of the position of a limited class will be yarded as at all an adequate coripensation. Of course I am aware that the Agreement ’.res the issue found,with some trouble,out of a difficult situation in ’frihamerah and that in comparison with what might have b-'-n it is probably highly advantageous to the Bahrainis. I however am only called on to consider the question from tue point of view of fneikh leads feelings ami of popular opinion in Bahrain, which are modor ted by no knowl -&gt;dge of “-ho difficulties of the situation. If the Agreement is interpreted in practice in the sense in which I have r ?ad it, no one of course will have any e-cuse for co-plaint, or discontemvent. 1 ara ior^ardiaq a copy oi hie letter to the Poli tical Pasi lent in the Persian (tulf# I have the honour to be* Sir, v our uost oba tiant servant.[Confidential.] No. 732, dated Bushire, the 19th (received 27th) March 1911.

Teheran, 23rd December igio. No. 235. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 114 of the 26th of July 1909 ( 27788 ) respecting the question of the status of Bahrainis in Persia, I have the honour Bushire No. 75-2891. to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire, pointing out that the security and prosperity now existing at Moham- merah have attracted considerable numbers of immigrants from Bahrain, who demand to be registered at His Majesty’s Consulate and brought under British protection. This has attracted the attention of other Bahrainis, resident at Mohammerah, who now claim similar treatment. Colonel Cox when at Mohammerah in October last discussed the matter with the Shaikh and the solution arrived at on that occasion is embodied in the letter from His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah to Shaikh Khazal which forms enclosure 3 in this despatch. I venture to express the opinion that the arrangement seems an eminently satisfactory one, especially in view of the private agreement come to by Lieute nant Wilson with the Deputy Governor of Mohammerah referred to hi the second paragraph of Lieutenant Wilson’s despatch to Colonel Cox, No. 116s of the 21st of October. I I would propose subject to your concurrence to approve the action of Colonel Cox, and Lieutenant Wilson in this matter.

Correspondence at the beginning and end of the file is dated 1909 to 1913 (ff 2-16, ff 52-87), and discusses the British protection of Bahrainis in Ottoman Turkey, in response to Ottoman Government representatives in Constantinople [Istanbul] questioning Britain’s claim of Bahrain being under its protection, and the registration and status of the increasing numbers of Bahrainis residing in the port of Mohammerah [Khorramshahr], thanks to that port’s relative stability and affluence. Some of this correspondence deals with a specific incident occurring in March 1911 in which three Bahrainis were detained by the Basra authorities, with the latter refusing to recognise that the men were under British protection (ff 56-63).
