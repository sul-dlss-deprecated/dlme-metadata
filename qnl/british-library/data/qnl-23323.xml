Mr .Abdul t^ayum, however, to his lasting credit, chose the tnornier path, and on hearing the state of affairs from him, I pressed His ji&amp;cellency from time to time to use his influence in looking the boys work, and the Inspector of Mcuation was brought in to teach the boys Arabic. As a result of these two officers activities the alarming dis covery was made that the younger boys knew practically nothing, even the A.B.C.of Arabic, and consequently could not benefit from an English teacning teacher, and that the elders had an imperfect knowledge of their mother tongue and but the haziest ideas of mathematics; in fact the good work done at Mr Van Ess's school three years ago had been completely undone. As the boys are still in need of so much instruction which can only be given in their mother tongue it seemed best that some reliable Arab should now be engaged, and since the ice has been broken and a precedent of a short period of dail^ created he should be able to carry on provided he receives support from the Adviser and Political Agent* His Excellency would quite cheerfully see his aoas grow up illiterate, provided that they understood the lore of falconry, which he considers the only subject repaying careful instruction. I truet therefore that the Government of India will not object to the return o f Mr Abdul Clayum to his province, and that the Ajmer administration will be able to provide for him on the expiry of his leave. 5. I do not wish to convey the impression that his deputation has been fruitless. I do not think that any man without an assured future and a sincere desire to do his duty could have achieved anything,and in getting the boys to do any work at ail, and even to start games ,he has moved mountains. He countered in turn every wile that boyhood can produce and self interest invent, and stuck to his guns with a courage that does him the greatest credit, isolated as ne^as at Sakhir for the greater part of uis time at Bahrein, further, he made thr' valutable discovery that Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad was not as had generally been supposed)somewhat weajoainded hut that hia© Uo.398 of 1349 Offict of th« Adviser to tixo Ooverniaent, Balirein Dated I9tli R/Aw&amp;l 1349 • 13th August 1930 e To H„ S, ]l f a Political Agent, BaLiraiUo MEMO.
