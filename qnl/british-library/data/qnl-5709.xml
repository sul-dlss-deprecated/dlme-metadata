Jeddah Consulate.—Captain Beyts. These papers having been considered in the Committee of Statistics and Commerce, have now been referred to the Political Committee by the Under Secretary of State, in accordance with the following Eesolution recorded by the Statistics Committee:— '.The Committee so strongly feel the necessity of having at Jeddah a Consul free from any connection with private trade, that they recom mend that these and previous papers be referred to the Political Committee, for consideration as cc to the steps which should be adopted.' The particular paper which has given rise to this Resolution is a letter from the Resident at Aden, dated the 6th February last, reporting proceedings in his Court against the steam ship 'Medina,' chartered by Beyts &amp; Co. for the conveyance of pilgrims from Jeddah to the Straits Settlements, which resulted in the master being sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 for breaches of the Native Passenger Ships Acts, 1870 and 1872. The real defendants were the British India Steam Company, as owners of the ' Medina.' In reporting the case, General Schneider submits that the facts disclosed in the inquiry are suffi ciently damaging against Consul Beyts, as agent of the Steam Company at Jeddah, to warrant the Secretary of State for India being moved to recom mend to Lord Derby that that officer should cease to hold the office of Her Majesty's Consul at that port. I apprehend that the question which the Com mittee are asked to consider is, not the propriety or otherwise of the sentence passed in the Resident's Court at Aden in the case of the •' Medina,' but the advisability of suggesting to the Foreign Office the removal of Consul Beyts from his post at Jeddah, and arrangements on a new basis for the performance of the Consular duties there. To assist the Committee in arriving at a con clusion, it will perhaps be convenient to recapi tulate what has passed on the subject of the Jeddah Consulate since 1852. In that year, the Court of Directors* sanctioned the appointment of an Agent at Jeddah, in succes sion to Mr. Ogilvie, who had filled the post since 1837, and upon the same salary, viz., 200/. a year. In so doing the Court wrote as follows :— &lt;e We ' have further to inform you that Her Majesty's ' Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will confer 19271. I. 243. Ate the office of Yice-Consul on the person you may te appoint, .... and that His Xiordship conteni- ' plates recommending to the Lords of Her Majesty s ' Treasury to assign to such Yice-Consul a salary of 150^. per annum.' Under the sanction thus conveyed, Mr. Cole, ot the Indian Navy, was appointed on the terms stated; he received, however, a personal allowance of 1001. per annum on account of previous claims. Mr. Cole retired in 1859. On the 1st ^February in that year the Foreign Office wrote to this Office that Lord Malmeshury had appointed Mr. G. E. Stanley to he British Vice-Consul at Jeddah ; that he would, in that capacity, receive from the Foreign Office a salary of 300^. a year, would be restricted from engaging in commercial pursuits, and would also be required to account for fees which he might receive; that he would be placed under the super intendence of Her Majesty's Consul General at Constantinople; and that Lord Malmesbury would be glad to know what salary would be given from the India Office. In reply,* it was stated that the Secretary of State in Council was willing to fix Mr. Stanley's Indian allowances at the same rate as had been paid to Mr. Cole, viz., 200^. a year. It was, at the same time, pointed out that the latter gentleman had been appointed Agent at Jeddah by the Com pany's Government, and as such had been nomi nated Her Majesty's Consul, and that Lord Stanley was not aware why in the case of Mr. Stanley the practice should be reversed. Nothing more seems to have passed on this point. In reportingf the arrangement to the Govern ment of Bombay, Sir C. Wood wrote that Mr. Stanley's Indian allowances, payable from the Bombay Treasury, consisted of 200^. per annum as part salary, with 50/. per annum for an interpreter, and 40/. per annum for the maintenance of two janissaries. This is the first mention of any al lowance from Indian revenues for office establish ment. ^ Mr. Stanley (as appears from the Foreign Office list) was transferred from Jeddah to Alexandria in April 1864. No communication on the subject was made to this Office. At least none can be traced. The Vice-Consulate at Jeddah had been raised to a Consulate in July 1860. Mr. Haby was appointed Consul, in succession to Mr. Stanley, on the 23rd July 1865. The appoint ment was made by the Foreign Office without any reference to this Office. We did not even know until January 1867 that the appointment k&lt;xd been made, and then acquired the information from Mr. Baby himself, who, being in this country on leave granted by the Foreign Office, applied for the arrears of his Indian allowance. Payment of that allowance was ultimately sanctioned at the same rate as heretofore, viz. 200/. a year salary, and 90/. a year office al lowance. ♦ Mr. Melvill to 17th February 1859. Foreign Office, dated f No. 13 (Political), dated 7th July 1859.0 * Political, No. 70, dated 8th June 1871. ,1 f Letter from Foreign Office, dated 13th December 1871. Mr. Raby continued Consul at Jeddah until the 31st August 1871, but during this period of a little more than six years he was only present at his post for two years and seven months. During the remaining three and a half years he was absent on leave, granted by the Poreign Office, his duties being, apparently, performed by Mr. Sourian, the Dragoman of the Consulate. On the 18th April 1871, a letter was written by the Foreign Office to this Office, in anticipation of Mr. Raby's transfer to another post, stating that it appeared from that gentleman's reports that British interests at Jeddah were limited to periodical visits on the part of steamers of various private companies af the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca, and to a certain amount of trade carried on between Jeddah and Indian ports in vessels bearing the British flag, and owned by Native Indian subjects of Her Majesty. Under these circumstances, while Lord Granville thought it desirable that a British Agent should be stationed at Jeddah, his Lordship did not consider that Imperial interests at that port required the maintenance of a salaried consular officer, and accordingly proposed that the salary which might be assigned to Mr. Baby's successor should be entirely provided out of Indian funds. This proposal was referred* to the Government of India, who replied in a letter dated the 6th January 1872, No. 10. Meanwhile Mr. Sourian, who had been left in charge of the Consulate by Mr. Baby, had been compelled by his health to leave J eddah, making over charge to a Mr. Johar, a British Indian subject residing there, and Mr. Johar, leaving in his turn, had transferred the duties to another British Indian subject named Hafi»-ood-deen. Her Majesty's Con sul General in Egypt, in reporting these movements to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, represented that, ' considering the importance of ' the British interests at that port,' it was desirable ' that a duly qualified consular officer should be £&lt; appointed to it without delay.' Sir H. Elliott (24ith November 1871) expressed his concurrence in this opinion, with especial reference to the difficulties arising out of the quarantine regulations consequent on the prevalence of cholera, and the Eoreign Office took the opportunity of pressing this Office for an early decision on Lord Granville's proposal. In referring the question to India, the Duke of Argyll had made the following suggestion:—' I ' incline to tlie opinion that, with advertence to the ' increasing importance to British and Indian in- ' terests of the Bed Sea, consequent on the opening ' of the Suez Canal, and of the ports (namely, Mas- ' sowah. Mocha, Hodeida, Jeddah, and Yembo) on its ' Arabian and African coasts, it is expedient that ' a Consul and Agent, on a salary of Bs. 500 ' monthly, be appointed for the Bed Sea, to be « politically subordinate to the Besident at Aden.' Prom this wiggestion, the Government of India, intheir letter of the 6th January 1872, dissented; they did not think that Indian interests required such an appointment, or that, even were a steamer provided, it would be possible for any one person satisfactorily to discharge the consular duties at so many detached places. As regards Jeddah, they adopted the opinion of the Government of Bombay, which was based upon views expressed by the then Hesident at Aden, and the Collector of Customs at Bombay, viz., that there were sufficient Indian and English interests concerned to render it advisable that there should, as heretofore, be a British representative at Jeddah, paid partly from Indian, partly from Im perial, revenues, but that the entire cost should »ot be thrown upon the Indian Treasury. The Government of India added that they would not object to continue their present contribution, 200^. a year (it was in fact 290/), or even to raise it to 300/., but this amount was the utmost which, in their opinion, could properly be defrayed from Indian revenues. In expressing to the Foreign Office* his con- # Letter to Foreign Office, dated 25tli April currence in the views of the Government of India, 1872, the Duke of Argyll observed:— c&lt; The information ' before His Grace convinces him that the larger &lt;c number of pilgrims who pass through Jeddah, O on ' their way to Mecca, are not Her Majesty's Indian &lt;£ subjects. The majority come rather from the ' west, being subjects of France, Eussia, or the Porte, the relations of which countries are with ' the Imperial Government, through the Foreign tc Office, or from the Malayan Archipelago which, ' in like manner, is connected with the Colonial ' Office.' There was, therefore, no reason why the whole cost of the Consulate should be thrown on the Indian exchequer; but His Grace in Council would be willing to grant a liberal contribution towards the furtherance of any scheme which might be agreed upon with the Imperial Government for the promotion of the important interests involved. The Foreign Office did not reply until the 11th December 1872, when Lord Granville stated that, m it appeared from reports received from Sir H Jilhot and General Stanton that quarantine arrano-e- ments m regard to ships bearing passengers to and irom x\\a west could be more effectually carried out at Suez than at Jeddah, and as the only ground upon which his Lordship would feel justified in recom- mending to the Treasury to keep up a salaried officer at the latter port would have been tha necessity for n , , 0 J Cer . t0 , enforee quarantine, his Lordship had finally decided not to restore the Jeddah Con sulate to the consular estimates. At the same time to n ™W attei ? ti ° 11 t0 despatches from thp I 1 and General Stanton, recommending the appointment of an officer at Jeddah to enforce proper amngements on board ships conveyin- pilgrims from and to the east, which, as beiiL a matter appertaining exclusively to Indian and in the case of pilgrims from the Straits Settlements, S' ■■■■•■ ■ ,■■■ : . : i l I • t ' -i •'•■fiiiw*.-■ ' O i i 1 5tE April From Foreign Office, dated 3rd April 1874. f Letter to Foreign Office, dated 3rd April 1873. # Colonial j interGsts, could not be considGred in relation to Imperial expenditure. In a letter dated 3rd February 1873, the Secretary of State m Council expressed Ms total dissent from tne abovG vigws , whether regard were had to com- mercial or sanitary considerations. With respect to the latter it was pointed out that if cholera, or any other contagious disease, were onco brought into Arabia by the Mahomcdan pilgrims who landed at Jeddah, it would be spread in all directions by the caravans returning from Mecca, which were in the habit of taking four different land routes. Whether, therefore, quarantine were or were not established at Suez, it was indispensable that a British consular officer should be stationed at Jeddah, charged with the duty of regulating the passage of pilgrims thioLigh that port, and, as such pilgrims consisted not only of British Indian, but of Russian, Turkish, Persian, Uzbeg, and even Chinese and Malay sub jects, the question was one which affected Imperial fully as much as Indian interests. The Duke of Argyll trusted that Lord Granville would reconsider the matter; in a contrary event. His Grace did not consider Indian interests sufficiently concerned to justify him in throwing upon Indian revenues the entire cost of the Consulate, and in that case the maintenance of the post was impossible. In reply,* Lord Granville stated that he proposed to instruct Sir Bartle Frere (then on his mission to Zanzibar) to institute full inquiries into the matter on his return home; it would then, again be fully considered in its bearing on Imperial interests. In expressing f the satisfaction of the Duke of Argyll with this assurance, occasion was taken to forward to the Foreign Office copy of a letter from the Government of India (No. 34, dated 14th February 1873), from the enclosures to which it appeared that, apart from other reasons, the appointment of a Consul at Jeddah was necessary to check a par ticularly repulsive traffic in slaves which was /carried on. between that port and Souakin, the outlet of the Galla and White Nile slave districts. No reference to Sir Bartle Frere, or any report from him, on the subject of the Jeddah Consulate can be traced. Nothing more was heard in the matter until October 1873, when Mr. Mackinnon, the chairman of the British Indian Steam Com pany, addressed the Foreign Office in regard to it. Mr. Mackinnon stated that his Company was about to run a steamer which would call at Jeddah twice in every four weeks ; that the commercial interests likely to be developed by this service would necessitate the appointment of a Resident British Consul there; that the Company proposed to appoint as their Agent at Jeddah 4 4 Captain Beyts, ' a nautical officer, for many years well and ' favourably known along the whole coast line of c ' India,' whose brother was protector of immi grants at Mauritius, and who was himself ' a pro- ' ficient in the French, Arabic, and Hindustani ' languages,' and also ' possessed of great tact in 19271. B tl9'dealing with the natives of India and othei «oriental countries.' Mr. Mackmnon recom mended the appointment of Captain Beyus as British Consul at Jeddah 'as a measure likely to ' be beneficial to the Government service and to the ' public interest generally,' and he had ' reason to believe that Captain Beyts would prove a^ most ft efficient and valuable Government servant. In referring * the matter to this Office, -Lord Granville expressed his concurrence 'in the ' necessity which in commercial and othei m- ' terests ' existed for the re -establishment oi the Consulate, and inquired whether the appointment of Captain Beyts would meet with the approval of the Duke of Argyll, and whether the Government of India would be prepared to pay half the emolu ments to be assigned to the post, which his Lord ship suggested should be fixed at 4s00l. a year, including office expenses. In reply, it was stated t that the Duke of Argyll concurred in opinion with Lord Granville that it was ' highly desirable that an efficient Consul, to ' represent the interests of both the Imperial and ' Indian Governments, should forthwith be ap pointed at Jeddah;' that the advantage of combining the consular duties with those of the agency of the British India Steam Company, as suggested by Mr. Mackinnon, was ' self-evident and that His. Grace would ' cordially approve ' of Captain Beyts' nomination, if Lord Granville should appoint him to the post, on a salary of 400Z. a year, of which the Indian Government would pay one half. In a letter dated the 23rd February 1874, the Foreign Office intimated the Queen's approval of Captain Beyts' appointment, and his appointment accordingly. It was added, ' Captain Beyts has ' been informed that no salary is assigned to the ' post, but that he will receive an allowance of ' 400J. a year for office expenses.' The object of this last arrangement was not stated. Captain Beyts having hesitated to accept the appointment, lest its duties might interfere with the visits to the other ports of the Red Sea which he might find it necessary to make in his capacity of agent to the British Indian Steam Company, the Foreign' OfficeJ expressed an opinion that such occasional absences need be no obstacle to his ac cepting the post, as he would be able to gain much valuable information in reference to, and do mnch towards checking, the slave trade, while there was reason to suppose that he would have a British vlce G Contuf eddah W ^ 0 migllt be a PP ointed unpaid The concurrence of Lord Salisbury in this view Foreigi1 offlce ^ aietterdated In regard to the present position of the Con sulate, it only remains to note that, in order to avoid a repetition of questions in respect to leave, as arose m ^ baby's case, the Secretary of * From Foreign Office, dated 29th October 1873. f Letter to Foreign November 1873.

It was stated,—' That &lt;£ officer will be regarded as entirely under the ' control of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for «« ^ orei ^ 11 with whom it will rest to provide te that Indian, as well as Imperial, interests shall be at all times properly represented.' The above are all the material facts bearing on the position of the Jeddah Consulate generally in respect to the Imperial and Indian Governments, and the circumstances connected with the particular appointment of Captain Beyts as Consul. That gentleman, since his assumption of office, has, as the Committee are aware, been involved in ceaseless discussions with his colleagues, with the Turkish and Egyptian sanitary officials, with the resident merchants, and with the authorities at Aden, arising out of allegations made against him of systematic abuse of his consular position in favour of the firm of Beyts &amp; Co. in matters con nected with the pilgrim traffic. The cases of the &lt;c Dahlia ' and ' America' were before the Com mittee last year, and led to the following letter being addressed to the Foreign Office on the 14th June:— &lt;£ I am directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to ' acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Lister's letters of the 21st March and 18th April last, with their enclosures, regarding the cases of the ships 4 Dahlia and ' America,' and the supervision exercised by the British Consul at Jeddah over the pilgrim traffic of that port. ' Lord Salisbury has read these papers with much regret, and cannot but regard them as revealing a state of things at Jeddah not creditable to the representative of the British Government, and fraught with danger both to the pilgrims em barking at that place and to the populations of neighbouring ports. ' It is impossible to doubt that the position of Captain Beyts is compromised by his connection with a mercantile firm at J eddah, itself interested in the pilgrim traffic; and Lord Salisbury has had under his serious consideration the propriety of suggesting to Lord Derby that Captain Beyts should be required either to sever his connection with the firm in question, or to resign his appoint ment as Her Majesty's Consul. Having regard, however, to the correspondence which took place at the time when that appointment was made, and to the difficulty which might be experienced in finding a person, without local interests, willing either to accept the office on the scale of pay and allowances sanctioned by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, or, having accepted it, to reside at his post. Lord Salisbury thinks that it may be inexpedient to press the above alternative on Captain Beyts. 19271. C « « (S (« C{ (( ft (C t( tf (C (C K (( (( &lt;( C| ct (t ft &lt;e (t (t (C (( St cc ft ixo' His Lordship, however, trusts that Lord Derby ' will seriously warn that officer of the necessity ' for special vigilance and impartiality in the con- ' duct of his duties connected with the pilgrim ' traffic, and for harmonious co-operation with the ' sanitary authorities of the port, which is imposed ' upon him by his ambiguous position. f ct Lord Salisbury desires further to suggest that ' Consul Beyts should be required to furnish full . ' periodical reports of his proceedings; that, as ' proposed in his letter of the 31st March last, his ' duties in reference to pilgrim traffic should, as ' far as possible, be defined ; and that he should be ' armed with such legal powers as may be available g ' to enable him to discharge those duties satis- ' factorily.' It does not appear from the papers now sent on from the Statistics Committee whether any t action was taken by the Foreign Office on the above letter. If so, it has been without appre ciable effect. The papers in the case of the ' Medina ' have given rise to the present reference. ^ Since their receipt, further papers have come into the Office, including a complaint made against Captain Beyts by the Netherlands Consul a Jeddah, who alleges that a large number of pilgrims bound for the Dutch East Indian possessions were booked for a steamer chartered by Beyts &amp; Co. ; that the pilgrims were detained at Jeddah for weeks, waiting the arrival of the steamer in question; that meanwhile other steamers bound for the pilgrims' destination came in, and sailed away half empty ; and that Beyts &amp; Co.'s steamer was finally despatched very much over crowded, and with special instructions not to call at Aden. In his letter, No. 268, dated the 19th September last, Major Goodfellow, the Officiating Resident at Aden, drew attention to Captain Beyts' pro ceedings, and to the discredit which his connection with trade brought upon the Indian Government, such connection being quite unintelligible to the natives of India with whom he had to deal, as being entirely opposed to the practice in India. Major Goodfellow strongly advocated that the grant now made from Indian revenues towards the expenses of the Consulate should be increased, so as to ensure the appointment of an independent Government official at Jeddah, who would be able not only to control the pilgrim traffic, but to open fnendly relations with the Shereef at Mecca, the spiritual head of Islam. General Schneider, the Resident, in a letter dated the 6th November last. No. 318, has endorsed 1 Major Goodfellow s suggestion, and considers that « ^ ^ S Ti p0l '7 , ' to station a Political „ officer ^ the Indian Government, with Consular rN^ wTrtflt 1 itf t . rr i he Bomba - v Government ^ (No. 80, dated 4th December 1876) have expressed their concurrence, and have been informed in reply (No. 1, dated the 11th January 1877) that 4 A9 the^ Secretary of State will reserve his opinion until he is in possession of the views of the Crovernment of India. It can scarcely be doubted that the existing consular anangements at Jeddah are becoming a scandal, and the Secretary of State in Council will probably not hesitate to express an opinion to that effect to the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs, upon whom rests the responsibility of pro viding that ' Indian ' as well as Imperial interests are at all times properly represented.' The question is, whether the Secretary of State in ^ Council will content himself with expressing this opinion, or whether he will at the same time make specific proposals for remedial measures, and if so, what those proposals shall be. It can scarcely be expected that any communi cation to the Foreign Office which does not embody some practical suggestions will lead to immediate result, while it may be regarded as certain that any suggestion involving an increase of expenditure will be received with disfavour. It is, on the other hand, clear that the experi ment of appointing a trader as Consul at Jeddah has failed, and ought not to be repeated; while it is unlikely that any competent European, restricted from trade, whether selected from the Consular or Indian service, will accept the appointment on the present terms of 400/. a year. No efficient arrangement, therefore, can be anti cipated which shall not involve some increase to the present annual charge. There is, however, no reason whatever why that increase should fall on the Indian more than on the Imperial exchequer. The interests involved are, as has been shown in the correspondence, European and Oriental in the widest sense of the terms. All Europe is concerned from a sanitary point of view; and although no one Euro pean State may be as actively interested in the pilgrim traffic as is India, yet the aggregate of pil grims from eastern countries (exclusive of India) either independent, or the possessions of the various States of Europe, probably equals, if it does not surpass, the aggregate of pilgrims from British India. Of the 493 persons on board the ' Medina,' 468 were Malays bound to the Straits Settlements. On this point, the following extract from a recent number of the ' Bombay Times,' gives some in formation :— ' The pilgrim season just closed was not remark- ' able for the falling off in the number of hadjis, as ' was supposed. Notwithstanding the troubled state ' of affairs in European Turkey, there were about ' 17,000 persons who came on pilgrimage via Egypt '• or the Suez Canal, a fair proportion of whom ' were Turks from Syria and the Levant. From ' Singapore, Java, and the Straits the number of ' pilgrims had increased, amounting fully to 8,000 ' souls, which figure compares favourably with pre- ' vious years. From Bombay, over 6,000 hadjis ' have accomplished the pilgrimage.'10 The commercial ^Sf Man; wWle ^ Vsf' SSlfa''' TZ, S 'i UdM esclusively to India, may be set the purely Imperial interest m the suppression of the Eed Sea slave trade, of which ^The 1 present contribution from Indian revenues is 200?. a year. The Government of India have already expressed their willingness to raise that con tribution to 300/. a year, which is 10/. m excess of what was paid up to 1871, and equal to the tormoi 'TfS'rilW.. th^toe, to oonuteation whetlier, in forwarding these papers to the Foreign Office, it might not be stated that the Secretary oi State in Council is of opinion that the^ position of the Jeddah Consulate should be reconsidered; that the restriction against the Consul engaging in trade, which was enforced up to the time of Captain Beyts' appointment, should be revived; that Cap tain Beyts' connection with the firm of Beyts &amp; Co. renders his retention of the post of Consul undesir able ; that his employment in that capacity should be accordingly terminated; that a successor should be appointed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to whom the Secretary of State in Council would be prepared to give an allowance of 400Z. a year, provided that the Imperial Government would grant an equal sum; and that any fees received, for which (as at present) the Consul should be re quired to account, should be shared between the two Governments in reduction of expenditure. No statement having ever been received of the fees taken at the Jeddah Consulate, the Foreign Office have lately been asked to furnish one. It is be lieved that the amount, whatever it be, has gone entirely into the Imperial Treasury^ According to the Foreign Office list, the sum received in the year 1875-76 was 349Z. A. W. M.
