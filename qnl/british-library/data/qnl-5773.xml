I am in entire agreement with the first paragraph of your telegram. The transfer of the whole of the Wadi Sirhan, with the exception 0 f aarak, to Bin 3aud as proposed by him is wholly unacceptable: so also is his sugg estion th*t his territory should touch the Eedjaz railway at Tibook. The alternative proposal that Bin Saul's adminis tration should retain Jauf is also open, though in a less degree, to the objections specified m your telegram. I would put forward for consideration the suggestion that fcoth parties should disinterest themselves in the Wadi dir ban and withdraw their respective forces from Kaf and Jauf leaving in the area jpa the possession of Nuri 3 ha' lan a s an independent Amir. This was m effect the position until recently. Abdullah would consent to this . Both sides should with draw simultaneously, British officers proceeding to Jauf from Iraq and to Kaf from Palestine to guarantee evaouation. ^zrak being necessary to the air route would be excluded from this proposal and would remain under the administration of Trans-jordania. 1 have not consulted Nuri Sha'lan in connection wi^ this proposal but he would concur in it.

Beyond maintaining the Status Quo by defend- ing and garrisoning it, Abdullah has made no hostile move in the direction of Jauf. H.M.Govt. do not anticipate and have no intention of encouraging any such aggression, and are confident that the Sultan for his part will recall his force and restrain his followers from attacking Kaf, which is at present occupied by Ti*ans-Jordanian forces. They note from the Sultan's pvply reported in Baghdad telegram No.850 of December 6 th 1022 to their own proposal for final frontier, that there is no substantial difference of opinion about the general line which the frontier should follow. They consider the matter could be easily settled by direct negotiation between the Arab rulers concerned, and are prepared, as in the case of the Iraq-Nejd frontier, to use their good offices in securing a final settlement.

King Feisai then induced Abdullah to stop concentration of his defence forces on the understanding that Feisai vfould on return here obtain the consent of H. M. Government through me to his asking Ibn Saud to meet him at the earliest possible moment and discuss all affairs pending between Ibn Saud and territories subject to the Hashimite family. He now asks me to arrange meeting between himself and Ibn Saud and to accompany him to the meeting place. Since writing this letter, Feisai has received definite news that numbers of Ibn saud f s (one group) tribes on the Western boundary of Iraq, including the Amarat sections, have been summoned by ibn saud to march on Jauf and started for the purpose a week ago* They should bo near Jauf in about ten days. He suggests messages should be sent by aeroplane or otherwise to the advancing force requesting them to stand fast until they receive fresh communications11 from Ibn SQ-ud, and that at the same time I send a message to Ibn saud informing him on behalf of Pei sal that unless he consents to enter into negotiations regarding Trans-Iordan frontier, his subjects will be prevented from drawing supplies from Iraq* As Kuwait is now closed to Afchwan owing to the Customs dispute this would be a heavy blow to Ibh saud* Regarding request for meeting, it has always been proposed that Feisal and Ibn saud shall meet on the first opportunity but I do not know how far H*M*Government would approve Feisal going to the Meeting mainly as representative of Hedjaz and Trans-Jordania* Feisal is much wrapped up in this project and it would be a great blow to him if it was discouraged* Moreover, there is the burning question between Nejd and Iraq of the return of Hejd shammar refugees, which now calls for early decision* I am inclined therefore to advise the proposed meeting be suggested to Ibn saud, such arrangements for the participation of Bushlre as may be necessary being made after consideration of Ibn Saud f s letter dealt with in my immediately following telegram (addressed to London and Bushire only)* With regard to the threat of cutting off Iraq supplies employment of this at present moment seems premature* I hope that instructions may be sent to me at an early date* Highcoma*Telegram P.

I showed him all recent telegrams from H.!t.Government and advised him to trust in the result of their messages to Ibn Saud, but while asking mo to express gratitude to H.n.Govt. for the attitude adopted, he maintained that if their intervention failed he would be forced to act* I hope that reflection may cool his excitement, but he is in constant (one group) comnunication with Abdullah and I cannot be sure of retaining control of him or of presenting him from sending secret instructions to our desert tribes, which might precipitate a collooion* I hope th^t I may receive early instructions regarding proposed meeting, which would enable me to prevent rash action on his part* The foregoing refers to my telegram No* 462 of the 24th August• HighcomaTelegram P* From - Colonial office.

Also report from Jerusalem in reply to my telegram No. 257 of 18th August. • Until it is established that Ibn Saud has declined to hold back his force, H.M.Govt. cannot agree to any action being taken, which may increase the difficulty of the situation. Nor do they welcome the prospect of Iraq intervention. If ibn Baud decides to attack Kaf, reliable information will no doubt reach Jerusalem in time for suitable action to be taken. With regard to proposed meeting between Feisal and ibn Saud, I am ! awaiting reply from Bushire to my telegram of August 27th, repeated to you as No* 383. If hostilities do not develope, advantage might be taken of this (two groups obscure) to clear up the question of Trans-Jordan and possibly Hedjaz frontier. Trans-4ordan and Hedjaz might both be represented. I see no reason why Feisal should represent Trans-Jordania, and it is unlikely that Hussein will agree to his representing Hedjaz, nor . do I think this desirable. This being so, I am not satisfied that the meeting between Feisal and Ibn saud would serve a useful purpose at this stage. The only outstanding point between Iraq and Nejd seems to be the question of Shammar refugees, which is apparently being aggravated by the unwise action reported in paras 592 to 594 of advanced intelligence Report No* 16. Your action in this matter is approved and you shduld adhereto the position taken up by you* H.lUGovt^ will readily take up this and similar questions with Ibn saud through the Resident at Bushire on Feisa^s behalf if you roconrmond this course* They strongly deprecate independent action by Feisai especially where Trans-Jordan is concerned, and confidently rejfly on him to (?) leave to them the decision of what course (?) should be taken* Th© above refers to your telegrams Nos* 462 (?) and 467* Devonshire*Telegram p.

I understand that the reasons why Abdullah with Philby 1 s acquiescence ashed Feisal to represent Trans-Jordania were, ( 1 ) That |one group mutilated) and political conditions make a meeting between Feisal and Ibn saud i easy, especially as^ such a meeting has long been contemplated# (2) Foisal’s relr.tionship and recent intimate discussions with Abdullah. (3) Feisal• s thorough knowledge of the whole of the Jauf locally and tribes, obtained during his operations against the Turks# It is, I think, natural that they should both feel that the Trans-Jordan case could be put forward with more force by Feisal than by anyone possessing loss personal knowledge of the factors involved. As to Hedjaz, I understand that Feisal has been in telegraphic communication with Hussein about possible negotiations by the former with Ibn Saud, but Hussein has not yet sent a final reply. I quite appreciate the possibility that ibn Saud might refuse to meet Feisal as representative of Trans-Jordania, and such refusal would do no ham. I fear however that if we refuse without very convincing reasons to allow the suggestion of a mooting to be put to Ibn Saud all sorts of motives will be read into our refusal by Feisal, who has set his heart on being allowed to try, and will become bitterly disappointed ^*,xoious and unfriendly at a moment when complete collaborationbetween him and myself here is essential for the purpose of getting through agreements subsidiary to the treaty# From my local point of view therefore I would urge H*M.Government to allow the suggestion of the meeting to be put to Ibn Saud without any show of desire for its acceptance# MiS5 Bell who has Just arrived » via‘(one group mutilated) tell me that Abdullah and Philby are definitely under the impression that the meeting (one group mutilated) in any case takes place, and that Trans-Jordan questions can be conveniently discussed there# The above refers to your telegram Wo* 380 of 20th August• Highcoma*(3 Prom - Colonial Office.

I propose to assume that the Sultan is restraining his force in consequence of the message conveyed in my telegram to you of August 17th. You should therefore, subject to comment within three days from Baghdad to Jerusalem, approach the Sultan as follows:- You should express gratification that he has restrained his force and propose to him that a meeting should be held at the earliest possible date to discuss the Nejd-Trans- Jordania boundary. You should suggest that opportunity might at the same time be taken of discussing outstanding questions with Iraq, notably the question of Shammar re fugees. If the Sultan wishes It, H.M•Government would be prepared to suggest to King Hussein that Nejd-Hedjaz quest ions should be simultaneously discussed,although the meeting might suitably take place under your auspices at Kuwait or Bahrain, if Nejd and Iraq territory are both unsuitable.You should enquire whether the Sultan would prefer to attend himself, in which case Felsal and Abdullah would naturally d attend in person, or whether he would prefer each party shouj ssfad a plenipotentiary. Argument for the latter course is that Hussein could not possibly come himself (one group mutilated) should give a distinct lead for a meeting for plenipotentiaries rather than of principals. The time does not appear to have arrived for holding language suggestedin your telegram of the 29th August 788, hut uill no doubt be able t o convey toot fully to the sultan that our pbjeet in suggesting the meeting is to put an end to a state of affairs which might result in a clash between Ibn Saud and H*M*Govt* You should inform him at the same- time that the captured mail bag is being handed to his representative at Damascus, and poini. out that it was taken during operations which followed the attack on .’vaf, of which he had hitherto disclaimed all knowledge* C PIT F1DKIIT IALa.

It seems unlikely that a reply to the com munication directed in your telegram of the 12 th September can be received from Ibn Saud before October 12th. All plenipotentiaries ^ill then have to be briefed and their attendance secured at the place of meeting. I estimate the 31st October as the earliest possible date for the commence ment of the negotiations, and we may consider ourselves extremely fortunate if they are completed by the end of the year, indeed as it must be expected that the plenipotent iaries in the usual fashion of oriental diplomatists will be no occasion for surprise if the negotiations drag on throughout the cold weather. Trevor arrives at Bushire on October 17th, and I leave on the 21st. It will therefore be imnossible for me as Political Resident to do more than prepare the ground; and immediately after his return, amid his many other offi cial preoccupations, my successor will have to take up the burden of iniating and concluding these negotiations, which besides being unconnected with Persian Gulf problems, cover a very wide field.

Khazal is willing and anxious to help but , as you will see from the papers, Minister, Tehran , by no means likes his being mixed up in -krab politics which he thinks cannot but increase the mistrust which the Persian Government a l read y feel towards Shaikh Khazal. How the matter will exactly end 1 do not know. It is possible that the Home authorities may intervene and say that as we have done so much for Shaikh Khazal it is only reasonable that he should come in to help us in an emergency . The last thing that Shaikh Khazal said before 1 left was 'Vt any rate you must let m e lend you the hosh.' I returned a non-committal and grateful reply and Shaikh Khazal must worry out with the Minister and Minister for War w hat part he is to be allowed to take in the business. 1 still stick to my preierence for Jabir's fort for myself' if Shaikh iihmad will oblige. We have persuaded our cook to remain and have decided to bring up a gas stove and cooking utensils for ourselves , also a few comfortable chairs for ourselves and the Conference and some lamps unless you countermand the latter.

Should Your Grace on reconsideration attach importance to a personal meeting of principals so strongly urged by the SheiJch of Mohammerah, as intimated in my telegram No.905Jc of the 16th Octobbr, which I understood also to receive the strong support of Baghdad vide Baghdad telegrams No.462 dated 25th August and No.320-S of 28th August, this would be arranged much later as the conference developes and should not present insuperable difficulties. I am now telegraphing to Bahrain a provisional letter acknowledging Bin Saud f s letter and inviting him to send a plenipotentiary, laying stress on the importance of full powers, to Kuwait by the 15th Nov. Instructions to Bahrain will make clear that this letter is not to be despatched pending receipt of Your Grace’s final sanction to the conference, regarding which I trust to receive early orders.

It should be kept strictly secret. The frontier of Trans-Jorda&amp;ia being the front- -ier of the mandated area of Palestine is the direct concern of H.M.Government. They are prepared to exclude the whole of Wadi Sarhan from Kaf inclusive, and to allow Hedjaz to extend Korthward along the railway as far as Madawwara, provided that rans-Jordania has access to the Gulf of Akaba, that Nejd does not encroach upon the Hedjaz railway, and that* Khurma and araba are included in Hedjaz. hey would accordingly see no objection to the frontier being drawn from the intersection of meridia 39 with parallel 32 to the intersection of meridian 37 with parallel 31?. lienee along meridian 37 to parallel 31. hence to the intersection of the meridian 38 with parallel 30. hence along meridian 38 to parallel 29 degrees 35 or point due West of Nefud ealient.

H.M.Government strongly deprecate delay in assembly proposed Conference* They regard with considerable misgiv ing announcement that officials have been despatched by Ibn Saud to examine and report on the border land. Though they are reluctant to believe such activities as those of Faisal Ibn Dawieh have authority or countenance of Sultan it appears to them that the despatch of special mission ofthis kind to neighbourhood of frontier at present stage will almost in- evitablly lead to local friction which may imperil prospect of permanent settlement. They have been at considerable pains to arrange the meeting which was cordially welcomed by Sultan in his letter reported by you in October. There are other indications that wishes of H.M.Government do not carry the weight with Ibn Saud that they have a right to expect in view of the friendly relations which have subsisted for so many years between the two Governments. It would be grave disappointment to them if of events were to impair or U A weaken these relations bsr they cannot acquiesce in the con- \ tinuance of the present state of uncertainty as to the frontiers of Nejd and sphere of activity ofits Ruler. They accordingly regret they are unable to concur in proposed poetponment of Conference^ Their representative will leave Bombay on 6 th November and will reach Kuwait during the first week of December. They trust that on his arrival he will find Sultan’s representative ready to commence negotiations and that H.M.Government will at the same time receive an assurance that Sultan has instructed his representatives in frontier districts to refrain from any aggressive or provocative action* in the event of the Ne.ld representativenot reaching Kuwait by the end of first week in December H*il«GrOVeminent will be reluctantly compelled to assume Sultan has decided to incur grave displeasure of H.M •Government.

He would almost certainly allege counter agression by Husimites c.nd this would lead to endless and fruitless controversy which would more proper take place at Conference itself. 1 do not understand exactly what assurances are desired against future aggression but, if Faisal means written promise oy Bin Saud, 1 should regard it as valueless until perhaps after conference. In regard to remaining points, 1 see no objection at present to their discussion at conference. 1 presume that Bin Saud’s stipulation that each delegate shall confine his attention to matters concerning territory of his principal has been accepted and that Faisal will instruct his representative to be c.-reful not to weigh in with suggestions regarding Hedjaz and Transjordan.

Should His Majesty’s Government so decide, ibn Sciud can easily be coerced; the instructions Faisal gives to his representative are his own affair but these constant suggestions for threats and impossible demands by His Majesty’s Government appear to me as reasonable as to expect a horse running wild to come in to you while you are continually cracking your whip at him . 1 am as fully alive as Iraq to the possibility that the conference may result in failure but there is plenty of time and I think this cold weather might be allowed to pass in an honest attempt to try what negotiation will do and the present policy should be patience conciliation and a determination on the part of Iraq not to do anything to render conference a failure. Their present attitude suggests the imputation that, because it has been decided that the conference will not proceed on the lines originally suggested by them, they are resolved to produce such a state of mind in Ibn S-oid as to render my task impossible.

No 51 Bated K8th BeceIubel• , 1C23,, The mr^tinc. of the Confcrexice held yesterday afternoon was extremely Interesting. Ibn Sa’ud's cyxwoya presented seren points which X shall telegriph when accurately translated an^u determined. They demand on Xhn Ba l ud , c behalf that 'Iraq shall expel all or ar^y of bio tribesmen who take refuse in *Iraq on the mere allegation TaI. they are a menace to the peace of the border. They specially mentioned trUae escaping from demands of tribute. 5 Iraq, not un naturally, meets this with a flat refusal,ninintainin&amp; that, not only is this unpresedented, contrary to international practice and tribal traditions of hos pitality, but it is outside practical politics in that these refuge* tribesmen settle near the Turco-’lraq frontier and an attempt to coerce them would merely result in their crossing into Turkish territory. The N&amp;Jd delegated reply that, unlea this be concede^ it is impossible to expect? peace on the frontier. She re uuekxxxxbx xaxngD' ju&amp;s. appears to be no prospect of agreement or even acceptance of mu* % Xraq*s civilized vl*w unless His Majesty*s Government are prepared to endorse it in the shape of authoritative advice or a declaration of policy, I have Just heard from Bullard, Jeddah, that there is no hope of w ijaz sending a deputation,This puts the Najd delegates in a strong position of which they are making great capital. Thzf I presume that nonenone the lees we must continue negoti&amp;tions. This morning a further question arose as to whether raiding can be declared -nd extraditable crime. The Nnjd delegates say that, if this be accorded, they will welcome an extradition treaty. The 'Iraq envoys on the oth«r hand maintain that such a declaration is impossible. An authoritative declaration of policy, or a we&amp;keninfc of ‘Iraq's attitude In this respect, would be welcome and appears to be the only solution.I ■' ■ &lt; . , • • 1 ) / sr IS&lt;j T#l#gram (P).

The proposal vaa wrecked, however, on the clause insisted upon by ‘Iraq that everyhing must depend upon a satiOfiactory agreement being reached bMteean Najd and Hljaz. ‘flie Najd envoys rejected this condition, and decline to put their signature to such a document, apparent ly thinking that it implies and recognizes a secret hostile alliance between ‘Iraq and Kijaz to the detriment of Najd. Utt&amp;Sr these circumstances, unless Hijaz ca^ be persuaded to send a delegation, I see no use in continuing the Con ference. This decision is regretted by both the Najd and ‘Iraq en voys, and they suggest the alternative of adjourning the Conference until IStfc January, which will allow the 'Iraq authorities on points raised in the course of tae discus sion, and to return to complete the agreement. It v/ill also allow the envoys of Najd to ask insXuctloiia from X their . rincipal on various poina.

In fact according to Faisal, hadinah is tottering to its fall, and, from what Bullard says, the inhabitants are ready to acquiesce, or at any rate not oppose.

There are abundant instances In iiistory of a country having to parley with the victorious foe who is In actual possession of conquered territory* Th«re are few more cogent reasons. Regarding {3) 1 agree but assuming that they will not go to the length of declaring open war, there appears to be no remidy other than to threaten to abandod Hijaz unless Ling Husain come to hia senses.

This Is scarcely a 'damaging admission*. ‘Abdullah on 86th August had gome some what further and stated that the ‘Iraq Government were determined to expel these Shammar should they again aggress against the tribes of Najd. Ibn Sa‘ud has clearly no right to demand the return of his tribes,and a compromise , which might otherwise have been conceivable is most unlikely so long as the present feeling about Hijaz exists. As regards the return of plunder, most of it has already been returned. The ‘Iraq delegates are In possfeMhon of the facts.

The question of the expulsion of tribesmen taking refuge in 'Iraq. The principal of expulsion cannot tee generally accepted as it would lead to complications on the other frontiers of ’Iraq where similar circumstance t exist with Turkey, Syria, and Persia, 2. Huestion of the prevention of raiding. It Is suggest ed that a special tribunal, consisting of tribal represent atives from both states,nominated by ’Iraq and accepted by Najd and vice vHrsa, and a third person nominated ad hoc for each claim by the claimant from the tribes of the defendant party, shall be periodically constituted to deal with the question of i^aids. decision of the majority to oe linal. On proof of raiding and damage fcustfcftncd- being given Beper* this tribunal and accented by it, the ’Iraq Government would enforce the restitution of property in accordance with tribal custom and would punish the offenders suitably. 3. Najd Shammar. The ’Iraq Government is prepared to give an official written undertaking that if the appli cation of the above-mentioned proceedure does not prevent the Shammar from raiding Into Najd territory, they will expel indlvual Shammar raiders from ’Iraq, but will not return them to Najd. 4. Extradition Treaty. Faisal Is of opinion that as Najd possesses no regularly constituted courts of justice it would be impossible to satisfy ’Iraq courts that there was a prima facie evidence of guilt against the accused individuals whose extradition Najd might desire, Najd us. an extradition treaty as an en t lntof oppressionoppresflion to secure the forcible return from ’Iraq of politick, refugees. Faisal therefore Is In favour of dropping the whole question of extradition. 6. Plunder taking after the ’Uqair Conference. If Sir Percy Cox did promise the Sultan of Najd that claims previous to the Conference would be cancelled # the Government of ’Iraq will abide by his promise and ptimder arrange for the restoration of taken since, most A of which has already been restored. If on the other hand Sir Percy did not make any such promise, Faisal wishes the date of his coronation to be taken as the starting joint for the mutual restitution of plunder. 6. Ibn kijlad. If he and his tribe wish to belong to Ibn Ga’ud, they must go to Najd and not return to 1 Iraq. Faisal Is prepared to give bublh Bey revised instructions on the above lines and will conoant under protest that the settlement of outstanding differences between ’Iraq and Najd shall not depend on a Najd~Hijaz settlement.No. //• of 1925.

I am afraid that,unless principle of extradition of individual raiders is accepted and less stress placed cn tribal hospitality by Iraq, there will be continued discontent and friction with Arab rulers such as Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah and Ibn Sa’ud. I would suggest that first steps in civilization demand : (a) breaJi up of ouch tribal hospitable cuetomo which only lead to friction and (b) cooperation among rulers to coerce unruly refugee It is too early yet to allow the lack of regularly constituted courts of justice to obstruct punishment of unruly tribesmen though I agree with Faisal’s point of view in para four as regards ordinary criminals and endorse proposal to drop ordinary extradition treaty. regards two I trust it may te possible to secure consent of Nejd and, if so, three seems satisfactory; so also is five.

A message £rom the correspondent of 'The Times M at Jerusalem, dated the 9th January and published in London on the iith, indicates that the occasion of the visit of King Husain to ’Amaan may be taken to raise the question of hia claim to the Arabic Caliphate of Islam, Doubtless you are aware that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards this subject is that the question of the Caliphate is one which affects Muslims alone,and that Great Britain has no wish or intention to Interfere in it in any way whatsoever. You should strictly adhere to this attitude if the question is raisedT«l*£rftia (P). Prom A-nox, ?^uwalt» Highcoraa, Baghdad; relocated to London. No. 48. Bated i&amp;th January i924.

Reference correspondence ending with your telegram 25. In view of King Faisal’s arguments I am inclined to ^gres that. It 18 impossible to consider raiding as an extradit able crime, and to share the view that the Government of •Iraq cannot be expected to refuse sanctuary to refugees from Najd or to hand them over to Ibn Sa'ud at his request, On the other hand I see no reason why Iraq should con tinue to harbour Najd refugees «£ abuse the hospitality of * Iraq by using the country as a base from which to raid' the Ikliwan. After full consideration of the con flicting views expressed in recent telegr;uas from your self and Knox it occurs to me that the following solution of the probleto might produce the desired results,namely peace on the border. Najd tribes wishing to enter ’Iraq should only be allowed to do so on their giving a sub stantial guarantee in money or cattle that they will abstain from raiding. The Shamnar and other Najd tribes who have already established themselves in ’Iraq should also be called upon under pain of expulsion to give similar guarantees. These guarantees would be liable to confiscation in the event of raids talcing place ana If they were sufficiently substantial (namely more than they could hope to obtain from a successful raid) they would probably deter the tribes from raiding. There appears to be no reason why the above proceedure,which would of course be reciprocal, should not be used in conjunction with a tribal tribunal such as suggested in the aecong paragraph of your telegram No 4 of 3rd Jan. If Faleal concur In tnis proposal I hope that Subih Bey■ Subeh Bey will be given inatructions to put this forward whWi he returns to Kuwait.L Telegraa (?)• 9 From.

Major Holmes whom I saw on the 9th told me that Ibn Sa*ud had told him he Intended to claim right up to Syrian terrltoiy north of Jabal f Anlzah, thus cutting off Palestine from ’Iraq and complicating the questions of the railway and pipe line. It will he 4 remembered that in 1921 the French were suspected of trying to put difficulties in the way of the trana-desert railway scheme by encouraging Ibn Sa*ud to encroach towards the north and their own tribes towards the south. Doubtless you*fully realise the cogent reasons for maintaining a broad strip of territory across the desert under direct British influence, but I think it desirable to repeat Holmes’ / • \ statement as he was so definite.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000010_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/69</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000010</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/69</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'22/23 I Kuwait Conference 1923'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1923/1924</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-07-19T22:12:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (250 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 250; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
