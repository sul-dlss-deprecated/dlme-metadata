On or about the 4th Ha jab 1355 (20.9.36) he left by his camel in company with ohara* oin rlazaia, his friend, who was also r idixig a camel. He intended to see Lafi al Shamali who was camping at Batiyah in order to take his goats which he had kept with him. On his ?/ay he was seen by some 5 or 6 motor cars belonging to Iraq Government who arrested them and took their camels on the ground that they were smugglers. They told them (Iraq officials) that they would have adopted a different manner if they were smugglers but they beat him (Muhammad) severely when they could not discover anything on him and told him to give them the names of the smugglers, /hen he told them that he did not know any smugglers they took him and his friend by car to Zubair where they were handed over to the Mudir at Zubair who imprisoned them for 12 days. Thereafter he was sent to Basrah where he was imprisoned for 33 days. But his friend was released-after remaining one month in prison at Zubair. The articles which were taken from Muhammad al Nasir were one red she-camel, saddle, one sheep skin, one Mabraka, one Nata 1 (a piece of leather) one 11 shot rifle, one bandolier containing 85 cartridges, one binocular, one water skin, one red shawl and 3 pieces of white cloth costing Rs.4/12/-. Shara*s articles were one he-camel, one saddle, one travelling bag, one piece of leather,one safifah (belt) one waqiyah of coffee and Bs.18/8/.

Ku¥j'ait'lracL frontier Incidents. Sir, I iiave tiie hprfaur to refer to correspondence ending with, my telegram. JTo.Sl dated Stti Jetruary 1937 and to say that the investigation liy tiae Iraq.i Police into their incursions is now completed. Meetings took place on the 18th January at Safwan, on the 31st at Atu Jifran in Kuwait 1 territory, on tiie 4t]i February at Zubeir, on the 5tli at Basra and on the 7th at al AnaqL in Kuwait territory. I give 'below a summary of each case from which it will 'be seen that five were proved and in the three the witnesses were absent in other countries owing to the migratory season, as was pointed out might 'be the case in Resident's letter E'o.827-S of 8th November 1936 to Ambassador. ' ' / *U 0 As you are aware Major Sargon, the British Inspector of the fourth Iraq. Police Area, was charged with the investigation and the tragi Coimaandant of Ba s ra pjid I were associated with him. ¥ith some reluctance it seemed I was associated with the investigation. Reviewing our work it is difficult to see how the investigation could have 'been carried out if I, or some responsible person from Kuwait had not 'been associated, n-nri i /-6'yjrf /6(r (, 7~9 1a. doubt if the. atmosphere would, have remained cordial if the Political Agent had not 'been there. 3. The Iraqi Commandant repeatedly admitted that he understood very little of what the Bedouin witnesses said and in spite of this took upon himself a role resembling that of a tricky defending solicitor^ A particular success of his was to ask the witnesses to describe the Police uniform. They are it appears unahle to do so. They just said H the Police were dressed like Police' or 'in coat and trousers M which was always a. triumph for the Commandant. The Bedouins held to their stories and maintained their dignity in most cases. One did not. Luckily the Commandant failed to understand the meaning of the ahuse and the threat to make him. M as emasculated as he looked M , if he was seen over the frontier again. (Not that he himself had ever crossed it without leave). He recoiled from the vehemence of the man, until I stopped it. 4.. After the first, meeting^t-^afwan a newspaper article appeared in the Basparliewspaper 'An. Fas' (copy forwarded to the Hon'j^e the Political Resident under Printed Letter No.G-49--c5f 2nd Pehruary 1937) which quoted with approvSall the Commandant # s reference to the impossibility of cars moving in Kuwait territory owing to the sandy soil^which article it would seem must have heen contributed by himself. At the last meetings he repeatedly enquired quite irrelevantly as to the whereabouts of A1 Matlah which he said was the proper frontier of Kuwait so he was credibly informed by an old friend of his.* (Al Matlah is the cliff just north of Al Jahara, 25 miles from Kuwait, at the v/estern extrimity of the Kuwait Bay). I failed to rise to his bait, if such it was. 5. further description of the attitude of this rather tiresome man would be tedious and I have only briefly touched upon it to make clear to you the atmosphere of the meeting wxiich on the whole was cordial in spite of it. He3. ^ ^ may perhaps 'be exciisei as iie was iefending his service, the Irajii Police. It was olDviously in his minil a matcii of IraqjL versus Kuwaiti and of torn versus country, that the Coimnanaant was attending - rather than an impartial investigation. 6. I need hardly add that Major Sargon's attitude was wholly correct.

The Iraqi Sergeant stated that the men were smugglers and that he had encountered them at Q^aqaiyah and pursued them. Qaqaiyah itself, however, is in Kuwait territory 'but not far. The Frontier is not demarcated and the Irac[i Police Sergeant might easily have 'been in doubt aoout the whereabouts of the Frontier. When going to Qaqiyah from Qashaniya a well marked oar track, running east and ;:est , was passed. The Assistant Commandant of Police, Safwan, admitted thau his oars used and made this track, which is in Kuwait territory. a road exists North of the Frontier connecting Safwan and TJmm Qasr which could equally well 'be used by thethe- Iraq. Police. Ca se Ho.7. The witness it is regretted could not 'be produced 'being absent on a voyage. Case Ho,8. Proved with counter allegation. Pour witnesses examined separately on the scene categorically affirmed that the incident took place at Hissu adh Dhahi on or about the 14th November. The Iraqi Police record sho\is that on 18th November 13 camels were taken from some men who ran away near Jahal Sansm. They also say witnesses were endeavouring to implicate Marzoog 'bin Lahem, the Iraqi Police Secret Informer (formerly a smuggler) when all the witnesses said they saw at Hissu adh Dhaoi. Detail of evidence in this case follows 'below. Sa'ad 'bin Sallh stated that he and his 'brother had 19 camels loaded with goods which they were taking for their om and their friends • consumption. On arrival at Hissu adh Dhahi one car of Iraq.. Police came upon them and told them that they were smugglers. Marzoog 'bin Lahem was in the car. The incident happened ahout sunset. Out of fear they lan away leaving their camels and goods. Karwi 'bin Dhari stated that he accompanied 'by two of his friends left Kuwait and while they were staying at Hissu adh Dhahi an Iraq Police car came upon them and asked them whether they knew anything aoout the smugglers. -J (witness) told them that he had nothing to do with the smugglers and that he was going to see his people. There were seven men including the driver in the car. Marzoog Din Lahem aTiri Jed'an were among them. They had oadges on uheii white dress. They asked him to accompany them in oider to load the camels whose loads were lying on the ground. j.±iere were 19 camels in all. He and his two friends loaded the 13 camels and put the loads of the other six ®amels in the car. The Police then released the six camels and took 13 camels with their loads northwards. The incident took place in the month of Hamadhan aoout sunset.5 Sv AMullah 'bin Haji stated that while he and his friends were staying at Hissu adh Dha'bi an Iraa Police car came upon them and asked alDOut the smugglers. Including the driver there were 7 men in the car and Marzoog 'bin Lahem and Jed*an were among them. They were wearing white dress. They asked him to accompany them in order to load the camels whose loads were lying on the ground and was forced hy them to load the camels as he was not willing to do so. He did not know the number of the owners of the camels as they had gone away.They released six camels after putting their loads in the car and took 13 camels with their loads with them. companions were camping at Hissu adh Dhabi. An Iraa Police car came upon them and asked about the smugglers and then threatened them to go ¥/ith them and put on the camels their loads which were lying on the ground. There were in the car six or seven men who were wearing white dress .They loaded 13 camels and put the loads of six camels in the car. Some of the occupants of the car came down and drove the camels. He did not see the owners of the camels as they had gone away. The witnesses were taken to the scene of the incident. Salih pointed out the place to the Iraa delegates and said that as far as he remembered Jed •an was a tall lean man. Marwi also pointed out his halting place and stated that the car was not armed and that he saw Marzoog bin Lahem. Abdullah bin Naji shov/ed the place to the party and stated that the car was a small uncovered one and that he knew Marzoog. Ghazi pointed out his halting place to the Iraa delegates and said that the car was a small uncovered one. He did not see Marzoog.

I have also seen one of his sailors AMullak 'bin Yusiif of the Bin Kusf quarter of Kuwait and examlnecL him separately. His story supports that of the report and the ii'*'i 'ii i m l f '• mmer.

They were he says constantly 'being cursed and knocked ahout as long as they remained on the 'boat. They had a little food of their own to eat and nothing was given them 'by the Oustoms Police. K letter to Zubair from the Gustoms Police was he says taken 'by ♦'the car of al Asaimi' which seems to 'be a postal contract car and the reply, which apparently authorized their release, came to the land ^ m titt -r ■ - , opposite the Customs 'boat hy hand, of a Bedouin. 4. I have also seen Jasim 'bin Muhammad of the Hilal quarter of Kuwait, owner of the Shu'i sailing 'boat mentioned in paragraph (c) of the Sheikh's letter and two of his men and examined them separately. They confirm the report. Jasim says that when the 'black Tao launch with men in uniform came up with them they were sheltering in the north end of Khor Tha^alih and against its western shore. (Khor Tha'alib is the channel at the western end of ¥ar'ba Island, connecting the Khor Zubair and the Khor Subiya). He was therefore south of the junction of the Ehor Abdullah and the Khor 'Zubeir and in Kuwait waters, as was the launch. 5. Ahmad bin Muhammad Bu Eisli one of the crew of the al Iluwaddhaf quarter of Kuwait confirms that they were sheltering in the Khor Tha f alib when about 8 p.m. the black Eao Customs Police launch came up to them, having presumably seen their light. He confirms that the Police told them they had no right in that place and if they came again they would confiscate their boat and imprison them.3. j3 6. Hasan iDixi MaxmaM of the Hilal quarter of Kuwait also one of the crew, confirriis the account and that they were sheltering in the Khor al Thalalih when the ■black- Customs launch from ^ao came up v/ith them at night and threatenedL them and. warned them not to come for prawn fishing in that place again and if they did they would he imprisoned. 7 m The witnesses in case ('b) were not available this week 'being absent on a voyage. X suggest that the Oustoms Police at i'ao 'be warned that Khor Tha'alib and the Bay of Bahaith are in Kuwait.

Els Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After Gompliments, (a) I 'beg to state that on or aoout the 22M. Shawal last (5/1/37) a small jolly-ho at with two men on hoard proceeded from KuwaiTto Khor al Bahaith, north of Suhiya for the purpose of collecting firewood. On their arrival there they saw a Boom anchoring opposite Umm Qasr. T lhen they were not far from, the Boom, the Kakhuda of the Boom and four policemen disembarked in a jolly-'boat. Cne policeman was landed ashore on the western side and the three other policemen and the Hakhuda proceeded in the jolly-hoat towards the eastern side. Ihen they (Iraqi men) came opposite them (Kuwaitis) the policeman who was on the western side fired a shot in the air towards them and shouted to them to lower their sail which was up. On lowering their sail the three policemen and the Nakhuda went to them and took them with their jolly-'boat to the Boom, wjaere they were ordered to remove the sail, rudder and oars of their jolly-hoat and keep them in the Boom. Thereafter they told them that they were smugglers and that they should inform them ahout their goods. They told them that they were poor people and knew nothing ahout such 'business 'but they started heating the crew of the jolly-hoat and kept him naked at night. Though a strong Shamal was 'blowing and the weather was very cold they wanted to put him in water. The crew was crying and hegging them to treat him with mercy and when he was ahout to get into the water that the Nakhuda of the Boom saved him. Besides this one of the policemen named Yasin heat him with a stick and slapped him in order that he may he compelled to say that they were smugglers. 'When they (Iraqi policemen) ascertained that they (Kuwaitis) were poor firewood collectors they sent a report 'by car to Zuhair and on the 4th Bhil Qadeh (17/1/37) when the reply was received from Zuhair the Kuwaitis were released. The namesnames of the policemen, as given 'by the Kuwaitis are as follows: ■ All HaicLar, Kadhem, Tasin, Ej'az and the NaMiuda. ('b) At the same time they (Iraqi Police) saw a small S]iu , i whicli iiad gone for firewood. Tliey seized the Shu'i and detained the crew with those of the jolly-'boat in the Boom. They were released on receipt of orders from Zubeir with strict warnings that they should not land again ashore for collecting firewood. The crew of the jolly-hoat were: 'uhammad 'bin ihdullah ShahalD (Nakhuda) Abdullah 'bin Yusuf (crew who was he at en) The crew of the Shu*! were: Othman 'bin Yusuf (Hakhuda) ill 'bin Othman (crew) '.Mullah 'bin ' 'uhammad (crew). These people are poor and do not Imow anything ahout smuggling. (c) Ahout 5 days ago the motor launch of IP&amp;o saw the prawn catchers who were sheltering on the western side as a strong South wind was 'blowing. Since many years those who catch prawn enter Khor Suhiya for the purpose of catching prawns. HaMiuda Jasim 'bin Muhammad told the launch people that they were prawn catchers and had taken shelter o./ing to the wind 'but the launch men told them that their limit was from Khor Warba and southwards and that they have no permission to visit that place. The launch man slapped the Nakhuda of the Shu*i when he said that they had 'been catching place prawns at the same/kirns: since many years. He ordered them to gc and not to return to that place as it vtas not their country and told them that they would he imprisoned and their 'boat detained if they return to that place again. blames of the prawn catchers were: Jasim 'bin Muhammad (Nakhuda) Ahmad Bu Hisli (crew) Hasan al Manna 1 i M Ahdul Aziz al Dooh ' Mehdi »5, A I would 'be grateful if you would kindly prevent these annoying aggressions which are not expected from my neighbour the twin country of Iraq..

The earlier history of this question is contained in correspondence leading up to hqt Sxpress Letter No, 354-3, dated the 30th April 1935, in which the facts of the situation were sumnarised. 2# The present position is that the Shaikh of Kuwait has indicated his willingness to make an anti-smuggling agreement with Iraq but that before discussing it he desires to conclude the Kuwait - Saudi Agreement (India Office telegram Ho,425, dated the 6th February 1937 to the Political Resident, copy by air to Government of India). 3. In the meantime recent Iraqi incursions into Kuwait territory have been investigated by a Joint Gonmittee composed of an Iraqi Police Official and the Political Agent, Kuwait, representing the Shaikh. The atmosphere was cordial (my Printed letter No.iOl-S of the 21st January 1937), and it is hoped that this will lead to the establishment of a permanent Jprontier Committee. 4. The Kuwait - Saudi negotiations will either be brought to a successful conclusion or fall through in a short time, when tlie Kuwait - Iraq discussions will be renewed. It is possible that the Kuwaiti proposals will not meet the demands of the Saudi Government, in which case His Majesty's Government may again wish to bring pressure to bear on the Shaikh to concede arrange ments acceptable to the Iraq Government. Should this situation arise I should be grateful for the support of the /-2- 7$ the Government of India against the bringing of pressure to bear on the Shaikh.

I have refrained from, saying so since it is a difficult thing to prove, but now I bring to your notice some facts which you may think relevant* 2. When Naji al Asil, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, was here I ventured to suggest that in addition to 'maintaining vigilance' on the frontier (his phrase) there should also be increased enquiry and Police activity in the ♦back areas' e.g. Basra, Suq. ash Sheukh etc, since most of the smuggling was conducted at the order of Iraqi merchants by Iraqi tribes. Sargon recently mentioned it as a fact to Hugh Montgomery that most of the smuggling was conducted from Iraq, and he told me only a few days ago that he had pointed out the need for action on the lines mentioned above to Iraqi Police Officers but without their taking any action. 5. Again he told me in confidence on 6th February that he had actually given the numbers of the motor cars and the names of Iraqi drivers and persons engaged in removing goods from dumps formed in Iraqi territory by Iraqi smugglers, to his Police Officers. They take no action on his information, he said. 4. Another point is that when Naji al Asil was here he mentioned ana showed that he was aware of that rather The Hobble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRS.2 — L 1 7 V rather extraordinary line in smuggling, the smuggling into Iraqo of Iraqi cigarettes# (See (e) and (f) of Colonel _— w —_ x ^ad I cannot see if Iraq is genuinely anxious to stop this traffic why she does not impose an export tax on cigarettes at least on those exported to Kuwait, which place could have no reason for complaint, ?• It seems to me that there are grounds for believing that Iraq, other than by imposing on the frontier a Customs Police force is making little effort to bring the smuggling, which arises out of her oim extremely high tariffs, to an end.53/83 G.T.C.

This advice included the suggestions that the export of Iraqi cigarettes to Kuwait untaxed should be stopped^and that the optive system of destining goods, ttiat is for landii^ alternatively at Kuwait or Basra as elected by the merchant to whom they are consigned, should be stopped. In no case, Edmonds said, was any action taken on his advice. -^t really does seem as if there are gro una s 1 or thinking that the former Iraqi Government was he Hon*ble Lt.-Colonel T.G.]?owle,G.B,S», Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE. 1- 2 - ii was except by having a few cars on the Kuwait frontier, taking no action against smuggling and really not at all anxious to see it stopped. 3, I can only think that their motives were to have a stick with which to heat Kuwait, and an excuse for postponing the date garden settlement. They could also thus stress the iniquity of the Shaikh of Kuwait and the need for Kuwait to come under Iraqi control. At the same time there would no doubt be certain financial advantages to them personally from the interested groups of merchants in Iraq. 4. I suggest that the present Iraqi Government have inherited the policy of their predecessor but may be without their improper intentions and that therefore their attention should be drawn to the direction in which they can cooperate to stop smuggling by (a) Imposing an export tax on Iraqi cigarettes to Kuwait; (b) Objecting to the optive system of consigning cargo; (c) Greater Police vigilance in the 'back areas'. To these suggestions Majors Edmonds and Sargon may, I think, be able to add others. ' H.^ . . .

I 'beg to inform you that two men of Kuwait namely Ibrahim bin Hamad and Abdul Aziz bin Abduls al Bannaq took some goods consisting of 5 bags of Sugar of li- cwts, 3 bags of matches of star mark, 2 bundles cigarette papers, 1/3 of a bag soft sugar and one gross of matches on their two camels to the interior for sale to the Bedouins of the desert. While they were at Jarfan on Saturday the S3rd Dhil Hejjeh 1355 (5/3/37) two Police cars of the Safwan Post came upon them at about 11-30 Arabic (5-30 p.m.), captured their canBls, put their loads in the cars and tten called the owners of the camels to take charge of their camels. The camelmen replied that they would do so after their departure. They {Iraq Police) took the goods and left the camels . I would be grateful if you would kindly give the question of these cars and their constant oacroach- ment on the frontier yourfavourable consideration. U.S.qq ( HDrahiin TdIii Hamad resident of Jahra states that on Thursday the 21st Dhil Hejjeh (4/3/37) lie and his friend AMul Aziz 'bin AMullah purchased some goods at Kuwait and returned the same day to Jahrah. On Friday morning (5/3/37) they left Jaiirah for the interior with their goods in order to sell them to the Bedouins of the desert. On Saturday the 6/3/37 at ahout 11-30 Arabic (5.30 p.m.) while they were halting at Jarfan to tak:e their food two IraqL Police cars of Safwan came from the western direction to Jarfan and threatening them with their rifles told them to leave their camels and goods. As soon as they left their things the Iraqi Police put the goods in the cars and then told them to go and look after their camels. The cars went towards the North. They could make out that the occupants of the cars were Iraqi Police as they were armed and dressed in the usual Iraqi Police unfform. The goods which were taken 'by the Iraqi Police were as follows: - 86 gross matches Ils.93/- 2 packets cigarette papers H 50A 5 'bags sugar * 55/- 1/3 of a hag sugar ^ 2/12 Bs.200/12Confident lal.

The Iraqi authorities at Basrah could of course easily stop tnis but prefer - for reasons best jfecncwn to tneaiselves - to take no action, their Proclamation Mo,1437 of 25rd July 1955 (vide your despatch Mo,483, dated the 30th July 1935 to the foreign Office) merely prohibited tne payment of drawback . of customs duty on imported articles exported from Iraq to of the fourth Iraq Police area) told him only a few days ago that he (Sargon) had pointed out to Iraqi police officers tne need for increased activity on t heir part in the 1 back areas 1 1 Basra, f-uq ash Sheufch etc#, where the organisers of the trade worked, but that these officcars h&amp;i taken no action, he also told de Gaury on the 6th February that he had actually given Kuwait. Aoain, de Saury reported tiiat liar^oa ( uxie Inspector to / * Excellency Sir Archibald Glark Kerr, ICCMCJ#, His ilaj esty's Ambassador, Bagdadto hie police officers the nyrabera of tne motor cars and tiae naaies of Iraqi drivers and persons, er^aged in remoTlng goods from damps found in Iraqi territory by Iraqi smugglers, but timt the police imd done nothing on this report, or on otners that he had sent in* j i.io 4« Idmonds, Chief Adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, when at Kuwait at tne end of January, informed de ! aury that he had three years a^o given the Iraqi Government written advice on how they theme elves could help to stop the smuggling from Kuwait. this advice, he said, included the suggestions that the export of Iraqi cigarettes to Kuwait untaxed should fee stopped, snd that the optive system of manifesting go ds for discharge either at Basrah or at Kuwait should also cease. de $aury understood from J2dmonds that his Ediaond # s - advice was not taken. | - H Both Sargon 1 s and Mmond ? s statements to de Oaury were informal and cannot therefore of course be quoted to the Iraqi Government * 6. .'hat all this comes to is that while on tne one hand the Iraqi Government are continually complaining to His Majesty's Gov em me nt now much they suffer from smuggling from Kuwait, on the other they refuse to take measures well within their power to check this smuggling.

KUWAIT - IRAQ RBLATIOHS. Paragraph 2 of India Office telegram Ho#880 to Political Resident does not quite represent view I put forward. I fear that it would be of no value to inform Iraq Government of nature of settlement now being negotiated between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and to refrain at the same time frcm any suggestion that His Majesty's Government will move Shaikh to conclude similar agreement with Iraq when smuggling agreement with Saudi Arabia is in working order. All the more so because there now seems little prospect of early settlement with Saudis. Bare assurance that Shaikh is ready to negotiate anti-smuggling arrangements with Iraq, after agreement with Saudi Arabia, will make no appeal to Iraqis. Having regard to differences between Kuwait-Saudi and Kuwait-Iraqi problems, my original proposal for submission of Kuwait-Saudi draft to Iraq Govermient was made mainly in the hope that it would be taken as an immediate earnest of our goodwill and afford a means of setting on foot discussions for comprehensive settlement so much to be desired. When I made it there seemed to be more than a good chance of achieving this.

Firstly, there is the general reluctance of the Iraqis to do much to settle Koweiti questions so long as smuggling continues, a point which I need not labour here.

The fishermen who spoke the truth when they were asked about their catch were ordered to give l/5 of their catch. They replied that they were Kuwaitis, that they were fishing at sea and that it has not been the custom to give anything. The motor boat people said that the contractor and the Iraqi Police were on board and that they rust give l/5of their catch. They (motor boat men) actually pointed out their rifles to tiae fishermen and chased the boats which sailed and forced them to anchor. They abused the fisher ...en, counted their fish and took l/5 of it by force. The fishermen have unjustly been treated as they have always caught fish in the same place and never paid anything.

(Note: The above proposals in fact confirm the exist ing practical interpretation. There is on the Subair-Kuwait road about one mile south of safwan a board marking the point where the road crosses the frontier). 2. fe should also invite the Shaikh of Kuwait to agree that the demarcation shall be carried out on the same lines as those suggested for the demarcation of the Saudiya frontier, i.e. a)- 2 - a) Completion of the network of trlangulatlon along the frontier zone, where the trlangulatlon la defective.

This depends on whether my proposals for the Saudi demarcation go forward, in which case the available Iraqi technicians will be fully occupied, and on whether in this case the British authorities, on behalf of Kuwait, can assist by undertaking the necessary prelimin ary triangulation.

Moreover, in view of the uncertainty which exists as to the exact position of the frontier in the neighbourhood of the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah and Khor Subiya, it seems doubtful whether even a joint examination of the witnesses could establish positively whether Muhammad bin The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard G.¥.

As you will have gathered from my letter No. 280/6/37 of May 29th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs w_rote to me on May 26th informing me of the result of the enquiries which had been made concerning them, and your news that the Mutasarrif of Basra had asked for the witnesses therefore came as a surprise. The explanation may be that the Mutasarrif grew impatient of waiting for the witnesses and sent in his report without hearing their story. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has so far made no reply to my representations on the subject of the incident referred to in your letter No. 318-S of M arch 27th, but the Koweitis concerned seem so clearly to have been on a smuggling expedition that it is impossible to insist that they should be regarded as innocent and law-abiding merchants. As tie Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel T. C.W. Powle, KCIE, CBE, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E,l \y&gt; Z ' 3 As regards the general observations in your letters Nos. 3^2-S and 364-S of May 21st concerning the association of the Political Agent, Koweit in the enquiries made 'by the Iraqi Government into these and other frontier incidents, it is difficult for me to give you satisfactory assurances, Lf I have more than once pressed the Iraqi Govern ment to adopt this procedure but they persistently evade me. They are irritated that smuggling con tinues unabated and it appears to them onesided and unfair that His Majesty^ Government should use their special position to take up every frontier incident on behalf of Koweit while disclaiming all responsi bility for smuggling, even when appealed to, to help suppress this nuisance. Superficially a joint enquiry into frontier incidents sounds evenhanded enough. Actually, seen from the Iraqi standpoint, it often means putting smugglers and the Iraqi police on the same footing. Prom the strictly juridical standpoint it is of course wrong for men of the Iraqi preventive services to cross the Koweiti frontier, but it cannot be expected that them - 3 - the Iraqi Government should look upon incidents of this kind as though they had no relation whatever to the question of smuggling. I think we must admit that to be fair, cooperation should aim at stopping all crimes and disorders on the frontier and, if the Koweitis would cooperate to suppress smuggling, I think there would be little difficulty in persuading the Iraqis to agree to joint action in other matters* But to press them to deal in this manner with the incidents which annoy the Shaikh, while the Shaikh does nothing to deal with the things which cause them much bother and expense, seems to them to be very unfair. I shall take up with the Minister for Foreign ^ X . Affairs the affair Referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 [ | mnI,,,,,111,, of your letter No. 364-S of May 21st, but for the reasons which I have tried to explain above, I do not feel able to press him to invite the Political Agent, Koweit to be associated in an enquiry concern ing it. I am, moreover, somewhat doubtful whether this is in itself a matter of enough importance to warrant a joint enquiry and whether, in the absence ofllf-0 - 4 - of frontier markings in the waters dividing Kov/eiti and Iraqi country, such an enquiry could produce positive results. ^ i ^ I shall write to you separately on the Sargon - de Gaury enquiry, I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel and Stewart. 5-vVT.

My dear Charge d^Affaires, I have the honour to inform you that on the 15th July, 1937, the Iraqi police charged with the patrolling of the Iraqi-Koweiti frontier and the control of smuggling in the Busayah district came across two Bedouins, in the Ahu G-har lands, with two camels laden with smuggled goods from Koweit, which included two rifles, some 2500 rounds of ammunition, and a quantity of percussion caps together with cartridge filling tools. The police arrested the two men and confiscated the smuggled goods. 2. In bringing the incident to your notice, I wish to point out that while in Koweit in November last, on his way to Riyadh, my predecessor, His Excellency Dr. Naji al Asil, discussed with the Shaikh of Koweit and the Political Resident the means of finding a remedy for the smuggling problem. In the course of these discussions. His Highness the Shaikh was so good as to declare that he had issued an order definitely forbidding natives of Koweit to engage in the smuggling of arms into Iraq.

No. 318-S of March 27th to the Ambassador, Sir Trenchard Powle informed us of a further alleged violation of Koweiti territory by the Iraqi police, and suggested that the Iraqi Government might be asked to associate the Political Agent, Koweit, with the enquiries to be made into this incident. Sir Archibald told Sir Trenchard in his letter No. 280/4/37 of April 29th that he was doing his best to get the Iraqis to agree to this. In a later letter on the subject, however, (the reference number is |v I 280/9/37'of June 15th), he said that he had not yet received any reply to his representations, and he pointed out that our hands were rather tied by the fact that the Koweitis concerned were so clearly engaged on a smuggling expedition.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their compli ments to His Britannic Majesty^ Embassy, Bagdad, and, with ^ Web reference to His Excellency the Ambassador's letter Nol 163 dated 3rd April, 1937, addressed to His Excellency Dr. Naji al Asil, the Former Foreign Minister, have the honour to state that investigations undertaken by the appropriate Iraqi authorities into the incident referred to in the enclosure to the said letter, reveal that the facts are as follows On the 6th March, 1937, while on patrol for the interception of smugglers in the locality called Al Hadamah within Iraqi territory, at a distance of 15 kilometres from the Iraq-Koweit firontier, the Iraqi police came across a camel caravan. Upon being called upon to halt, the men in charge of the caravan took flight, leaving behind them 5 camels laden with goods which they were in the course of smuggling, consisting of 15 bags of sugar, 5 bags of 'qand' (a kind of sugar), 4 packages of matches and one package of cigarette paper. The police were unable to arrest or identify the smugglers. The statement made by two Koweitis that they were bringing the goods for sale in the desert is a pure fabri cation, by which they intend to evade responsibility and make an attempt to recover the smuggled goods. At the same time, it may be noted that none of those claiming the goods has applied to the Iraqi authorities, notwithstanding the request addressed to the British Agent, Koweit, on more than one occasion, by the Mutasarrif of Basra Liwa, Prom the foregoing it will be plain to the esteemed Embassy that the Iraqi police had not crossed over the fron tier line in the course of discharging their duties, and that thethe incident occurred within Irac[i territory, where the seizure of the goods also took place.

My dear Charge d f Affaires, ^ I wish to refer to letter No.322 dated 22nd June, 1937, addressed by His Excellency the Ambassador of His Britannic Majesty to His Excellency the former Foreign Minister, regard ing aggression on Koweiti fishermen, and to state that the following are the result of the enquiries made into the incident by the appropriate Iraqi authorities: On the 26th April, 1937, the Fish Tax Farmer, accompanied by two policemen, put out from the Fao post in a small motor launch for the purpose of collecting the fish tax. At a place ^ called 'A1 Kamuri', within the frontiers of Iraq., the party came across a mixed group of Iraqi, Iranian and Koweiti fishermen. After collecting the legal tax from the latter, the Tax Farmer and the two policemen accompanying him returned to the place from whbh they had put out. Enquiries show that the small motor launch in which the Fish Tax Farmer and the two policemen had put out is incapable of navigating the Khor Kaid, because it is liable to founder at the feeblest gust of wind. Moreover, the owners of the launch are ignorant of the course to be followed in navigating the Khor. From the foregoing it will be evident to you that the launch had not entered Koweiti waters, and that the allegations of the fishermen were made only with the object of evading payment of the tax due from them, to the detriment of the rights of both the Tax Farmer and the Iraqi Treasury. I avail myself of this opportunity to express my highest consideration and esteem. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Abbas Mahdi. is Honour Mr. Oswald A.

KHULLAH RAID. Violation of frontier by armed forces, followed by raid and bloodshed, seems here fully established by independent evidence. Unless Iraq Government can convincingly deny identity of raiders, incident, considered in perspective of last few years, suggests that there is regular plan of armed infiltration to catch smugglers before they reach frontier, concerted with official disclaimers after the event. 2.

AMBASSADOR I\ p ! B KOWEIT-IRA,,, ARMS SMUOiJLING Zl have taken a copy of this Note for Bushipe files.^ c . J Mr. Walton. \&lt;&amp; Dr. Haji's statement (vide para.3 of Mr. Scott's I entirely disagree with Mr. Soott's reading of i fcer of ^ p^V ard September). The statement made by Dr. Naji is /contained I in para.9 of Political Agent, Koweit, telegram No.334 of 10th November, 1936, (P.Z.8744/36). The Mutasaarif's report is given in Ambassador, Bagdad, telegram of 7th Novembeiv 1936 (P.Z.8534/36), and consists of a bald statement that arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq has started again. This is the report (together with other reports) which Dr. Naji denies are correct. How in these circumstances Mr. Scott can read into Dr. Naji f s denial merely 'an admission that reports of open and active encouragement given by the Sheikh to arms smuggling were unfounded u personally I do not understand. As for Mr. Scott further saying 'doubtless if Dr. Naji went any further he was not reflecting the view of the matter usually taken in Iraq, it seems to me that a definite statement by a responsible Iraqi official who at that time held the important post of Foreign Minister must have considerable more weight than the views of other individuals. As I have pointed out in para.3 of my letter of June 8th (P.Z.4378/37), the Iraqi Government are continually bringing accusations against Koweit of arms traftic without producing any proof, and I regard Dr. Naji's statement as of considerable importance as a protection against such vague accusations. I deprecate very strongly any attempt to whittle Dr. Naj^s statement away, and, if you agree, I suggest that the F.O. might be informed that the 1.0. do not agree/ (Copy sent under P.L .No. G -35t) d. 1.12.'37 to P.

J- With regard to the particular arms snnigRling incident reported in Mr. Scott's letter already quoted, I agree that we might await the result of local investigation. I may point out, however, that the Iraqi reoort of the incident is, as usual, unsatisfactory. The incident is alleged to have taken place on the 15th July, and their report is dated Slst August, i.e. six weeks later. Neither the names of the two Bedouins or their tribes are given, nor is it stated whether they are Iraqi or Koweiti suhjects. The make of the two rifles is also omitted.

Mr # J.P.Gibson ) ) India Office. Mr # A # C,B .Symon) Mr .Baggallay ) ) Foreign Office. Mr.T.V.Brenan ) 2. Lr.Hendel said that the situation between Iraq' and Koweit, and particularly in regard to the question of smuggling, had become so difficult that it seemed desirable to take advantage of the presence in this country of Sir A.Glark Kerr and Sir T.^owle to have an informal interdepartmental discussion to see whether anything could be done to improve matters. There were two questions for discussion, an immediate one regarding a P. ItV- recent incident of a fairly serious character when Iraqi police had penetrated a long way into Koweiti territory, and a general one, i.e. the whole situation between Kmelt and Iraq and the policy which ought now to be followed. 3, As regards the first, it was clear from the Acting Political Resident's telegram No.994 of 18th October and Bagdad telegram No.238 of 20th October - the text of which was read out to the meeting - that Iraqi police had penetrated some 30 miles inside the Koweiti frontier. It was generally agreed that this case was so well established and so serious that a protest would certainly have to be made to the Iraqi Gcvernment about ... C Ci • I y ^ Kcw eit- Iraqj Smuggling .I si about; i'b« Sir T.^owle and 'the India Office representatiives were anxious that the Iraqis should be pressed to agree to an enquiry vvith. v /hich the tolitical Agent, Koweit, 'would he associated, in the hope that this might assist in establishing the principle of a joint enquiry into Iraq-Kovveit frontier ; incidents and prepare the way for the appointment of a joint frontier commission which would be in a position to enquire t into frontier incidents as soon as they had been reported. Sir A.Clarii Kerr and the Foreign Office representatives, however, felt that it would be useless to do more than to make a formal I protest, as there would be no hope, in existing conditions, of obtaining any satisfaction from the Iraqis. It was agreed that telegraphic instructions should be sent to ivlr.Scott to make a strong protest about this case as soon as possible. 4. Turning to the general question of smuggling, Mr.Hendel drew attention to the extremely unsatisfactory character of the present situation. The Sheikh of Koweit took the line that he was under no obligation to take any steps to stop smuggling. This 11 was perfectly correct, and the Sheikh was entirely within his legal rights in allowing the smuggling to go on. But as a result of this the Iraqis were becoming increasingly ill-disposed towards him, and it was becoming impossible for His Majesty f s Government to obtain from the Iraqis the settlement of any outstanding questions in which i the Sheikh of Koweit was involved. The most important of these was the question of the Sheikh's date gardens in Iraq, We were | unfortunately on weak ground in pressing the Iraqis to settle this | question, where we had entered into a perpetual commitment which I we had failed to get the Iraqis formally and specifically to take f over in 1924, though it was more or less covered by a general provision ...|8&gt; provision of our treaty. The Sheikh's attitude on the smuggling question had very greatly increased our difficulties. 5. Sir A.Clark Kerr strongly confirmed this statement. He explained that, if the Sheikh had shown the slightest willingness to meet the Iraqis over the question of smuggling a year ago, it would have been easy for him to secure a satisfactory settlement of the date gardens question. Hikmat Suleiman, the then Prime Minister, had been perfectly ready to conclude a comprehensive- settlement with Koweit, which would have disposed once and for all of all these questions. The Sheikh's insistence, however, on his legal freedom to allow smuggling to go on, and refusal to commit himself to the terms of any particular agreement with the Iraqis with a view to the suppression of smuggling, art least until the Saudi blockade of Koweit should have been lifted, had completely wrecked any hope of this comprehensive settlement, and had made it much more difficult to reach any kind of settlement of the date gardens question now. 6. Sir T.Fowle and the India Office representatives having insisted that smuggling was carried on mainly by Iraqis for the benefit of people in Iraq, Mr.Rendel replied that, even if this were so, Koweit must obviously bear the main responsibility for the smuggling, since it was through Koweit that the goods were imported. Moreover, the Sheikh himself had admitted that, if smuggling were stopped before the Saudi blockade was lifted, his State would be ruined. This gave a clear indication of the extent to which his State was at present engaged in smuggling, and the amount of profit derived therefrom. It was credibly reported that the Sheikh was at present putting aside at least £20,000 a year. Sir T.Powle expressed some doubt that this figure was accurate, or that the Sheikh's savings - whatever these might be - came entirely from profits ...v profits on smuggled goods # Mr.Rendel, on being asked what was the source of his information, replied that it was unofficial. Meanwhile, the only result of the Sheikhas present attitude was likely to be that the Iraqis would impose a rigid blockade which would cut off all trade of any kind. It would surely be wiser for the Sheikh to reach an agreement with Iraq, which would allow for the continuance of legitimate trade - of which a good deal would still be carried on Y^ith Southern Iraq - if only for the sake of avoiding Basra port dues etc., and which would also lead to a settlement of his outstanding difficulties with Iraq, such as the question of his date gardens, than to drive the Iraqis into imposing a rigid blockade, which would ruin the prosperity of his State, 7. Sir T.Fowle took the line that, even if this happened, the Sheikh would have no one but himself to blame, and that any odium which might arise from the action would fall on Iraq, not on His Majesty's Government. Mr.Rendel replied that, however this might be. His iaajesty's Government would be unable to escape all responsibility, Koweit was of political and strategical importance to them, and if it fell into ruin they would, in the end, suffer as much as anyone. Moreover, His Majesty^ Government could easily be represented by ill-intentioned people, both in the Arab countries and in Europe, as having failed to avert a situation where one of their special proteges was ruined by a powerful neighbour. There was every reason therefore why His Majesty's Government should seek to prevent such a situation from developing. 8. Sir A.Clark ] err confirmed that the Iraqis were becoming so tired of the situation that they were seriously contemplating the immediate imposition of a rigid blockade. Sir John Ward had already worked out detailed pit.- a blockade, which would ...Isu would probably include air patrols, searchlights at short intervals on the frontier etc # It was probable that the moment the Iraqis finally realised that the Sheikh was determined to do nothing to meet them, these plans would be put into effect. Ilr.Eendel drew attention to the fact that it would be extremely difficult for us to secure the lifting of such a blockade once it had been imposed, and expense had been incurred in putting it into effect. 9, Sir T.Fcwle said that he thought the situation might be eased if the Iraqis would at least agree to the demarcation of the frontier between Koweit and Iraq. Sir A.Clark Kerr and Mr.Eendel pointed out in reply that there was no reason why the Iraqis, from their point of view, should agree to anything at all in regard to Koweit. Their answer to any such proposals would be 'What are we going to get out of this?'. The Iraqis were at present so annoyed with the Sheikh of Koweit that they would certainly do nothing to meet his wishes without a very substantial quid pro quo . This the Sheikh of Koweit had steadily refused to offer them. 10. Sir T.Fowle urged that it was in accordance with international custom that a frontier commission should be appointed ^vould not this furnish a good reason for pressing the Iraqis to agree to it? Mr.Eendel pointed out that this argument only applied when nations were friendly. Frontier commissions had only been established with Iraq's other neighbours after general settlement had been reached with each. This was so in the case of Turkey, / Syria and Persia, where it had been impossible to do'anything about frontier commissions until general relations had been established on a satisfactory basis. 11. Sir A.Clark Kerr pointed out that, in the case of Koweit, the Iraqis regarded the Sheikh as a thoroughly unsatisfactory and unfriendly neighbour who was nothing but a nuisance and for whom they ...ISb' they were not prepared to do anything at all. The Sheikh was no doubt within his legal rights in refusing to co-operate oyer the suppression of smuggling, 'but he might have to pay heavily for insisting on those rights. 12, Sir T.Fowle emphasised the importance of not exercising any pressure on the Sheikh, The position of His Majesty's Government would become impossible if they tried to oblige him to follow some course of action, and he were to refuse to do so. It was not their policy to put pressure of this kind on the Persian Gulf rulers under their protection, Mr.Kendel reminded the meeting that His Hajesty's Government had not so long ago deposed the reigning Sheikh of Bahrein; but Sir T, Fowle regarded this case as not constituting a valid parallel. He entirely agreed however that it would be reasonable to put clearly before the Sheikh the choice of evils with which he was faced, provided he was allowed to choose freely between them. 13, After considerable further discussion, it was eventually agreed (a) that there would be no advantage to be gained ih asking the Iraqi Government to agree either to the demarcation of the Iraqi-} oweit frontier or to the establishment of a standing frontier commission at this stage, since they would inevitably refuse both suggestions; (b) that His Majesty's Ambassador should, however on his return to Bagdad ascertain the precise intentions of the Iraqi Government in regard to the proposed blockade, and inform His Majesty's Government and the Political Resident in detail of the particular form that that blockade was likely to take; (c) that the Sheikh of Koweit should then be warned in the clearest terms of the measures the Iraqi Government contemplated taking in order to put an end to the smuggling by instituting a blockade, and that every effort should be made to impress upon him tne extremely inconvenient/(S^ inconvenienti consequences to wliicii he would be exposed if he maintained his present attitude5 (d) that it should be suggested to the Sheikh that it would be in his own interests to choose the lesser of two evils, and to agree to meeting the Iraqis 1 wishes over the suppression of smuggling, in order that, if possible, some comprehensive settlement might be arrived at between him and Iraq, which would at least provide for the continuance of legitimate trade and make it easier for His x.ajesty^s Government to bring about an earlier settlement on the date gardens question; (e) finally, that, on the receipt of further information as to the precise measures which the Iraqi Government proposed to take with a view to instituting a blockade, the necessary instructions to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to give effect to conclusions (c) and (d) above should be drafted by the India Office and Foreign Office in consultation. POEEIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 25th November, 1937.V Confidential . D.O.No. C- ^16 r ^-.p -^1 Will you please refer to Bagdad telegram No.140 about Sir John Ward's scheme for operations on the frontier, I confess that I do not understand the telegram fully. One asks oneself - is it based on something the Iraq Government have said or written, or one about to write or say?. Does it refer to a complete two way Blockade, - or merely increased control on the Frontier ?. 2. I know the Sheikh's attitude. He will say that it is a matter for the Iraq Government; it is nothing to do with him. He has warned all Koweitis not to smuggle, and smuggling is now much reduced and entirely confined to Iraqis. We understand that in any case there are already twelve cars and three cutters on the frontier, one would think quite enough for the short frontier if efficiently handled, so it would only be an increase of two aeroplanes. The Sheikh will say that he has always advocated that the control should be made effective. it is a two-way complete Blockade Iraq will lose a certain amount of trade - not much, as owing to the heavy tax in Iraq it is seldom that iCoweit buys anything from Iraq. Koweit will merely order a few more goods from Bahrein and India. 4. In that case the only (iuestion remaining is water. When it comes to the point I doubt if Iraq will care to cut it off.

The 15th December, 1957.out it off• Water - at least to genuine Arabs - is not a thing one cuts off from fellow Arabs - if one does one is liable to be notoriously immortalized, like Saad and Shirnr, and it is contrary to the precepts of the Koran. However the Iraqis may now be sufficiently nationalized to be able to overlook this. 5. The Sheikh, I have seen to it, is alive to the danger. Cement tanks are being made by the richer merchants at a great rate to hold this winter's rain. The existing wells are sufficient for the poorer classes and the Bedouins, and they are being improved. The water boats from Iraq, from seven a day in January 1936 now average only two a day. Europeans- there is a total of 25 in Koweit territory using Basra water, - will be most harmed by the cutting of water and they can, on case of real need, I will see to it, obtain water from the B.I.Steamers, until some other arrangement, can be made. But on this subject of water I will address you separately and later. In any case smuggling is much reduced now, and this belated suggestion of 'operations^ on the frontier appears to indicate that there are political, rather than purely economic and administrative, motives at work. Various recent Arabic newspaper articles, all hostile to British control over the Persian Gulf, and several with the refrain of 'increased smuggling' from Koweit, seem to substantiate such a suspicion.CONFIDENTIAL.
