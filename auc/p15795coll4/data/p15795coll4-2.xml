The manuscript was composed by Butrus Girgis, and it was handwritten by Yusuf Hanna in 1843. It includes decca, a typical form of Coptic Orthodox illustration. Saint John Chrysostom, the author, served as the patriarch of Constantinople, a position forced upon him in 389 C.E.

Chrysostom means "golden-mouthed."</dc:description><dc:subject>Coptic illumination of books and manuscripts; Sermons</dc:subject><dc:date>1844</dc:date><dc:date>1844</dc:date><dc:type>Still Image</dc:type><dc:format>image/jp2</dc:format><dc:format>410 p.; 22 x 21 cm.</dc:format><dc:format>manuscripts (document genre)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>SC-2003-01-01-02-6</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscripts</dc:relation><dc:source>Iryan Moftah Collection of Manuscripts; Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscript and Book Collection; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2013, American University in Cairo.
