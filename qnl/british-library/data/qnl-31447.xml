Since the inception of the Karachi-Aden Air Route, although exemption from customs duty has been granted to R.A#P« property landed in Muscat territory, similar exemption has not been granted to B.O.A*C.property and duty has been recovered in a number of cases. 3» The Sultan so far as Salalah is concerned has also been fully exercising his rights of examination under Article 5 (5) of the Treaty in respect of both R.A.P# and B.O.A.C. property landed, he recently asked the Political Agent to obtain for him a list of B.O.A.C. property landed at Masirah and Has al Hadd for purposes of customs assessment cf. Muscat telegram Ho.0/1016 dated the 19th August 1942. ^ 4 * So far as Salalah is concerned petrol is consigned separately to the R.A.P. and to the B.O.A.C. and ships 1 consignment notes showing this have been handed by the Assistant Political Agent to the Sultan.

All this is known to the Sultan. 5. Had the Sultan been asked when the work on the Air Route was first started in 1941, to treat material belonging to the B.O.A.C. in the same way as material belonging to the R.A.J?* for the duration of the war, it is possible that he might have been persuaded to agree. To present him now with an ultimatum that no further payments of duty will be made on material for the B.O.A.C. will, I consider, have thw worst possible effect on him, especially after his recent compliance with our wishes in the matter of the Americans, and jeopardise his further co-operation in the war effort. So far as 1 amavare the B.O.A.C. have not been militarised or made part of the R.A.F., and it would appear there fore that customs duty on their imports to Muscat territory is technically due under the Treaty, in any case i do not think we should be wise to withdraw this small addition to the exiguous revenue of the Muscat State especially when it is calculated to cause the Sultan such deep offence. 6 # 1 would add that the Sultan appears to claim that Article 5 (4) (c) of the Treaty does not cover goods imported for the use of the shore personnel of Eis Majesty's iiaval and Air piwfc w-fj:). Forces cf. paragraph 4 of his letter dated the 11th August 1942 to the Political Agent, Muscat (enclosed with my letter Ho.C/771 of the 30th August 1942) and that this claim would appear to be correct from the wording of the Treaty. His Highness has not yet demnded duty on such goods but may well do so if we attempt to deprive him of what he regards as his rights in respect of material belonging to the B.O.A.C. sd. W.R.Hay.

V w t to the States for three and i am carrying on here in i apologise for my delay in acknowledging your letter of 20th~August with its most interesting enclosures. We have heard a good deal about the very great difficulties that were encountered in the discharge of cased petrol landed at the three East Arabian ports when the monsoon was making, it is quite clear that, particularly at kasirah, anyone responsible for discharge must have some alternative that will put him in a bargaining position with the local Arabs, and we shall make it our business to see that this is arranged when discharge is resumed after the monsoon, by , we' l mean the k.W.T., Divisional Sea Transport Officer and the R.A.E.Transport Officer, i expect that in future any vessels doing these jobs will have Hired Transport status, and will therefore be in the immediate province of D.S.TO., but obviously there must be co-ordination in which i will do all that i can to as sis t. The Inland Water Transport Army organisation, which as you know has a virtual monopoly of barges and tewing craft in these parts is desparately short, but I hope the situation may slightly have eased by the time the Arabian ports come again into the picture. i shall see if i can get any arrangements made in advance and will connect with hr.Ielly who seems to have battled manfully with very considerable difficulties.

I have asked the Wali of Sur to take necessary- action in the matter and I have also given him some instructions to hoot. On the occasion of my visit to Ras-al-Had what I saw there, I request that you will communicate to the authorities concerned that it is not advisable to keep things there scattered over and especially munition and other articles which are liable to explosion. I suggest that for such articles there should be a special store and proper guards on them. But if they#kept in the present state, a thief cannot be blamed for commission of theft. As I made a suggestion to you there a boundary limit should be made of empty drums of tar separating the station and v/orking places where there are operations and materials from the city and other places which are frequented by people of that area for their necessities. Then a place should be fixed in that area for ordinary guards. I noticed entire disorganisation in the management there in all repeats which is calculated to impede and delay the progress of work the result of which will not be good. I, therefore,request that you will have these matters properly arranged so that we^may extend our co-operation. Usual EndingTELEGRAM w Telegram From To Repeated to No. 'S 1 '.

The short runway is probably extensible to 1400 yards but has been stopped at 1000 yards as the wind is always strong when in that direction. ‘‘A Gurvey should be carried out immediately to locate the limits of tidal encroachment and work on the extension of the runway to the maximum possible lehgth&gt; put in hand.

No aggregate over Vl' has bean used in the mix. (d) SURFACING DETAILS. The material is pure bitumen mix-in-place using F 70 from Abadan/ 1500 tons of bitumen were sent to fcb g site. No rolling of formation was carried out before laying of mix after excavation. The mixing is carried out in small Millar Mixer (6 cu.ft)* Bitumen is heated to 250°F in large iron boilers standing onthe ground and heated by steam coal. Th) mix was laid down at 7 lb. per cubic foot of aggregate but whs increased to 8 with experience. In certain areas where the aggregate is very fine 9 lbs* per ou. ft. has been used. The mix is laid 4 ,, thick and consolidated firstly by hand tamping onthe third day after laying and then by rubber tyred rollers. The practice is to roll the freshly Icid material in the cool of the morning and the older portions when they are softened by the sun in the afternoon. The. design of the rubber-tyred rollers is bad as ridges are left between wheels and the leading sot of wheels tends to make a deeper impression than the trailing set. Corrugations made by the first rolling are no* entirely obliterated by the second rolling which is transverse to the first. Accordingly there is a tendency to transverse oorrugAtioig on the nair)£unway and longitudinal corru gations on the cross runway, being the direction of the initial rollings. The corrugations are about 9* from crest to crest, are very shallow cuil will not affect aircraft. An iron roller about 4 tons weight would probably have been more satisfactory, finished thickness is about 3*:'. m n j - A 4- V* 70 orwv^a^ nr Th/1 OO The native labour invariably puts aown en excess. v ; emu « result pools of bitumen have formed in the corrugations.

Concrete running-up platforms about 20 yards square probabljr be required. The sand appears suitable for cement stabilization and this will be investigated when the analysis is obtained. Construction of a dispersal track for aircraft would only be possiBe fairly close to the runways owing to the proximity of the sea under spring tides.

These mixers were originally designed to he driren by a Ruston engine but owing to the present situation various types of high speed diesel engines have been installed. Three are driven by Lister engines one of which is slightly smaller than' the other two and can only turn 5 cu.ft. of mix in the hopper. The other two Listers can turn 7 cu.ft. but have been worked at 6 cu.ft. e driven by the originally specified Ruston engine which works satisfactorily. The remaining_two are driven by Fetter engine which are only capable of turning 4 mi.tft. in the hooper. A spare Fetter engine is held but even though this has been robbed for spares onlyoi^of the two Fetter engine mixers is serviceable, pending arrival of spares. The mixers are being kept at Raa-el-Kadd for possible use at Masira. ( 4 ) . Seven rubber typed rollers, which are towed by the tractors. Thes£ havj an unloaded weight of about 3 tons and have a steel plate loading tray carried on two lines of four wheels about 4 f between centres. Each line of wheels consists of two pairs mounted on independent axles. The tyres are 7-J-” x 10” and the wheels are so arranged that a to'tal front of gaps in the front line. In theory the erects at l f -3 w centres left by the front row should be flattened out by the rear row to leave crests at 7^r n centres, and the transverse rolling ahould completely remove any corrugation. In practise however the effect of the second row is not so marked as that of the first row and the iransvere rolling makes hardly any impression. It would appear that the roller would be more effective if the wheels were all mounted in a continous line, but in any case final rolling by wide flat roller seems essential. Experiments have been carried out with reducing the tyre pressure but no marked improvement was obtained. The rollers are all in good condition with the exception of one which is u/s on account of a broken bearing. The tyres are practically unworn. (5). .M/T. There are 2 3 tons Ford lorries a Chev. Station Wagon and two motor bicycles 0 All these are in running order with the exception of one of the bicycles, but are badly in need of spares. This will be taken up by the Engineer Officer taking over. (g)- All small hand tools, shovels? tampers eto will be left at Ras-el-Hadd. S T 0 RES. (®) Local availability - Engineer Stores. Practically no stores are available locally. Reed mats can be obtained in small quantities from Sur and a certain amount could be purchased fn Muscat. Country nails and string are also available in Muscat but it is recommended that all building materials should be sent from Iraq or India. It is strongly recommended that bullies and mats etc should be imported direct from Karachi or Zanzibar. Karachi merchants may be able to arrange supplies from Zanzibar. It is stressed that the peoulier difficulties in carrying out work on the South Arabian shore are considerable any regulations must be relaxed if progress is to be made. The local G*E* must have considerable power of local purchase and facilities for travelling. The latter will be provided as far as possible by the R.A.F. The G.E. must also be in a position to effect immediate payment for locally purchased stores as the local merchants expect this and will not accept further orders if they find payment is not effected promptly. Notes regarding bullies ex Sharjah in para 11 of the I ; ■ ra report should also be noted. There is an outerop of hard rock south west of the vxiljtxg village which has been used by the locals for c^nstnjtotior of huts using a calcarious mortar, but this rock is difficult to work and cement bloelr Construction is recommended for any building work other than barusti or prefabricated hutting.

Date /; Tb^ 1 ckimete is better at Ras-el-Hadd than in the ^'/ rs ^ an , Monsoon was still blowing strongly from the south on 4th September all it was noted that it had swung to the north on the 7th. Velocity was. 15 m.n.h. The duration of the monsoon could not be ocactly ascertair.:. but it appears to be from mid May to mid September. Luring this per::: strong south wind prevails and at other times the winds are light and variable with no definite prevailing direction. During the monsoon, the mid^oy temperature was low and at night. cool, two blankets being required even in a hut. As it is cool in wir, in any case the warmest periods are probably during April, Lay and September and October. Mr. Moore whofias been at Ras-el-Hadd since states that, in his tent and without a fan, he has always wojn pyj^ night. The highest recorded temperature in his tent was 107?F.

(Appendix W E’' attached This wsa unfavourably reported upon by Mr. Lloyd Taylor as a flying boat base. The water area of sufficient depth is not more than li miles in any direction and the Khor is bounded on the north, east and west by rocks up to 200* high. Figures recently given at Air Headquarters gave a minimum water run of 2,500 yards followed by a minimum climbing angle of 1 in 50, 1 in 100 preferably. If these figures are correct the use of Xhor Jarama by modem flying boats is precluded. It has been recommended that, if Xhor Jarama is used as an alighting area a road should be constructed to Khor Hajar which is much more suitable for unloading stores. The present track is not motorable* The sea entrance to Xhor Jarama is dangerous. M R.A.F. Petrol Store consisting of two 4,000 gallon bu3.k tanks exists in a stone building on the site indicated on the sketch.

The improvement of the L.G. can be carried on until all unhalations have been levelled off. ('b') NATURE OF GROUND. Masira is generally a volcanic island which has . ^experienced considerable weathering. The moncoon. ®ind ahi&amp;h 'blowc strongly from the south-west int&lt;r^ll the pockets and valleys between the hills, and this sand is stiffened by chips of basaltic ronjc resulting from the levelling of tho hills. The aerodrome is sited on one of these pockets and the surface layer-consists of a fim-sandy gravel which lies to a depth of three to six feet on top of-solid rook, ihe surface is firm and hard enough to take heavy aircraft. It might be unserviceable for a few hours after heavy rain but as far as can be ascertained rain is extremely rare on the island. (c) DISPERSAL. Adequate dispersal is possible all round the strips. •It widrl probably be neo-e&amp;sary to construct--rewing-up standings 20 vds. souare on sites to be selected by a G.D. Officer.

This Shaikh was present with Wall of Sur when the incident occured. Saiyid Shihab matter did not mention this/of pending settlement and compensation on his last visit here^ Otherwise I should have told him what I heard from the Shaikh and given him my views. Am still in the openion that the action taken by the Sentry at Ras^Al-Kad was right and compensation in this case is unjust! -fied otherwise it will establish a principle or precedent for the future secondly the man was killed on the spot within the camp boundry while tiying to steal therefore I cannot understand on what ground Saiyid Shihab and the Wall suggest compensation. I see no reason why the section of Bani Bu Hasan concerned should take offensive unliss they wish trouble .Does Saiyid Shihab . o** the t.ali think that the action against the thief was unjustified?z 5 &gt; &gt;P 0 Who authorised Wall of Sur to guarantee the tribe to be satisfied? I do not agree with the suggestion of Saiyid section of Shihab. I shall be grateful to know which/Bani Bu Hasan concerned in this case# Wali should be asked to explain to Bani Bu Hasan that the man was killed on the spot while trying to steal and they have no case in this matter unless they wish trouble for which they will be liable for punish ment. I consider a firm stand in this case is necessary. Am sending a letter to the Wali ty first opportunity and shall explain ny views to him.
