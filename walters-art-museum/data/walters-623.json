It displays an image of the Nile god Hapy with an offering table in his arms. Hapy represented the Nile River and its fertilizing inundation. \r\n\r\nHapy wears a crown of papyrus buds and blossoms, a collar, a divine beard, armlets and a narrow girdle with three ends in front, the characteristic costume of this god. The offering table has two water jars and two lotus plants, with more lotuses hanging from Hapy's left arm. A royal cartouche crowned with plumes and a sun-disk is in front of the legs of the god, but it is empty and does not contain the name of a king.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, before 1931", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/26826", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Joseph Brummer (?)
