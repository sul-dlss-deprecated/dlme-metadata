The I rincipality of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na’asan, Sitra, and Nabi Salih, and by a number of lesser islets and rocks. Taken altogether these form a compact group almost in the middle of the V-shaped gulf on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf wdiich divides the independent Arab Trucial Sheikhdom of Qatar from the coast of Qatif in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 2. The term “ Bahrein ” formerly embraced the promon tory of Qatar and the oases of Qatif and Hasa on the Arabian mainland, as weil as the islands of the archipelago, and, according to Lorimer, “ some authorities would attribute to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.” II.—Bahrein prior to 1783. 3. The very conflicting evidence available goes to show that Bahrein was subject to Persian rule for a period in the early part of the Christian era, and between A.D. 615 and 723. It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshan bin Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the Oommiyyad Caliphs, in the latter year, and to have remained under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the Abbaside dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became subject to chiefs of its own race. Its mediaeval history is obscure, but a writer who visited the islands in A.D. 1051 refers to the fact that half of the pearls taken in Bahrein belong to the Chiefs of Hasa on the Arab mainland.

Persia regained possession of Bahrein. They appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein m 16^2. Cnrzon, Ourzon states that “ the Portuguese . . . m 1625 concluded Persia, II, a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to him 419 - all his coast possessions, retaining only the pearl banks at Bahrein. ...” 4. In or about 1718 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who, however, appear to have maintained their occupation for a short time only. It is not clear whether at the date of this attack the islands were derelict or whether they were held by a Persian garrison. About 1753 the Ruler under the Persian Government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident tribe in which (the Huwalah Arabs—at the present day still stronghy represented in the islands) was seriously divided by internal feuds, and established his authority there. In this manner the islands again became, at least in name, dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce wRich had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a descent on the island of Bahrein. They defeated the Persian Governor, drove him to his fort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a Bushire vessel, with which they retired to Zubarah. A counter attack was repulsed, and in the following year the Uttabi Arabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands, the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on 28th July 1783, alter a siege of about two months’ duration, and being allowed to return to Bushire. 5. It will be seen that while the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 is very obscure, it would appear that Persia for 11 ot inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands. The nature of that control is not, however, very clear; it seems probable that it was only very rarely of a definite character; and even in more recent periods Summary.3 3“s: ,’£ r „‘iu''r d, p r* f ” * o, OT ,,iordii P ni'int L'srirrt' ?• during the 30 years prior “n'^f^Ksians 8 by the Arabs of the mainland in 1783. eisians III.-—1783 1820.

In 1799 the Imam of Muscat declared war on the Uttabis of Bahrein, who, alarmed bv his pi oceedings, opened a correspondence with the Persian governor of Bushiie, in the course of which they stated that the island originally belonged to the Turkish Government, but that it was many—about 70—years since the Turks had been in possession of it* He, on their offering to become tributary to Persia, proceeded privately to Bahrein and received irom them an instalment of revenue on account of the preceding year. Muscat occupies and loses Bahrein, 1800-01. 7. In 1800 Bahrein was occupied hy the Imam of Muscat, the occupation lasting until 1801, when the Muscat forces were invested by the Uttabis and compelled to surrender and evacuate Bahrein. In 1802 the Imam of Muscat, having obtained some assistance from Bushire, again landed in Bahrein and attacked the Uttabis. The latter had, however, by now secured the support of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia and the Muscat project was abandoned. Bahrein under Wahabi influence, 1803-11. 8. From 1803 to 1809 the Uttabis of Bahrein appear to have been under the influence of the Wahabis, (the Bombay Government declined to take action on an enquiry made by them in 1805 as to whether, if they withdrew from the Arabian mainland and withheld their assistance from the Wahabis, the British Government would give them a ship or two to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein) and they were under strict control by the Wahabi Government during 1810-11.

In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authori ties that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Attabis of his suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811 bv their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, ifflbed a landina in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew.

His Majesty’s representative stated, that an agent of the Sheikh of Bahrein was also at lehran bearing a letter which stated that as the inhabitan s o e island were of the same sect as the natives of 1 ersia, t ey had always looked up to the Persian monarch as their protector and head, and that they therefore hoped for the assistance of His Majesty to cloak them from the oppressions of the Wahabis. Approval for the grant of the military assistance desired was stated to have been given by the bhah to the Imam, but no action appears to have followed. 11. In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians inHasa,. the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to assist them Lor. 1,846. w ith sea transport. In February 1819 the Sheikh entered into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of which he subsequently failed to comply, for preventing the sale of captured British property in his dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, under a misapprehension as to the nationality of certain vessels, of the neutrality of his port. 12. On the 19th April 1819 His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran reported to the Government of India that the Imam of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non- fulfilment of the engagements contracted with him by the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein. The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urged upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him ‘ had for ages acknowedged the sovereignty of Persia.” He was, however, unsuccessful, and in J une 1819 His Majesty’s Minister reported that the Shah had “ for the present dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It mav be added here that the Government of Bombay in a desoatch of 21st J uly 1819 to the Government of India,^ in whiclf they discussed the desirability of assisting the Imam of Muscat m re turn for assistance in connection with the expedition proposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims to Bahrein referred to an “arrangement some time since concerted between the, Shah and the Imam, whereby tS former ‘had agreed to relinquish all claims to the rsland of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of receiving a portion of its revenues.” Bahrein submits to Muscat, 1820 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820 moved apparently by a desire to anticipate anvluto™ \ i ™ 1 to establish control over Bahrein witl ^ by Muscat Majesty’s Governnienl^lins^shSb ^ to convey their troops to Bahrein, They addressed a suSapplication, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the British Expedition m the Persian Gulf. In the earlv nart nf !820 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam o± Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,000 dollars An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to have been actually remitted. Policy of British Government, 1819-20. . ^ r ^ ] ^ le P? lic y adopted by the British Government m regard to Bahrein was examined between the Government of Bombay and the Government of India in 1819-20, and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. ’ The transfer of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat had been contem plated, but this project, so far as the British Government were concerned, was now abandoned. r Ihe Government of Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage of a friendly neutrality on the part of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him. They added that the conclusion of an engagement in general terms with the Sheikh “ would probably tend to convince the Uttabi Arabs of the integrity of our intentions.” British Offer to Persia of Mediation with Bahrein, 1820. 15. Simultaneously the Government of Bombay, in a despatch to the Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, remarked that “ we mean to avoid all interference in respect of the island of Bahrein. . . . There is, however, reason to believe that provided the Persian Government will consent to the Uttabis continuing in the undisturbed occupation of Bahrein the Sheikh would readily agree to pay them tribute, and for this purpose the mediation of the British Government would be gladly afforded provided it could be employed in such a manner as to avoid anything which might in any shape involve us in the transactions of the parties after the conclusion of the negotiation immediately referred to. . . . ” Treaty of 1820 between Bahrein and His Majesty’s Government. 16. On the 17th January 1820 the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories, and undertook to the British Government not to admit any more boats of the same character until authorised to do so by the British authorities. On the 5th February 1820 a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, and on the 23rd February 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had been made between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which His Majesty’s Government undertook, in return for abstention by those rulers from piracy and the slave trade, that if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it” (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to claim subsequently that the treaty in question established relations of protection and dependence between the British Government and himself, but it was made clear to him by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf while on a visit to Bahrein in 1823 that this was not the case. Proposal for British Mediation with Bahrein not tahen up by Persia, 17 On 10th May 1820 His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran renorted to the Government of Bombay that he had been received in audience by the Shah on oth May and had put 2953 Lor.

On the 3rd October 1820 the Government of Bombay instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government u that as our views are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shahj and the Uttabis of Bahrein.” Summary, 1783-1820. 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year’s tribute, but it was immediately afterwards conquered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Government, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to “ take notice ” “ if any shall attack them.” IV.—1820-30. Unauthorised Agreement between Captain Bruce and the Prince Governor of Shiraz, 1822. 20. In 1822 Captain Bruce, then Political Resident in me Persian Gull, acting on his- own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, on the part of Persia. This agreement alleged inter aha, m regard to Bahrein, that the islands had always been h U rs ’ a 8 ainst whose authorUv tiie Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious- that the flag assigned to the Uttabis of Bahrein under the General I reaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 should accordi^X U future h® m t M rawn, that no assistance should in hit n„ M 6 . d by B !' ltaiu t0 ‘he Uttabis of Bahrein and eque ted asskt ^ • British .

With regard to the clause of the agreement affecting Bahrein the Government of Bombay remarked : “ It acknowledges the n £ Gng of f ersia s title to Bahrein, of which there is not the Bombay to least proof, and which the British Government cannot assert Capt. Bruce without injuring the pretensions of the Imam [of Muscat] and 1491 of the Uttabis. . . . On the Persian side, the Shah not only 1-H-Ijp2, refused to approve the arrangements which had been made, para - 6 - but expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz Teh. Desp. should have entered into any engagement with the British No -1= Government without his knowledge and injunctions. The 25 - 1 - 1823 - agreement was thus repudiated by both sides. 1822-29. Bahrein—Muscat Disputes. 22. By 1822, if not earlier, the Sheikhs of Bahrein had Lor. I, 851. ceased to observe the engagement undertaken by them in Govr. to 1820 to pay an annual tribute to Muscat. In August 1822, Imam, an attack by Muscat on Bahrein seeming in consequence Qoy r 18 t Q 2, imminent, the Governor of Bombay, in letters to the Sheikh g£Iikh° and to the Imam of Muscat, suggested that if this tribute 19.8.1822. was of ancient origin it should be regularly paid, but that Precis, 307. otherwise it should be dropped. In January 1823 the k 01 *- P 850 * Political Resident (Lieut. McLeod) visited Bahrein to Resdt. to reassure the Sheikhs in regard to the unratified treaty Govt, of concluded by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of nTcTs^ Shiraz, and to inform them that that treaty was of no effect 27.2.1823. and that no change of policy was contemplated by Govern- Lor. I, 852. ment. In the spring of 1823, on rumours of a contemplated G-ovt. 0 f joint attack on Bahrein by Persia, Muscat and the Arabs of Bombay to the mainland, the Minister at Tehran was asked at a suitable juncture to dissuade the Persians from disturbing the 26°3.1823. tranquillity of the Gulf. 23. In February 1824 the Resident composed for a period of two years the acute internal disputes between members of the ruling house which were for many years a feature of the Lor.

In 1825 the Governor of Bombay personally remonstrated with the Imam of Muscat on an endeavour by the latter to interfere in the question of the Bahrein succession consequent on the death in that year of Sheikh Salman, who had ruled the Sheikhdom since 1796 (in Lor.

During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat/ From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently nt feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was concluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to in 1822 and 18t-5 but not pressed. 27. In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, His Majesty s Government hawing refused to intervene in their favour, and fearing a combination between the Amir and Muscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir’s supremacy and to pay a tribute to him. He on his part undertook to protect Lor. 1,856-7. Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis betw r een 1833 and 1835.

Internal dissension in the ruling family became more marked between 1834 and 1839, and the misgovernment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty’s Government, although in 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820.

In the middle of 1836 the Sheikh, alarmed by a Bombay communication from the Governor of Shiraz calling on him Selections, as a 1 ersian subject to tender his submission to the Shah ^85. and by the possibility of the co-operation of the Imam of Lor - 1 » 858 - Muscat m a f ersian attack on Bahrein, took steps for a reconciliation with the Wahabi Amir. As a result, he agreed to pay a nominal tribute of f 2,000 to the Amir, the Amir on his side agreeing to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein against external attacks and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a \\ ahabi attack on Muscat by sea. 31* In 1837 the Sheikh, with the prior approval of Her Lor. I, 860. Majesty’s Government, was allowed to punish certain pirates. In 1839 the Resident was invoked to settle internal disputes in the ruling family, but the parties would not agree to any settlement without a guarantee by Her Majesty’s Government, which Her Majesty’s Government were not prepared to give. Egyptian Invasion of Hasa : Sheikh professes to be a Persian Subject, 1839. 32. In 1838-39 the Egyptians conquered Hasa and cap- Bombay tured the Wahabi Amir. They thereupon demanded the Selections, payment of tribute and certain territorial concessions from the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commander about 4 the same time intimated to the British authorities his inten tion to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed for assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty’s Government the Govern ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himself as to waiting on the Egyptian representative. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, “and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,” the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures bv the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Lor. I, 862. Haji Qasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, “ and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was disposed to pay for their countenance and protection,” and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to ^ the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied by a guard ot Sele0ti ^ 8j 10 Persian infantry. No details appear to be available X XIV,388. about his mission, which was apparently a failure. 33 On 1st April 1839 Admiral Sir F.

In July 1839 the Sheikh “ suddenly and un expectedly” acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars a year, on the understanding that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The Resident protested in writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support. For a trifling financial payment he had now secured immunity from 'interference. He offered, however, in return for a written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Her Majesty’s Government; but on being pressed he refused to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result of compulsion by Her Majesty’s Government. 1839-40.

As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over Bahrein On 1st July 1839 the Secret Committee of the East India Company informed the Government of India that if necessary they would “ not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet All, but we concur in the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell [then Political Resident] as to whether it would be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government On 24th February 1840 the Foreign Office wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from t e ombay Government) that it was important that the Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take possession of ja rem and that if the Company’s troops could occupy it, even provisionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement of the Egyptians horn Hasa m 1840 their relations witli the Sheikh came to an end.

The Persians reasserted their claim in 1836, the Bahreini answer being a renewal of their understanding with the Wahabi Amirs. In 1839, when faced by a demand for tribute from Bahrein appealed to Persia, claimed to be a Persian subject, and received a Persian envoy. But immediately after she formally acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and paid tribute to Egypt. The visit of the Persian envoy had thus no effective sequel. VI.—1840-50. 37. In 1840 the Government of India, provoked by the attitude which the Sheikh had adopted, decided not to restrain the Imam of Muscat in the event of his wishing to conquer Bahrein. On 27th March 1840 the Secret Committee remarked to the Government of India “We consider our- No. 591, selves . . . relieved from all regard to the interests of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and we should be glad to hear that his rtclS ’• island was in possession of a friendly chieftain.” 38. Towards the end of 1840 the Imam of Muscat India Board informed the Resident that while his views in regard to Bahrein remained unaltered, he had been restrained from giving effect to them by his impression that Her Majesty’s Government were averse to the prosecution of his claim and that without their assistance or that of the Egyptians, he would have no chance of success. Expulsion of Sheikh Abdullah. Succession of Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa (1843-68). 39. Internal dissensions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler, Sheikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co ruler, Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and Sheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty s Lor. I, 866. Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was ■expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikhdom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers which was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. * Intrigues of ex-Sheikh, 1843-49. 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Irucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover h.s position. In 1843 Lor. , . Her Majesty's Government dissuaded Muscat from ^ conouer Bahrein— considerations which weighed with them Sgfntr alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse he cause of the S ex-Sheikh. g In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice lisited Bushire where he failed to find any consolation from T Res^Xwho, on his stating that if^apPOin^by Her fi est y’ s o f°”^brme7b r m (October 1843) that the°adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognise by thTex-Sheikh entered into 41 .

I, 876- 7. promised him military assistance from Persia. On repre sentations being thereupon made to the Persian Prim Minister by Her Majesty’s Minister ap lehran, the Pnme Minister “informed me that Sheikh Suleiman had acte wi great presumption in having interfered in political allairs without having any authority from the Government, and he said that he would reprimand him for his conduct. His Excellency added that Bahrein belonged to Persia and that she would take possession of it when more pressing affairs were disposed of. As I looked on this as meie idle boasting which was never likely to be Julfilled, I thought it unnecessary to pursue the conversation.” 42. It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December 1843 to March 1844, he is stated to have been received with distinction by the Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated, to pay the cost, to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah, and to leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by force any attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of Bahrein. During the same year the ex-Sheikh, having, while residing at Naband in South Persia, captured two Bahreini vessels, the ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the result that an injunction was issued by the Central Persian Government at the instance of the British envoy directing the Governor-General of Pars to compel Sheikh Abdulla to give up the boats he had taken and abstain from disturbing the peace of the Gulf. Views of His Majesty’s Government on Persian Claim and on future Policy, 1844-45. . 44. Consequent on indications that Persia intended to intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was bj i Majesty’s Government in the early part of 1844, m the light of an intimation by the Government ot India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty’s Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran. ^ 0- p 23 ’ dat . ed H 1844 ) tha t “ the question of the right oi Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government 8 to pievent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty’s Government are ignorant of' tlie grounds of such pretension, and, assuming Ihose grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Govern ment the right to prevent, if it accorded with its poHcv to do so, any direct interposition of Persia in ,K„ ^ of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein TheVinP b £=r i*. .t ” 1 v h “ 2 unless Persia can show tlmf 8 i mt ® lests &gt; an&lt; 4&gt; therefore, putable rigtit to tbe' TO,„i gn „ i ;'“'“'l »&lt;‘»- 'it rfeLtsiT '■ d ' = e? t to the maintenance ofVr lawfuV! 8 ^ 4 18 dlrected13 prepared to encounter in any scheme of this kind the active rcZsta^ct the Mini te G0TCrnraent “ India -” Ia ^ circumstances the Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government that “ Her Majesty’s Government had heard with regret that that Government contemplated taking part m the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy ^'A he f B p h t Govern ™^t in India; and that unless the right of Persia to interfere m the matter is beyond dispute any interference on her part might lead to unpWsan discussions with England. For, although Her Majesty’s Government do not dispute the right of Persia as an independent power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign states which she might think advantageous to herself, they claim for themselves a corresponding right to judge and act in such matters as they may think fit. Discussions with Persia, 1844-45. 45. On a communication in these terms being made to the Persian Prime Minister, the Prime Minister ‘‘said he would undertake to prove the right of Persia to possession of that island, and that in the meantime he would not make any movement against it without giving previous notification of such an intention to the British Government.” 46. In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home a letter received from the Prime Minister, from which it appeared that the Persian claim was essentially based on the Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 above.) 47. In a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he had informed the Prime Minister that the Bruce Agreement was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time, and that the Prime Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty’s Minister had made con sequent on the receipt of this statement “ confirmed me in the opinion that this island has not formed part of the dominions of Persia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty [17951. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to this country [Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknow ledgment of subjection,' :i: ' and it is also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themselves to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with subjugation from Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised any real control over it within the last 50 or 60 years.” The Minister added that in further support of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at Bahrein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ah Shah Kajar, which he believed to be genuine. 48. The fuller statement of .claim put forward by the Persian Government was investigated by the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company, who, after detailed examination of it, reached the conclusion “ that Persia has no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein. It may be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el- Arab to M uscat and all the islands m it belonged to ~~ * On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked • “ Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty and they ha™ not been confined to Persia.” (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July Is-io.) 2953 Teh. toF.O., Ho. 69 of 22.6.1844.

Ihe object and desne of tho Persian Government has since always been and is the fVi q t island from its snoilers.” 49. Her Majesty’s Government, in view of the unlikeli hood that Persia had, or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merely cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime Minister’s memorandum) to show generally the grounds on which Her Majesty’s Government were “ unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add that they would . . . very much disapprove of any attempts on the part of Persia to interfere in the affairs of that island and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy.” The question appears to have dropped for the time being.

Meanwhile, the ex-Sheikh (who in 1845 had unsuccess- tdly attempted to capture Bahrein with the aid of the Wahabis) had been invited in June 1846 by the Governor- -teneral of Pars to return to Bushire, where he should be liberally ^entertained “ until ... the season for action had m , 16 declm ed the invitation.

His ’ ‘ grievances were accordingly remedied by the Government ^334 of of Bombay. That Government represented, however, that it 31.7.1847. was^ desirable to exclude interference in Gulf affairs by foreign Powers, since unless Her Majesty’s Government retained the supreme control they could not secure the permanence of the objects (the suppression of piracy, &amp;c.) on which so much money had been spent. The Court of Directors concurred in the Government of Bombay’s recommendation “ that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British Naval Force” and that the Pesident should be so informed. 55. On 11th October 1847 the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, in which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Government had no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that “ if the Indian Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly connection with England.” The Resident, who deemed it inexpedient that Her Majesty’s Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the Resident ‘‘had exercised a wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new treaty with Bahrein. The Resident wa*s, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty s Govern ment. Sheikh’s Request to be taken under British Protection REFUSED (1849). _ LoI , I, 882. 56 In January 1849, however, the Sheikh spontaneously Bombay asked to be taken under British protection.

Her Majesty’s Government, on consideration ol the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put for ward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. They assured him at the same time of their general goodwill, and their deliberations made it clear that they regarded the island as independent, but were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation to it so long as its independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so. Disputes with Wahabis, 1850-51. 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of “irresponsible character.” Consequent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdulla were Lor. I, 884. associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh “ against his own better judgment . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,” a circumstance from which it may perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. The Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir “ when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.” Peace was subsequently made with the Wahabis in July 1851.

In the same year Her Majesty’s Government decided that the Turkish Government should be informed at Con stantinople^ that Her Majesty’s Government, having heard that the bheikh was desirous of placing himself under Turkish, protection, could not acknowledge or acquiesce in any such arrangement, seeing that the Government of British India had had relations with Bahrein as an independent16 17 ^ ta iS20 D lr a ttri 1Clnded • vith { } C ® rtain trea ties, namely,one n 1820 for the suppiession of piracy and one in 1847 for the prohibition of the exportation of slaves, and that Her ajesty s Government must object to any arrangement which would transfer Bahrein to the dominion or protectorship ot any other rower. ^ 62 In the correspondence leading up to this decision Lord Palmerston remarked: “ I come to the conclusion that it is the opinion of the East India Company that the object first to be aimed at is to prevent Bahrein from falling under the control of any foreign Power, and to keep that island in its present condition of political independence. But 1 infer from what has been stated in the despatches which you have communicated to me, that if that independence could no longer be maintained, and if the ruler and the people of Bahrein were determined to place themselves under some foreign protection, the East India Company would think that less evil would arise from affording to Bahrein British protection than from allowing French, Persian or Turkish authority to be established in that island.” Attitude of the Wahabis and of Muscat, 1852-53. 63. In 1852 the Sheikh proposed to withhold his tribute from the Wahabi Amir, but on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In the same year the Consul at Zanzibar w T as instructed to inform the Imam of Muscat that Her Majesty’s Government saw no reason' to alter the views regarding the possession of Bahrein communicated to His Highness in 1849 (paragraph 58 above). In May 1853 the Government of India authorised the Government of Bombay to offer every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabi Amir (who was now nominally subject to the Turkish Government) on the ground that Her Majesty’s Government would not permit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Government or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. Principle of Non-interference in Internal Affairs laid down by Bombay Government (1854). 64. On 20th November 1854 the Government of Bombay in a letter to the Resident laid down the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised the Resident simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Qatif on the Arab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of Bahrein. Slavery Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government (1856). 65. On the 10th May 1856 an agreement supplementary to the Treaty of 1847 (paragraph 51 above) regarding the slave trade was made with the Sheikh. Its contents were identical with that of corresponding engagements entered into at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. 66. The Sheikh’s internal government continued to go from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects m Bahrein In 1859 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention. The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon to the Senior Naval Officer ; the Wahabi ruler, however, made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein, and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan o± Turkey The Resident, in reply, informed him ot tne determination of Her Majesty’s Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the inconsistency of his piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Governmen .

Ihe Persian emissary, however, refused to l^ave Bahrein or surrender his imaginary authority in the Sheikhdom. Ihe Resident reported in July 1860 that “the Ottoman flag has now become the national one.'’ The Sheikh appears to have endeavoured to play off each party against the other. Views of the Minister at Tehran and the Government of Bombay. 68. The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. He pointed out to the Persian Government “ that under no circumstances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Crown, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the mainten ance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ” ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no military occupation df Bahrein should be attempted until the title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister s views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest • in ^ n ^ ma ^ 0n Ihe matter had been referred to Her Majesty’s Government; but at the same time that the agents of both Powers (Turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neighbour ing tribes would not be allowed and would, if necessary, be prevented by force. In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests t P eace ° f G . uif 11 would be better that Babr em ltke d v be no T eS h rd p aS in i epen . deD ‘ and as subject neither to recessed aid a ‘ ltS . lade P eIld ^ce should be recognised and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preservl maintained 6 ^ ^ g0 ° d 0rder o£ the should be Her Majesty’s Government decide that Bahrein shaix be regarded as Independent (1861). discussion WeeJthehjndirOffi' 1 '' 08 ^ f 0 !?™™ 6111 . af ter approved the recommeldatio*^?!

The Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened with forcible measures by the Resident and two o , 18 . ® lll P s dye r e se iz ed. He accordingly submitted, and on dlst May 1861 he signed a Friendly Convention with the Resident, acting on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, by which he entered into a “perpetual treaty of peace and lnendship with Great Britain, and in which, as “ indepen dent ruler of Bahrein,” he acknowledged as valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty’s Government, and undertook in return for^ a guarantee of protection against aggressions “ by the Chiefs and Iribes of the Gulf” to abstain from maritime aggression, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c., and to agree to certain conditions in regard to residence and trade in Bahrein by British subjects and to jurisdiction over them. One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrah, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have disappeared from Bahrein before the Resident’s arrival. The Persian authorities at Bushire in June 1861 asked the Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Pier Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61. 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly through out this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Sub sequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861 No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty’s Government as _ to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The 1 ersian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled.

Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867). 75. In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as his islands were concerned, and that the annual tribute of 4,000 dollars “which he indubitably paid ” (cp. paragraph 5G above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the Lor I 89° P a y ment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government of India, in the light of the Resident’s investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent of all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar. 76. This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty’s Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. Investigation showed that the tribute still paid (1867) by the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Summary, 1861-67.

Punitive Expedition of August—September 1868. 79. In 1868, consequent on an attack on Qatar by the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Government of India resolved to take disciplinary action against Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa. The Sheikh sent an agent to Bush ire to satisfy the Resident, but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh in August-September of that year. Before it reached Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her Majesty’s Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom. The expedition found it unnecessary to use any force, a full submission being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the Sheikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Resident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6th September 1868. The agreement was signed by “ Ali bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein.” It declared inter alia that “ Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent piratical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited ali claim to his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.” 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, which contains a detailed report on the course of events, makes no reference to any flying of the Persian flag by Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, November 1868. 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or Pondou. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which are quoted below, the action of the Government of India drew a vigorous protest from the Persian Government, ihe protest, after appealing to the treaties concluded between England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 funratified) and in 1857, urged that the Resident, instead of respecting the rights of Persia in the Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties, had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia ; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor’s fort and house and caiised considerable damage ; had appointed the Sheikh s brother 2953 Bushire Desp. 3 of 25.9.1868.

The Foreign Office suggested, how ever, that it might be advisable, in the event of similar proceedings again becoming necessary, ^.d 30 ^™ 11111 ^ ° should be had with that Government. Vvhile this question was still under consideration a formal protest against the Resident’s action was received (11th February 1869) from the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London, who complained, inter alia, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his palace on which the Persian flag flew, and requested that the British Govern ment would give orders for the repair of the damage caused. He was informed in reply that “the Sheikh of Bahrein was an independent chief with whom the British Government had treaty engagements and whom they must hold stricdy to the performance of those engagements. O O nTL : _ ^ 4-4-4-L-»/-v I—'n and in support of his view he forwarded letters addressed “ from 1858 to 1869 by the Sheikh of Bahrein to His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz.” The translations of these letters are dated 9th April and 12th April 1869 respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written in 1860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Mehdi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that “ the slight neglect which was lately shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty’s Government was because they had not for a while superin tended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs here, I, with my brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty’s Government, being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,” and add “ . . . I will hasten to hoist the flag on my residence bearing the Lion and the Sun which are the signs of the Persian Standard.” nmisn note oi aytn April 1869. 84. The question of the reply to be given to this furtb protest was carefully considered between the India Ofh and the Foreign Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secreta of State for India, remarked thtft although he was of opini, that the line of policy which had hitherto been pursm of regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an ipdepende sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the right sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 184 1848 and I860, could not now be abandoned without ve serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, yet tb he was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all Cf of unnecessary irritation at the Court of Tehran and13 23 he was will mg, therefore, should Lord Clarendon desire it as a matter of courtesy to the Persian Government, to issue instructions o the Government of India to direct the Resident in the Persian Gulf (whenever he might on any future occasion, under orders from India, be about to call le Chief of Bahrein to account for any breach of his engane- ments with the British Government) to notify the fact to the ntish Minister at ..ehran for the information of the Shah’s oyernment. ^ Circumstances might, however, arise in which the Resident might, in the general interests of peace and order, be called upon to act promptly on his own responsibility, and in such cases the Secretary of State was not willing to waive what he considered “ as not only a right pertaining to, but a duty incumbent upon, the British Government. ’ The Foreign Office concurred in these views ana the Persian representative was informed accordingly. 85. The Persian representative on receipt of the Foreign Office letter asked that in order to make it more palatable to the Shah, certain modifications should be made in it. After private discussion between Lord Clarendon and the Duke of Argyll, of which no record exists, and an interview between the Envoy and Lord Clarendon, it was finally agreed to accept the modification embodied in the opening para graph of the letter which follows, but also to make the addition contained in the last paragraph of that letter ; and a letter so amended was despatched to him. The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government in support of their claim that Her Majesty’s Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as follows. The sentences in italics are those which were added in deference to the further representations from General Mohsin Khan referred to above : — “ The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has 'protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British Authorities, and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are un doubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes of pi eventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty’s Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that m those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. “ I need scarcelv assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty’s Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah ; and, in this question, I have tlmhonour to yate‘o you that, whenever it is practicable to do so, Her J 3 Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any -e-^^fgh^htf ao-ainst himself which the conduct of the blieikli ol hr pin mav have rendered necessary. j i „ “ But the British Government cannot consent o e a its oMcers, to whom the superintendence of the police oj To Gen.

Ihe ruling Sheikh Ali was defeated and killed,'while Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah assumed the leadership of the usurping party. 87. Her Majesty’s Minister reported on 14th Kovember 1869 a conversation on this incident with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which the latter admitted that Persia had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Gulf to enable her to repress acts of piracy and to maintain older, but added that he hoped that before long the Shah’s authority would be fully established at Bahrein, when full redress would be given for losses suffered through the recent events, and that in the meanwhile it would not be considered necessary that the British authorities should undertake coercive measures. Her Majesty’s Minister further reported that “ Ali bin Khalifa having forwarded letters to this Court admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government,” an agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan, who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (para graph 67 above)) had been despatched with a Royal Firman, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein, but that on receipt of the news of the murder of the Sheikh by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Firman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars). British Punitive Expedition (November—December 1869). 88. Punitive operations consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were undertaken by the British Government in November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to be “ to call the chief now in possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the maritime peace and for the attack on Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.” 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification in question stated that the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who had, he said, been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was in fact incorrect); that the Resident’s action would therefore be useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he would be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land in order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would request the British Government to send a naval force to nut affairs m order “ but up till now the state of affairs in Bahrein had not fallen into disorder.” 90.

The messenger was, however on his arrival prevented by the Resident from landing or communicating with the Sheikh, and his letters were Bushire detained and ultimately handed by the Resident to Sheikh Desp. 216 of Mohammed bin Abdullah after the submission of that 15.1^.1869.

The messenger stated that he had himself no authority from the Shah’s Government and was deputed by the Chief of Dayer, who was acting in obedience to Mirza Mehdi Khan. Submission of Usurping Sheikhs. Sheikh Isa bin Ali becomes Sheikh. 91. The punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah in September 1869. It may be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, how ever, rejected, with a view to securing recognition by His Majesty’s Government. He also appealed to the Wahabi Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin Ali, son of the murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the vacant Chiefship and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India (“ in no way did Colonel Pelly influence the, succession ”) and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly after his installation the new Sheikh received a letter from one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Dashti district on the Persian coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah’s protection, but the incident appears to have been unim portant. Persian Protest, 1869-70. Views of Government of India. 92. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh with equanimity and is said to have remarked that Persia and Great Britain had an equal interest in the maintenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident’s action m preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a still stronger protest was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Govern ment of India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident’s action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that his_ Government had nevertheless encouraged the piratical faction m the i ersian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the pirancal leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chie Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that e had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged^to t^ 7 p B gtr branch of the ruling family, and so had neithei G g ^ possession claim to this title; and that, so . ,| ie Shah having any just cause ot complaint a .

Suvvlementary Reports by Her Majesty's Minister, Tehran, April 1870. 94. On 6th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India : — “ In my Despatch No. 81 ... I reported that the Firman of appointment was originally m the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of . . . one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Md. bin Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman Avas issued in the name of the Persian Governor of.Fars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. “ With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me from a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Minister’s) possession. It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspon dence which passed last April betAveen Her Maiesty’s Government and the Shah’s representative in London, the 1 ersian Ministers, believing that the Bahrein Chief was himself well disposed to further their designs, resolved to take measures with a view to establishing,’ if possible, the Shah’s authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Mirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to carry out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authonties m Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Md. bin Abdullah, conferring■ 1 m 27 i p °n him the government of Bahrein and with this he Khan hoped to be able to come to terms with the Chief then in possession of the place. But in this matter the sole object of all concerned would seem to has e been to carry out the policy of the Persian Govern- inent at .rf lre , 1 T n . Wlt ^ 0ut reference to the interests or wishes of Her Majesty s Government in that quarter.” ^ n Sth April 1870 the Minister at Tehran addressed the loiiowing despatch to the Government of India : . &lt;£ reference to my despatch of the 6th instant, in which I stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had mfoimed me that Ah bin Ivhalifa had lepeatedly made overtures to Persia admitting his allegiance to the Shah, X have the honour to report to Your Excellency that Mirza bayed Khan has just sent to inform me that he was mistaken in making this assertion, and that he finds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin IThalifa.” Views of Government of India, May 1870. 96. The Government of India, commenting on these facts, remarked that Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Tehran with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. “At the capital no more definite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the Sheikh’s assumed right of sovereignty over the island.” 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had in fact now been brought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). “ This (i.e. the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston in 1851 and in our opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times ^of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such preten sions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one’which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to D 2 g Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to of 20.5.1870. the British Government.” Review of Discussions of 1868-70. 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspondence summarised above it will be seen m the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ah bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the I ersian ag was fly g ;“ h .*d:r; merries i»S j .i™» restoration Secoa y, office ^ of Her Majesty s Note sent by t p g ian Charge d’Affaires on 29th April Government to afford some justification for 1869 were widely ^ and wllile the the interpretatio ph confirme d in their view by the Persians may f™'' , „ Maiesty’s Minister against absence o “y fm Khan, the terms of that Note do not, C fact constitute more than a recogmtron thataccordance wim luc , - Treaties of 1820 ami 1861 with Bahrein) for their piratical attack on Bahrein and murder of the Chief placed in power there by the British Government.

In January 1870 a protest was received from the Turkish Government against the recent _ actions of the F.O. to I.O., Resident at Bahrein. In reply the Turkish Government ^si'bto 0 ’ were i n ^ ormecl that ^ er Majesty’s Government could not Lor.

In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty’s Government for their advice and their protection against the Turks in Lor.

Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger ' m Bahrein in August or September 1871, the Turkish (government demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and received a conciliatory reply. On their demand being pressed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested that the matter be arranged between the British and the Turkish Governments, by whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty’s Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved’. The Turks, however, let the matter drop. . The incident is of some interest as illustrating the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. 104. In August 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings in regard to Bahrein and the commission of “acts of sovereignty ” on F.O. to the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed in Turkish reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by him and that his Government might rest assured that it was Hertslet 30 not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to interfere in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed Jq° 7 upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace in the waters. The Ambassador was finally informed in April 1873, after investigation, that there were no grounds what ever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident in Basra, the Turkish Ambassador in London was referred to the British Notes of 1851 and .1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Majesty’s Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack being made on the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming Turkish protection, the Ambassador at Constan tinople handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour' that Her Majesty’s Government were forti fying Bahrein led to representations from Turkey. The Lor. h 914 rumour was unfounded and the Turks were so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks Lor - x &gt; 915 - themselves contemplated building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned. 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107 In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels of 1869. Her Majesty’s Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Lor. 1,915.

The Turkish claim was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty s Government. The Persian claim appears to have been dormant. Her Majesty’s Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed “ acts of sovereignty ” and^ continue to express their view that the Sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. XI.—1880-92. From the conclusion of the First to the conclusion of the Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. Persian Demarche, 1886. 110. In September 1886 the Shah sent a verbal message to Her Majesty’s Government through the Minister at Tehran that he considered the communication made to him in April 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights in Bahrein and that he was anxious to establish his authority effectually over the islands either by sending a Governor to Bahrein or possibly by recognising the Sheikh as representative of Persian authority, but that he wished the maritime police to remain in the hands of the British authorities. An answer was prepared by Her Majesty’s Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty’s interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty engage ments with the Sheikh, whom they considered to be indepen dent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. ^ 111. In the same year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Lar to the Sheikh w^ere returned to the sender.

In November 1892 the Ottoman Government were Const.

In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land Turkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty’s ships. Summary, 1880-92. 116. The Turkish claim was again pressed vigorously during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty’s Government. The Shah raised the question of the Persian claim in 1886, but did not press the matter. In 1892 the Sheikh entered into his Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. XII.—1892-1913.

The views of Pier Majesty’s Government on the status of the island were again officially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection, 118.

Teh. Desp. No. 140 of 18.9.1901. 120. On 31st August 1901 a Belgian customs official in the service of the Persian Government visited Bahrein, where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shall to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once made by His Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Government, in the course of which Sir A. llatdinge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf “ of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protection and bound by special treaties, of which the Persian Government _ cannot be ignorant, to the Government of India ... It is my duty to place on record in the clearest manner that His Majesty the Emperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrein . . . and that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.” The Attabeg- i-Azam, in a note received on the I7th September 1901, replied : “ As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.” 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Persians and on German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty’s Government would take action on their behalf. The text of their telegram was as follows : 14 To the Merchants and traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Con sultations with the English Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly he settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders will receive their proper punishment.” 122.

On the 19th hebraary 190b, m reply to a further reiteration which appears to have been based on the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 185/ the Minister at Tehran informed the Persian ig9 1 Q 06 Government that “ The Treaties of 1809, of 1814 and of 1 1 ° 6 ' 185/ on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, feuch a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty’s Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. I am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein.” The Note concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance in 1904—05 and quoted m extenso the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. 125. On 13th September 1906 the Persian Grand Vizier revived the Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain Bruce’s unauthorised agreement of 1822. He was reminded in reply that that agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty’s Government and that Captain Bruce had been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier’s attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself had “ refused to recognise ” the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822, which had never been ratified, and had “ expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.” 126. On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907, his attention was drawn in a Note dated 13th August 1907 to the Notes referred to in the preceding paragraph; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty’s Government and by the Shah. The Note added that “since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Govern ment, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.” 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah, intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah that reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty s Minister would admit that “ the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed ” The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A modified version was sub sequently accepted by His Majesty’s Government, which was acknowledged by a Note from His Majesty s Minister, 2953 Teh. Desp. No. 3 of 3.1.1907. Teh. Desp.

In J uiy ot the same year it was reported that internal Persian coastal passes issued to persons proceeding to Bahrein from I ersian ports were vise by a Persian merchant residing m Bahrein. In 1912 the individual in question was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by Persian subjects for travelling in Bahrein. The endorse ments in question were, however, henceforth granted by the Political Resident—a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident nine years later, “ of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian r»ort to persons Sfoino- to Bahrein. Withdrawal of Turkish Claim to Bahrein in Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913. 129. On 29th July 1913 His Majesty’s Government signed a convention (which still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Govern ment. under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised. His Majesty’s Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. The Turkish Government on their side accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. This arrangement, followed, as it was, by the disappearance of Turkey from the Gulf after tlm \\ ar of 1914-18, disposed of the Turkish claim to Bahrein, wffiich had been reasserted on numerous occasions and with great insistence since 1847. viuumary, loyz-iyiq. 130.

Since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council. 132 ; The Sheikh, on 14th May 1914, undertook not to entertain any overtures for an oil concession save after consultation with the Political Agent and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government.

In 1922 His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representa tions being made by the Minister at Tehran instructions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire stated that while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion in the Majliss on the desirability of giving Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parlia ment, which was referred to a Commission for report, His Majesty’s Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (paragraph 124 above). Owino- to the difficult internal situation in Persia this proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian Government was informed that the island was now a Butish protectorate, and that His Majesty’s Government did not •contemplate any alteration of its status. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Government ol which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. But despite this statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question in the following month. PLis Majesty’s Government remove^ Sheikh Isa for Misgovernment (1923). m Consequent on the gross misgovernment of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty’s Government of his contiol of affairs^n Bahrein on 26th May 1923, and was granted an allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (vyhose right of s, '. c ' ces ®'° 1 1 l had been ’recognised by His Majesty’s Government in WO ) being appointed to act for him as his fathers lu y empowered agent.

Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November 1927 from the Persian Government, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations. Ilie Persian protest was based essential!} 7 ' on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in Lord Clarendon’s Note of 29th April 1869 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the 1 ersian Note was despatched by His Majesty’s Government on 18th January 1928, and circulated to the League. While avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis, His Majesty’s Government in their Note- repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated that no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April 1869. Attitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928). 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia’s claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty’s Government in accordance with their treaties “ to defend Bahrein from outside inter ference ” and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler, and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. Further Persian Protest, 2nd August 1928. 140. On the 2nd August 1928 the Persian Government communicated a lengthy and reasoned reply to the British Note of 18th January 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Persian claim on the principle that territory belonging to a sovereign State could definitely be detached from that State only with the consent of the State in question, which had not been given in the case of Bahrein ; and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were con clusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His Majesty’s Government; that Bahrein had consistently recognised Persian sovereignty, as could be proved by documentary evidence, up to the date when the Sheikhs were instigated to rebellion by a foreign government; that no vahd argument could be founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty’s Govern ment, since their action had been without the approval of their suzerain; that the relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian .claim had been con- 3i et £tl.y a,,d uninterrupted!} pressed ; and finally that even f the Preaty of 18^2 w^as disavowed by His Majesty’s Government, it was material evidence of the view held by a British officer of F eat experience at the time of its con clusion and that its disavowal by the then Shah of Persia xs ires. o ' -»“* - -»- ^ .cr, 141.

Discussions between His Majesty’s Government and Persia 1928-34. 143. Between 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations, with a view to the conclusion pi a general treaty which should dispose of outstanding points of difference, were in progress with 1 eisia, the question of Bahrein figuring prominently in those negotiations. The general attitude taken by the Persians was that Bahrein was a point of great importance to them, hut that m return for a sufficient quid pTo quo they would be prepared to abandon their claims. His Majesty’s Government on their side consistently maintained that the Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladly see it finally disposed of as part of a general settlement, they would not be prepared to make any specific concession in return for its abandonment. Various formula! were worked out in discussion between His Majesty’s Representatives in Tehran and the representatives of the Persian Government with a view to an agreed solution. The negotiations have, however, failed to reach any conclusion and are at the moment suspended without any prospect of early resumption. 144. In 1932 the Persian Government protested to His p - z - 4902/33 Majesty’s Government against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged “ Bahrein,” and repeated their protest to the League. Their protest was rejected by His Majesty’s Government, and the stamps issued in August 1933. On 22nd May 1934 a further protest against the operation of the Bahrein oil concession was addressed by P.Z. 4343/34 the Persian Government to the United States Minister at Tehran, the United States Goverumeut and His Majesty’s Government, and copies were circulated at the request of Persia to the League of Nations. His Majesty’s Government propose to reply to this communication in a Note drawing attention to their Notes of January 1928 and February 1929 and to request the League of Nations to circulate this reply to the States Members of the League. XIV.—Conclusion. 145. It may be convenient in concluding this memoran dum on the recent history of Bahrein to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over the island wliich have been advanced by various countries since 1783 ; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any _ importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty s Government. A Claims to or Assertions of Sovereignty over Bahrein, 1873 to 1934. 145 ^—( a ) Muscat .—Bahrein subject to Muscat 1800-01, 1811 ? to 1810, 1820-22.

The claims of the Amirs disappeared with Z conquest of Hasa by Turkey in 1871. _ (d) Turkey.— The islands have never m the period subse quent to 1783 been occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents nf 1860-61 (paragraphs 67-9 above) are ignored) subject to Turkish sovereignty. But Turkish claims to them were advanced directly or indirectly, in 1847, 18ol, 18 &lt;0, 18*4, 1875 1876, 1379* 1888, 1892, 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1905, and on each occasion, save in 1847, when certain assurances were given by Turkey (paragraph 52), were rejected by the British Government. The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the vrraa r»nrvfirm«ri t&gt;v Artiplfi 16 of the Treatv of Lausanne of 1923. (e) Persia .—The Persian claim has been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period in question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a Persian envoy and apparently appealed for help to Tehran. They again momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein in 1860-61, while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869,1886, 1901, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1910, 1927, 1928, 1.930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by His Majesty’s Government in 1822 (as part of their refusal to accept Captain Bruce’s Treaty), 1825, 1844,1848, 1861,1862, 1866-67,1869, 1901,1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, 1929, 1933 and 1934. ’ B.—Basis oi the Persian Claim. u 147 / goring contentions such as that the use of the term ersian Gulf is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf, Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below :— (1) History of the Islands 'prior to 1783. The history tf the islands prior to the expulsion of th Persians in 1,83 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 abov. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning c the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of contn nrL m mvh’ and P artloular that during the 30 yeai On the nLfl^T f 01 WaS ° f a raore definite characte: . p !' -’ t le hicts recorded above do not suppo: of ''the islands 61813 t0 aU unmterru P te d occupation or con to39 Persia has on various occasions m i -■ the enrlv hixtnw nf TtoK, • • tlle P ast appealed to tne early History ot Bahrein m support of her claim that U is^ historically Persian territory. Since 1930, too certain Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at considerable ength with the history of Bahrein in the more oi less remote past, and have supported their statements by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian geographers or historians. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible to check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate researches into the writings of Arab geographers and others iiom which further information might he secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to 1783 is at most only of very indirect importance in the present connection. The essential weakness in the Persian claim is, it is suggested, that there has been no effective exercise of authority in the islands by Persia since her expulsion in 1/83, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title, based on an uninterrupted occupation of 1/30 years by the present ruling family. (2) The Absence of Persian Consent to the Detachment of Bahrain from Persia. The Persian Government, in paragraph 2 of their Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B), invited attention to “the following international juridical principle. ... A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.” They added (correctly) that Persia has-never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. The argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February 1929 in reply to the Persian Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B). His Majesty’s Govern ment expressed their inability to agree that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that temtory of its independence, “ and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the pro position that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia and during wnicli no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the 1 ersian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence. n paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty s Government cite historical precedents to show that the theory o ie necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1822. The circumstances in which the Treaty oi ^ concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the 'Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out m paragraph above? As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it withoutthe authority of or reference to Government, m treaty into which he had entered was immediately olfauall) am ^owed and the Persian Government so informed, and Pfmtain Brace as a sign of disapproval ol his action, vas removed from’his appointment. The Persian Gorernmen on their side equally disapproved the action of the 1 rince Governor of Pars in entering into any ^' SC p“^ without the prior approval of the &amp;hah [1U le _ Government were reminded of this m l82o,134j, _ Le , 1907 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible in these circum stances to base any legitimate claim to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein on the provisions of the ireaty oi 18-,-.. The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at W T&gt; 7 *. 1017 Please see paragraph 47 above. _ A Persian Mission appears to have 'visited Bahrein m 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above] and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion^ On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck elsewhere, though with an indication that it had been minted at Bahrein. The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more sub stantial character. (5) Payment of Peeshkesh, Offerings or Tribute at various Stages by Bahrein to Persia. From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the rulers of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in I860 to the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Shell remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein “ had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to I ersia aB a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection''] and the comment thereon of the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company that “ presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia ” are also relevant. V D ; vtying oj tne Persian b'iag by (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein m l860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above hardly had it been hoisted when, on the arrival of a lurkish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flao- hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860-61 the Persian and Turkish flags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh It appears difficult m these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. {f ,J jp aoklressed by the Persian envoy in London to the foreign Office m February 18ti9 alleged that the lersian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifab and that the Lesident had in September 1868 bombarded the■UWII1HI Aitch.jXIII, No. v, 53. 42 never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government (cp. m this connection para graphs 102 and 110 above), and in stating that due consideration had been given in the past by Her Majesty s Government to the Persian claim it did not m any way admit that that claim was valid. The Note, indeed, con firmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. (b) The undertaking given by Her Majesty’s Government in the same correspondence to communicate in future with Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of Bahrein is prima facie consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty’s Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty’s Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this understanding, intimated to that Government the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to proceed at once against the “ Chief now in possession of Bahrein ” consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who ha^l been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. (9) Closeness of Relations at the present Day between Persia and Bahrein. The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to\ any recognition of Persian suzerainty (cp. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without founda tion. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 a 7 id 1857 between the British Government and Persia. 148. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, ersia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of S her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the Pntish Government in connection with her claim to ? er appe ^ 18 hased substantially 0 n the fact that hose treaties provide m certain circumstances for the evacuation of I ersian territory occupied by British troops, he relevant passages of the treaties are as follows * Maiestv s Cnw P re ^ im f' nar y Treaty of 1809 between His unTerLk not to”* , ‘ he Persian ^eminent pass throno-li P ' per .™ t ;m . v European force whatever to ports of tW In, f 1i ther . t .? wa T ^ 3 lD ? ia or towards the undertook “ in n'* 1 ^ ’ n2 ll e Eis Majesty’s Government shall invade theT ? nro P eai ? forces have invaded or Persia ” To. o£ His Majesty the King of or Then of h a s, * he Kin g of a force; and officers ” 81 ^ Wltp warlike ammunition . . . of BkSroops WrtvedT P Tr ed : 1 If a dete chment and, by the consent oThIs ^ Ind '? 1 . n the G' d f of Persia island of Karak or any of the p ri&gt;1 ? n Majesty, landed on the any manner nosse^ iiL ^ Persian ports, they shall not in date of these meifmikr! 1 :? 8 , ° f SUch places ’ and fr ° m ‘Ee rcese preliminary articles the said detachment shallAitch.

In fact, neither in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein ; while His Majesty’s Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majesty’s Government in 1906 in reply to a Persian Note which based the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties, “ the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty’s GoAmrnment, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty’sGovernment have never admitted the ownership or sove Such a claim is m their reignty of Persia over Bahrein, view entirely inadmissible. Review of the Persian Claim. 149 It is relevant in the first place that from 1847 to 101 ‘1 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was pressed with at let. e/dJir to the Persian claim, and that through much o that pXd Ae Turkish claim had a stronger practical iustification than can be claimed by Persia since a perm lone prior to 1783, in that Turkey was the suzerain of the adjoining^continental littoral of Arabia and held or preferred claims to both sides of the Gulf by which Bahrein ,s vhich m the early part or the established a enfolded. Moreover, Muscat, w 19th century on more than one occasion temporary control over Bahrein and drew tribute from it, was P deterred from urging its claims by force from 1829 onwards only by the attitude of His Majesty s Government, while the Wahabi Amirs brought effective pressure to bear on Bahrein and drew tribute from^ it, though latterly probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early part oi the 19th century, and desisted only with their subjugation by Turkey in 1870. Persia, in other words, was up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything.a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than 1 urkey. 150. These considerations, however, apart, the general effect of a review of the history of Bahrein over the last 150 years and of an examination of the specitic arguments put forward by Persia and referred to in paragraphs 147-8 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a Persian claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands. The geographical remoteness of the islands from Persia and the fact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of Persia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1783. Such incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag in 1860, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag in 1860-61, or the temporary tender of allegiance to Persia in 1799, 1816-17 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of or appeals to Persian power; and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted in paragraph 97 above, are relevant in this connection, as are the observa tions in paragraph 8 of the British A 1 ote to Persia of 18th February 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1783 Bahrein has at various dates been in a position to enter into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring States such as Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet Ali (paragraph 34) and His Majesty’s^Government on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject to Persian jurisdiction. A further point of some importance is the absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion of45 their accession, or of any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such occasions of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might be expected from a Sheikh who regarded himself as a vassal of Persia. Nor does any protest at the absence of any such formal acknowledgment appear at any time to have been made by Persia. 151. The correspondence of 1869-70, to which particular attention has been paid by Persia in the past, and which may be thought the strongest contention that Persia is in a position to put forward, may indeed be quoted as evidence of the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government at that period of the relation of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently loosely expressed to afford some justification for the construction which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government of India, passed without challenge in 1871 (paragraph 102); that a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, in 1.886 (paragraph 110); that at frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty’s Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above); that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (para graph 61 above); and that His Majesty’s Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 152. The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the early part of the past century, before their relations with Her Majesty’s Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to he adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom they were surrounded. But not only is it now almost three-quarters of a century since any appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia bv Bahrein, but the present Sheikh (like his predecessor) is' keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the lersian claim, to which he is most strongly opposed. C—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934. 153 From 1820 onwards His Majesty’s Government insistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers, rhev concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847 1861, 1868, 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence ^ ,r P on occasion by forcible methods ^ am * t ^ a ' len i* ■rom outside whether from Persia, Turkey, EgJP Wahabis.
