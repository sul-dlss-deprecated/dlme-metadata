I politely refused him this and told him that if he wanted 'to do that, I would take my bed back to the Fort and speik to Mr. -illison the B.C.A.C. Manager. The sentry, on hearing this, became excised aid started threatening me, saying that he had orders to search me by fore3 and that even to boat me. The two English .nen sitting in ohe i^ront tried their best to Make the sentry understand and change his attitude and let me pass, but to no avail. The sentry s warted abusing me and when told by the two S iglish men that I v/as the clerk y ^Agency, he said that he knew me well, that 1 was a conceited man and that he intended to insult me. He added that he *ould allow any other person to pass but not me.

Correspondence is sent and received by a host of British officials including political and consular agents and RAF officers.A telex sent by the Political Resident to the Government of India on 25 November 1940 reported that Italian radio broadcasts had claimed success in a bombing raid over Bahrain, accounting for recent reports of unidentified aircraft in the area (folio 6). A large part of the correspondence in the file concerns payments made by the crew of the B-17 Flying Fortress to local Arabs, who offered them water and assistance. The crew members gave an array of banknotes to one man, which staff at the Political Agency in Bahrain attempted to convert into rupees at the Eastern Bank (folio 38). Further correspondence relates to a complaint made by the clerk at the Agency in Sharjah, over abuse directed at him by staff from the RAF base in the town (folios 46-47).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000093#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
