Dated 25th May, 1918. Received at 1.0. 11 a .m., 26th. ft ($KI ,i'ft' X Secret. Your telegrair; of the 8th instant. Bunder Abhas Kerman road. As it appears undesirable to move telegraph line at present owing to congestion of traffic we think that telephone line should be constructed as soon as possible, transfer of telegraph line being deferred until traffic conditions peniii t» 'otTvIS' I i* s' /. With respect to the third paragraph of the Treasury 1 s letter it may be of interest to relate that the line, sonsidered to have been prematurely constructed, proved itself of great value within three months of its completion. The cable from Jask to Karachi became interrupted early in July last year and could not be repaired for over a month owing to an accident to one of the propellers of the '(TaUia' which replaced the 'Patrick Stewart' as cable ship while the latter was undergoing repair. During this interval the new line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman was used to form part of a telegraph circuit between India Mnd Mesopotamia and, by reason of its existence,prevented such a delay to telegraphic communication betv/een those countries as might have proved a serious inconvenience to imperial interests. I submit that the expenditure incurred on the line was to a large extent justified thereby. 2.. With respect to the last paragraph I infer that all future expenditure to be incurred on the proposed diversion of the line to another route is to be a debit to the budget of the South Persia Rifles but am doubtful if this applies to both the &lt; ,v* ; ''' • Indian and Home shares. So far ; the whole cost has been debited to the departmental budget though a moiety, as soon as the amount recoverable has been ascertained, is by agreement payable by the British Exchequer. . it remains therefore to be decided whether the Indian moiety of the expenditure already incurred^as well as that to be incurred / is to constitute a debit to the South Persia Rifles or to the departmental budget. Orders on this point are solicited. The raison d’etre of the Baft-Sirjan extension will cease with the completion of the pi*oposed diversion,' at present it connects the South Persia Rifles’ post at Saidabad (Sirjan) with the general telegraph system but when that post shall havebeen connected up by another route it is proposed to dismantle it. A credit will then be afforded for the value of the material recovered from it. The Persians having latterly refused to recognize or use the existing line from Bunder- Abbas to Kennan and the branch from Baft to Sirjan and having refused to accept the revenue derived therefrom and collected' by us on their behalf,**it is being accumulated at their credit until the^ come to a more reasonable frame of mind,- the debit to them of a portion of the cost,however equitable it may appear to be, is at the present time outside the range of practical politics. Should the line, as seems likely, have disappeared before the (Persians have changed their mind their participation in its cost would be rendered difficult of negotiation. Any such proposition may therefore, I submit, well be abandoned as unattainable both now and in the future. I suggest that the Government of India might now be informed that the British Treasury have agreed to share wiih India the cost of diverting the Kerman-Bunder Abbas telegraph line from the existing route to follow the new road. The Treasury were informed that this will cost about £20,000 on the assumption that the Bunder Abbas-Tarum-Saidabad (Sirjan) route would be adopted and the material on the existing line used again but should theV desire to adopt the Bunder Abbas-Tarum- Katru-Shahr-i-Babek-Rafsinjan route to Reman it would appear k to be necessary to revise the above estimate and the approach the Treasury again. Except iron telegraph posts, for which timber poses will be temporarily substituted, plenty of Material has in the interval been collected at Karachi and there is no longer any necessity to dismantle the existing line by sectionJ’as was originally proposed by %he Government of India, Accordingly^whatever route may eventually be adopted £ Katru is miles Hern, i has re ce been tructeo from Sm to the placeadopted,I propose to make such arrangements as will leave the old line standing until the new line is ready to take its place. Perhaps by that time it may turn out th&amp;t the former is of use where it stands and I therefore submit that ita fate should be left for further consideration. If it can be left standing it will obviously much facilitate the negotiations now in abeyance. The participation of Persia in the cost of constructing the proposed new lines could then be separately negotiated. I anticipate that in the future both lines will be required. In fact I advocated the connexion of trhe Bunder Abbas with Kerman and Shiraz by separate lines so long ago as January 1914, see P.W.91/14, and the 'opinion I then formed has been confirmed by subsequent events.

The construction of the road to Kerman is almost/Cntirely a question of Supply and Transport. The road passes through Wmiles of deserted or un inhabited country and even when it reaches inhabited country a little extra population introduced from outside would soon cause a famine. (1) Jetty for landing at Bandar Abbas .—As regards supply, the first essential is a means of getting supplies ashore at Bundar Abbas. The improve ment of existing stone pier is useless (it is in centre of the town) until approaches have been cleared, but it is thought possible to run up a temporary wooden jetty extending f mile from high water mark which will allow of unloading launches at half tide. This can be improved later. There is a rise and fall of 13 feet at spring tides and any extension beyond J mile will have to be made with iron screw piles, if it is to stand against wave action in storms. The site is half way between the town and Naiband opposite the site of build ings and barracks proposed for the South Persian Rifles. An Indent for materials for temporary jetty has been sent by wire, a copy of which is attached., (5) Provision will be mide for not more than 1,200 men employed on the road including labour and escort and 500 camels and 250 mules requiring forage. This number of animals will probably be reduced as hired transport is organised. The reserve of supplies at upcountry Depots which will be established at Shirinu and Abraar will be 3 weeks’ supplies for 800 men and 100 camels and 20 mules and horses. At the base the reserve to be maintained will be six weeks’ supplies for 1,200 men, 500 camels and 250 mules. The Supply Officer, Bandar Abbas, has agreed to establish this reserve and replenish it as drawn on by me for the upcountry depots. The cost of these rations will be debited to the South Persian Rifles by book transfer. (3) Transport .—To keep 750 men at work on the road up country in the first 80 miles with escorts amounting to 200 men and transport of 40 camels and 20 mules will need a caravan of 450 camels or mules carrying a load of 2 cwts. and some forage for the march. To this must be added 100 animals at the base and the above mentioned 60 at advanced depots plus 25 per cent, sick, etc., total 790, at first the caravan need not exceed 350 animals. 4 They can be provided as follows 10th Camel Corps at Bundar Abbas ... • •• ... 100 Hired camels ... ••• ... ••• ... 400 Mules from Shiraz .. ... ... ... 250 The mules from Shiraz are small Indian type with which Army Transport, carts can be used but which are not of much use as pack animals. (4) Mechanical Transport .—One or two large caravans often amounting to 1,000 animals are always on the road at the present time and they have cleared all grazing near the road (except for 100 miles) and if another 500 camels are put on the road for road work, they will soon have to rely largely on food they carry. It is therefore very important to change to mechanical transport as soon as the road is good enough. It should be possible to use light vans at slow speed up to 35 miles from Bundar Abbas within a few weeks and using four 7 cwts. box cars working out and back 35 to 50 miles a day, it will be possible to keep 500 men supplied. As the distance increases a further 8 vans will be required up to the 100th mile and a total of 28 vans will maintain a party working beyond Chagat Pass in the summer. This does not allow for carriage of materials and tools. As soon as the road is metalled it will be possible to put on motor lorries of 3 ton capacity, but this will certainly not be before 1919, owing to the water difficulty and the need for development of water supply along the route. In the meantime if 12 box cars are provided at once and 16 more in June 1918, present needs will be satisfied. s248Da ^ Tune of box ear required. -A* regards type of ran tt,e Ford Car is (5) Type of &gt;&gt; country as the wooden wheels fall to hits m the dry reputed unsuitable in t . ^ , ohassis shake to pieces , oyer the rough climate of Persia and the enpne and chassi^ sna^ ^ o{ ^ ^ be tracks.

Tf the tools for the road are supplied at this rate the working season will have^pasted* before'they arrive and there will be no possibility of getting a road through, this winter. (7 ) Laiott r and Zro««nor&lt;.-There is a fair supply of local labour of the lowest class obtainable at 13 annas a day in Bundar Abbas and 16 annas up hrroad awaylrom the towns. These rate/ have been fixed after some days boldine out against higher demands. The rates are high owing to the high value of silver which is the local medium of exchange. If rations are supplied the rate is reduced according to value of rations drawn The supply of skilled labour such as masons, carpenters, smiths and fitters, as well as hos ' e * “ or iamadars) of all kinds is very small. There are said to be M taeMayers in Bandar Abbas but no masons. The number of carpenters and smiths is niiglmible and bosses are almost unobtainable. The same remarks apply t Sport! There is plenty obtainable at from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 a day per ammal but there are few men with any idea of organization or discipline, no one n vet come forward to take up contracts for construction. Thereareaf ewme Who will supply materials but none who can undertake construction anon seems probable that all work will have to be done by daily labour. T be '6* ization for work is shown in the attached table and a list of appointmen to be filled is below. Some others in the table, it is hoped to fill with tempo rary men who have applied to Deputy Director of Works direct, or locally. Engineering — Staff sufficient at preseflfc. Vacancies will be filled from time required and as temporary men offer their services. Works— \ To organize local labour, the following are required One Subadar of Pioneers @ Rs. 300. One Indian Quartermaster's clerk @ Rs. 100. Two Jamadars—these men should be of the petty contractor's class, bf trade masons or carpenters, pay Rs. 100 to Rs. 200 a month. Six Mates—these should be of the mistri class each with a trade as m ^ on ^ carpenter or with knowledge and experience of labour on maKin? roads, pay Rs. 45 to Rs. 100 a mouth.

To recapitulate it is requested that:— (1) the materials required for pier may be provided at once, (2) the supplies in Persia for use of the road may be maintained at 2 months* rations for 1,200 men, 500 camels and 250 mules, (3) that 12 box cars to carry 7 cwts. be provided at once, of a more reliable make than Fords, with steel wheels and 30 Horse Power engines and a further 16 box cars be provided before June 1918, ' (4) that in place of 3 Ford cars on order for the road, 3 cars of better construction be provided in view of previous record of Ford cars in Persia, (5) that 50 Army Transport carts be provided for use with Mule Corps mules, (6) that appointment of K.

With regard to the point raised in the 2 nd paragraph of your letter, I am to observe that the negotiations referred to in Mr. Haines’s letter of the 14th September, 1917, No. P.W.2160, have been in abeyance since May, 1917, and that, political conditions in Persia being what they are, the prospects of an early resumption would appear to be remote. In these circumstances it seems neither necessary nor advisable to notify the Persian Government at the present stage of such modifications as may ultimatelyqBpNPV?*' ultimately have to be made ir&gt; the draft Agreement of last year. It will suffice, in the Secretary of State’s opinion, if a modified programme is presented to them, with such'explanations as may be thought desirable, ’when the time for resuming negotiations arrives. In any case, further action at Tehran could hardly be taken until the alignment of the new Bunder Abbas-Kerman road (and, consequently, of the telegraph) has been finally decided. You will have learned from the telegram of the Director, Persian Section, I.E.Telegraph Department, dated the 25th February last, of which a copy was communicated to the Foreign Office on the 22nd larch, that revised t proposals are likely to be submitted to His Majesty’s Government on this point.\ In any further communication on tMs subject, please quote so. 42595 /Vi/ 34 . and address, not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, Loudon, S.W.l. 19! 8 toiC Foreign Office ( karch E2nd, 1918.

I am to point out that work on the new align ment has already been undertaken and that the trans ference of the telegraph is an obvious military necessity. As regards the financial aspect of the question I am to explain that the work on the road was regarded as part of the executive operations of the Sofcth Persia Rifles and as being included in the budget of that force.

Alignment for branch road to birjan was also examined and it appears very natural thus avoiding present difficult section Clakum Hajiabad. stop From Katru road would, run north east to bhari Babek Rafsinjan and Kerman thereby avoiding all high passes and kavirs. stop. A branch raad would run from north to Sirjan while during greater part of year present temporary road would be open. stop.

As selected alignment is still under consideration do instructions contained in your telegrams of the 18th, 20 th, and 21 st February still hold good, query. Under concumstances how before us had not we better sit tight pending final decision regarding selected route and instruct J. 3 .Smith to proceed to !Herman, query, it is difficult for me to give the information asked for till I know what the exact distance is via the realign ment; perhaps Sir P.Sykes might be asked to state what the total distance would be along route which the telegraph line and telephone line would have to be constructed, i take it the realign ment would be via Tangi Sadr, Tarum, Talhalal, Katru Shahri Babek Rafsinjan to Kerman, stop. It has doubtless been noticed thatsaving of 100 miles in the journey from Buhder Abbas to Shiraz by the adoption of the Talhalal route will -mean tfeart practically a correspondi ng increase in distance via that route from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, stop. Present route followed by telegraph line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman is 260 miles and so far as I can make out the detour via Tarum Katra and Shahri Babek through Rafsinjan to Kerman cannot be less than 300 miles.TiujjLGRAiu ■345 FROM VICEROY 24th January 1918.

South Persian Rifles. Estimate of expenditure for current year has just been received from local financial adviser, hut has not yet been examined. According to a telegram received from him, expenditure in current year is estimated at Rs. 276 lakhs at an approximate rate of one toman to Rs. 5|. Final scheme of organisation of force, lately received from Sir Percy Sykes and now under our consideration, on the other hand puts probable amount of expenditure, in the first year at ' 3,564,000 tomans, which at the same rate would amount to Rs. 187 lakhs. Out of difference of Rs. 89 lakhs between two figures, Rs. 47 lakhs is explained by larger provision in financial adviser’s estimate for unforeseen expenditure; but it is not possible for us to decide on arrangement for latter provision until we have examined detailed estimates. 2. In compliance with request previously received from you, we hope shortly to communicate our views on details of Sykes’ latest scheme of organisation. Before doing so we shall be glad to receive your orders on the question of incidence of expenditure (vide our telegram of 8th June, No. 277 A). This matter is one of great importance in view of heavy expenditure involved, and inter alia materially affects our ways and means calculation. As we shall shortly have to frame our forecast for next year, we request very early decision of His Majesty’s Government on this question, From Viceroy, Finance Department, Mih December 1917. Your telegram of the 3rd instant. Seistan levies. Amended statements of secret service payments are being despatched to India Office by next mail. As regards the levies, no accurate information is immediately available as to expenditure up to date, or as to estimated cost in future, but this will be sent as soon as possible. It is hoped that the delay in furnishing exact information as to cost levied in Fast Persia will not render it necessary to ' postpone decision of urgent question of incidence of cost of South Persian Rifles about which you have been recently again addressed by telegraph. ; : [P 4945 l' rom Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 21 th December 1917.

As regards incidence 1 have not felt able to accept in entirety views of your financial advisers as communicated in your Finance Department telegram of 8th June. I agree that British Exchequer should bear whole cost of Seistan Levies and.

My telegram, 229-S., of 21 st February, Bandar Abbas-Kerman road. Rich bavmgnow examined vanous main rontes, is confirmed in his opinion that route via ang i-Zagh and Saidabad, length 335 miles, most suitable both for temporary ^7’“ &lt; 6 )&gt; of “ Instructions for icfi ir’i, C ° Py f0I ; Wf : rded Wltl1 Forei gn Secretary’s weekly letter No. 14-M., dated 16th February. Sykes agrees. LJ&gt;h/. Rich’s approximate estimates are as follows {a) No existing route can be improved sufficiently to convey cars up to Kerman under cost of 5j lacs. For this sum as absolute minimum temporary road for occasional motors can be constructed, but ex penditure up to nine lacs is strongly recommended as it would render whole road much more serviceable and good enough for light continu ous traffic at a slow pace. (b) For permanent motor lorry traffic estimate for road partly metalled is 44J lacs or fully metalled throughout 58 lacs. Our experience with the Nushki-Sistan road renders us averse to large expendi ture on a long mechanical transport road through waterless country, and we there fore do not recommend (6). Sykes draws his supplies chiefly from local sources, and convoys from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz go by Lar, so that so far as Fars is concerned Rich’s road (a) is of no value. As regards Kerman, since Rich received his orders, the strategical and political situation has improved in this district, so that the immediate urgency of the road is not so great. On the other hand without it reliance must be placed solely on pack transport, which is sometimes difficult to collect. r Eventually we may require railway connection between Bandar Abbas and Kerman and Rich reports his route as feasible for a railway alignment. 2. Please send orders urgently as to whether the road is to be constructed and, if so, on what scale. Construction, if ordered, should start immediately to enable road to be completed before next hot weather, and the following staff will be required for construction either of temporary or permanent road :— Europeans. 1 Engineer in charge, with 3 Assistants. 1 European accountant. Indians. 6 Sub-overseers. 2 Surveyors. 1 Head clerk. 1 Store clerk. 1 Draftsman. 4 Junior clerks. 800 Coolies. We recommend any work ordered be carried out directly under orders of Government of India as all personnel and material must be supplied from India. 3. Expenditure is in our opinion directly connected with military operations in South Persia and should be debited wholly to His Majesty’s Government; please see our telegram No. 277-A., dated the 8 th June 1917.Telegram P., No. 717-S., dated Simla, the 19th June 1917.

Three convoys by this road left Bandar Abbas April 13th, May 5th and May 8 th, respec tively, and all three dumped stores at Lar. Transport had to be sent from Shiraz and first part of this reached Shiraz June 22nd, remainder being due next two days. Lar road was used as experiment while Kawam was in that district and water-supply between Bandar Abbas and Laris precarious from cisterns. Parties of troops and stores requiring escort must use Tamm and Saidabad and Niriz road. Alignment being examined between Aliabad Katru track can be probably m,ade easily with loca labour thus giving shorter direct road between Tamm and Niriz. Rich s road therefore is of value to Ears.

Reference:—The Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road. I have the honour to send my proposals as to the final report and plans, etc. 1 . I propose to write a final report giving description and estimate of route 144 which I have already reported to be the best route. In addition I propose to give descriptions of routes 143 and 141 which I rejected, in case at any future time road or railway construction may he required along any portions of these routes. 2 . One inch road surveys have been completed along the whole lengths of these three routes totalling over 1,000 miles. This means a length of maps of 1,000 inches or 83 feet which will be too bulky to incorporate with the report. I therefore propose having these surveys reduced to 4 or 8 miles to an inch which will shew all the main features and attach them to the report. 3 . It will however be a waste of good material if these surveys on the larger scale are put aside and forgotten in the Survey of India offices ; I therefore propose drawing two sets of these surveys on tracing cloth on the one inch scale one set for the Railway Board and the other for the Foreign Office to send to the Secretary of State. 4 . The above proposals do not include any drawing the Surveyor General may require for incorporation in the Persia degree sheets which he can settle loiter 5 . Will you kindly inform me if you approve of these proposals or wish them modified in any way, after consulting the Railway Board, Military Works, and Foreign Office.

It is obvious that two routes cannot be protected except at prohibitive cost and as we are steadily strengthening our hold on Bunder Abbas Sirjan-Kerman route which has been selected by experts. It seems desirable that telegraph line should be transferred to selected route as was I think intention of Government of India. Director Tehran informed me that it would be cheaper to construct separate telephone line along new route but material is now very scarce and question would arise of protecting two separate lines. We are constantly moving troops along selected route and have forces at Tarum and Sirjan where posts are approaching completion; there are also troops at three points between Sirjan and Kerman.

I have now personally travelled over the whole of the three more direct routes, viz the eastern route 141 via Jiruft, the centre route 143 via the iang-1-Zmdan, and the western route 144, ma the Tang-i-Zagh and Saidabad. I have also travelled from Bandar Abbas along route 130 for 120 miles a. farasManujan (square, L sheet 25 E.) which il the ro^e chosen as mos suitable for railway construction. (Karachi Extension Survey, Volume III ) In addition to visiting the whole length of these three direct routes and part of the kigan route, 139, with a number of alternative tracks lyin^ adjacent to these routes, I have examined four of the tracks across the hills conn^ctin^ route 141 with route 143, as suggested _ by General Sykes, with a view to avoiding by a detour to the east the Tang-i-Zindan on route 143, vis. (&lt;z) Through the Tang-i-Mardan defile (square ~ sheet 24-H). (3) Over the Gudar-i-Buna pass (square ~ sheet 24 D).

I have also examined a direct route across the hills from route linear Ahmedi (square — sheet 25 -A) direct to Bandar Abbas the Zankuta Pass cniiarf , £ sheet 2 n-A.) with a view to avoiding the Tang-i-Zindan on the west, square § o * The distance I have personally travelled up to date over these routes since my report of 4th December, amounts to over 1,600 mi.es, of which '00 miles are non-effective, being return journeys over routes previously tra- veiled. This leaves 1,^00 miles of effective travelling, over the whole of which I have collected data for route reports and notes on the nature of ground, suffi cient for estimating road construction. If the 150 miles which I had travelled, prior to my last report, are added to the above total, it makes 1,/50 miles actually travelled up to date, of which 1,575 miles are effective. 2. The following routes still remain unvisited, viz. (а) A gap of 250 miles on the Rigan route 139, between Manujan and the connection of this route with route 141 at Tahrud (Square , sheet 24-G.). (б) An alternative alignment to the lower portion of the Tang-i-Zagh route 144, to the west from Guhra (square sheet 2 5^)» via Fin, (square 5 sheet 18M), meeting the route again at barzeh (square % sheet U) A variation of alternative (4) by going due south from Fin m-i Takhu (square § sheet 18M) and Tazian (square % sheet 25A) direct to Bandar Abbas. id) An alternative alignment from Sa’adatabad (squaresheet J/'F) on route 144 via Sarmand (square £ sheet 25A) to Kalakun (square \ sheet 25A; avoiding the Tang-i-Zagh. I do not propose to visit route (a), as the detour to the east^ is too great for the purpose of a military road, but I wall visit the alternative alignments (3), (c) and (^) on my return journey to Bandar Abbas in a few days time and will send you my report on them in the middle of May. Alignment («) will e very roundabout and as it goes through the hills, I do not anticipate that it wi have any advantages, in construction or cost, over the alignment through t e Tang-i-Zagh. I think that 4;he alternative alignment (f&gt;) will be slightly more costly, and also about 10 miles longer than the ordinary route from Guhra to Sarzeh via Gishan (square f sheet 25A), but it is most necessary for strategi cal purposes to have a military post at Fin, (square 5 sheet 18M), if route 144 is adopted, so that the alignment for this portion of the route via Fin seems preferable to that via Gishan. If the alternative (c) is found feasible from a construction point of view, it will be preferable to (£), as it w T ill eliminate the extra 10 miles of road, mention ed above, and military posts along it will hold all the routes near the sea, leading to Bandar Abbas from the west. I am doubtful, however, if the portion from Tazian to Bandar Abbas is feasible as, from the map, it appears to go over very broken ground, which would make the road construction much more costly than the alignment to the east via Chah Chakur (square | sheet 25A ) and Birkeh Tashtak (square f sheet 25-A). 3. With the exception of the routes mentioned in the preceding paragraph as still unvisited, l have now travelled over practically every possible route, both suitable and unsuitable, between Bandar Abbas and Kerman, and am therefore m a position to amplify, from personal observation, the note on the comparative merits of the four possible routes for a road, discussed in paragraph 12 (^) of my narrative report No. 105 of 4th December 1916. A full report on all these roads, giving descriptions in detail and estimates for road making will take a considerable time to compile, so cannot be submitted till after the completion of the work. f*Which make0Ut an f - route ,44 •39, whidi^hav^on^pa^tfy'^visited 0^ ' 7 *’ ^ I construction, followed by very rough’comparative estimates ol cost t0 rMd zgzz&amp;S! !$r.£ 4 S!«s ^ ^square ^ sheet 17F) and a detour to the east near Shila Haidar (square D sh^t- ^O) to ayoid the KaYir whieh is impassable for several days after ram and extends much further east than shown on the map, for which reasons Ilso Thave chosen a route to the east v,d the Chashma-i-Sufid pass (square of nPt in (s r qu e a r r e e n | e o t f 0 .7P). deSC ' bed ln the route book the Cfcah-T-Chafut pass the su' effs'compfeuf nCeS ^ 0n ' y a PP r0!i!mate and wil &gt; he corrected, when The gradients along this route are very easy the whole way. n^° m i,? an Q ar w baS tber , e 'f an lm P erc eptible rise for 62 miles to the Guhra pass he,ght 2,800) (square f sheet 25A) thence a descent for 3 miles to Guhra height 2,600 From Guhra, there is a gradual rise for ,8 miles to the Gudar-l’ Charg pass, height 3,700 (square * sheet 2 S A) whence there is a gradual descent for ts miles, through the 4 miles of the Tang-i-Zagh gorge and thence over open plains to Sa adatabad (height 2,800) (square ~ sheet 17P). ^ From Sa’adatabad to the Chasma-i-Sufid pass, height 6,000 (square ? sheet 17P), is a gradual rise for 72 miles, whence the ground descends imperceptibly over an open plain for 56 miles to Saidabad, height 5,500 (square ? sheet 17O)/ From Saidabad, there is an easy rise for 37 miles to the Khan-i-Surkh pass height 8,500 (square $ sheet 24C), whence the ground descends for 33 miles to Kiia Mashiz height 6,700 (square ° sheet 24C), followed by an easy ascent of 12 miles to the Gudar-i-Dukhtar pass, height 7,400.

The pass 10 miles N. ' 0 Nabid height 8,600 also is about 800 feet higher than the u Pass (square ® sheet 24G) on the route selected, which is only 7,800 and the road has no habitations, except two caravanserais, and one small village, for over 55 miles from Tahrud to Mahun. (e) From Rayin (square f sheet 24G) to Kerman via the Hanaka Pass (square f sheet 24G). This route is practically the same length as that chosen vid Bahramjird and has the disadvantage of crossing the high Hanaka Pass, height 8,700 feet, whicn is sometimes closed by snow during the winter months. Obstacles along the route. (a) The crossing of the Shur river (square ® sheet 25A) and the Jamugh river (square J sheet 25A). (b) The Gudar-i-Surkh Pass (square § sheet 25E) to which the approach from the west along a gorge, requiring 3 miles of rock cutting. The descent on the east is easy. (&lt;r) The Gudar-i-Shuran Pass (square § sheet 25E) with a very bad approach from the south for six miles, requiring 4 miles of rock cutting; the descent on the north is easy.V ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ i ^ I '* k 8 always be a source of trouble and recurrme e fP^ ns ®&gt; t0 the slldln g character of the rock faces. The crossing of the Hahl Rud Rwer on route ,41, as in the case of all rivers liable to sudden doods, will also be difficult to keep clear. In the final paragraph of my report No. 105 of 4th December, I gave the conclusions which seemed to indicate route .44 as the best strategy line for a g military road, provided the obstacles to road construction were not too great. 1 think a consideration of the descriptions of the three routes in paragraphs 4. c 6 and the estimates of cost in paragraph 7, conclusively prove, that the cost of constructing a road along route 144 will be very much the same as along route 141 and probably much cheaper than along route 143. The only drawback to route 144 is that it is slightly longer than route 141 and considerably longer than route 143, but this is no real disadvantage, as it passes through the important military centre of Saidabad and the n5 miles between Saidabad and Kerman would certainly require to be connected by a road in the near future, if either of the other routes were adopted in preference to route 144. I understand that Lieutenant-Colonel Orton and other officers who have studied the strategical question of the roads on the spot, agree with my views as to route 144. being the most suitable route to adopt from a purely military : point of view and the big merchants in Bandar Abbas and Kerman all state t at if this route is protected, they will send their caravans along it in preference to any other route, as was the case 10 years ago before ihe local raiders became f too strong. From the above considerations, I therefore have no hesitation whatever in recommending route 144 via the Tang-i Zagh and Saidabad, as the best ora military road irom Bandar Abbas to Kerman both from an engmeenng an a so from a military point of view as I have'already telegraphed to you in my No. 122 of 27th March (Dy. No. 20316). Position of rnili- 9. The general idea for the protection of the road is based on the tarv posts along aggm^ptjon that the South Persia Rifles will eventually have one battalion 0 route 144. | infantry with headquarters at Bandar Abbas, and three battalions ot infantry, one cavalry regiment and one mountain battery at Kerman In that case, the Bandar Abbas battalion would be responsible for the protec tion of the southern portion of the road frum Bandar Abbas to the south entrance of the Tang-i Zagh. a distance of 88 miles, whilst Kerman troops would protect the road from the north entrance of the Tang-i-Zagh to Saidabad and thence to Kerman, a distance of 253 miles. • Lieutenant-Colonel Orton made out a scheme for the positions and garrisons of the military posts required along the road, which are clearly shown on the trace sent herewith. The main idea is for the Bandar Abbas battalion to garrison five posts with 275 men, whilst one battalion and two squadrons from Kerman, with headquarters at Saidabad, garrison eight posts, from Saidabad southwards. The protection of the road between Saidabad and Kerman (where danger is not anticipated), would be maintained from Kerman by 10 or 15 men placed in each of the 5 carvan- serais along the road. 10. The direction from which attacks are most likely is from the west and on the trace, showing the positions of the military posts, l have also marke the routes which the tribes likely to give trouble, would follow. From north to south the main hostile tribes of whom about one-third ate mounted men, consist of :— (a) The Arab tribes centred on Niriz (square § sheet 17) wlt ^ a l )0Ut 4,000 rifles but short of ammunition.

On the other hand he says that, after taking soundings, he is of opinion that no pier can be built to the east of the present small stone pier in the centre of the town as the water is too she ving to the east but improves to the west. Unless, therefore the present small town P ,er ,s to be utilized for all future trade, any modem pier must be bmlt to the west of the town, on which side also the anchorage is believed to be better, as it is sheltered by Qishm island. If the pier is hkelv ! to be built to the west of the town, would it be advisable to have the town between the cantonment and future port which is sure to centre round the pier. If not, the cantonment would also have to be on the west or north west of the town near the port. ft d ' sadvanta « es , of having the cantonment on the west are that it is difficult to find a good site, as there is low lying cultivated land on that side with is^mwaterTupplt' 01 ^ eXCe ‘ lent breedin S S rounds for mosquitoes and there No T hl k has , a,read y bee ' wired toyoubythe Consul, Bandar Abbas in his No. 216, dated 29th March 1917.

If only a site for a detachment has to be chosen and not for a large cantonment, a suitable site may probably be found to the west if considered desirable.

Reference the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road, I have the honour to send herewith a further report in continuation of my No. 1 27-Confidential of 9th April 1917, giving an estimate for the construction of a temporary road to take occasional cars. ^ Your telegram No. 26652 of 24th April 1917, asking for estimate for construction of a temporary road, did not reach me till my arrival in Bandar Abbas on 13th May. If it had reached me earlier, I could have sent you a detailed report and estimate before the end of April. In my telegram No. 109* of 14th January, to which you refer in your * Diary No, 4124. No. 26652 of 24th April, I stated that “ l hoped to be able by means of local labour to clear the bad places enough to permit the cars now at Kerman, Hupmobilies, to go to Bandar Abbas by it”' In the following sentence, however* Colonel Orton’s telegram to you No. G.-i2f of 16th March stated that we + Diar ?

For this reason I did not send you any detailed estimate for a temporary road with my No. 127 of 9th April but only an estimate for a per manent road. The road subordinate, whom I asked to be sent to reach Bandar Abbas at the end of February and about whom you wired to me in your 9542 of 1 2th February, did not reach Bandar Abbas till the middle of March when I had left Bandar Abbas and was half way to Kerman. He only met me at the beginning of May on my return journey. His services have, therefore, been of no use to me up to date owing to his late arrival at Bandar Abbas. I have now sent him to Saidabad to assist Lieutenant Lowis in the construction of the upper portion of the road. I will shortly send you a report on the alternative alignment via Fin vide , D . my telegram 125$ of 5th April.

Marling. It will be observed that in Sir G. Marling&lt;s opinion action on the road in question may cause constant obstruction to British interests on the part of the Persian Government, particularly in connection with the south Persia Rifles. Mr. Balfour understands that one of the reasons for / which the Army Council attached importance to the construction of an improved road was for use in connection with the South Persia Rifles; and in these circumstances it appears to be a question whether the military advantages of the road will outweigh the possible political disadvantages that may arise from its construction.

If Kalbrikah eo.M &amp; h) (mn IM&lt;md of Aoril the following useful work in second section could be completed by them. Firstly in one week one company with explosives could eliminate 80-yard difficult nlace in Tang-i-Zagh for pack animals. Secondly—in one month Pioneer Battalion can construct a road fit for motor lorries between Tarum and Hapabad. In the first section nothing short of a permanent metalled road will be of any use for motor lorries and money would be wasted and the alignment probably spoiled if a temporary road in the first section were to be attempted. The conclusion is that during this summer a Pioneer Battalion can make a motor road between Saadatabad and Saidabad but that the first section of 83 miles can only be under taken next winter with the help of labour brought from India. It appears so obvious that this route must be adopted for the road that after consulting Major Rich, Major Grant, Major Farran, and Consul, Kerman, I have selected sites of posts for one battalion and two squadrons South Persia Rifles between Tang-i-Zagh and Saidabad and have drafted plans for these posts. The principal features are two big posts at Tarum and at Saidabad ea ch of which is allotted one complete squadron and also Headquarters of a half battalion and 80 per cent, of the half battalion, the remaining 20 per cent, rifles of _ each half battalion being allotted to small defensive posts along the road blocking all the chief communications from west to east. Offices for telegraph and for feouth Persia Pifles also store rooms and accommodation for petrol and motor spare sets are included in all post plans. These posts can be built chiefly with local labour and material and copies are held by Major Rich, who will include estimate for posts in his detailed estimate for the road. The work of building can best be done in summer, and building could proceed at the same time as the construction of the road. The final alignment of first section of the load has not yet been definitely chosen, and on his return journey Major Rich will examine alternative alignment between Bunder Abbas and Guhra passing west of Kuhihinau and via Pin which is said to be shorter and easier. Between Bunder Abbas and Tang-i-Zagh I have allotted tentatively posts for about a company altogether from the Bunder Abbas South Persia Rifles battalion as climate of first section is hot. Copies of all plans and details are being conveyed to Shiraz for your ultimate approval, but if you could see your way to giving your approval generally to Chief of the General Staff this very important work for the Kerman Province is likely to be hastened greatly and pending an early decision on these primary considerations affairs here are somewhat at a standstill. This information is required by Chief of the General Staff as early as possible and as your Staff Officer I am therefore taking all action possible which I feel you yourself would take had you been present here, but of course until you approve and notify your approval to Simla work will be deferred. Within about a month or six weeks Major Rich expects to complete all his surveys and estimates and take them with him to Simla. He expects to arrive at Kerman from Saidabad about the 31st of this month. Telegram P., No. G.-19, dated the 27th March 1917. From— Colonel Orton, Kerman, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Following telegram was sent to Daulatabad on 16th to you through Base Commandant and is now repeated:— Begins. G.- 12 , Hajiabad, March 16th. With regard to Bunder Abbas-Kerman road question, I have had a discussion with Major Rich here and have seen his report of 4th December to you and subse quent correspondence. There seems little doubt that railway should follow Minab- Rigan alignment. As regards Tang-i-Zagh-Saidabad alignment being best for mili tary road, I agree with Major Rich’s arguments. Though formidable, Tang-i-Zagir is only 4 miles in length and stream there has small catchment area. General he o country and gradients favour construction of permanent road but are so s f oa y that temporary road strongly deprecated as useless and waste of money.

From— Major Kick, Kerman, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Priority. Following is in continuation of my telegram No. 124;— This road follows route 144. It is intended now. to reconnoitre alternative route further west in a lower portion from Guhra in square A.-l map 25 -N,jut (Fin.) square D .-2 map 18-M. and Takhu square D-3 map 18-M.,_as it is be er, strategically, for intercepting raiders from west. If this alternative route oun feasible t is anticipated that it will be slightly more costly but extra cost wi outweighed by corresponding military advantage. When I reach Bunder middle of May, I will send you alternative estimate. However, esitunate a re ) given is near enough or the purpose of sanctioning construction. Reference my telegram No. 122, if road construction is to begin in sumine , it is advisable to send Pioneers, if they are available, to Saidabad immedia e y complete to Saidabad to Kerman, length 144 miles, during the summer, asi w very cold in winter, whereas the lower portion is too hot for summer wor • On completing this section, Pioneers would work south from Sa dabad t Tahrum, length 117 miles, finishing work by May 1918. Labour Corps 1,00 s epuld complete section from Bunder Abbas fo Tahrum, 110 m les, by Mayclaims right to adhere or dissent on military grounds. I venture on your criticism to submit the following remarks Firstly -I understand it is solely to assist South Persia Rifles in protecting road that telegraph has been undertaken. Two routes instead of one, will have to be protected, involving double trouble and expense, if line does not follow road. Secondly .—Along with telegraph via Tang-i-Zindan special telephone wire . has been laid. As telegraph material is very scarce cost of construction and expense of additional posts and wire for telegraphs ^ Bunder Abbas to Keman via Tang-i-Zagh and Saidabad, if obtainable, would be heavy. Thirdly Shif ing of line should not be more expensive than building of separate telephone line, we think. We also believe that, as part of Jask connection, first 40 miles of present line from Bunder Abbas will stand. Fourthly. —What has passed on the subject of this line between British and Persian Governments, I do not know, but it seems desirable line should be built as a military measure and be paid for and retained as British property if possible, and that in any case discussion of terms should be postponed pending the opening of line Of course Persian Government cannot be asked to pay for our mistakes, expense of which will be slight in relation to expenditure now being, and to be, incurred in Southern Persia by us. There seems to be no question of suspension—as Baft has not yet been opened -but only of a few months delay which might well have arisen from other causes. Fifthly.—Some sort of road to carry on with must be constructed at once and protected, whatever railway questions may be raised. Telegraph connection with Saidabad is immediately necessary in these circumstances, and, as stated m my telegram 56 and reaffirmed by you, can be best effected by a connection between Baft and Saidabad which need only be temporary. There is not enough material to connect both Kerman and Saidabad with Baft, Sixthly—In assuming Zindan route possible for motor road, serious mistake was made. I think we should frankly recognise this now and abandon it completely in order that ever after we may not be ex post facto. Seventhly ,—Railway, even if decided on, will presumably follow Rigan route, and would also probably not be completed for years. Necessity for maintaining order in Bunder Abbas and Western Kerman will not be eliminated, and necessity lor South Persia Rifles posts with telephone or telegraph will remain, Addressed Tehran; repeated Political, Basrah, Enclosure No. 2.

From e point of view therefore of the supply of material it appears immaterial to me whe er Kerman is connected with Baft via Saidabad or with Saidabad vm Baft. Your paragraph ( 1 ).—Telegraph line between Bunder Abbas and Kerman was mooted long before South Persian Rifles existed. The original reasons were that it would offer an alternative ipternational route and also give the f' ers1 ^ _ Government a route for internal telegrams to Bunder Abbas. Seeing that t e e e graph line will run at an average distance of less than 50 miles from the road, Persian Rifles should be able to protect it.

There is nfdoubt that T1 “ re wouH i - •”—/a On the other hand, if the Shiraz-Bushire road is re-opened and stores for Shiraz can be sent up to Shiraz from here, the congestion at’Bunder Abbas will isappear. Perhaps also there is not a Pioneer battalion to spare or the Govern ment of India may consider that all the Pioneer battalions can be more usefullv employed elsewhere. In these circumstances of course there would be no need for a special camel corps at Bunder Abbas. aI may mention that in view of the bad rains this cold season and the previous shortage of stocks, it is certain that there will be great scarcity all over Fars and Kerman. Consequently if a Pioneer battalion is sent, all or the greater part of the supplies for it will have to be sent from India : also no doubt all the grain and most of the fodder for the camel corps. In the circumstances it might possibly be better, though not so satisfactory of course, to employ local labour (as far as possible) to make the road, if it is sanc tioned. This would have the additional benefit of providing work for a large number of men who are otherwise likely to be in a semi-starving condition. Enclosure No. 4. Memorandum No. 507, dated the 7th April 1917. From— Mr. W. R. Howson, His Majesty’s Consul, Bunder Abbas, To—The Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf. If the Bunder Abbas-Saidabad-Kerman road is to be constructed I would strongly advise that Government be asked to detail at least one complete Camel Corps (1,000 strong) to transport the baggage and supplies of the working parties and material for the road. Trade had been greatly hampered by local transport being used in large numbers for the transport of troops and stores and there is the likelihood of a com plete break down of trade unless the strain is removed. The Customs premises are already congested and unless some of the goods are allowed to be transported to the interior the Customs Department will have no alternative but to refuse cargo altogether or else to store it in open, unprotected spaces. The 10th Camel Corps which is being raised here is only about 600 strong and out of this number over 300 accompanied the reinforcements to Shiraz and may be considered lost to Bunder Abbas as they are not likely to be returned.

If this should prove to be the case, an&amp;^as it seems probable, Russian policy towards this country at least for the immediate future will be materially altered or at least that we need not apprehend any aggression, I would call Your Lordship's consideration to ’whether we should not endeavour to re^ gain old confidence in British friendliness that existed before the conclusion of the 1907 Convention 0 Persians recognise quite well that that Convention was a defensive measure on our part and that in any coercive measures (and the August Agreement is regarded by them in that light) which the two Powers have subse quently taken our assent has been reluctant and I be lieve that a spontaneous offer to tear up the 1907 Con vention as far as it concerns Persia and to discuss again provisions of August Agreement would go far to rgeWEo' PV regain Lkj' Sg4L Dll r iegain for us esteem forfeited by them and by placing us again in the position of friendly advisers, afford the chance of persuading Persia to accept foreign help in setting her house in order.

Deoails of the various alignments for the proposea Bunder-Abbas-Kerman motor road are given in the printed correspondence on P.1086/17, flagged below. The route finally selected by Major Rich - that via Tang-i-Zagh and Saidabad - is the easternmost of the possible alignments and is discussed in paragraph 10 of Major Rich’s report of the 4th December last (pp. 11 - 12 of the printed correspondence), sir P, Sykes was at 0 x ^6 time opposed to the selection of this route, onmg to its proximity to the turbulent Baharlu country; but he has since modified his opinion of this point. Major Rich, on the other hand claims ior it the merit of being ’’the best route 'from which to control all the exits from the 'Baharlu country'. The improvement of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road up to a 'motorable' standard was recommended by Sir P. Sykes in his letter of 23M April, 1916 (flagged) mainly on the ground that, together with the proposed telegraph line (which has now been completed), it would 'do much for the cause of law and order in South East Persia' and would strengthen thehands of the South Persian Rifles, then in the early stages of formation. The proposal found support from the military authorities at home: see Major Steel’s Memorandum of 22nd July, 1916, forwarded with an expression of general concurrence by the C.I.G.S., in which the project was commended'-S' couraerided as calculated to 'strengthen our position ’very greatly’ 1 . The Government of India in their present_ telegram are rather half-hearted in their support of the scheme, and evidently do not regard tne improvement of the road as a work of really urgent necessity. In.these circumstances it seems very doubtful whether, in existing circumstances, the expenditure involved (£60,000 if the alternative recommended by the Government of India is adopted) ought to be incurred. But it is desirable to consult the '.’Jar Office (and also the Foreign Office) before deciding. The question of incidence of cost can be considered later, as proposed in the draft, in connection with the proposal to charge the whole cost of the South Persian Rifles to Imperial Revenues. ms h) ImmCuvU - J^(/&gt; (X%-^ /fr,U - \ i -« From Viceroy, 26th/June 1917.

Discussion of question of incidence of levies employed in Eastern leisia has led us to reconsider the question of incidence of South Persia Rifles. Our Auditor-General holds view that this force also regents hw the time being body of irregular troops employed in military operations in 1 ersia whose cost cannot be met from Indian revenues under !he Govern- ment ofLidm^t, but should be debited to Imperial revenues in entirety Tf / ailiam entary resolutions. He cites in support of his view your telegram of 2nd March last and your telegram of 31st March last 1916, concludino- 071 AT 'fmf am ° f !° th . March r 1916 ’ No - 434 D and your telegram ot 11 h March 1916 regarding immediate object of Sykes’ Mission and force laised by him locally, also fact that such local troops as he was able to raise were employed during the past year mainly in counectioh with military operations, and that our connection with force has been transferred on our side to Commander-m-Chief and to Army Department. His contention is turtner strengthened by present military organisation of force, which consists ol units ol artillery, cavalry and infantry divided into brigades, and by recent appointments to it of qualified General Staff Officer and experienced adminis trative Staff Officer as well, as about 40 other military .staff and administrative officers similar to those employed with a military division. He considers that true nature of expenditure incurred by His Majesty’s Imperial and Indian Governments in connection with force is that of subsidy to Persian Government, and as this subsidy is being paid in pursuance of a definite pobey adopted by W ar Cabinet lor the vigorous and successful prosecution of military operations against Germany and Turkey in which His Majesty’s Government is employed, expenditure should be treated as part of cost of such operations and that no part of such expenditure can be charged to Indian revenues under Government of India Act and parliamentary resolu tions. His objection applies equally to meeting from Indian revenues any part of various other items, so-called political expenditure, which is being incurred by Imperial Government or by us in Persia in connection with war. 3. We regret we failed to obtain Comptroller and Auditor-General’s ruling as regards expenditure at an earlier stage, but we consider that now that his views have been expressed they ought to be accepted, and we gather from your telegram of 17th November last under reply that they will prove to be in accord with your own. If so, you will no doubt take the necessary action. . 4- Credit would of course be afforded with reference to accepted principle for the normal cost of officers and men deputed from our peace establishment for service with the rifles and other levies. Amount of such credit [? will be] inconsiderable as it will be generally speaking limited to ordinary pay and allowances of a few officers of Indian Political Department. In the ease of military personnel no additional credit will need to be afforded ni connection with calculation of India’s contribution in respect of Indian Expeditionary Forces and assessment of extra expenditure in India necessitated thereby. \V r e have already credited Imperial Government with the normal cost of pay and allowances of our entire peace strength of officers and men. As regards subordinate non-military establishment, e.g., clerks, any officer deputed for service with the rifles and levies is generally replaced in his substantive Indian appointment by another drawing full pay of appointment. ■ pm Reference Paper.

Endeavours are being made by Rich to find a diversion to east of Tangizmdan. Alternative western route through Tangizagh and Saidabad and eastern route via Khanu appear to have actually been used m the past by wheeled vehicles and to improve either for motor traffic would, prove less costly and far easier than the route via Tangizmdan. Depredations of Baharlus alone caused the abandonment of the Tangizagh route which appa rently was formerly the regular caravan route.

Other things being equal it is desirable that the road for permanent traffic should follow or lie not far from the telegraph line, viz , from Bunder Abbas through Daulatabad, Baft and the Kefaun Pass to Kernlan. But if the engineering difficulties to be dealt with and the cost and time required to com plete a road are markedly less by a different route, such as, for instance, that through Khani to Rigan, this route should be followed, subject however to your• /? 6 ascertaining from local Consular officers that there are no political objections to its adoption. 4 . You should throughout work in close touch with the local Consular officers, who have been asked to give you every assistance. 5 . Your reports under (a), ( 6 ) and (c) should be accompanied by such surveys and sketches as are necessary. They should deal fully with the advan tages and disadvantages of the different routes examined. Under (a) the cost of any work needed to the route selected to enable motor lorries to reach Ker man and to improve the route for occasional traffic should be stated, and an estimate given of the time required to carry it out. Your report on the perma nent road (&amp;) and (c) should deal with the question of the possibility of obtain ing suitable stone and water for the construction of a metalled road, means of transport and arrangements necessary for feeding workmen and escorts, and the amount and quality of the labour locally obtainable. 6 .

You will render your accounts to the Surveyor-General. Reports of progress and your final report will be submitted to the Chief of the General Staff Note of requirements for a road for mechanical transport:— ( 1 ) The standard to be worked up to is that ultimately the road will present no interruptions to continuous traffic. This requires that all nullahs which stop traffic when in flood should be bridged. If this standard cannot be worked up to at once it may be accepted that an Irish bridge is admissible when a despatch of more than one foot of water over it is not likely to last for more than 24 hours. In dealing with small nullahs, bridges should be provided where these would be of an inexpensive character or where the steepness of ramps or other local features would render an Irish bridge an undesirable obstacle to continu ous motor traffic. (2) The minimum width of metalling is to be 12 feet. (3) The minimum width of road in the clear at bridges is to be 15 feet. (4) The sharpest curve permissible is one of 35 feet radius at the centre line. (5) Sharp curves should be suitably banked. ( 6 ) The maximum gradient permissible is 1 in 10. The heaviest vehicle likely to be used on the road is the War Office subsidy 3 ton lorry.the loci i political n'ti Surreror-fei ic, Iiii foot ( ramps« ir II' o' ir ( f i' s ' 28 No. 103, dated Bander Abbas, the 1 st December 1916 From Major E.

As ordered in your No. ^ 15407-Confidential of 24th November 1916 I have the houour to send herewith a narrative account of my progress up to date together with a Iv ote as to the relative desirability of the various routes from Bunder^ Abbas to Nerman for first class motor traffic compiled from local information and reports of previous reconnaissances I send with the report four photographs to illustrate the Tang-i-Zindan and one copy of p^odidoo s ^ ee t of Southern Persia on which I have marked road and railway routes. Narrative Report of Major E. T. Rich, R.E., in charge of the Rersia Survey Party, surveying for a Motor Road between Bunder Abbas and Kerman, dated 4th December 1916. 1 . I left Simla on November the 8 th and proceeded to Debra Dun to see the Surveyor-General leaving agai*n on November the 9th for Karachi, whence I sailed for Bunder Abbas on November the 12 th and reached there on November the 15th. 2 . On November 16th the Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas, Mr. Howson, called together the leading merchants engaged in forwarding trade to Kerman and Yezd, with a view to ascertaining from them the routes which caravans usually follow in winter and summer and the causes which led them to follow those routes. 3. We examined them very thoroughly and arrived at the following conclusions; practically the whole of the caravans from Bunder Abbas to Kerman now follow the direct route through the Tang-i-Zindan—Dau- latabad and Baft (Route 143 of Routes in Persia, Volume IV) except for three months during the winter when snow lies too deep on the Kafanu Pass which is 9,400 feet high. During these three months caravans abandon the direct route, and go either via Khanu along route 141 or via the Tangi-i-Zagh and Saidabad along route 144, though very few caravans attempt the latter route nowadays from fear of attack by Baharlu raiders, whose country lies close to the west of this route. Caravans for Kerman follow these three routes only and never go the roundabout route 139 via Rigan. I enquired if wheeled vehicles had ever been taken up any of these three routes to Kerman and was told that in the memory of my informants about 20 years ago a big 40-pounder gun with limber had been drawn by horses up route 144 through the Tang-i-Zagh to Kerman and that three or four years ago, two carriages for the Governor of Kerman had been drawn up route 141 via Khanu but they all agreed that no wheeled vehicles had ever gone or could go by route 143 through the Tang-i-Zindan owing entirely to the difficulties of the Tang-i-Zindan beyond which the road was fairly easy the whole way to Kerman. t 18 I then enquired why, if heavy guns were dragged up the Tang-i Zagh, route 144, in former years, the carriages for the Governor three or four years ao-o were taken by route 141, for preference, and they replied that route HI, although more difficult than 144, was taken owing entirely to the lear of attack by Bakarlus on the latter route. They also said that although nowadays the Tang-i-Zinclan route, 14*3, was most frequented, it had only become popular in the last 20 years as it was the best protected from Baharlu attacks on caravans, but that previous to that time the Tang-i-Za^h route, 144, was the usual route at all the seasons of tne year’whilst the Tang^i-Zindan and Khanu routes, 143 and 141, were in those days hardly ever used except by caravans having business alonsr them between Bunder Abbas and Kerman. I w r as very insistent as to the difficulties which X had heaid existed through the Tang-i-Zagh, as recorded in the description of route 144 in the Boute Book, but they all said that the difficult portion was only for a short distance and was nothing like as bad as the difficulties on the lang-nZindan ; it looks therefore as if the Boute Book had much exaggeiated tnc difficult portion of the Tang-i*Zagh. Thorn this enquiry, it therefore appears that the Tausr-i-Zindan route, 143, is the moss frequented route at present, being safest from raiders ; that in the absence of raiders, route 141 via the lang-i-Zagn would be the one most used as wms the case 20 years ago ; that the route through Khanu, 141, which is now used when route 143 is closed by snow is only 'used owdng to the dangers on route 144 ; that wffieeled vehicles have actually been taken in the past througu both the iang-i-Zagh and Khanu routes but never through the Tang-i-Zindan, except once when a light carnage w as carried through with w heels removed. 4 As my personnel consisting of Mr. Murphy and Khan Bahadur Sher Jung w r ith four surveyors and 32 khallasis and all my instruments and equipment were not expected to reach Bunder Abbas tor a week or ten days after my arrival (they actually arrived on November 27th), I decided in order to save time to make a reconnaissance of the road through the Tang-i- Zindan to last ten days and left Bunder Abbas on November 18th returning there on November 27th. 5. I found that the road from Bunder Abbas for 48 miles as far as Nian, between stages 3 and 4 of loute 143, requires very little work to make it fit for motor lorries, as it goes over the open plain with a surface of hard gravel for 50 per cent, of the distance, the remaining surface being sand or shingle over which a lorry could travel slowly without difficulty. The road goes along no stream beds and practically the only work to be done would be (a) the approaches to two nallahs require widening and cutting to an easy slope for a distance of 20 yards ; tussocks of grass and sand wmuld have to be removed in the sandy . portions; boulders must he moved to one side across three stream beds. Local unskilled labour w ould be sufficient, I think, to do this work in a month or six weeks at a cost of under 1110,000 though I have not w orked out actual estimates, 6 . From Nian onwards for 12 miles to the entrance of the Tati g-i-Zirdan the track goes along the wide bed of the Ahniadi river. The first seven miles of this track is covered with big boulders which would have to he cleared to one side, an unsatisfactory piece of wmrk as the first flood would move tnem back again to their original position. The surface is then easier for two miles, being covered with fine shingle followed by a mile of big boulders; the river bed then narrows to 50 yards but the going is good for the remaining two miles at the end of which the tract leaves the Ahmadi river and enters the Tang-i- Zindan. T’rom Bunder Abbas to* this point a motor lorry could be taken without much difficulty. 7. At the entrance to the Tang-i-Zindan, the track narrows to 8 yards between high walls of crumbly sandstone of a slope of about 1 and 2 , mteis- persed with loose gravel cut into by deep fissures.

This ends the flnnri 101 ] ° • r ° i ln . wb i c h there is danger of caravans being overwhelmed by s during the winter season when rain is frequent. The track then goes up si e nallah for a mile at an easy slope over loose gravel. It then leaves the Obstruction 7 . nallah and winds up a narrow spur for R ^ . . half a mile at a slope of 8 degrees to the mit of the Sar-i-Sikh at 12 ^ miles whence the track descends 3 miles to the camping ground at Ab-i-£hur. t P or ^ 0n ba .^ a m ^ e U P the spur would require regular road making o nt it even for dragging a motor car up to the summit as the track is only a out 5 feet wide with step slopes each side and to make it wide enough for a motor would require heavy cutting.« 10 The hills formmg the sides of ^ Tang-i-Zindan^ar^ and out UP hy nu_ dry torrent bedS 8 From this description of the 12i miles from the month of the Tang-i- Zmdan to the Sar-i-Sikh, I think it is evident that according to m y mstruc- tions fai No motor car could be dragged along this route m its present V ' state nor could it be quicklv adapted for this purpose owing to the work necessar y to clear the obstructions which occur in seven places in the gorge itself and in making a road up the half mile of spur to the Sar-i-Sikh. _ All local information points to the routes ma Klianu on the east and the Tang-i-Zagh on the west as much better routes through which in the past wheeled vehicles actually have been dragged so that a motor could probably he dragged up those routes without anything approaching the work necessary in the Tang-i-Zindan. (b) No improvement or modification of this Tang-i-Zindan portion can be suggested to render it generally usable by occasional cars as the whole route till the Taug-i-Zindan is left at 11 miles lies in the middle of the actual nallah bed, so that any improve ments made in the nallah bed such as causeways removal of rocks to one side, etc., would be absolutely nullified by the firs flood that came sweeping down the gorge which would bring the track at once back to its previous state. During the cold weather when rain may be expected at any time the passage of the gorge is apt to he dangerous as floods come down -nitliout warning and so suddenly that it is difficult for caravans to escape except lit a few open spaces. I had a very good view from the summit of the Sar-i-Sikh 0Tf ? the each side of the gorge, and I consider that no development is possible to either side for raking a road on a high level any distance away fr ° m gor ^ h 0Illy whole country is broken and cut up by ravines in every direction. J remaining alternative, therefore, would be a road cut out of the side of. tte &lt;-or»e above high flood level of which the cost would be absolut ly p , for a road meant only to take occasional cars and even for a permanent for motor lorry traffic. f My opinion, as to the difficulties of the Tang-i-Zindan, agrees with that the railway engineers who worked out an estimate for taking a .™ e , og this gorge from Minab to Buhramabad—a distance of over mi (p ^ to 31, Karachi Extension Railway Survey, Volume III of 19io). T cost estimated by them for earthwork and bridging only, along 3UU mu this length, worked out at R73,000 a mile, whilst for the i2J mite otjue Tang-i-Zindan the estimate came to six lakhs of rupees a mile or ( \ much as the average for the remaining length, which speaks tor Use • » also reported that no development was possible on either side anc temporary line could be built through the gorge. The railway had ^ gradient through the gorge of 1 in 25, whilst for the road it has been g 1 in 10 , but in working along the sides of a gorge where no deve p possible the road would probably follow practically the same line as way, and the only saving would be in shallower cuttings, smaller » j avoidance of tunnels. Putting the cost of the road as low as ^ railway estimate, it works out at a lakh of rupees a mile for ear bridging alone or 12 ^ lakh for the whole gorge. ^ If this was absolutely the only practicable route from Bunder - Kerman, of course any expense necessary for the construction ot the v via have to be put up with, but as there are two other fairly direct the Tang-i-Zagh, route 111, and via Khanu, route 111 , and 0116 ind H J better 'Ripenn. route 139. all of which local information points to as bem 0fell Ig-l-ilM p iable lif M®, i is leftaiEI fkianji^ fPdtioii, 6 : - pefl « 4t; &gt; than the route via the Taug-i-Zindan, it would seem inadvisable to throw money SS Sir hr T&gt; 9 - | io ' eral , seems t° h® Very insistent that the line to Kerman via L t “The t! 1 ;i 0 zL e d 435 shouldbefoUowed - andasthe road S J e tnrou h me lang-i-Zmdan seems impracticable, I am now, by his desire trying to find a de our 20 miles to the east via Gulashkird to meet route 143 again at Pm or Daulatabad, failing which he seems to be conyinced that a road must be found through the Tang-i-Zindan. As I remarked in the preced ing paragraph, I do not deny that a road could be made through the Tan ®-;. Zmdan at prohibitive cost, but is it a vital necessity to adopt route 143 if cheaper routes can be found elsewhere ? It is doubtful if a detour practicable for motors can be found, but on the supposition that one is found, Twill mean the lengthening of the original route of 270 miles by an extra 50 miles, thus bringing it to 320 miles ®*s. practically the same length as the routes via the Tanga-i-Zagh, No. 144, and Khanu, No. 141. The road via the detour would follow route 141 for at least 73 miles to -Pariah, and it seems undesirable to deliberately leave this regular route at that point m order to go across county to Daulatabad over at least two mountain passes over 6,000 feet high and thence via Baft and the 9,400 feet Kafanu pass to Kerman, which is closed for three months in winter, when a better road could probably go straight on to Kerman via the Khanu route, 141, or else via lang-i- Zagh route, 144, to the west. X should be much obliged if you will kindly inform me by wire whether the Daulatabad-Baft line is considered so important that it must he followed either via the Tang-i-Zindan or by a detour to the east, as unless this is the case, I consider it a waste of time to spend much time surveying for this detour which could be better employed in surveying the remainder of route 141 from Pariah northwards and route 144. In the meantime, I have divided my party into two sections who have left Bunder Abbas, one to survey from Bunder Abbas towards Gulashkird and the other to work back from Daulatabad along the various roads connecting it with Gulashkird to try and find this detour which General Sykes believes to exist. 10 . After surveying for this detour to Daulatabad, I propose to see whether the Tang-i-Zagh route, 144, or Khanu route, 141, are not easier for taking up ears, for which purpose I propose to send half my party northwards from Pariah along the Khanu route and the other half under my native officer, Khan Bahadur Sher Jung, along the Tang-i-Zagh route, as we cannot survey the higher portions of road between Daulatabad and Kerman till the snow clears in March. The route 139 via Rigan, I do not propose to attempt, as full details cf this route from which estimates can be based are obtainable from the reports of the Karachi kxtension Railway Survey. Zagh to be unsound from a Political and Military point of view, though I do not understand why, as from a Military point of view it appears to be the best paragraph. I am assuming that the chief obstacle on the Tang-i-Zagh route, that is the Tangi-i-Zagh itself, is practicable. I have not yet seen it myself but, as stated in my paragraph 3 , all local information points to it as a much less formidable obstacle than the Tang-i-Zindan. rm '~ ^— ■) X not allowed to survey the Tang-i-Zagh in 19^2 owing to political objections due to fear of attack by the Baharlus, but this objection will probably be withdrawn early in the new year, as I am informed that the Qawam-ul-Mulk, who is the Chief of Laristan, is about to take measures against the Babarlua after which they are likely to be quiet for some time to come. 11 . I have attached a note I have made on the four possible routes for a permanent first class motor road from Bunder Abbas to Kerman compiled partly from local information, from Volume IV, Routes in i'ersia, and from the reconnaissances made by the Karachi Extension Railway Sur veyors in 1912-13, vide Karachi Extension Railway Project, Volume III, of 1913. 12 . Notes on the four possible routes for a motor road from Bunder Abbas to Kerman— (a) The four possible routes are from West to East : (i) Route 144 of Volume IV, Routes in Persia, through the Tang- i-Zagh and Saidabad, length 324i miles. (ii) Route 14)3 through the Tang-i-Zindan, Daulatabad and Baft, length 270 miles, or with a detour avoiding the Tang-i-Zindan. 320 miles. (Hi) Route 141 through Khanu, length 338 miles. (iv) Route 139-114)-14 j1 via Rigan, length 458 miles. ( 5 ) In Volume III-1913 of the Karachi Extension Railway Survey of 1912-B., accounts are given of long lengths of the above routes which were reconnoitred by the railway surveyors. On page 2 of this Volume : Route B followed route (iv) above. „ c „ ,, (m) » followed route (ii) through the Tang i-Zindan and D \ then went across country N.-W. via Ahmadi and Routes Niga to j oin rou t e (^ 0 r as an alternative along (i) the V. whole distance. (c) I have marked the four road routes and the railway routes on the accompanying map for reference, giving the road routes and their numbers as given in Volume IV of Routes in Persia and the railway routes with their letters as given on page 2 of Volume III, Karachi Extension Railway Survey. (d) Of the numerous routes reconnoitred by the railway, route B was adopted as the best through the country east of Kerman and alternative route ^ for the country west of Kerman. The Railway Survey Party were not allowed to survey the sot them portion of the Tang-i-Zagh route for political reasons, so were unable to decide whether it was best to go through the Tang-i- Zagh or the Tang-i-Zindan. (Paragraph 3 of my narrative report, dated 1st December, points to the Tang-i-Zagh being the easiest whilst the railway report on the last paragraph of page 2 believes the Tang-i-Zindan to be the easiest.) All the remaining v routes were abandoned as unfavourable for a railway, though it does not follow that they might not be better for a road. (e) Discussing the comparative merits of the four routes in order :— (i) Route 144 .—Erom a military point of viev r , if the physical obstacle of the Tang-i-Zagh is not prohibitive, this route, through Saidabad to Kerman, seems the one to a m for as posts along it will effectively close all the exits f r01 ^ Baharlu country to the east which w ill not be the case if any routes farther east are chosen. On this route are the Chashma Sufed and Khan-i-Surkh passes both about 8,000 feet high but easy. The road passes through Saidabad which.£ j 1 understand the most effective centre for controllincr the Baharlus and it is also the main road to Yezd from B un der Abbas, as far as from Saidabad and from Kerman to Saida- bad it ls the main Kerman-Shiraz road besides wide , it makes an alternative route from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz SerV -f *7?

Carri ages however were taken through this pass three or four years ago so that the road cannot he ycry difficult. It is 346 miles long, but 70 miles of it serves a double purpose lying alon°- the easy Kerman-Bam road which is reported as requiring very little work to make it adaptable for fast motor traffic ° (iv) Route 139.—via Minab and Rigan is much the lono-est of the routes, being nearly 100 miles longer than any of the others. According to the railway report its length is 437 miles but the whole distance serves two purposes. Prom Bunder Abbas to Azizahad west of Regan it serves also for the main Bunder Abbas-Sistan route, whilst from Azizabad to Kerman is also the main Kerman-Sistan route. There are practically no obstacles on this route and no bad passes as on the other routes as the Gishu Pass, which, according to the Route Book, is formidable, is pronounced easy by the railway surveyors. The cost per mile along this route would be less than on the other routes as it is easy going practically all the way. The railway surveyors considered this the easiest route from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, vide pages 20 to 22 of Railway Survey, Volume III, working at only R87,000 per mile for a narrow gauge railway including, I believe, railway plant, etc., etc. ) Looking at these routes as a whole from a broad point of view, \ routes 144 and 139 at the west and east extremities both serve as routes to the important centres of Yezd and Sistan respec tively, in addition to Kerman, whilst the two centre routes 143 and 144 practically serve Kermah only except for a short 70 miles in route 141 which is along the Kerman-Sistan road. In addi tion, route 144 would apparently control the Baharlus to the west, whilst route 139 would control the Baluchis to the east, advantages which the centre routes do not appear to possess. Route 143 seems impracticable owing to the obstacle of the Tang-i- Zindan leaving only route 141 which seems to have no advantages in distance, practicability or situation over route 144 and serves only Kerman and 70 miles of the Kerman-Sistan route, whilst 144 serves also for a main route to Yezd and Shiraz over the whole of its length.14 (a) The conclusion, therefore, seems to be that m the two best routes are 1U to the west and 139 to the east, (l) thejwo^ anyhow ^ a¥e t0 be bullt some time, to serve Tezd and Sistan respectively; , , f21 route 144 is more difficult than 139 but is much shorter and therefore more suitable for a motor road, ~ ( 3 ) the cost of both routes will probably work out equal; r li as a railway from Bunder Abbas to Kerman is more likely to { ) follow route 139 than 144, it would he more advisable to make the route via 144 as the country will then become opened out in both directions. 30 'Beamed with Army Department memorandum No. 513, dated the January 1917.)

I am told by Persian Superintendent that line would hardly pay for a clerk at Sirjan. According to him there are about 60 miles of suitable^ wire available at Kerman and Bahramabad and more at Anar.

I am fully convinced that route u and Baft is the best. Adequate protection will be arranged oth during and after construction. In this connection when will work start? Full advantage should be taken of the short winter. Telegraph stations at both above places are necessary and telephone offices at practically every stage with controlling centre at above places. There should be a two-wire line both to use telephone and to serve as an alternative route to India. Rate of Bandar Abbas would automatically drop to one-seventh present rate and thereby benefit British vrscic. As to the road exact line would be decided by engineer asked for in my tele gram No. 236-C., June 18th, in which connection Tangizindan might be avoided by a nne further east wffiich is said to exist. Road would be favourably viewed by all classes and labour could be arranged without much difficulty. There are no local subordinate engineers but given an adequate staff work could be started simultaneously at various points. Mosquito curtains are essent al in coast districts.

Officer Commanding South Persia Rifles at Bandar Abbas can only provide thirty partially trained able-bodied men as escort to telegraph working parties. Even if these men can be relied upon, which seems doubtful, number is insufficient. Considering abnormal activity this year of Baharlu and seriousness of situation in Kerman Province, I think it necessary that an escort of at least one double-company Indian Infantry up to field service strength should be provided for the protection of working parties. Suitable escort will be necessary for engineer party. (Addressed Foreign; repeated Kerman, Cox, Sykes, Bushire, Tehran.) Telegram, No. 734, dated the 2nd (received the 3rd) September 1916.

As however Government of India considering despatch of further reinforcements above incident will undoubtedly influence their decision. Apart from this Central Persian line was built without much difficulty, robbers not valuing telegraph material, Parties were guarded by local levies if necessary, and this should be done for engineer and working parties. Until Baharlus severe ly dealt with by regular troops, as we are both urging, there would always be risk of raiding parties , but matter too important not to run risks if necessary. I will try to effect something in connection with Baharlus at Shiraz. I consider that construction of these communications will enable us to deal with robbers much more effectually than at present. Commandant, South Persia Rifles, and Gov ernor, Bandar Abbas, can supply adequate force up to Daulatabad, and I hope to arrange with Kawam to send strong instructions to Governor, Ahmadi. There is every reason to believe that situation both in north Persia and elsewhere will im prove and this together with arrival of reinforcements will cause general improve ment Kerman Province and remove many difficulties.Telegram P., No. 78, dated (and received) the 4th September 1916.

If this cannot be sanctioned, however, I venture to advise employment of half company of Indian Infantry under an officer, preferably British, to stick to local escort. From 30 to 50 men would be supplied by Governor of Bandar Abbas in his own district and Buck can supply 30 men now and 20 more probably after two or three weeks. These men, however, are not much more reliable than Ahmedis.

Construction of line piecemeal is deprecated by Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, who points out as material is to be landed at Bandar Abbas best course would be to make all arrangements from Depot whence stock should be sent to Kerman and line constructed through to Kerman. He urges further that until we are able to deal with Baharlus we should endeavour to ascertain price for which they would undertake to protect caravans with material and construc tion parties or that Sardar Nosrat might undertake task.

Telegram No. 474 of September 12th from Vice-Consul, Bunder Abbas. Minis ter’s view that telegraph line should be constructed from Bandar Abbas onwards to Kerman, and not in sections from the terminals is concurred in by Government of India. Work on construction should be started as soon as construction party is ready and need not be delayed pending arrangement of protective measures for whole line. Provision of military escort would mean diversion of troops from more urgent employment elsewhere. South Persia Rifles should therefore supply as strong escort as possible, and Howson in consultation with Lorimer should negotiate with Deputy Governor, Bandar Abbas, for local responsibility for protec tion of construction party and line through his limits. Protection of next section should meanwhile be arranged, and steps taken to induce Kawam, if possible, to undertake responsibility for Ahmadi. CJ M.

Dear Sir, An officer in your Department rang me up on the telephone on Tuesday in connection with War Office letter 0162/154 (F.W.4.A) of 6th September, 1916, about the supply ol wire for the Kerman-Bunder Abbas telegraph. I have looked up the papers, and find from the Viceroy’s telegram of 24th August last (copy enclosed in our letter to the War Office P.3413 of 26th August) that India can supply the insulators etc., for the telegraph line, and that all they want from * here are the 300 miles of 4 m/m iron wire which you have promised to supply. We need not therefore trouble you to do more than you have undertaken to do in your letter under reference. The officer who spoke to me was in some doubt on this point, and seemed to think that the War Office were required to supply other stores besides the wire mentioned in your letter.

Reference enclosures to Foreign Secretary’s letter 59 M, 28tli July. On 9th August, Lorimer reported that for six weeks past Baharlus had been raiding and infesting road, particularly in vicinity of Sir]an and Baft, and asked for despatch of Indian force to deal with situation. Minister supported him. Since then raiding gangs have apparently moved south in direction of Bunder Abbas and caravans have come through from Daulatabad without interruption. Major Wagstaff, appointed to South Persia Military Police, is on his way to Kerman with drafts for Sykes’ column. Opportunity will be taken by M agstaff if the situation admits to withdraw prisoners from Kerman now in Saidabad and to despatch them with regular escort to the coast. On arrival at Daulatabad, Wagstaff will have 40 cavalry, 200 infantry and 50 Persian irregulars. He has been ordered to report from there how far situation affects carrying out of instructions. At Bunder Abbas there are 129 Indian troops and 161 South Persia Military Police. Result of Wagstaff’s report will be sent. r , &lt;4. ' -8 k; 'tMinute Paper. Register No. 3/00 Secret Department.

In your D/0 letter of 26th inst to Mr Chamberlain you observe that it might b^e possible for War Office to provide the material. We should like to know definitely whether this is so, before we take any further action for its provision. (sd) S. G. Barrow.Dictated 26th July 1916. ter Mr Chamberlain, We received a few days ago a copy of a telegram from Sir Percy Sykes to the Government of India, dated the 22nd^l3$, advocating the construction of a telegraph line from Bandar Abbas to Kerman. On the 14th June India declined to sanction construction on the grounds of shortage of telegraph material. im.y o. may not be desirable to make this telegraph line, but the grounds upon which it was refused are not satisfactory because if India could not provide the material the War Office should have been given an opportunity of saying whether they could. I thi nk _we perhaps^ could. If Sir Percy Sykes' requests continue to be met in this spirit (and this is not the first example as you know) the pacification of South Persia will continue to be hampered. I attach a short Note which has been prepared in this. Department, which I think you may like to have. I concur generally with what is stated in the Note. e Right Hon: Austen Chamberlain, M.P.' - - I - /y ahvrr (iio) ^YezcZ. ffthwa-z. lVS , /;/ na . 2 ^^/fermcrrr //V //X /f«A t n&gt;ahk$iah S' \ sv \ ' N&gt;rtx »? utLar- ~~ft&gt; Indu w f /* IcLTtfj-i ~z.i nt/ttrt 'S^ &lt; X£30£*77t/e/?- f-f-i^rCiS # F ( I ^—v /bo 2co ffo Opt) $€$/&lt;&amp; fyOO $oo vrv/tS _South Persia Military Police. Sir Percy Sykes asked the Government of India as a matter of urgency, to construct a telegraph line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, on the 22nd April. The request was refused owing to the shortage of telegraph material in India. The matter was not referred to the War Office, and this (21st July) is the first we - actVe heard of it in the printed telegrams sent us by the India Office. We heard in a similar manner, two months late, that the Govt, of India was unable to send sir P. Sykes a small reiri.ioroement in oflicers and instructors which he had asked for. I understand from P. W. 4 that had India asked the W. 0. f for telegraph material in this case there would probably have been no difficulty in supplying it. The inference is that India do not realise the urgency of consolidating sir P. Sykes’s and incidentally the whole British position in South Persia. I General Hjalmarson, when considering his plans for the 'Kerman” regiment of the 'Swedish' gendarmerie informed me that he could .not think of accepting responsibility for the Kerman - Bunder Aboas road, unless the telegraph line was sanctioned* . # -'±, . - fjt : )Yjf Lf 7) fsA \ - J! - —Jl S, /~v i That line, if necessary in 1913, under the then e^ioting conditions (the Gendarmerie v/ere 'based' on Teheran through Yezd and Isfahan) is infinitely more so now that ' the road from Bander Abbas to Kerman is the sole line of communications of Sir P. Sykes*s force* Under certain circumstances, the Bander Abbas - Kerman road may assume a still greater importance, it has oeen proposed to send a small force to Isfahan via the Bakhtiari road (Ahwaz line). One of the conditions wnich render such a detachment practicable, is that should the Bakhtiari road be closed by the fickle tribesmen who control it, the supply of ammunition could be assured by uhe Binder Abbas, Kerman, Yezd route, provided that that road is under our control. It is of the greatest importance for the rapid pacification of Southern Persia,that the main centres should be united by roads passable by motor transport. Once the true plateau is reached at Kerman there are no existing obstacles. Motors have passed between Teheran, Isfahan, Shiraz and Kerman. Sir Percy Sykes*s re commendation for the construction of a motorable road between Bander Abbas and Kerman is worthy of the most careful consideration. It would strengthen our position very greatly. The Bander Abbas - Kerman railway is not likely to take shape for some considerable time. (Sgd.) R. A. Steel. Major G. S. M. I. 2.

This eorntr^Hn^^f S fi° n r ly Swedes who ’ 1 understand, pressed for the construction of the line, with numerous telephone stations, before they were prepared to take over charge of the route. It is also to be remembered that a disaster m the early days of the Police would be a very serious matter. 3. A second ronte^ which should be considered with a view to the con- s ruction of a telegraph line in the future is one running from Kerman to Shiraz via Sirjan and Niriz. This line would practically cut the Southern Bersia ot the raiding tribesmen into two sections and would immensely facilitate my work. It would be a source of some revenue, a Kerman-Sirian branch having been strongly urged upon me by the merchants of the latter centre who suffer from its absence. Sirjan will also be an important Police centre m due course of time. 4. Another question of considerable urgency is the improvement of the road fiom Bunder Abbas to Kerman into a track fit for wheeled traffic and especially for motor lorries. When the force reaches considerable numbers at Kerman, the obsolete and slow method of transit by camels and donkeys as a permanent arrangement will be difficult from the military and economic point of view alike. Fortunately the routes on the plateau are ideal for motor transport and cars can run from Bigan and Bam on the east to Kerman, Yezd and Ispahan with practically no engineering difficulties to be faced. Prom the coast to the interior it is otherwise, but in the case of the Bunder Abbas route, the only really difficult section is that termed the Tang-i-Zindan. The pass over the main range Gudar-i-Kafanu which rises to 9,000 feet could probably be crossed by a motor lorry in its present condition. The first question will be to make a route passable by motor lorries and armoured cars and then to construct a metalled track. This road and its telegraph line will do much for the cause of law and order in Sofith-East Persia and will strengthen ^ the hands of the Police. These proposals should, therefore, he viewed mainly from this standpoint. 5. Bunder Abbas is the natural port for Kerman and Yezd and for the Hinterland as far as distant Herat. It will in the future, I am cocfident, he the chief seaport of Southern Persia and may, through the discovery of oil bearing strata in the neighbourhood, outshine the ancient glories of Ormuz, its island predecessor. 6.
