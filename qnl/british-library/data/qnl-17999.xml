                           Amherst, concerning present conditions of Bassidore [Bāsa‘īdū] and recommending certain alterations to the present buildings at that station. Norris informs Samuel Hennell that the Governor in Council, John Fitzgibbon, feels himself precluded at present from sanctioning any outlay on the buildings at Bassidore. In his letter, Blane discusses the advantages of Bassidore as a port and then makes detailed suggestions for improvements to the buildings there.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023654665.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
