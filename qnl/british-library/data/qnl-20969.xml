Dated Fort William, the 4tJi March 1899. Sir, I am directed to invite attention to the oirwular letter from the Covemnent of India in the Foreign Depart-ient, No.2816-1 dated the 7th July 1B91, regarding deni-official correspondence. J:. Of late years there has been a tendency to expand the scope of demi-official oorreB^ondenoe and to introduce, and even some times to repeat, in deni-official letters matters which should be or ha^e been, sufficiently dealt with in official papers. This tendency leeids to a considerable increase of work, and must be entirely discountenanced. ?. The circular above quoted explained the conditions and occar sions in and on which demi-official correspondence may properly be used. For the future demi-official letters received in the Foreign Office will, if they aopearvto be of penranent interest or .laportance* be generally brought on the record. When this i«i done, the fact will be intimated to the writer. Unless such in timation has been received, officers must conclude that their deifti-official letters have been treated as of no permanent im portance and are not available in the ^oreign Office for subse quent reference. 4. nie practice of stating a case demi -officially in the first instance, with &amp; view to ascertaining how it will be regarded if sent up officially, is productive of unnecossary extra labour and should not be rosouted to except in very special circumstances^ I have etc*, (sd).

Ihia matter has been discussed frequently in recent years both in the press and else where, and the Government of India are aware that in all provinces instructions for the guidance of young officers in Indian etiquette have either been issiu i or arc under preparation. The paramount necessity of displaying courtesy, fcact and good temper in their dealings with-the people with whom they are brought into dally contact has been more than once impressed upon all officers, European and Indian, both by' local Governments and by the Government of India, and mustbe well known to all. But since the possession of these qualities has so signi ficant 'a bearing upon the promotion of an officer and the lack of them constitutes so serious a disqualification, the Governor General in Council desires again to impress the Government of Bombay ^ _ _ the importance of this matter upon ^ and to inform with the you Secretary of-State's concurrence, that manifestations of grave defects of temper and repeated loss of self-control should be regarded as constituting inefficiency. 2.

'' 1 v ' It has occurred to me that some saving of labour would result, both to officers and their clerical staffs, by the adoption of the 'Docket Telegram' system. That is to say the .submission of all corresnondence, official and demi-official, save long and important letters or despatches, in the form of a telegram, sent by post. The rules for official telegraphic corres-oondence uould hold good also for docket telegrams, viz:- (1). They should be as brief as may be consistent 7/1 th clear -ness. (2). All mere formalities of phrase or address should be omitted. A further saving of clerical labour could be effected in routine correspondence such as sin-nle acknowledgment, re minders etc by not preserving office coT )ies of dociet tele grams of this nature. Officers would naturally use their own discretion as to how far they should avail themselves of this last suggestion and I have no wish to lay down any rule beyond requesting that in such cases they should state in their Docket Telegrams 'No copy kept'. For record pur poses a simple note on the document replied to would often suffice. Specimens of an official and deTii-official 'Docket Tele gram' are attached. Such communications should be on fools cap size paper to facilitate filing, and the heading should contain both name and abbreviated designation sender and receiver, number (except for D.O. dockets) and date, and - should be signed by sender.

All matters that have been reported elsewhere than in the weekly diaries should be rigorously excluded^ comments, prophecies and opinions shoult ordinarily be omitted and entries be strictly confinea to matters of real interest^and officers'should not be afraid of the entry 'J©thing of importance to record'• These oraers to take effect from the month of July and affect in no way the June monthly summary or the weekly di^ariee which will be preparec as usual.

The Governor General in Council has had under consideration the question of the communication to subordinate officers in civil employ of such unfavourable as may be made in regard to them by their superiors at the time of annual reports or on other occasions. The enquiries that have been made show that the procedure at present followed in different provinces, and even in different departments within the same province, is far from identical, and in the absence of an^ adequate reason for this variety of treatment, and having regard to the inconvenience likely to arise upon the transfer of an officer from one province or department to another in which different rules on the subject are in force His Excellency in Council considers that the matter should henceforth be dealt with on more uniform lines. 2. The diversity of practice which obtains is sufficient evidence of the difficulty of applying hard and fast rules to the subject, which is one of great importance both to the efficiency of administration and to the interests of the officers of Government ]3ut while recognising that some measure of elasticity is a necessary corollarv the Government of India see no- reason why, if certain guiding principles are laid clown as-appropriate to all departments and in all provinces, there should be anv difficulty in giving general effect to them. The arguments on both sides are well known ; in favour of free comntifnication are the contentions that it is not fair to condemn a man .behind his Back and that unless a man is told of his defects he has theiess chance of rectifying them. On the other hand in justification of the exercise of discretion in the extent and manner of communication it may be urged that if every unfavourable comment is to be passed on, superior officers will be apt to refrain from giving candid opinions on the merits of their subordinates, which would be an undesirable consequence ; secondly, that the communication of remarks in many cases will only lead to defences, objections and friction ; thirdly, that superior officers c&amp;n be trusted not to make improper use of the system of confidential reports. None of these considerations is without weight, especially as a general picture of an officer's merits or demerits, so far as the reporting authority has had full opportunity of judging of them, must be regarded as of considerably more -value than a report under certain specified headings which has a tendency to become stereotyped and lifeless. But it is the descriptive report which is apt to contain remarks of which it is inexpedient to apprise the officer concerned. Again, there may be good reasons why the departmental head or any ether authority dealing with the report should withhold final judgment; he would in such cases be well advised to await a subsequent report, which might either modify or corro borate previous Criticisms; in the former event no harm will have been done to the Officer concerned ; in the latter it would then be time enough to address him. It is also the case that at the time of report many observations upon ability and temperament suggest themselves which it is useless to convey to the officer reported upon. Such defects may be irremediable and their publication would only embitter or discourage the recipient. Further, the method of communication is often a consideration of much importance. The bfst form is frequently a personal letter giving credit for what is good, while instancing what requires to be corrected. The annual enumeration of defects, without any acknow ledgment of useful work done, may only lead to discouragement and soreness anddo more harm thap good. There is often a marked resentment of criticism on the part of a good officer which, however unreasonable, is genuinely felt, and may have a prejudicial effect on his future efficiency. For this reason the method to be employed in pointing out to an officer his particular shortcomings should be determined by a consideration of his individual temperament. Finally, in many, possibly the majority of cases, the superior officer has already, in one shape or another, made the defect or defects brought to notice the subject of warning or remonstrance. Examples of the fault or shortcoming will have occurred in daily work and will have been commented upon at the time, and it is therefore most desirable that a reporting officer should always state explicitly whether the attention of his subordinate has already been drawn to the defects noticed. Such an obligation would in itself tend to make the superior officer careful to avoid hasty and superficial comments. 3. In view of these considerations, His Excellency in Council, with the approval of the Secretary of State, is pleased to direct ^hat— * (a) when a report is built up on the individual opinions as noted af different departmental superiors in gradation, it is only the opinion as ^fcept- ed by the highest authority ^Which need be considered froii^h^ point of view of communication ; (b) as a general rule in no case should an officer be kept in total ignorance for any length of time that his superiors after sufficient experience of his work are dissatisfied with him ; in cases where a Earning might eradicate or help to eradicate a particular fault, the advantages of prompt communication are obvious; where criticism is to be with held the final authority to consider the report should record instruc tions, with reasons, according to the nature of the defect discussed, as to the period for which communication is to be kept back; (c) only those defects need be pointed out which can be remedied, since it would serve no useful purpose to communicate such criticisms as lack of ability or intelligence ; {d) the reporting officer should specifically state whether the defects -reported have been already brought in any other connection to the notice of the officer concerned ; (e) remarks in cases in which the local Government or hea'd of a depart ment or other officer suspends judgment should not be commu nicated ; • (/) great attention should be paid to the manner and method of communica tion in order to ensure that the advice given and the warning or censure administered, whether orally or in writing, shall, having regard to the temperament of the officer concerned, be most beneficial to him. 4. The above procedure should govern reports of a periodical nature. There are others which may either be— (i) reports of particular incidents or acts, which, if disciplinary action is taken, require either regular proceedings or definite censure after the defence of the officer concerned has been taken ; (u) reports in reply to inquiries whether an officer who has not been well reported on in the past has improved and is fit for promotion ; or (Hi) reports in answer to requests for opinions as to the fitness of an officer for a particular appointment, etc. No special instructions are necessary in respect of the first class, and as regards th e others the Governor General in Council considers that they should not be com- municated unless they lisclose facts or allegations which in the opinion of the local Government should be conveyed to the officer concerned. If such remarks were invariably communicated there is little doubt that reporting officers would bediscouraged from giving unreserved advice, and opinions of value would be thereby lost. There remains the question of the treatment of military officers' in. uivil employ. Hk Excellency in Council is pleased to direct that such of these officers as are not in permaijent civil employ should be dealt with under the King's Regulations, while those who are, should come under the rules, applicable to the civil officers of the departments in which they are serving. 6. 1 hese orders will not a^)ply to military medical officers who will continue to be governed by the orders conveyed in the Home Department letter nos. 251—260, dated the 14th May 1914, but for the rest the standing provincial or departmental instructions and rules should S3 soon as possible be revised with the view of embodying in them the principles now laid down. p%-iirOrdered a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to all local Governments and Administrations noted on the margin,* the several Departments of the Government of India (including the office of the Financial Adviser, Military Finance), the Superintendent, Port Blair, the Director General, Indian Medical Service, the Registrar, High Court, Calcutta, f the Direc tor, Criminal Intelligence, the Administrator General, Bengal, and the Official Trustee, Bengal, for information.

The queation waa when to fly the 'neraonal flag' of P.A. that is the 'Union Viceroy'a ' when he ia in a aailing boat # / when he ia in a rowing boat or amall launch it goea on the bow flagataff. When on a steamer or a la^rge launch with maata on the fore maat . 'So I asked Admiral Slade about it and he aaid the nroner place for peraonal flag in a aailing boat of the cut in uae here when you cant hoiat at bowa in the peak of the vard(aa I thought). Our boat here should never, fly the red enaign aa it ia a Government boat and conaequentlv ahould fly blue ensign or nothing. o Ever aince Admiral Hlade left I have been meaning to tell Nakhuda to get a amall pulley fixed on the vard with a^line so that T could hoist a small Jack- there when paying official callc. -But I have always forgotten. I waa surprised to see the boat flying a red ensign the other day, I dont know how it could do ao in view of very clear ordera at'A' which I remember of orders aa I have never seen this file before. A.P.T. 7/l3/l9ir5. P.3 . I suppose it is not noasible to 1 ✓. ? » ' «H. 0. i. I dont know where that red ens Ism oame fron. ''ho pot ft? — Perhaps Oaptain Lorimer did; as h© car^e from up o^untrv in Persia he had no knowledge of flags eto. ^ A government boat has nothing to do with a red ensign' which is entirely confined to mercantile marine and nrivately owned Britisah ships and boats. I only saw the boat flying a red ensiFr for the first time the other day wheri this man Ali was annointed Nakhuda and thev went off for Wali, a few weeks ago. I wis greatlv astonished - -&gt; a3 I thought (in the distance) that it was the Arab flag.' There was no need for our boat to flv a flag when it was the only white boat in the nlace, now there are several, and it is possible that in the event of a row alongside of the ship or anythinn- of that sort, reoDle might allege that thev did not know the boat was the Agency boat, if she had no flag flying. So in future she had better fir blue ensien at stow when I am not aboard, and a viceroy's union (at neak) in addition when I am aboard in accordance with Government.orders. This may be kept with file, and eventually when time per mits copied and put in it for future guidance.

The general obligations Incumbent on Government servants in ^respect Publishing or divulging the contents of official paperp^are defined in the folTowing orders :— , ^ ' Officers in the service of Government are prohibited from making public, without the previous sanction of Government, any documents, papers or information of which they may become possessed in their official capacity,' (Home Department Resolution no. 19-1134, dated the 8th July 1875.) ' His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General desires to 'remind all officers of the Government that information received by them in their official capacity, whether from official sources or otherwise, which is not from its nature - obviously intended to be made public, cannot be treated as if it were at their personal disposal. ' 'The Governor General does not think it necessary to issue any general order entirely prohibiting the disclosure, without special authority, of any infor mation received officially. In such matters much must necessarily be left to the discretion and intelligence of officers holding places of trust, and in charge of duties more or less important. But His Excellency would impress upon all officers the serious responsibility involved in the exercise of this discretion. Whenever there is any room for doubt as to the right course to pursue, the orders of superior authority should be obtained before information regarding the public affairs is communicated to any one not officially entitled to receive it. ' (Home Department Resolution no. l-C. H., dated the 16th December, 1878.) In 1884 instructions were issued explaining that official information of which the unauthorized communication to the public press was prohibited included not only matter still under discussion but matter finally decided on, as to which the manner and the time of publication might be not less important than the matter itself. (Home Department letter no. 30-126710 1276, dated the i6Lh August, 1884.) ' It must be clearly understood that no officer of Government, not specially authorized in that behalf, is at liberty to communicate to the Press, either directly or indirectly, information of w'hich he may become possessed in the course of his official duty. A similar professional reticence should be exercised by all officers of Go'vernment in their private and unofficial intercourse with non-official persons., and even with officers of Government belonging to other Departments. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General does not for a moment intend to debar officers of Government in private life from the same freedom in the discus sion of public events which is enjoyed by all Her Majesty's subjects ; but when an officer has in the course of his duty become possessed of special information not yet made public, he should always be strictly on his guard against the tempt ation of divulging it,'even to other servants of Government, when these are not officially entitled to his confidence. Irresponsible persons hearing facts of interest mentioned without reserve in the course of general conversation can scarcely be expected to refrain from repeating them to others, and thus giving them a premature and too often a garbled currency Officers of Government are bound to be as reserved in respect to all matters that may come within their cognizance during the discharge of their public duties as law yers, bankers, or other professional men in regard to the affairs of their clients. ' (Home Department Resolution no. 22«A., dated the 3rd June 1S85.) ' A Government servant may not, unless generally or specially empowered by the local Government in this behalf, communicate directly or indirectly to Government servants belonging to other Departments, or to non-official persons, or to the Press, any document or information which has come into his possession in the course of his public duties, or has been prepared or collected iDy him in the course of those duties, whether from official source 5 or otherwise. ' (Rule 17 of the Government Servants' Conduct Rules.) The disclosure of the confidential information of Government to unautho rized peVsons-is also a penal offence under sections 3 (1) (c) and (3) and 4 of the Indian Official Secrets Act, 1889 and section 2 of the Official Secrets Act, ■1911 (1 and 2 Geo. 5 Cap. 28), all of which provisions are in force in British India.2. The above instructions apply generally to all documents and information in the possession of Government. Documents (including letters or other com munications official or demi-official, maps, books, pamphlets, etc.), which require additional precautious to prevent the disclosure of their contents, may be clashed and marked as ' Secret' or 0 Confidential, ' and should then be treated in the manner explained in the two following paragraphs In all offices care should be exercised in deciding whether a particular document is to be classified as ' Secret 1 ' or ' Confidential ' or not, and the decision should invariably be made by a respon sible authority. While it is essentital that all papers, the contents of which are in reality secret or confidential, should be so treated in every office to which they are sent, it is also very desirable that the same treatment should not be extended, . as is often the case, to papers whose contents are neither secret nor confidential. An indiscriminate use of these designations produces much unnecesary trouble and waste of time, and has its danger in tending to lessen the attention which is paid to them.' Papers may sometimes be secret or confidential only until the occurrence of some particular event or announcement, and in such cases it is useless to continue afterwards'to treat them in this way. 3. The contents of papers marked ' Confidential ' (including all the docu- c./. Horn. Department utter „o. .6-5«. to 571, T' 1 , 3 ' etc -i mentioned in paragraph 2) dated the 16th February 1874. should be disclosed only to authorized per- sons or in the interests of the public service. They should not pass in the ordi nary course through an office, but be dealt with only by the head of the office, and, if necessary, certain trustworthy assistants, who should be specially autho rized for that purpose. If not passed by hand from one authorized person to another they should be sent in a sealed cover, or, as the practice is in some sec retariat offices, in boxes provided with special locks. They should not be brought into ordinary proceedings, but should be separately recorded, and kept in the cus tody of an officer who is authorized to deal with them. If printed, the spare copies and the proceedings volumes should be treated with the same attention as the originals. As few copies of confidential papers as possible should be printed, and a register should be kept of these showing how each copy has been diposed of. 4. Papers marked 'Secret ' are intended only for the personal information of the Government or individual to whom they are jssued and of those officers whose duties they affect. The officer to whom they are addressed is personally responsible that they are kept in safe custody, and that their contents are disclosed to the officers mentioned above and to those only. They should Jje kept in the personal custody of the officer to whom they are issued, except in the case of Government Secretariats, in which special arrangements may be made under due authority for their safe custody. When not in actual use they should be kept securely locked up in a receptacle of which the key or keys are not accessible to anybody except the officer responsible for them, and when in use care should be taken that access to them is not obtained by any unauthorized persons. A list of such papers should be kept by the officer responsible for them (or in the case of Government Secretariats under his orders) and, wl en relieved in his ap pointment, he will hand over both the list and the papers to his successor from whom a receipt or a charge certificate be taken. 5. When sent hy post confidential or secret papers should be enclosecl in double covers of which the inner one should be marked ' Confidential ' or ' Secret' and superscribed with only the name of the officer by whom it is to be opened. The outer cover should bear the usual official address # . Letters or packets containing confidential or secret papers sent by post should invariably be registered, and those containing secret papers should also be sent 'acknow ledgment due.'-. 6. Certain secret and confidential books, reports, maps, etc., are issued by Army Headquarters direct to local Governments and Administrations and certain offices, which are responsible to the Chief of the General Staff for their safe custody, etc. Instructions* have been issued by the Chief of the General Staff for the custody and disposal of such papers, and these instructions should be observed by all officers in respect of secret or confidential papers received by them direct from Army Headquarters. % C 17—I40—3*8 l7''GCBP Simla »-X'- &gt; V Kc.
