Political Agent, Memorandum: - £ Reference your printed Letter No. C/54E dated 26th May 1946, regarding Hassan Yusuf, one of the Egyptian teachers seconded for service in Bahrain. I 2. This teacher has throughout his service been thoroughly unsatisfactory and having completed his two years in Bahrain he is not being re-engaged. 3. Before coming to Bahrain he was told that, he could not bring his family as no accommodation was available. He disregarded this order and arrived at Baghdad with a wife, a female servant and five children. Having no money with which to pay the fares of his family he borrowed money from the Egyptian Consul on the surety of some of his colleagues to whom he gave documents guaranteeing that he would repay them from his salary. He has not yet repaid them. He now claims that the Egyptian Government should pay his family^ fares, the Egyptian Government is not responsible. 4. He is due to leave Bahrain on 15th June when he will receive about lis. 2,000/- on account of Provident Fund, leave pay etc. As a special case he was allowed to draw the equivalent of one air fare to Cairo, amounting to approximately r.s.800/-, in advance. 5. With the cash at his disposal it will be possible for him to convey himself and his family to Egypt, by travelling third class. 6. The Bahrain Government is not prepared to give a loan to Hassan Yusuf whose conduct, especially in the matter of bringing his family here against the implicit orders of the authorities in Egypt and the Bahrain Government, has been extremely unsatisfactory.

The Bahrain Government have written to sky that they are not prepared to give you a loan. They add that as a special case you have been allowed to draw the equivalent of one air passage to Cairo and that with this money and what you will receive in provident Fund, leave pay, and other allowances, you should be able to pay for the passages of yourself and your family to Cairo. 3. I also understand from the Bahrain Government that the Egyptian Government is not responsible for the payment of these passages and, in the circumstances, I do not propose to address them further.

The Ministry was liberal towards the Government of Bahrain or rather towards the Director of the British Institute in that an agreement was concluded to the effect that Egypt should provide for the pay as well as large dearness Allowances for these teacher^ from the Egyptian Budget and 'thatBahrain would only bear their Travelling Allowances to and fro. ^his would have been a grace, had this generosity been benefited from by the people of Bahrain or had the Egyptian Ministry of Education,,any supervision over or any knowledge about the Mission after its departure (from here) and arrival in the Persian Gulf Islands. But what is wondering in this matter is that the members of this Mission have no connection whatsoever - neither moral nor educational - with the Ministry of Education in Egypt, Administration and supervision are the sole monopoly of the British Institute and its puppets; nay not of the British Institute alone; for had this been the case it would have been easy as in the Institute there are many men of letters and culture. But the Mission is directly under an English Adviser of the Government of Bahrain (Mr. Belgrave). He is a man imperialistic in disposition and to him the most abhorrent thing is to see that rays of literacy penetrate the minds of the youths of Bahrain. How often did the members of the Mission complain to the Egyptian Government about the behaviours of th: T s Adviser, demanding that the supervision over Education in Bahrain should be the right of Egypt.' But no one to listen or respondl Officials of the Education department THE EGYPTIAN MISSION TO BAHRAIN ; Bahrain's contact with Egypt culturally dates back The body-in-charge of Education selected a number of Confidential. BAHRAIN RSCEl N®...-r? ;.... Dace....here would regard this Mission as if they regard their teachers in Sa'id or in the Lower Egypt, In fact, the . posti®n •f such Missions to the sister country is very precarious and it is necessary that the one sent (on such Mission) should be an ideal one to represent Egypt in that country and no teacher should he sent to teach in that country until after enquiries have been made about him and after his antecedents reviewed. The teacher there would feel that his Government would watch his work and would reward him for it according as he deserves. Thus, he would let his brain loose to be able to perform his duty towards a country that entertains every affection for Egypt. The teachers would not conceive that they are complying with the dictates of an English retrograde mentality, thereby serving its ends .and forgettinp their duty to act for their country and to render services to their Arabizm and their religion in that country. Tnaching in Bahrain: Teaching in these Islan is is not designed for the spread of enlightenment among the yourjj generation in an attem=pt to reach the country to perfection and to unite it with the Arab countries which are endeavouring towards progress; it aims at producing a number of youths who know Enrlish sufficient to take up subordinate posts with the Government. Nothing can illustrate this better than that in Bahrain there is a Secondary School under the Head-mastership of an Egyptian youngman who extended great efforts in the way of improving it and raising its standard, but many an obstacle rise in his way. In the school there are Egyptian teachers, all who are, at one time, hoaxed by the hope for improvement, at another time despondency enter into their hearts The curriculum is adjusted and re-adjusted in accordance with absolute orders, so that the allotted lessons for arabic and religion became 4 lessons against 12 lessons for English in a week. 3a''on Men^li tv; Bahrain people welcomed the Egyptian generous action with enthusiasm and pleasure and as the result of thisthey sent their hoys to Epypt for studying, hut only after the Adviser had given his consent. Bahrain thus had students in Spynt where they were received well and where a special house was constructed for them. They were all admitted into school freely and were looked after with care. The youths of Bahrain made a good start in picking up the Egyptian culture, made aneadway and became infatuated with the Egyptian life. From their talk it could be realised how they admired Egypt and the Egyptians and their le + ters to their people contained such admiration. But no sooner had this news reached the ears of the Adviser to the Government of Bihrain whose attention nothing can escape, than he hastened to write to the British Institute to send back the students. This ne i vs was a great shock to the boys who hastened to the Jirector of the British Institute, who Is one of the British Educationalists. How painful was their disappointment to fear' the apostle of humanity say&lt;s. 'It is better for you to return to your home and engage in fishing like your ancestors, as schooling will spoil you'. These boys tried to go to Labanon but they did not succeed as the (Adviser's) objective was to deprive them from seeing the light ef freedom which was enjoyed by the Levant countries, such as Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Finally, if the Egyptian Government will not see thst supervision over the Mission in Bahrain is her right it is better for her one thousand times and one time to withdraw it rather than wastefully expend Government's funds to which Egypt is more entitled. .fgSt U - ■ -M No.B/111 (13/262) His Excellency the Political Resident, Feibian Gulf, Bahrain presents his compliments to;- The Political Agent, BAHRAIN and has the iioncur to transmit to nil:. the undermentioned document(j; PEESIA'K GULF RESIDENCY Bahrain Dated the 14th May, 1948 RLFERENCE TO PREVIOUS CORRESPOKDEN Descript ion of E nc l osur e I^;.aL AND DA TE Cairo Note No.189 (207/2/48) of 22nd April 1948 to Royal Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 1 LB' SUBJECT FORWARDING OF LETTER FOR M.
