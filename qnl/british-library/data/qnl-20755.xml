Slaves applying for manumission may be accommodated at the Political Agency to which they have applied while their cases are under consideration After they have received their certificates they should be discharged 46639 ' 2 G214 I 4. A Political Agent or Political Officer should not give a certificate to a slave from the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman until he has obtained the agreement of the Muscat Consulate. 5 Any special cases which are likely to cause political repercussions should be referred to the Political Resident before action is taken. It it is considered that the slave's life is in danger he may be kept in safety pending the Political Resident s decision. 6. It should be made clear to manumitted slaves that they do not thereby acquire quasi British nationality or any other change of national status. 7. Applications of Saudi Arabians for manumission should in all cases be referred to the Political Resident. 8. Manumission certificates are not issued to local inhabitants in Bahrain or Qatar, where slavery has been abolished.

Note. —These Rules also apply mutatis mutandis to Her Majesty's Consulate, Muscat. APPENDIX C (Paragraph 42) Instructions for the Issue of No Objection Certificates for the Import of Firearms and Ammunition, issued by the British Residency, Bahrain in 1954 1. No Objection Certificates for the import of all types of firearms and ammunition will be issued by the Political Agent/Consul in the territory concerned, after consultation, if he thinks necessary, with the Political Resident. 2. Before entertaining an application for a No Objection Certificate the Political Agent/Consul should obtain from the Ruler concerned written confirmation that he has no objection to the granting of the application in question except that such confirmation is not required for requests for permission to import not more than 500 rounds of any one type of ammunition at any one time. 3. When considering applications, the Political Agent/Consul should bear in mind the objects for which the No Objection Certificate system exists, namely: — {a) to prevent arms from reaching the tribes of the hinterland (especially in the case of the Trucial States); {b) to prevent the illicit supply of arms to the inhabitants of neighbouring countries (especially in the case of Bahrain and Kuwait); (c) to prevent undue accumulations of arms in the Gulf States themselves. 4. The Certificates should state the type and quantity of arms and/or ammunition required, together with the country from which it is proposed to import them. Separate Certificates are necessary where the exporters of various items of a list are different. 5. The terms ' firearms and ammunition ' includes : — Rifles and Machine-Guns (Sporting and Military). Larger calibre guns. Shotguns. Pistols. Revolvers. Air-Rifles. Ammunition (including blank) for any of the above. Gun Powder. Spart Parts. In case of doubt, reference should be made to the Residency.215 APPENDIX D (Paragraph 43) Protocol Rules—1953 Calls Between Commanding Officers of Warships and the Authorities Ashore (Revised November 1953) A.—ROYAL NAVY 1. Frequency {a) Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the Trucial States Calls are exchanged between the Commanding Officer of a visiting ship and the political authorities ashore and the Ruler once in the tour of duty of each, except that the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, receives a call from the Ruler of Qatar on each occasion that he visits Dohah, unless he wishes to waive it on any particular occasion. ib) Muscat Calls are exchanged between the Commanding Officer of the visiting ship and the Sultan on the occasion of each visit, and between the Commanding Officer and the Consul-General, Muscat, once in the tour of duty on each (this is an informal arrangement). (c) Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Calls are exchanged between the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, and the political authorities ashore once in the term of office of each. Calls are exchanged between the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, and the Rulers on the occasion of each visit of the Commander-in-Chief. 2. Procedure {a) The junior officer according to the attached list of precedence makes the first call. Calls need not be returned on the same day. {b) The Sultan of Muscat is under no obligation to return a call in person. (c) The Rulers may, if it is convenient, send a representative to return calls of Commanding Officers junior to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Alternatively they may return calls themselves at the Political Agency, but this should be discouraged if the Ruler's health permits him to go on board. A representative returning a call receives no salute. A Ruler paying the first call should do so in person if his health allows it. 3. Arrival of Political Resident in one of Her Majesty's Ships {a) When the Political Resident arrives in one of Her Majesty's Ships, the political officer ashore should come off to the ship. If the Political Resident is to receive a salute from the land the political officer should leave the ship first and receive his salute, if any, from the ship. The Political Resident follows and receives his salute from the land. If there is no saluting gun on shore the political officer will not receive a salute from the ship, which he will leave in company with the Political Resident. If the Political Resident is travelling on one of Her Majesty's Ships he receives no salute when he leaves or returns to her. ib) Political Officers should pay or return calls on board in person (except that the Political Resident may send a deputy) and should wear uniform (summer or winter according to the orders on the subject in force at the time in the Navy),, if they have it. B.—FOREIGN WARSHIPS 1. Frequency ia) Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the Trucial States On the occasion of each visit the Commanding Officer of or Flag Officer embarked in a foreign warship should call on the Political Agent or Officer (in Bahrain, the Political Resident with the Political Agent in attendance) and the 46639 2 g 2216 Ruler. The authorities ashore should receive the call tirst in each case, though in Qatar and Sharjah as a matter of courtesy the Political Officer and Political Agent call first when the visiting officer is of Flag rank. In Bahrain which is used as a base by the United States Navy, it has became the custom, as it is in the Royal Navy, that calls should only be exchanged at the first visit. {b) Muscat The Commanding Officer of a visiting warship should call on the Sultan. He need not, but may call on Her Majesty's Consul-General as a matter of courtesy on the occasion of his first visit to Muscat. 2. Procedure {a) Except in Muscat the visiting Commanding Officer should be conducted to the Ruler by the Political Agent or Officer. {b) The same considerations apply to the return calls, by the Sultan and the Rulers as in A. 2 except that in the case of the latter the return of calls at the Political Agency is undesirable without the specific consent of the Commanding Officer concerned. C.—COMMONWEALTH WARSHIPS Commonwealth warships follow the procedure described in Section A above for ships of the Royal Navy, though care must be taken that the impression is not given that ships of the Indian Navy are in some sense Her Majesty's ships.

APPENDIX D Documents Relating to the Zubarah Dispute—1944 and 1948 (i) (Paragraph 34) Agreement of June 17, 1944, between the The Ruler of Bahrain and Ruler of Qatar agree to the restoration of friendly reiations between them as they were in the past. The Ruler of Qatar undertakes hat Zubarah will remain without anything being done in it which did not exist in the past. This is from consideration and reverence to A1 Khalifah The Ruler of Bahrain, also on his part, undertakes not to do anything that might harm the223 interest of the Ruler of Qatar. This agreement does not affect the agreement with the Oil Company in Qatar whose rights are protected. (Signed) ABDULLAH BIN QASIM AL THANl, Ruler of Qatar. (Signed) SALMAN BIN HAMAD AL KHALIFAH, Ruler of Bahrain. (ii) (Paragraph 34) Letter, dated March 2, 1948, from the Ruler of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain I have the honour to draw your attention to our meeting with the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 17th February, 1948, during which Your Excellency and our Adviser were present when we discussed the question of our and our subjects' rights in the territory of Zubarah in Qatar Peninsula: I pointed out that during the last ten years the Shaikh of Qatar possessed himself of all our property there and introduced many innovations. As you asked us to furnish details of our property and the property of our subjects in Zubarah, we give below some details pertaining to the places and other things belonging to us. We cannot adduce conclusive proofs as you did not agree to our proposal to send our men to take photographs of the places and the buildings. Further, in many cases the Shaikh of Qatar destroyed and pulled down the buildings which had been possessed by our relations and subjects before the dispute between Qatar and Bahrain rose. 1. There is the Zubarah territory which was built by our forefathers and in which exist the graves of our forefathers as well as those of 6 Shaikhs of the ruling family who were entombed near the Qal'at (castle). There are the mosques in Zubarah which were built by the Al-Khalifah, the wells, the walls of the Qal'at and the other houses extending from the Qal'at to the beach. On the beach there are the fish-traps which belong to our subjects and which were being exploited by them until the commencement of the hostilities. These fish traps which are of different kinds, are the property of our subjects—to name some of them—the Al-Bin-Ali of Muharraq and the Al-Ka'ban and others, who are residing in Halat-Um-Al-Baidh. 2. The houses which are in Mirair where fish traps are erected too. At Um-Al-Ma' there are fish traps and houses which until recently some belonged to us and some to our relations. There are also the houses belonging to the Al-Mutawwa and their families who are our subjects and who are at present living in Bahrain. 3. There are the houses and the wells in Lisha 1 which belong to us and which were built and dwelt in by our people; Fadhil bin Muhanna Ni'aimi was living there until the outbreak of the disturbances. 4. At Um-Al-Ma', Rubaijah and Furaihat there are Hadhrat (fish traps) and Masakirs (fish traps built of stone) the right of ownership of which vests in our subjects, who inherited them—son from father. 5. We are the rightful owners of the wells which are in Zubarah, Lisha', Halwan and in Masikah; they were dug out and utilised by us for land cultivation. All these places are known to all the Arabs both in Bahrain and Qatar and we do not believe that there is anybody who denies their having been in our possession before the dispute. Some of our relations resided in these places and erected fish traps as they did during the time the Al-Khalifah were living at Zubarah. Before this dispute we had not been noticing any interference on the part of the Shaikh of Qatar and we as well as our subjects, had been faring across between Bahrain and Zubarah with complete freedom, and without any obstacle rising in our way. Nor had ever been any dispute over our rights before this incident—when we wanted men in Bahrain we used to fetch them from Zubarah. Those who lives in Zubarah were subject to our rule. We and our subjects used to travel between Bahrain and Zubarah with full freedom and every year to send our cattle to Zubarah for grazing there without any tax or demurrage being levied or permission being obtained for going or coming, the reason being that for a hundred and odd years the Al-Khalifah ruled over Zubarah and Bahrain. We on our part did not cause any harm to the Shaikh of Qatar and his subjects. 46639 2 h 2224 6. We respected and compiied with the terms ot the agreement we agreed upon through His Excellency the Political Agent and which we signed on the 23rd June, 1944, after it had been signed by the Shaikh of Qatar. But the Shaikh of Qatar has not fulfilled his obligation. 7. We acted according to the agreemeht; but the Ruler of Qatar did not care for it; and we made complaints to you in this respect. We therefore request you to settle this case as soon as you can. (iii) (Paragraph 34) Letter, dated June 24, 1948, from the Ruler of Bahrain to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs The following is what I am still prepared to do: — {a) To define, as is shown on the map herewith, the area of Zubarah. To hold this land and what is on it in free use by my family, my adherents and my subjects. {b) To hold the land so defined as in private ownership for ever, (c) To surrender to the Shaikh of Qatar or otherwise renounce all oil rights in the Zubara area; in this connexion I would like to point out that I have never at any time claimed such rights there. id) Subject to my seeing the oil concession Agreement between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Petroleum Concessions Limited to respect the provisions of that Agreement so that all its benefits, entirely, go to the Shaikh of Qatar. (e) To obtain the surrender by the Bahrain Petroleum Company of any claims they have or may have in Zubara under the concession which they hold from me in my territories. if) To continue, as now and as before, to allow Petroleum Concessions Limited freedom to conduct its business in my country and to buy water from here and carry it to Qatar. In this connection I hope that ways may be found to provide enough water for the needs of the Company in Qatar, without exposing my country to detriment or bad consequences, by pipes from Bahrain. (g) In return for this fair offer I require to obtain the rights of my family, my adherents and my subjects at Zubara including freedom and security for their lives and property similar to the conditions which they enjoyed at Zubara prior to the dispute in 1936. APPENDIX E (Paragraph 43) Delimitatioii of the Bahrain-Qatar Sea -bed Boundary—1947 Letter, dated December 23 1947, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Ruler of Bahrain I am instructed by the Honourable the Political Resident to inform Your Highness that His Majesty's Government has, for some time past, had under consideration the boundary which should delimit Your Highness's rights in the bed of the sea lying between the territory of Your Highness and that of His Excellency the Shaikh of Qatar. Apart from any other considerations the operations of the Oil Companies in Your Highness's and His Excellency the Shaikh of Qatar's territory make such a delimitation necessary. 2. I am, therefore, to forward herewith for your Highness's information a copy of a map showing the line (from point ' M ' to the ' Bahrain Light Vessel') which. His Majesty's Government considers, divides in accordance with equitable principles the sea-bed aforesaid. This is a median line based generally on the configuration of the coast-line of the Bahrain main island and the peninsula of Qatar. 3. With the exceptions noted below His Majesty's Government will in future regard all the sea-bed lying to the west of this line as being under the sovereisntv of Your Highness and all the sea-bed lying to the east of it as being under the225 not tor Ruler oj sovereignty of His Excellency the Shaikh of Qatar. This decision covers the sea-bed only and not the waters above it and is without prejudice to existing navigation rights. 4. The exceptions referred to above are: — Your Highness is recognised as having sovereign rights in: — (i) the areas of the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals which are above the spring tide low-water level. After a full examination ot the position under international law, His Majesty's Government are of opinion that these shoals should not be considered to be islands having territorial waters. (ii) Hawar Island, the islands of the Hawar group and the territorial waters pertaining thereto and delimited again in accordance with the usual principles of international law. These islands and their territorial waters are shown on the map enclosed by the line A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L. As this delimitation will, however, leave a narrow tongue of water (formed by the points M. J. and I.) pertaining to Qatar it has been decided to alter the line H, I, J, to H, P, Q, thus exchanging an equal area P, I, O, for O, J, Q. It should be noted that Janan Island is not regarded as being included in the islands of the Hawar group. 5. The points mentioned are defined as follows: — Position True Bearing Nautical Miles From A 015° 3-00 N. point of Rabadh I. B 056i o 3-20 N.E. corner of Ajaira 1. C 064° 2-06 E. corner of No. 3 Al Wakara I. D 058° 1-14 E. corner of No. 3 Al Wakara I. E 1631° 1-23 E. corner of No. 3 Al Wakara I. F 141° 0-81 No. 9 Bu Sa'ada I. G 168° 1-20 No. 9 Bu Sa'ada I.

(a) 061i o (b) 046, 10 6. The assigned positions of (a) the North Sitra Light Buoy, and (b) the Bahrain Light Vessel should be: — true 15*20 Nautical Miles, and, ^ true 28-05 Nautical Miles from the Political Agent's flagstaff, Latitude 26° 14' -1 N., Longitude 50° 35' -2 E. (approximately), as the positions of floating marks are subject to frequent alteration. The other points on the main dividing line should be defined as K. 104° true 9* 53 Nautical Miles, and M. 180° true 18-03 Nautical Miles from the Triangulation Station No. 102 at Ras al Barr. 7. I am to add that this division has been made on the basis of the maps and information at present available and detailed application of the principles of the division is subject to revision in the event of more exact geographical data being forthcoming at a later date. 8. The Managers of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited, are being informed of the contents of this letter. Note. —A similar letter was addressed to the Ruler of Qatar. APPENDIX F (Paragraph 56) Resume of Discussions held in London with the Amir Faisal about the Submarine Areas, Islands and Shoals between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain—1951 A. It has been agreed to divide the submarine areas between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain by a line to be drawn in accordance with equitable principles between the two countries. As an example the British delegation has2 &gt; &gt; ti , 226 submitted a map showing its view regarding the method of establishing the line, and the Saudi delegation has submitted a special map showing its view regarding the drawing of the line. B. The British delegation has submitted a recommendation, the effect of which would be for Lubainah al-Kabirah, Lubainah al-Saghirah, and Fasht Abu Safah to be considered as belonging to Bahrain, and for Rennie Shoals to be given to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. C. The Saudi delegation has submitted a recommendation in which Lubainah al-Saghirah is considered as belonging to Bahrain, Lubainah al-Kabirah to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Fasht Abu Safah to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Rennie Shoals to Bahrain. It has been agreed that after settlement of the appurtenance of Lubainah al-Kabirah, Lubainah al Saghirah, Fasht Abu Safah, and Rennie Shoals, and after the drawing of the line, the submarine areas, reefs, shoals, and islands on the side of the line towards Bahrain shall be considered to belong to Bahrain, and the submarine areas, reefs, shoals and islands on the other side of the line towards the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia shall be considered to belong to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. E. Each of the parties has reserved its position. APPENDIX G Correspondence concerning British jurisdiction in Bahrain—1909 and 1952 (i) (Paragraph 108) Letter dated July 16, 1909, from the Ruler of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain It is not hidden from you that I have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) m my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason 1 wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases and I would be grateful to the British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exercise authority in all cases in which foreigners only are concerned, but not in other cases; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that vou and I should settle them jointly. ^ (') (Paragraph 109) Letter dated April 19. 1952, from the Pol Bahrain 1 am writing to inform you that Her Majesty's Government are able to to your request that with effect from the 1st May, 1952.

We express our thanks to Her Majesty's Government and we confirm our agreement to the arrangement mentioned in your letter. APPENDIX H Correspondence about facilities for the Royal Navy—1934 and 1935 (i) (Paragraph 112) Letter dated April 16, 1934, from the Ruler of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain With reference to our conversations with you and the Honourable the Political Resident regarding the purchase of certain lands in Muharraq, Jufair and Qudhaibiyah {i.e., Manamah area) of the Bahrain Islands for the use of the British Government. I inform you that whole matter is now completed and send to you herewith four title deeds of the ownership of the said lands, which have been duly registered in the Bahrain Government Land Department, and they bear my seal which shows that I have approved of the purchase of aforesaid lands by the British Government. Those persons who owned property within the areas have been compensated by us by money and land. 2. Further, I agree that the British Government may have the use of the foreshore adjacent to the aforesaid lands and may construct a pier and any other work, provided that if any of the fish traps which are owned by our subjects are affected the British Government will pay compensation to the owners.' Also I give my assurance that no permission will be given to any one to construct any building on the shore or the land adjacent to the aforesaid land which might spoil the land belonging to the British Government without previous agreement between us and the British Government. 3. I am glad to be of assistance to the British Government, and I welcome this opportunity of being of help to His Majesty King George of England who is our friend and whose ancestors have been the friends of my ancestors since the Khalifah have ruled over Bahrain Islands. I always pray for his long life and prosperity and I hope that in the future I may have the opportunity of again presenting myself before His Majesty in England. (ii) (Paragraph 113) Letter, dated April 2, 1935, from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to the Ruler of Bahrain I have the honour to confirm our conversation of yesterday, in which I mtormed Your Excellency that the High British Government desired to transfer their Naval recreational centre and station from the Persian Coast to Bahrain. Your Excellency was pleased to intimate that you entirely welcomed this transfer. (iii) (Paragraph 113) Letter, dated April 2, J935, from the Ruler of Bahrain to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf I was very glad to receive your kind letter No. C/61 of 1935 confirming our conversation of yesterday, in which you informed me that the High British228 Government desired to transfer their Naval recreational ^ from the Persian Coast to Bahrain. I welcome this transfer with great pleasure. am also very glad and pleased at this (transfer). (iv) (Paragraph 113) Letter from the Ruler of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain, dated Safar 1, 1354 (May 1935) We write to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 167/V.O. dated 22 n d April 1935 enclosing a copy from the letter of our friend Capt. J. V. Creagh, U.a.u., A.D.C., to you. - We understand that Captain Creagh wishes you to request us to grant certain concessions and privileges to the officers and crews of the Navy who have made their recreational centre and depot at Jufair. We are glad that the navy has come to Bahrain and we are pleased to give them the facilities which are possible. But we observe that the concession which Captain Creagh is demanding amount to everything. He demands from us that we should waive our rights of taking customs duty on all imports for the navy and this is more than possible. The Royal Air Force pay customs duty and we think the navy should pay also. We agree however to make certain concessions. There is also the matter of alcoholic liquors. It is not hidden from you that this in an Islamic State and the use of alcoholic liquors is forbidden and we do not approve of its use in Bahrain and we have ordered our police to prevent it. Nobody has permission to buy liquors except special persons who have permission to buy it for their own use according to the regulations which we have laid down on this subject. The use of alcoholic liquors in Bahrain would make a bad hearing among other Islamic countries and it is a bad example to the people. As regards the navy, however, we are willing to permit them to use alcoholic liquors inside their own buildings and also the officers may use all liquors inside their own building but we cannot allow the use of alcoholic liquors in any other place nor must it be given or sold to other people than the Navy. We remind you that we regard this matter as a matter of great importance and we hope that the navy will carry out our wishes according to our regulations. We will not take customs duty on the alcoholic liquors which are used by the sailors and officers, but we remind you that the customs duty on alcoholic liquors is 15 per cent. Also we will not take customs duty on foodstuffs which are used in the canteen or in the officers' building. In addition to this help to the navy we are willing not to take customs duty on the furniture of the official office at Jufair and on the materials needed for it. Regarding stores of the Government we cannot agree that all Government stores should be imported freely without customs duty but we agree that things which are imported into Bahrain and are sent to the ships shall not pay customs duty, but all things which are not sent to the ships but are used at Jufair will pay customs duty in the usual way. We are willing to give all this help because we are glad to help the British Government at all times. We do this freely of our own accord and we do not think that it is right that we should be asked to give up more from our revenue. (v) (Paragraph 113) Letter from the Ruler of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain, dated June 13 1935 We understand from our Adviser that the British Navy will not agree to pay customs duty to us on the imports mentioned in paragraphs 9 and 10 of our letter dated the 1st Safar 1953. As you are aware we waived our rights to customs duties on all imports for the Navy except those mentioned above so nothing else remains for us and now we are obliged to agree to the wishes of the British Government in this matter. We wish however to inform you that this matter is not a auestion of money but it is a question of principle. *229 APPENDIX I Correspondence about Facilities for the Royal Air Force—1934 and 1938 (i) (Paragraph 115) Letter, dated June 5 1934, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Ruler of Bahrain With reference to the Agreement signed by Your Excellency on the subject of the use of your aerodrome by civil aircraft, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty's Government expect that Military aircraft belonging to or employed in the service of His Majesty shall at all times enjoy priority, when His Majesty's Government consider that circumstances require it, in the use of any aerodromes which may be established or maintained for civil aircraft, and of all facilities, without specific prior permission, and that use of such aerodromes shall be accorded free of charge.

On these two points I can inform Your Highness that the men employed will be under the same discipline as other members of the British armed forces in Bahrain and that their numbers will not exceed the minimum necessary to carry out those administrative duties which I have described. 7. I should be grateful if Your Highness would be so good as to confirm the agreement to this proposal which you expressed to me orally.

I am instructed by Her Majesty's Government to confirm that they consider that the arrangements described in the letter and the enclosures are satisfactory for the purpose for which they are intended. I am also instructed by Her Majesty's Government to confirm that the income which will arise from sterling investments made by the Investment Board on Your Highness' behalf will not be liable to United Kingdom Income Tax.

APPENDIX D Correspondence on the Demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait Frontier—1940 and 1951 (i) (Paragraph 45) Letter, dated October 7 1940, from His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad, to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs 1 have the honour to inform you that my Government consider it desirable that the frontier between Iraq and Koweit should be demarcated and I have recewed instructions to propose to the Iraqi Government that arrangements should be made to do this at an early date.J t2; 247 2. With this end in view. His Majesty's Government suggest that there should be an exchange of notes providing that the work of demarcating the frontier and erecting pillars should be carried out in a manner similar to that laid down in the notes exchanged for the same purpose between the Iraqi and Saudi Arabian Governments in February 1938. In order, however, to avoid difficulties which might otherwise arise, His Majesty's Government think it desirable that the proposed notes should include agreement on the interpretation of certain points in the wording of the definition of the frontier as reaffirmed by the Prime Minister in his letter to the High Commissioner No. 2944 of July 21st, 1932. 3. In that letter the definition of the frontiers was reaffirmed in the following terms: — ' From the intersection of the Wadi al Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Jebel Sanam and Um Qasr leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah. The islands of Warba, Bubian, Maskan (or Mashjan) Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar Qaru and Um el Maradin appertain to Koweit.' 4. The points to be interpreted and the interpretation which it is suggested should be given to them are as follows: — (1) ' Along the Batin ' the frontier line shall follow the thalweg, i.e., the line of the deepest depression. (2) The ' point just South of the latitude of Safwan ' shall be the point on the thalweg of the Batin due West of the point a little to the South of Safwan at which the post and notice-board marking the frontier stood until March 1939. (3) From the Batin to the neighbourhood of Safwan the frontier shall be a line along the parallel of latitude on which stands the above- mentioned point at which the post and notice-board formerly stood. (4) The ' junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah ' shall mean the junction of the thalweg of the Khor Zubair with the thalweg of the north-westerly arm of the Khor Abdullah known as the Khor Shetana. (5) From the neighbourhood of the Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah the frontier shall be the shortest line between the point defined in sub-paragraph (2) and the point defined in sub-paragraph (4). But if this line shall be found, when followed on the ground to strike the right bank of the Khor Zubair before it reaches the point defined in sub-paragraph (4), it shall be modified in such a manner as to follow the low water line on the right bank of the Khor Zubair until a point on the bank immediately opposite the point defined in sub-paragraph (4) is reached, thus leaving the whole of the Khor Zubair to Iraq. (6) From the point defined in sub-paragraph (4) to the open sea the boundary shall follow the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah. 5. In the hope that Your Excellency will agree in principle with my Government's view of the advantage to both the Iraqi and Koweiti Governments of a demarcation of their common frontier, I am enclosing, as a basis for discussion, a draft of a Note which I suggest Your Excellency should, on behalf of the Iraqi Government, address to me. I will then endeavour to obtain, through the proper channel, the formal agreement of His Highness the Ruler of Koweit to these proposals. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (ii) (Paragraph 51) Note Verbale, dated December J8 1951, from His Majesty's Embassy, Bagdad, to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs His Britannic Majesty's Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has the honour to state that His Britannic Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have had under consideration the question 46639 2 l 2248 of the demarcation of the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait. In July 1948 His Excellency Sayid Jalal Baban, who was then Acting Prime Minister oi Iraq, informed Sir Henry Mack, then His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador, that the Iraq Government were about to reopen this whole question with His Britannic Majesty's Government. No written communication has been received by His Britannic Majesty's Embassy on this subject and the Embassy has accordingly been instructed to inform the Iraq Government of His Britannic Majesty s Governments views on the exact line of the frontier and to make certain proposals about the demarcation of the frontier. In his letter No. 2944 of the 21st July, 1932, to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Iraq the then Prime Minister of Iraq defined the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait as follows: — ' From the intersection of the Wadi el Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan Wells, Jebel Sanam and Umm Qasr leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah. The islands of Warbah, Bubuyan, Maskan (or Mashjan), Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru and Um-el-Maradim appertain to Kuwait.' His Britannic Majesty's Government interpret this definition of the frontier as follows: — {a) ' Along the Batin ' means that the line of the frontier shall follow the thalweg, i.e., the line of the deepest depression. {b) The ' point just south of the latitude of Safwan ' means the point on the thalweg of the Batin due west of the point 1,000 metres due south of the customs post at Safwan, i.e., the building which on the 25th June, 1940, was used as the customs post at Safwan. (c) From the Batin to the neighbourhood of Safwan the frontier shall be the line along the parallel of latitude between the two points described in sub-paragraph {b) above. {d) The ' junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah ' means the junction of the thalweg of the Khor Zubair with the thalweg of the north-westerly arm of the Khor Abdullah known as the Khor Stetana. (e) From the point 1,000 metres south of the customs post at Safwan the frontier shall follow the shortest line between that point and the point defined in sub-paragraph (d) above (the ' junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah '), but only as far as the spring tide low-water mark on the right bank of the Khor Zubair. if) From the point of the spring tide low-water mark on the right bank of the Khor Zubair mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph to the point on that same low-water mark nearest to the' point defined in sub-paragraph (d) above (the ' junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah ') the frontier shall follow the low-water mark, (g) From the point on the low-water mark on the right bank of the Khor Zubair nearesi to the point defined in sub-paragraph (d) above (the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah ') to that point itself the frontier shall be the shortest line which can be drawn. ih) From the point defined in sub-paragraph id) above (the ' junction of the Khor Zubmr wtb tbe Khor Abdullah'') to the open sea the frontier »ui (P [T' ' thalweg of the north-westerly arm of the Khor Abdiillah knowri as the tChor Shetana and then 'the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah proper. 6 ijje arrangements teCan^Ii'SmaUon* 0 !iSoSr'shSild telSa' Affairs.

It shall be permissible, in case of necessity, for the second representative to replace and enjoy the same privileges as the first representative. The first representative of each country shall preside alternately over the work of the Commission. (/) In case of differences between the representatives, they shall submit the question in dispute to their Governments with a view to a solution being reached through the diplomatic channel. (g) The proces verbaux of the Commission shall be prepared in Arabic and English and, in case of difference, the English text shall prevail. {h) The date on which the Joint Commission shall begin work shall be fixed by agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government. (/) It is confirmed that the costs of demarcation shall be shared equally between the Governments of Kuwait and Iraq. His Britannic Majesty's Embassy look forward to receiving in due course the views of the Iraq Government on the proposals set forth above. His Britannic Majesty's Embassy avails itself of this opportunity to renew the expression of its highest consideration. APPENDIX E (Paragraph 63) Resume of discussions held in London with the Amir Faisal about the islands claimed by Kuwait—1951 Islands A.—The Saudi Arabian Government has not recognised any claim of Kuwait to the islands which it claims. B.—The British delegation has submitted a recommendation that Kuwait should relinguish all the islands which the British Government formerly claimed on behalf of Kuwait on condition that the Saudi Arabian Government should recognise al-Farisiyah as belonging to Kuwait. C.—His Royal Highness has promised to lay this recommendation before His Majesty. APPENDIX F (Paragraph 80) Letter, dated July 21 1947, from the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait, regarding his rights in Kuwait Bay We would like to inform you that we find it necessary to inform the Kuwait Oil Company that the territory of the State of Kuwait includes Kuwait's Bay, the mouth of which extends from a line drawn from the low water mark at Ras al-Ardh to a position at low water mark on the opposite coast in latitude 29° 27' lO^ N longitude 48° 14' OO^ E, the limit of the territorial waters being a line 3 nautical miles to the seaward and parallel to this base line. We therefore request you to inform the Kuwait Oil Company accordingly.250 APPENDIX G (Paragraph 89) Letter, dated April 211935, from the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, undertaking to consult His Majesty's Government before granting oil concessions in the Neutral Zone With the hand of loyalty I have received your letter No. 284-S dated the 7th Muharram 1354 (11,4.35), and I thank Your Excellency for what you have stated regarding the instructions issued by His Majesty's Government in respect of the concessions that are likely to be given in my State. I beg, therefore, to inform Your Excellency that 1 am always gratified and honoured to have received His Majesty's Government's commands, and as I have intimated to Your Excellency in my letter No. R-4/2009 dated 21st April 1935, I hold very tight to my homage and obediance to the wishes of His Majesty's Government and it is of deep import to me to continue to acquire their satisfaction and favour always. As regards the directions under which you require me not to grant concessions of any kind, nor to negotiate with any party in regard to any such concessions, except after I have obtained the approval of His Majesty's Government—I beg to inform Your Excellency that in the question relating to any oil concession in the Neutral Zone, I hold entirely to what I have already promised you, and shall act in strict accordance with what this (my promise) requires of me and shall let you know the result in secret. As regards concessions other than this, in view of the old and friendly bonds which exist between His Majesty's Government and myself, I do not think that it is His Majesty's Government's intention or desire to restrain or prevent me from enjoying any advantage or benefits that can be derived from my country and lands, such for instance as concessions connected with the shipment of sand, shingle, shells, rock, gypsum, wool as well as ice, electricity and many other similar things, none of which involves any inconsistency (with my treaty engagements). I, on the other hand, am quite confident that His Majesty's Government has got no other purpose in mind but my and my country's welfare and good. Nor would they, I feel sure, agree to anything that would bind and unfairly deprive me of such benefits and advantages. Seeing therefore that we are independent, under the shade of His Majesty's Government's protection and goodwill, and seeing that we are holding tight to every single thing that helps to confirm this fact in every way, we cannot see our way to agree to the abovementioned directions, except in so far as they concern any oil concessions in the Neutral Zone, for we believe we have absolute liberty in our land.

As I have informed your Excellency, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom approve of your proposal that the Iraq Government should open private negotiations with the sheikhs for the purchase of their properties in Iraq. It is possible, however, that these negotiations may not have reached finality before the time comes for me to communicate the above list to the Iraq Government. In such event. His Majesty's Government propose to insert mention of the obligation towards the sheikhs in the list, but at the same time to append a footnote to the effect that private negotiations are proceeding with a view to the liquidation of this obligation, and that, if these are unsuccessful, the question will need to be discussed further between the two Governments. I shall be glad to learn from your Excellency that this procedure will be acceptable to the Iraq Government, I have, &amp;c. F.

I have the honour to inform your Excellency in reply that the procedure indicated in the second paragraph of your letter is acceptable to the Iraq Government. I have, &amp;c. NOURY SAID. (iv) (Paragraph 135) Letter, dated July 8 1936, from His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs For some years past, and more especially since the establishment of Iraq as an independent State, it has been the constant endeavour of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to arrive at an agreed solution, with the Iraqi Government, of the problems arising from the properties in Iraq belonging to the Shaikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. 2. In 1914, His Majesty's Government pledged their word that these properties would remain in the possession of the Shaikhs and their descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts. These pledges have been, and continue to be matters of no little concern to His Majesty's Government, who are anxious that arrangements should be made, with the consent and good will of the Iraqi Government, whereby full effect may be given to them as soon as possible. 3. Many proposals with this end in view have been discussed between our respective Governments but have proved abortive, and His Majesty's Government have now decided that the time has arrived to make a fresh attempt, without prejudice to the views which they and the Iraqi Government have hitherto expressed, to overcome, in a practical manner, the difficulties that have arisen. 4. On this basis, as a result of prolonged and careful examination, His Majesty's Government have now prepared new proposals which involve very considerable concessions to the views of the Iraqi Government, and to which I have the honour to invite Your Excellency's favourable attention. 5. The problems involved concern: — id) the possession of the actual areas in question; ib) taxation. 6. As regards (b), the proposals of His Majesty s Government are the following. They are prepared to make no further claim against the Iraqi Government for the exemption of the properties of the two shaikhs from taxation in Iraq, provided that the Iraqi Government will, for their part, (a) give a formal undertaking, in writing, to make no claim for arrears ot taxation against either shaikh in respect of their properties in Iraq, and (b) provide a formal written assurance that no discriminatory taxation will be imposed upon the properties of either in future. 7. As icgards the possession aspect of the matter. His Majesty's Government P u 0p ?i e ' aS t 11 inte § ra ^ P art a comprehensive settlement, that all uncertainties should now be removed in regard to the boundaries of the shaikhs' lands in Iraq fu f ^ . e f awa ^ed to them, through the application, to the areas in which May^^r^^^p 113 procedure laid down in the Land Settlement Law of8. With this end in view, His Majesty's Government suggest that the Iraqi Government should immediately declare the areas in question as a settlement area in accordance with the law above quoted, and that a British Land Settlement Officer should be detailed, as soon as possible, to carry out the whole procedure of Land Settlement as specified by the law. This would mean that, after a full and impartial investigation including outside claims (account being taken of all the circumstances, as provided in Article 13 of the law), the boundaries of the lands in question would be delimited by a decision of the Land Settlement Officer and subsequently registered by the Tapu Department, under Article 20 of the law. His Majesty's Government assume that such orders as may be necessary will be issued by the proper authorities to ensure that the Shaikhs' non-Iraqi nationality will constitute no impediment or delay to the completion of the registration. 9. An obvious advantage of these proposals is that the result of their application would be to safeguard the rights of all Iraqi subjects, while preventing the recurrence of unfounded claims against the Shaikhs. Article 32 of the Land Settlement Law provides that, within a settlement area, during the period of settlement, no case concerning any matter touching the settlement of rights in land shall be heard in any court other than the special court provided for in the law. His Majesty's Government are aware of the decision of the Court of Cassation delivered on October 29th, 1934, in Appeal Case No. 8 of 1934, where by Article 32 of the Land Settlement Law was declared to apply to all suits, whether brought before or after the application of that law to the area in which the lands are situated; so that all pending suits are, by the operation of the law, transferred to the Land Settlement Officer. I shall be grateful to be assured that the suits now pending in the Basra Courts in respect of the lands of the Shaikh of Koweit will remain stayed until the transfer to the Land Settlement Officer can take place under Article 32 referred to above. 10. The possibility of further litigation against the Shaikh of Koweit would be confined to appeals to the special court set up by virtue of Article 4 of the law against the decision of the Land Settlement Officer. These are permitted within a maximum period of forty days (Article 23 of the law). His Majesty's Government suggest that, for the convenience of all concerned, the special court be set up in Basra under the presidency of the President of the Civil Courts there. 11. His Majesty's Government fully realise that the application of land settlement to specified properties in the Basra liwa may interfere with the general course of land settlement now in operation. They are also aware that it would necessitate a special survey of the properties being carried out on a scale of not less than 1 / 20,000. In view, however, of the obvious advantages of the course proposed as a means of overcoming the difficulties that have arisen, they feel convinced that the Iraqi Government will not allow administrative questions of detail to stand in the way. They presume that survey operations could not be begun before the end of the hot weather and they would be glad to learn that the Iraqi Government concur in their proposals and that arrangements will accordingly be made for the survey to be undertaken as soon as possible. 12. His Majesty's Government are prepared to abide by the decisions of the Land Settlement Officer as to the boundaries of the lands in question and by any modifications of these decision which may result from subsequent appeals to the special court provided for by the law. They are further prepared to undertake not to make any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of any changes which may result to the present boundaries of the Shaikh's lands in consequence of the land settlement procedure. 13. As the case of the Shaikh of Koweit is the more urgent of the two, it is proposed that land settlement procedure should be applied to his properties first, and that the application of the procedure to the properties of the Shaikh of Mohammerah should be undertaken immediately afterwards. 14. Your Excellency will, I trust, agree that His Majesty's Government have gone a long way towards meeting the Iraqi point of view and that they are giving evidence of their confidence in the good will of Your Excellency's Government, as well as of their own desire for a fair and lasting solution. 15. The present proposals of His Majesty's Government are intended to form a new point of departure in this complicated matter. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. 46639 2 M254 (v) (Paragraph 135) Letter, dated November 3 1938, from the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, to His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad The proposals concerning the properties in Iraq claimed by the Shaikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah which were contained in Mr. C. H. Bateman's Note No. 347 of 8th July, 1936, addressed to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, A1 Saiyid Nuri A1 Said, have now received the careful consideration of the Iraqi Government. 2. The Iraqi Government are disposed to accept these proposals, subject to the following: — 3. With regard to sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 6 of Mr. Bateman's Note, legislation must be passed before the undertaking can be given. The Iraqi Government are prepared to propose such legislation and, on its coming into force, to give the undertaking requested. 4. With regard to sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 6, the British Government may rest assured that the Iraqi Government have no intention of imposing discriminatory taxation on the property of any person in Iraq. Furthermore, the British Government must be aware that such taxation would be in conflict with the provisions of the Iraqi Constitution. The Iraqi Government do not, therefore, consider it proper or necessary for any further assurance to be given by them in this connexion. 5. With regard to paragraph 8 the Iraqi Government confirm tliat the nationality of the two shaikhs shall constitute no impediment or delay to the completion of the registration of the properties which may be awarded to them in accordance with the provisions of the Land Settlement Law. 6. The Iraqi Government are prepared to give the assurance mentioned in paragraph 9 on the basis oi the Land Settlement Law or the Regulations issued thereunder. 7. With regard to paragraph 10, it is necessary to point out that Article 25 (b) of the Land Settlement Law provides that all judgments of the Special Court are subject to appeal to the Court of Cassation on points of law. The Iraqi Government cannot, therefore, confine litigation against the Shaikh of Koweit to appeals, against the decisions of the Land Settlement Officer, to the Special Court set up by virtue of Article 4 of the Law. n • re g ar d to paragraph 12, it follows from paragraph 7 above that the British Government should recognise the decision of the Court of Cassation as well as the decisions of the Land Settlement Officer and the Special Court, and that the British Government s undertaking not to object to any changes which may result to he present boundaries of the Shaikhs' lands in consequence of the land rf th™CourtCfcas?atTo U n St eXtend t0 changes whic,1 may result from an y decisions 9.

I am glad to be able to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have accepted the terms of your reply to the proposals communicated by Mr. Bateman in his note No. 347 of the 8th July, 1936, to His Excellency A1 Saiyid Nuri Said, and hope that the appropriate Iraqi authorities will now take early action to apply Land Settlement procedure to the area in which the properties in question are situated. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (vii) (Paragraph 136) Discharge Signed by the Ruler of Kuwait, dated May 1 J940 I, the undersigned on my own behalf and on behalf of all other persons having any right or interest in the estate of the late Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait do hereby acknowledge the receipt of the sum of £30,694 paid to me on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and 1 accept this payment in full settlement and discharge, binding equally on me, my heirs and successors, and on the other heirs and successors of Shaikh Mubarak with their heirs or successors, of any claims which we or our heirs or successors have made or may make upon, and of the liability of, that Government, in respect of the pledge given to Shaikh Mubarak in 1914, to compensate us for the loss which we suffered up to and including the year 1939, or which we or our heirs or successors may suffer there after, by reason of the Istihlak or any other tax levied on landed property or agricultural production in respect of lands which we hold in Iraq as heirs and successors of Shaikh Mubarak, and in view of this payment made to me, for myself and for the other heirs and successors, I hereby guarantee His Majesty's Government against any liability towards the heirs and successors of Shaikh Mubarak in respect of such taxation. (viii) (Paragraph 137) Letter, dated August 24 1941, from the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad Your Excellency, In referring to Your Excellency's letter No. 324 dated 29th June, 1941, I have pleasure in stating that I am in a position to confirm the verbal assurance, made by His Excellency Saiyid Taufiq al Suwaidi, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, that article 1 (2) of the Law Amending Land Claims Settlement Law, No. 26 of 1941, is intended to cover the Shaikhs of Kuweit and Muhammarah, and there is nothing in the law to affect the arrangements agreed upon as per Mr. Bateman's letter No. 347 dated 8th July, 1936, addressed to His Excellency the Foreign Minister and the Minister's letter in reply dated 30th October, 1938. I avail myself of the opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the expression of my highest respect.

APPENDIX K Correspondence regarding British jurisdiction in Kuwait—1925 and 1952 (i) (Paragraph 167) Letter, dated November / 1925, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Ruler of Kuwait With reference to Your Excellency's letter of yesterday's date, I regret that my letter No. 342 dated the 24th October 1925 was not clear to Your Excellency, and that, even after our conversation on Wednesday evening, Your Excellency still seems to entertain some doubts as to the real objects of the Order in Council which has been issued. I am accordingly repeating the main points in other words, and I hope that by doing so I will remove these doubts. In the first place 1 wish to make it perfectly clear that the powers conferred on me by this Order in Council do not extend to the subjects of any Muslim Government, such as Persians, Nejdis, &amp;c., all of whom are considered for the purpose of jurisdiction as the same as Your Excellency's own subjects. The only Foreigners with whom I am in any way concerned are the subjects and protected persons of Non-Muslim Governments, such as America, France, Italy, Portugal, &amp;c., and in their case, if any question should arise, I am sure Your Excellency would prefer that it should be dealt with by the representative of His Majesty's Government rather than by yourself. To reiterate: the powers conferred on me do extend to: — (a) British subjects and protected persons. (b) The subjects and protected persons of non-Muslim Foreign Governments. (c) Kuwait subjects, or the subjects of other Muslim Governments, registered in my office as being regularly employed by British subjects, or the subjects of non-Muslim Foreign Governments. Such people must, 1 am sure you will agree, be considered as under the protection of His Majesty's Government. It is laid down in the Order in Council, however, that if a Kuwait subject desires to institute a complaint against a British subject, or the subject of a non-Muslim Foreign Power, 1 can either decide tne case in my own court, or. if both are Muslims and agree, have the case referred to the Qadhi for decision. Similarly if British subject or the subject of a non-Muslim Foreign Government complains against a Kuwait subject, I shall ask your Excellency to decide the case, and it is specially provided that employed Kuwait subjects shall be dealt with in the same way as other Kuwait subjects in this respect. In cases in which Kuwait subjects and employed Kuwait subjects are concerned, however, as the latter are under British protection lor the time being, I think you will aeree that they have to have the same privileges in this respect as other British subjects, and, as shown above, they lose no privileges as Kuwait subjects. ,1 ^ t , hink ^ abo y e ™ 11 re f mo . ve th f doubts from your mind and show you that the Order in Council will not injure the rights of anyone, and I shall be grateful if you will let me know if this is so. 5257 (ii) (Paragraph 167) Letter, dated November 3 J925, from the Ruler oj Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait 1 beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 360, dated the 1st November 1925, containing an explanation of what you said in your former letter, No. 342, dated the 24th October 1925, and in our conversation of last Wednesday evening relative to the judicial powers conferred on the Political Agent, Kuwait, by His Majesty's Order in Council over British subjects and British protected persons, the subjects of and persons under the protection of Foreign Governments, and such persons as are registered in the Political Agency from among Kuwait subjects and the subjects of Muslim and Foreign Governments. I now clearly understand its objects, and have no objection to it. I thank you for explaining it to me, and hope that it will lead to justice and concord. (iii) (Paragraph 167) Letter, dated November 4 1925, from the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait Regarding the exercise of jurisdiction over the subjects and protected persons of all non-Muslim Foreign Governments in Kuwait by the representative of His Majesty's Government. 1 agree to this. (iv) (Paragraph 169) Letter, dated January 8 1952, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Ruler of Kuwait I have the honour to draw your Highness' attention to the clause in the Kuwait Order in Council which defines ' Kuwait subject' and which, therefore, for practical purposes defines the jurisdiction of Your Highness. It reads as follows: — '' Kuwait subject ' means a subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait and any person, not being a British Subject, who is the national of any other Moslem state.' I am to point out that, as Your Highness is doubtless aware, the expression ' Moslem state ' in this context is imprecise and I am to ask your agreement to replacing the clause quoted by another defining the extent of Your Highness' jurisdiction as covering nationals of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Persia, Syria, Egypt, the Lebanon, the Yemen, Muscat and Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Trucial States and stateless Moslems of Palestinian origin.

APPENDIX P (Paragraph 201) Minute on Postal Arrangements between Kuwait and Iraq, dated March 5 1953 The arrangements outlined in General Post Office letter (Ref. 70145/46/57) of 13th December, 1952, were discussed between his Excellency Abdul Baqi Abdullah and Colonel E. W. Wood in Bagdad. The following is a summary of the conclusions reached : — General: The detailed working arrangements are to be as simple as possible. Postage Rates: There will be no practical difficulty in the exchange of correspondence charged at the ' inland ' rates of the countries of origin. (Iraq will advise the General Post Office of her rates when notifying formal acceptance of the proposals.) Terminal Charges: Each administration will accept parcels from the other for delivery within Kuwait or Iraq as the case may be without raising terminal charges. Mails—Documentation: Mails will continue to be documented as at present (parcels to be listed individually) but they will be excluded from international statistics. Letter Mails—Make Up: Each administration will make up direct bags or labelled bundles for independent addresses within the other's postal territory. Changes in circulation arrangements from time to time will be arranged between the offices of the Director-General P. &amp; T. Iraq and the Postal Superintendent, Persian Gulf Postal Agencies, Bahrain. Registered Items—Compensation for Loss, &amp;c.: Each administration will continue to be responsible for the payment of compensation in respect of losses, &amp;c., occurring within its own territory. Air Mails—Surcharge Service: Each administration will continue to offer a surcharge service as at present. (In this connection it was mentioned that the rate from Kuwait might shortly be increased.) Road Transport: The Director-General P. &amp; T. Iraq will seek tenders for a road service between the post offices at Basrah and Kuwait. The basis of the tenders will be provision of a regular daily service (7 days) in each direction and the usual arrangements in regard to safeguarding of mails in transit and liability for losses will be required. an h\k The Director-General P. &amp; T. Iraq proposed that use of the once weekly sea service should be ceased upon the introduction of a road service (this will mean that transit surface mails will also be conveyed by road) and that payment to the contractor should be on a monthly basis calculated on the current average traffic. It was agreed that the Director-General P. &amp; T. Iraq should pay for the road service in both directions and recover dues in respect of despatches from Kuwait through the medium of the General Account with the United Kingdom (in sterling). The apportionment of charges as between the two administrations should be equal, but this might be varied in the event of marked variation in the overall weights of mail despatched. The Postal Superintendent at Bahrain will also obtain tenders for the service from contractors in Kuwait and the information thus obtained will be notified to the Director-General P. &amp; T. Iraq by the General Post Office, for purpose of comparison. 46639 2 N262 Review of Arrangements: On the proposal ot the Director-General P. &amp; T. Iraq it was agreed that there should be no specific provisions made for the period of life of the special arrangement, or for its review. Such adjustments as may be necessary from time to time will be agreed as required. Date for Commencement of the Arrangement: The arrangement will commence on a date to be notified by the Director-General P. &amp; T. Iraq to the General Post Office. This date will provide two months' notice and it may be in advance of the completion of the arrangements about road transport, although it would be preferable that despatches by road should commence from the outset. Notification of the Special Arrangement: Each administration will notify the International Bureau. The General Post Office will notify the Ruler of Kuwait through the usual channels. Agreed between H.E. Abdul Baqi Abdullah (D.G. P. &amp; T, Iraq) and Colonel E. W. Wood (G.P.O. London).

In this letter you enquired what measures Government intend to take with reference to this protection. 2. I am instructed by His Majesty's Government to reply to you as follows: — {a) Protection will be afforded you on the condition, which I have already explained to you verbally, that you give the oil concession about which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been negotiating to that company. (b) The protection from His Majesty's Government, as already explained to you verbally, will be external, i.e., against serious and unprovoked attacks which may be made on your territory from outside your frontier. This protection, as I explained to you verbally on my last visit, and with which you agreed, naturally refers to serious incursions, and not to small raids. In this connexion, therefore. His Majesty's Government naturally expect you to take all reasonable steps for your own defence and for maintaining order within your own frontier. (c) With regard to the methods with which His Majesty's Government propose to assist you. They propose to carry out this object through the Royal Air Force. (d) You will, of course, understand that, in order that in case of emergency the aircraft should be able to come to your assistance as soon as possible and be able to take action swiftly and effectively when they have arrived, it is necessary that the Royal Air Force should have certain facilities in your territory. These facilities should be as follows! Freedom to use wireless telegraphy when necessary, since, as you will realise, the essence of defence by aircraft is speedy communication. Some landing grounds will also be necessary as well as arrangements for storing petrol and other requirements necessary in order that the aircraft may take effective action Royal Air Force aircraft and officers will also require to visit Qatar from time to time whenever the Air Officer Commanding thinks suitable in order to inspect the Royal Air Force defensive arrangements, and in order to get information in collaboration with you which will be necessary for them in making their plans for your defence. APPENDIX B (Paragraphs 6 and 56) Letter, dated May 111935, from the Political Resident to Shaikh Abdullah agreeing that he should exercise jurisdiction over subjects of Kuwait, Bahrain and the Trucial Coast, recognising Hamad as his successor and undertaking to give him full support in any difficulties arising from the presence of the oil company With reference to your letter No. 7/54, dated the 18th April, 1935 (the 14th Muharram, 1354), which you gave me on my last visit, and our conversations on my present visit, I am authorised by His Majesty s Government to address you as follows: — 2. In your letter you agreed that disputes between British subjects, British- protected persons and the subjects ot non-Moslem foreign Powers should be settled by the nearest officer of the High British Government, i.e., the Political Agent, Bahrein, or his representative. 3. You also agreed to my suggestion that disputes between British subjects and the subjects of non -Moslem foreign Powers and your subjects should be dealt268 with by a joint court, on which you and the Political Agent, Bahrein, wih sit, or on which your representative and the representative of the Political Agent, Bahrein, will sit. The place and the sitting of this court will be at Doha. 4. His Majesty's Government agree to what you explained to me verbally, i.e., that the subjects of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast should come under your jurisdiction, but that all other British-protected persons should come under the joint court. 5. In your letter you requested that your son Hamad should be recognised by His Majesty's Government as your successor. His Majesty's Government agree to this request, provided that Hamad now agrees to accept on his accession the Treaty of 1916. 6. In your letter you further asked that His Majesty's Government should accord yourself and Hamad, when the latter succeeded you, full support. You explained to me verbally that what you meant by this was full support in internal matter. His Majesty's Government are unable to accord you the measure of support you ask for, since this would involve an undesirable degree of interference in your administration. His Majesty's Government, however, are prepared to support you and your successors in any difficulties arising from the presence of the oil company. In other matters which concern you. the Government will not interfere. 7. It is understood, of course, that the above arrangements are subject to your granting the oil concession, about which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been negotiating, to that company.

In the circumstances I regret that you were not consulted about the building in question earlier and should be grateful for an lling in4 assurance that you have no objection to its construction. The building, which has not yet been completed, is intended to house a light at|0E which will be of great benefit to all kinds of ships voyaging in the vicinity of the 'P n l; island. There will be no persons living in the building when it is completed, but the any L light will be tended from time to time by the Nearchus or such other vessel as may to t be used for the maintenance of lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf. Levies,! 1 ® Letter, dated November 25, 1951, from the Ruler of Abu Dhabi to the Political 1 Resident I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's letter I fW itlt No. 1084/12, dated the 13th November, 1951 corresponding to the 13th Safar, II 1371 and to thank Your Excellency for this information. 2.

Your esteemed letter dated the 16th Shawal (28th September) was received on the 1st Zilkadah (13th October, 1912) and what you had stated was duly understood. As regards our Island of Tamb and (the fact that) you have requested me for permission for the establishment of a lighthouse thereon for the guidance of steamers. All right; but we hope from you that there will be no inter!erence with the Island beyond that.

In regard to our representative there we shall, God willing, not neglect about him as stated by you. And I will esteem it an honour to carry on what you require of us. APPENDIX G (Paragraph 76) Letter, dated December 9, 1936, from the Ruler of Sharjah to the Political Resident accepting responsibility for the safety of any oil company surveying party in his territory Reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 88 dated the 4th Sha'ban 1355. 2. I beg to inform Your Honour that I agree that I will be responsible for the safety of any surveying party of the Company in my territory and if they are attacked—which God forbid—I will take all possible action against the culprits and will pay compensation, on account of any harm caused to the personnel and for loss of property, in accordance with the Muhammadan Law observed in my country. Note. —Similar undertakings were given by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman and Ras al Khaimah. APPENDIX H (Paragraph 96) Statement of the Boundary claimed by the Saudi Arabian Government with Qatar and Abu Dhabi—dated October 14 1949 The Saudi Arabian Government have already expressed their views about the basis on which the frontiers between Saudi Arabia and the Imarates and the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf should be demarcated. The basic principle should be to take account of what territory is under the authority of His Majesty King Abdul Azis and what is under the authority of the Amirs and Sheikhs. 2. After detailed study of the tribal areas and of the facts, the Saudi Arabian Government consider that the frontiers between Saudi Arabia and Qatar are as follows: — ia) The frontier between Qatar and the Saudi Arabian Kingdom starts from a point at the coast of Dohat Salwa at 24° 56' North (point A). [h) From point A the line runs due East until it intersects longitude 51° 00' East (point B). 6 (c) The frontier runs in a straight line from point B until it reaches the sea coast at latitude 24° 48' North (point C), leaving Amirah to the Saudi Arabian Kingdom. This defines the frontier between Oatar and the Saudi Arabian Kingdom. c a -' a ^ auc ^ A ra ^i? 1 n ^ overnm 6nt consider that the frontier line between d ^ 1 ^ f , h ' D J habl , ? tarts from a point on the Persian Gulf between andar Al Mm a and Bandar Al Maghira two kilometres east of Bandar Al Mirfa211 (point A). From this point the boundary runs in a straight line to the South-West until it reaches latitude 23° 56' North (point B). From there it runs due East till it intersects longitude 54 00' East (point C) and from that intersection it runs in a straight line as far as latitude 24° 25' North and longitude 55° 36' East (point D). 4. The Saudi Arabian Government consider that these frontiers correspond with reality, having regard to their authority and the authority of Abu Dhabi and relying on the fact that the lands thereby allocated to Saudi Arabia are inhabited by tribes owing allegiance to the Saudi Arabian Kingdom: the Bani Hajir, the Awamir, the A1 Murrah, the Dawasir and other tribes. 5. As regards what lies to the South and East of the position 24° 25' North and longitude 55° 36' East, this is under the authority of Sheikhdoms which are not in treaty relations with the British Government. Therefore, the frontier between the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and these Sheikhdoms will be agreed between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Sheikhdoms in question. 6. As soon as they have received detailed information in the matter, the Saudi Arabian Government will submit a statement about the demarcation of the Southern frontier of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom.

(ii) Letter, dated Decemhev 20 1951, frowi the Sultan of Muscat to the Political Resident We have received your Excellency s letter of to-day's date regarding extra- territorial jurisdiction and we confirm that you have understood correctly Your Excellency may inform His Majesty the King accordingly.(£*] 291 APPENDIX D (Paragraph 87) Correspondence about Facilities for the Royal Navy at Khor Quwai—1935 and 1947 (i) Letter, dated March 27 1935, from the Sultan of Muscat to the Political Agent, Muscat 1 have received your letter dated the 26th March, 1935, and understood its contents, in addition to the conversation which we had with regard to the Jazirat-al Ghanam, a dependency of my country Khasab. You have been directed by the Honourable the Political Resident to ask my permission to use the whole of the island for the purpose of constructing small buildings for His Majesty's navy to be used as a club for the officers, a canteen and a store for keeping provisions. Also a mooring for the oil barge at Khor Quwai. I have also received the plan of the island and the Khor, and noted the places required by you for the construction of small buildings, the mooring, the beach for bathing, and the place for the sports. I have thought over this matter, and, in view of the friendly relations which exist between me and the British Government, I inform you in reply that with great pleasure I accord you permission to use the northern part of the island for the places mentioned in the plan. As there are goats in the island, I do not agree that the whole of the island should be used by you. It is said that the goats are wild, but they are not, and belong to some of my subjects, who often visit the island and see the goats. Besides the places mentioned in the plan, I allow the British navy to go for a stroll in the rest of the island if they wish to do so, but they should not erect buildings in any place other than those mentioned in the plan. It should also be understood that the British navy should not catch any of the goats in the island, as they are not wild ones and belong to my subjects. They should not prevent my subjects from visiting the island and using places other than those specified in the plan for building, &amp;c. 1 regret that I cannot accord permission for the use of the whole island, as my subjects cannot do without it. They would not be able to use it if the British navy use the whole island, and I am unwilling that any misunderstanding should arise between them, the storekeeper and the naval men living in the island. Moreover, my subjects should be at liberty to land and go about in the island except to places which I have allowed you to use.O During our conversation you pointed out that no flagstaff will be erected in the island, that only small buildings will be constructed and that the places mentioned in the plan will be used. I would like to know at what time the work starts so that I may be able to inform the Vali who represents me in these parts. I would also like to know how many persons are going to live in the island, and whether they are in possession of any arms or not. I request you to convey the contents of my letter to the Honourable the Political Resident and confirm what I have explained in it. (ii) Letter, dated March 20 1947, from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Sultan of Muscat With reference to Your Highness' letter No. c/8, dated the 3rd December, 1946, I am directed to inform Your Highness that there are no longer any naval personnel stationed on the island of Jazirat al Ghanum, and that except for the addition of a wireless and cable station with ancillary buildings and stores, the position is now as it was before the war. I have asked the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, to supply me with a plan showing the position of the new buildings (!) I .e., building sites, bathing and games places.292 and will forward it to Your Highness as soon as it is received. Jn the meantime, I am to ask Your Highness for permission for the Royal JNavy (a) to retain and maintain these new buildings in addition to those constructed before the war, , i ^ ^ u (b) to maintain a caretaker and coolies necessary to look after the buildings, (c) to make periodic visits for inspection and repairs. I am to assure Your Highness— (a) that no naval personnel will be stationed on the island, (b) no new additional buildings will be erected, (c) the wireless station will not be brought into use without Your Highness 1 prior consent having been obtained.

APPENDIX G (Paragraph 97) Proclamations issued by the Sultan regarding arms and ammunition— 1898 and 1912 (i) Proclamation by the Sultan of Muscai forbidding the export of arms and ammunition to India and Persia, dated January 13 1898 Be it known to such of our subjects as see this that, whereas the British and Persian Governments have represented to us that they are desirous of preventing introduction of arms and ammunition into India and Persia, and that there is reason to think that many are exported from Muscat and taken to those two above-named countries, we have resolved to join them and to assist them as far as it lies in our power in suppressing this trade in arms and ammunition between Muscat and India and Persia. We therefore warn (our subjects) that all the arms and ammunition sent to those two countries will be confiscated and those engaged in this trade will be punished, as the introduction of arms and ammunition into India and Persia is prohibited by the Governments of those two countries and therefore illegal. In future our Muscat flag will be no protection to vessels carrying the said arms and ammunition from our dominions to Indig and Persia. (ii) Proclamation by the Sultan of Muscat granting British and Persian vessels of war the right to search Muscat vessels for arms, dated January 13 1898 Be it known to all who see it that we have given permission to British and Persian vessels of war to search vessels carrying their and our flags in our territorial waters, and to confiscate all arms and ammunition (weapons of war) in them, if those arms and ammunition are intended for Indian and Persian ports, and if they are the property of British, Persian or Muscat subjects. We have also given permission to those vessels of war to search Muscat vessels in Indian and Persian waters suspected to contain arms and ammunition for Indian and Persian ports, and to confiscate the said arms and ammunition. (iii) Notification issued by the Sultan of Muscat establishing a bonded warehouse for arms and ammunition, dated June 4 1912 • u large quantities oi ai ms and ammunition are at present stored without proper control in private buildings, distributed in this our town of Maskat, and thus exposed to the risk of attack, robbery or fire, we, impressed by the serious menace to the safety of our capital arising therefrom, have resolved to remedy this state of affairs, m accordance with the needs of the times and the requirements of our municipal administration, by the construction and establish ment of a special customs house magazine or arms warehouse for the storage of1 297 arms and ammunition under safe precautions. It is proposed to introduce this warehouse arrangement from on or about 1st September next. It will be conducted on the following general lines: — Firstly.—On or after 1st September all arms and ammunition or parts thereof imported into my territories will be taken direct from the steamer to the special arms warehouse, to the control of which a special Superintendent will be appointed by us. Secondly.—Similarly all arms-dealers in my territories will be required to deposit stocks remaining in their hands on 1st September in the said warehouse. Any trader offending against this regulation will, in addition to other penalties, render all future consignments of arms and ammunition arriving in his name liable to confiscation, unless and until he complies with this regulation in full. Thirdly—No arms will be allowed to issue from the warehouse until duty has been fully paid thereon to the Customs Superintendent in the usual way. Fourthly.—The withdrawal of arms from the warehouse will be regulated by the issue of special licenses prepared by the Superintendent and countersigned by myself. Fifthly.—Such licenses will not be granted to traders but only to approved individual purchasers or their duly authorised agents on the production of satisfactory proof that the number, quantity and destination of arms, ammunition, etc., to be withdrawn from the warehouse are free from justifiable objection. Sixthly.—All arms issuing from the warehouse will be marked with a special warehouse mark and serial number. Seventhly.—Special rules will be drawn up providing for and regulating the issue to approved traders of sample stock for exhibition in their shops. Eighthly.—Rules providing for the collection of arms warehouse charges, on stocks therein deposited, will be drawn up on the analogy of the present Customs House Regulations for the levy of such fees on general merchandise. Ninthly.—Special rules will be drawn up governing the transfer between traders' stocks deposited in the arms warehouse. Tenthly.—Special relaxations will be arranged for in favour of flint-locks, muzzle-loading gun powder and caps in reasonable quantities. Lastly.—Detailed rules embodying the above principles are under preparation and will be published in due course for the further information of all concerned.
