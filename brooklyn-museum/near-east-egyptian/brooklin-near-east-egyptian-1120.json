The earliest <i>shabties</i> are inscribed with either the deceased&rsquo;s name (see nos. 1 and 2) or a simple form of Chapter 6 of the <i>Book of the Dead</i>. The rarity and high quality of the early <i>shabties</i> suggest that they were costly items produced for privileged persons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater, Chapter 6 began appearing more frequently on funerary figurines. The text mentions that they do agricultural tasks for the dead person: irrigating the fields, cultivating crops, and clearing away sand that blew in from the nearby desert.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs substitutes for the deceased, these figurines were sometimes given their own sarcophagi (see no. 6). To emphasize the agricultural function of the figurines, hoes and grain baskets were added to them (no. 8).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWood (nos. 9&ndash;11), stone (nos. 12&ndash;14, 16), faience (no. 17), metal, and other materials were used beginning in Dynasty 18. By the end of the New Kingdom, statuettes for a single person were often mold-made by the hundreds and even thousands. Faience became the medium of choice, first in blue and later in light green or light blue (nos. 17, 20, 21).<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2010-05-05", "date_added": "2011-01-18 16:44:57", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "11.686", "object_id": 3076}, {"accession_number": "16.190", "object_id": 3159}, {"accession_number": "05.401", "object_id": 3226}, {"accession_number": "34.997", "object_id": 3334}, {"accession_number": "48.26.1", "object_id": 3492}, {"accession_number": "48.26.2", "object_id": 3493}, {"accession_number": "48.26.3", "object_id": 3494}, {"accession_number": "52.72", "object_id": 3573}, {"accession_number": "55.174", "object_id": 3614}, {"accession_number": "60.97.1", "object_id": 3688}, {"accession_number": "60.99", "object_id": 3689}, {"accession_number": "37.128E", "object_id": 3974}, {"accession_number": "37.145E", "object_id": 3976}, {"accession_number": "37.148E", "object_id": 3977}, {"accession_number": "37.163E", "object_id": 3979}, {"accession_number": "86.226.34", "object_id": 4251}, {"accession_number": "1991.107", "object_id": 4273}, {"accession_number": "39.3", "object_id": 49164}, {"accession_number": "39.6", "object_id": 49166}, {"accession_number": "37.129E", "object_id": 116843}, {"accession_number": "37.146E", "object_id": 116858}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.16.377_wwgA-3.jpg", "id": 74565, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.16.377_wwgA-3.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.16.377_wwgA-3.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 45, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 90, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 180, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 361, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 722, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.16.377_wwgA-3.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "West Wing gallery A-3 installation", "caption": " <em>Shabty of Nofer</em>, ca. 1352-1279 B.C.E.
