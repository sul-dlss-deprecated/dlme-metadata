(X** 3#) r\ fhouranel. quostion of the , With regard to the^acquisition ofGwadur, the accounts varied, but the following was considered by the Rev.G*P.Hadter to be the most probable:- 'The most probable account of the manner in which Gwadur fell into the hands of fleyyed Sultan was given ae by an old Helooch Chief at Uuscat, whoso relatives hav-^ been in the service of the luavun for several generations, an i whose narrative of facts 1 found to correspond generally with the native chron icles of those tir.oa. Ho states that Seyyed Sultan, the fifth but the bravest son of Ii^aum Ahmed, the first of the reigning Muscat dynasty, having rebelled against his father, repaired to the Khan of Khelat and sought his aid in dothroning him. The Khan, wishing to have a friendly power possessed of a naval force to protect hi a coast, and foreseeing thatthat miltiin woul'i evontualXy ^ucce^d to the Huacat aoveroi(nty t so far volunteered hie adaialuncr* as to £ive hi; . f in pen ty f the town and fort of GRvadur, the only attached condition beinf that he should always defend the place against the ener.iea of Khelat. Considering tho unimportance of Owadur at tho time, and the Khan 1 * inability, from want of ship*, to guard it from attack, there is no improbability in this story, and several of the facts on which it is founded are corroborated by contemporary Arabian hist orians* 1 find, on referring to the Arabic chronicles of the time that the dispute between Imaun Ahmed, the sovereign of iiusc&amp;t, and his two eonSt Sultan and Self, commenced about the year 176C, and continued, with occasional intervals of reconciliation, until the death of their father in 1774. If, as is averred, Gwadur was made over to Seyye sultan at that period, the place has been a dependency of Muscat for about a century. It is also admitted that the rulers ox Muscat hiiVo been in undisturbed possession of Gwadur from nearly the midfile Of the last century, fully a century ago, and it is, therefore, obvious that their title, whether valid or otherwise originally, derive* a prescriptive right fro« mere lapse of tU=e.« 'Baluchistan'</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000145_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B118</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000145</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B118</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Mem: Conclusion of the Declaration with France as to Muscat in 1862 and the acquisition of Gwadar by Muscat.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1899/1899</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-05T10:23:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>This file consists of a single memorandum.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at folio 86 and terminates at folio 90, as it is part of a larger volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
