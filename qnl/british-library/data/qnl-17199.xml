The extent of these disturbances was conveyed to the Resident in a report by Captain George Brown Walker, Commander of the HC Cruizer
                           Benares.It is explained that Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, is willing for the Resident to mediate a settlement to restore tranquillity to the Gulf; the Imam has instructed Shaikh Tanoon [Ṭaḥnūn bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān] to follow the Resident's instructions respecting the mediation. The letter also outlines the Imam's view that the disturbances originated with Sooltan been Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr] and Rasheed been Ahmed. The Resident claims that this view is backed up by letters he has received from Arab chieftains and Captain Walker's aforementioned report.The letter further explains that it may be justifiable for subjects to transfer their allegiance from one sovereign to another under the practices of 'Arab Government', even if it would not be acceptable in a European context.It is noted in the letter that the Resident is awaiting the arrival of Mohomed been Ally [Muḥammad bin ‘Alī], so that he may carry out the Government's orders concerning the Bene Boo Ali [Banī Bū ‘Alī] tribe.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x00003e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
