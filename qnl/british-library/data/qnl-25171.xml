Also discussed is a proposal to give the bank financial assistance up to a maximum of £343,000 to cover losses sustained whilst their branches were unable to open for business as a result of civil disturbances. The Foreign Office inquired if the India Office would contribute half of this sum (£171,500). The safety of the British colony at Hamandan is an additional topic of discussion.The correspondence also discusses the Imperial Bank of Persia's concession and the anticipated infringement by the Russian Government, as well as the impact of the February Revolution 1917.The volume consists of two parts IOR/L/PS/10/224/1 and IOR/L/PS/10/224/2. Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, year the subject file was opened, subject heading, and list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran, Bushire Manager</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran, Manager</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Coinage production</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Banks</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000075#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
