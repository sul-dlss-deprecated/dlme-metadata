The continuation of the Aden boundary northwards is represented by a ‘Violet Line’ running north-east from Wadi Bana to latitude 20º in the Ruba’-al-Khali Desert and then by the ‘Blue Line’ of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29 July 1913 which continues into the north-eastern province of Hufuf (also known as Al-Hasa) in Najd [Saudi Arabia]. The map bears the printing statements: ‘G.S.G.S. [Geographical Section, General Staff] No. 2709’, and ‘War Office, Feby. 1914’. The map is a copy of Annex C to the Aden Boundary Settlement of 1905, which also contains the Aden Frontier Delimitation Protocols of 1903, 1904 and 1905, agreed between the joint British and Ottoman boundary commissioners.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100055644130.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
