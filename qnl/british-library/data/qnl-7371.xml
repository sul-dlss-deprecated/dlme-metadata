(July—August, 1928.) 59106/28 (No. 75). No. 1. COLONIAL OFFICE TO SIR GILBERT CLAYTON, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., C.B. [Answered by No. 2.] Downing Street, 19th July, 1928. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th of July* reporting on the progress and the results of your recent mission to Jeddah to negotiate a settlement of outstanding questions with His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud. The circumstances which led to the suspension of your conversations with King Ibn Sa'ud last May as a result of a deadlock on the question of the advanced desert posts in 'Iraq have been considered by His Majesty's Government in consultation with the Government of 'Iraq. It has been decided that the interrupted conversations should be resumed as soon as possible and that the conduct of the resumed negotiations should be entrusted to you, a duty which it is understood that you are prepared to undertake. In communicating to you the instructions contained in this letter, in the sense of which the concurrence of the 'Iraq Government and, where necessary, that of the Government of Trans-Jordan has been obtained, I am to explain that these are intended for your general guidance only and that there is no desire on the part of His Majesty's Government to interfere with your discretion in regard to the precise form or manner in which the various decisions reached should be communicated to Ibn Sa'ud. 2. In regard to the major question at issue, namely, that of the advanced posts in 'Iraq, you should inform King Ibn Sa'ud that His Majesty's Government regret that they are unable to make any * See page 3 of Middle East, No. 25. (14549 C) 125 1/29 B24 concession of principle. Subject to their Treaty engagements, which in the considered opinion of His Majesty's Government have in no way been infringed in the present case, the 'Iraq Government have every right to make what arrangements they please for the administration of their tribes and of their desert areas and His Majesty's Government cannot accept any interference with this right, the maintenance of which they regard as essentially a British interest. You should, however, explain to King Ibn Sa'ud that the actual system of administration to be adopted for this purpose has not yet been determined and it is proposed immediately to consider a reorganisation of the present system. The present intention of the 'Iraq Government is to retain three advanced posts only, apart from such posts as may be required for the protection of the trans-desert route and of a pipe-line, if and when constructed, and apart also from posts so remote from the frontier as clearly to be of no interest to King Ibn Sa'ud. Into these two categories would fall the existing posts at Rutba, Ain Wiza, and Muhaiwir, to none of which King Ibn Sa'ud is understood to take exception. The advanced posts which the 'Iraq Government at present intend to retain will provisionally be located at Salman, Busaiyah, and Shabicha, although the 'Iraq Government must reserve liberty to vary these locations if this is considered desirable hereafter. In the case of Shabicha it is not proposed at present, unless the situation on the frontier becomes threatening, to proceed with the erection of permanent structures. 3. You should inform King Ibn Sa'ud that you are authorised to communicate to him the assurance of His Majesty's Government and of the 'Iraq Government that these advanced posts are not designed for offensive purposes and that Nejdi tribes will suffer no interference with customary rights of watering, grazing, and peaceful movement at any of the points where advanced posts may be established. Those Governments realize that friendly co-operation with His Majesty is a necessary condition of the satisfactory administration of the tribal areas and the maintenance of peace in the desert, and to this end they would suggest for his serious consideration the appointment of frontier representatives on each side of the border who could confer together in the case of raids or other frontier incidents and could apprise each other, as also their own Governments, of any happening likely to disturb the tribes and thus the peace of the border. Furthermore, in order that His Majesty may be in a position to satisfy himself that any advanced posts maintained by the 'Iraq Government are not used for offensive purposes and that there is no interference with any Nejdi tribes in their legitimate pursuits, the 'Iraq Govern ment would welcome periodical visits to the posts by his frontier representative. You should make it clear to His Majesty that the5 'Iraq frontier representative would not necessarily be a British official. In regard to the question of the type of garrison con templated for the advanced posts I am to enclose for your information and guidance copies of a telegram addressed to the High Commissioner for 'Iraq on the 16th of July, and of his reply * 4. In the earlier paragraphs of your report you have recorded in some detail the views expressed by King Ibn Sa'ud as to the meaning and intention of the disputed words ' in the vicinity of the border ' used in Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol and you very rightly pointed out that, although His Majesty's interpretation of the words in question may find some support in the Arabic text of the Article, that interpretation is one which had never been con templated and cannot be accepted by His Majesty's Government. Clearly the phrase stands in need of more precise definition and, in order to remove the present ambiguity and thus eliminate the possibility of further dispute by the adoption of an agreed definition, His Majesty's Government would suggest that the phrase should be accepted as meaning within 25 miles of the frontier. In proposing this definition to King Ibn Sa'ud you should make it clear that His Majesty's Government regard as excluded from the scope of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol any posts which may be required in connection with the protection of the trans-desert route and pipe-line (if con structed), to which as an essentially British interest His Majesty is understood to have no objection in principle. 5. As regards the question raised in paragraph 12 of your report, namely, that of the intention and effect of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, I am to authorise you to inform King Ibn Sa'ud in writing that His Majesty's Government regard this Article as applying to British as well as 'Iraqi forces. You may also assure His Majesty that His Majesty's Government intend to observe the stipulations of this Article and that British forces will not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders. In the case, however, of an organised attack on a township or post—as opposed to a mere tribal raid—or in the event of a series of raids with which His Majesty proves himself unable or unwilling to deal, His Majesty's Government must reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they think fit. When communicating this assurance to King Ibn Sa'ud you should, as suggested in paragraph 20 of your report, take the opportunity of inviting King Ibn Sa'ud to explain the mean ing which he attaches to the term ' forces ' in Article 6 when applied to the forces of Nejd. His Majesty's Government agree that it is advisable, in order to preclude the possibility either of genuine misunderstanding or of equivocation on his part in the future that an acceptable definition of what must be held to constitute the ' forces ' of Nejd should be obtained from King Ibn Sa'ud. * 59106/28 [No. 90]; not printed.6 (3. In your report you refer to the displeasure evinced by King Ibn Sa'ud on learning that British aeroplanes and armoured cars had crossed the Nejd frontier after he himself had expressed his willingness to meet a representative of His Majesty's Government, and (in paragraph 26) you suggest that when communicating to him the explanations of the incidents in question furnished by the High Commissioner for 'Iraq in his telegrams of the 23rd* and 26th of Mayf (copies of which are enclosed for convenience of reference), you should accompany them with a suitably worded expression of regret. As you are aware, one of the incidents of which King Ibn Sa'ud com plained related to an operation undertaken with the object, which was successfully achieved, of preventing a raid by 'Iraqi tribesmen into Nejd territory. In regard to this incident, while His Majesty's Government recognise that it constituted a technical breach of the Bahra Agreement, they feel that the prevention of a raid at so critical 4 a moment was of such advantage to both parties as to justify the exceptional action taken. The other incidents related to the crossing of the common frontier by aeroplanes and armoured cars engaged upon reconnaissance duties. As you are now aware, on those occasions no bombs were dropped in Nejd territory. In view of the circumstances existing at the time and of the justifiable uncertainty then felt as to the ability of King Ibn Sa'ud to re-establish effective control over his tribes, His Majesty's Government consider that any relaxation of precautions at that time would have been unjustified and inconsistent with their responsibility for the defence of 'Iraq. In these circumstances they consider that the local authorities were justified in continuing reconnaissance across the Nejd frontier until they were satisfied that the meeting between King Ibn Sa'ud and yourself would in fact take place and that His Majesty would be successful in preventing the serious raid which was then threatened and re-establishing some measure of effective control over his recalcitrant tribes. His Majesty's Government therefore consider it desirable that the explanation conveyed to King Ibn Sa'ud in regard to these incidents should not take the form of an admission that the action in question was unjustified. Such an admission would, in the circum stances set out above, in their opinion be uncalled for, nor can it be overlooked in this connection that an explanation so worded as to admit of being regarded as an admission of error on the part of His Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government would be likely to encourage a demand on the part of King Ibn Sa'ud for the payment of damages. If therefore King Ibn Sa'ud raises the question again on your return to the Hejaz you should acquaint him with the true facts as reported in Sir H. Dobbs's telegrams of the 23rd* and 26th of May,f and should explain to him that in the absence of the definite assurance from His Majesty for which His Majesty's Government had asked in regard to the prevention of further raids and in view * Printed on Page 81 of Middle East No. 25. t 59129/28 [No. 8]; not printed.of the disquieting and conflicting reports which reached 'Iraq at the time of the conference at Buraidah, the continuance of active reconnaissance as a precautionary measure was considered to be necessary. You may add that His Majesty's Government would not, in view of the terms of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, have sanctioned these measures but for the critical conditions which then obtained on the frontier. As already indicated in paragraph 5 of this letter, His Majesty's Government regard this Article as applying to British as well as to 'Iraqi forces, and intend to observe its stipula tions. The reconnaissances were in fact suspended immediately reassuring information as to the situation was received, and His Majesty's Government much regret that the action taken should have proved a cause of embarrassment to King Ibn Sa'ud. 7. From paragraph 27 of your report it is observed that King Ibn Sa'ud proposes to prefer a claim to compensation in respect of losses suffered by Nejdi tribesmen in the course of the operations carried out by the Royal Air Force. His Majesty's Government cannot regard any such claim as admissible, and you should do your utmost to resist a claim of this nature if presented and to obtain full com pensation for the 'Iraq Government both on account of the attack upon the post at Busaiyah and on account of subsequent raids upon 'Iraqi tribes. If, however, you are satisfied that there is no possibility of securing both compensation from King Ibn Sa'ud for the Busaiyah incident and at the same time the withdrawal of his claim in respect of bombing operations in Nejd territory and that insistence on this would have the effect of endangering a settlement, you are authorised in the last resort to acquiesce in an arrangement whereby the claim of the 'Iraq Government for compensation in respect of the attack on Busaiyah would be set off against King Ibn Sa'ud's claim for bombing operations and these two claims would then be allowed to cancel out, while the remaining and financially more important 'Iraq claims in respect of subsequent raids would be referred to the special tribunal contemplated in Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement. 8. In paragraphs 31 to 36 of your report you have recorded the results of your discussions with King Ibn Sa'ud and of subsequent conferences at Jerusalem on questions arising out of past raids across the Nejd—Trans-Jordan frontier. You .are authorised to inform King Ibn Sa'ud, as is proposed in paragraph 34 of your report, that, although His Majesty's Government cannot admit a condition such as that proposed in Clause 5 of the draft terms of reference to the arbitrator who is to adjudicate upon past raids, they are prepared to give him an assurance to the effect that the arbitrator will be fully informed of his view that all past claims which were not officially registered at the time of the raid or soon after should be excluded from the purview of the arbitrator. You are also authorised to adopt the procedure proposed in your report (paragraph 34) for obtaining the agreement which will be a necessary preliminary to8 the appointment of the arbitrator. You have been informed of the views of His Highness the Amir of Trans-Jordan in regard to the draft terms of reference to the arbitrator, and it is understood that you will bear them in mind when framing the notes which you propose to address to the Hejaz and Trans-Jordan Governments, setting out for their acceptance the conditions on which the arbitrator is to be appointed. As regards the proposal at the end of paragraph 36 of your report, you may assure King Ibn Sa'ud that the Trans- Jordan Government are taking prompt and adequate measures to deal with the situation created by recent raids carried out by Trans-Jordan tribes who are subject to him. The High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan has been requested to furnish you with full par ticulars of the action already taken by the Trans-Jordan Government in the matter. He has represented that it is important that King Ibn Sa'ud should take similar action in regard to the attack made by the Ruwala tribe on the Beni Sakhr tribe in February last. When communicating to His Majesty the proposed assurance on behalf of the Trans-Jordan Government you will no doubt obtain a similar undertaking from him and, if possible, a statement of the action already taken by him to deal with the situation created by the raid of February last. 9. Subject to an acceptable arrangement in the matter of the advanced posts. His Majesty's Government trust that you will do your utmost to secure a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations for a Bon Voisinage Agreement and an Extradition Agreement between Traq and Nejd which were in progress when your conversa tions with King Ibn Sa'ud were temporarily suspended. In the interval the Traq Government will doubtless have had an oppor tunity of considering the report of their own representative at Jeddah on the questions raised in those negotiations and will now be in a position, where necessity exists, to put forward revised proposals. You are authorised to inform King Ibn Sa'ud that His Majesty's Government view with favour the proposal for the conclusion of similar agreements between Trans-Jordan and Nejd and are prepared to advise the Trans-Jordan Government to enter into such agree ments subject to the settlement in due course of satisfactory drafts. 10. In paragraphs 41 and 42 of your report you refer to the desire of King Ibn Sa'ud to appoint accredited Nejdi representatives in Baghdad and Jerusalem. This proposal has been communicated to the Traq Government who have expressed their willingness, subject, of course, to an acceptable arrangement in the matter of the posts, to receive accredited representatives of King Ibn Sa'ud and to accord to His Majesty the formal recognition of his regime in the Hejaz which the reception of his representative would entail. They would moreover desire to reciprocate the arrangement by appointing an accredited 'Iraqi representative in the Hejaz. It is9 not clear whether for the purposes of representation abroad King Ibn Sa'ud regards the Hejaz and Nejd as separate kingdoms or as one State, and consequently whether he would wish to appoint to 'Iraq and to receive from King Faisal two accredited representa tives or one. If the question of representation is raised in your conversations you should ascertain the wishes of King Ibn Sa'ud in this matter and also in which of his towns he would wish the accredited representative or representatives of 'Iraq to reside, bearing in mind that the 'Iraq Government desire to be represented at Riyadh. The similar proposal for the appointment of an accredited Nejdi representative at Jerusalem, whose credentials would cover both Palestine and Trans-Jordan has been communicated to the Govern ments of those territories who have expressed their willingness to accept such a representative and the Trans-Jordan Government, who have not hitherto done so, have agreed to accord to His Majesty formal recognition of his regime in the Hejaz provided that King Ibn Sa'ud for his part will recognise the independent government of Trans-Jordan under the rule of His Highness the Amir, which formally will come into being on the ratification of the Agreement* between His Britannic Majesty and His Highness the Amir, signed at Jerusalem on the 20th of February, 1928. 11. A separate letter will be addressed to you in regard to the arrangements for your return to the Hejaz and in regard to the composition of your mission. I am, etc., J. E. SHUCKBURGH. (C14549) * Cmd. 3069. C10 59176/28 (No. 2). No. 2. SIR GILBERT CLAYTON, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., C.B., TO COLONIAL OFFICE. 3rd September, 1928. Sir, In continuation of my report, dated the 10th July, 1928,* and with reference to your letter No. 59106/28, dated the 19th July, 1928,t I have the honour to submit a further report on my recent Mission to the King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. 2. I left London on the 20th July, 1928, with Mr. G. Antonius, C.B.E., and arrived at Port Sudan on the 29th July, having been joined at Port Said by the 'Iraq Government Delegation, consisting of Taufiq Bey Suwaidi, Minister of Education, and Major Bahauddin Nuri of the 'Iraq Army, accompanied by Ahmad Effendi Sarraf as Secretary. Mr. E. C. Harvey, of the Palestine Civil Service, also joined the Mission at Port Said as Confidential Clerk and Stenographer. 3. Leaving Port Sudan on the 29th July in H.M.S. Clematis (Commander F. Ratsey, R.N.), the Mission, together with the 'Iraq Delegation, arrived on the following day at Jeddah, where the usual official reception was accorded by the local authorities. 4. Ibn Sa'ud arrived in Jeddah from Taif, travelling by way of Mecca, on the 1st August, on which day the Mission and the 'Iraq Delegation were received separately in formal audience. At this audience, I handed to Ibn Sa'ud, with due ceremony, a personal letter from His Majesty the King, which he received with marked gratification and an expression of deep respect and regard. It was then arranged to re-open conversations on the following morning. 5. Accordingly, the first meeting was held at 8.15 a.m. on Thursday the 2nd August. Three meetings were held in quick succession ; but on the following Saturday a sharp attack of fever incapacitated me and kept me in bed for four days. On the fifth day, namely, the 8th August, I was able to attend the fourth and last formal meeting with the King. A full record of the proceedings at those meetings and of an interview which Mr. Antonius had with the King during my illness will be found in Annexure I.J Concurrently with these meetings, a series of conferences was held by Mr. Antonius in committee with the King's advisers, of which an account is attached in Annexure II.§ The members of the 'Iraq Delegation were granted one audience by the King and held conferences with his advisers. I was kept fully informed by Taufiq Bey Suwaidi of the trend of these discussions but I have no written report from him. * Printed at page 3 of Middle East No. 25. f No. 1. t Page 18. § Page 32. X 1.0.R.11 6. On the eve of the opening of formal negotiations, Mr. Antonius had a long conversation with the King's advisers, from which it was evident that Ibn Sa'ud had not receded from his attitude in regard to the interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol and the cog nate question of the advanced posts. I decided, therefore, that a decision must be reached on these two cardinal points before the 'Iraq Delegation entered into the discussions. I also came to the conclusion, bearing in mind that direct methods appealed to Ibn Sa'ud, that further discussion and negotiation would serve no useful purpose, and that the proper course was to lay the whole situation before him and to seek a decision of principle on the major point at issue. 7. I therefore informed Ibn Sa'ud, in the course of our first two meetings, of the decisions which His Majesty's Government had reached in regard to the interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol and the question of the posts, emphasising particularly the close attention which the matter had received in the highest quarters, and the full consideration which had been given to his views and arguments which I had conveyed faithfully and in full to His Majesty's Government. 8. I then explained fully the policy of the 'Iraq Government, and the assurance which they were prepared to give, in regard to the advanced posts, and dealt in general terms with the various other questions which I was empowered to discuss and negotiate, pointing out that His Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government, though unable to give way on the main principle involved, weie prepared to go to great lengths to meet the Hejaz and Najd Govern ment in various other questions to which Ibn Sa'ud had always expressed himself as attaching great importance. 9. I concluded by urging the King to consider the situation as a whole, and to reflect deeply before deciding to maintain an attitude with which His Majesty's Government could never agree, and which would not only preclude a favourable settlement of such questions as extradition, Bon Voisinage, surrender of offending tribesmen and recognition of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Najd by 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan, but might even endanger his relations with the British Empire. 10. Ibn Sa'ud replied to this recapitulation of the main features of the situation by a very calm and friendly, but quite unequivocal,, statement to the effect that he had given to the whole question careful and mature reflection and was unable to reconsider his attitude. He was convinced that his interpretation of Article 3 was based on the spirit of the conversations at Uqair, in spite of anything Sir Percy Cox might now say, and he repeated that he would never have signed the Protocol or ratified the Muhammara (CI 4549)12 Convention if he had entertained any doubts on the matter. He deeply regretted to find that His Majesty's Government were now denying the principles on which, in his conviction, the Uqair Protocol had been based. 11. In any case, on the question of the advanced posts, he was now pledged to his people, who would never be content with mere assurances in a matter which they held to be one of life and death to them and in which he shared their views to the full. He was still inspired by unalterable feelings of friendship towards Great Britain and a determination to respect existing agreements ; and he was convinced that a policy of co-operation with His Majesty's Govern ment was in the best interests of his country ; but in this particular question he was powerless to subscribe to the decision which His Majesty's Government had seen fit to take. 12. I am convinced that Ibn Sa'ud was sincere in this expression of his views. From whatever angle I approached the question, he would put forward arguments which were clear, firm, and unequi vocal, and strictly consistent with his general attitude as he had defined it at the very outset of our negotiations. On one occasion, he confirmed his statements by one of the most solemn oaths which it is possible for a Moslem to take. I did not consider further argument either advisable or useful at the moment, so I begged the King to reflect once more before giving me his final decision and to accord me another interview on the following day. 13. At our third meeting I made a further effort to induce the King to modify his attitude in regard to the major point at issue, in order to make it possible at least to discuss the other questions with which, hitherto, I had only dealt in general terms. He remained quite unmoved, however, by any arguments or inducements, and I realised that further attempts to shake him would not only be undignified, but might result in introducing an element of irritation and petty dispute into discussions which had been conducted, hitherto, on a calm and entirely friendly plane. 14. I, therefore, informed the King that, to my deep regret, I saw no other course open to me than to terminate our conversations and to return to England. I added that I should report our failure to reach agreement to His Majesty's Government, who would con firm their decision officially through the proper channel. In the meantime, and until the decision of His Majesty's Government reached him in final form, I considered that the terms* of our sus pension of conversations, agreed upon on the 24th of May last, should be held to bind all parties. Ibn Sa'ud signified his agreement to this arrangement, and I deem it vital that it be strictly observed by the 'Iraq Government and by His Majesty's Forces in 'Iraq. * Printed at pages 66-68 of Middle East No. 25.13 15. A sharp attack of fever incapacitated me for the next four days, during which Taufiq Bey Suwaidi had an interview with the King and discussions with his advisers. He was unable, however, to bring about any change in Ibn Sa'ud's attitude and I decided to fix the date of our departure for Thursday, the 9th August, requesting the presence at Jeddah of H.M.S. Clematis on that date. 16. During my indisposition the King paid me a personal visit for the purpose of asking after my health, and two days later Mr. Antonius had an interview with him in order to convey my thanks for his kindness and courtesy. During this visit Mr. Antonius had the opportunity of conversation on the questions under discussion and I also had another interview on the 8th August, the day before our departure. 17. On both these occasions the King, while maintaining his attitude unchanged, gave clear evidence of his sincere desire to avoid any break of his relations with His Majesty's Government, and gave us the very definite impression that he meant to do his utmost to keep his tribesmen under control and to maintain peace on the frontier. I am of opinion that, while he has been somewhat shaken by the, to him, unexpected attitude of His Majesty's Government in the matter of the Uqair Protocol and by their decision in respect of the advanced posts, his long-standing feelings of friendship towards Great Britain remain substantially unchanged, and that he will do his utmost to maintain friendly relations and observe the provisions of existing agreements. 18. He appears convinced that his obligations towards his people in Najd render it impossible for him to give way, and it is probable that he hopes, by holding out firmly, to make it clear that he has supported them, thus strengthening his influence to an extent which will enable him to keep them in hand and prevent any serious outbreak. 19. If this is a correct appreciation, there is justifiable hope that the situation may resolve itself in the course of time, provided no untoward incidents on the frontier inflame it afresh. 20. I recommend, therefore, that the policy to be adopted be one of scrupulous observance of existing agreements and that, above all, no violation of the Najd frontier be permitted, unless a situation of such gravity should arise as to render abnormal measures unavoidable and entirely justifiable. There will almost certainly be unrest, and possibly a recrudescence of raiding across the frontier in the coming autumn and winter ; but the line between raiding and deliberate hostile attack should be kept clearly defined. Constant vigilance and a carefully thought out defensive organisation will be essential, but I submit that the measures taken should be such as cannot14 be construed as violating the provisions of existing agreements ; otherwise they will inevitably provoke the very danger which they are designed to meet, and may produce a situation which will commit the 'Iraq Government to indefinite embarrassment and expense. 21. lo summarise the questions which I was instructed by the terms of your letter* under reference to discuss with Ibn Sa'ud :— (a) The major issues of the interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol and of the advanced posts have been dealt with above. (&amp;) Ihe proposed Extradition and Bon Voisinage Agreements were not discussed in detail with the Hejaz and Najd Government, either by my Mission or by the 'Iraq Delegation, as our instructions laid down clearly that their negotiation and conclusion were conditional upon an acceptable settlement in regard to the question of the posts. I was not reluctant to drop these agreements for the present as, in view of the distrust and suspicion of the 'Iraq Government, which exists in the minds of the King's advisers and, indeed, of Ibn Sa'ud himself, I feel that they would serve no useful purpose at this stage, and would probably only be used as a means of supporting future complaints against the 'Iraq Govern ment of violation of treaty engagements. They are better reserved until such time as an atmosphere of greater friendliness and mutual confidence may prevail. (c) For the same reason the questions of recognition of the Hejaz and Najd Government by 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan, and of the exchange of representatives, were not carried beyond a general intimation to Ibn Sa'ud that they were susceptible of solutions favourable to him if a satisfactory settlement could be arrived at in regard to the posts. It was obviously undesirable to make for no return concessions which may be of use in the future. {d) Ibn Sa'ud did not again allude to his vehement protest against the violation of the Najd frontier in late April last, at a time when friendly conversations had been agreed upon by all parties, though his advisers raised the question at one of their meetings with Mr. Antonius, who gave them a full explanation of the views of His Majesty's Government {see Annexure II).f I did not, therefore, deem it either necessary or expedient to raise the question with the King. * No. 1. t Page 32.15 {e) I did not consider that any good purpose would be served, in the circumstances, by entering into what could only have been an acrimonious and unprofitable discussion on the subject of compensation. I therefore contented myself with informing the Hejaz and Najd Government that the 'Iraq Government must reserve their right to claim compensation for the destruction of life and property at Busaiyah, and would also, in due course, submit a claim (under the provisions of the Bahra Agreement) in respect of lives lost and property looted in the course of the raids subsequent to the attack on that post. (/) It was also quite obvious that the time had not come in which it was possible to put forward the proposal for the appointment of Frontier Representatives with any prospect of securing its acceptance. An arrangement of this nature will require to be evolved gradually and is contingent upon a return to normal conditions on the frontier. {g) The question of raids on the Najd—Trans-Jordan border was discussed by Mr. Antonius, on my behalf, with the King's advisers, who were fully informed of the measures taken by the Trans-Jordan Government for the punishment of the perpetrators and the restoration of loot. {See Annexure II*.) The Hej az and Naj d Government were also asked to furnish, on their side, similar information to the Trans-Jordan Government, which they promised to do on receipt of detailed information which they were expecting to receive in the immediate future. [h) With regard to Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, I informed the King at our first meeting of the interpretation placed upon that Article by His Majesty's Government. The matter was subsequently raised by the King's advisers in committee with Mr. Antonius, who informed them that His Majesty's Government, while fully prepared to give a formal assurance to the effect that Article 6 would be held to apply to Imperial forces in 'Iraq, were of opinion that it was also desirable that some clear definition of the term ' forces ' as applying to Najd should be simul taneously agreed upon. The King's advisers did not question the fairness of this proposal, but no further reference to this matter was made either by the King or by them. * Page 32.16 (i) The question relating to the proposed arbitration on past raids between Najd and Trans-Jordan was exhaustively- discussed, first in committee between Mr. Antonius and the King's advisers, and subsequently with the King him self at my fourth and last meeting with him. Ibn Sa'ud admitted openly that his insistence on the retention of Clause 5 in the proposed terms of arbitration was dictated by his fear lest the large and (as he thinks) unjustified claims submitted by the Trans-Jordan Govern ment to the Jericho Tribunal might mislead the arbitrator into an unfair verdict. I pointed out to him that there was every reasonable guarantee that that would not be the case, and I parted from him on the understanding that he would await the receipt of a formal proposal from His Majesty's Government. I attach the draft of a Note {see Annexure IIP), which I suggest should be addressed in identical terms to the Najd and Trans- Jordan Governments, in which I have embodied all the conditions agreed upon by both Governments and inserted an assurance which, while it safeguards the right of the Trans-Jordan Government to a fair hearing, might over come Ibn Sa'ud's objections, in that it ensures that his views on unregistered or belated claims will be fully brought to the notice of the arbitrator. 22. I seized the opportunity to discuss with Ibn Sa'ud the question of means of communication for official correspondence. The King stated that he realised that the delays which were occasioned were due in part to the absence of quick means of communication in Najd and in part to the frequency of his movements between the Hejaz and Najd. With a view to remedying this disability as far as possible, he had recently elaborated an organisation for the speedy transmission by motor car of messages from Jeddah to Riad. He wished, therefore, to request that in future all messages and com munications from the mandated territories be sent to him through Jeddah, even during his periods of residence in Najd. He pointed out that, during his absences in Najd, his Foreign Affairs advisers and staff remained at Mecca or Jeddah ; and he had taken the necessary measures to enable them to forward all communications to him by the quickest possible route. 23. During the course of my visit I took a suitable occasion to present to the King an astronomical telescope and a sporting rifle, on behalf of His Majesty's Government. He was evidently much pleased and interested in these presents, and asked me to convey his warm thanks to His Majesty's Government. * Page 36.17 24. At 10.30 a.m. on the 9th August, the Mission paid an official visit of farewell to the King. The interview was merely for the purpose of taking my leave. Ibn Sa'ud was most friendly and cordial, and once more assured me of his sincere desire for the main tenance of good relations and close co-operation with His Majesty's Government. 25. At the close of the interview Ibn Sa'ud handed me a personal letter for delivery to His Majesty the King. 26. The Mission embarked, with the usual ceremony, in H.M.S. Clematis at 11.30 a.m. on the 9th August and arrived at Port Sudan on the following day, sailing for England in the Bibby s.s. Cheshire on the 12th August and reaching London on the 21st August, 1928. 27. The 'Iraq Delegation and Mr. E. C. Harvey left Jeddah on the 10th August by Khedivial Mail Steamer Taif lor Suez. I cannot close this report without recording my thanks to Taufiq Bey Suwaidi for his assistance and cordial co-operation. It is unfortunate that the 'Iraq Delegation were unable, in the circumstances, to achieve any definite results, but I feel that their mission was not entirely fruitless, and may pave the way to a greater measure of co-operation and sympathy between the two Governments in the future. 28. At my last formal meeting with him, the King made a state ment concerning Mr. H. F. Stonehewer-Bird, His Britannic Majesty's Agent and Consul at Jeddah, to which I venture to draw your attention [see Annexure I,* proceedings of Fourth Meeting). The tribute paid to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird, coming as it does from a sovereign who is not lavish in his expressions of praise, seems to me to be one on which Mr. Stonehewer-Bird deserves to be warmly congratulated. I have, etc., GILBERT CLAYTON. (CI 4549) * Page 29. D18 ANNEXURE I. RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS. First Meeting. 0 ^ rSt mee ti n g was held at 8.15 a.m. on Thursday, the 2nd August, at the King s house and was attended by the King with his three advisers (Shaikhs Hafez Wahba, Yusuf Yasin Fuad Hamza) and by Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I opened the conversation by informing the King that I had taken the opportunity of the suspension of our discussions to proceed to London and report to His Majesty's Government. On my arrival m London I had prepared an interim report explaining the situation fully and had submitted it to His Majesty's Government. This report had been carefully considered by the Government, who had then brought it before a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet, presided over by the Prime Minister, for examination and discussion. I had been called before the Sub-Committee personally, had given full \ erbal explanations and had been closely questioned by the responsible ministers. I was informing His Majesty of this in order to assure him that his views had been placed faithfully before His Majesty's Government and had received careful consideration in the highest quarters. Hence, the decision which His Majesty's Government had arrived at was based on all available information and was the result of mature deliberation. 3. I then suggested that it would perhaps be well for me to state briefly to His Majesty the main points of the decision which had been arrived at, in order that he might be able to consider the broader issues as a whole. We could proceed later to discussion of minor points and explanations of detail. I reminded His Majesty that the main point at issue had been the differences of interpretation of the terms of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol, in which was bound up the question of the advanced posts which had been set up by the 'Iraq Government and to which His Majesty objected. I regretted that I was unable to give him an answer which he would consider favourable on this point and, as 1 had envisaged in my previous conversations with him, His Majesty's Government were unable to accept his interpretation. They realised that the wording, both in English and Arabic, was not very precise, but neither they nor the 'Iraq Government had ever contemplated any such interpretation as that which His Majesty had placed upon it. They would not have accepted such an interpretation at the time and they could not do so now. The 'Iraq Government,19 however, were now considering the whole question of administration and of the desert areas with a view to evolving an organisation which would be suitable to the prevailing conditions and acceptable to the people concerned. I was also able to give assurances to His Majesty which would, I hoped, convince him that no menace was intended either against his Government or his tribesmen. I sug gested, however, that these matters should form the subject of later conversations. 4. I then passed to the question of the crossing of his frontiers by aeroplanes and armoured cars and the infringement of his sovereign rights which he maintained was involved by this action on the part of His Majesty's forces. In this connection, I said that I was able to assure His Majesty that His Majesty's Government intended to observe Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement and recognised that His Majesty's forces in 'Iraq were covered by its provisions. I pointed out, however, that should a grave situation arise as a result of a serious attack on a township or continuous raiding on 'Iraq tribes which His Majesty proved himself unable or unwilling to prevent or punish, then His Majesty's Government must reserve full liberty of action even at the expense of a technical breach of agreements. 5. With regard to the question of Extradition and Bon Voisinage Agreements between 'Iraq and Najd, and the handing over of tribes men who might flee from one country to the other to avoid punish ment, which had been very fully explored in discussion between His Majesty's advisers and Mr. Cornwallis, I emphasised that any final agreement in these matters must depend on a favourable solution of the main question of the posts. At the same time, in principle, His Majesty's Government were entirely in favour of the conclusion of satisfactory agreements on these questions. The 'Iraq Government, who were also well-disposed and ready to meet His Majesty, had now despatched Taufiq Bey Suwaidi, one of their Ministers of State, with full instructions and the necessary authority to conclude agreements should they be successfully negotiated. I pointed out that, if these agreements could be successfully negotiated and duly signed by accredited representatives. His Majesty would thereby secure recognition of his sovereignty by the 'Iraq Government. His Majesty's Government were also in favour of similar agreements being concluded between the Government of the Hejaz and Najd and the Trans-Jordan Government, who were also favourable in principle, provided suitable terms could be agreed upon, and that His Majesty was prepared to recognise the status of Trans-Jordan as recently defined by treaty with His Majesty's Government. In conclusion. His Majesty's Government had agreed in principle to the exchange of representatives between the Hejaz and Najd Government and 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan respectively, subject to agreement on the major point at issue and to arrangements acceptable to both parties being made. (CI 4549) d220 6. I explained to His Majesty that the whole question should be viewed as one because everything really depended on a satisfactory solution of the main question of the posts, without which it would be useless to proceed to any discussion of the other matters. I had endeavoured to put quite briefly before him the main points, and I hoped that he would take his own time in considering them and would give me the honour of another interview at his convenience. 7. During the course of my interview I took occasion to tell His Majesty that I was permitted to give him a piece of information which had not yet been made public and which 1 must ask him to keep confidential for the present. It was that Sir Henry Dobbs was leaving 'Iraq shortly at the expiration of his period of office and that His Majesty's Government had decided to appoint me to succeed him. His Majesty's Government felt that it was due to His Majesty to give him early information of this decision, and I hoped that in view of the frankness and cordiality which he had always shown towards me, he would feel confident that his interests and those of his country would always be regarded by me with sympathy and a measure of understanding. I took my leave at 10 a.m. Second Meeting. The second meeting was held at 3.30 p.m. on Thursday, the 2nd August, in the King's house and was attended by the King with his three advisers, and by Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I asked the King whether he had any observations to make on the statement I had made at the first meeting ; on his replying in the negative I proceeded to explain the practical aspects of the ques tion of the posts as envisaged by His Majesty's Government. I informed him in the first place that His Majesty's Government, while insisting on the retention of the posts as a matter of principle, were anxious that there should remain no misconception in His Majesty's mind as to the character and the objects of the desert posts. I said that His Majesty's Government had authorised me to give him an explicit assurance that the posts were not intended, either at present or in the future, as a threat to Najd, or in any way to interfere with the lawful movements of tribes who were subject to His Majesty. I added that I had been authorised to give him that assurance in writing. I went on to inform His Majesty that the present intention of the 'Iraq Government was to confine themselves to the retention of the existing posts at Busaiyah and Salman and that, while reserving to themselves full liberty, in case of hostile action on the part of21 Najd, to abstain from proceeding with the construction of a per manent post at Shabicha. I also stated that His Majesty's Govern ment realised that the wording of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair was not sufficiently precise, both in the English and the Arabic texts, to preclude possible misunderstandings, and that they were of opinion that it was in the interests of all parties concerned that a more precise definition of its scope be laid down. The obvious and most satisfactory method of arriving at some such definition was that both sides should agree to express the phrase ' in the vicinity of the frontier ' in terms of a certain fixed mileage. His Majesty's Government proposed that the distance be fixed at a maximum of twenty-five miles on either side of the frontier, which would result in the establishment of an unfortified belt of a total breadth of fifty miles. I added that it was the considered opinion of His Majesty's Government that the establishment of such a belt would not only correspond to the intentions underlying the stipulations of Article 3, but would also provide a means of ensuring peace in so far as watering rights in the frontier zone were concerned. 3. I asked His Majesty to give careful consideration to my state ment of the aims and policy of His Majesty's Government in this matter. Although it might appear to him that his representations on the subject had not secured their desired end, I would assure him that they had been fully reported to and carefully considered by His' Majesty's Government, and that it was only after due examination of his representations and of his version of the proceedings at Uqair that His Majesty's Government had come to the final conclusion which I had just announced to him. Moreover, reference had been made recently to Sir Percy Cox, and I had that very day received a telegram to the effect that Sir Percy Cox's account of the genesis of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair was such as to confirm His Majesty's Government in their belief that their interpretation of Article 3 was the only one which was in accord with the spirit of the Agreement. 4. The King's reply was very calm but very firm. He began by expressing his regret at the statement which I had made to him, on the ground that the conclusions of His Majesty's Government were contrary to the pledge which had been given to him at Uqair. He declared that this was the first occasion on which he felt that he could legitimately say that the confidence which he had always placed in His Majesty's Government had been disappointed. His denuncia tion of what he evidently regarded as a breach of trust was unequiv ocal, but it was couched in such calm and measured terms that ] saw no occasion for protesting, and I contented myself with an equally explicit refutation. 5. His Majesty went on to say that, even if there had been no pledge at Uqair, the policy adopted by the 'Iraq Government by building posts in the open desert was an unnecessary and an unwise22 one. In his opinion, that was not the way, indeed it was a most dangerous way, of ensuring a quick and reliable intelligence system. The proper way would be for expert officers like Captain Glubb to move about among the tribes and find out what was happening by maintaining an alert watch. If more was needed in the way of secret intelligence, there were plenty of people in both countries who would make excellent spies at a moderate salary. Further, he wished to point out that my report of what Sir Percy Cox had said filled him with surprise. He remembered perfectly clearly that Sir Percy Cox had told him over and over again at Uqair that Article 3 would preclude him (Ibn Sa'ud) from building a post at places like Lina ; and the location of Lina was such as to make it scarcely accurate to describe it as being in the immediate vicinity of the frontier. He also remembered that in his discussions with Sn Percy Cox he had often asked him to define the nature of the neutral zone between 'Iraq and Najd, and it was clear from Sir Percy Cox s definition that the neutral zone was intended as an area which would remain in all respects common to both sides while the desert area on either side of the frontier would remain common to both sides only so far as concerned demilitarisation and freedom of tribal movements. 6. I replied to His Majesty by assuring him once again that all his arguments and representations had been very carefully con sidered, and that I regretted to inform him that His Majesty's Government, much as they desired to go as far as possible towards meeting his point, were unable to give way on a question which they regarded as a matter of vital principle. I could not admit that there had been any breach of trust and I stated again that His Majesty's Ciovernment in arriving at their conclusion were confident that they \\ere carrying out the spirit as well as the letter of their engagements. 1 begged His Majesty to avoid coming to a hasty conclusion on this subject. 7. 1 he King answered with characteristic bluntness that the matter was no longer one which called for reconsideration. He had given to this question all his time and his thoughts for the last eight months and more, and he was sufficiently aware of his rights and of t e icalities of the situation to express his conclusions without lesitation. He added with a restrained vehemence that there were only two courses open to him. One was to tell his people that he a ailed and that there was no hope left of his securing what he considered to be their rights. The other was for him to clear out of his country bag and baggage and take refuge across the seas. He used an emphatic oath to assert that it was absolutely impossible for himself or his people to accept the conclusions that His Majesty's oyernment had arrived at. He felt that His Majesty's Government nad placed themselves in the position of a party to this quarrel and that they were issuing a verdict in a dispute in which they23 themselves were involved. His experience had taught him that it was almost impossible for one of the parties to a quarrel to sit in judgment over the merits of the dispute and issue a verdict which was absolutely impartial. 8. I said to His Majesty that I received his statements with regret, but that I had one request to make to him and that was that he should permit me to refuse to accept this as his final reply. I begged him to consider what the effect of renewed disturbances on the 'Iraq frontier would mean. Such disturbances would have, if need be, to be met with adequate defensive measures and there was no telling what the consequences of that might be. They would probably be deplorable from the point of view of both sides, but one thing was certain, namely, that if the dispute were to lead to war, and it became known that Najd had resorted to war in order to prevent 'Iraq from building police posts at 60 or 80 miles within their frontier, then the public opinion of the whole world would be behind 'Iraq. The right of a Government to decide what was right and proper within its own undisputed territory was a matter of principle on which there could not be two opinions. I wanted to beg His Majesty therefore to postpone his final reply and I asked him to consider the matter overnight and to let me have his reply only after mature consideration. 9. It was then agreed that the next interview would take place at 8 a.m. on the following day, and the meeting closed at 5 p.m. Third Meeting. The third meeting was held at 8 a.m on Friday, the 3rd August, at the King's house, and was attended by the King, with his three advisers, and by Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I asked the King whether he was in a position to express a final opinion on my statements of the previous day or whether there were any points on which he wanted further information. His Majesty replied saying that the question at issue, namely, that of the posts was perfectly clear, and that the reply which he had given me at the previous meeting represented his considered opinion. He asked me to believe that it was not merely a tactical device, but that it was a frank statement of his views. 3. I replied that I had one question to ask of His Majesty. He had repeatedly and at great length spoken of the feeling which the erection of the posts had given rise to among his people, and of his interpretation of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair. But there was one point on which I wished to hear his views in detail and that was ; What exactly were the concrete objections of his people to the24 existence of the posts ? As far as I had gathered from His Majesty's statements, their objections amounted to a fear that the posts might be used as a menace against their country and an obstacle to their lawful movements. I had informed His Majesty on the previous day that I was prepared on behalf of His Majesty's Government to give him an assurance in writing to the effect that the posts were ■not intended and would not be used, in normal times, as^a base for offensive action or for hampering the movements of tribes. And yet his Majesty was telling me that still his people could not consent to the retention of the posts. It seemed clear that they had other objections than those of fear, and I would request His Majesty to inform me what those were. 4. In his reply the King embarked on a long and detailed narra- tive. It was to the effect that the trouble had its origin in the old hostility of the Hashemites to him and his people. When King Faisal was set up on the throne of 'Iraq and the Amir Abdullah made ruler of Tians-Jordan, the people of Najd felt that these measures were designed to encircle their country with a chain of hostile Hashe- mite rulers, and they saddled the British Government with the designs and nefarious activities of the two brothers and their father. There were also, amongst other things, the notorious activities of the Press in the Hejaz and the mandated territories, which kept instilling the poison of fear and distrust into the minds of the people of Najd by giving currency to disturbing news about such things as chaining-in the people of Najd with a network of posts and railways. He had always done his utmost to allay their anxieties and keep them below boiling-point and had often exposed himself to the suspicion of being himself in connivance with the British and their agents. While his people were in that frame of mind and he was using all his energies to pacify them and keep them in order, news was suddenly received of the construction of a chain of posts in the open desert ; and alongside with the construction of those posts there was a recrudescence of rumours appearing in the Press and of threats expressed in official speeches. Then it was that the worst suspicions of his people were confirmed and their animosity aroused to a pitch hich made it impossible for him while the posts remained in existence to continue with any success his work of pacification. 5. I said to His Majesty that his statement' did not in reality answer my question. It was an explanation of the reasons which had aroused the suspicions and fears of his people rather than an explanation of the exact nature of their misapprehension. With regard to his statement on the rumours appearing in the Press I pointed out to him that there were in all countries certain evils which seemed inseparable from the existence of a free Press, and that it was hardly possible or politic for a Government to attempt at every turn to contradict every false rumour that appeared in print. I also told him that it was not only the Press in mandated25 territories that gave currency to such rumours by way of a service to the Hashemite rulers, but that there were also journalists in all countries who reported the same kind of nonsense as had appeared in certain 'Iraq newspapers about the desire of the British Govern ment to construct a railway from Basra across Jauf to Aqaba. Amongst those journalists, I might instance Mr. Philby, who was renowned not only for his friendly feelings to the kingdom of the Hejaz and Najd, but also for his unfriendliness towards the Hashe mite family. And Mr. Philby, as His Majesty was aware, had himself spread that ridiculous rumour in the very territory of His Majesty. 6. ihe King said that he was aware of that and then proceeded to speak of what he called the unwillingness of his people to place their faith any longer in written assurances. He said that they had often turned to him in the last few months and spoken angrily about the policy of treaties and agreements. They had asked him to explain how it was that the agreements made at Bahra were constantly infringed by the rulers of 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan, how the Treaty of Jeddah, which had recognised their absolute independence, had been violated from time to time by aeroplanes and armoured cars, how the stipulation that the adjoining territories would never be used as a base for unlawful activities against their interests was frequently infringed, not only by individuals but also by official agents of the 'Iraq Government. ' I find it impossible,' added the King, ' to go to my people at the present critical juncture and say to them that as a result of my negotiations with you I have obtained yet another written assurance.' His people had certain very limited standards of judgment and reasoning, and to their elementary minds such a step would only appear in the light of a piece of trickery on his part. He concluded his statement with an emphatic protesta tion of his desire to retain the friendship of Great Britain, not out of love for Great Britain necessarily, but because he realised that it was imperatively in his interests to retain it. 7. I said to His Majesty that I failed to see, so long as he main tained that attitude, that any useful purpose could be served by a continuation of our conversation. I asked him to consider the question not only in its immediate aspects, but also with a view to his interests in the future. He had spoken at great length of the feeling of his people in the matter of the posts and said that the building of those posts had only served to confirm their suspicion and distrust. He was now asking that the posts be removed with a view to allaying the suspicions of his people. In my opinion, how ever, the removal of those posts in the present circumstances would still further confirm his people in their suspicions and distrust ; and it seemed to me far wiser to explain to them the true nature and object of those posts and to leave it to time to show that their suspicions and misapprehensions were really unfounded. I would26 therefore suggest to His Majesty that he should consider that sug gestion and examine it quietly and I thereupon took my leave without fixing an appointment for our next interview. The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m. On the 7th August, while Sir Gilbert Clayton was still in bed with er, Mr. Antoniushad an interview with the King, of which a record is submitted in the following minute. Minute by Mr. Antonius. My interview with the King took place at 4.45 p.m. on Tuesday, k 10 cv at ^ ie ^ n ^' s house. His Majesty was attended by Shaikh Hafez Wahba, Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and Shaikh Fuad Hamza. 2. I opened the conversation by informing His Majestv that I had been delegated by Sir Gilbert Clayton to thank him for his kindness m sending his physicians to attend him, and more particularlv for his gracious visit to his bed of sickness. I had also been instructed to acquaint His Majesty with the fact that Sir Gilbert Clayton pro- posed, subject to His Majesty's concurrence, to fix the 9th August as the date of the departure of the Mission ; and to ask for a formal meeting with His Majesty on the afternoon of the 8th August. r-u Km g ) re P lied th at he had been much distressed at Sir tiilbert Clayton s illness, but that he was relieved to hear that he was progressing favourably. He would willingly hold a meeting on the afternoon of the following day as suggested, and he offered m view of Sir Gilbert Clayton's state of health to come to the Mission house for the meeting. With regard to the departure of the Mission he could only regret that our stay this time was going to be so short' 4. I asked His Majesty whether he had made plans for his own departure and, if so, whether the date we had chosen fitted with his own plans. 5. The King replied that his departure was contingent upon ours He intended to leave Jeddah on the day following our departure and proceed to Mecca. He would then return to Taif to meet the depiitations from Najd, who had come to enquire about the outcome of the negotiations. His Majesty added that he could not tell how long he would remain at Taif, owing to the difficult task which confronted him. The Badu, he said, are a curious people. They are ignorant and obstinate, and when an idea becomes ingrained in27 their minds it is impossible to dislodge it. The King concluded his statement with an expression of deep regret at the failure of our negotiations. 6. I said to His Majesty that the failure of the negotiations was a matter for regret to every one concerned, and I expressed the hope that he would not attribute our disagreement over the interpretation of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair to any lack of good will on the part of His Majesty's Government or of the 'Iraq Government. The fundamental question at issue was one of principle. The inter pretation which His Majesty had put forward, if it were admitted, would entail the surrender of a principle of far-reaching import. 7. Ihe King replied that he fully realised that, and added that at no time had it entered his mind that there was any lack of good will on the part of His Majesty's Government towards him. At the same time, he felt disappointed and puzzled. The conversations which he had had with Sir Percy Cox at Uqair had been exhaustive, and to his mind no doubt or misunderstanding as to their true meaning was possible. When trouble broke out in Najd, he had had no hesita tion in revealing to his subjects the contents of the hitherto undis closed Protocol of Uqair ; and it was precisely because of his belief in the justice of his interpretation that he had flourished Article 3 in their faces and asked them to leave matters to him. ' My people have confidence in me for one thing, if for no other,' added the King somewhat excitedly, ' they know that I am a man of my word, they know that 'Abdul-'Aziz has never made a promise in vain ; and I have made a solemn promise to them that Article 3 meant that the posts would be demolished. How can I face them now ? ' 8. I said to the King that I felt it would be presumptions of me to express an opinion on the best way open to him to deal with his own subjects ; but that, if he would allow me, I would ask him to tell me a little more of the reasons which caused the people of Najd to take such strong exception to the posts. We had been told that they objected to the posts, partly because they considered them as a menace against their security and partly on the grounds that they might be used to prevent or restrict their access to the water or their free movements in the pursuit of trade and grazing. Sir Gilbert Clayton had informed His Majesty that both the British and the 'Iraq Governments were prepared to give explicit assurances which would meet all those objections, and dispose of the extravagant rumours relating to the construction of a railway across Jauf. So much for the objections which had come to our knowledge. What I w T anted to ask His Majesty to tell me was whether there were any other objections of which we had no knowledge. If there were, it might well be that some means might be found of meeting them, too. I spoke at some length in this sense, in an endeavour to get the King to realise the insufficiency of his arguments in so far as they rested on a basis of fears and apprehensions.28 9. The King remained silent for a moment, and when he spoke made no answer to my question. He said that the tribesmen of Najd were, like all Badu, a simple and obstinate lot whose powers of comprehension were limited, and who were only capable of grasping straight issues. He then shook his head and said, as if in soliloquy : ' Would that I had never mentioned Article 3 to them !', and the silence which ensued was only broken by a sigh of commiseration uttered by Shaikh Hafez Wahba. 10. I then said to His Majesty that since he had asked me my opinion I would venture to say that, if there remained no alternative but to agree to differ, the obvious duty of every one concerned would be to ensure that that difference should remain as far as possible a disagreement on paper and that it should not lead to feelings of hostility and still less to acts of hostility. 11. The King replied with an emphatic disclaimer of any intention to countenance acts of hostility. His anxiety was caused by the fact that the feeling against the posts was not confined to the tribes men, but had spread among all classes of the population of Najd. He said that Faisal al-Dawish and his Mutair were really nothing. They might give trouble for a time, but sooner or later they would be muzzled. Unfortunately, there were others who counted for more than all the Mutair put together. ' There are people,' he added, ' who are of us and who are always with us ; and it was those very people who, when news reached Riad of the aeroplanes and bombs, came to me and said they had withdrawn their allegiance. When I go back to Najd to announce the result of our negotiations, there will not be a single man, woman or child on my side.' 12. I contented myself with an expression of hope that His Majesty might be completely successful in his task. I then said that Sir Gilbert Clayton had instructed me to bring and present the telescope and the sporting rifle of which he had spoken to His Majesty. 13. I thereupon went out to the terrace of the house with the King's advisers and gave Shaikh Yusuf Yasin a demonstration of how to mount and use the telescope. As soon as the instrument was mounted and set, the King came out and spent some time looking at distant objects through the telescope ; and he expressed his surprise and delight with its powers of magnification. I took my leave at 6 p.m. G A(£) 29 Fourth Meeting. The fourth meeting was held at 4.45 p.m. on Wednesday, the 8th August, at the King's house, and was attended by the King with two of his advisers, and by Mr. Antonius and myself. 2. I opened the conversation by expressing my thanks to the King for placing his physicians at my disposal and for his kind visit to me during my illness. After an exchange of amenities, which in the circumstances had to occupy some time, I proceeded to the discussion of official matters. 3. I said to the King that the object of my visit was to have an opportunity of reviewing the situation to which our conversations had brought us and to ensure that the terms on which I was taking my leave were clear to His Majesty and were receiving his assent. The terms were briefly as follows :—It had not been possible to arrive at a settlement of the dispute relating to the posts, in spite of the desire which was manifest on both sides to come to an amicable settlement. I was confident, and I had every reason to hope that His Majesty would concur, that that did not mean any interruption of the friendly relations which happily had so long existed between His Majesty's Government and the kingdom of the Hejaz and Najd. I was now proceeding direct to London to report to His Majesty's Government the result of our conversations and to ask them to send His Majesty a formal statement of their views as I had communicated them to him. Meanwhile, the conditions laid down in the Notes* exchanged on the 23rd and the 24th May last would be held by all parties to be still in force and to remain in force until the present negotiations were formally terminated by a communication from His Majesty's Government. 4. The King replied with an assurance to the effect that our difference of opinion on the question of the posts had not affected his own friendly dispositions towards Great Britain. He added that our failure to arrive at a settlement was placing him in a very difficult position, and would certainly furnish a fresh weapon to those of his people who accused him of placing too great a trust in treaties and agreements. He went on to say that, notwithstanding this failure, he was determined to continue his efforts towards pacification and to prevent as far as was in his power the outbreak of hostilities on the frontier. He concluded his statement with a declaration in somewhat vague terms from which it might be inferred that he did not despair of keeping the peace. 5. I replied with a statement that I felt confident that His Majesty would continue to do his utmost to preserve the peace, and I expressed the hope that his efforts would be crowned with success. I added * Printed at pages 66-68 of Middle East No. 25.30 that it was a matter of regret to me to think that there was scarcely any prospect of my paying another visit to His Majesty in the near future, but that on the other hand I looked forward to the time when on taking up my appointment in Baghdad, I should be in a position to co-operate with His Majesty as well as with the 'Iraq Government m the task of fostering peaceful and friendly relations between the two Arab States. I concluded with an expression of hope that His Majesty would continue, when I found myself in 'Iraq, to look upon me as a friend and honour me with his good will and confidence • and I would beg of him not to hesitate to communicate with me as often as he might desire so as to avoid the occurrence of misunder standings and ensure real and effective co-operation. anH l3 he h' 111 ! wit T \ a ® how of appreciation of my statement and he echoed the hope I had expressed for friendly and peaceful co-operation m the future. He added that, if it were not for the XTthefutee S ' he W0Uld haVe n0 anxiet y whatCTer 7 : 1 ^l' ' 1 broac hed the question of the proposed arbitration on S a T'' a) and Trans-Jordan. I said that I understood from Mr Antomus report* of his discussions with the King's r'l mS'i; ft. I(, lesty t was Stin msistin g on the retention of S Hk Mai 1 1 6 ^ mS t rb ' tration - 1 had Previously explained to His Majesty the reasons which made it difficult for His Maiestv's Government to accept such a condition, and I wished to ask him'to reconsider his decision on the understanding that his views on the Arbitrator W0Uld ^ fully brou ^ ht to the notice of the . 8 ' replied that his insistence on the retention of Clause 5 was dictated, not by obstinacy, but by his conviction that the claims which were sprung upon the Jericho Tribunal by the Trans-lordan Government were not such as to deserve being taken into con sideration; and that he was reluctant to bind himself to accept a verdict winch ran the risk of being affected by such extravagant c aims. He added that if arbitration on the conditions which he had put forward was not possible, then he would ask His Majesty's Government to take up the matter themselves, examine the claims and adjudicate upon them. He would sooner accept a verdict issued by His Majesty's Government after an impartial examination of the clamis than bind himself to accept the verdict of a paid Arbitrator who, coming fresh to the problem, might be misled by the plausibility of some of the claims put forward by Trans-Jordan. 9. I replied that I fully understood His Majesty's attitude in the matter and I realised that his principal concern was to ensure a j ust and fair adjudication. Ihe point had not escaped the attention * Annexure II, pages 32-35.31 of His Majesty's Government and they would bear it specially in mind in drafting the formal proposal of arbitration. I wished therefore to ask His Majesty to await the receipt of the formal proposal which would in due course be addressed in identical terms to His Majesty and to the Trans-Jordan Government. 10. The King signified his assent. As I was preparing to take my leave he said that there were two matters to which he wished specially to draw my attention. The first was that, on the preceding evening, Mr. Philby had reported to him that he had heard of the appointment of Sir Gilbert Clayton to the post of High Commissioner for Iraq, and that he (Mr. Philby) was sending a telegram on the subject to the newspaper of which he was correspondent ; but that he (Ibn Sa'ud) had instantly asked him to refrain from doing so. The King went on to say that Mr. Philby had had the information imparted to him in the course of conversation with the 'Iraq Delega tion, and that he (the King) was somewhat perturbed lest I might have heard of the leakage and imagined that it came from the King or from his advisers. ' Whenever we are told anything in con fidence,' added the King, ' we keep it secret, at the point of the sword if need be ; and the thought that you might suspect us of a breach of confidence is intolerable.' 11. The second related to his dealings with the British Agency at Jeddah. The King said that he wished to seize the opportunity of my presence at Jeddah to express his particular appreciation of the way in which Mr. Stonehewer-Bird discharged his duties. He stated with an emphasis which bore the stamp of sincerity that both his advisers and himself had been impressed with Mr. Stonehewer- Bird's fair-mindedness, his tact and his scrupulous thoroughness. He added that he looked upon it as evidence of the good will of His Majesty's Government towards him that they should have selected Mr. Stonehewer-Bird as their representative in the Hejaz. 12. I replied that I was delighted to hear this statement, more especially as I knew that His Majesty was a good judge of men; and that I would make a point of communicating his opinion to His Majesty's Government who would be gratified to hear it. I then took my leave and the meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.32 ANNEXURE II. MEMORANDUM ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE SUB COMMITTEE MEETINGS. Six meetings were held between the 31st July and the 8th August with the King's principal advisers (Shaikh Hafez Wahba, Shaikh \ usuf Y asin, and Shaikh Fuad Hamza) and myself, at which the following questions relating to Trans-Jordan were discussed {a) the measures taken by the Trans-Jordan Government to deal with recent raids ; (b) the raid committed by the Ruwala in February, 1928 ; (c) the proposed appointment of an arbitrator to adjudicate on claims in respect of past raids ; {d) the proposed appointment of a Najd representative for Palestine and Trans-Jordan ; {e) an article in ' Umm al-Qura.' 2. With regard to {a), the discussion consisted mainly of a detailed statement on my part, describing the measures taken by the Trans- Jordan Government to deal with the raids which had taken place in May last. I based my statement on the particulars contained in two letters, dated respectively the 4th and the 22nd July, from the British Resident, Amman, to the High Commissioner for Trans- Jordan, which were enclosed in Lord Plumer's despatch* of the 24th July to Sir Gilbert Clayton. I pointed out to the King's advisers that the measures taken by the Trans-Jordan Government compared very favourably, in point of promptness and thoroughness, with those taken by the Najd Government in connection with the Ruwala raid on the Bani Sakhr. And I expressed the hope that the measures taken by the Irans-Jordan Government were an adequate answer to the complaints lodged against them by the Najd Govern ment on the score of inaction. The King's advisers showed un feigned surprise at my recital of the measures taken in Trans-Jordan, of which they had hitherto had no knowledge, and they asked whether they might take a note of the particulars I had enumerated. I proceeded to dictate to Shaikh Fuad Hamza a summary of the information at my disposal. 3. With regard to {b), I began by asking the King's advisers for a statement of the measures taken by the Najd Government in respect of the Ruwala raid of February, 1928, on the Bani Sakhr. They * 59106/28 [No. 104]; not printed.(is) 33 replied that while they were not in possession of the latest information, they knew that the return of the loot which had begun at Jauf in accordance with the strict orders of the King had been impeded by the fact that sections of I rans-Jordan tribesmen who had been called to Jauf to receive their looted property suddenly committed a raid in the Wadi Sirhan on their way to Jauf. This had com plicated matters considerably, and had compelled the Amir of Hail to suspend the liquidation pending reference to the King. 4. I pressed the King's advisers to give me further particulars of this occurrence, with a statement of the names of the persons involved : but they declared that their information was still in complete. I thereupon informed them that the Bani Sakhr claim in respect of the raid led by Farhan ibn Mashur amounted to a bill for 162 persons killed, 4,162 camels and 8,590 sheep stolen, besides a quantity of tents, arms and clothing ; and that the latest informa tion at our disposal was that only some 200 camels had hitherto been returned. I found it necessary to speak with some insistence on this matter, pointing out to the King's advisers that the authorities of Najd, who were so fond of charging the Trans-Jordan Government with inaction or slackness in dealing with raids, had allowed six months to elapse without making good more than an insignificant fraction of the losses sustained by the tribes of Trans-Jordan. Where upon they reminded me that the King had given an undertaking to settle the matter as promptly as possible and gave me an assurance that they were confident he would carry out his undertaking, I then asked them formally on behalf of Sir Gilbert Clayton to bring my representations to the knowledge of His Majesty. 5. With regard to (c), two meetings were almost entirely devoted to the discussion of this question. The point of disagreement was, as on the previous occasion, the contents of Clause 5 in the proposed terms of arbitration. After some discussion, in the course of which I informed them of our proposal to address identical notes to the two Governments and of the reasons therefor, the King's advisers adjourned to refer the matter to His Majesty. At a subsequent meeting they informed me that the King was prepared to consent to the modification of Clause 5, on condition that the claims sub mitted by the Trans-Jordan Government to the Jericho Tribunal would be specifically excluded from the arbitration. This suggestion was obviously unacceptable, and I endeavoured to show the King's advisers why it could not in fairness be adopted. But, while admit ting the arguments, they declared that they were unable to drop the essential stipulation in Clause 5. It was clear that their instructions did not give them any latitude. I therefore concluded the discussion by informing them that I would report the results of our deliberations to Sir Gilbert Clayton who would then take the matter up with the King.34 6. With regard to {d), I informed the King's advisers that His Majesty's Government and the Amir of Trans-Jordan were prepared in principle to agree to the appointment of a consular representative in Jerusalem accredited to Palestine and Trans-Jordan, but that the appointment would naturally be governed by the established conditions of international usage, such as formal recognition. The King's advisers stated that that would follow as a matter of course. I seized the opportunity of questioning them about the objects which the Hejaz-Najd Government had in view in proposing the appointment of a representative in Jerusalem. They stated that for some time past their subjects had experienced difficulties with regard to customs dues on trade passing through Palestine and Trans-Jordan in transit from Syria to Najd or the Hejaz and vice versa ; and other difficulties of a similar nature connected with passports and transit formalities. They added that the King had in mind the possible conclusion of a Customs Agreement with Trans-Jordan, and that the appointment of an accredited repre sentative in Jerusalem was a prelude to the ultimate conclusion of such an Agreement. 7. With regard to (e), I should explain that, some time previously, the ' Umm al-Qura,' which is the official (and the only) newspaper in the Hejaz and Najd had published a report to the effect that the Trans-Jordan tribesmen who had set out to raid the Ruwala at Hazim in April last had been led by the Amir Shaker, the cousin of the Amir Abdullah. This report was a mischievous perversion of the truth. What had happened in point of fact was that, when news of the projected raid on the Ruwala reached the authorities in Trans-Jordan, the Amir Abdullah ordered his cousin to overtake the raiders and urge them to turn back ; this the Amir Shaker was successful in achieving, and the raid never took place. 8. A despatch from Jerusalem on the subject had been received by His Britannic Majesty's Agent and Consul in Jeddah, with a request that he should protest to the Hejaz-Najd Government about the report which had appeared in their official organ. This despatch was communicated to Sir Gilbert Clayton by Mr. Stonehewer-Bird, and it was agreed that the protest should take the form of a verbal observation and that I should communicate it formally to the King's advisers. I did so at my last meeting with them. As the occurrence in question had taken place before I had started on the Mission in April, I was able to speak to the King's advisers from personal knowledge. I said to them that Sir Gilbert Clayton did not wish to send up a formal protest in writing because he did not wish to attach undue importance to Press reports ; but that he thought it desirable at the same time that the King should be informed of the true facts of the case.35 9. In addition to the questions relating to Trans-Jordan, some considerable time was spent in the discussion of questions relating to 'Iraq which formed the subject of Sir Gilbert Clayton's negotia tions with the King. On the occasion of our first meeting, on Wednesday, the 1st August, the King's advisers asked me whether I was in a position to give them any information on the subject of the definition of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, and of the King's protest against the violation of the Najd frontier in the latter part of April. After reference to Sir Gilbert Clayton, I made a statement to the King's advisers on both those subjects, in the terms set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Sir Gilbert Clayton's instructions.* With regard to the first, the King's advisers admitted that the reciprocity for which I asked in the matter of defining the word ' forces ' seemed to them to be fair and acceptable, but that they were unable to pronounce definitely on the matter without reference to the King. With regard to the second, they said that they would convey the substance of my statement to His Majesty who would then raise the matter with Sir Gilbert Clayton. (As it happened neither of those two questions was ever referred to afterwards, either by the King or by his advisers.) 10. The question of compensation for losses formed also the subject of discussion at one of our meetings. I informed the King's advisers that, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, the attack on Busaiyah was to be regarded as distinct from the raids which followed it. One was an organised attack for the purpose of destruction ; the others were raids in the ordinary sense of the term. With regard to the first, the 'Iraq Government reserved their right to claim compensation for the lives lost and the property destroyed ; with regard to the second, the matter would be brought up in due course for liquidation before a special tribunal as provided in the Bahra Agreement. The King's advisers said that they would convey my statement to His Majesty. G. A. * Pages 5 and 6.36 ANNEXURE III. DRAFT NOTE ON THE ARBITRATION OF RAIDS BETWEEN NAJD AND TRANS-JORDAN. I have the honour to inform ^7 =—that, in consequence Y our Excellency ^ of the discussions which were recently held at Jeddah, it has been decided to proceed with the proposal of referring the outstanding claims on account of past raids between Najd and Trans-Jordan to arbitration. 2. I am authorised to inform Your Ma j^ st y on 0 f |-[j s Your Excellency Britannic Majesty's Government, that they are prepared forthwith to select and appoint a qualified British arbitrator, subject to the prior receipt of an assurance from the Government of the Hejaz and Najd and from the Government of Trans-Jordan to the effect that they will consider themselves bound by the final adjudication of the Arbitrator. 3. The conditions which will govern the appointment, remunera tion, powers, and duties of the Arbitrator are as follows :— {a) the Arbitrator shall be a neutral person, owing no subjection to the Governments of Najd, Trans-Jordan, Palestine, or 'Iraq, and holding no official position in any of those countries, and shall be a man of proper knowledge, experi ence, and honesty ; (b) the date of the conclusion of the Hadda Agreement, namely, the 2nd November, 1925 (15th Rabi' Thani, 1344) is to be taken as the starting-point for the liquidation of losses. No account will be taken of raids committed prior to that date ; all raids which may have occurred between that date and the date of the present Note will be covered by the arbitration ; (c) claims arising from raids, which may have come up for hearing before the Civil Courts, and in respect of which the said Courts may have already {i .e., prior to the date of the present Note) issued a judgment, will be settled in accordance with such judgment ; while claims on which no judgment has been passed by a Civil Court will be referred to the Arbitrator to be dealt with in the same way as other outstanding claims ;37 {d) it will be open to the Arbitrator to call any witnesses he may think necessary provided such witnesses are sum moned through the Government to whom they may be subject; {e) the Arbitrator shall communicate his conclusions con fidentially to the Government of the Hejaz and Najd and to the Government of Trans-Jordan before publica tion, and he shall fix a period during which those two Governments will be expected to submit their observations on his conclusions. On the expiration of the fixed period, even if either or both Governments fail to present their observations within the prescribed time, the Arbitrator shall proceed to draw up his final conclusions and publish them with the least possible delay in the form of a judgment which he shall communicate officially to the Governments ; (/') the judgment of the Arbitrator will be final and binding on both the Government of the Hejaz and Najd and the Government of Trans-Jordan, and will not be liable to appeal; {g) the remuneration of the Arbitrator and the expenses to be incurred in connection with this arbitration shall be borne by the Government of the Hejaz and Najd and by the Government of Trans-Jordan in proportion to the incidence of the award against each. 4. In communicating the above instructions to the Arbitrator, His Majesty's Government will impress upon him the advisability, before he embarks on the detailed examination of any claim, of satisfying himself that that claim is supported by reasonable evidence and that it had been formally communicated to the Government concerned in reasonable time after the occurrence of the raid. Your Majesty , ,, rc 5. As soon as a reply is received from your Excellency „ the Hejaz and Najd - , , that the Government of —Trans-Jordan— — are P re P are&lt; ^ s^mit to arbitration on the conditions proposed above, and to abide by and give effect to the judgment of the Arbitrator, His Majesty's Government will forthwith proceed to select and appoint a suitable person to carry out the proposed arbitration. I have, etc., His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary.38 No. 3. FOREIGN OFFICE TO THE ACTING BRITISH AGENT AND CONSUL, JEDUAH. 1 am directed by Lord Cushenden to inform you that Sir Gilbert Clayton has now reported to His Britannic Majesty's Government on his recent mission to the Hejaz. His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment have learnt with regret that he has been unable to reach any agreement with King Ibn Sa'ud on the major question at issue, namely, that of the advanced police posts in the southern desert of 'Iraq. In consequence it was not possible further to discuss the various subsidiary questions in regard to which it was desired that he should negotiate arrangements with King Ibn Sa'ud. 2. You will recall that in September of last year King Ibn Sa'ud addressed to the High Commissioner for 'Iraq a protest against the establishment by the 'Iraq Government of certain advanced police posts. Ihe post to which His Majesty took principal exception was one at Busaiyah, then in course of construction, which provided accommodation for some 15 police. The post was situated at a distance of 75 miles from the nearest point on the Traq-Nejd frontier. In his letter His Majesty represented that the construction of this post was contrary to the provisions of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol of the 2nd of December, 1922, which reads as follows ' The two Governments mutually agree not to use the watering places and wells situated in the vicinity of the border for any military purpose, such as building forts on them, and not to concentrate troops in their vicinity.' Some three weeks later King Ibn Sa'ud followed up this letter with a further protest. At this point it should be explained that the construction of the Busaiyah post and similar police posts was undertaken by the 'Iraq Government originally in response to a previous complaint by King Ibn Sa'ud that the measures taken by the 'Iraq Government to put a stop to tribal raids into Nejd territory had proved ineffective. The 'Iraq Government hoped by the establishment of these advanced police posts to facilitate the administration of the tribal areas and to obtain early information which would enable them to deal more effectively with raids across the frontier from either side. (No. 215.) (E.5184/3261/91.) Sir, Foreign Office, S.W.I, 1st November, 1928.39 3. In the latter part of October the High Commissioner replied through His Majesty's Agent to King Ibn Sa'ud pointing out that there was no foundation for the charge that the establishment of the Busaiyah post was a contravention of the Uqair Protocol and sending photographs and details of the post to demonstrate that, quite apart from the fact that it could not be described as in the vicinity of the border,' its small size and limited garrison rendered any description of it as ' a fort ' misleading. On 5th November, while this correspondence was in progress, a party of Mutair attacked the Busaiyah post and slaughtered its occupants, including, in addition to the garrison of six police, an official of the Public Works Department, twelve coolies, and a woman. After this attack there followed in quick succession a number of serious raids by Mutair tribesmen upon 'Iraq tribes. Strongly worded protests were sent to King Ibn Sa'ud, but these produced unsatisfactory replies, which, while admitting that in carrying out these raids the leader of the Mutair, Shaikh Faisal al Dawish, had acted in defiance of His Majesty's instructions, represented that the fault really lay with the 'Iraq Government in constructing the police post, and that if the post were abandoned the raids would cease. It seemed clear that the Mutair tribe had temporarily thrown off King Ibn Sa'ud's authority and were no longer under his effective control ; and this view was apparently substantiated by a warning which His Majesty conveyed to the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the effect that a large force of Akhwan were marching north contrary to his orders. In these circumstances. His Britannic Majesty s Government decided that there could no longer be any objection to the Royal Air Force in 'Iraq being authorised to pursue Akhwan raiders across the border in order to inflict, if possible, a lasting lesson upon them. This decision was communicated to King Ibn Sa'ud and was put into effect without delay. 4. In the meantime, these constant Akhwan raids had had the effect of seriously unsettling the 'Iraq tribe of Anizah, one of the most powerful tribal confederations in 'Iraq, lowards the end of December the High Commissioner reported that unless effective measures were taken to prevent further raids and to restore the confidence of this tribe, there was a serious danger that they would throw off their allegiance to 'Iraq. He explained that, owing to the immense stretch of frontier, and the great distance involved, it was almost impossible for British aircraft to catch the raiders red-handed and to inflict punishment upon them within Iraq territory. After full consideration His Britannic Majesty's Government decided to extend air action beyond the 'Iraq frontier in order to deny an area of grazing grounds to the Akhwan. Early in January and after the lapse of some two months since the initial incursion had taken place, during which further raids had occurred and King Ibn Sa ud had apparently taken no effective measures to restrain his recalcitrant40 subjects, the authority for the adoption of this measure was given and King Ibn Sa'ud was notified accordingly. Advance aircraft and armoured car bases were pushed forward to the vicinity of the frontier and notices were dropped warning tribes to move out of the area which was to be denied to the Akhwan. This action, coupled with constant air reconnaissances was sufficient to restore the confidence of the 'Iraqi tribes, and for some three weeks the raiding activities on the part of the Mutair were suspended. At the end of January, however, further raids occurred culminating in a raid upon 'Iraq and Koweit tribesmen by some two thousand of the Akhwan who penetrated to a depth of some sixty-five miles. The raiders were attacked by British aircraft and are understood to have suffered severe losses. 5. As you are aware. King Ibn Sa'ud had hitherto endeavoured to justify himself and his tribes by the contention that the 'Iraq Government had broken their treaty pledges and thus to excuse his failure to prevent the raids and to administer punishment. He now represented that the crossing of his frontier by British aeroplanes was a violation of his territory. These aeroplanes, he alleged, by bombing guilty and innocent alike had so outraged the feelings of his people that he had had to abandon measures which he had already set in motion for the control and punishment of the Mutair, his work of pacification had been destroyed and he could no longer control the feelings of his people. In regard to this allegation the High Commissioner for 'Iraq telegraphed* on the 19th of March in the following terms :— 'It is important to emphasize and to keep on emphasizing that no human beings have been bombed other than those pursued hot-foot after the raids in Koweit territory of 27th January and at Jarishan in 'Iraq on 19th February. A few bombs were dropped in the neighbourhood of encampments in the zone of operations within Nejd territory during the period 18th January to 2nd February in order to frighten them into obeying the warnings already scattered. Only four or five camels were killed. No human beings were hit.' 6. In response to the King's message. His Britannic Majesty's Government replied that in order to assist him to regain control and provided that His Majesty would give assurances that he would prevent further raids and would punish the offenders and exact full reparation, orders would be issued that no aircraft should cross the Nejd frontier except in hot pursuit of raiders. At the same time, His Britannic Majesty's Government repeated a suggestion previously made by them on several occasions that a meeting should be arranged between His Majesty and the British Resident in the Persian Gulf to discuss the questions in dispute. His Majesty did * 59086/28 [No. 259] ; not printed.41 not accept this invitation, nor did he give the assurances for which His Britannic Majesty's Government had asked, but merely reiterated his previous protests. Meanwhile, rumours became current that all the Akhwan were joining with the Mutair in a regular jihad (Holy War) against the non-Akhwan States of 'Iraq, Trans-Jordan and Koweit, and that King Ibn Sa'ud (himself powerless to prevent it) had been forced to associate himself witfi this movement. Later information, however, threw doubt upon these rumours, and indicated that King Ibn Sa'ud had dissociated himself from the movement. Subsequently, it became apparent that he had regained control. 7. Throughout his letters King Ibn Sa'ud maintained that the establishment of the Busaiyah post or any similar police posts was a contravention of the Uqair Protocol and he continued to press for its abolition as providing the only solution of the present trouble. His Britannic Majesty's Government for their part were not prepared to admit that the 'Iraq Government in constructing such posts acted otherwise than in full accord with their treaty obliga tions ; nor were they prepared to agree to the demolition of such posts. It seemed to them, however, that a full and frank discussion of the question in dispute might go far to convince King Ibn Sa'ud that his protests against the establishment of the Busaiyah post were unjustified, and that in this matter the action of the 'Iraq Govern ment had been entirely correct. To this end it was decided that Sir Gilbert Clayton should proceed to Jeddah to enter into personal discussion with King Ibn Sa'ud and to furnish him with such explanations and assurances as, it was hoped, would set at rest any genuine doubts which he might feel both as to the intentions of the 'Iraq Government in constructing such posts and as to the use to which it was proposed that they should be put. 8. The main point at issue now resolved itself into a difference of interpretation of the words ' in the vicinity of the border (Arabic : ala atraf al hudud) in Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol. It appeared that King Ibn Sa'ud had read into these words far more than they were intended to convey by His Britannic Majesty's Government. In his view the object of the Article was to prevent the erection of fortified posts at any of the wells situated in the open desert on either side of the frontier and at any distance from the frontier, and he contended that had not this been the intention he would have refused to ratify the Convention of Muhammara, to which the Protocol of Uqair was appended. Unfortunately, no detailed record of the conversations leading up to the signature of this Protocol exists. But Sir Percy Cox, the British Plenipotentiary, who represented the interests both of His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government at the discussions, has categorically affirmed that, on his part at least, the words in dispute were not intended to bear42 any strained or exceptional construction or to convey any meaning other than that which would ordinarily be assigned to them, namely, a short distance on either side of the frontier. While, therefore, it seemed clear that these words would not admit of the interpretation placed upon them by King Ibn Sa'ud, events had shown that they were, in fact, open to misunderstanding. Con sequently, it appeared to His Britannic Majesty's Government highly desirable in the interests of both parties that some means should be found of removing any element of ambiguity and eliminat ing the possibility of further dispute by the adoption of an accepted definition. Sir Gilbert Clayton was therefore authorised to suggest to King Ibn Sa'ud that they should be defined as meaning within some specified distance from the frontier and for this purpose a maximum distance of 25 miles was suggested as a basis for discussion. Alternatively, it was suggested that instead of a definition based upon distance from the frontier, certain wells on each side of the frontier should be specifically enumerated at which the construction of posts would be prohibited. 9. These suggestions were conveyed to King Ibn Sa'ud on the occasion of Sir Gilbert Clayton's first visit to Jeddah in May last. He was, however, as you will remember, unable to convince His Majesty that in constructing the advanced desert posts the 'Iraq Government had not contravened their treaty obligations ; nor could any progress be made towards arriving at an agreed inter pretation of the disputed words in Article 3 of the Protocol. The advent of the Pilgrimage season, which required the King's presence at Mecca for over a month, made it necessary to bring the conversa tions to a close in any case, and it was decided that Sir Gilbert Clayton should take this opportunity to return to England and report personally to His Britannic Majesty's Government. 10. On the receipt of Sir Gilbert Clayton's report, and on learning of the attitude taken up by King Ibn Sa'ud in the matter of the Uqair Protocol and the advanced posts, the whole question was re-examined by His Majesty's Government in consultation with the 'Iraq Government. After the fullest consideration. His Majesty's Government decided that in this matter they were unable to make any concession of principle. They held that, subject to existing treaty engagements which, in their considered opinion, were in no way infringed in the present case, the 'Iraq Government had every right to make what arrangements they deemed necessary for the administration of their tribes and of their desert areas, and that any attempt to interfere with this right must be resisted. Sir Gilbert Clayton was therefore instructed on his return to Jeddah to inform King Ibn Sa'ud accordingly, but at the same time to make it clear that the permanent system of administration to be adopted for this purpose had not yet been determined, and that it was proposed43 immediately to consider a reorganisation of the present system. Sir Gilbert Clayton was also authorised to inform King Ibn Sa'ud that it was the present intention of the 'Iraq Government to retain three advanced posts only, apart from such posts as might be required for the protection of the trans-desert route and of a pipe-line, if and when constructed, and apart also from posts so remote from the frontier as clearly to be of no interest to His Majesty. 11. Sir Gilbert Clayton was, furthermore, instructed to repeat to King Ibn Sa'ud the assurance of His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment and of the 'Iraq Government that these advanced posts were not designed for offensive purposes and that Nejdi tribes would suffer no interference with customary rights of watering, grazing, and peace ful movement at any of the points where advanced posts might be established. He was to add that the two Governments realised that friendly co-operation with His Majesty was a necessary condition of the satisfactory administration of the tribal areas and the mainte nance of peace in the desert, and that to this end they again suggested, for his serious consideration, the appointment of frontier representa tives on each side of the border who could confer together in the case of raids or other frontier incidents and could apprise each other, as also their own Governments, of any occurrence likely to disturb the tribes and thus the peace of the border. He was further to state that in order that King Ibn Sa'ud might be in a position to satisfy himself that any advanced post maintained by the 'Iraq Government was not being used for offensive purposes, and that there was no interference with any Nejdi tribes in their legitimate pursuits, the 'Iraq Government would welcome periodical visits to these posts by his frontier representative. Sir Gilbert Clayton was also instructed to endeavour once more to persuade His Majesty to adopt the pro posal put forward in May that the disputed words ' in the vicinity of the border ' used in Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol should be accepted as meaning within twenty-five miles of the frontier, except in the vicinity of the trans-desert route and contemplated pipe line, in which region, it was understood. His Majesty felt no objection in principle to the construction of protective posts. In addition, Sir Gilbert Clayton was authorised to inform His Majesty that, subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached in the matter of the advanced posts, the 'Iraq Government were prepared to conclude arrangements with King Ibn Sa'ud in regard to hon voisinage, extradition, the surrender of tribal offenders, the exchange of diplomatic representatives, etc., on the lines discussed with His Majesty's advisers on the occasion of Sir Gilbert Clayton s earlier mission, and in terms which were understood to be acceptable to His Majesty. 12. During the conversations of May King Ibn Sa ud had enquired whether His Majesty's Government regarded the provisions of44 Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, which stipulates that— ' the forces of 'Iraq and Nejd may not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders except with the consent of both Governments,' as applying to British as well as 'Iraqi forces. Sir Gilbert Clayton was instructed to assure His Majesty that His Britannic Majesty's Government fully intended to observe the stipulations of this Article, and that British forces would not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders. In the case, however, of an organised attack on a township or post—as opposed to a mere tribal raid—-or in the event of a series of raids with which His Majesty had proved himself unable or unwilling to deal, His Britannic Majesty's Government must reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they thought fit. Sir Gilbert Clayton was directed, when communicating this assurance to King Ibn Sa'ud, to invite His Majesty to explain the meaning which he himself attached to the term 'forces' in Article 6 when applied to the forces of Nejd. It was felt desirable that, in order to avoid the possibility either of genuine misunder standing or of equivocation, an acceptable definition of what must be held to constitute the ' forces ' of Nejd should be obtained from King Ibn Sa'ud, since it was understood that for military operations he had hitherto relied almost exclusively upon tribal elements of the nature of those which had recently carried out a number of raids against 'Iraq. 13. As you know, Sir Gilbert Clayton returned to Jeddah to conclude his interrupted conversations with King Ibn Sa'ud at the end of July, and he at once communicated to His Majesty the decision of His Britannic Majesty's Government in the matter of the advanced posts and the various assurances and explanations set out in the preceding paragraphs of this despatch. In doing so he emphasized the close attention which the matter had received, and the full consideration which had been given to His Majesty's views and arguments, and explained that, although unable to give way on the main principle involved, His Britannic Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government were prepared to go to great lengths to meet the Government of the Hejaz and Nejd in various other questions to which His Majesty had always expressed himself as attaching high importance. For example, the 'Iraq Government had expressed their willingness to waive their objections to the extradition of political offenders—a point which the Hejaz and Nejd Government had pressed for some time past. King Ibn Sa'ud replied that after having given the matter careful and mature reflection, he was unable to reconsider his attitude in regard to the advanced posts. He represented that on this question he was now pledged to his people, who would never be content with mere assurances in a matter which they held to be vita], and in which he personally shared their views to the full. Although still inspired by unalterable feelings of45 friendship towards Great Britain, and convinced that a policy of co-operation and amity with His Britannic Majesty's Government was in the best interests of his country, the question of the posts was one in which he was powerless to subscribe to the decision which His Majesty's Government had seen fit to make. Subsequent conversations failed to move King Ibn Sa'ud from this attitude ; although his demeanour throughout the resumed conversations was markedly friendly and even conciliatory, on the main point of principle he was entirely immovable. Consequently, as further argument would have been both useless and undignified, Sir Gilbert Clayton had no alternative but to inform the King that in the circumstances there was no course open to him but to terminate the conversations, return to England and report the failure to reach an agreement to His Britannic Majesty's Government. 14. It now remains only for His Britannic Majesty's Government to confirm through the official channel their decision in the matter of the Uqair Protocol and the advanced desert posts. You should accordingly communicate to King Ibn Sa'ud the note of which the English text, with Arabic translation,* is enclosed herein. I am, etc., MONTEAGLE. * Not printed.46 enclosure in no. 3. Draft of Proposed Note to King Ibn Sa'ud. November, 1928. Your Majesty, I have the honour to inform Your Majesty that I have been instructed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of His Britannic Majesty's Government, to address the following communication to Your Majesty. 2. His Britannic Majesty's Government, while fully appreciating the friendly spirit in which the recent conversations between Your Majesty and Sir Gilbert Clayton were held, have learnt with deep regret that these conversations have not resulted in any agreement on the major question at issue, namely, the interpretation of Article 3 of the First Protocol of Uqair. 3. His Britannic Majesty's Government have given the most careful and sympathetic consideration to the views and arguments put forward by Your Majesty, and they are particularly anxious to do everything in their power to assist Your Majesty in Your manifest efforts to maintain peaceful conditions on the frontier. But on the other hand, they cannot but regard it as a matter of fixed principle that the Government of every country is entitled, in the absence of specific undertakings to the contrary, to carry out such measures of internal administration within its territory as it may from time to time think necessary. The interpretation which Your Majesty seeks to place upon Article 3 of the First Protocol of Uqair is one which, in the opinion of His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Government of 'Iraq, is not only inconsistent with the text of the Article, but would involve an unwarrantable departure, to the detriment of 'Iraq, from the above-mentioned principle. It is for these reasons that Your Majesty's interpretation is unacceptable. 4. In the conversations which he was privileged to have with Your Majesty, Sir Gilbert Clayton emphasised the pacific and friendly nature of the reasons which had caused the 'Iraq Govern ment to construct and maintain certain posts in the desert. He also made it abundantly clear that the posts in question were not intended to interfere with the customary rights of grazing andwatering enjcwed by Nejd tribes, or to hamper their lawful move ments and migration across the desert areas of south-western 'Iraq ; and he gave Your Majesty explicit verbal assurances to that effect. Both His Britannic Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government desire formally to repeat those assurances which correctly represent their considered policy. 5. In earnest of their desire to arrive at a fair and peaceful settle ment of the question at issue, and to remove all obstacles in the way of consolidating the relations of amity and concord between the two Arab States, His Britannic Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government are prepared, should Your Majesty so desire, to submit the points in dispute to an arbitrator to be selected in consultation with your Majesty and in agreement between the Governments concerned. I am authorised formally to offer to Your Majesty this proposal of arbitration and to invite Your Majesty to inform me whether you are prepared to assent in principle to a settlement on that basis, so that the mode and conditions of the proposed arbitration may be discussed without delay. 6. His Britannic Majesty's Government desire to repeat the assurance given to Your Majesty by Sir Gilbert Clayton, to the effect that they regard the provisions of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement as applying to British as well as to 'Iraqi forces, and that they fully intend to observe the stipulations of that Article, provided, of course, that Your Majesty's subjects abstain from hostile acts of aggression of a nature and on a scale likely to endanger the security of 'Iraq. 7. His Britannic Majesty's Government hope that their proposal of a settlement by arbitration will commend itself to Your Majesty, not only for the sake of settling in a manner which is fair and honour able to all parties the points in dispute, but also because such a settlement would pave the way to the conclusion of formal agree ments on the various questions affecting Nejd, 'Iraq and Trans- Jordan which were discussed and agreed upon in principle by Your Majesty and Sir Gilbert Clayton. Those questions relate to agree ments on bon voisinage, extradition, the surrender of fugitives from justice, the appointment of diplomatic representatives and cognate questions. 8. If, on the other hand. Your Majesty should not agree to seek a settlement on this basis and would prefer, rather than have recourse to arbitration, to leave the question unsettled, with the resultant risk of unrest on the frontier. His Britannic Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government could only regret such a decision on the part of Your Majesty. 9. In that case, the Governments concerned must agree for the time being to postpone any settlement as to the true meaning of Article 3 of the First Protocol of Uqair. Nevertheless, the various48 treaties and agreements regulating the relations between the Govern ments concerned remain in full force and effect ; and it is the firm intention of His Britannic Majesty's Government and the 'Iraq Government scrupulously to observe the obligations imposed upon them by those instruments, and to direct their energies to the prevention of any incidents of a nature to provoke disturbances on the frontier or to disturb the friendly relations of the two countries. They are confident that Your Majesty will discharge your obliga tions with the same scrupulous regard, and they note with satisfaction Your Majesty's assurance to Sir Gilbert Clayton that the Government of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies intends strictly to observe the terms of all treaties and agreements in its relations with the neighbouring States. * 1 .0.
