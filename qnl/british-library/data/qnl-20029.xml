M.'s Consul and Political Agent, MUSCAT; To THE SECRETARY to the aOVER NMENT of INDIA, FOREIGN DBPART^IENT, CALCUTTA, Dated Muscat, January, 18th: 1901 S ir, Primarily, in connection with the increasing prac tical difficulty which the adequate supply of Welsh coal to the Depots in these waters seems from time to time to pre sent, and the very pronounced inferiority of the Indian article (of which the comparative consumption issued to be from 50 to 40 per cent greater for the same speed and dis tance) I have the honour to solicit the attention of the G-overnment of India to the possibilities presented by the existence of coal in Oman as a convenient source of supply lor our Muskat and Persian Gulf requirements. 2. The existence of coal in the Sultan's territory found mention m the Political Diary furnished weekly by this A- gency, some two years ago, in the following entry: May 22nd: 189R&gt; 'Shaikh Muhammad bin Mubarack of the Jene- boh of Soor has sent 50 bags of coal, about 5 tons, from Rafseh, a few miles distant from Soor. His Highness's En gineer pronounces it equal if not superior to Welsh coal, being entirely smokeless'. As the general question of coal supply was not then much m evidence, the above entry may possibly have escaped specifi6 notice at the time, I venture therefore to revert to it. While(111). While at Soor recently I 'book the opportunity of visiting the locality of Rafseh or rather 'Rufsheh', about 10 miles inland of Soor. It is easily reached from Soor by a good caravan road and the sheltered creek which surrounds the port of Soor offers every facility for export by- Dhow, The only reason I believe why His Highness Sayyid Feysal in has not hitherto essayed to take it,hand is that he has little authority over the tribe inhabiting the locality, Yfho maintain a to11gate on the caravam road in the vicinity whereat they levy transit fees on every laden animal that passes through, and would therefore view with suspicion and disfavour any civilized intrusion such as a trade in coal would bring, simply from the fear of losing the income they at present derive from the above form of blackmail. I do not imagine however that the their attitude would offer any serious difficulty and am of opinion that it might be got over by the Sultan subsidising them or giv ing them a royalty on the Coal; or by his building a fort in the neighbourhood, of the inexpensive pattern common in Oman and locating in it a garrison sufficiently strong to keep the tribesmen in hand. I may mention that there is no village of 'Rufsheh': The name simply represents that particular portion of the mari time range. Judging from the aspect of this range there is no reason to suppose that the coal is likely to be limited in quantity- on the contrary, according to my information it exists not only near Rufsheh but also at other points in the range i.e, Kalhat about 20 miles further up the Coast. 3. The idea of a coal trade from this Coast suggests ad -r vantageous possibilities in three directions. (I) I'k would be an obviously convenient source of sup ply for our coal Depots in these waters. (II) It would considerably improve the independent fi nancial position of the Sultan (though this perhaps is not wholly an advantage from one point of viewL(Ill) It would be the means of shedding in some degree light of civilization and publicity upon the port of So,or, a spot which has hitherto borne a time honoured and. unenviable notoriety as the principal emporium for the sup ply of negro slaves to meet the demand for them in Eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. 4. Apart from the above considerations moreover the exist ence of coal in the maritime range behind Soor and the vici nity seems to have an indirect bearing on the French Flag question, and in that connection to accentuate in no small degree the undesirability of our allowing the French or any other maritime power to raise a community of proteges and thus gain a footing and infuence on that part of the Coast of Oman. I respectfully commend the question therefore to the attention of the Government of India, and beg to inquire whether it may not be advisable to come to some arrangement with the Sultan on the subject. 5. In case Government may consider the matter of suffi cient importance to make early action desirable, I venture to submit this communication direct, but shall duly forwaBd a copy to the Resident by the next up 'mail.

Although the quality of the samples which Dr. von Krafft brought with him to India is satisfactory, the evidence for the occurrence of coal in any considerable quantity is so meagre that the Government of India are quite unable, upon the present data, either to invite capital for the working of the supposed mines, or to embark money in the scheme themselves. Before any such action is taken, it is necessary that a thorough and sustained geological investigation of the locality should be made; and I am to request that you will obtain the consent of the Sultan to the renewal of the examination at some convenient date. In reporting, through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the result of this reference to His Highness, with your suggestions as to how and when the investigation should be carried out, you should also give your opinion as to the form which, if it is eventually decided to work the coal, the enterprise may properly assume. In your letter No. 202, dated the 29th h-IVLI. May 1901, you were understood to suggest that the Sultan himself should work the scheme, and should provide coal to the British Government according to requirements at a fixed price per ton. It might, however, be preferable that A he coal should be worked directly by the British Government or . through the gency of a British firm upon specified conditions, and I am to invite an expression of your views upon this suggestion. 3.

After receiving orders on the 29tli March to proceed to Maskat and to Introduction. exani i ne certain occurrences of coal, which were reported from South Oman, I left Calcutta on the 2nd of April and arrived in Maskat on the 9th. In company of the Political Agent and Consul in Maskat, Captain P. Z. Cox, I proceeded on the 14th April to Kalhat, approxi mately 70 miles S.E. of Maskat, on the coast of Oman. Arriving there on the 17th, I first examined a locality, approximately 12 miles N.W. of Kalhat, where coal had been reported from, but the occurrence, which, was shown me by natives, proved to be carbonaceous shale of no economic value whatever. On the 20th April, we left Kalhat to proceed to a second locality, approxi mately 30 miles further S., where good coal had been found. Unfortunately we met with much opposition, and it was not until the 22nd of May that I was allowed to inspect one seam. The time spent in the coal district (afternoon of the 22nd and forenoon of the 23rd May) was insufficient to arrive at anything like a definite conclusion as to the amount of coal available. I, however, was able to take samples of coal with me, and it has been ascertained that the quality of the coal is very satisfactory. Before dealing with the coal, it will be appropriate to give a short sketch Geologicai of the geology of Oman, features. (Compare sketch map.)

In the coal district the Miocene series form an open syncline, the axis of which coincides roughly with a broad valley running S.E.-KW. Into this main valley lead a number of small ravines from S.W., and in one of these the outcrop of coal, which I inspected, occurs. This outcrop is as follows :— The ravine is from 70 to 150 feet wide and is bordered by steep walls of rock. On the S.E. bank, at a few hundred yards from the main valley, the coal exposure is met with, which has a length of 22 yards. The beds dip down the ravine, their dip being steeper than the gradient of the former. The seam, therefore, disappears towards the main valley under the surface, while it rises out of the ground up the ravine (S.W.^ so that the base of the coal is exposed at the S.W. termination of the outcrop. Here the seam is concealed by debris for a short distance, under which it apparently thins out, as it does not re-appear higher up the ravine. Nothing but an unworkable bed of carbonaceous shale was found in this direction. The coal is underlain by an ochrey shale, while the beds immediately over lying the coal consist of canbonaceous shale of several feet thickness. Above this follow shaly and concretionary limestones, which rise in a perpendicular wall of from 50 to 60 feet. The seam is at the outcrop 4 8' thick. From this exposure nine coal samples were taken and tested in the Labora tory of the Geological Survey Office. As the rocks were over- Sampies. hanging, it would have been impracticable to dig far into the seam. The samples, therefore, had to be taken from the surface, where the coal was to a certain extent weathered. Two * See p ' 3 ' of the samples,* mz. y D. 50 and D. 49, are from the top of the seam, two (D. 67 and D. 66) from the base, all the rest are from the middle of the seam. The history of B. 37 is unknown. I received it from a native, but am not sure whether it comes from the same locality or a different one. As to the composition of the coal compare the accompanying table, page Composition 3. The first group of tests shows the percentage of moisture, of coal. volatile matter, fixed carbon and ash. The second gives the composition of coal of which the moisture has been extracted before assaying. The samples gave all much the same results.

Sur coal is remarkably free from sulphur. No iron pyrites were observed. Very little but the coal is impregnated with a small amount of hydrous iron oxyde, resulting no doubt from the decomposition of iron pyrites. ,. 10 samples assayed, 6 gave a white ash, in 2 only the ash shows a distinct brown colouring, while two are buff coloured.

At a Probably cak- first glance the coal might be taken, for a non-caking coal, tng coal. but this is by no means certain, nor even probable. It is known that some coals lose their caking properties after having been exposed to weathering. As mentioned above, the Sur coal samples were weathered, and as there is one among them that cakes, it seems very likely that the coal was originally a caking coal, but has for the most part lost its caking properties by weathering. The average specific gravity of Sur coal is 1*338. A ton of this coal^ there- 26-7 cubic feet fore, contains 26 '7 cubic feet. The specific gravity is somewhat = i ton. higher than in Cherrapunji coal* (Assam). In Phillips's list of 43 assays of British coals, I can find only two which have a higher specific gravity. , Welsh coal. Hill's Plymouth Works, s.g. 1*35. Lancashire coal, Ince Hall, Pemberton Yard, s.g. 1*348. Sur coal crumbles easily, and the samples fell partly to dust on the trans- Friability. port to Calcutta. Priability of coals may be due to mechanical pressure or to weathering. As the Sur coal has undergone practically no pressure, the beds including it being but slightly raised, its friability may safely be attributed to weathering. The Sur coal will, I suppose when freshly raised from below the surface, be of medium hardness, but it will no doubt deteriorate more or less rapidly by keeping. The friability of the coal is hardly a great disadvantage. I have been informed by experienced businessmen that the market value of coal is not affected by its more or less crumbly condition, as the gratings can easily be adjusted. I have further satisfied myself by an inspection of Assam coal depots at Garden Reach near Calcutta that Assam coal, which is used advan tageously in ocean-going steamers and sells in Calcutta at Its. 17 a ton, is of a very crumbly condition. I, therefore, suppose that the fabrication of briquettes (' patent fuel') will not be necessary. As to the distribution of the coal and the amount of workable coal Total quan- available but little information could be gained, tity of coal not ascertained. I have shown above that at the outcrop described the coal dips under the surface in one direction (N.E.), while it disappears towards the other (S.W.). Opposite the outcrop, at the N.W. bank of the ravine, no trace of coal was found, which in the absence of other reasons must be attributed to the coal thinning out and disappearing towards N.W. There is, however, an indication of the coal seam extending towards S.E. In a second ravine, running parallel with the one described, and at least one hundred yards further S.E., traces of coal were found, which I am convinced belong to the same seam. At the S.E. bank of this ravine, the carbonaceous shales were noticed, and by digging away the debris I could ascertain that they are at least of the same thickness, if not thicker than at the coal exposure. Un fortunately the coal, which must lie below these shales, was not reached, as my work was interrupted by the natives, but traces of coal were found in the ravine itself below some boulders. The evidence gained as to the distribution of the seam examined can be summarised as follows :— There is a workable seam of coal which from the exposure thins out towards S.W. and N.W., but continues at least a .hundred yards towards S.E. The seam further must continue for some distance towards N.E., as there is no indication of its thinning out in this direction. * LaTouche Eecords, XXII, page 169.6 It is, however, almost certain that the coal is of much greater distribution This is to be concluded from geological reasons and from native report* received, r 8 The formation in which the coal is found appears to preserve the same characteristics over a distance of several miles, and as these characteristics are proved to be consistent with the occurrence of workable coal, it is reasonable to expect that the seam examined is not the only one or else of larger extent. This conclusion is to a certain extent borne out by native reports, of which one related by a bama in Maskat may here be communicated, as it contains nothing that did not agree with facts known to myself. From the description of the hania I gathered that there is an exposure of coal in the mam valley alluded to above to the S.E. of the locality which I inspected. It is quite uncertain how far this exposure is distant from the one 1 examined. It is described as being a superficial exposure in the bottom of the valley, that is to say, the overlying limestones have there for some distance been denuded away. The length of the exposure is said to be 300 feet. The thickness of the seam 4 to 5 feet, and the coal is described as crumbling easily. These data would point to the exposure belonging to the same seam as that seen by myself, but in the absence of further proofs it would of course be wrong to draw more definite conclusions. The data, therefore, on which to form an estimate of the total quantitv of available coal are insufficient, but there is reason to suppose that the seam examined by me is ei her not the only one, or else is of large enough extent S justify mmmg operations. 5 tu Por mining the Sur coal offers several important advantages. The coal is Co 5^S s for 7 r 6 ln places ex P osed superficially, and can therefore I -i * suppose, to some extent be extracted in open workings. Where covered by overlying rocks, its vertical depth from the surface will be found inconsiderable. The overlying limestone beds afford a firm roof.

His Highness is willing that a second investigation should take place at any season convenient to government but tells me that he would like to be at hand himself at the time and on that and other grounds of expediency asks that the opera tions be either completed before the incidence of the fast ing month of Ramzan or deferred till the conclusion of it. Ramzan will fall between December 13th and January 11th next* Presuming that for a sustained geological survey and inves tigation a stay of six weeks or two months in the locality would be necessary, I am of opinion that there are advantages in completing the operations before the beginning of Ramzan and that they should therefore commence not later than the 16 th15'th Oc-tober. At present there are only 50 or 60 tons of coal at the French deppt and so it is unlikely that any of their men-of-war will be up here for the time being. It is within your knowledge however that they are negociating with shippers for the dis patch of a large quantify to Muscat,which means that later on they will be in a better position to make difficulties for us if so disposed. Another point is that the French Vice—Consul Monsieur Laronce being new to Muscat and not having as jjfet made the acquaintance of Soor is at present less able to do harm than his predecessor was. As soon as the cold weather commences however and F(fl?nch ships begin coming up he will cer tainly pay the place a visit and cultivate interest there. The only ^objection I have to offer to an early start is that if,as seems probable,officials and gear connected with the, landing of the Telegraph cable arrive about the beginning of October,my own presence might be needed in Muscat. Any incon venience in this direction however will be in a great measure obviated if,as I take for granted will be the case,on^of H.M.'s ships will be specifically detailed to remain in these waters during the coal prospecting operations. I could then visit Muscat occasionally for a few hours if .Q-coaai-gm arose. 5. The manner in which the investigation can best be._ carried out . It will be remembered that on the last occasion the Musharifeh ^^lan^who were then regarded as being entirely subordinate to the Beni Abu Hassan^ignored the latter and combined with all the rest of the Hinawi tribes in obstructing our progress, the Beni Abu Hassan remaining loyal to us throughout. During the past week the Shaikhs of the last nemed tribe have sent a communication to Seyyid Feisal informing him that the Musharifeh repentant of their conduct have broken with the Hin awi and committed their interests to the Beni Abu HassaSi as of.old^and -bhat in ord'er 'bo shew their bona fides 'fchey ask His Highnesses permission to come 'bo Muscat, 'bo express in person their readiness to render obedience to his commands in fu ture. By the same messenger the chief Beni Abu Hassan Shalk sent -me a civil letter saying that all was quiet now and that they would be glad to see me again in their country whenever I felt inclined to come. It would T think be an ad vantage if the visit of these Musharife^i Shaikhs to Muscat could be arranged Just before the expedition starts, so that if their attitude gave any grounds for doubting their sin cerity the Sultan would know how to proceed. In this 'toiew and in order to give time for this communica tion to reach G-overnment, I asked him to reply that he is pre pared to receive the Musharifeh Elders if their protestations are sincere and if they come under the wing of the Beni Abu Hassan Shaikhs,but that owing to the prevalence of the mon soon sea the season is not favourable for their coming ijust at present and that they should postpone it until he sends them a further commujiication. By the light of this letter from the Beni Abu Hassan the Sul tan was of opinion that a second investigation could now be carried out without difficulty by relying entirely on that tribe. I replied that in view of the way in which the Mu sharifeh had snapped their fingers at the Beni Abu Hassan before,I thought it was inadvisable to be too sanguine as to the sincerity or permanency of their present attitude. I continued 'Government have not suggested anything of the 'sort to me,but we may take it for granted that they would 'not care to run any risk of a second expedition ending un- 'satisfactorily. Supposing they were to entertain the idea 'of sending ah escort of Native Troops with us,what would be 'Your Highnesses views with regard to such a course?' He replied that so far as he was concerned he was ready to fallyi fall in wi-bh the wishes of Government in any way desired,but he personally thought that to bring British troops on to the scene would only be to revive and increase the hostility of the disaffected Hinawi,who would think that the contingency of 'British occupation' of Soor and the vicinity which the French Consul and, French papers had promised them had actual ly come to pass. In this view I am disposed, to concur. If any sepoy escort we're taken at all SO or 30 men would in my opinion be of no practi cal use,their presence would rather tend to disturb the in habitants and encourage opposition. To be of service such an escort would have to be sufficiently strong to cope with any possible opposition that might be met with and I should put the necessary strength at not less than 200 men with 8 machine guns. I do not think that the tribes would in any case meet us in open fight but the country is a difficult one to move in and offers facilities for ambuscading which would no doubt be taken advantage of. It may be presumed also that the land ing ,of any troops under circumstances which could be exaggera ted and misrepresented by French emissaries would afford ma terial to Aysa bin Saleh and, the Hinawi Shaikhs for preaching a religious 'Jehad' and 5 thus rousing most of the Hinawi tribes men to take arms against us. If there was a little more time at disposal I would ask Gov ernment to allow me in the first place to go down and pay the Beni Abu Hassan a quiet visit of a month or so in their villa ges in the hope of being able to disarm suspicion and prepare the way for a subsequent leisurely survey and investigation, ' but it is difficult for me to get away just now and leave Mus- '' ■' ~ . ' , ■ ' , , ■ „ ■ oi cat to take care of itself for any considerable time. The al ternative which I would propose is this. That the Musharifeh and Beni Abu Hassan should pay their wished^vi'sit to the Sul tan as soon as practicable and that we should inform the Sul tan that we expect him t(!f make efficient arrangements with the helphelp of the Beni.AjDU Hassan to ensure our 'being able to spend one or two months in safety and at leisure in their country, To provide against any risk of failure by this means,I suggest that one of the Indian Marine Steamers with two or three companies of Native Infantry stand by at Khor Jerama in case of emergency,and the natives^given to under stand that if any difficulties are put in our way troops will be landed. The question of transport and commissariat for the troops if they were required to land would have to be considered but the distance to be travelled would in any case probably not be more than a forced march of 80 or 30 miles from the port of debarkation and this question would not offer any insurmountable difficulty, (4.) The last point on which T was directed to report was as to the best means of working the coal . In forming the opinion expressed in my preliminary report on this point I did not anticipate that the samples .of coal would prove of such satisfactory quality as the analysis has shown. Since receipt of Foreign Department letter under re ply I have discussed with the Sultan the question .of direct working by Government or by private company. His Highness is willing to leave the decision on this point to Government^ the details to be arranged subsequently. It is difficult for me to offer any opinion on the financial aspects of these alternative methods which would be of any value,I can only express the view that from a local stand point the advantage seems to me to lie with an arrangement by which the British Government would work the seams direct ly. If a private company were to undertake the work the Sul tan would have to guarantee adequate protection to the en terprise and it is not improbable that the British authori ties would be troubled a good deal with disputes between the Companyand the Sultan and his subjects. If we are to be burdened with any responsibility ot this nature it would seem profitable to bear it for ourselves and save the coimnission of the mi'ddle- ■man. In either case the bearing ; of article 4 of our Treaty of 1891 with Muscat will have to be taken into account, by which 'His Highness the Sultan of Muscat binds himself not ^ 'to allow or to recognise the establishment of any 'kind of monopoly or exclusive privelege of trade in 'with his dominions to any Government,association A ' s 'or individual.' I do not see' anything in the Sultan's engagements tKat with Prance on which they could claim^this clause could be enforced as against ourselves,but it will be remembered that the doctrine of equal, rights in Muscat is one on which French officials have frequently taken their stand of late. 5. The question of the transport of the coal to the coast to which Dr von Krafft invites attention in his report does not I think present any serious difficulty. It might be got over by the laying of a liljtb tramway from Soor, or Khor Jerama ; according as a survey of the ground may prove cont?eni- ent.

I have the honour to report that Dr. Oldham has concluded his geological examination of the coal exposures in this district, and is leaving to-day, for Maskat and India in H. M. S. Perseus, Captain Dowding, of the Intelligence Branch, and I, remain here for the present, pending receipt of replies from the Shaikhs of the Beni Abu Ali regarding a visit to their tribe in Jailan and passage thence to Maskat by land. His Highness the Sultan also remains here for the present, superintending the building operations which are going jon in connection with the improve ment of his arrangements for the realization of his revenue at Sur. 2. I have asked the Senior Naval Officer in these waters to be good enough to send H. M. S. Perseus or H. M. S. Assaye back to Sur after the arrival of the mail steamer on 27th instant either to convey us back to Maskat, or, in case we have left in the meanwhile for the interior, to communicate with the Sultan regarding his return to Maskat, should he then be ready to leave Sur. 3. Without prejudice to the full report which Dr. Oldham will subse quently submit, I understand from him that his inspection of the exposures of coal leads him to the conclusion that the seams existing are rather of the nature of ' pockets ' and that, whereas sibme 200,000 tons are probably avail able, the general prospect is not sufficiently good to warrant the inception of mining operations. 4. The Beni Abu Hassan and Musharifeh have been perfectly well- disposed to us throughout, and the expedition has experienced no practical difficulties. I learn on return here to fhe coast that Aysa-bin-Saleh has been writing letters to his partisans in Sur, endeavouring to stir them up against the Sultan's building operations, and expressing (to the Sultan) his intention of proceeding to the coal district to stop our work, but owing to the Sultan's satisfactory arrangements with the Beni Abu Hassan and the support of our men-of-war his threats have fallen flat.

In continuation of my letter of proceedings, dated the 15tb October 1901 (Maskat No. 21), I have the honour to report that, in accordance with the arrangements reported to you therein, H. M. S. Assaye left Maskat at 11 a.m. on October 15th, with orders to proceed to Karachi at sufficient speed to catch the mail steamer leaving that port on the evening of the 17th. 2. On the 18th October, His Highness the Sultan of Oman visited me in return for my official call upon him a few days previously, and was saluted on disembarking with 21 guns. 3. At 6-45 p.m . on Friday, October 25th, I left Maskat, with telegrams from the Political Agent and arrived at Jask at 11 a.m . on the 26th. On the morning of the 27th I received a telegram from the Assaye reporting the arrival at Karachi of Mr, Oldham, the Indian Government Geologist, that the Assaye would sail (for Khor Jerama, near Sur, understood) on the 28th, and that the embarkation of a Military Intelligence officer had been authorised by you. 4 I accordingly left Jask at 5 p.m . on the 27th October and arrived at Maskat at 10 a.m . on the 28th. 5. Target practice with heavy and light Q. T. guns was carried out on the morning of the 28th, half the quarterly allowance (reduced by the surplus used in prize firing the previous quarter) being expended, and all guns that could bear firing together in accordance with A. L. of 21st March 1899, paragraphs. An officer was stationed to mark for each 4s' gun, and a petty officer for each 3 pr. 6. On arriving at Maskat I was informed by the Political Agent that the Sultan would not be ready to embark before the morning of the 30th (instead of the 29th as previously arranged) owing to the arrival at Maskat of the Sheikhs of the Beni Abu Hassan and Musharifeh tribes, in whose country the coal fields proposed to be explored are situated. It was the Musharifeh tribe (insti gated by the Prench) that opposed the last expedition which was sent to explore the coal-fields, and wbich was therefore unable to complete its investigations. These Sheikhs had come to Maskat to offer their submission to the Sultan, and to express their willingness to permit the proposed new exploration to be carried out. 7. On the morning of Wednesday the embarkation of the Sultan's guard and of the above Sheikhs with their retinues was carried out, the total number ing 150. His Highness the Sultan and Captain Cox, the Political Agent, having been embarked, I sailed from Maskat at 8 a.m ., on that day, the 30th October, proceeding at moderate despatch speed in order to reach Khor Jerama before dark. 8. Khor Jerama had been selected as the best starting point for the ex pedition, as the road from that place is better than the one from Sur. Onoe started, however, the exploring party intend to maintain communication only with Sur, where the Sultan will remain. 9. Up to this date and for the past fortnight the weather had been very fine and the sea calm. After leaving Maskat, however, a fresh northerly breeze set in, and on arriving off Khor Jerama a considerable sea was running,e N making the disembarkation inconvenient, though not actually dangerous. The anchorage is entirely exposed, and an unpleasant one to lie at with the rocky steep coast as a close lee shore, and a confused sea. | 10. The steam cutter and three pulling cutters conveyed the local natives Waal, (about ninety in number) ashorej with the exception of a few leading men who remained with the Sultan. It was after dark when these boats entered the channel leading into the Khor, and on their arrival inside the harbour found : 19(11, there H. M. S. Assays as I expected, though the intervening high land made her presence unknown upon my arrival. 11. The Commanding Officer of the Assaye declined to allow any of the boats to go out of the harbour during the night, on account of the sea run ning at its entrance ; but on the morning of the 31st the steam cutter returned, iian Stay tlie Lieutenant in charge reporting that the sea at the entrance of the harbour to , J prevented his getting the cutters out, and that he had ordered them to remain ^ inside until the weather moderated. The Sultan being anxious to disembark at Sur, and as he was to make arrangements for the supply of 100 camels Ui i for the expedition, further delay was inadvisable. I therefore weighed at ccald 'j.so a m ., and proceeded to Sur, arriving and anchoring off that town at 9 a.m . Baghalas came off from the shore, and, despite the heavy sea, landed the ted me i t Sultan and his guard. His Highness being saluted on leaving the ship with saluted | twenty-one guns. 12. At 2 p.m . the Sultan being landed, I weighed anchor aud returned to telegrai the former anchorage off Khor Jerama, arriving at 3-30 p.m . Having no li. Ojtlt means of communicating with the Assaye except by boat, I sent Lieutenant lortiDgl Bevan in the whaler to bring off one of the cutters, which I required in order stjtyi to disembark Captain Cox, Prince Timor (son of the Sultan), and his party, 28M baghalas not being obtainable at Khor Jerama. The whaler safely got inside ihoryij tlie harbour entrance, and into smooth water, but one of the cutters came out at 9 p.m ., and reported that the whaler had been capsized in a squall inside the iarriTeii barbour. An hour later Lieutenant Commander B. M. Lambert came on board and reported that Lieutenant Bevan and the whaler's crew were safely on board , , | the Assaye, and that the boat and most of its gear had been recovered bv the 101011 Assaye 1 s boats, iirplus iffl that coil 13 * On the morning of Priday, November 1st, the sea having moderated ar J somewhat, I was able to disembark Captain Cox, Prince Timor and their irforol P ar ties and baggage, and in the afternoon got all the boats back and hoisted: a considerable sea was still running, and in the course of the three days' opera- ^ jy I tions the boats have unavoidably suffered from damage and losses. ;b (instil 14. The Assaye being able to lie inside the Khor Jerama, an entirely yieffl land-locked and sheltered harbour, which His Majesty's ship under my command Ml is unable to enter, I directed the Assaye to remain there until the exploring ribe M P ar ^y (^ 0 which she will render any .required assistance) Jiave started; and tfoe jpl c[! immediately afterwards, weather permitting, to proceed to Sur and remain .y onSi there, in accordance with the Political Agent's wishes. In case of bad weather, 3 „ r Khor Jerama is available, and land communication with Sur can be arranged SU temporarily. 15. The outer anchorages at Khor Jerama and at Sur being very unsatis- , j ; factory in the northerly wind and sea prevailing, and the Assaye being ^ y more useful inside the harbour than I would be outside, I left Khor Jerama alD . J at 5 p.m ., on the 1st instant, and proceeded to Maskatwith the mails of both ' al =J ships, arriving at 7 a.m . to-day. On the arrival of the English mails due here ' ! J on the 6th I propose to return to Sur, when I hope to find the weather more i0rt) moderate by that time, and to remain there, sending the Assaye with mails to Maskat on the 8th to await the English mails due there on the 12th instant. f ^ 16.

Oldham's report of an examination of the coal localities south of Sur in Oman, Arabia, and request that a copy of it may be sent for record in this Department. REPORT OF AN EXAMINATION OF THE COAL LOCALITIES SOUTH OF SUR IN OMAN, ARABIA. 1. Embarking on board H. M. S. As &amp;aye I left Karachi on 28th October and reached Khor Jerama on 30th October. On 31st October I was joined by Captain P. Z. Cox, His Majesty's Consul at Maskat, and on 1st November we landed. After devoting a day to the measurement of a base line and starting the topographical survey we left Khor Jerama on 3rd November. Two long marches brought us to Musweh, the first of the localities at which coal was known to exist. The five days from 5th to 9th November were devoted to investigating this locality. On 10th November I visited the second of the reported localities, Jebel Khami, and on 11th November we marched to Migel, in the Eisao valley, the locality which was visited by Dr. von Krafft and Captain Cox in May last. Three days proved sufficient for the investigation of this locality, and on 15th November we left it, arriving at Suk Sur on 16th November. Here I was detained till 21st November, when I embarked on H. M. S. Perseus and reached Maskat the following day 2. Of the geology of the country traversed it is not necessary to say much, as the opportunities for making observations other than those directly bearing on the coal were small. The rocks seen on the route differ somewhat from those noticed by Dr. von Krafft, the lower part of his section being only imper-' lectly represented, while the open country between Khor Jerama and the Musawi hills is composed of a much contorted series of rocks, of unknown age,7 whose prevailing colours are red and white. These are unconformably over laid by beds of eocene, probably upper eocene, age. 3. The country passed through was everywhere barren to a degree and covered by an almost continuous sheet of stones, shattered by the intensity of the heat they are exposed to, and the rapid changes of temperature at sun rise and sunset. A few stunted thorn bushes and a few dried up tufts of herbage are all that can be seen in the way of vegetation, and animal life was represented by a few birds, one hare, four bats, and numerous flies. At Ealiz and from Faliz on to Suk Sur fresh water is found in the Wadi Faliz, but else where there are only a few scattered water holes of small size and yielding a limited supply of brackish water. 4. The coal is found among rocks of tertiary age, classed by Dr. von Krafft as miocene, which occur in the centre of a synclinal, and are, consequently, the newest rocks of the district. The outcrop ends, by the closing in of the synclinal, about 4 miles north of Migel on the one hand and 3 miles south of Musweh on the other, giving a total length of about 10 miles, along which the dip of the rocks is towards the centre from either side. 5. The first locality visited was about half a mile south of the camp at Musweh water. Here there is a stretch of low-lying level ground, carved out by a stream from between two beds of hard sandstone, about 200 yards long by 30 broad, which is shown in the photograph. In this and in the stream beds draining down from the east there are numerous exposures of coal; after clear ing and opening up the coal seams at the southern (further) end of the low ground, the section given in the right hand column of the statement appended was measured. It will be seen from this that eighteen seams were found on this section of which two measured over 4 feet in thickness. At first sight this looks promising enough, but there were soon facts tending to modify the first favour able impression. In the next ravine to the south, not half a mile off, an excellent section is exposed of the rocks occupying precisely the same horizon as the coal seams, and here not a trace of coal is to be seen. There is no room for doubting that the coal is really absent and not merely hidden, for it happens that there is a freshly exposed section on the hillside extending right across the whole thickness of the beds in which the coal was seen, and had there been a trace of coal it could not have escaped detection. 6. Having seen this I returned to the original locality to investigate it as fully as possible. With this object I had a fresh set of pits opened, along the outcrops of the coal seams, at about 450 feet from the first set, that being as far as I could go without finding the outcrops covered with a thick deposit of boulders, which would have necessitated much work to clear the outcrops. Along this line, whose section is given in the left hand column of the statement, I found three seams, not represented on the southern section, while one seen on the southern is not represented on the northern section. This does not, however, fully exhibit the variability of the seams in thickness, for No. 1 seam, which has a thickness of 1 foot 10 inches on the northern, and of 1 foot 7 inches on the southern section, was found to have a thickness of nearly 4 feet about half-way between the two. No. 7 seam, which has a thickness of 1 foot 8 inches on the northern section, was found to thin out to 14 inches at 100 feet to the southwards along the outcrop, to inches at 150 feet, and at 200 feet it had come to an end, and could not be found. 7. A still more striking evidence of the limited extent of these coal seams was found when I came to try and trace their extension to the southward. With this object I had a trench cut across the hillside at a distance of about 250 feet measured up a slope of some 15°. This trench is just visible in the photograph ; it was very shallow, but carried down to the solid rocks along its whole length, which, as will be seen from the photograph, crosses the continu ation of the same series of beds in which the seams Isos. 1 to 7, including the two 4-feet, seams, are found Yet in spite of this, and of the small distance from the thick outcrops not a trace of coal could be found. 8. Trom these facts it appears that the coal at Musweh does not occur in extensive seams, but in mere pockets, which may reach a good workable thick ness in places, but rapidly thin out. Such pockets are of no use, except to - ^supply fuel for local purposes from surface workings,—and for this there is no' local demand. 9. The outcrops just described are not the only ones that were seen in these rocks. Close to the water hole at Musweh camp is a band of coal 18 inched thick'; a band of shaly coal is found in the ravine south of the coal valley &lt; in a tributary on the opposite side of the main valley three seams of coal, of from 4 to 8 inches in thickness, are found ; and about two miles down streafif from Musweh camp a thin string of coaly shale was seen. Evidently the. conditions, under which the coal-bearing rocks were formed, were sueh as? favoured small accumulations of vegetable matter, but not the formation of extensive coal seams. 10. The second locality visited was Jebel Khami, on the eastern slope of the Musawi range. The coal occurs in rocks which belong to the same series' as those in which the Musweh coal is found, but lower down in it. There were a couple of thin bands of coal, associated with thick beds of carbonaceous shale and evidently as inconstant as the Musweh coals. 11. Having examined the Jebel Khami and Musweh localities, we wettf on to Mi gel, which is in the same field as Musw^eh, though in a different drainage basin and separated by a ridge of about 500 feet in height. Here I saw the outcrop examined by I)r. von Krafft, a good exposure of nice looking; coal, which would have been regarded as very promising but for the experience gained at Musweh. The anticipation that it too would thin out very rapidly; was strengthened by the variation of thickness along the exposure: one measurement gave 4 feet 9 inches, another 16 feet off gave 5 feet 1 inch, and a third, obtained 12 feet further on by digging out the extreme end of the expo* sure, gave 3 feet 2J inches. This pointed to a rapid thinning out. but I soon found that the coal extended further than at first sight seemed ^ probable. Up the valley I found two exposures on the same side, and about 800 yards up, under a cliff, over which the water falls on the rare occasions when the stream flows, there was a deep cut recess at the back of which an exposure of carbonaceous shale was seen. On clearing this out and digging downwards the coal seam was found, with a thickness of 4 feet 6 inches. 12. This coal seam can be picked up with ease, as it and the associated shales are over and underlaid by two peculiar rocks. The overlying one is a calcareous sandstone, passing into limestone, composed of large spheroidal con-' cretionary masses of a blue grey colour set in a buff coloured matrix: the underlying rock is a massive, hard, white sandstone. Led by these guides it was found that the exposure of carbonaceous shale in the next ravine to the south, mentioned by Dr. von Krafft in his report, was on the same horizon as the original exposure, I had an excavation made here and found the coal was only 1 foot 8 inches thick, overlaid by about 8 feet of carbonaceous shale; half I a mile further up this stream I found another exposure of carbonaceous shale, and, after digging down through 8 feet of it, found that the coal had dwindled to only 9 inches in thickness. 13. No other exposure of the coal seam, or of rock on its horizon is seen on this side of the valley, but about a mile to east-north-eastward of the camp at Migel the white sandstone is found in the bed of a stream, and above it the, rock composed of blue grey spheroids set in a buff matrix. On searching the v ground between these two rocks I found an exposure of coaly matter in the stream bed and another on the valley side. On opening out this exposure the coal was found to be only 2 inches in thickness. 14. Besides the coal of the seam seen by Dr. von Itrafft I saw two others in this valley, both at lower horizons. The lower of these is exposed about half a mile up stream and the other further down, between the two coals already mentioned; the lower coal is only 6 inches thick and the other 7 inches. 15. Prom the measurements recorded in the preceding paragraphs it will be seen that von Krafft's coal seam, though more extensive than those at Musweh, thin out in a short distance. The exposures seem to indicate, however, that there may be an area of as much as a quarter of a mile square with a thickness of 4 feet and more. This gives some 250,000 tons ox9 workable coal ; this would certainly be worked if it were found in an easily accessible region where there was a good demand, and once mining works were established, doubtless, other similar patches of coal would be discovered, and so a moderate supply might be kept up for many years. Eor this reason it will be well to consider the other conditions on which the possibility of profitable working depends. 16. Ihe natural outlets for the coal must be either Sur or ILhor Jerama. The latter is a land-locked, harbour, with a narrow entrance, which presents no serious difficulty to steamships drawing up to 16 feet, provided they enter and leave against the tide. In this harbour, completely land-locked and having an extreme rise and fall of tide of 9 feet at springs, a jetty could easily be constructed from which coal might be loaded directly into ships. From Khor Jerama to Musweh would require a railway of at least 30 miles 1 ^ l eil ?th; at about 5 miles from the harbour there is a couple of miles of broken ground, where a good deal of earthwork would be required to make a line, even one with sharp curves and steep gradient, but with this exception the line would run over open plains, where hardly any embarkments or cut tings would be required, till the last 4 miles into Musweh, which would be through a hill valley and difficult and expensive to construct. If the coal in the Fisao valley was to be tapped, there would be a very difficult and expensive piece of line over, or through, the 500 feet ridge separatinsr the two valleys. 17. If Sur was adopted as the outlet, the country traversed would be more difficult on the whole than that between Musweh and Khor Jerama. The dis tance by camel track is about 26 miles, but any railway would have to be longer than this, and probably not less than 35 miles. Of this, the first 5 miles from Migel is hilly to a degree which would make the alignment of even a light railway expensive and difficult. At Sur there are practically no facilities for shipping the coal; there is a backwater in which a jetty might be constructed, but the water in this is too shallow to admit of the entry of even small steamers and the jetty could only be used for loading lighters, from which the coal would have to be transhiped into vessels lying at anchor in an open roadstead. For this reason it would probably be better to adopt Khor Jerama as the outlet, were there a sufficient quantity of coal to justify the expense of getting it out. 18. All labour would have to be imported, as there is none locally procurable. The inhabitants of the country are unwilling to undertake regular labour, and would be useless if they were willing. 19. All timber would also have to be imported, as the country produces none, even firewood would have to be imported, or brought from a distance, as the demands of a mining population would soon clear oft' the few scattered bushes in the neighbourhood of the mines. 20. Water would have to be brought from a distance as there is no wate r fit for use in engines near the mines, nor even a supply of drinking water; the few waterholes yield a limited supply of brackish water, which is perforce drunk by the Arabs, in default of better. The nearest source of fresh water 18 !? e Wadi y ^ere appears to be a sufficient supply, but it would have to be pumped a distance of 10, or more probally 12, miles up to the coal-field. 21. The country has already been described as a desert; it is consequently almost unnecessary to say that it produces nothing in the way of provisions and supplies, all of which would have to be imported. 22. The country in which the coal is found is unsettled and inhabited only by lawless tribes. Until some settled government is established, it would be impossible -at any rate imprudent—to sink capital in it, and though the tribal organisation of the Arabs would make it easy to Sandemanise the country, were there any justification for that course being adopted, the ex pense of doing so would have to be added to the other expenses of extracting the coal and bringing it down to the seaboard. 23. From this it will be seen that not only would the cost of working the coa ^ be very high, in this region where everything has to be imported, but a10 very large capital outlay would have to be faced at the outset, before any return could be obtained. In these circumstances it is only a very large supply of exceptional quality which would justify the establishment of a colliery equipped for an outturn sufficient to give a profitable return on the initial expenditure. It will be seen from paragraphs 5 to 16 of this report that the amount of available coal is really ver^ small, and it must consequently be pro nounced of no economic value, in spite of the excellence of the samples brought back by Dr. von Krafft. Whether this quality is maintained in the other exposures and seams can only be known when the samples I have collected have been assayed, but in view of the fact that the main conclusion reached in this report would be unaffected, its submission has not been delayed in order to incorporate the results of these assays. 24. There remains finally for consideration the question whether there may not possibly be other coal seams more continuous than those examined, and this question must be answered in the negative. In the coal-bearing beds the conditions of deposition were evidently such as led to the formation of limited patches, as opposed to extensive seams, of coal, and it is unlikely that both these forms of occurrence should be found in the same district. Besides this I think it unlikely, in view of the interest which has been shown and the inquiries which have been made, that any exposure of a thick seam of coal exists in this region which has not been brought to notice. There are doubtless many exposures of small seams which would be discovered in the course of a prolonged examination, but probably none of workable thickness. 25. The question of the existence of a workable seam of coal need not, however, be left to be answered by inference, as, owing to the barrenness of the country, it can be answered with certainty in the negative. I have men tioned that the surface of the ground is covered with a sheet of fragments of stone, and though this sheet is almost continuous over the more level ground, and very extensive over the hillsides, yet on the slopes it is frequently interrupted and the underlying bare rock is exposed. In this way complete sections of all the rocks composing the hills are seen, and in the clear air of the desert any coal seam of workable thickness would have shown up conspicuously against the light coloured rocks of which the hills are composed. I do not make this statement from inference, but from experience; in the Garo hills, when they had been stripped bare by the earthquake of 1897, I saw the coal seams most distinctly running in black lines along the bare hillsides, which were visible from long distances off, and in Baluchistan, where the general aspect of the country much resembles the part of Arabia I have seen, though it is not quite so barren, all the coal seams found by me in the hills near Quetta were in the first instance detected from a distance of some miles. In the hills south of Sur, in spite of a very careful search of the hillsides, both with and without the aid of binoculars, I could detect no exposures of coal, and may state with certainty that these hills contain no seam of sufficient thickness and extent to be workable.

We accompanied this party to the shore and, after returnimr their visit in due form, walked round the village on a tour of inspection,, followed by the greater part of the population to whom the visit of a Euro pean is not an event to be despised. 'I'he villa?© of Marbat is disappointing. It, consists of about 150 huts and houses, of the latter 33 in number some are of stone. The only two build ings kept in anything like a state of repair are the .Shaikh's housev) 0 house and t^hat, of ^he 'Akid or iiead 'Askari, which latter Is siT.uat.e.d about -J mile to the west of the town on the sea shore., We were not surprised to find that the inhabitants were extre mely poor even for Arabs.

Pishing is carried on bgr the poorer classes, and what little export trade there is is in Frankincense which is brought down from the % Lamhan ranere and exported chiefly to Bombay in dhows which , come from thence with rice, cloth, etc., for sale or exchange» ihe water supply is drawn from walls in the Wadi i^urbat, which coming from the hills to the K.E., reaches the sea at a poinu 1 mile to the W» of the town. This valley is said to contain a wells of good water throughout its course (about 40 miles,^in- habited er^cept by Kura bedouins) and were agreeably surprised A with the quality of that obtained from the wells which supply the town. Malarial fever is said to be prevalent throughout the■VWmBHIHH-r * , L^dbreast. ,, » During ±zs course Timur sue:ges^ed our returning witJn him t,o Muscat, overland, but. as we had no stores or t.ent,s and t.he 'journey would have been a lone; one, we were obliged zo decline for t-he present, occasion.. The later portion of the day was occupied in exploring the coun try west of Ealala* Up to a mile and a half inland where the Lhufar plain may be said to commence, the land is cultivated with cotton, maize, tobacco and sugarcane for the first mile, after which the Uhufar plain comes down to the sea. Two miles from Lalala and bt3.e from the sea is a spring of fresh water from which a stream flows in a zig zag course to the sea with a marshy land on either bams: abounding with wild fowl. Two miles further on is the village of 'Aufead ( 3^^ )* one mile from the sea. This also consists of two quarters about half a mile apart inhabited respectively by the Bait 5adhil and Bait Majfhun sections of the A iiathir. They contain about 6Q houses apiece, but the eastern quarter is almost entirely in ruins, and fifteen houses only are occupied. Wells of excellent water exist here as at all the villages of the Lhufar plain. .ialf a mile Uorth of 'Aukad on a ruined fort was pointed out to us as having up to 4D years ago been the resort of a small band of Jiura bedouins who plundered the neighbourhood at will, until their numbers became so reduced by death that the survivors were compelled to fly -50 the hills.'But of course' said our informant naively 'this was before the establishment of law and order by the Waliikulaiman'V Wednesday Ifcth December. This was the most interesting day of our visit. Starting soon after daybreak with an escort of S African slaves and &amp; Al Xathiris we set off across the plain from Lalala to visit the Eamhan hills. The plain at this point is about seven miles in breadth, it is covered with rough grass which at this time of the year is brown and withered with dearth Qf moisture. Gazelle, a hyena and several foxes, were seen and fired at without success by our escort whose ideas of shoot ing were poor and did not include the use of the back sights of their rifles. Leaching^■v leaching 'Dhe skirt, of t-he hills we ent.erecL the Wadi. cXarziz from the bed of which a broad stream flows out on to the plain during the monsoon. On the present occasion however,,, we pro ceeded up the valley for two miles, to a height of 600 feet before coming across water, and then found a small la^e or pond about 5:0. feet in circumference, the origin of which is a spring gushing out of the rock a quarter of a mile further up and con nected with it- by a small riv^rlet. Here the. Wadi ends in a cul de sac, there are high rocky cliffs on the three sides with deep and broad caves, apparently natural; and some signs of the verdure which is no (Joubt to be found there during the rains. At present the effect is a curious mixture of sandy and rocky desert land and tropical vegetation. At this point we encountered a party of A1 Kathir bedouins of the Ali bin Bidar section watering their cattle and goats► These people professed never to have seen a European and shewed much curiosity in regard to our food, clothes, etc. They were decidedly friendly and communicative asking and answering questions with great readiness. Their language, known as Kurai or Ehihri, is that peculiar to this region; it contains some Arabic words and expressions, but is quite distinct from the patois spoken by the bedouins of Oman and requires further elucidation. A few of them have guns and daggers, but the maiority are armed with a small round metal or wooden shield foot in diameter (which is hollow and used also for a head dress and to carry water), a stick made of some heavy wood resembling teak pointed at both ends, and a long straight sword. The stick is used as an assegai though not thrown in the same way, it turns over once in the air; and the sword and shield are for employment subsequently. Thetmode of salutation in vogue among these people is not the hand shake now common among Arabs, but the old fashioned kiss, twice on the left and onae on the right cheek. Their dress is cloth all of one colour for both sexes, a dark indigo blue; and the women, although not veiled in the ordinary way wear a sort of cowl of the same material. { ), or according to local pronounciation Garziz,7^ mat/erial^ The maiori-oy of the men wear their hair long and gatJier it, into a coil on their heads, not unlike that which was fashionable amone; Inglishwomen some years ago» The women part their hair in the middle and it falls in two plaits over their shoulders. These people are very dark in colour, almost let black» They are fond of smoking, and we saw a stone pipe being passed round like a loving cup* This section of the tribe possess a thousand head of cattle and about the same number of goats^ they feed on the flesh and milk of their animals, and also exchange them for rice, grain, cloth, etc., with the inha bitants of the coast villages. The animals appeared to be in good condition, they are taken down to the plain daily for grazing* On the return journey we noticed the grass huts inhabited by the people just described, and examined the interesting ruins of what was once an aqueduct running along the cliff lining the adi Gaziz. This was evidently built, of the white stone now to be found in the Lalala quarries, and was a very elaborate structure, extending, we were told, from the spring at the Wadi's head to the plain below and thence to A1 Bilad, a total distance of about nine miles. Kb traces sire said to exist now of the continuation beyond the mouth of the Wadi, which is to be regretted. After bidding farewell to jis Jighness the Sultan we returned t.o .j., . L. i .edbreast' at 6 p.m. and she almost immediately weighed anchor. It is hoped that the above information, which is necessarily scanty owing to the short time at disposal, will be amplified on a future occasion. f uestions of produce of the Eamhan hills have either been reported on separately or are dis cussed in the Gazetteer to which some details have been added. It does not seem advisable to reproduce any of that here. / _ Major. M U £ C A T. ~ r Political Agent j.B.M's Consul, 'he 14th January lyO?.

Dear Colonel Oox, l^en we met in Mohaimnerah you suggested the desira- -bility of our group acquiring a Coal Concession over the Province or Sultanate of Oman, and indicated that you would probably have no difficulty in securing the Concession for us on satisfactory terms. Since my return to London I have discussed the matter with my colleagues and as there is a prospect of our being ab).e to utilise Coal in the Persian Gulf for other purposes than in connec- -tion with the Mining Concession Y /e have decided to ask you to kindly | put forward an application on our behalf. In the case of the Mining Concession it was arranged that I the application should be put forward in the name of Mr. Maiihew r Tarbett Fleming on behalf of the Syndicate which was formed to deal with this Concession, and as the Oman Coal Concession would be dealt with by the same Syndicate the application fcr it could be made in the same namej.and should any documents require to be signed in the Gulf in connection with the application a Power of Attorney from Mr, Fleming^either to one of the Consuls, or to Strick Scott &amp; Co,^ Manager.could be sent out. But it would be preferable, ifptOSIAN OU C f limited. 'p, Ml London &amp; Glasgow. Colonel Qox^ Qontd - 2 1D if there is no objection to this, that the application should be made in the name of Strick Scott &amp; Oo • acting on behalf of the Syndicate. For your guidance I enclose draft of a form of Ooncession, based upon the one that was prepared for the Persian Mining Ooncess- -ion, which might, I think, serve for the Oman Concession, In this I have suggested for the Royalty, either 16% on profits, which i5 the rate payable to the Persian Government in respect of the Oil Concession; or 4do per ton, which is about the average rate of Royalty payable on Goal in India. The Government rate of Royalty on Goal in India is only 2%% on valua at pit's mouth, which works i&gt; v out to only about li per ton, but in the case of privately oiranad Goal lands situated in the most accessible districts the average rate is about Ans. 4/- per ton. If you can secure a lower rate - say 2d. per ton - it would be a more suitable figure for a district which is it present quite unproved, and where the conditions for working are so unfavourable as in Arabia. We should also require some Glause relieving us from the obligation to pay Royalities to the Sultan of Oman should he be dispossessed, or his claim to oocure the Royalties ho successfully disputed, by the Turkish Government or any other State, Power or Ruler.p£B SlAN OR c | ■•' MITED - ji London &amp; Glasgow. i Qoiliofiel O ox «, Oo^td &gt; 2 $JsJ.XL If you can secure the Oonoession for us on somewhat the above lines we will at once arrange td send out an Expedition to report upon the possibilities of working the Coal deposits remunera tively, and should the report be favourable take early steps to develope and work the Deposits.

Sir S. Grey concurs in the telegram, draft of which is enclosed in your letter. I am to observe, however, that the report of the Director of the Geologioal Survey of India, dftted December 13th, 1901, copy of which was enclosed in the India Office letter of May 17th, 1902. appears to prove conclusively that the working of these deposits cannot he profitably undertaken, and I am accordingly to suggest that, if the British group who desire to obtain the concession are not already aware of the should be communicated to facts set forth in that psper, it a to them for their confidential information before they have incurred any expense in connexionconnexion with the enterprise.

I have the honour to forwai-d herewith copies of correspondence noted in the margin with reference to the visit of three Madras surveyors to Maskat. 2. I would specially invite attention to the statement of Mr. K. Murthi, the only one of the three whom I have been able to see since their return from the interior. It is very difficult to treat the statement seriously, as it is so vague and Mr. K. Murthi knows little or nothing of the country he traveiled over. His notes are lost and he is unable to submit anything more definite. He has, however, given me some samples of the metals he has found which are being despatched, to you under separate cover. 3. Mr. K. Murthi seems to have suffered from the usual trouble which beset the explorer in Oman. He was not allowed to dig and his escort were chiefly interested in the prospects of discovering gold and silver. I gathered from him that he did not think much of the prospects of the successful working of these minerals with the exception of the corundum. 4. As His Highness has formally applied to us asking whether we wish to take over the working of these mines, the occasion might seem a favourable one for the de-patch of a geologist who would take Shaikh Ibrahim with him and go over the ground followed by these Madrasi gentlemen and submit a regular report giving sufficient detailed information to allow of a definite reply being sent to His Highness's proposal. 5. These three Madrasi gentlemen have, I understand, under the aegis of Ibrahim bin Muhammad bin Jumaa again gone prospecting this time to the Batina. As soon as they return I shall endeavour to get from them a better account of their travels and discoveries. They seem intelligent and enterprising young men and are, I believe, capable of doing much better work than would appear from the present chaotic state of my information about them and their proceedings. 6.1 do not, however, think it advisable to delay any longer the issue of tbis report, but at the same time venture to request that it may only be con sidered an ad interim one.

Hills Sawyer &amp; Co of Meadows Street, Bombay. Further enquiries, however, elicited that they are not actually in the employ, but were at their own request, given permission to canvass for orders for motor cars, machinery, especially electrical, and similar goods which they could sell on such terms as they pleased, returning trade prices to the firm and retaining any profit they could for themselves. They proposed to travel from Maskat to Mohammerah, Basrah, Baghdad and Constantinople and thence to England. They also enquired about Kuwait, but were told their chances of doin^ any business there were small. They have no passports for travel in Turkey and indeed bear no official recommendation of any kind. They were warned against prospecting in the hills of Oman on their own account as they proposed to do at first and that the Consul could not, without consulting higher authority, support any request of theirs to His Highness the Sultan to be permitted to do so. Subsequently, however, they applied themselves to the Palace for permission and were granted an escort, as appears from other enclosures attached. They gave their names as follows : — (1) Mr. K. Murthi, a Telegu Brahman. (2) Mr. Munji Topan, Gujrati. (3) Mr. Bayanker Prativadi, a Tamil Brahman. Description — No. 1 is a tall man and wears spectacles, blood-shot eyes and dark com plexion, wears English clothes and a khaki sola topee. No. 2 a well-built young man, wears a turban with English clothes ; face is pock-marked; fair complexion. No. 3 is slight and thin and rather short, wears a white helmet and English clothes. All three speak English well and fluently. No one of the three has any working knowledge of Arabic. They took a room in the town and proposed to stay for a fortnight. They have been now in Oman nearly three months and talk of making a long stay. They say that they have sent samples of the minerals found by them to England and expect replies from firms who are interested in mining enterprise. Sub-enclosure 2. Statement of 3/r. Murthi. Mr. K. Murthi came to-day and produced various samples of the geological specimens he found in the course of his travels. He states as follows:— 'We went in a boat and reached Bistan. It was about hours' sail down the coast to the East past Sidap which was about a quarter way. We halted at Bistan a day and a half. There was nothing there. He went up a mountain torrent to a hill about 7 or 8 miles away. I think our course was South and slightly 'West. We found nothing in that hill. I was accompanied by an Arab, Shaikh Ibrahim, who knows a smattering of Hindustani. Under his guidance we went to the villages of Qabil and Haboobiya. Our compass broke the first day out and we tried to get another from His Highness, but he could not supply us with another. We were out 23 days altogether and stayed at Qabil for 5 days owing to Mr. Munji's illness and in another place we camped in a river bed and stayed 4 days when I got ill. Thus we did 14 days' travelling and returned to Muttra on the 1st November. I do not think we ever got more than 20 miles away from Maskat. We went out from Maskat, as I have said, South-east and came back to Muttra via Darsait. My notes of the voyage were taken from me by Shubaili. We never did more than 8 miles a day and on some days only 3 and 4. For instance our last march was only from Darsait to Muttra. A negro slave, a mason, called Sawailim and two local guides were always with us, but Shaikh Ibrahim was too old for prospecting in the hills. In our searches I suppose we covered 10 to 12 miles around our camp. He found traces of corundum, lead and manganese. I think the corundum might3 ^ worked at a profit. The manganese would not pay owing to cost of trans port. As for the lead superficially there is a good deal, hut we were not allowed to dig, and so it is difficult to say whether sufficient exists for working at a profit. r K. MUETHI.

In continuation of my letter No. 1616, dated 17th December 1911, on the subject of the visit of three Madras surveyors, I have the honour to report as follows 2. On the 27th December, hearing that these gentlemen had returned, I asked that they should come and see me. Mr. Bayankar, the leader of the partVj came in response to my summons and informed me that the party left Maskat on the 10th December and returned on the 23rd December; that they did not go to the Batina but have been staying in the environs of Sib near His Highness, and for the most part spending their time shooting in the neighbour hood. They did, however, reach Nakhal and received from an Arab Munshi, called Zohar, and from another old Arab who had also been a Mullah in His Highness' employ and is, so Mr. Bayankar thinks, called Khalfan, application for assistance in digging wells. They discovered no new minerals, much less the gold and silver, regarding which, Mr. Bayankar states. His Highness was keenly interested, but they confirmed their previous impressions as to the mineral deposits previously reported. The Arabs, on hearing of Mr. Bayankar's lead discoveries, at once collected samples of the metallic ore he had pointed out and set about trying to smelt the ore, but, as they were unsuccessful in their operations, they came to the conclusion that there was certainly something shmmg in the rock but that it was not lead and would be of no use for the manufacture of bullets. Mr. Bayankar states that, while he has been prospecting, His Highness has been paying the expenses of himself and his party and estimates that his various trips may have cost His Highness about Bs. 1^000 ; the chief items of expenditure have been donkey and coolie hire. Mr. Bayankar declares that he has been very well treated but his companions again suffered from illness. 3. On this occasion, Mr. Bayankar was exceedingly communicative and gave me the following details of his career which will, I trust, enable higher authority to trace the individual with precision and to form an idea of the amount of reliance that can be placed on his statements. I should like to say that he impressed me favourably. j l x x , Mr. Bayankar is a man of 33 years of age. ^ Coimbatore College whicli he left wll ®'. r he 1 was ^ riqoO and e Ves^s Ws been in the export and import business at Madras since 1900, and g lves a ® reference in Madras Mr. P. Tirnmealeachari, B.A., A^ocateoftheHgh Court of Madras. In 1905, he visited Pans for about a fortnight on mmmg business with a Frenchman who paid Ins expenses. ■ p • ' i altogether about a month and visited no towns of importance except Pans [Confidential.] .....Marseilles. He has never been to England. Mr. Bayankar told me that he had recently written to H. Lnheck, Tort, Bombay, whose head office is in London with branches at Antwerp, Paris, Hamburg and Bremen. He has acquainted him with his discoveries and had forwarded samples which however, so Mr. Lubeck informs him, have not reached. He has not received any satisfactory reply from this gentleman and proposes to go and see him, on arrival at Bombay. Mr. Bayankar has had business relations with the following British firms among others: Bidge-Beedle &amp; Co., Glasgow; J. Everett &amp; Co., Liverpool; Antwerp Trading Co.; Anglo-Mysore Manganese Trading Co. With regard to the last named, he informed me that he discovered two new manganese mines in the Mysore State, which he handed over to the Company. This Coni|pafty, he states, is managed by a Miss Dawson, who paid him 5 per cent. Royalty on the product of the mines, sometimes in kind and sometimes in cash, at the option of the Company. Mr. Bayankar tells me that he has had some nine to ten years' experience in corundum and has seen all the Indian corundum workings. He estimates that about five thousand tons has passed through his hands into the world's market at prices varying from Rs. 400 to Es. 3,000, per ton during the last eight to nine years. 4. I was also able to arrive at some idea of what Mr. Bayankar's views and wishes are as regards his own share and profit in the venture under report. He states that, so far, no written communications have passed between himself and His Highness on this subject and I have advised him strongly not to write for the present and that it would be better for any written communications to pass through this Consulate. He would be prepared to start a British Indian Eirm with his own capital for the collection and sale of corundum and he believes that he is in a better position, owing to his knowledge of the trade, to supply the corundum market than other competitors. If it was decided to grant the concession to another Company, he considers that he should be rewarded for his enterprise and skill in the discovery of the metal here with a mining Royalty of 5 per cent, in either kind or sale values. 5. Mr. Bayankar thinks that the prospects in corundum are most rosy. He calculates that the ore could be supplied f. o, b. at Maskat at an outside cost of dollars twenty to thirty per ton, packed and ready for transport. He considers that corundum of this quality should fetch in the market Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 per ton at very low computation and that there are enough surface workings to supply twenty-five thousand tons. As regards manganese, this would be a very speculative venture. It lies a good way from the coast and carriage alone to the coast would cost dollars 25 per ton. He is not in a position to say much about lead, until he is allowed to dig, though he thinks it probable that tin also might be discovered. He has seen indications of soil that is likely to bear garnets but has so far failed to discover any garnets. I understand from him that this is another branch of mining in which he has been specially interested and in which he has done business. 6. In conclusion, I add as items of information that may possibly prove intersting that Mr. Bayankar is staying with his companions for the present in a house opposite the Erench Consul. The house belongs to the well known arms trader Ali Khan whom, however, Mr. Bayankar tells me, he has never seen. He obtained the key from Moolla Ibrahim of His Highness' household and does not know yet what rent he is expected to pay for it, if any. He himself and Mr. K. Murtha are leaving for Bombay in about three^ weeks' time with a view to supplying boring machines for the wells at Nakhal of which mention has already been made in this report Mr. K. Murtha will not return probably. Indications were not wanting that Mr. K. Murtha had not altogether given satisfaction. During their absence, Mr. Manji Topan, the third member of the party, will remain at Maskat. b. u, t , i.— f. D,—24»1 12 44.i No. 407-E.Aj dated Calcutta, the 19th February 1912 (Confidential).
