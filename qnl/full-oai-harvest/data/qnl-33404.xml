The letter concerns the French packet that Jaffer Ali Khan is tasked with acquiring and the Resident's issues with his lack of guidance from the Governor General of Bengal on the matter.One enclosure; letter from Nicholas Hankey Smith to Jaffer Ali Khan, dated 15 March 1808. The Resident explains that although he thinks the sum demanded for the French correspondence recently delivered is unreasonable, as it is only private correspondence, he will consent to the payment on this occasion. The Resident requests that Jaffer Ali Khan be more cautious in such dealings in the future and provides guidance on what material is likely to be valuable to the British.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x00005e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
