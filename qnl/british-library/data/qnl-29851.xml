Your Excellency, I venture most respectfully to lay before Your Excellency my humble petition, hoping that it will be graced with Your Excellency^ sympathetic consideration. 1. That in company with my son,the marriage of whom had been decreed to take place in Zanzibar,! came here in 1935. 2. My pension of Rupees 600 from His Highness’s Govt, at Muscat,had been paid to me here forjsixjflonths in succession, after which period I decided to &amp;ad6pt Zanzibar as my temporary new Home. Without hesitation, I informed His Highness the Sultan of Muscat that I could not return there on purely medical grounds. 3. In Muscat, I had been a victim of various maladies which lamentably rendered me physically weak. A short stay of less than six months in Zanzibar blessed me with miracle. I restored my health and vigour which are being kept on improving admirably. In brief, I feel myself quite a new man with'a new life in a new land. My disappointment had been indescribably when I had learnt that my temporary stay here had inspired His Highness’s Government to curtail my pension. 4. I had communicated with your predecessor on the subject, imploring his representation on my behalf, to His Highness the Sultan. In one of my letters to the Political Agent at Muscat, I had attached a medical certificate with a view to justifying my case. Though the reply to me had, to a considerable degree, nursed by heart with hope of success, yet hitherto no step had been taken to comply with my application. 5. I am sure that it will be amiss to mention here a few names of the members of my family who, notwithstanding the fact that they have their permanent abodes abroad, are still favoured with their pensions from His Highness’s Government at Muscat. Namely:- Seyyid Dhiyab bin P e had .. Paris Seyyid Taymor bin Peisal .. Poona Seyyid Turkiy bin Peisal .. Istanibul 6. I have neither disburdened myself of onerous responsi bility from His Highness’s service nor have I exhibited disloyalty to His Government. On the contrary, my devotion and allegiance to His Throne are very strong and unchangeable. Therefore ''to what ground my exclusion from the category of the three names mentioned above is attributed ? 7. Being a Britisher with sense of justice and a strong desire to see the lamp of Right aflame every where, I place my case in Your Excellency’s hands with confidence that your intervention and assistance in the matter will not only be blessed with His Highness’s approval but will also justify the triumph of justice. 8. His Highness the Sultan may rest assured that the love of my native land has an important place in my heart. My finan cial status has become rather abnormal through sudden disconti nuation of my lawful pension which I enjoyed for a long period while at Muscat and within six months in Zanzibar. In view of this embarrassment, I have determined to return home after the wan 9. I earnestly pray Your Excellency to view the case with sympathy it deserves for I shall ever remain very much grateful. I I beg to remain. Your Excellency, Your obedient servant.

May I ask you to draw the attention of the Govt, of Muscat to the fact that I have overstayed my leave on purely medical grounds and that a doctor’s certificate to that effect was despatched by me to the said Government. 3. May I also ask you to draw their attention again to the fact that Seyyid Th£yab bin Pehd, who is in Prance, is still drawing a monthly pension of Rupees five hundred. If the Government of Muscat find that the granting of pension to Seyyid Th£yab is justifiable, then I feel that my case is equally, if not more, justifiable.

In this connection I am to point out that this statement by the British Consul appears to be at variance with thai made in paragraph 2 of your letter to His Excellency the British Resident of the 21st of January, 1943,to the effect that you are not employed as a Government servant by the Government of Muscat. 3. I am also to enquire, why, in view of the fact that you are prepared to return to Muscat after the war, you are unable to do so now. I I am, etc. Sd. J. J. ADIE for ACTING CHIEF SECRETARY to the GOVT. SEYYID HAMOUD BIN FEISAL, ZANZIBAR.ZANZIBAR, 16th December, 1943• Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge Receipt of your letter dated 11th December 1943 bearing reference No. 2068 (13250.5) and state as follows:- 1. I am uncle of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and so a member of the Royal Family. As such I have been paid what is called in Arabic 'Fazira' for the last 22^ years, since the death of my father Syyed Faisal bin Turkey, except for the last 7i years. The said Fariza has never been paid to me as salary for services rendered. So far I recollect, I had been given temporary jobs on 3 occasions for which I was paid salary over and above the said Fariza as under (a) I served His Highness* Government in 1914 as Governor of Javador temporarily for a period of about l-g- year. I was paid Rs. 500/- per month as salary over and above my Fariza of Rs. 600/- per month. (b) I served temporarily for about 8 months in 1916, as Governor of Barka. I was paid as salary Rs. 400/- per month over and above my Fariza of Rs. 600/- per month. (c) In 1923, as a matter of grace, I took the charge of Matrah as Governor thereof for on e month only. 2. Except the aforesaid temporary services for which I reeeived separate salary over and above my Fariza, I have not done any service, and for all the past 22^ years I received regularly my Fariza every month. 3.. Since I came to Zanzibar in 1935 I have found that Zanzibar climate suits me and I have improved ray health. I therefore do not want to return for the time being to Muscat as its climate does not suit my health. 4. I therefore pray the Government to help me in getting my past Fariza for the last years which has been withhold without any reason whatsoever. I am entitled to Fariza during my life time according to my legal right as a member of the Royal Family. Thanking you in anticipation, I have &amp;tc. SAL S d. SAYYID HAMOUD BIN FEI THE HON.
