B. 140. This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. Aden Boundary. llio &gt; 01 eign Oflico note of 3rd danuary 1903 shows the course of events Pol 2062 03 in the Aden Hinterland up to the end of Matters have, however, since that date developed to a certain extent in regard (1) to the l pper \afiai; (2) the question of military arrangements. I.—Upper Yaffai. The Government of India have from the beginning held the view that the Upper Yaffai and Upper Aulnki are covered by Lord Granville’s declaration of 1S73, and urged that this view should be conveyed to the Turks. (See telegram of 27th November 1901.) The Secretary of State -concurred, but with regard to the definition of the boundary by agreement, said that, if difficulties were raised as to the inclusion of Beda and Behan, this portion of the Protectorate should be excluded from the present discussion (telegram 9th December), and added (17th December) that the Foreign Office also concurred, but-'considered that the number of points reserved should be as limited as possible. As related in the Foreign Office note, matters in the Amiri country Pol. 867/02 Jiaving come to a deadlock, the India Office suggested to the Foreign Office (27th June 1902), that the Commission should be “ directed to proceed with “ the work of delimiting the frontier of the British Protectorate to the “ east of the plateau or highland valley enclosed between the Jebel Jehaf “ range and the hills on the opposite side of the plateau.” The Viceroy was accordingly instructed, with the assent of the Foreign Office, to “direct “ the British Commissioner to invite his Turkish colleagues to proceed with “ the delimitation east of the Amiri plateau up to the desert or other “ boundary of the rest of the Protectorate round Aden.” (Telegram 19th July 1902). The Viceroy in reply said that Colonel AVahab had been called upon for a report as to the respective advantages of proceeuiag N.F. and S.W., and mentioned that a despatch was under issue advocating immediate “ conclusion of protectorate treaties with the Upper Aulaki and Upper “ Y r affai, who have applied for them.” (Telegram 22nd July). This Despatch was received on the 11th August (Secret letter, No. 130, dated Pol. 1079/02. 21th July). It proposed to include in the Protectorate Beda and Behan also. On the loth August it was forwarded to the Foreign Office with a proposal to defer consideration of the question of protectorate treaties until the researches of the Commission had thrown some light upon the position of the tribes in question—and with the suggestion that “ meanwhile a firm stand can be “ taken upon past declarations of the intention of His Majesty’s Government “ to exclude Turkish interference from the possessions of the nine tribes; “ and the Commission in carrying out their duties can be authorised to “ proceed on the assumption that the Aulaki and Yaffai tribes include all “ tribes of those names, whether Upper or Lower.” At this time Sir Nicholas O’Conor, General Maitland and Colonel Maunsell (the Military Attache at Constantinople) were all present in London, and the opportunity was taken for a Conference on the Aden Boundary question at which, in p 0 i 2460/02 addition to these gentlemen, Sir Thomas Sanderson, Sir W. Lee-Warner and / Mr. Maxwell of the Foreign Office w r ere present. No reference to the Yaffai question, however, appears in the memorandum of their proceedings. The Foreign Office replied to our letter of the 15th August on the 25th August, p 0 i. 2516/02* concurring “ in Lord George Hamilton’s proposal for dealing with the question,” adding certain general remarks in regard to the extension of our S. 4. A2 Pol. 2652/02. Pol. 2838/02. Pol. 2849/02. Pol. 1 of 1903. protectorates. The Government of India were instructed accordingly (No. 38, Secret, dated 5th September 1902). . _ , . . ^ Sir N O’Conor, on his return to Constantinople, took an early opportunity of distinctly claiming the YaffaUs one of the nine tribes ; and the Turkish Ministerfor EorcigrT Affairs admitted the claim (Sir N. O’Conor s No. 411, dated 18th September 1902). , u a , On the 1st November the Turkish Government, with the Sultan s per mission. solemnly accepted delimitation '‘' vers le ord-est, cest a dive % vers le desert ” and in his telegram No. 131 of the 18th November, summing up the situation, Sir N. O’Conor says “ It has been agreed with the Turkish “ Government to begin at once delimitating north-eastwards to the desert; “ Yaffai is thus necessarily placed among the nine tribes. . . The question, ii moreover, was decided in our favour when laised some time ago. It appears, then, that (1) the Indian Government have from the first regarded the Yaffai, without distinction of Upper and Lower, as one of the nine tribes to which Lord Granville s warning of 1873 applied; (2) that by the Foreign Office letter of the 25th August llis Majesty’s Government accepted the view of the India Office that for the purposes of the delimitation the Upper Yaffai cannot be separated from the Lower Yaffai and are included in the nine tribes to which the warning of 1873 applied ; (3) that the Turkish Government by agreeing to delimitation in a north-cast direction towards the desert have ipso facto accepted this view. Yet the local Turkish Commissioners have up to the present refused to recognise the Yatfai as one of the nine cantons ; and the British Commissioners have been unable to take any steps to carry out their instructions. The position named Lakhmat-ash-Shub has been selected by Colonel Wahab as a suitable starting point, but before the Commission can proceed thither they must have some assurance of the safety of their communications. Further more, in a telegram of the 16th December, the Resident reported that Colonel Wahab considered that without the goodwill of the Yaffai. it would be impossible for the Commission to go through their country, and advised that they should receive a. subsidy. On the 19th the Secretary of State suggested as an alternative an immediate payment for allowing the Commission to enter their country, but adhered to his decision of the 5th September not to sanction a protectorate for the present. After further consultation with Aden the sum of Us. 10,000 was sanctioned as the amount of the payment; but a further suggestion was made by the Resident (29th December) that the Yaffai should be assured that they are recognised by Government as one of the nine tribes, and that no occupation by the Turks of country proved to be Yaffai will be permitted. While this proposal was still under consideration the Resident reported (4th January) that the Yaffai Chiefs (with one exception) had accepted an invitation to come in to Dthali in a week or 10 days. He thought that they might possibly refuse a cash payment and hold out for a stipend and pro tectorate treaty. He strongly urged that he might be authorised to concede both their conditions, the latter being understood only to cover aggression by foreigners. Failing approval of the latter condition, he suggested that he should be allowed to offer a stipend and treaty of friendship and peace. Sir N. O’Conor having meanwhile (telegram of 26 th December ll J 02, No. 144) reported that he saw no objection, from the point of view of our engagements with the Turks, to a protectorate, His Majesty’s Government decided that it was necessary to conciliate the Yaffai, but undesirable to commit ourselves further than was necessary with that object. The Secretary of State therefore telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 9th January as follows :— See Aden telegrams^ 29/A December and 4/A January^ on the subject of the Tipper Yaffai. The Prime Minister and Lord Lansdowne agree as to the necessity of our securing the friendship of the Upper Yaffai Sheikhs, but until the facts concerning the limits of tribal territory have been ascertained by our Commission, they are unwilling that we should be committed f urther than is necessary. It is, therefore, desirable that President should attempt to gain support oj Sheikhs by offer of money payments, if necessary increasing the limit of Rs. 10,000 mentioned in Resident’s above-quoted telegram of3 29tt December, and that, if this offer ferns, he should, in accordance with his suggestion, propose to conclude with them a treat,, of fJZnff , ht&gt; combined with a stipend. In view of the policy nidi Jedin my lertllZam of to-day s (late, this ought to be sufficient. Protection may however be promised, if found absolutely necessary. But, in the event of this premise being found necessary, it must be given in such guarded terms that it doe Jot commit us to maintain the actual limits of occupation by the tribes if it should be found advisable to adopt some compromise, as the result of the investigations off tne Commission. ^ II.— Military Arrangements. Hie escort which was originally detailed to accompany the British Com mission consisted of about loO men, viz., a company of native infantry, and a few sappers and miners and Aden troop. On the 20th March 1902 the Resident reported that armed parties in Turkish pay were interfering with the surveying and foraging operations of the Commission and that he had strengthened the escort by a half company of native infantry. On the 12th April rumours were prevalent of an intended attack from Tfliz on the British Camp. Colonel Wahab. did not attach much importance to the mm ours, but he asked for some British troops and two mountain guns. The Resident proposed to utilise this opportunity of testing the suitability of the Dthali plateau as a sanatorium by sending up 40 Rritish infantry and 25 gunners with two guns. At the same time he said he was not without anxiety as to the safety of the Commission. The Secretary.of State declined, subject to discretion being left to the Resident to take any steps necessary to secure the safety of the Commission, to allow troops to he moved up pending the result of repre sentations to Turkey. On the ] 2th of May the Resident was again authorised to strengthen the Commission by any troops necessary for its safety and support within the line we claimed. On the 14th May the Resident reported that the Turks had made large encroachments recently, and he doubted whether they could be induced to evacuate without a display of force on our side. The Secretary of State merely repeated his previous instructions. On the 1st June the Resident reported that the Turkish force on the Dthali plateau, exclusive of the Turkish Commissioners’ escort, amounted to 800 men with eight guns, 'ihe Resident pointed out that no troops could now be moved up from Aden for some weeks at least. On the 10th October the Resident reported a suggestion by Colonel Wahab that, in view of the strong pressure being exerted by the Turks on tribes which he held to be subsidiary to the Amir of Dthali, troops should be sent up. The Resident suggested that it might be expedient to undertake preliminary measures by warning some troops in India for service and by authorising equipment to be provided at Aden for a column of 500 men. The Viceroy, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, was instructed to take the necessary measures, if he agreed. His agreement was conveyed in a telegram of the 16th October. On the 10th November the Resident reported a recommendation by Colonel Wahab that, when the movement of the Commission to the North- East took place, a column of 100 men, of whom some should be British, should be stationed at Dthali. This proposal was supported by the Viceroy (24th November). On the 2nd December the Secretary of State authorised the Resident’s proposal being carried out, and the despatch from India to Aden, if necessary, of a battalion of native infantry for reinforcement, but no movement of troops from Aden was to take place without further instructions. On the 9th December the Resident reported that he doubted whether a reinforcement bv one battalion from India would be sufficient, should a display of force be an object distinct from the occupation of Dthali. He thought that at least half a battalion of British infantry, and a native mountain battery should be sent in addition.On the 11th December, the necessary explanations bavin' ^ en given at Constantinople, the Viceroy was instructed to order the Resident to send to Dthali 400 additional troops wirli four guns, as soon after Mr. Fitzmaurice s arrival as he might think expedient; but in the meantime to take do tother steps. Tins force left Aden 2nd January and was due at Dthali on tne LUtn. On the 2nd Januarv the despatch of a native mountain battery from India was authoiised, the‘Aden guns on wheels being reported useless owing to the nature of the country. . . , , . On the 6th January a report from Mr. Fitzmaurice was received, showing the precarious position in which the communications of the British Commission with the South would be placed, when it proceeded to the North-East, by the occupation bv the Turks of Jalela with troops and of other positions with native levies, owing to the hostile attitude assumed by the Turks. His Majesty’s Government accordingly resolved to send further instructions to the Government of India. The Secretary of State accordingly telegraphed Viceroy on the 9th January as follows:— See Aden telegram of 31st December. The Torte has again been pressed by the British Ambassador at Constantinople to send immediate instructions to their Commissioners to meet the British Commission forthwith at Lakhmat-ash-shub, and to proceed with the demarcation of the boundaries of the Tipper Yaffai from that point towards the desert. When the proper moment arrives. O'Conor will be instructed to inform the Borte that if instructions to the above effect are not sent, and are not obeyed by the Turkish Commission, the British Commission will proceed by itself to ascertain the boundaries in question, and that any attempt to interfere with their line of communication will be summarily dealt with ; that, moreover, force will be used to expel Turkish troops or Arab levies from Amiri territory, if any attempt is made by the Turks to re-occupy vacated posts or establish fresh ones in the disputed Amiri territory, or if the Turks or their Arab levies molest the Bi'itish troops in any way. Blease let me know on what date British Commission will be ready to start for Lakhmat-ash-shub and to commence delimitation, if necessary, by itself and in spite of opposition by Turks; also, whether our troops at Dthali are of sufficient strength with reinforcements available from Aden to carry out quickly and effectively the expulsion of Turks from the Amiri territory. This telegram was repeated to the Resident on the 9th January, who replied on the 11th January as follows to the question about the sufficiency of the troops cn the spot:— With reference to your enquiry of the V&gt;th January, the troops at Dthali are of insufficient strength to carry out quickly and effectively the ejectment of Turks from Amiri territory. The Aden garrison is already under strength, and no re-inforcements could be sent from there. To effect desired object, and to keep open communications, a brigade is necessary, including British infantry and British mountain batteries from India. A very con siderable force, in addition to the brigade above mentioned, ivould be necessary if our Commission were to attempt to enter Yaffai territory without the consent of the tribe. Such a contingency icould lead to very serious complications, and is to be strongly deprecated. And on the 14th January the Resident sent further information as follows :— Our column is reported by Wahab to have arrived at Dthali (?). In anticipation of its arrival the Turks have reinforced their Jalela and Kataba garrisons, increasing the former to 500 men with six guns, and the latter to 340 men with two guns. Consequently they now have near Dthali a force considerably superior to ours, especially in guns, as we have only four obsolete 1-pounders against their eight modern breech-loading guns. Wahab draws special attention to the increase of the Turkish forces at Jalela, in territory which is not admitted to be Turkish, the garrison being now largely in excess of what can be considered necessary for the Com missioner s escort. He further reports that 600 Arab levies are being raised by the Turks to hold Jabal Mafare and Jabal Jehaf from all which (sic) their regular troops had been withdrawn.Meanwhile the Secretary of State, on receiviog the llesident’s telegram of the 11th, had telegraphed as follows to the Viceroy on the 13th January: &amp;66 l&amp;Gsidoit s telegram, Wth January. Please let me have your views as to reinforcements required for the Aden delimitation. Whatever immediate preparation for their-despatch may he required should he made in anticipation of my sanction. And in a telegram of the 16th January he communicated to the Viceroy and Aden the terms of a communication made to Sir N. O’Conor by the Sultan J O' Conor reports that he had an audience with the Sultan on IMh instant on the subject of Aden delimitation, at which the latter informed him that Irade had been issued containing following instructions to the Yemen out hoi ities, enact text of which will he sent hy Embassy to Air. Fitzmaurice as soon as possible : --(a) Irregular levies to be disbanded; (b) rights of Amir of Dthali as exercised previous to October 1901 not to be interfered with ; (e) the Ottoman Commissioners to be instructed to recognise Yaffai as one of the nine cantons; (d) the Ottoman Commissioners to be ordered to proceed to Lahnat-as-Shub and delimit the boundary north-eastward to the desert. The instructions, however, actually issued by the Porte to the Turkish Commissioners do not go so far as the Sultan’s version of them. The following telegram was received by the Foreign Office on the 19th January from the Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople, acting for Sir A T . O’Conor, who is now in this country :— (No. 12.) “ Following sent to Fitzmaurice to-day 4 Following translation of extract, “ ‘ communicated to us by Porte in writing, of the decision of Council of ‘ Ministers sanctioned by Sultan’s Irade :— It has been decided to continue work of delimitation towards N.E. up to desert without interfering with actual (group omitted) (?) of Sheikh of Dthali. leaving to an eventual agreement between the two Govern ments the dispute concerning the four points (recently evacuated by Imperial troops) as also with a recognition on our part of the situation of Yaffai among the nine cantons ; to leave to the decision of Ottoman and British Governments the solution of points on which the Com missioners may not be able to agree; and if armed Bashi-bazouks should be found at four places above-mentioned to cause them to withdraw in conformance with above decision. “ ‘ Instructions in the sense of above were telegraphed to Ottoman Commissioner on 16th or 17th January.' ” On the 20th January the following telegram was received from the Viceroy in reply to the Secretary of State’s telegrams of the 13th and 16th :— P.— Your telegrams of Y&amp;th and 16 ^ January asking our views on the Aden Delimitation question. We do not regard situation as permanently (/') ameliorated by the issue of the recent Irade, as in the past Turkish assurances have so often been deceptive. At present juncture we wish to submit to His Majesty's Government an urgent representation of the views which we have expressed on the main question. For more than a year, by procrastination and subterfuge, the Turkish Government have encroached on the amiability of the British Government; while the Turks on the spot have acted as if completely independent of their Government, ignoring whatever assurances the Sultan has given, inventing frivolous charges against the British Com missioners, insulting and firing upon the British party,—the culminating incident being the stabbing of a British officer—and doing all in their power to prejudge the question and to diminish British prestige with the local tribes. When the Commssion proceeds to .Lakmat ash-Shu’) to demarcate the boundary north-eastwards, the tactics already described will probably only be transferred to another locality, and meanwhile the problem of Dthali will remain unsolved. I understand the view of His Majesty's Government to be, first, that Turkish levies and troops should be withdrawn from the four posts6 of Jebel Jihaft Mafcne, L a kma t - as-Sa la h , and Jebel Shah ad; but, secondly, that Jalela, Lakm'at-al-Ilajfar (?), Jalas, and Wabh should be allowed to remain in military occupation of the Turks; and, thirdly, that the discussion of the Amiri boundary should be deferred to some future date and settled in London or Constantinople. As to this policy we desire to represent that it involves immediate danger, since it will leave in Turkish hands the communications of our party on the North- East boundary, and that there is no likelihood of its ever leading to a peaceful settlement of the Amiri question. The discussion will be spun out for years, during which we shall be keeping our troops on the spot at great expense, and the perpetual strain will be sapping the loyalty of the Amir of Bthali and of the local tribes. H e urge Ilis Majesty*s Government to realise that the matter cannot be disposed' of by half measures. Every representation we have hitherto made has been endorsed by Mr. Fitzmaurice s report ; and our strong recommendation is that we should use the present opportunity to settle the main question and not merely minor and petty issues. There will be no peace on Dthali border whilst the Turkish occupation continues south of Kataba. The blue line on JVahab's map of 2nd December is supported by powerful arguments and strongly advocated by Mr. Fitzmaurice; and it seems to us that we are now justified by the persistent bad faith of the Turkish Government in demanding its acceptance as the frontier. IFe think, moreover, that the conduct of the Turks on the spot has been so intolerable during the past year that serious reparation is due to us. As the Forte is quite aware, it will be impossible in a Jew months’ time for troops to move in the disputed territory. If definite measures are not taken, controversy will only be put off till next cold weather, and two years will have been wholly wasted. Whatever decision may be eventually arrived at as to the apportion ment of the expense of the delimitation proceedings, it seems to us to be inequitable that a continuance of tactics of delay should involve the Indian taxpayer in a risk of further burdens. We think that it would be wise, should Ilis Majesty's Government agree with our views, to despatch at once from India two battalions of Native infantry and a second mountain battery, and to retain for the present at Aden the Dublin Regiment, which is due to leave next month. To supplement this show of force, or as a substitute for it, a naval demonstration at Hodeida might be made. We emphatically urge that the political pivot of the whole question is the Dthali plateau, and that any settlement which leaves its future in protracted doubt will be valueless. C. G. C.
