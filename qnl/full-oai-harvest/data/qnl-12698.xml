The entries are dated 3 October 1723 to 15 April 1725, and record the journey of the ship from England to Mocha and Bombay and back again to England.The journal records the ship’s departure from Deptford and arrival at Gravesend on 3 October 1723, and the ship passing the Lizard on 20 November 1723. The entries also record the ship anchoring at the following places: Table Bay (27 February to 16 March 1723/24); Mocha (7 May 1724 to 15 July 1724); Bombay Harbour (3 September to 15 September 1724); St Hellena [St Helena] (13 to 23 December 1724). The journal also records the ship’s arrival at Plymouth on 25 March 1725. (Both Old Style and New Style dates are given.)Journal entries for each day when the ship was at sail (past the Lizard) contain tables recording information including: hours of the day (H), knots (K), fathoms (F), wind direction, the number of miles sailed each day, and navigational information relating to latitude and longitude.The entries also include comments, mostly about the following: the direction of the wind and other comments about the weather; the course of the ship; adjustments to the sails and other actions performed on board the ship; and sightings of other ships, land, and birds.The ship was at anchor at Mocha for longer than the other places at which it anchored, and entries for when the ship was at Mocha also mention chests of treasure, iron, steel, and elephants’ teeth being unloaded from the ship and brought ashore, and bales of coffee being received on board the ship.There is a note on folio 2 of the volume stating that the journal was received on 12 May 1725.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>London</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Mocha</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ships</topic></subject><subject><topic>Voyages and travels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Marine navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Weather</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001513.0x000030#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
