Spinning master recently obtained in India for Kerman is being paid rupees 1,000 per mensem although survey of cotton industry has still to be made operative - this new plant must be encouraged.

I hardly think we can do this until the Persian cotton industry has been surveyed as a whole and we have the recommendations of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and their expert advisers. As there is new reason to hope that the survey may take place fairly scon, I think it To make out a satisfactory case for the report. I am sending, a copy of this letter to J who will no doubt see that the United Kingdom Commercial corporation have this particular ques in mind when the survey is made. would be best to wait until we have the surveyors* report.

HCLborn 8404 11th February, *1942 Dear Glutton, I have received e letter from Messrs. S. Dodd &amp; Sons Ltd. of Oldham about an order which they say they have received from Mr. Y.L. Khonji, a cotton spinner of Bunder Abbas, Iran, for a small cotton v/aste spinning plant. It appears that this matter was raised first in January, 1940 and Mr. Khonji also asked Messrs. Dodd to find him a suitable man capable of managing the mill after the plant had been set up. Apparently a Mr. Poland Sidebottom, then living in Bournemouth was chosen for this position, but there was some hitch-up over the shipping of the plant. Consequently, Mr. Sidebottom’s departure for Iran was postponed and now that all is ready for him we find that he is employed in one of the R.O.Fs in this country. I understand that M. Sidebottom is prepared to take the position in Iran if an exit permit is granted to him and he is permitted to leave his employment in the R.0.F. I am, of course, discussing the matter with the Ministry of Supply, but I think I should ask if the Foreign Office have any views about the particular job to which Messrs. Dodd refer and about the desirability of sending British technical labour there. y If the job is considered to be one of serious importance it seems to me that Mr. Sidebottom should be released, as he is fully qualified for this type of work, is conversant with the Near and Middle East and has been associated with the cotton spinning trade for several years. I should be grateful for any information you are able to give me. Yours sincerely (Sgd) Paul I-L Brind G. L. Glutton Esq., Foreign Office, S.W. 1.CCFY Messrs. S. Doid * Sons Ltd. l.v/ed/md. Paul H.

We thank you for your letter of the 25th Februaiyr with regard to the appointment of Mr. Poland fide bottom as Manager of a Mill for Mr. Khonji, Cotton Spinner, Bunder Abbas, Iran, and we note your request for information as to what qualifications should be possessed by a man required for this appointment. In reply we would inform you that the individual concerned should be possessed of as full knowledge as possible of Textile Machinery, ~1 ^ i ? case for Opening and Cleaning cottons, the spinning coarse , an ? medium counts; and he should also have' knowledge of Condenser spinning, of coarse Engine waste yam and the weaving of came. . . i * not alwa &gt; s Possible to find an individual with experience 0t h*.! 1 °3t S8e8 &gt; but in thb instance Mr. Sidebottom has the necessary qualificationg. It is also important that he should have experience of erecting machinery and supervise the working of it and it would be an added advantage if he had experience of actual mill work both at ' home ana abroad, and the supervision of labour overseas. The owner of the mill will probably require the man to deal with a certain amount of the commercial part of the Company’s affairs and with a knowledge of costing. »e think these are the main points on which you require informatior and from our knowledge of Mr. Sidebottom we think he would fill the post moat satisfactorily. - will,^of course, appreciate the importance of haviitf an ^mglishman employed by the Company, which is in native Iranian hands fr om the Point of view of future Export orders Sr this country.
