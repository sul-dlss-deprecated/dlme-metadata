Snouck Hurgonje, in the second volume of his publication
                           Mekkadescribes the place, as well as the festival of ‘Sittanā Mèjmūnah’ in detail.Much of the foreground and middle ground is littered with tents of varying shapes and sizes. Several low-lying hills are evident in the background, while a pathway snaking from left through the centre into the distance is described as ‘the way to Mecca’ in the title.Tradition relates that she requested to be buried at this location, where she married Mohammed.This photograph is described as a ‘third view’, however, it does not appear to have been taken from the same vantage point as the two previous photographs.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘IXa’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
