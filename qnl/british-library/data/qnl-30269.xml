The question of these brief telegraphic reports regarding the trend of public opinion on the war, has been lately under consideration; and it has been agreed that they are too valuable to be dropped. The suggestion which is being put forward to other posts in the Midole East is that where there is no par ticular item of interest to report in connection with puolic opinion on the war, the telegram might communicate in brief tne topics, local or otherwise, regarding which public opinion is concerned. Certain posts have adopted this plan on their own initiative; and v/e have been struck oy tne practical value of tne information thus furnished, /ery often it is at least as important to know the kind of topics which interest the public - even if these are un connected with the war - as it is to know the particular items of war news v/hich have aroused the greatest interest.

Dated 3rd January 1940. flame and Date Letter flo*C/8Ti-l a/50, dated the 28th December, 1939, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, with enclosure. Feeling in Bahrein about the war* 'The Agency, D.O.Ho,0/871-1 •e/50 Behrein, the 88th December 1939. A short time ego two members of my office, who ere inetrooted to report weekly to me on feeling in Behrein ebout the wer eo fer es they etm pick up impressions in the bsssar, reported that M enlightened people ere in favour of the demoereeles while the semi-educeted end non-eduoated who constitute the majority ere in favour of Germany*. It seemed to me from my own obeervatione that this wee the very ant1theele of the truth, so I asked Belgreve to give me hie impressions. I enclose herewith e copy of e letter which X heve now received from him. 2. 1 am convinced that he is right ebout the loyal sentiments of the Bahama and the lowsr class Arabs in general. His remarks about the so-called educated townsmen give perhaps a rather exaggerated impression of pro-German sentiments, though this impression la corrected in the final paragraph of hla letter. X should myself aay that real pro-German feeling le almost non-existent, though there are quite a lot ol theee Holla who would be pleeaed to hear of British reverses. This however is probably true of the whole East. A dominant power can never be popular with all clasaee, especially with those classes who see their opportunities lor eelf-ag randleement limited. Fortunately this particular class in Bahrein lias little capacity for doing ham. 3. Bclgrave’s remarks about the relative merits of the London and Berlin Arabic brosdea*ts are interesting. 1 ortunstely for us Berlin cannot avoid broadcasting the most stupid and palpable lies; if they did - probably few people would listen to London at all. Nevertheless Berlin will continue to be the more popular until London realises that Arabic broadcasts must be whet the Arabs want and not what London thinks they ought to want. And London's failure to put on a aecond Arabic ne e broadcast does little to support our propagenda about our superiority over Germany in wealth, resources of all kinds, and technical ability. fours sincerely, (8d.) H.ftel htman. The Hon'ble Lt.Col.C.G.Prior, C.l.£&lt;. Polltics1 Heeldent in the Persian Gulf, Buehlre.Confidential Bahrain^ December 27 &gt; 1939 Dear i elghtman, Boaietitn# ago you a ant rne a note purporting to be an opinion on local feeling about the war. 1 entirely disagree with the writer*a vlewa. 2. The majority of the population in Bahrein consists oi the Bahama (Shia aboriginal® and the Arab direr class „ all oi who»n are illiterate and not in the habit of reading pa;,if re or listening in to the wireless. These people are more or leei inarticulate and at present they are contented, not much interested in the war —— because they know and understand 00 little about it and are pro-Britieh almost from habit. The Bahama, eapacially the older men, are grateful to the British for having relieved them from the oppression of the Khalifeh, which they never forget, and the diver olaea Arabs are aatisfiad with their government which they are apt to regard, vaguely, as having some connection with the British, becaure they are at present more prosperous than they used to be owing to employment in the oil field and in public worha. 2 can state definitely that thic class la pro-Britlah and wishes Britain to win the war. I ace no reason for changing their outlooic unless the war effects their lives detrimentally, by causing L reat increase in cost of living or unemployment. Personally 1 do not think there la *ny political advantage to be gained by propaganda anong this class or by teaching then about the war. In any case the illiterate Ar»sbe and the Bahama do not provide a fertile field for propaganda. 3. The other class cons Iste of educated townsmen in Manamah and uharraq including the Khalifah, Mercian* , Holla and foreigners. They have no sympathy with the country people (the Bahama) and little sympathy with the Arab diver class though la the past the townspeople have frequently tried to stir the others into taking part in local political disturbances, usually without success. It la among this class that there is definite anti-British feeling which la partly nationalistic and partly directed against the Ruling Family. These people are educated to a certain degreet many of them have travelled and they readily absorb propaganda fron newspapers and from the wlrelees broadcasts and from Individual agitators. The voclferoua element among them la the student type cons let in,; of young men educated in the Bahrein schools and abroad, in Syria and Iraq, but they are supported and encouraged by some older men, local merchants and traders, who are often anti-British because they have personal rearone for disliking the present regime. The youn*; men belong to clubs, they hold meetings, sometimes in the houses of Important merchants and they listen in eagerly to Arabic propaganda from Berlin. 4. The mo 1 t obnoxious of the intelligentsia are the young Holla, Hunnia of Persian origin, who have lived for two or three generations in Bahrein* 'ost of the merchants in Uanamah and 4uharraq are Holla; the reel Arab©, with the exception of a few families, are very poor and therefore, because Manamah and Muharreq are essentially commercialCixamaaities, the real Arab* have little influence. It ie oiuy the Anal if ah who regard the re?il Arebii such as the Sln-Ali, the Aaim, and the Je^ahma \ etc* ati being superior to the Holle owing to tribal friendship in the past. The dolls are not anti-British because they are pro-v’ersien. * ith a few exception they ere asharned of their Persian a.stecectonta and they try to be more Arab than the Arabs. 1 thinx their lack of background gives them an inferiority complex; in most cases they were descended from waier carriers and petty trader? ana hawkers who came to Bahrain with a fe* rupees in their pockets. The Arabs never forget this and the /dialifsh still more regard for a dirty tribal Arab from one of the known tribes than a prot perous Holi merchant. 5. The anti-British feeling in the care of the war is not outwardly visible,, it c insists of talks in clubs a d certain coffee shops and privnte houses. Buccesees announced on the dermtm wireless are welcome? and ne ;s of them ie spread anon the youn ffien who profess pro-German aentinentp. )Ugh 1 h&amp;ve informatioa t'rrn various sources it is difficult to understand what these people really feel on the iin stioru it seems that few if any of them really wiah for German domination in the last but from what I heer it appears that they ouid be glad if British power and prestife was weakened because they think that in that case there would be less of what they regard as interference by the British in Arab countries. I do not anticipate ^ny 1 &gt;r ; of anti-Britisn demonstration in Bfhriih* the youn. en *ho are verbally anti-^ritiah are a very email proportion of the people of *ianamah and Muharraq and they say themselves that they will not 'do ' anything M at present'. 6. The reaction to the Russian attack on Finland ie intaraatin . The people la Bahrain arc unitedly against the Hues Ians. ftot even the would-be pro-Ge i’mene hare e word to sey in f: vour of Rut sia and the Harrians are especially inimical towards Russia. Although most people have never previously heard of Finland yet their sympathy is with the Finns. It is possible that if i ussia had out out propaganda in Arabic she might have roused some sympathy among Arnbs. 7. The daman Arabic wireless propaganda is still more popular among the general public than the ^oa&amp;on broadcast. The reception is more satisfactory, the time is convenient, there is more criticism which ie considered more interesting than bare news, the oratory is impressive and the talk is more amusing then the dignified announcenenta from London. The Arabs enjoy hearing Winston Churchill described es the W.C. and Belieha as Harb-al leha and remarks such as 'Britain will fight to the last Frenchman' are appreciated even by those who are strongly pro-Britieh. I do not wish to exaggerate or to minimise the pro-German feeling in Bahrain. It undoubtedly exists, but it is confined to b sraull number of pereons, mostly youths,* to say that the majority are in favour of Germany is ridiculous. foura sincerely (Ld.) C.B.Beigrare.

Can you do anything to help? Suggest that whenever Reuters cable tonnage sunk during week or month, they also cable total tonnage of Merchant fleet or tonnage entering and leaving British ports during the same period or something of this kind. Same criticism applies to British Broadcasting Corporation. Suggest that British Broadcasting Corporation whenever they announce loss of ships in Empire transmission, finish up with the announcement of total British merchant tonnage or with some kind of slogan such as, 'For every ton sunk so many tons come safe to port'.

German propaganda -Snamy propaganda is of three kinds, through speeches, in lie press and in broadcasts, There is much speaking which is in effect propaganda on behalf of the enemy, but it le not as far as m are aware inspired. The effect is of course bad, Enemy propaganda in the press is negligible sine© rounding up of Germans agents German broadcasts in English are hoard in India on 19 metres wav e-band at 17-30, 19-30, and 21-30 (Indian standard time). Intelligent listeners describe their propaganda value as negligible, since tone is (? hysterical) and they do not carry convict ion, Ar. the same time because they are vigorous and scurrilous they are listened to and give circulation go false- news and rumours. If contradiction is to be issued this should be done in he next following bulktin, preferably without ir-ntiovv ng that eoixrce of rumour la German wireless, since this only servee to advertise German bulletins,- German bulletins in Hindu-Gani arv ir.usgular. They have been noticed be tween 17-30 and 19-30 (Irvlian standard time). Estimates of their frequency vary ■ &lt; ertainly not more than twice a week and possibly less,. They have a novelty 'alue but are poor products and their propaganda value is very little. All India Radio tries to arrange~ 2 attractive alternative programmes at times when O-ermany is broadcasting for India, Hi.tt3.-e has been little of what may be described as direct Briuish propaganda done here. All-India^Radio broadcasts news lour times daily in Hindustani and also in most other important indian languages, Broadcast and press together have succeeded in getting Orest Britain’s motives for entering the war understood. .inare is of course room for much improvement in our arrangements for uar publicity and for counter pripaganda and we are engaged on a fu Q examination 03 ? the problemc the proposal for British Broadcasting Corporation to broadcast in Hindustani, provisional view is unfavourable for foil owl ng reasons, -•.* All Rain o g.we full news service and British Bi oadcasting Corporation bulistins will be apt to be stamped an propaganda from beginning* 2a Peo P le wiil r.ot tune into British Broadcasting Corporation only for war news which they can get from Indian stations* British broadcasting Corporation cannot brighten their bulletin by i nt ro due i ng Ind i an news. Bo News from British Broadcasting Corporation will generally be nc fresher than news from Indian stations so people will not trouble to tune in to it., 4o lf the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts in Hindustani, we shall be asked why not other Indian languages? Generally speaking I&gt;elhi can do all that the Br&amp;ish Broadcasiing Corporation Hindustani broadcasts could do and do it more effectively* It Is to be remembered that people will not bother to tune in to a short wave station when they get a local station much more easily and more clearly*A VJ . .

Also discussed are the following: the impact of British, German, and Italian broadcasts; fears of Russian aggression among the official classes in Afghanistan; the British Broadcasting Corporation's (BBC) approach to reporting British naval losses early on in the war; the extent of anti-British feeling among the various classes in Bahrain; the Italian bombing of Bahrain in October 1940; food shortages in the Persian Gulf.There are no reports from Kabul dating from after September 1940. The reports from the Political Resident continue until April 1945, but they become more and more brief from 1941 onwards, and during the final three years of the war consist of no more than a couple of lines.Other notable correspondents besides the Political Resident and the Minister in Kabul include representatives of the British Broadcasting Corporation and officials of the Ministry of Information, the India Office, and the Government of India.The file includes three dividers which give the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence (folios 2-4).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Information</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Broadcasting Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public opinion</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00005f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
