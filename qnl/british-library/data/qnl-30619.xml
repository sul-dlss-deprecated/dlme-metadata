Sir, tfitn reference to your telegram No.R-31 dated 19.7.27, i have the honour to report that the Imperial Airways Plying boat Satyrus arrived here on 29 . 7.37 at 01.15 hours (I.S.T.), refuelled and flew to Karachi a. about 02.15 hours the same day. I accompanied by hr. Pengelly and the representative of the A.I.O.C. went and met the boat.

Camp 01‘fice, Ziarat, No # H-6o/56. 6 th August 1957, Subject i- Use ol Qwadur anchorage by Inver.! *! Air:,ays Flying Boats,. Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No.744 dated 16th July 1957, fc. Government of India telegram No,1596 of July l4th was received by me on my arrival at Ziarat on the i 6 th July, I could see no mention of the Flying Boat 'Satyrus” being included In th© authorisation forwarded to you with ay express letter No,C-85/58 of June Z4th as the Government of India telegram quoted above mention ed its name but not its registration marks and number and described the machine simply as an aeroplane. Under these circumstances as the matter was urgent I took advantage of the fact that the Cultan happened to be present in Ziarat and obtained from him written permission for the flight vide my telegram No.R- 20 0 f i 6 th July 1957. This permission was contained in &amp; Demi-official letter received on the 16th July which the Sultan lias followed up by an official letter which is dated 16th July at Ziarat but was actually written by him from Kashmere and received by me on the £9th July. A copy of my letter to the Saltan and of his reply there to is attached herewith.- 2 - &amp; © It will be seen fron* the Sultan f s letter tnat ^hile according permission xor the special flignt of n Satyrus |t he asks to be informed whether it is a seaplane or a landplane. If the former he declares that in hj.s opinion such machines are not covered by the terms of the Etuscat Civil Air Agreement. It is true that tne special authorisation signed by the Suitan referred to in paragraph 2 above includes apparently a number of Flying Boats but the Sultan would no doubt reply that he was not aware at the time of this fact, as there was nothing to indicate from the marks and registration numbers given in the list what type of aircraft they were. 4, I can see nothing in the ’jtuscat Civil A ir Agreement regarding the use by Flying Boats or Sea Planes of Gwadur territorial waters and I suppose therefore that strictly speaking the Sultan is correct in his statement. It seemfe to me, however, that it is really a question of technicality, When the Citil Air A greement was drawn up in IS’:4 there was probably no idea of employing Flying Boats on the Sap ire Air Route. Had there been any likelihood of this and the use of Gwadur anchorages had been inserted in the Air Agreement the Sultan would, I think, not have demurred. - * s 5, I think that it is the Sultan/intention — unless it can be shown him that the present Civij. Air Agreement covers Flying Boats which as I have stated above I cannot see that it does in so many words — to demand extra payment for the use of Gwadur anchorages by such aircraft. 2 he offer of £. 1 , 000 /- per annum made by the Air Ministry for the increased services of the Imoerial/iHjririkl, Airways and accepted by the Sultan for the period of th# present Agreement la, I consider, a generous one in view of the fact that a piece of uo-jft wact^ l^nd as an aerodrome without catny other foOllitieft Is all thac is given in return. Shouid the Sultan demand e^tr* payment for Flying Boate I thimc he mignt uv answered that the Civil ^ir Agreement was meant to cover both land ana sea aireraft and tnat, as the latter would be Glaring use at an open roadstead and not of a harbour or Thich any work had been aone or expenditure been incurred by ^ne Muscat State, ths use of dvauur waters as an anchorage might with equity b* included in tnose air iabilities ior which he is to receive the sul* of £ ♦ i , 00 u/~ r annuci. 6 . Fubject to y^ur approval I propose now to rap-iy to the Bui tan that the Satyr us 11 is a flying loai a no. UiaJ. the question of whether the Civil Air Agre«^ant covers the use of such Aircraft has been referred to you for a ruling rhich will be communi cate 1 to in uue course.

Sir, With relerence to the corresponcence resting with your letter No.c/132 of 6th May, 1937, 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward a copy of Air Ministry letter No.8.32956/iIl/A.B.C.0.1., and to request that if you see no objection you should take action on the lines suggested in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the letter. The map referred to in paragraph 3 of the Air Ministry letter is enclosed in original and may kindly be returned in due course. With reference to paragraph 6 of the Air Ministry letter, the Secretary of State would be glad to have your views as to whether it is desirable to approach the Sheikh of Muscat at the present time as suggested. ^e would also be glad to know how the negotiations proposed in India Office telegram No.1242 of 16th April, 1937, are progressing. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Government of India and the Political Agents at Muscat and Bahrein. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (34.) J. C. WALTON.

I. 24th July, 1937. \ r Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for Air to refer to the correspondence ending with India Office letter of the 18th May, No.P.Z.3182/1937, on the subject of the revision of the Bahrein Civil Air Agreement. r\ 'rs 2. As the Secretary of State for India is aware, steps are being taken to define the area of the Civil Aerodrome at Muharraq. A map showing, in detail, the boundaries of the aerodrome will be furnished as soon as it is available. 3. In the meantime, it seems desirable that the formal consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein should be obtained to the operation of Imperial Airways’ contemplated flying- boat services via Bahrein with landings on the water near Manama. In this connection, I am to enclose a map indicating the location of the proposed flying-boat base and alighting area. 4. The use of an alighting area on the water near Manama will entail a revision of the '’^ir Navigation Ptegulations for Civil Aircraft for the Territory of Bahrein, and Conditions governing the use of the Aerodrome at Muharraq approved by His Excellency the Sheikh Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah, C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrein” which permit of landings by aircraft at Muharraq only. The amendments necessary would seem to be as follows:- (a) Section I .- The Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft. (i) Paragraph 4. Delete the words 'Aerodrome at Muharraq' and substitute the words 'the land aerodrome at Muharraq, or the water aerodrome at Manama.' (ii) Paragraph 11. Delete the words 'Muharraq Aerodrome' and substitute the words 'the Aerodromes at Muharraq and Manama.' (b) Section II - Conditions governing the use _of the Aerodrome at Muharraq. (i) Cross heading - Delete the words 'Aerodrome at Muharraq' and substitute the words 'Aerodrome at Muharraq and Manama.' (ii) Paragraph 1. Dekfce the words 'Muharraq Aerodrome' and substitute the words 'The Aerodromes at Muharraq and Manama.' (c) Appendix . 'Form of Special Authorisation for aircraft to land in Muharraq and fly over Bahrein.' The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, London, S.¥.l. (0/«♦ Jf IS ! © 2 . (i) Cross heading - After the word 'Huharraq' insert the words 'or Manama.' (ii) Paragraph 2 (ii) - After the word 'Muharraq' insert the words 'in the case of landplanes, or the aerodrome at Manama in the case of seaplanes.' 5. I am now to ask that, subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland, the Political resident in the Persian Gulf may be instructed to approach the Sheikh wi^n a view to obtaining his formal consent to the operation of Imperial Airways’ flying-boat services via Bahrein, ana approval of the amendment of the local Air Navigation Regulations. 6. Lord Swinton would suggest that the Marquess of Zetland may also wish to consider whether any approacn to :he Sultan of Muscat and Oman is.desirable with reference ;o the proposed operation of flying-boat services o ve r _is territories with landings at Gwadar. No amendment o•.^ Local air navigation regulations seems to be required if the berm 'Gwadar Aerodrome' can be interpreted as including flying boat bases as well as the land aerodrome. 7. Lord Swinton would propose that the detailed arrangements for facilities for the flying boat at Manama and Gwadar should be left for settlanenu locally, fe is given to understand that Imperial Airways have already made the necessary arrangements there m respect of the preliminary survey flights.

It is regretted, that so much delay has occurred since you wrote, but it has been necessary to refer tne matter to our overseas offices, and in some cases even now the information is incomplete. Xn regard to your first query, we are informed tnat Customs duty was paid on importation of the tents used as passenger accommodation at Gwanar. me petrol pump, however, is the property of our Fuel Suppliers and we understand that they also are called upon to pay duty on equipment imported into Gv/adur.

Dear Burkett, Would you kindly refer to Ayton's letter of the 13th January (No- 571849/36/C. 0.1) on the subject of the exemption from Customs Duty of equipment for marine aircraft imported into Gwadur for use in connection with the Empire Air Mail Service? As you 'will see from the enclosed extract 1 rom a / Note of a discussion held at Delhi on 17th November between the Sultan of Muscat and Sir Aubrey Metcalle, His Highness feels a sense of grievance in regard to this matter and without waiting for his further representations we have been looking into the question at at this end. So far as we can make out the position appears to be as follows. When the question of negotiating a Civil Air Agreement with the Sultan was first broached Kis Highness offered, of his own accord, (see Bushire Express Letter Ho. 842-3 of 2nd September 1934 - a copy of which was sent to/ , Burkett, Esq., O.B. S. , M* C. , Department of Civil Aviation, Air Ministry, ' Ariel House, W.C.2.to the Air Ministry under cover of our Printed Letter No.P, Z.5737/34 of the 10th September 1934) to continue to exempt from payment of customs duty, petrol, oil and stores imported for the use of the Royal Air Force and this offer was subsequently embodied in an Exchange of Notes; out in maxing this offer the Sultan indicated that he v/ished to impose duty on petrol, oil and stores imported for the use o- Imper oai Airways. He was, however, persuaded (as a result of the representations in Air Ministry letter No. S, 32956 (D.D.C.A. of the 12th October 1934) to exempt petrol and oil from duty (by the drawback system) and he also agreed that 'Aircraft and spare parts therefor, aero engines ana spare Darts therefor, which are required for emergency repairs” should not be liable for duty. These concessions are embodied in Article 15 of the Civil Air Agreement. But it seems fairly clear that His Highness reserved the right, to claim duty on ”general stores” imported by Imperial Airways and it would appear from the enclosure to Ayton s letter oi the 13th January that the Company have in fact paid duty on general stores (furniture, refrigerators, paint etc.) In such circumstances it seems to us diificult to claim that, as suggested in your letter/letter ol equipment with the existing the views: Takj in regarc his terrj for the I at the pi on a poir if the Aj Political authoritj in Articl may he cc imported I si time to n Sultan wt emphasise rather a strictly to us areletter of the 15th September, the exemption of 'marine equipment' imported by Imperial Airways in connection with the Empire Air Mail Service is within the spirit of the existing agreement, and you will see from the enclosure the views that the Sultan himself holds. Taking into account the Sultan’s friendly co-operation in regard to the establishment of Air facilities within his territories (especially in the matter of facilities for the Royal Air Force) we think that it would be unwise, at the present juncture, to press the Sultan to give v/ay on a point on which he feels a sense of grievance and if the Air Ministry agree we should like to instruct the Political Resident, if he concurs, to tell the Sultanate authorities that, subject to the exceptiona specified in Article 15 of the Civil Air Agreement, customs duty may be collected on all stores (including marine equipment) imported into Gwadur for the use of Imperial Airways Limited. I should add that it is very desirable at the present time to maintain and improve our good relations with the Sultan who has shown some signs of a disposition to emphasise his independence vis-a-vis Foreign Powers to rather a disquieting extent (though not more than he is strictly entitled to do, so far as his written obligations to us are concerned). It is therefore on general political/politica any cans&amp; * 4* political gro-ands advisable to avoid, so far as we can, any causes of friction with him on relatively minor matters. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J. P. GIBSONp. Z. 411/38.

( 7 ) Exemption from duty of Air Mi nistry appara 011 s at Gwadur. The Sultan complained that various aircraft apparatus was being sent to Gwadur on which customs duty, it was claimed, was not payable since it was the property of the Air Ministry. The articles consisting chiefly of motor launches, buoys, anchors, searchlights e^c., and other apparatus required for the use of aircraft were used almost exclusively by Imperial Airways, and as this was a commercial company he aid not see vaiy these articles should be exempted from customs duty. The relevant clause of the Civil Air Agreement, the Sultan pointed out, made no mention of Air Ministry apparatus being exempt, but only that of the Royal Air Force and though he had been informed that these departments were one and the same he interpreted this clause as applying to articles for the exclusive use of the Royal Air Force. 0k Secretary said it appeared rrima facie that the Sultan had some cause for complaint, and suggested that the Sultan should write in to the Political Agent who would forward the representation to the proper authority.b . vi . 1 P. 20513/38. 571849/36/C.0.1.
