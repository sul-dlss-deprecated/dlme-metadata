Referred to The Secretary Public Works Department. It will be remembered (P.QoA^Jthat in April 1924 the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department handed over to this Department the telegraph line from Hurmak to Seistan in Eastern Persia. During the war when this line was in the hands of the military authorities a branch telegraph line, about 50 miles in length, was built from Girdi, a station on the Hurmak-Seistan line, to a place called Safaidawa and this branch was handed over with the main line. The branch line is of no use to this Department; it is worked by the Persians and such revenue as there is belongs wholly to that Administration. The cost of maintenance is therefore a useless expense to us; and if dismantled the cost of carriage of the material to any '.'ff,4831/25, point where it could be utilised or sold would probably exceed its value. In these circurnstances I instructed the Director to endeavour to negotiate its sale to the Persian Government and he reports that after protracted negotiations they have agreed to purchase it for Krs.25,000 which at I the present rate of exchange is equivalent to about Rs.7,900, a little more than half the original cost of the line, Rs.14,300. The Persian Telegraph Administration however • &lt; * • ask f\\ ask that, since there is no provision for the purchase •in their 'budget for the current year, payment may he ^ deferred* untilt the budget estimates for nex-t year are passed by the Majless. The Director at Teheran recommends the acceptance of this offer and asks for permission to hand over the line at once to the Persians, I concur with the Director's recommendation in order toanroid spending any more money on maintaining the line. It would of course be more satisfactory if we could get payment for the line at* once, but the debt being acknowledged by Persia there is good reason to expect that we shall get payment at some time. I therefore submix that I may be authorised to sell the* branch telegraph line from Girdi to Safaidawa to the Persian Telegraph Administration for Krs. 25,000 on the understanding that payment will be made when the Persian budget estimates for the next year are passed by the Majless. (Sd. ) M.G, Simpson. Political Secretary. For any observations. (Sd. ) Robert Mowbray. 30.10.25. The negotiations for the transfer of the Meshed- Seistan line to Persian control appear to have ended in Feoruary 1924 (p.2107/24), the Persian Government promising to pay 40^ of the expenses incurred by the British authorities on the repair and improvement of 1 * 4 the line. This expenditure was estimated to-be Krs,360,000, and it is clear from Mr.Hew's letter ofAZ the Girdi-Safaida^va line. At the end of 1923, however, the Government of India said, they did not propose to transfer (to Persia) any lines South of Seistan, The position is not quite clear; presumably, since the Director at Tehran has been negotiating separately about the short Girdi- Safaidawa line, it has been decided to omit the cost of this line, Krs.50,050, from the claim for Krs.360,000 in respect of the 'Meshed-Seistan” line. The Director has made a better bargain than the AQ% agreement of 1924 - though I do not share the Director- in-Ghief’s optimistic belief that if Persia acknowledges a debt she will pay it. There is a further point; who paid for the Girdi-Safaidawa line? This Department cannot say definitely; but the line appears to have been put up by the East Persia Gordon in 1918, and the cost would therefore, as a military charge, be debited to His Majesty’s Government. If this view is correct it would be desirable to consult the Foreign Office before authorising the Director in Chief to conclude the transaction. The Treasury will not object to the terms of the sale, for they were prepared in 1922 to hand over the Meshed-Seistan line to Persia without any claim on account of improvements, repairs, etc. (P.3269/22). I suppose the Indo European Telegraph Department cannot say definitely how the cost of the short line has been charged up?

Re Unde With reference to Foreign Office letter No. 5134/261/34 of June 16th, I am directed by Mr. Secretaiy Ramsay MacDonald to transmit to you, to be laid before Lord Olivier, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charg4 d’Affaires at Tehran relative to the disposal of the Kerind-Khanikin telegraph line. 2. It will be seen that the Persian Government now agree, in return for the handing over to them of the above line, to pay the sum of twelve thousand tomans, for which Mr. Ovey stipulated in accordance with the decision arrived at by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury and conveyed in their letter of June 12th to this department. The Persian Government are not, however, prepared to make immediate payment of the whole sum, but propose to liquidate the debt in two equal instalments by debits to the terminal rate and traffic account for 1922-1923 and 1923-1924. The Secretary of State is, however, inclined to accept this offer, subject to the sanction of the Treasury, which is being invi ted. 3. The Persian Government, in addition, have refused to accept as they stand two conditions which the Director of the Persian Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, considered it desirable to include. The first of these conditions is that no counter-claims on account of the /traffic r-Secretary of State, India Office.traffic on the Kasvin-Haniadan and Hamadan-IChanikin lines shall he made. The second condition is that the right of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to resume at any time the control of the line from Tehran to Khanikin under article 16 of the 1872 Convention is recognised as not being abrogated. 4. The Persian Government agree to the first of these two conditions, but only by including it in a reciprocal clause that neither party shall have any further claim against the other regarding these lines. As regards the second condition, the Persian Government claim that the 1872 Convention does not apply. Mr. Ovey is inclined to share that view on the ground that the rights of His Majesty 1 s Government under the 1872 Convention have been abrogated by the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, and adduces in proof of this a despatch dated August 26th 1907 from Sir A. Hi colson, then His Majesty*s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, from which it would appear that His Majesty*s Government handed over to the Russian Government their rights over the Khanikin-Tehran line. 5. Under article 2 of the General Treaty with the Soviet Government of August 8th, 1924, the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 is recognised as having lost its force. The Secretary of State is, however, advised that it would not be proper for this reason to advance the claim that His Majesty’s Government have consequently resumed their rights under the 1872 Convention over the Khanikin-Tehran telegraph line. These rights became Russian in 1907 and when, in its treaty with Persia of February 26th 1921, the Soviet /GovernmentGovernment agreed to hand over all Hussian telegraph lines in Persia to the Persian Government, the Khanikin-Tehran li ne &gt; inter alia , presumably became the property of the Persian Government. The fact that owing to the state of war this line was taken over and worked by British troops would not appear to strengthen the British case for insisting on this condition in the present negotiations with the Persian Government. 6. In these circumstances it is proposed, if Lord Olivier concurs, to authorise Mr. Ovey to agree to the conditions of settlement now proposed by the Persian Government. 7. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Treasury. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,In aoooardaace with your raquedt I entered into correspondence with the . inijtor of Poets and felegraphs regarding the ^-erind-x.hanikin line which was offered to the Persian Governnent hy ir 'ercy Vnrains, at a meeting which tooh place at the Persian Boat Office, for the sum of l:i f OOO r i'onan{3. oopiGS of the correspondenoe which has paaaed between the I iniater of So 3 ts and (Telegraphs und myself, and shall be glad to know if you wish me to do anything further in the matter. -Ci will notice that the minister of ^osts and telegraphs states that:- (i) the jpayment of 12'sOG Tomans wiU be made in two ins t aim ent s. (d) that neither party shall in futbre have any iu.- ohor claim against each other regarding the nasvin-Hamad&amp;n and liamadan-iChanikin lines, and (3) that the provision of the 1872 Convention does not apply to this question. The Minister of ?osts and Telegraphs does not appear to|dmve given any definite assurance that the right of the Indo-juropean Telegraph Department to resume control of the Teheran-i'hanikin line under the 1872 Convention is recognised, while his statement'that neither party shall in future have any further claim against each other regarding the Kasvin-Hamadan and Hamadan-hanikin lines f might, at. some future time, be interpreted by the Persian Government as abrogating the provision made under Artivle XVI of the 1872 Convention. I have been given to understand that our righto /in 'in thij respect were jarrendered to the Ha^eians by the fj f Treaty of 1907, but aa this Treaty has X believe beon ^ abrot^ated I assume that our rights still hold good. As however I havo no official documents on this subject I am not ruite sure how we stand. If our rights no longer exist or aro open to doubt, it would be a good thing if the Minister of ?osta and Telegraphs could be got to state that he agrees to recognise that we have the rights given to us by the 1872 Convention.

Sir, With reference to Mr. Mowbray's letter ijo.P.W- 1410/24, dated the 13th May 1924, I am directed to say that from the latest information received from the Accou -ant-General, Posts and Telegraphs, the actual expenditur on account of the maintenance of the whole Meshed-Seista: Duzdab line from the 22nd November 1920 to the 25th Feb ruary 1924 was Rs. 1,73,422; of which Rs. 1,42,227 may be taken as the proportionate cost of maintenance and working of the Meshed-Seistan Section, which was handed over to the Persian Governnent on the 26th February 1924.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram of the 24th instant, I have the honour to report as follows:- ♦ (1) The negotiations regarding the handing over of the Mashad-Sistan Line were conducted by H.B.M*s Legation. The representatives of the Persian Goverhinent naturally wished to get hold of the line as cheaply as possible and did not see why they should repay the amounts expended by another Govern ment which took over the line for its own purposes without the consent of the Persian Government. Eventually a compromise was reached and the Persian Government agreed to pay 40% of the amount disbursed by the British Government on asoount of improvements and repairs but not including the salaries of the staff. (2) The figure originally given by the Legation to the Persians was Tomans 26,000. This was based on items (1) (2) and (3) of the accompanying statement. It was pointed out toy me to the Legation that the amourt of Krans 256,850 did not include the cost of repairs, which excluding salaries, was as follows:- Krans From 1918 when line was taken over to November 1921 75,000 w November 1921 to 25th June 1923 22^088,. Total to 25th June 1923 $7,0m This, added to Krans 256,850 brou^it the grand total up to Krans 353,938 to which had to be added the expenditure on improvements and repairs from 25th June 1923 do the date of handing oaer the line. To include this expenditrure ana to round off the figure the total was given to the Persian Government as Krans 360,000. The actual expenditure on repairs from■ from 25th June. 1923. to 29th Pfthrrmrv 19?A woo subsequently your telegram of the 12th instant were arrived at; but I have little doubt that they include the salaries of Major Kilman and his Staff, whether telegraph or postal and whether employed on the line from Mashad to Sistan or Sistan to Duzdab.

I’io’ioi’' --------- D. With reference to the last paragraph of Mr. Simpson’s note deted the 7th January 1924, I m directed to reply that the Meshed Seistan line cannot in any sense be regarded as p*rt of the Indian Telegraph system nor can the charges there on be properly debited to the Indian Department. From such evidence a.s is available with the Government of India the position is as follows.- (1) On 3rd September 1920 His Brittanic Majesty’s Minis ter at Tehran proposed to the Government of India that tfr Indo-European Telegraph Department might arrange to take c r g©&lt;25 M ® ^ i 3 K/J&gt;~ choree of the line and he stated that he was informing the Director, Persian Section to this effect. (-) On the 7th December 1920 the Government of India informed the Minister at Tehran that arrangements could not be made from India for the Indo-European Telegraph . Department to take over the line but meanwhile the per sonnel of that Department remained at their posts though military liability for their payetc., ceased from 22nd ovember 1920. Tho Government of India further suggested that, if the Department had no personnel available to '- take over the line, arrangements might be made with the lii 1 otor^ Persian Section to assume responsibility for the line, borrowing the services of Major Kilman and other personnel. These arrangements might continue until the Minister could relieve them with his own staff or come to some arrangement with the Persian Government. (3) On the 14th July 1921 the Minister at Tehran in formed the Government of India that the Indo-European Telegraph Department agreed to bear the cost of Maior V Kilman's deputation to Tehran and that they would be glad of his services for supervision of the Duzdab Meshed line together with existing st??ff until the Department could find their own substitutes. (4) It may also be gathered from the Secretary of State’s telegram Mo.4070 dated the 11th August 1921 that the Indo-European Telegraph Department did assume res ponsibility for the line. (5) It further appears from a telegram of 24th Novem ber 1921 from the Minister, Tehran to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the Indo- European Telegraph Department under instructions from the Director-in-Chief were negotiatingnegotiating with the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs regarding the disposal of this line. 3. ^rom the above it is clear that it was always the intention,that responsibility for the line should be with the Indo-European Telegraph Department and the only connec tion which the Indian Telegraphs have had with the line is, that pending further arrangements, they agreed to lend their personnel for the maintenance of the line. 4. I am to add that when the charge to Indian Revenues for the maintenance of the line was recently under consi deration by the Standing Finance Committee of the Assembly and also when a. supplementary demand for the purpose came before the Assembly, it was emphasised that every effort should be made by Government to obtain a refund of an out lay which rightly ought not to fall upon the Indian tax payer.

The Government of India observe that the Persian Government desire to keep the line in their hands and have agreed to the payment of 40 per cent of the expenses incurred by His Majesty's Government for the maintenance and improve ment of the line from the date on which it came under their control. It is however not clear whether this statement of expenses will include the charges incurred from Indian revenues rrom the 22nd November 1920, when the British forces evacuated that area, till the date on which tjie line is handed over to the Pe-sian Government. The Government of India have no infomation ^ t0 aCtUal aD1 ° Unt invol - ed I am to suggest that this my ^ ° btaine&lt;i fr ° m the Direc tor-in-Chief in London. They are, however, of opinion that xvhatever the o er tne amount a proportionate share should be credited to Indian revenues. I am accordingly to request that the matter may be placed before His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and that if there is no objection '2 the Foreign Office may be addressed with a view to obtain the requisite refund. 2. I am in this connection to invite a reference to the telegram from His Excellency the Viceroy (Public Works Department) to the Secretary of State for India, No.324-P.W., dated the 19th February 1923, and as regards paragraph 1(7) thereof to say that the omission of the provision for the working of the line from the budget estimates of the Indo- European Telegraph Department for the current year was re commended by the Retrenchment Committee presumably under a misapprehension. The Government of India have after careful consideration decided that the charges on account of the maintenance of the line from the 22nd November 1920 should be debited to the Indo-European Telegraph Department and authorised the Accountant-General^Posts and Telegraphs to make Department for the current year. A copy of the letter to the Accountant-General, No.l44-P.T., dated the 3th December 1923, is enclosed for infoimation and for communication to the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department. the necessary provision in the revised estimates of that I have the honour to be, t, C SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIACopy of a letter N 0 .144-P.T., dated the 8th December 1923, from the Biuancial Adirlaer, Posts and Telegraphs, to the Accountant-General, Posts and Telegraphs.

Cn receipt of Lord Curzon’s telegram No. 185 The of 27th September 1925, agreeing to separate tMs from the other telegraph questions, Uie draft of ray note was prepared and submitted to the Persian Government, but it was a considerable time before their final approval of its terras, and the submission of their draft rer,ly t could be extracted from them; with the result that Fushir- ed-DowlebPa Cabinet fell juet before the matter could be carried through. Before it was taken up with the new Government, &amp; fresh point was brought to Liy notice, viz. the right of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to deal with British official messages over this line, through operators of its own stationed at lieshed and Seistan and, if necessary, at Birjand. The Department had exercised this right for some years before the war, but it was apparently only based on the special permission granted by the Persian Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs in 1903 for the Government of India to station two signallers at /Seistan Right Honourable J.

This gave th m an opportunity for a further ai6pla&gt;- of their vexatiously dilatory methods; moreover, in view ox the wording of their reply* I considered it neceaary to wait till tne Indo-Surer* e&amp;n fere graph Department had secured the written agreement of the Ministry oi Posts ana Telegraphs t • the arrangement beicxe signing my note.

Monsieur le liinistre, I have the honour, under Instructions iron* His Britannic Majesty’s Government, to address Your Excellency on the subject cf the Heshed-Sei st«a telegraph line. your Excellence is aware that, before the great Suropean war, the reperoueoione of which were unfortunately felt in this country nlsc, this line was under the control of the Russian authorities. When these retired the British Military forces took oyer the control of the line, which, on their withdrawal, passed into the hands of the Indian State Telegraph Department. The latter has faithfully maintained the efficient operation of the line in the interests of Persia as well as of international traffic, but the Imperial Persian Government, in the natural desire that it should be under the national admin- istration, has on several occasions renuestec 1 that it should be handed over to the Persian Telegraph Department. This question, together with others relating to telegraphic matters, has been under discussion between the Imperial Telegraph Department aad His Majesty's Legation, in the course of which it has been made clear that His Majesty's Government are ready to accede to the Imperial Government's wish. Hie Majesty's Legation, however, pointed out that His Majesty's Government would be S lsd to be assured that it is not the intention of the Imperial Government to allow the line to fall into the hands of any other Foreign Power; end also that His Majesty's Government had incurred considerable expense in repairing /andand maintaining the line which it was only reasonable should be refunded to thera, though a deduction 'tight be made as a rental for the use of the line by the British Telegraph Department. The Imperial Department, in reply, assured the Legation that the Iirraerial Government’s intentions as regards the future control of the line were as stated above, and declared that the Imperial Government were preonred to refund to His lajlesty’s Government forty r er cent of the expenses referred to above. Your Excellency will no doubt be so good as to confirm these assurances on ths part of the Imperial Government. I have duly submitted this proposal to His Majesty’s Government, and am now authorised to inform Your Excellency that, in their earnest desire to meet the wishes of the Imperial Government in the friendliest possible manner, they are willing to accept this great reduction of their claim and to proceed accordingly to hand over the coniml of the line to the Persian Administrate on&gt; I should be oblige i if Your Excellency would be so good as to confirm to me the declarations of the Imperial Telegraph Department in order that we may have the pleasure of concluding the natter, the satisfactory settlement of which is a proof of the friendly relations between our two governments. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my high consideration. (Sd.)

With regard to the ndmini strati on of the line v our Excellency can rest assured that the intention of the government has been in the past and will be in the future that the line in question should be administered as usual under the exclusive s-nervision of the Persian officials. With re mird to the facilities asked for the traffic of the I.F.T.D. on the line above mentioned, and the statement made that the samo facilities had been observed by the Persian telegraph authorities before the war, it is expedient that the telegraph department should refer th© matter In the Ministry of Posts end Telegraphs and any arrangement arrived at between the two parties should be carried out.

Moraine objected to this proposal on the grounds that (a) the sanction of the ilajlie would be necessary in vie* of the financial provisions of the Agreement; and (b) in view of the elimination of the Jask branch, provision must be made for linking up the line with the Henjam cable: provision was nade for this in the new draft.
