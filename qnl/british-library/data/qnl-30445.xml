D .0 . No -S . The Residency, Bub hire, 20th September 1923- Lighting and Buoying of the Persian dulf. &gt; \ My dear In order to erive effect to what they call the 'recogtoised principle that services rendered to navigaticn should be self-supporting” the Government of India are considering the possibility of levying dues from all shipp ing traversing the Persian Gulf and benefiting by the lighting and buoying services at present freely given to navigation in those waters by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. FVf the purposes of general navigation there &amp; j- are at present in Persian Gulf waters three lighthouses , viz . on the quoin island f on Tamb island and at Muscat ; one lightship off the Coast of Kais island ; a light vessel and lighted buoy at the Shatt-el-^rab Bar j and two lignt- ed buoys at both Bushire and Bahrain. Government s pro posal is to treat all these lights as forming one group, and to charge a flat rate for the service is a whole which will, it is thought, most conveniently take the form of dues from all ships entering the Gulf. in calculating how much they are likely to coll ect in this way , the Government of India (wno £ave lately addressed the political Resident fin this subject) observe that the anticipated revenue M is exclusive of possible receipts from sailing craft'; and they have enquired as levying to the possibility of 1W1 dues from such otaft, the port iports at which the levy if feasible should b© made, ‘ind the rates which should be charged . the legal position and locus btaadi ol Hie Majesty's QoverniLent and the Gov ernment of India are coubOful it is not possible at this st a ge to take the rulers concerned into consultation. But the Political ^esideni ^ould oe glad to have your opin ion whether the Sultan of Muscat wouin consent to suoh a levy? at what ports its imposition woulc be practicable, and what r^we of feoij would be suitable having regard to the cost of the gervice( which may be t^en to be about four lacs a year) and the proportion of benefit derived from it by sailing craft. Colonel Knox, I am to say, does not think that tnere is the smallest chance that arab rulers would agree to any such levy; but the Government 0 f India consider it desirable that it should be introduced if possible. .another matter on which the Government of India desire information is the possibility of recovering dues for the us© of port lights at Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait. win you please consult the Sultan of Muscat confidentially as to this p T oponal , and il he is agreeable , let Colonel K*&gt;taL know what rates you would consider suitable f in oon- *1 suit 'ti on with the ruler. fr. ^Huscct, tb« 13th nov«nb*» 1923. .

The Persian Government would a ver agree to the levy ol dues from Persian cralt lor tne benefit ol anybody but themselves, ftnd it would be highly invidious il ^rao sailing cralt had to pay light dues wniie Persian Bailing cralt did not.

P .%li Ferrash, who attends to the above lights reports that last night when he returned after lighting the Cove light, he found that it was not burning* He returned to the cove at once and found that the chimney was broken and the whole lantern was black with smoke# He cleaned the lantern and replaced the damaged lamp with a light from the guard room. The damage appears to have been done by use of petrol in stead of kerosene oil as he says the tin supplied by the ^.P.O.C. agents yesterday as kerosene oil for this purpose was actually pterol. I have sent for the.agents and his explanation will be submitted to you. In the meantime, if you permit, the lamp may be repaired and a new chimney issued please? V/c ^ 23^KC35* »(Pt FrJJU Lrs Mr* Mohammed Khan came personally and admitted the that fault was of his own man. ^e and his clerk were on board the ship when the tin was issued by his servant, who being new made the mistake. The lamp has been sent for repairs and it will cost us annas 12. The chimneys were supplied by the K.I.M. the cost of which is not known but may be taken as annas 8. Total damage was Hs.1/4.
