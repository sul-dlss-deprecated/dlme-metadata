I have made the necessary comainication to the Sheikh, who signed the concession in my presence today.21st December,1934. k. 0 Z.7813/34. &gt;0 Gentlemen, I an directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your interview at the India Office on 17th December,in which you reported that agreement had now been reached between youand His Excellency the Sheikh of ICoweit on the subject of the terms of an oil concession in respect of Eoweit and that His Excellency was prepared to sign the concession in your favour immediately, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government * 2* It was understood in the earlier discussions between your company and His Majesty’s Government that no objection would be raised to the grant of a concession by the Sheikh to your company, subject to certain specified conditions* These conditions have been fulfilled, and having regard to the understanding in question and to the fact that the Sheikh has now decided to grant the concession to your company, I am directed to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have approved the Sheikh’s decision and to say that it is assumed that you will now take the necessary steps to complete the signature of your agreement with His Excellency. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant,21st December 1934* % / P.Z. 7815/34. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state that he has had under consideration your letter of 28th November, PLH/WGL*, on the question of the grant of an oil concession in Xoweit to Messrs * Traders Limited. 2. On receipt of your letter of 28th November, which was the first intimation which he received from your Company that they were interested in the matter, the Secretary of State took steps to ascertain from the Sheikh of Koweit the position in regard to his r elations with Traders Limited* The Sheikh has now stated in reply to this enquiry that the letter of 2nd September to Mr.Gabriel, of which a copy was enclosed in your letter under reference, was not in any way intended to represent the grant of a concession to your Company by him. He added that as he had heard nothing further from your Company subsequently to the date of that letter he informed Mr.Gabriel on 12th December that he was about to come to terms with the Kuwait Oil Company and that on 15th December he t elegraphed to Mr. Gabriel that he had done so and that further conversations with your Company must cease. 3. I am to explain that His Majesty's Government have for some considerable time been guided in regard to the question of the grant of oil concessions in Koweit, by certain definite principles which they felt bound to adopt in view of the special circumstances of the case, and which are well known to the Sheikh and to the various applicants who have from time to time approached His Majesty's/ LI.Hunting Esq., c/o. Messrs.S.A. Gibson &amp; Co.Ltd., 88, Leadenhall Street, E.C. 3.2 . Majesty’s Government in the matter. The effect of these principles is that the responsibility for deciding as to the giant of an oil concession shall rest with His excellency subject to the following conditions;— (a) that the Sheikh (and similarly any applicant for a concession) should consult with His Majesty’s Government be!ore entering into negotiations for a concession and that His Majesty’s Government should be kept fully informed of all negotiations in connection with the grant of any concession; (b) that arrangements should be made to ensure that the interests of His Majesty’s Government should be specifically safeguarded in the event of any concession being granted; (c) that the interests of the Sheikh himself and of his principality should be sufficiently safeguarded in any concession granted. 4. As you are aware, the Kuwait Oil Company have for a considerable period been in negotiation with the Sheikh. Before initiating those negotiations the Kuwait Oil Company placed themselves in touch with His Majesty’s Government and were informed of the conditions set out above. Having undertaken to satisfy those conditions they were informed that no objection was seen to their initiating negotiations with His Excellency and they were also given to understand, long before it was known that your Company were in the field, that in the event of their reaching agreement with the Sheikh as to the terms of a concession within the limits indicated above, the approval of His Majesty’s Government to the grant of such concession would not be withheld* of the negotiations between Messrs# Traders/ 5. In the casev!) . Tra,ders Limited and the Sheikh, no approach was made to His Majesty’s Government by your Company and no information that they desired to secure a concession in respect of this area was received by His Majesty’s Government until 28th November, although from the papers submitted with their application on that date it appeared that discussions with the Sheikh had reached an advanced stage by 2nd September. Despite the request in the opening paragraph of the Sheikh’s letter of 2nd September (which, as explained above, the Sheikh states that he did not in any way regard as.constituting a grant of a concession to your Company) that your Company should place themselves in communication with His Majesty’s Government and obtain a telegraphic reply, a delay of almost three months took place before any communication was made to His Majesty’s Government by your Company, by which time, the negotiations between the Sheikh and the Kuwait Oil Ccmpany had been completed except for one or two minor points. 6. Having regard to the understanding with the Kuwait Oil Company referred to in paragraph 4 aoove, to the fact that the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 have been satisfied by that Company, and that the Sheikh, in the exercise of his choice, has elected to grant, a concession to that company, and to the communication which His Excellency states he has made to Mr. Gabriel, the Secretary of State now directs me to say that His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to interfere with the decision which the Sheikh has reached. They have therefore informed His Excellency, in accordance with the understanding previously/4* I ^ previously reached with the Kuwait Oil Company, that they concur in his granting the concession to that Company* I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,2621 6000 3/34 fa Minute Paper. ‘i political Department. n tcc /vy£ Discussions with tHe Kuwait Oil Gonipariv aurin g December 1U^4 in rega rd to the terms of tKzTv ' Gorimercial Agreement wTtn the ,3ae ikii. On 11th December we were informed that the Sheikh had delivered to the Kuwait Oil Company negotiators a letter embodying the 'final points' which he wished introduced in the draft commercial Agreement. The Company on 12th December informed us of these points (Mr. Kemp's letter on P.z.7615/34), which are described in detail in the memorandum at flag K. The record of the discussion which took place with the Company on this subject is flagged J. None of the points was of direct interest to H.M.G. except that affecting the position of the Chief Local Representative. On this, far the reasons given in the record of the aiscussion (which was submitted on P.Z.7621/34 flagged), the department agreed to meet the Company, but suggested that if possible the words 'in the first instance' in Article 6(a) should be translated in the English text as 'on the first occasion'. 2 . Sheikh, who has since accepted their terms and intimated that he desires to give them the concession. They reported this to us yesterday and asked for the approval of H.M.G. A separate submission on the question whether approval is to be given to the grant i of the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company and on the question of the reply to be sent to the application submitted by Messrs. Traders Ltd.is being made simultaneously with the present. In the course of the discussion the Company's representatives intimated that/ The Company thereupon/clinchttfil with the2 . that they had secured the sheikh's concurrence in the substitution for the words ,f in the first instance'’ of the words ’’on the first occasion” in Article 6(a) and that a minor amendment had also been made in Article I 6(c).

IfL Plaase see the record of a meeting at the India Office with the Kuwait Oil Company on 12th December, which is self-explanatory• It would have been p-referable had it been possible to avoid making any statement to the Company aoout the application from Traders Ltd. But it seemed impossible to do this in face of their direct question and of the previous discussions which have taken place between us as to the existence of other competitors. There seemed little doubt, moreover, as the conversation proceeded that the Company were not in the dark as to what was going on* The statements made were, of course, non-committal in the extreme, the danger of exposing ourselves to the charge that we were assisting an Anglo- American combine against a purely British company being fully realised. The rt final points' introduced in the draft are all of them commercial points, save one affecting the position of the Chief Local Representative. At a further interview to-day the Company stated that they had ascertained from Koweit that the revise of clause 6(a) of the draft agreement which the sheikh was anxious to secure would run as follows;- 'The Company shall maintain in the region of the Persian Gulf a Chief Local Representative to represent it in natters relating to this agreement with the sheikh. The sheikh has the right to select in the first instance tne Chief Local Representative in consultation with His Lajesty's Government'; ana that the implication of the words 'in the first instance' was 'on the first occasion'. They undertook to confirm tnis in writing, and if the Arabic phrase woula stand translation/—translation equally well as 'on me first occasion' to instruct their representatives to use that phrasing. After considerable discussion, having regard to the full safeguards for me. position of H.M.G. embodied In clause 4 of the Poliuxcal Agreement, the official representatives felt that it was hardiy worth standing out on this point and informed the Company that they were prepared to abandon it. ^* ihe Company then intimated that they proposed to accept me Sheikh’s 'final points' in full and to instruct their negotiators to clinch the agreement. They were informed in substance that we were not cone erne ci with their Handling of their own commercial negotiations, out that they must understand that signature by the Sheikh and the approval of H.L.G. were two different things and that it might be necessary for nm.C. to proceed with consideration of the application which had been officially submitted to them by other interests and of the existence of which me Company had oeen informed yesterday, before deciding whether their approval could be given. We may hope in tne immediate future to have lurther information from colonel Dickson as to the position of the Sheikh vis-a-vis Traders Ltd., but it seems better to warn the Political Resident at once of the latest developments and in particular to emphasise H.M.G.'s approval to any agreement which me Kuwait Oil Company may now secure from me sheikh is not to be taken/'S taken for granted, thougii iie is prodabiy In no doubt as to the true position* h* A draft telegram is attached.\ \ Draft Paper. political Department.

Note of Discussion at the India Office on Wednesday, The Company’s representatives had asked for an interview in order to report the ’’final points” which the Sheikh of Koweit wished emhodied in the Commercial Agreement and details of which they had now received from their representatives. 2. The points in question are attached as an appendix to this note. Mr.Stevens intimated that the Company were telegraphing to Koweit to clear up certain obscurities and that the Company’s representatives would probably ask for an interview to-morrow to discuss these matters further if a rep^-y had been received by then. On the commercial side the Sheikh had now made it quite clear that he insisted on the 'won and saved” basis. The other points involved were of relatively minor importance. So far as the Government is concerned the Company were anxious to know whether in the interest of closing the negotiations the Government would be prepared to accept the modification now proposed in the article dealing with the appointment of the Chief Local Representative. Mr.Stevens was informed that this question would be further considered. 3. Mr.Stevens then enquired whether in the event of the Company deciding to adjourn negotiations in the hope of bringing the Sheikh to a more Present : Mr.J.C.Walt on, Mr.J.G.Laithwait e. Mr. St evens ) T _ Mr.Kemp ) ^ uwal ^ Kuwait Oil Co. reasonable/reasonable frame of mind they could be sure that no other competitor would be allowed to enter the lists. Could we confirm that no application had in fact been received from any other competitor ? 4. Mr.Walt on replied that an application had in fact now been received. He was not in a position to make any statement regarding it, since we were not ourselves at this stage fully informed of the position in regard to the applicants and the negotiations in which they had been engaged. We were waiting for confirmation or otherwise from the Sheikh of information given us by the applicant. If, when the points which were still in obscurity had been cleared up, it was necessary to entertain the application, the Kuwait Oil Company would of course at once be informed. 5. Mr.Stevens expressed concern at the news that another applicant was in the field and asked a number o... questions which suggested that he had some knowledge bo hi of the fact that an all British company had applied,that the B.O.D.might be interested,and that Parliamentary pressure might be brought to bear in lavour Ou. an all British company as against a Company which, like the Kuwait Oil Company, was 50^ American. He enquired in particular whether, in the event of the applicant proving to represent a substantial business such as would have to be considered by , the nationally question assuming that the terms offered by the compering company and the Kuwait Oil Company were in other reap- &amp; identical, would make any difference to the attitude of H.M.G. He was informed in reply that it was impossible to deal with the question hypothetically, and before wo receive the information for which we are waiting. But that nationality was one of the various questions vviuc- H.M.G. would have to take into account in dealing with any application which they had to consider and that it was impossible to say more than that. Mr.Stevens might, however, be sure that full and fair consideration would3 ( 21 be given to all parties concerned. 6* Mr.Stevens said that there had been during his association with the'Kuwait Oil Company considerable Parliamentary criticism of the fact that American interests had been allowed to establish themselves in the Persian Gulf. would that make any difference to the attitude of the Government? Mr.Walton replied that it was obvious that a democratic government cannot altogether ignore criticism, whether ill-founded or not. Mr.Stevens finally enquired whether, if the Company were preimred to meet the Sheikh on all outstanding points and the Sheikh were in consequence to sign the concession on Monday, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to grant their approval, or whether they would hold up approval pending investigation of the application put forward by the new competitor. He was informed in reply that we could not say; an answer which he received with some concern. 7. In conclusion, Mr.Stevens was informed that as we did not yet know where we stood in regard to the new applicant we should have preferred to say nothing to him at this stage. He had been given this information only because he had specifically asked for it, and on the understanding that it would be regarded as entirely confidential and should not be repeated to the Persian Gulf. He said that he agreed as to this, but was anxious to b e allowed to mention it to Mr.Fraser as representing the A.P.O.C. share m the Kuwait Oil Company. He was informed that he might do this, but on the same understanding. It would do nothing but harm if this information were to become generally known at the present stage. Once we knew where we stood in regard to the new application we would then be able to tell him something officially* Later. /4 . Later* Mr.Eraser telephoned and asked ?/hat the effect would be if his Company did, v/hat they ordinarily might do in a case of commercial competition, viz: clinch with the Sheikh as soon as possible. Mr.Walton said he did not think it would be of advantage to anybody to rush matters with the Sheikh, since if our enquiries show that the other competitor’s application has to be taken seriously, we should in any case have to consider his proposition in conjunction with that of the Kuwait Oil Company.

INDIA OFFICE . CONFIDENTIAL . Note of telephone conversation with Lord Lloyd on 12th December 1934„ Lord Lloyd rang me up to-day and said that he had heen thinking over the Gulf oil position further and that he felt that all the information that reached him tended to show that things were going from bad to worse and that there was a real danger of the Americans establishing themselves in Koweit. He had, as I knew, most reluctantly refrained over what was now a long period from ventilating this question in Parliament, but he dia not feel that he could do so any longer and he thought he might find it necessary to put down a question in the House of Lords before Christmas. I said that this must, of course, be a matter entirely for his decision. 3o far as I was aware there had been no recent material change in the situation. 2. Lord Lloyd then enquired whether we could give him any understanding that, if he did not press the matter in Parliament at this stage, no final decision would be taken in the Gulf. I said that, as I had warned him before, these commercial negotiations, which had been proceeding for a very long time, had reached a very advanced stage, and that, while it was not for me to say, I thought it was impossible to give any such guarantee. Lord Lloyd expressed great regret at this, but asked that we should bear his point in mind and give it consideration. J♦G.

For convenience X enumerate below the following points \ bearing on this question:- ^ j (a) Article 4 of the Political Agreement dated 5th Kerch 1934 between His Majesty's Government and the Kuwait Oil Company stipulated that one of the superior local employees of the Company shall be designated Chief Local Representative of the Company in n „-p p:-i a Males tv' s Government shall e Kuwait and that the approval of his Majesuy required for the person so designated. _ , , . -i .-.ar.t dated the 13th April (b) In a letter to the Political ? . + -p-pj r&gt;s»l I v communicated his approval ox 1934, the Shaikh of Kuwait official y th&lt;E| political Agreement (c) / DC —1 B6SS&amp;P —(M-1821)—-27 9-32-—2^80,000.-2 Vs (c) In a letter dated the 26th May 1934 (vide Bushire Printed Letter No .551-3 9 dated the 13th June 1934) the Shaikh agreed,inter alia, that should any of the terms of the Commercial Agreement Between him and the Kuwait Oil Company be inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of the Political Agreement of 5th March 1934 between His Majesty’s Government and the Company, the former would, to the extent oi such inconsistency, or conflict, be subordinate to, and oe control led by the latter, (d) The Shaikh’s agreement referred to in (c) has been communicated to the Kuwait Oil Company, who have accepted the arrangement as binding, and this acceptance has been communicated officially to the Shaikh of Kuwait. (e) The position, therefore, is that the question oj. the appointment of the Chief Local Representative has been settled, in a manner that is binding both on the Shaikh ana the Company. 3 . The letter referred to in your telegram Mp^2342, dated the 4th October 1934, was addressed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Shaikh on 4th October. As the Shaikh's reply was unsatisfactory, the Political Agent subsequently interviewed him and the Shaikh finally promised that he would not raise the question of the Chief Local Representative with the Company's representatives and that if the concession was granted to the Company he would agree formally in writing that the method of appointment of the Chief Local Representa tive would be as indicated in the Political Agent's letter. Please see the Political Agent's report (Express Letter ho. C-261, dated the 11th October 1934) in this connection, copy forwarded to you direct. 4. Nothing^ however, which either His Majesty’s Government /Government or the Shaikh have since said or done affects in any way our position given in paragraph 2 (e) above. 5. I think it likely that the Shaikh will either (a) when he has granted the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company, approach His Majesty’s Government to concede to him, as a favour, the right of selecting tne Chief Local Representative subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, or (b) when he has reached agreement with the Company’s representatives on all points now at issue, make the grant of the concession dependent on his being allowed by nis Majesty’s Government the right of selecting the C&amp;ief Local Representative subject to their approval. 6 . For the present, as the Shaikh has promised not to raise the question with the Company's negotiators, it will not act as an obstacle to the progress of the negotiations. sd.

PRESENT: Mr.S t ev ens )Kuwait Mr.Hearn )0il Mr.Kemp )Company. Mr.Walton ) Mr.Laithwaite ) India Office. Mr.Crombie ) Mr.Starling Petroleum Dept. Mr. Walton said that the meeting had 'been arranged at the request of the Company on receiving a copy of his d.o. letter No.P.S* 6325/34, of 13th October, reminding them that the India Office had reserved the right to examine the financial terms of the Koweit Concession. themselves as in loco parentis to the Sheikh in this matter. He suggested that they should also regard themselves as in the same relationship to the Company in view of their past association together with the implication that they would be prepared to exert their influence to check the Sheikh’s greed* Mr.Stevens said that he had always understood from Sir Louis Kershaw that the commercial side of the negotiations would be left to the Company and that H.M.G-* were only interested in seeing that the Sheikh got a M.r deal. Mr.Walton explained that the draft Concession hadbeen carefully scrutinised at an early stage by His Majesty’s Government. It had then been arranged that the Company should enter into negotiation with the Sheikh without intervention from His Majesty’s Government on the understanding that the Political Agent was kept informed of the course of the negotiations. Mr.Hearn said he understood that H.M.G. regarded3 n • sheikh whilst some represented &gt;/7hat the Company were prepared to offer; and that the payments on account of royalty and tax exemption had been kept separate advice cbtained by the A.'P.O.C. if a specific w©_' e made i or t-ax exemption it was thought that on legal payment it would be easier to make that exemption permanent. Mr.otevens then alluded to a proposed visit of the oheikh to Londoni which had been mentioned in previous discussions with the Company. He said that the Company had now offered the Sheikh Rs. 25,000 for the expenses of any journey which he might wish to take out of Koweit, if and when he signed the Concession. He explained that in this way the Company would avoid the embarrassment of having to entertain the Sheikh in the event of a visit to England. Mr.Laithwaite pointed out that the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s royalty had been fixed at Rs.3.8.0. per ton in accordance with Indian practice whereas the Company now proposed to give the Sheikh of Koweit only Rs.3 per ton for royalty and tax exemption taken together. Mr.Hearn pointed out that the other terms contemplated were much more generous than at Bahrein. Mr.Laithwait« remarked however that the Bahrein Petroleum Company had now agreed toa substantial increase in the original Bahrein terms. Mr. Starling said that he did not hold any brief xor the Rs.3.8.0* royalty, but there was also the important point that the Company proposed to pay the Koweit royalty on oil exported and sold instead of on oil produced^ The royalty payment would have to be considered in the light oi this. Mr.Laithwaite suggested that the Sheikh might well ask for advice on the question of paying royalty on oil exported and sold instead of on oil produced, and Mr* 3 barling added tha it/it had axready appeared during the negotiations that the Sheikh was well aware of the difference between the two methods of calculation. ■Mr. dal ton thanked the Company’s representatives for providing copies of the financial terms. His Majesty’s Government would now he able to consider them with a view to advising the Sheikh. In reply to a question by Mr.Stevens, Mr.Walton said that the India Office had had no news from Koweit about the Company’s negotiations except as regards the question of the appointment of the Chief Local Representative, the position in regard to which had been ex-plained in his letter of 13th October to Mr,Fraser (p.Z.6333/34). Mr.Stevens then reverted to the terms of Mr.Walton’s letter of 13th October to Mr.Kemp (P.Z.63S5/34) and suggested that, as it stood, it might mean that His Majesty’s Government reserved the right to say vdiat the financial terms of the Concession should be, which would be taking the commercial negotiations out of the hands of the Company and the Sheikh. Mr.Laithwaite explained that His Majesty’s Government had no such intention. They had a responsibility to the Sheikhs in these matters. They could not, for e xample, allow an ignorant Sheikh to accept terms which were obviously against his own interests. In c ei tain circumstances His Majesty’s Government might have to advise a Sheikh in a matter of this kind whether the Sheikh asked for their advice or not. Mr.Stevens was quite satisfied with this explanation, and asked whether the India Office could let the Company have a letter explaining that what they desired was merely to be in a position to advise the Sheikh. It was agreed that the India Office should send a letter to the Company putting it on record that they had receivedcopies 01 the minimum financial terms which:the Company’s negotiators had been authorised to offer the Sheikh and stating that they would like to he advised of any change in these teims in order that they might he in a position, if necessary, to advise the Sheikh regarding them.P.z. 6645/34. vmY CONFIDENTIAL KUWAIT OIL COMPANY LIMITED.

He explained that the Sheikh might ask for the advice of H.M.G. on the financial terms and that H.M*G. must be in a position to give him an opinion on the matter. Mr. Starling reminded the Company’s representatives that the obligations imposed on the Company/Company in Article 2 of the Concession a® regards drilling operations were very lenient and that the financial terms would have to be considered in relation to this, Er.

He—axplained that-j^n certain circumstances H.lt.G. might have to advise a Sheikh in a matter Mr. Stevens was quite satisfied with this explanation, and asked whether the India Office could let the Company have a letter explaining that what they desired was merely to be in a position to advise the Sheikh. It was agreed that the j.ndie Office should send a letter to the Company putting it on record that they had received copies of theffInancial terms which the Company's negotiators had been authorised to offer the fs. :h and stating that they would lijce to be advised of any change in these terms in order that they might be in a position, if necessary, to advise the Sheiklwv^u^ V^T~. of this kind whether?roni: - To : ~ Copy to Copy to .y-j ■ Political Agent, Kuwait, Political Resident, Bushire.

Copies of this letter and of the shaikh’s reply are enclosed. 2. As this reply was altogether unsatisfactory, I went and saw the Shaikh this morning. His Excellency who looked particularly glum directly the expression ’Chief Local Representative’ was mentioned, declared the matter had never been really settled, that it stood where it was when the point had been raised in April in discussions with Colonel 1 okson and that he claimed he should be given the right of choosing the Chief Local representative subject to the final approval of His Majesty’s Government, I pointed out that the matter had not been discussed fur- ther as it was considered that as a result of His Excellency giving his approval in writing to the Political Agreement concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the Company, the question of the method of appointment Of the Chief Local Representative had, under the terms of para 4 of that agreement, automatically been settled, the ahaikh tacitly admitted that this statement expressed the situation correctly as he replied that under these cir- | oumstances he would, in the coming negotiations with thewith the Company’s representatives, avoid all discussion of this subject and that if and when the concession was granted to them he would come to some proper understanding with His Majesty’s Government in the matter. I then asked him to explain what this understanding would be and the bhaikh once more declared he would make some arrangement with the Company whereby he would nominate the Chief Local Representative and submit the individual’s name for the final approval of His Majesty’s Government. I pointed out that the Company could not enter into any such arrange ment in view of the Political Agreement entered into by them and reminded the bhaikh once more that he had approved of that agreement and that the only interpretation that could be put on Clause 4 was that the final approval of the Chief Local Representative had to remain in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. I went on to explain in the terms of para 3 of Secretary of State’s t legram referred to above, that in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding in the future on this point His Majesty’s Government had wished me to approach His Excellency and point out that the question of the final appointment of Chief Local Represen tative had by reason of -the Shaikh’s acceptance of the Political Agreement been left in the hands of His Majesty’s Government but that they wished at the same time to assure him that they would not approve of any appointment to the post without first consulting him and would give great weight to his wishes. His Excellency’s reply was that until he had actually given the concession he preferred not to discuss the matter as it was quite possible that the Kuwait Oil Company would not accept his terms and in that case he would not give them or any other Company the concession. Under these circumstances the Shaikh declared he saw no use at this stage in discussing the point about the method of appointing a Chief Local Representative. 4./3 4* I ss.id that the only desire oi* T Iis Majesty f s government in this mat her of the Chief Local Representative which was a political and not a commercial one, was to clear up a possible misunderstanding in the future in the interests of the Shaikh and themselves. Shaikh then replied that as negotiations were about to be resumed in a few days in Kuwait, he would prefer not to go on with this particular question of the Chief Local Representative just now, that he would not discuss it at all with the Company’s representatives but that if eventually he did give the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company he would then write in to the Political Agent and formally agree that the method of appointment of the Chief Local Representative should be as mentioned in my letter to him of October 4th. 5. The Shaikh’s whole attitude - particularly at this interview - on the question of the appointment of a Chief Local Representative affords, I consider, good grounds for believing that he has made certain promises to some unknown person or persons at whose identity, however, it is not difficult to make a guess i.e. Major Holmes and/or confederates 6. Just before leaving I casually remarked that as His Excellency did now in effect agree with the attitude of His Majesty’s Government as regards the method of appointment of the Chief Local Representative, it would finish the matter once and for all if he would reply accordingly to my letter in substitution of his last received. His Excellency declared, however, that he gave his word of honour that once the concession wrs given he would act as he had already promised and that nothing further was therefore now needed. 7. I think the Shaikh will not go back on his word and the question may now be considered practically settled.

The question of the method of appointing the Chief Local Representative is therefore really settled. As had already been explained to Your excellency His Majesty*a Government would however giv© the fullest consideration to Your xce Honey* a wishes in approving of any appointment, 3. In order to make it quite clear that in the appoint* ment of a Chief Local Representative the wishes of v our Excellency shall not be disregarded His Majesty’s Government have uow authorised me to give Your Excellency a written assurance that they will not approve of any appointment to the post of Jhief Local Representative referred to in their agree ment with the Company signed on March 5th 1934 without first consulting Your Excellency and that they will naturally give great weight to Your Excellency’s wishes. The natter having been dealt with in the Govo.rument agreement which Your i.: cell one y has approved and in this sup plementary assurance.| there is* therefore* no need in the negotiations between Your jixcellency and the Company for any further discussion of the question of the method of approving th© appointment.

I agree with you, for the reasons you state, that the appointment of an American as the London representative of the Shaikh is not a point which we would be well advised to object to, if the Shaikh sees fit to make such a choice. You will remember that we reserved the right to examine the financial provisions which are to be inserted in the Concession and in view of the small drilling obligations which at present appear in the Concession this should not be overlooked.

The word 'London' has been deleted before 'Representative' in the seventh line. Article_6. (a) The phraseology of this clause is that which was agreed at our meeting on 17th September. (B) and (c) . The principles remain unaltered, but the wording has been changed.1 •n-.. / pf 4.^iP Al * The last sentence has been revised in order to make^it clear that the payment contemplated is in lieu of taxation payments® Article 9, Article 17® Article 20. In the first paragraph, line 10, the words 'with the cognisance of the Shaikh' have been inserted because the Shaikh expressed a wish for a provision to which these words give effect. The second sentence of this Article was inserted by agreement between the Shaikh and the negotiators® On their return from Kuwait in June last the negotiators informed us that the Shaikh had asked for the insertion of a measurement clause on certain lines. The article as now inserted is a modification of the draft put forward by the Shaikh. Since the foregoing amendments are purely commercial, we presume the Departments will not'take exception to them. Should this not be the case, however, I should be much obliged if you could give me early notification.Draft 5.

IN THE PRESENCE OF IN THE PRESENCE OFv^ioh reference to the point raised by the Coy. on 13th September, a draft telegram is submitted, authorising a letter to the Sheikh in the sense proposed at the meeting with the Coy. and Colonel Fowle on 17th September. The Coy. vail in due coarse propose for the commercial agreement a clause in the sense of the first sentence of Mr. Stevens’s proposal marked A on the sheet below. As regards the possibility that the Sheikh may criticise this on account of its difference from Art. 4 of the Govt, agreement and the assurance now to be given, Colonel Fowle suggests that the most convenient procedure will be to wait till this contingency arises before instructing the Political Agent how to deal with it. It wrirl in any case have to—be rlnnlt wita-a-n a second letter, as the contingency will not arise till after the Coy.’s negotiators have returned to Koweit, and, moreover, it may not arise m exactly the way which we anticipate.

Department. Under Secretary of State It will be remembered that the difficulties seen by the Shaikh of Koweit in connection with Articles llA(d) and 20 of the draft Commercial Agreement were overcome by removing the Articles in question from the Agreement and embodying them in a confidential exchange of letters. The Company agreed at the time formally to accept an arrangement of this nature as binding upon them and further to give effect to a stipulation made by the Shaikh that the correspondence should not be published and that H. , should obtain a written assurance from the Company to this effect. The letter now received from the Company meets our requirements and those of the Shaikh fully. Mr. Kemp in a recent interview mentioned that the American directors of the Company were anxious to put it on record that if any leakage took place of the contents of the correspondence, it would not be their fault since they intended to take every precaution to guard against this. The object of fe'frirg addition was to N 1 1 I safeguard them in the event of any leakage in Koweit (through Major Holmes or otherwise). It was pointed out to Mr. Kemp that the Shaikh would be likely to misunderstand a proviso of this kind and the suggestion was made to him that, if the American directors wished to pursue the matter, it could best be disposed of by a d.o. letter from the Company to the India Office, setting out their views, to which a d.o. reply could be sent by this Office, l^c. ^ I attach a formal reply to the Kuwait Oil Company’s present letter. ^ ^ £ C/U. ««-*»« &amp; fjfa fX y V 2621 6000 3/34c .-la —'-. 1 Draft Paper.

The general position was discussed today with Colonel Dickson; Mr. Walton, Mr. Laithwaite, Mr.Stevens, Mr. Fraser, Mr. Lefroy and Mr. Hearn being present. Colonel Dickson answered questions put by representatives of the Company and gave his impressions of the Sheikh’s attitude and the atmosphere of Koweit. The main points which emerged, after considerable discussion, were: (a) Colonel Dickson explained Arab mentality in general and the Sheikh’s psychology in particular, laying stress on his sensitive pride, suspiciousness, shrewdness and knowledge of the world. (b) That Major Holmes, whatever his faults, had g:re at influence with the Sheikh and was very skilful in his handling of him. From that point of view it would probably be difficult to find a better negotiator, though the possibility that he might put the interests of the Sheikh before those of the Company and that his own interests would not be overlooked would have to be borne in mind. (c) On the whole it would probably be better, therefore, that Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm should return to continue the negotiationsin September. (d) They could anticipate, so far as Colonel Dickson could judge, a friendly reception by the Sheikh on their return. The Sheikh’s desire to be rid of the negotiators was partly due to genuine tiredness and irritation: he had many other important questions to concern himat the moment.—mil n n % (e) The Company thought they could probably go some way further to meet the Sheikh. Colonel Dickson suggested that they should be frank in explaining their objections to his demands; the Sheikh was a very shrewd and capable negotiator, in a different category, so far as ability and business acumen went, from tfye other Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf, and could be relied on to see through any bluff. The only sound course was to be straightforward with him. If the Company, e.g # could not meet him fully over the question of 'oil won and used' their best course would be to give him a full and convincing explanation of the reasons. In other directions the further they went to meet him the better. It was undesirable in the same connection, to present him with an ultimatum or to rush matters too much. The Sheikh needed careful handling and now that he realised (in Colonel Dickson T s words) that his horse was apparently so valuable was in less of a hurry to sell it than he might have been earlier.

The Shaikh at first took up his old stand about himself h&amp;Ting the right to designate the Chief Local Representative in the first place, end His Majesty’s Government having the right to veto his selection, and he pressed me to say why His Majesty’s Government concerned themselves when clearly the matter was one between himself and the Company alone. 4. In reply I showed him para 4 (in English and Arabic) of the Political Agreement, the wording of which clearly required the Company to designate the Chief Local Representative themselves, and get the approval of His Majesty’s Government afterwards. I pointed out that Article 4 made it Impossible for either the Company or His Majesty’s Government to permit him (the Shaikh) to designate the Chief Local Representative himself. 5. My argument seemed at long last to impress the Shaikh (who I really do not hink has ever properly readn read the 1 olit i cal Agreeraent) for after some farther argaments he proposed the folloidng M formuha tf or 'doorway^ as he called it, for settling the matter to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government and the Company: (a) lie Company’s Representatives to visit him and shc^r him para 4 of the Political Agreement, confidential copies of which they and he already possessed. (b) r Ih© Company*s Representatives, next to infom him that it quite impossible for them to agree to his (Shaikh’s) selecting the Chief Local Representative, as he apparently wished to do, as such action would be tantamount to their breaking their Agreement with His Majesty’s Government of March 5 th. (c) His Axcelloncy (the Shaikh) would see and agree to this, and both he and the Company’s Representatives would then set to work to draw up a formula based on Article 4 of the Political Agreement, or possibly in almost the same words, for insertion as Article 6 (A) of the Oomereial Agreement • 6 . Th© Shaikh himself pointed out that he had already officially intimated his approval of the Political I Agreement, and ipso facto of Article 4 to me in writing on 13th April 1934, so could use this fact as a 'face saver” with the Company’s Representatives. 7. As the Shaikh has also signified his approval of the contents of th© draft letter (©specially para 3 (b)), sent out under Secretary of State for India’s telegram No.ISiilLof 19th May, later delivered to the Shaikh officially by m t (See my telegram No. 195 of 28th May) it seems to me that the question of the Chief Local Representative has practically settled itself, and that5 - 14-1 ana that th© shaikh also now appreciates this. S. jor formalities* sake however he would like the Company's representatives (negotiators) to face him with para 4 of the Political Agreement, as suggested by him above, a© that he can withdraw from his formr position in graceful manner under some such excuse a® 'if you had showed me this para before and pointed out your awkward predicament, X, of course, would not have taken the line ' in once again, I fear a case of pride and 'Amour propre' with him. 9* Though the shaikh*® plan is somewhat cumbersome, I suggest it be acted upon, especially as it mmm from him, mid promise© success. I suggest therefore that the Company*» representatives (Holmes and Chisholm) be immediately told to go ahead on the lines proposed. X could do this myself if you see no objection* K). It Is necessary that we should act quickly, I think, ©s the Shaikh told me that he definitely proposed inf aiming holmes and Chisholm on Saturday and June that unless they could agree to his Commercial terms within the next ID days, he did not want to see them again till the md of the hot weather, and that the best thing they could do was to go horn© to London and report th© situation. (I see ifolmes* hand in this), and on th© excuse that th© weather was too hot for work, he {the shaikh) would 'give them his word' not to listen to any other competitors until they returned in the Autumn.

The Coy’s, representatives gave information of the reply received from their representative at Koweit to the telegram which was sent to the latter after the meeting at the 1 . 0 . on 12 th oune. The reply intimated that the Sheikh had been much annoyed by the further approach made to him, and had threatened to withdraw his undertaking to give the Coy. a period of grace till September to decide on his terms, unless the representatives withdrew forthwith to consult their principals in London. Major Holmes has already left for London, and the telegram stated that Mr.Chisholm would do so on Sunday. The Coy. was undecided as to its course of action, Mr.L e froy b eing in favour of allowing Mr.Chisholm to come home, Mr.Stevens inclining to the view that he should be directed to remain. As in view of the apparent attitude of the Sheikh, it did not seem that any good purpose would be served by Mr.Chisholm remaining, it is understood that the Coy. will probably cdecide to allow him to return on Sunday as he intends.-.ijj li OIL c ^ discussion took pluce at tne India Cilice on 12th June.

The negotiators strongly urged in these circumstances that unless the Company was prepared to accede to the Sheikh's demands in full they should at once he withdrawn. 2. The Company said that in these circumstances they thought the right course was to wire withdrawing Major Holmes, leaving Mr. Chisholm to hold the fort in Koweit. There was admittedly the risk of a request from the Sheikh that Mr. Chisholm should also leave Koweit. If this should happen they would not, however, propose to withdraw him farther than to Ahadan. 3. Mr. Warner enquired whether it would not he possible to meet the sneikh by withdrawing both, and one or more principals going out to discuss matters with them en route and thereafterthe negotiations in tne light of the discussion. The Company, however, remained of opinion that tne course they advocated was the right one, and in the light-of discussion Sir Louis Kershaw agreed. They undertook also not to remove Mr. Chisholm without consultation with H.M.G. 4. It may oe added that Mr. Fraser indicated that if the Company^ suspicions of Major Holmes proved to he well-founded, he would not return to Koweit. They thought it desirable, however, in the telegraphic instructions they were sending hingto state that he was being recalled for a brief period of consultation only and would be required to return as early as possible. If in the light of their discussion they saw reason to take a different course they would of course be at liberty to do so.— - 1 -—- Si &lt;■* l v fttxsjLch# £0.

Mr. Fraser said that the commercial aspect of the negotiations was not so satisfactory. The Company had received from' their negotiators in Koweit a copy of a revised concession (Draft Ho. 4) which the Sheikh was willing to sign but which included some proposals to which the Company could not agree. Mr. Fraser read out a telegram which they had just received from their negotiators (confirming the information given in Bushire telegram Ho. 0 of 7th June) to the effect that the Sheikh said that unless the Company accepted Draft Ho. 4 in to to, he would not be prepared to discuss the matter further with them at present and that their negotiators should be withdrawn from Koweit until the 24 FROM 11D. • f , sacntn , i COPY SENT CY AIR MAIL end/ 14-JUN, IbM of bjfy- k COPY SEix \ l-y AIR MAIL of ^ •2. end of September. Meanwhile the Sheikh would undertake not to discuss a concession with any other Company. The reasons given by mne Sheikh for this attitude were (1) the approacn ox the hot weather at Kuweit; (d) pressing business which needed his attention and which was being held up by the oil negotiations; and ( 5 ) tllat 13116 outstanding points could only be settled if the Company’s negotiators talked to their principals personally in London and explained the Sheikh’s attitude to them, he was nor satisfied that it had been made clear. The Company felt that it was difficult to oppose the Sheikh’s wishes. S, i -)-. Louis h.81*iav : f enquired what were the noints outstanding between the Sheikh and the Company. E£j:. anci Mr. Stevens agreed that the financial points had been virtually settled. In the revised draft ox the concession the Sheikh had, ho?/ever ? altered the basis of the payment of royalty so that instead of being paid only on oi] * -Q^ffQ^ted from Koweit it would be paid on all oil ftT ££B„ a nd saved”. Mr. Fraser said that this would mean an increase of about 15 to 20 $ in the value of the royalties. A more important difficulty was that the Sheikh insisted on having a representative in London at a salary of not less tnan £1800 a year (to be paid by the Company) for a period 12 years, on the expiry of which he would be replaced by a Sector representing the Sheikh. This demand of the Sheikh was most objectionable. Sir Louis Kershaw asked whether the Company knew what made this point so important to the Sheikh, and what particular intention he had in insisting on it at this stage? Mr./o ^ ir ..^ s .gH saia that Trom the Sheikh’s oto point ot Tis»v he did no u see vvnau peaoon he could have fop his insistence.

For example, their negotiators, without the consent of the Company, had presented a new draft concession to the Sheikh embodying proposals which the Company did not approve and providing for the appointment by the Sheikh on quite unacceptable ■terms of a representative in London. Asked who the. Sheikh had in mind for this lucrative post, and whether it would not be well to provide that its incumbent should be a Ido we it i, the negotiators had first sent an obscure reply, and on being pressed had intimated that the Sheikh had issued his ultimatum. It was also relevant that eheir negotiators had originally said that it was the .Political situation which was holding up negotiations and that it would be better for them to withdraw from Koweit for the present. The Company, after consultation with His Majesty’s Government, had told them to keep out of the political situation and not to leave Koweit. thereupon they had received this latest telegram from Koweit/f4t &gt; .ivO -iq it, mix cii almost seemed to confim their suspicions informing them that the Sheihh himself said that their negotiators must go. Mr. Stevens said that Major Holme nad apparently established himself in tie Sheikh’s good graces and ne nad constantly asserted that the Sheikh wanted the concession to be negotiated by him (Major Holmes) and to let nim (major Holmes) get something out of it* All this looked extremely shady, yet apparently Mr. Chisholm, their other negotiator, nad concurred in the terns of the latest telegram from itoweit and in the reading of the Sheikh f s attitude which ip gave.

Mr. rraser agreed that the Company were faced with the alternatives suggested.

The negotiators informed the Sheikh, on the instructions of the Company, that the Company were unable to accept the revised Draft No. 4 , referred to in the Note of an interview with Mr. Stevens and hr. Lefroy of 28th May ( P.z. 3620/34), in its existing iorm, though the modifications involved were such as they hoped His Excellency would see no objection to accepting. The Sheikh in reply stated that he was not prepared to have any further discussion and that unless the Company would agree to accept the draft exactly as it stood the natter must lapse. He was much occupied with other affairs and would prefer to Intermit the discussions until after the hot weather ana resume them in September. Meanwhile, the Company's negotiators could return to London and inform their principals of his point of view, which he was not satisfied had been fully put before them, with a view to sumption of discussions. Pending their resumotion he would agree not to entertain overtures from any other Quarter or to give any other concession. 11:16 Company in these circumstances saw little option but to recall Major Holmes ana Mr. Chisholm for aiscussion, as proposed, but were considerin &amp; the matter further. ~~ COPY t . a...

Mr. Kemp informed me that the difficulty over the Chief Local Representative was not the only one. The Company took a very serious view of the revised demands now put forward by the Sheikh in regard to the computation of royalty (paragraph 3) which, if accepted, might result in the Company's being liable in certain circumstances for an increase of some 20 % in their royalty payments. They also regarded the revised provisions in the matter of the Sheikh's representative in London as quite unacceptable. J.G. LAITHWAITE. 7th June 1934.K 0 WE 1 T on,.

I We are glad to learn that the Shaikh has accepted the exchange of letters proposed, and have taken note of his stipulation. We likevd.se find no objection in the Shaikh 1 s stipulations, and we shall be prepared when asked officially by you to do so to give an assurance of the nature he suggests. The assurance which we can give will be that as far as the Company is concerned the contents of the letter shall be kept separate and not attached to the Concession proper, and that the letter shall not be published by the Company. It is obvious that we can give no effective guarantee against leakage, since only a few of the possible points of leakage are within our control. It is of course in no way in the interests of the Kuwait Oil Company that the terms of the letter or even its existence should be published. Yours sincerely. P.S. attached.£iS.^ As I informed you on the telephone this morning, we have heard from our negotiatiors in Kuweit that the Shaikh has intimated to them that unless we are prepared to accept Draft 4 (of which' I left you a copy) in toto, he does not vd.sh to continue discussions at present, but wishes them postponed until next September or a later convenient date. Pending a renewal of discussions the Shaikh has said that he will not entertain or discuss any offers from other parties, and he wishes the negotiators to return to London to explain verbally and more successfully to us his point of view. In these circumstances we are instructing the negotiators to return to London, after writing a letter to the Shaikh agreeing to suspend discussions in accordance with his wishes and his undertaking not to negotiate with.others in the meanwhile.Kowelt Oil . Colonel Fowle 1 s telegram of 31st toy is very satisfactory. I see no objection to the stipulation suggested hy the Sheikh, It is to he hoped that, despite tajor Holmes* activities, serious difficulty will not arise over the Question of the Chief Local Representative. I have given the substance of the Resident*s telegram hy telephone to Mr. Lefroy and will, if you agree, confirm it in the letter attached, we need not, I think, send an official letter at this stage to ask for the Company*s written assurance regarding the non- publication of the letter to the Sheikh. 3* Mr. Lefroy, who is naturally well pleased at disposing of this difficulty, mentioned that the Company had had a telegram from Messrs. Holmes and Chisholm in which they said that the sheikh has invited them to a discussion on Saturday morning^(which they will report by telegraph to the Companyjron the various points on which the Company have asked for further Information from/- 2 - xrom them.

INDIA OFFICE. P 3620/34. KOWEIT OIL ISz\ Stevens and, ivir. Lefroy called to discuss the position with Sir Louis Kershaw on the 28th May. They were anxious to ascertain whether any further report had been received from Koweit, and to consult us on certain developments reported by their own representatives. i^Q Company were informed that we had had no report as yet from Colonel Dickson as to the sheikh's reaction to the letter which the Political Agent had been instructed to despatch to him in our telegram of 19th Play, No.1321. There seemed, however, no reason to draw any adverse inference from this fact. The letter would take time to translate and it would probably be unwise to rush the discussion of matters such as it dealt with. The Company agreed. 3„ Asked whether they on their side had any information to give, the Company's representatives stated that they had received from their representatives a copy of a draft (now attached) which had, without authorisation from the Company, been submitted to the sheikh, and which embodied certaha alterations, some of which were unacceptable to the Company. In particular the revise included a redraft of Article 6 on the subject of the ■ Chief Local Representative, which was not only unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Company, but which, so far as H.M.G* were concerned, included a provision that the selection and the appointment of the Chief Local Representative should rest entirely with the Sheikh in consultation with H.M.G. The negotiators had reported that they had embodied this redraft in the draft Agreement in the light of a statement by the Sheikh that it represented what had been agreed between him and H.M.G. (through/ ' ( s(through the Resident). They admitted that the Political Agent had informed them that no decision had yet been reached, hut felt that they had no option hut to accept the sheikh's statement. 4 ‘ slr Loui s Kershaw expressed great surprise that the Company's representatives should have committed themselves in any way to a proposition of this nature. The Company were not concerned with the political aspects of this question, hut solely with the commercial aspects. Tne position of H.M.G. in regard to the selection and appointment of the Chief Local Representative had already been made quite clear to the Company; and we had informed Colonel Dickson on 19th May that we could not agree to relax our requirements on this point, we would consult the Sheikh and give him every opportunity of making any observations that occurred to him, but the last wort must rest with H.M.G. A clause of the nature suggested was not only open to the strongest objections from the standpoint of H.M.G., but appeared also to be objection able from the point of view of the Company. The Company's representatives expressed entire agreement. 5- T* 19 Company's representatives went on to say that Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm had strongly urged that they should be allowed to return to London to discuss matters. The psychological effect on the sheikh would be good, and even if the Company could make no further concession, His Excellency would feel that no stone had been left unturned. They were anxious to know what we thought of this. They were informed in reply that on the face of it there seemed nothing to be gained, on the assumption that no further concessions were to be made, by a/30th Play 1934.

They said that that had been their own vnew, and after further discussion it was understood that they would make it clear to Ivlajor Holmes and Mr* Chisholm that the Company could not agree to a special visit to London, and that they considered that the commercial negotiations should he disposed of with the. minimum of delay as soon as the political points (which were solely matters between H#M.G• and the Sheikh)had been settled* It is understood that Mr* Stevens and Mr. Lefroy might, in the event of the political difficulties being removed but no conclusion appearing possible to the commercial negotiations, consider vis-uting Koweit themselves. They did not, however, propose to indicate this to their representatives.This is an AGREEMENT made at Kuwait on the in the year 193 corresponding to day of 135 between His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al - Jabir as - Subah, Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire and Companion of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, The SHAIKH OF KUWAIT in the excercise of his powers as Ruler of Kuwait on his own behalf and in the name of and on behalf of his heirs and successors in whom is or shall be vested for the time being the responsibility for the control and government of the State of Kuwait ( here inafter called “ the Shaikh” ) and the KUWAIT OIL COMPANY LIMITED a Company registered in Great Britain under the Companies Act, 1929, its successors and assigns ( hereinafter called “ The Company ” ).

Messrs Holmes and Chisholm (the latter of whom »as absent in Basra on 1st May) visited me on 2nd May, and reported the receipt of the above letter and also furnished ®a with a translation.

Major Holmes expressed the opinion that the Shaikh was being pressed Airman outside quarter, and so had decided to force an early issue with the huvraic Oil Company. He mentioned that he had Inner Information that the Shaikh had received two further telegrams frc» the strange company whom he suspected to be the This may or may not be true. 4 . Major Holjnss added that what worried him at this f all was the new attitude of the shaikh.

This of course was all said in confidence. 0. *;.$ I hrvu el-ee.dy said in my telegram under refer ence, X take a carious view of the Hirlkh* s letter and the situation generuHry, ^tioh soeras to have taken a turn for the worse in the last week. In my opinion unless the Kuwait Oil Company walk very warily, I should xiot be sur prised if the haikh-were to break off negotiations. 7. X am pretty sure in my own mind now, that His La jes ty ’ s Gov e m me nt ? s to. eseagc re Clau see 11 a (d) and 20 of the draft Commercial .Agreement, which I was ordered to deliver had a most unfortunate effect of the shaikh’s mind. He became furiously suspicious, and from a subsequent con versation which 1 had with him he seems to have got it into his head that heis in process of being bullied by a com bination of the Kuwait Oil Company in London and His Majesty! Hovornnont, and he probably is determined in his own mine not to submit to further pressure. The trouble is that we are once again up against Arab pride, and a i&amp;lse movu,. fy may easily cause the Shaikh^ decide to break with the ^uweit Oil Company for f^ood.

The matter has since been discussed in detail with the Sheikh by the Political Resident and Colonel Dickson. The Sheikh's difficulties are not, however, met by any of the suggestions referred to in the preceding paragraph and he has himself now put forward the proposal as an alternative that he should receive a confidential letter from the Political Agent, a copy of which could be given to the Company. The confidential letter would textually embo'dy Clauses llA(d) and 20 of the Commercial Agreement and would in addition contain Clause l£B(a) of that Agreement from •'all land granted*' down to •good order and repair', prefaced by the words 'It is understood that in the event of the agreement between Your Excellency's Government and the Company being terminated thereby'. (As we understand it, the object of the proposed inclusion of this portion of Clause 12B(a) is to cover the position of the lands, buildings and other immovable property of the Company in the event of the determination of the agreement under the/the provisions of Clause liACd)). The letter would further allude ta the fact that the sheikh had agreed verbally to its contents and ask for written confirmation of this, and would refer to the fact that it was open to h.M.g. to give a copy confidentially to the Company. 3. H.M.G. are anxious so far as possible to meet the Sheikh and as nothing is involved in the substance of the proposed exchange of letters In which the Company have not already expressed ^ e: i£/^ 0 • G z CU ^ rence, the y assume that the Company/^wUT see no difficulty in concurring in it. On the other hand, as will be observed, the mere despatch by the Political Agent to the Sheikh of a letter such as His Excellency suggests, a copy of which would subsequently be communicated to the Company, would not necessarily bind the Company,; and H.M.G. are naturally anxious to have this point covered beyond question. 4. H.M.G. suggest in these circumstancesi that the best course would be, if the Company agree, that the Company, in reply to the present letter, should officially intimate their concurrence in the despatch by the Political Agent to the Sheikh of a letter in the terms of tne draft enclosed and their formal readiness to accept as binding on the Company the contents of such a latter. The draft varieslightly slightly from that proposed hy the Sheikh, notably in specifically relating the extract from Clause l2B(a) to the .circumstances covered by clause UA(d); in intimating that the Company concur in the statements made in it; and in offering to obtain a reaffirmation of that concurrence on receipt of H.£.‘s reply, m the event of the Company accepting this suggestion instructions would he sent to the Political Agent on receipt of their formal reply, authorising him to make a communication to the Sheikh in the terms of the draft enclosed, copies of the correspondence exchanged between the Political Agent and the Sheikh would on receipt be communicated officially to the Company, when the Company would reply acknowledging and reaffirming its previous acceptance. That reaffirmation would then be officially communicated to the Sheikh by H.M.G. The effect of the correspondence taken as a whole would be tantamount to the inclusion of the Clauses in the Commercial Agreement and equally binding on the Company. 5. It will be appreciated that the P.A. on receipt of the draft enclosed, or after discussion with the Sheikh, may wish to suggest alterations in it. In the event of any materialalteration being proposed tbe consent of the Company would, of course, be obtained before the actual communication was made to the Sheikh.7 1 Draft letter* from Political Agent, Koweit * to the Sheikh of Koweit After compliments. I have discussed with Your Excellency certain points arising out of the^agreementTor the grant of an oil concession in respect of Koweit territory, which is in process of / negotiation between Your Excellency and the Koweit Oil Company. Your Excellency also referred to the fact that an agreement, of which I attach a copy and in the terms of which ^ r ° u fo ave concurr ed, has been concluded between the Koweit Oil Company and H.M.G. We have discussed what would happer^ in th-o ov-ont of you|j decid£^ to grant a/concession to the Koweit Oil Company^in the following event si - (a) If the Koweit Oil Company shall fail to observe any of the terms of the agreement between the Company and signed in London on the 5th March 1954, referred to above, and if the matter is ref&amp;Tred to arbitration under Article 18 of thed&amp; commercial agreement with ti 1 ‘ J Your Excellency/T f^il to remedy such failure within the reasonable time which shall befixed by the arbitrators for so doing. (b) Should any of the terns of the commercial agreement between Your Excellency and the Koweit Oil Company be inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of the agreement between the Company and H.M.G. signed in London on the 5th March 1934. I have now to inform Your Excellency that in the event described in (a) above, then in that case in the cases mentioned in Article 11 of the coranercial 'agreement! between the Koweit Oil Company and Your Excellency aaad in no other, |the Company agree thatf Your Excellency will be entitled to terminate the commercial agreement, and all the property of the Company within the State of Koweit shall become the property of the Sheikh. In the events described in (b) above, the commercial agreement between Your Excellency and the Koweit Oil Company will, to the extent of any such inconsistencies and conflicts, be subordinate to or controlled by the terms of the agreement between the Company and H.M.G, signed in Londonon the 5th 1954. Your Excellency has also Invited me to say what the position will be in the event of the agreement between Your Excellency and the Company being terminated in the circumstance! described in (a) above, in regard to the land granted to the Company by the Sheikh and any lands or buildings which the Company may have obtained, and any houses or buildings constructed by, and other immovable property of, the Company within the State of Koweit. In reply I have to inform you that in such circumstances the Company agree that such lands, buildings. houses and other immovable property will be handed over to the Sheikh free of cost, and that producing wells and borings will be handed over in reasonably good order and repair Your Excellency has intimated, after discussion with me, that you understand the nature of the arrangements as set out above. and that you are prepared to agree to them.Sir L. Kershaw, I have spoken to Mr. starling, who concurs in the course of action suggested by you as regards Koweit oil. Mr. Stevens has since rung me up. i explained what we had in mina and he replied that there was nothing between H.M.G. and the Company, who would he only too glad to fall in with any procedure which we thought advisable within the limits of what had already been agread.

The Shaikh than turned to points (a), (b) and (c) of the ^.aoretary of otatee telegram under reference, and I give belovr and in saw detail his reactions, lallnsertlon of ^ grtloles 11(A) (di md gr r The shaikh said that im had nothing whatsoever to say against the Articles in themselves, but felt strongly that the insertion in his commercial Agreemant, which bo published to ,lLe.JiO£ld, of any clauses making TOntion^gf jds^Ji ajesty's i&gt;overniaeat by name, especially when such suggested that ultimate control of the concession lay wilt his ...a jeety ■ a -ovemment, would gravely prejudice his good name and prestige in the eyes of fellow Arab Rulers &amp;&amp;&lt;i would almost be interpreted as the signing away of his independence* Nor would His Majesty’s Government’s good name for fair dealing escape criticism. He (the Shaikh) would become the laughing stock of Bin baud and othei^ who would say 'Brother Ahmad Is not allowed to make even a simple commercial agreement with a foreign business firm, without the British stepping in and forcing him to insert aertaiii Qyyoiu leave clauses'. lie had no objection to His Majesty’s Government 'tying him up', as much as she chose, both in the Political Agreement or by other secret document, that he feared was j)ubllci ty of such control clauses. He had promised and would again premia© to show the commercial Agreement as finally agreed upon between himself and the Kuwait Oil Company, to Hi® Majesty’s Government, before he actually put his signature to it, therefore it seemed to him that Hi® Majesty’s Govemreent could perfectly easily and definitely inmre that no offending clause, would get into the commercial Agreement, which would conflict in any way with their Political Agreement. Surely this was enough« He begged and trusted that His Majesty ’ s Government N/ would und or stand his standpoint, which was one ax i acting his 'Sharaf” (pride or honour) and which in no way affected his/8*/ his loyalty, or his desire to please His Majesty 'a Government.

The negotiators had clearly misunderstood him, *aid the Shaikh* All that he had wished to insure (in making said the Shaikh his verbal request to the negotiators) was that he should not be rough shod over” (his words) and that a person who was ignorant of the Arabic language, or Arab Customs or was actually a .grata to himself, should not be appointed as the Company’s local Representative* Ee merely desired that the selection of such louts! Representative should be made by His Majesty’s Government and the Company in full consultation with himself, and that if he did not like a man or conversely liked a particular person, some notice should be taken of his wishes. This, said the Shaikh, was after all his undoubt3d right as Buler of the State and as the ’’grantor of the concession'. from London, purporting to come from an all British concern* The latter had asked permission to op cm negotiations, and but would say that he had replied that he caild not consider the the offer unless negotiations with the Kuwait Oil 1 ompany showed signs of breaking down al together. 7. The Shaikh again and again reiterated that he was most anxious to come to forms with the Kuwait Oil com pany, as he knew this would pleas© His Majesty’s Government and gl vo them sati sfsetion, hut the Kuwait ' il Company should be told by someone^ not to conduct their nagotiations (as they were doing) on the assumption that ”the^Jiacl elimi nated all oomnetjtorg frea th© _fie ld through hsin&amp; s upp or x ed by His M a.lesty * s Gov q rnmont \his woidb) • ( c) Offer from an oth e r Oil C on wa ny .

Before leaving, I asked the fhaikh if he could not possibly as a personal favour to me and because he knew I wished him well, agree to the insertion of Article 11(A) (d) and BO / or at least one of them. I (rather unfairly perhaps) stressed the fact that by doing so, he would be winning His Majesty’s Government’s entire approbation.

This neglect of the ordinary official courtesy, caused great inconvenience, and was very unfavouraoly commented on by His Excellency the Shaikh in a protest which he made to the writer. On the 7th April a short note was received by the Political Agent from Count Asfar, the French Consular Agent at Basra, enquiring if accommodation for one night would he available for the party either in the Political Agency or His Excellency the Shaikh's guest house. A telegraphic reply in the negative was immediately despatched to the effect that His Excellency the Shaikh was out in camp and his Palace locked up and that ail available accommodation in the Political Agency was taken up by the passengers and officers of the stranded Imperial Airways liner. (See Kuwait Intelligence Summary for Karch, para.IX).

OIL INTERESTS . 15. (i) The Oil negotiations which have since February 22nd of this year been proceeding smoothly between the Kuwait Oil Company and the Shaikh of Kuwait reached somewhat of a deadlock on 12th April. (ii) Apparently on 10th April the Kuwait Oil Company negotiators acting on instructions from their London principals asked the Shaikh to insert two new articles in what is known as the Commercial Agreement, and the Shaikh replied declining to do so. (iii) Had the negotiators made it known that the insertion of the offending articles was hy His Majesty’s Government's wish, matters might not have taken the course they Aid. They did not do this, and out of annoyance and possibly alarm the Shaikh took the step he did. (iv) In the meantiine the Kuwait Oil Company representatives have referred the matter to London for further orders. (v) According to the Kuwait Oil Company's negotiators there are grounds for supposing that another company (possibly the B.O.D.) has approached the Shaikh, or is about to approach him with an offer to negotiate an Oil concession. There may possibly therefore be some connection between such offer (if true) and the recent visit of the German Minister and French Charge d'Affaires from Baghdad to Kuwait. (vi) For the present the writer prefers to think that the Shaikh was bluffing when he told the Kuwait Oil Company/Company representatives (as he did) that he had had an offer from a 100^ British Company to hid against them.Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary for March 1934 (up to 7th April).

A meeting took place at the India Office on 17th April with representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company to discuss the present position of the Company's negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwaf Present : :) ' Sir Louis Kershaw (in the Cha^Lr) Mr.F.C.Starling Petroleum Dept.

INDIA OFFICE )PY SENT BY AIR MAH- of Mr. Stevens produced a telegram which the Company had received from their negotiators in Kuwait (copy attached). The Shaikh had objected to the clauses in the commercial agreement which referred to the agreement between the Company and H.M.G. viz. Article 11 A (d) (providing for cancellation in the event of the Company failing to carry out the terms of the Government agreement) and Article 20 (providing that the commercial agreement should be subordinate to and controlled by the terms of the Government agreement) on the ground that the commercial agreement was separate from the Government agreement and that these clauses were therefore unnecessary. Mr. Stevens suggested that the difficulty might be got over if these two clauses were covered in an agreement betweenbetween the Company and H.M.G. but Sir Louis Kershaw explained that since H.M were not parties to the commercial agreement these sanctions must appear in that agreement. He proposed however that _ . send t e India Office should/instructions for a the Political Agent to explain to the Shaikh the purpose of the Government agreement, point out that the clauses in question were in the Shaikh’s own interest and inform him that H.M.G. would insist on similar clauses in any concession which might he granted by the Shaikh to any Company. With reference to the Shaikh’s economic demands it was explained that these were a matter between the Shaikh and the Company and that H.M.G. were not interested. Mr. Stevens said that as regards financial terms the Shaikh and the Company were not now very far apart. Mr*. Stevens was disturbed by the reference in the telegram from Kuwait to an offer having been made to the Shaikh by a ”10056 British Company”. Mr. Starling did not think that the British Oil Development Company, the British interest in which was about 51 per cent, could be interested in obtaining a concession in Kuwait. It was possible, however, that if the B.O.D. were implicated in the matter the Shaikh might have been misled/&gt; 3 misled by the name of the Company into thinking that it was 100 per cent British. The possibility was discussed of the Eastern and General or the Arabian Oil Development Syndicates having made some offer to the Shaikh. Mr. Stevens said that he felt satisfied that there was no risk of this. _S_ir Louis Kershaw said that H.M.G. had no information of any such offer being made to the Shaikh by any Company other than the Kuwait Oil Company. He assured Mr. Stevens that the consent of H.M.G. would be necessaryy&amp;Jthe grant of a concession by the Shaikh Zr any Company whatever its nationality. There was, however, no objection to the Political Agent being instructed to remind the Shaikh of this. had asked for a Director on the Board of the Kuwait Oil Company in London. He saw great objection to this proposal since, in view of the 50/50 composition of the Board it would give the Shaikh’s Director a deciding voice. Mr. Stevens referred to a suggestion which had already been mentioned to Mr. Walton by Mr# Kemp of the A.P.O.C. that the Shaikh might be invited to pay a visit to this country as the guest of the Kuwait Oil Company. Mr. Stevens was himself of Mr. Stevens said that the Shaikh opinion/(28^ opinion, with which Sir Louis Kershaw agreed, that the Kuwait Oil Company would be going outside their proper sphere in making such an invitation to the Shaikh. Mr. Laithwaite added that an invitation to the Shaikh of Kuwait might embarrass H.M.Gj by encouraging the other Shaikhs to expect similar invitations. Mr.Stevens said that the best solution would probably be to offer the Sheikh a lump sum representing the cost of a visit and leave it to him to do as he thou alterations” in the commercial agreement referred to in the Company^ telegram from Kuwait, Mr. Stevens promised that when these changes, which wereof minor importance, had been finally agreed the agreement would be submitted again to H.M.G. for approval. Mr. Stevens said that the Shaikh was now asking that the Chief Local Representative should be a British subject appointed for five years after consultation with and subject to the approval of the Shaikh himself, whereas in the Company’s agreement with H.M.G. it was laid down that the appointment should be subject to the approval of In answer to an enquiry from Sir Louis Kershaw about the ’’textual Sir / the latterV once telegraph to the Political Resident on the lines of the telegram No, dated f 7 which a copy is attached.

Progress of Kuwait Oil Company’s negotiations.My dear Fowle, of Kuw ait,, Oil Goro.mnv^ s Negotiations. In continuation of my Confidential B.0 # No.C-84 dated She 1st Marek 1934, I am sending this down to you to Bahrain by the hand of Imperial Airways pilot, so that you can get an idea new Chisholm and Holmes have progressed with their new draft 'Conaessioa” since they arrived, 8 . I shall send 4 copies of t Ms direct to Bush ire, and in anticipation of your approval, one copy, under private cover to Laithwaite by destbound air mail so as to give him $ first hand news of what is happening. 3* ns you already Icnow the Kuwait Oil Company submitted their Draft Concession on 3 2nd February and made no progress at all up to the Oth March, the Shaikh showing by his manner, at every interviev/ which took place, that he would disduss nothing until the Company’s representatives talked reason and offered much more attractive terns. f 4. As both Mimes and Chisholm thought that perhaps Shaikh was marking time until the arrival of the ’ ’Political Agreement ' from London, I took the trouble to enquire from him on Qth March vfian he came to see me about some other business, if this was so. 5. The Shaikh assured me that the non-arrival of the Political Agreement was not worrying him much, as he knew that His T'ajesty*s Government had to safeguard both theirs and his interests; what was holding things up was the question of the 'lump sum' to be paid on signature . Tim Kuwait Oil Company must/ The Hon’ble Lt m r r ' ° 13 , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain.''N - 2 - must, he said, offer a reasonable figure, or be would have none of them* There were one or two other small items which he wished to get altered in the Draft Agreement, but these were unimportant as cotapared with the 'lump sma' on signature* 6* The same evening I suggested to Chisholm and Holmes that they mi^it, instead of beating about the bush with the Shaikh, ask him point blank what he wanted and thought a fit -£ij&amp; r Q them to offer, as if they could get that, it would be a distinct advance, on what was happening, and they could then start beating him down to a reasonable figure. 7* They took my advice on Saturday, 10th March, and the Shaikh promised to give them his figures later* B* Yesterday, 13th March, the Shaikh sent for Mohamad Yatim and handed him a sheet of paper for delivery to Holmes and Chisholm containing his terms. These were as follows; (a) Initial payment, Hs.550,000/- instead of Hs.200,000/- offered by Coy. (b) Rental Rs* 120,000/- instead of Rs.65,000/- * ' * (c) Royalty Rs. 3/12/- * ' Rs.2/10/- ' « (with minimum payment of Rs. 250,000/- instead of Company’s Rs.200,000} (d) Export Tax of 5 annas instead of 2 annas offered by Company (e) Ohaikh to have a Local Representative to deal with Company’s Representatives in Kuwait; (f) Shaikh to have a Representative on Board in London. 9. During a frw minutes conversation which I later had with Holmes, I gathered that the Rs.3/12/- Royalty and the 5 annas Export Tax was the thing that frightened him most about the Shaikh’s figures. It would be quite impossible, he said, for the Company to eeoepi the Shaikh’s figures, ss if agreed to, it would prevent any Oil being marketable. Both he and Chisholm (who later joined us) seemed rather pi ased than otherwise to get the Shaikh’s figures. They seamed to feel that they had something to start on atleast. They, ©i course, intend to bargain downwards. 10, I myself think the main thing that now counts is the initial/2 ** Ini tial payiaent. on signature (’a' above): but I do not think the £haikh will accept anything below Hs.^sO.OOO. This, of course. is ray private view only. Shaikh to agree to something reasonable as regards Hoyalty and Export Tax ( f c* above), they should not waste time about the ^initial figure ff , but should act big and generously• It is most Important to my mind to arrive at a quick decision . Holmes, I believe, thinks, as I do, though Chisholm appears to be more keen on bargaining* In this matter I value Holmes opinion more than that of Chisholm, as he knows much more of the Shaikh^ psychological ^raake up 1 *. 11* I have a shrewd suspicion that perhaps both Holmes and Chisholm think that I have been giving the Shaikh advice; needless to say I have done nothing of the kind* I am leaving him entirely to hitaself at present* 13* I have also noticed a sli^t t end one y on the part of Holmes and Chisholm to distrust each other, which is a pity *. this between ourselves * Holmes appears to be in favour oi each of than seeing the ahaikh separately, but Chisholm does not agree* Holmes* idea is that the ahaikh will n thaw* some-* what if he sees him alone, and complains that when they are both present together, the chaikh is as stiff and non-committal as the proverbial ? ’poker rf * * also think that provided the Company can get the Yours sincerely, Sd*H*R,P.

Bin waud a document authorising him to introduce any Company (Oil or otherwise) who were anxious to negotiate a concession with Bin 3aud, Obviously Abdul Latif hopes to get the Kuwait Oil Company to nibble at the Neutral None, and has asked Bin Baud to let him do 'go between'. (4) Abdul Latif similarly hopes to get m 'Arms Concession' for the supply of rifles and munitions to the King. He is working for a Spanish firm as I told you when you were here. (5) Behind everything, and looming clearly above all else, is Bin Baud's great need of money. Can we not turn this to account?f ^ \ 1 i^r. Kemp, oi the koweit Oil Coy., called, ihe Coy. have received a telegram from their representatives at Koweit giving the terras which the Sheikh proposes as a result of recent bargaining. The financial terms are considerably in advance of those first offered by the Coy., but the Coy. are prepared to agree to them. The Sheikh also proposes (a) that he should have a director on the Board of the Coy. in London, and (b) that he should be consulted about the appointment of the chief local representative. The Coy., of course, see great difficulties m (a). The Sheikh has apparently intimated that his proposals represent his last word. The Coy.'s negotiators, Messrs. Chisholm and Holmes, have suggested to the Coy. that it might ease matters if the Sheikh were invited to pay a visit to this country as the guest of the Coy. Mr. Kemp wished quite informally to get some indication of our views on this proposal. I informed him that, in the case of a similar invitation by Mr. Jansen last year, the Political Resident/ Ir t*^ Resident had informed the Sheikh that he was at liberty to accept it, bat that acceptance was not encouraged, and the Sheikh was informed that any such visit would be quite unofficial (see P.Z. 2367/33). as a result, nothing came of the proposal. Our attitude towards the Koweit Oil Coy. was, of course, quite different from that towards the Eastern and General Syndicate last year. But we should have to consult the Political Resident before giving any opinion about the idea of a visit, if the Coy. cared to nut the proposal up. Mr. Kemp asked that we should not consult the Political Resident until we hear again from the Coy. As regards (b) above, Mr. Kemp asked whether I could give any indication of the official attitude. I said that I could not do so, as here again it would be necessary to consult the Political Resident; but that it might be that it might prove possible to meet the Sheikh’s wishes on this point by informing him, through the Political Agent, of the person proposed by the Coy. as chief local representative before H.M.G. intimated ^^ approval of an appointment.e Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.

ON BEHALF OF THE Kuwait oil company limited SHAIKH OF KUWAIT IN THE PRESENCE OF IN THE PRESENCE OFMr* Waljrdn, Under secretary of State, Please see previous submission on P.z.1565/34 below. I had understood that the draft telegram submitted on that paper and since despatched had been agreed, but this appears to have been a misunderstanding which I much regret, to. Hendel # s letter attached represents, I understand, Sir R. Vansittart f s views (as will be seen they differ considerably from those of the Eastern Department as embodied in the draft telegram). I do not think: it is practical politics to tell the Sheikh of Koweit that we will agree to his giving this concession to no one other than the Koweit Oil Company. We shall merely defeat our ends if we take too definite a line over this. As regards the warning, Colonel Powle has made out a strong case for making the position clear to the Sheikh, and something on the lines of the telegram seems the most satisfactory method of disposing of it. the Foreign Office are, of course, apprehensive of the Americans - as they have always been. But v/e shall have to face the question of imposing conditions on the entry of/ • ' 1 WBmIBof American cap ital or nationals into these Gulf Sheikhdoms in the case of Qatar and elsewhere. We are cuiite uncommitted in the present case hy anything that passed in 1932 and we should, 1 think, do better to take our courage in our hands at this stage, rather than by temporising to give either the Sheikh or the Americans the idea that we have not really made up our minds.

We have carefully considered the views set out in your letter under reply, hut we still think that the right course is that suggested in the draft telegram and our reasons are the following. 3. In the first place, we feel that in a matter such as this, we must he guided hy Fowle, hut who on the one hand fully appreciates (for he has copies of all correspondence and has been in close touch with us throughout the possibility of difficulties with the Americans and the point of view held at this end, hut who, on the other, is in close personal touch with the Sheikh, knows the local A L * ■ Immediate. 1 &lt;■ MAH 1934 \ W dear George, 1 '• G.W. Rendel, Bsq., CM5., Many tiianks for your letter of Foreign Office. the 8th March, E.I201A60/91. I am sorry for the misunderstanding about the telegram to the Political Resident on the Koweit oilsituation and is the test judge of what is or is not likely to conduce to achieve the ends which we both desire. Fowle has eniphaticaxj.y recommended in the first place that we should not overemphasise the strength of our support for the Ko we it Oil Company, because to do so would defeat its own ends. Secondly, that it is important to give the Sheikh a warning in the terms he suggests that he has not an entirely free hand as regards the disposal of his oil concession His telegram of 6th l£arch, 287, which was received after our meeting, further emphasises the importance of some warning on these lines. 4. We recognise the attractiveness of your suggestion that we should teli the Sheikh in so many words that we will give our consent to the grant of a concession hy him to no company othe than the Koweit Oil Company. But, attractive as this may appear to he, we doubt if it is practical politics. Quite apart from the fact that it &lt;V» cAA'v ^ wouldfbe unfair to present the Sheikh with an ultimatum of this type (we have to consider his financial interests and the terms of our treaties with him), we think we should probably s «CLVAJC (MA vVl'cv-k erm uwii mfe.

We fully appreciate the possible difficulties with the thS. Government: they have been present to us through out. But we cannot agree, as I made a correspondence, the only pledges in which were that we abandoned our - right to require that any concession should be given to an exclusively British company. We have now, as Powle has pointed out, admitted to impose restrictions as to the conditions under which such capital and the next stage would be that in Cl CAjry^JL r American capital, and it is open to us, on the ground of local conditions 2262 5000 11.33 shall/^ ^Cccka &gt;4 n CT^ . - | '-» K23H i/t ~ &lt; ^ ^ ‘^f ait &lt; * JV ^Y ^Ci cCiU- It: 9 % I UA at A . shall operate or £&amp;€&amp;&amp; m-^cre- work of the Compahy't In ary case, even if we were to avoid difficulty on this score in Koweit, we should certainly have to face the issue in the near future in But v/e shgfcl in doth cases Qatar^ justify our attitude not, as suggested in para.5 of your letter, on the ground that we are anxious to benefit British as opposed to American enterprise, hut on the ground that we have special, responsibilities in these areas, and that having regard to this we must within reason prescribe the terms on which foreign capital or foreign nationals shall he employed 6. For these reasons, we feel strongly that the instructions in our telegram to Fowle of 7th i/Jarch should he allowed to stand and we will regard it as important, in the interests of i making the position clear to the Sheikh, that the Resident should be allowed to make the necessary communication to the Sheikh with as little delay as possible, we trust that in view of the explanation I have given above you will now he prepared to agree. J, G. LAlTHWAlTE,INL^AEO (32SJ FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I., 8th March, 1934. (E 1201/160/91) ^ IMMEDIATE . My dear Gilbert, Following our conversation over the telephone of this afternoon, I write to give you the views of my higher authorities on the draft telegram to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the oil concession which we drafted at our meeting on the evening of March 6th, 2. You will remember that that draft telegram explained that we should greatly prefer to inform the Sheikh frankly that we wish the concession given to the Koweit Oil Company. If, however, Fowle still sees objection to this positive course, he may warn the Sheikh - but only orally - that His Majesty’s Government ’’will not consent to the grant ”of the concession to any Company which is not (like the r ’koweit Oil Company) at least 50$ British'. My higher authorities here, while prepared in the last resort to agree 22 MAR. 1954 from secretary, PouiteAL SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFliFit as making Sheiki allowe commun little that i given j to agr ua. CCL f tjm. U I*- « shall operate the Company* In any case, even if we were to avoid difficulty on this score in Koweit, we should certainly have to face the issue in the near future in Qatar^ But we sfrgfcl in doth cases justify our attitude not,as suggested in para.5 of your letter, on the ground that v as opj on the respor that t withir which natior■■■ •v. .. - 2 - agree to the second alternative, i.e. proposed warning to the Sheikh - would very greatly prefer the first alternative - i.e. active support for the Koweit Oil Company. They question indeed whether it is really necessary at this stage to give the Resident latitude for the second and less desirable course, i.e. the warning, since they find it hard to believe that, if Powle is tactful and,while not giving enthusiastic support to the Koweit Oil Company, makes it perfectly plain to the Sheikh that we will not consent to his giving the con cession to anyone else, he will fail in the end to have his way. They would therefore much have preferred to put Ak-IjUa lv&lt;- this point to Fowle in the first instance and ask him V a i (. Xt / cVm ( whether he thinks it will meet the case. If Powle s reply is a categorical negative they would then be pre pared to agree to the second course. 3. I have already explained to you orally our reasons for holding these views. The whole origin of our dispute- ”**** ULK COL k * shall operate or shar# work of tire Company* In any case, even if we 4- were to avoid difficulty on this score in Koweit, we should certainly have to face the issue in the near future in Qatar^ But we steil in doth cases justify our attitude not,as suggested in para.5 of your letter, on the ground that \ H 'k'LkKviJr dispute with the United States Government over this question was that Government’s support of the Gulf Oil Company of California, and their suspicion that we were secretly favouring the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The fact that these two competitors have now combined their forces on mutually satisfactory terms means that if the new combine - i.e. Koweit Oil Company - gets the concession there v/ill be no further reasonable cause for dispute, and the United States Government will have no legitimate grievance. I think therefore that if our support of the Koweit Oil Company were at any time called in question, we should be in a very strong position and have an excellent defence, and there therefore seems no reason from the international point of view why we should not frankly and definitely veto the grant of the concessi to any Company - whatever its national complexion - other than the Koweit Oil Company. Indeed, by doing this we shall be ensuring that the original object of the United States Government's intervention - i.e. that the Gulf on Oil^ Oil Company of California should have an equal chance of participating in the development of Koweit Oil - adequately met. 4. If on the other hand we make a statement to the Sheikh which implies that he is free to invite any other Company to compete for his oil provided it has a British complexion, we shall sacrifice vis-a-vis the Americans^, the whole strength of our position in giving our specific support to the Koweit Oil Company, and we shall expose ourselves to the accusation of having made conditions based solely on considerations of nationality^, the effec competitors. This will be a much harder position to defend, since it will be clear that we are no longer observing the pijnciple of the open door to which in the case of Koweit the Americans regard us as committed. of which will be to exclude practically all American 5. It is quite true that we are not observing the principle of the open door in Qatar, since we are warning- the Sheikh/that he must not give the concession to any Company which is not at least partially British. But we have never been committed to the open door policy in Qatar and can always reasonably argue to the Americans that Qatar is such a wild and dangerous place that we have found it necessary to insist on retaining a direct hold of any Company which may operate there. I think this defence is likely to be strengthened rather than weakened if we treat Qatar somewhat differently from Koweit, as we are thus less likely to expose ourselves to the accusation of differentiation on national grounds purely for the benefit of British as opposed to American enterprise. 6. I gathered from you over the telephone today that owing to a misunderstanding the telegram has already been sent off, and that in view of a later telegram which has now come in from Fowle, you do not think there is any possibility of either cancelling it or asking him to suspend action On it. As my higher authorities are prepared in the last resort to accept the second alternativeX - 6 - ^ alternative course of action proposed in it, and I understand that your higher authorities felt very strongly that the telegram should go without further amendment, I do not want to press this point further. I hope, however, that you may be willing to consider sending fowle some urgent supplementary message, passing on to him the substance of the arguments developed above / so as to reduce to a minimum the risk of his giving the Sheikh of Koweit, without its being absolutely necessary to do so, a v/arning which ; even in its present form and even if given only orally, may yet ^/think^in certain eventualities, give us a good deal of trouble from the international point of view. Yours ever, /• •. •f.Z- tt'ir Mr. Y/alvirdn, Under Secretary of State, Please see paragraph 3(h) of Colonel Fowle’s telegram of 16th February, T.44, on P.Z.1120/34, flaggea. The Foreign Office were not happy as to the proposed warning to the sheikh ana the question was uiscussea with them at a meeting yesterday afternoon. As a result the telegram attached was agreed. This is, I think, not unsatisfactory from our point of view,. t H JLj'l tj. ^ I ^ ^ rM. as it is in fact rather stiffer than the warning actually recommended by the Resident. The Foreign office, while admitting that the 1932 discussions aid not cover the points now f in issue, were very anxious to avoia any written communication, v/e might, I think, let the Resident, either personally or through Colonel Dickson, convey the necessary warning orally to the sheikh.

Iy dear halton, Yonr letter dated the 27th February enclosing copy of a letter from Fraser suggesting amendments to t h e Koweit agr e ement. It seems that the proposed addition to Clause 12 01 bl; Government agreement makes no difference whatever to the substance of the agreement since it is already provided in Article 18 of the commercial agreement that any difference or dispute :r in connection herewith' shall be settled by arbitration and Sub-Article (d) lays the duty upon the arbitrators of specifying an adequate period of delay within which the Company may conform to the decision. You will remember that at the meeting Sir Louis Kershaw explained very fully that in his view Article 18 of the commercial agreement was applicable if the concession were terminated under the proposed new J.0. Walton Esq. C.B.,M*C., Sub-Article .. India Office, S.W.l.- 2 - ^.ruiole 11 (d). It was onl^r on this understanding* that agreement was reached. In these circumstances I don T t think there can oe any Admiralty objection to the proposed addition to Clause 12 of the G-oveminent agreement. The proposed modification in the new clause for the commercial agreement is verbal only and I am sure the Admiralty would not wish to interfere merely on a drafting point. Copies of this letter have been sent to Starline: end darner. Yours sincerely,S.W. 1. P« Z#1047/34. 24th February 1934. I enclose a copy of the Draft Agreement between riis Ibajesty's Government ana the Koweit Oil Company, revised as the result of our meeting with you and Mr. Stevens yesterday. ° was agreed at the meeting to insert a sub- clause (d) in Article 11 (a) of tne Draft agreement between the Company ana the sneikh as follows; '(a) If the Company shall fail to observe any of the terms of the agreement between the Company and His majesty's Government signed in London on ' Aiid also to add a new clause to the Commercial Agreement as follows* “It is hereby declared that in so far as the terms of tnis Agreement are inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of an Agreement between the Company and „ .

These local relations shall always be conducted through the Political Agent at Koweit, except as regards routine commercial business, which may be transacted through the official representative^ (if any) whom the Sheikh may appoint under the agreement between the Company and the Sheikh* 5 . Subject to the terms of the concession the Company undei'takes at all times to pay due deference to the wishes of the Sheikh of Koweit and to the advice of the Political Agent and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* 6 . The right given to the Company by its agreement with the Sheikh to utilise means of transportation by air shall be subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the Sheikh on the advice of His Majesty’s Government. 7 * In the application of the right given to the Sheikh by his Agreement with the Company to make full use free of charge of the Company’s wireless and telegraph installations and railways for governmental purposes in times of national emergency, the Sheikh acting on the acxvice of H.M.G. shall be the sole judge whether a 'national emergency' has arisen. 8 * Notwithslanding anything contained in the agreemait between the Company and the Sheikh of Koweit the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy, and shall not include in the areas selected for the purposes of its operations, any sites which may have been selected by or on behalf of the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government for defence purposes, for aerodromes, aeroplanes or seaplane bases or for wireless and telegraph installations or in connection v/ith the development of harbours, provided that with the consent of His Majesty’s Government which shall/3. shall not he unreasonably withheld the Company shall have tie right to use for the purposes of its operations such harbours as may be developed by the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government if there is not reasonable harbour accommodation available elsewhere* Harbours developed by the Company shall be under its complete and* exclusive control* 9* Telegraph, wireless and telephone installations, if any, maintained by the Company shall be for use only in its business and as provided in the concession, and shall be so constructed and operated that their operations shall not interfere with the operations of such wireless, telegraph or telephone installations as may be established by the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government* 10* The Company declare that it is their intention, should they consider that commercial conditions justify it, to erect a refinery at Koweit* If and when the Company is satisfied that commercial production is assured, the Company agrees to examine with His Majesty’s Government the question of establishing a refinery in Koweit of suitable type and capacity* 11* In the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of either of which His Majesty’s Government shall be the sole judge) His Majesty’s Government shall have the right of pre-emption of all the oil produced in Koweit in accordance with the terms of the schedule hereto* 12. In the event of notice of termination of the Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh being given under the terms of that Agreement on the ground that the Company has failed to observe any of the terms of the present Agreement between the Company and H.M.G., the arbitration provisions of the said Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh shall apply it the Company considers that notice of termination on such g;rcunds under that Agreement is not justified* In Witness Whereof on behalf of/and. t/h.6 Company has honoun'to caused its Common Seai to 'b e at fixed, the day and year rirst above written.

I should be glad of your views as to Sheikh s probable reactions to insertion of such Clause during negotiations at Koweit 0 It would obviously make it necessary to communicate terms of the parallel agreement or at least its substance to the Sheikh, but it would still be Question at v/hat stage in his negotiations with the Company this should be dcne aDraft Paper.

A (&amp;J) We shall probably consult yeu, the \u. and the Petroleum Dept, officially on this, and perhaps suggest that it should be signed by one of our Under Secretaries; if you and the other Depts. concurred officially in this, we should then have the authority of four I. misters for its signature, and I suppose this would be quite adequate authority for a signature purporting to be on behalf of H.l/'.G. 2' The representatives of the Koweit Oil Coy. are anxious to kwe the draft in -1 c^l—form if possible before Mr. Stevens leaves London for America on Friday night. If we can arrange a meeting with them on Thursday or Friday, we can give them the draft, and also discuss with them the additional clauses for insertion m the ji commercial agreement which ha\e formed the subject of my correspondence with you ending with your letter of 31st Jany., 1.0145/34. j ’We think that we should propose a/ 2262 5000 11.33a clause for insertion in the commercial agreement of a simple character to tne following effect:- * 'It is hereby declared that so far as the terms of this agreement are inconsistent or in conflict with ^he terms of ^thQ agreement between I : • 1-• G■ and the Coy. (vrtiich Agreement is set \ \ ' oat in the Schedule hereto) tne ten s of this agreement shall be subordinate i to and controlled by the terms of the j agreement between H.L.G. and the Coy.” It will be unnecessary to insert a clause to provide that the commercial agreement shall not come into force until the agreement between the Coy. and the Govt, is concluded, because it is now clear that the latter agreement will be ready for conclusion before the other one. It will probably be convenient to arrange for their simultaneous execution /, As regards point (a) mentioned m i i&gt;&lt;i»«. your letter of 31st Jany., you-^iil Lrt oba^-vcd that and G-r Clause 2 of the agreement between the Coy. and the Govt the former may not transfer their agreement with the Sheikh to any other coy, without the prior consent of H.L.G.; H.L.G. would thus have the opportunity, if t • any such transfer were proposed, to make ! /VDraft Paper.

We might perhaps try for ^ the insertion m Art. 11 of the commercial agreement, after (A)(c), of words to the following effect:- H (d) If the Coy. shall fail to observe any of the terms of the agreement concluded between the Coy. and H.M.G.” The difficulty which we see is that the Coy.’s representatives may naturally object that this gives H.M.G. an arbitrary power to determine the concession if m their opinion there has been failure to observe any of the terms of the Govt, agreement, though it might be open to dispute whether such failure had occurred or not. For example, it might be a disputable point whether or not the Coy. had observed Clause/Clause 3 of the Govt, agreement, as tms might turn on such a fine point as whether the consent of H.IhG. to the employment of a particular foreigner was reasonably or unreasonably withheld, '..n tne otho* hand, we could, I suppose, i ue the arbitrary power of H.k. C 1 . to sec ...i e the determination of the concession woulu be limited by the arbitration clause (Art. 18) of the commercial agreement. If the Sheikh (under our advice) claimed that the concession should be terminatedj under the suggested addition to Art. 11, and the Coy. disputed it, the dispute would be arbitrable as a matter of the interpretation of Art. 11; this would raise a question jof fact whether or not the Coy. had failed -to - (si (dUi tds SIM/l U** J observe Clause 3^of the Govt, agreement, and the interpretation of this clause also would m this way come before the arbitrator. 7 / a- ^ ^ ^ ^ Yours sinoerablk •344 J. 0.

Compensation/KUWAIT OIL AGR^EIffiNT. oiATAR OIL AGREEMENT. In regard to Paragraph 2 of your note of the 13th instant the Cladtee desired i*_ 'It is hereby declared that so far as the terms of this agreement are^in conflict with the terms of the H.M C agreement (which agreement is^set out in hereto) the terms of this agreement shall be^S^kt Vtt*£rms of the H.M.G. agreement. 11 K This Clause is drawn to be inserted in the Company-Sheikh aJTterthe draft clause set out under Paragraph 3 . 'I-L H.M.G. shall at any time determine the agreement dated the day of 193 and made between H.M.G. and the Company (hereinafter led the H.M.G. agreement') then this agreement shall be thereby determined'. This Clause is only effective if there is a Clause m the H.M.G. - Company agreement providing for the right of H.M.G. to determine that agreement if the terms of that agreement not observed. A Clause partly of this effect was included in my note in answer to yours of 17th January, 1934. Paragraph 4. The description of the Company suggested so as would to include assigns/not alone overcome the difficulty as the Company might assign the Company - Sheikh agreement only. But with a Clause in the H.M.G. - Company agreement that/that ' The company shall not be entitled to assign the rights or liabilities of this agreement or of the agreement made between the Company and the Sheikh except to the person to whom the Company shall at the same time assign the rights and liabilities of the said agreement between the Company and the Sheikh or of this agreement respectively' as well as the suggested description the position is secured. I presume that a clause 'This agreement shall be construed in accordance with and the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto regulated by the laws of England' will be included in the H.M.G. - Company agreement and in the Company-Sheikh agreement. It would be senseless for ''he advice given to be rendered useless by a possible provision in the local laws of which we have no knowledge and which in the absence of provision to the contrary would govern the Company-Sheikh agreement. the usual way of making one agreement subject to the terms of another agreement is to set out the later agreement in a schedule to the former. Execution^ Crown Contracts. A contract can be made by a servant of the Crown on behalf of the Crown and the servant cannot he made personally liable on such a contract. (Dunn v. MacDonald (1897)1 ). Such a contract would presumably be signed by the servant on behalf of the Crown. There appear to be no cases expressly deciding whether any particular servant of the Crown has authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Crown by reason of his office alone or whether he has to have express authority/authority from the Grown. The Courts in the cases which have come for decision have never questioned the authority of the servant of the Crown to contract on behalf of the Crown. (Dunn v. R. 1896, I.Q,.B.)Minute Paper. O Department. Le gal Adviser . 1 ' -As it is probable that the Coy.-Govt, agreement will be signed before the Coy.-Sheikh agreement, it is not necessary to consider farther for the moment a clause providing that the latter will not cone into operation tillthe former is signed. c ^ ie Coy.’s negotiations with the Sheikh may be duficalt. Iu may be desirable at some stage m these negotiations to inform the Sheikh that it is proposed to insert m the Coy.-Sheikh agreement a claase making it subject to the terms of the Coy.-Govt, agreement, and to inform him concurrently of the substance of the latter agreement. But as the Sheikh may be rather shy of such a clause , it may be desired that it should not contain too much matter of detail, but that its terms should be as general and short as possible. The main desideratum . I think, is to provide quite generally that the terms of the Coy.-Sheikh agreement are subject to those of the Coy.-Govt, agreement, wherever the latter may be at variance with the former. Could you kindly suggest a short clause on . these lines? 3. I am not sure if it will now be considered necessary to provide in the Coy.-Sheikh agreement that it shall be void if the Coy. fails in any of its obligations under the Coy.-Govt, agreement. But as the Admiralty have suggested this, it may be necessary to consider it further. Perhaps, therefore, you could kindly draft a short separate clause in general terms -C9 5000 8.33 covering this point. ^ '~g A g' / ^ .4 . Another point raised in the Admiralty ci.o. letter of 31st Jany. is that any transferee coy. shall not be entitled to work the concession until they have entered upon an undertaking to observe the terms of the uoy.-uovt. agreement. Could this not be adequately provided for m the preamble of the Govt.-Coy. agreement by providing therein that the agreement is made with the 'Koweit Oil Coy. , its successors and assigns (hereinafter called the Coy., which expression shall where the context so admits be deemed to include its successors and/or assigns)', or words to that j effect? 5. It is thought that it may be undesirable to provide exnressly that the courts of England shall have jurisdiction to determine all disputes relating to the Coy.-Govt, agreement, or to the rights and liabilities of the narties thereunder. V Perhaps, we could discuss the above points? Jt^Sa^tCr-nMinute Paper. O d : 2119 5000 8.33 , 'A7- 7 ^ Department. « i r ?? ?&gt;~7% ^ei:al adviser , Jiil you please refer to ir&lt;y reference of 17th J any., and the draft of two clauses for the conrnercial agreements regarding the oil concessions ( in Koweit and me one for the Govt. agreement, ( which you kindly supplied. A question has been raised by the Koweit OillCoy. whether the requirements ((a) that the agreement between the Coy. and the Sheikh will not come into force till the agreement between the Coy. and H.M.G. has been concluded, and (b) that the former agreement will be subject m all respects to the terms of the latter) would not be sufficiently provided for by including clauses in the agreement between the Coy. and H.M.G. alone, without including anything on these points m the agreement between the Coy. and the Sheikh. If, as may quite probably happen, the agreement between the Coy. and H.M.G. is actually concluded and signed simultaneously with or before signature of the agreement between the Coy. and the Sheikh, point (a)would of course not arise. But in any event it is very important to r 'ake sure of point (b) above. Could you kindly advise whether it would be clear in law that tne Coy.-Sheikh agreement was subject in all respects to the Coy.-H.F.G. agreement^if a provision to this effect were contained only in the Coy.-HH .G. agreement, and not in tie Coy.- She ikh agre ement ? If the presence of such a clause m the Coy.- H.M.G. agreement alone would have the desired effect of limiting the Coy.’s rights under the Coy.-Sheikh agreement so,so far as these were inconsistent with the terns of the Coy.-H.M.G. agreement, bat if the terms of the latter were not at the time of signature disclosed to the Sheikh, would the Sheikh, if he became aware of the Coy.-'.; -f • agreement, be able, if he wished, to repudiate his obligations under the Coy.-Sheikh agreement, on ground that they had been subject to another agreement of ®S the ter^s of which he had not been made ccgnisaiiu. 6pj u ^ 'P* 4a-^ 4 fuvij fiti cr. , «, * y £?&gt;Vk- £ 'I'LL 91^ if / TO #o iM I think; that to obtain the desired effect both clauses must be inserted in the Company-sheikh agreement unless in fact both agreements are entered into at the same time when the clause referred to as (a) in your note may be omitted. The reasons for this answer to the Second paragraph of your note of the 8th are:- (a) 1. if this clause is not included in the commercial agreement between the Company and the Sheikh the same effect cannot be obtained by including a provision in the His Majesty*s Government - Company agreement. 2 . Such a clause in the His Majesty^ Government - Company agreement would obviously be of no use as the clause would not come into force before the time contemplated in it. 3 ♦ I think that in law if such a clause were inserted in the His Majesty*s Government - Company agreement it would give the Sheikh a right of action in tort against His Majesty*s Government for interfering with the contractual relations between the Company and the Sheikh, Quinn v. Leathern, 1901 A.C. (so far as the Crown can, at law, be liable for tort which is not at all). (b) The notes 1 and 3 of (a) above apply with equal force to this clause. The question whether, if these two clauses are included in the His Majesty*s Government - Company agreement and not in the Company-Sheikh agreement, the mere completion of the His Majesty*s Government - Company agreement by the Company would constitute a breach by the Company of the Company/z Company — Skeikh. agreement will not arise 11 my advice is acted upon and* therefore* X have not dealt with it# Government - igreement is a commercial agreement* It would he as well to hear in mind that it is not within the competence of the Crown to make a contract which would have the effect of limiting its power of executive action in the future though it can enter into commercial, contracts* I am not clear as to whether the His Majesty 1 sCypher telegrm from Secretary of State Addressed to Political Resident in Persian Gulf 8 Bushire 0 Noo337 s Repeated to Government of Indiajoreign and Political Dept 0 , No o338' D Dated 7 G 2 0 34 e No ©of words 466 and 466 0 t IWQI&amp;M&amp;o IH Your telegram 1st February No 0 111 and connected correspondence 0 Negotiations have been proceeding with Koweit Oil Company controlled in equal shares by A o P o 0oC c and Gulf Oil of U O S 0 A O 2 0 As regards commercial agreement 9 I am sending to you by next air mail to Bagdad draft as agreed with Company to serve as basis for their negotiations locally with the Sheikh 0 Company are sending draft out with a view to immediate opening of negotiations with progress of which Political Agent will be kept in close touche 3 g As regards Government Agreement between His Majesty 5 s Government and Company, substance of provisions to be embodied has been agreed with other Departments concerned and with the Company 0 4 e Great difficulty was experienced in regard to question of local personnel owing to objection of Stevens to any discrimination on grounds of nationality 0 Negotiations threatened to breakdown on this point but finally after exploring many other alternatives agreement was reached on following provisions® (Begins) The employees of the Company in Koweit shall at all times so far as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit 0 With the constat c His Majesty 8 * Government which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, persons of other nationalities may be employed if in the opinion of the Company they are required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking (Inds)o T/ /I coneider that the above fully meets our essential requirements. Important point is that the Company will have to seek the consent of His Majesty's Government m regard to employment of foreigners, which makes it much stronger than corresponding provision in Bahrein agreement 0 5 0 Among otherprovisions for Government agreement the imre important may be briefly summarised as fo Howes- (a) the importation of foreign native labour shall be subject to the approval of the Political Resident. (b) One of the superior local employees to be designateds, subject to the approval of His Majesty f s Government chief local representative, to be ordinarily resident at Koweit and responsible for the Company's local relations with the Koweit authorities (which shall always be conducted through the Political Agent at Koweit except as regards routine business of minor importance)© (c) Subject to terms of the concession Company undertake to pay due deference to wishes of Sheikh and advice of Political Agent and Political Resident 0 (d) A provision safeguarding His Majesty°s Government e s right to select sites for defence purposes, aerodromes* telegraphs, wireless, or development of harbours; (e) clause to which Admiralty agree in regard to future possibility of local refining; (f) provision for pre-emption in time of war 0 Papers follow by next air mail 0 6 0 If you have ary observations on provisions stated or summarised above, I should be glad if you would telegraph, but you will, I think, agree that we have obtained all that is essential from the political point of view© This has only been achieved after protracted negotiations, and as you are aware it was essential to avoid a breakdown since if present applicants dropped out we could not permanently refuse/refuse consent to Sheikh granting the concession t© some other applicant^ which would in all probability bo a wholly foreign company, from which it would have been impossible to obtain conditions satisfying our political requirements»* ^rd February, 1954.

Soiae discussion took place on the question whether some ohing should be paid by the Company for exemption from taxation oeiore the time when commercial production was declared, out it was agreed that no payment need be made oy the Company under this head on the understanding that the value of the exemption was taken into account in fixing tne amount of the dead rent in Article 3 (b) .

Article 15 . The Company agreed to the same alteration here as in Article 12 (3) (b). The Company} lagreed that before the signature of the Commercial Agreement with the Sheikh a clause should be added either in the Commercial Agreement or in the Government Agreement, or possibly in both, providing that the Commercial Agreement/4. Agreement should not take effect until the Government Agreement had been concluded and that the terms of the Commercial Agreement should be subject to the terms of the Government Agreement. It was decided that meanwhile His Majesty's Government should seek legal advice as to the agreement in which this clause should appear and whether the Sheikh would have legal grounds for objecting to the Commercial Agreement if it were in some manner qualified by a Government Agreement of which he did not know the terms. The Company agreed that the Political Agent would be kept in close touch with their negotiations with the Sheikh and immediately informed of the result of all meetings and of all developments including any alteration in the financial terms offered.

Mr. Fraser and Mr. otevens strongly represented the difficult position in Vvhicn the Company might be placed if this alteration were not made, since, under the article in its present form, bimy might be called upon 13 /' His Majesty's Government to vacate an area on which the 3 ?' had already commenced operations. It was agreed that the matter should be further considered with the Air Ministry. Subject to the concurrence of the Admiralty it was agreed to add after 'harbours' in line 11 'as may be developed by the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government' and to add at the end of the clause the sentence 'Harbours developed by the Company shall be for its exclusive use'. 7. The following redraft of this clause was agreed subject to a reference to the Communications Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence:- 'telegraph, wireless and telephone installations, if any, maintained by the Company shall be for use only in its business and as provided in the concession, and shall be so constructed and operated that their operations shall not interfere with the operations of such wireless, telegraph or telephone installations as may be established by the Sheikh or His Majesty's Government'. 8 .

He have the following suggestions to make. Preamble and throughout .- Substitute “Sheikh 1 ’ for 'Govt. 11 . Art . 2 .- Add new sub-clause (Cl The Coy. shall supply an annual report to the Sheikh of its operations under this agreement. Art. 4 .- Add at the end of the last sentence 'with the exception of such figures therein as he may be ‘required by law to publish'. Art. 5 (af .- Add after line 12 'the inhabitants of the State of Koweit are not prevented from taking their usual requirements of these mat e rials, and that'. Add at the end of 5 (A) (as a qualification of transportation by air communication or operation) the words 'subject always to any general regulations for aircraft made by the Sheikh'. Art. 5(B_) .- Add after 'national emergency' '(as to which the Sheikh shall be the sole judge)'. We/ i iof We doubt the necessity of 6(B). No doubt in practice the Sheikh will appoint somebody to deal with the local representatives of the Coj- in regard to matters of a more or less routine character such as looking after the supply of information which the Coy. will render to the Sheikh, and n necessary checking measurements a ia statements of oil sold or exported on which royalty is payable. The provision in the Govt. Agreement that the Coy.’s local relations with the Koweit authorities shall always be conductsa through the Political xigent will not, course, be interpreted as including direct dealings between the representatives of the Sheikh and the Coy. on such matters as the above. Art. 7 .- We would like to reinsert in line 10 the words ’’food supplies” before the words 'personal goods”. Three lines from the end, after the word 'shall” before ”pay” insert 'in addition to the payments provided for in Art. 5”. End of Art. 9 .- (a) Insert 'with the consent of” before ‘'on conditions to be arranged”; (b) substitute 'the terms of such purchase or lease shall not be' for the/Draft Paper. AjiA-A^ !925 5000 6.33 the words H at rates not”; (c) add sentences such as appear in Art. 7 of the Qatr draft, viz-; M ?he Company shall acquire only such land houses and buildings as are necessary for its operations under this Agreement # ' id srvdf land shall at times thcuri.-^ 1 uliulfr of-Kowcit. The Company shall inform the Sh&amp;ikh from time to time of the land houses and buildings which it requires to occupy for its operations, and land houses and buildings previously acquired by the Company from the Sheikh but found no longer necessary for its operations shall be returned by the Company to the Shaikh free of cost.” Art. 11(c) .- Substitute M If the Coy. shall be in default under the arbitration provisions of Art.

Agreement is concluded, and that its rrovisions shall be read as subieet to the provisions of the latter 1 r agreement. As regards Art. 3, the financial terms to he finally included will of coarse depend on the course of the negotiations with the Sheikh. But we understand that / as the Political Agent is to be kept in close touch with the negotiations and to be immediately informed of all developments, he will be informed of the proposals first wade by the Coy. regarding the financial terms, and of subsequent developments in the negotiations regarding them.

P8P't D# PETROLEUM dlw f] A—/ 3»d' / DEPARTMENT (Mines Department), Dean Stanley Street. ) Millbank, Westminster, London, S.W.l. January, 1934. My dear Walton, With reference to your letter of the 16th January, (PZ 379/34) on the subject of the ICoweit oil concession the following are ray observations. I will deal first with the points you raise in your letter. (l) I agree that the draft is on rather different lines from that of Qatar but this I think is due to the fact that considerable discussions had already taken place with the Sheikh by the two parties who are now partners in the Koweit Oil Company. We know that a draft concession was submitted to the Sheikh by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and doubtless the Gulf Oil Company also submitted one. The Sheikh has to some extent probably already indicated his views on these drafts and the Companies may have tried to meet these views. (2) I agree with your suggestion to substitute '’the Sheikh” for ”the Government”. (3) I do not think that Art. 2 necessarily means production but there are definite drilling obligations. These are not, however, of a very onerous character. (4) Article 5 A. (l) I agree generally with your comment. (2) I doubt whether the Company will agree to substitute ’’agreement” for ’’consultation”. The Government agreement will I think meet our position. (3) The last sentence of Art. 5 (a) read in conjunction with the Government agreement appears to be harmless, although we might perhaps put it to the Company that this sentence might 'be deleted. •Walton, Esq.

( Dear Walton, With reference to our telei^hone talk this morning about the clause in the commercial agreement providing that it shall not come into force without the consent of H.M.

Department. Legal Adviser. negotiations are in progress for the grant of oil concessions in Qatr to the A.P.O.C. and in Koweit to the Koweit Oil Co. (which is controlled in equal shares . by the A.P.O.C. and the Gulf c Co. of the U.S.A.), sMthat the commercial side of each concession should be embodied in an agreement between the Coy. and the Sheikh concerned, while the political safeguards required by H.b.G. should be contained in agreements between and the Coy. It is proposed that the commercial agreements should contain a clause to the effect that they will net come into force until the Govt, agreements have been concluded. The Companies have prepared drafts of the commercial agreements, of which copies are attached, and these are under negotiation with them. The desiderata to be included in the Govt. agreements would be, so far as w r e have considered the matter at ore sent, those stated in che atuached list^- of suggested points. When consideration of these matters is somewhat further advanced, tne Dept, would. f ir so be grateful if you would prepare the/drafts of agreements in proper legal form to cover these points. In the meantime, we may possibly desire to discuss them in an informal and tentative way with the representatives of the Companies. At this stage, I should be grateful if you would state whether you have any observations on the lists of suggested points from the legal point of view- Could you also at this stage kindly advise on the/ 5000 8.33* the drafting of a clause for inclusion in the commercial agreements to provide that they will not come into force until the Govt, agreements have been concluded. Subject to your views, it seems desirable that such a clause, besides being of general application, should specifically cover the following points:- (a) that the Coy. will not transfer the concession or form any subsidiary company to work it, pending une conclusion of the Govt, agreement; (b) provision that the Coy. undertakes to carrjr out all the obligations of the Govt, agreement, notwithstanding anything contained m the commercial agreement. lujtux*iumBXUHE A&gt; provisions for local refining * Refinery . 5.

The Company shall complete the refinery and put and maintain it in efficient working order with due diligence and dispatch, but in any event within two years from the date on which the site of such refinery shall have been definitely approved or the production have reached tons per annum, ascertained as above, whichever event shall happen later. The Company shall from time to time make such additions to this refinery as may be requisite for dealing with the crude oil which the wells assessed as stated above are capable of yielding annually* The Company shall also provide tankage capable of containing a quantity equal to at least fifty per cent of the capacity for the time being of such refinery.

From the 1.0. point of view I have only the following tentative observations to make at this stage, though we may probably have others after going into it more deeply, and after consultation with the Political Resident: - (a) I think it would be preferable - ■ throughout the agreement to refer uo the Sheikh as such, and noo to the Govt. 1 *. (b) Art. 2 seems to indicate, subject to your views, that the Coy. mean to produce. (c) Art. 5 A: The facilities mentioned seem to be more comprehensive than in the Qatr case. In case the words 'which may be available' in the 11th line may not be a/ 1712alected c., to a sufficient safeguard for the requirements of the inhabitants, we night suggest adding after ’’provided always that' the words the inhabitants of the State of Koweit are not prevented from taking their usual requirements of these materials, and ...' (compare [Art. 9 of the Qatr concession). In the last sentence but one of Art. 5 A it would be desirable to substitute the word ” agreement” for the word H con suit at ion”. It will be necessary in the Govt, agreement to make provision to secure that sites se. by H.M.G. orthe Sheikh for aerodromes, eh telegraphic or wireless installations, thje development of harbours, etc., shall be available and not be interfered with by the Coy.’s operations. The last sentence of Art. 5 A seems require consideration. (d) Art. 5 B: Use of roads, railways and telephones by the Sheikh is not provided (e) Art. 6 A: We shall require the chief local representative to be a British subject and resident at Koweit. Perhaps subject of this article can best be deal' in the Govt, agreement. (f) Art. 6 B is something new, and unnecessary and undesirable, as we desires and hope to provide in the Govt, agreement that relations between the Coy.’s chief local representative and the Sheikh shall be conducted through the Political Agent. (g) End of Art. 7: This, I presume means some payment, in consideration for immunity from taxation, in addition to tlie royalty provided for in Art. 2. (h) Art. 8 B: Compare Art. 17 of the Qatr/ for. the ij with}atr draft. Th&amp; aabjoet will be A gartk»r dealt with in the Govt, agree nent N Meanwhile - thoagh thel point t issaelheye is less import ant/than th Df local/ superior British personnel /- nigh/ perhaps, at any rata for/bargaining purges els, take exception po /ihe wc^ds the\iudkment o f the UXCtn* A-yy*J' 7^ 1925 5000 6.33 perhaps also/to 5th line of Art. .5 C, 'of whicl/th^ Co.^shall soli^dudge’t? (i) Art. 12 B: The same points arise as are in issue in regard to Art. 13 of the Qatr draft. (j) Art. 14: This concerns the point you raised in the penultimate para, of your letter of 12th Jany. In the case of Qatr we propose to % * ( . » ask that any assignee company shall b| registered in the U.K., have its ^ principal place of business in the U.K., and that its Chairman shall at all times be a British subject. It will be much more difficult to obtain these requirements in the case of the Koweit agreement, because we are dealing ah initio with a half- American applicant. I understand that the agreement between the Anglo- Persian and the Gulf Co. is such that they would have the strongest objection to what I may call headquarters British control. Sih John Cadrnan, as well as Messrs. Frase) and Stevens, have in fact told us that] the arrangement in regard to the Chairman of the Koweit Co. is that he should be a British subject and an American in alternate years. The Co. will/r Ifci'is registered in Canada. will ^ registered in the T J*K. becaase (I understand) the promoters are satisfied that this will make little substantial difference m respect of liability to British income-tax, in view of the arrangements made for sharing the profits etween the parent companies. What are our views as to accepting the proposal hat -any transferee company need not be gistered in the U.K., but should be gistered within the British Empire? Perhaps Co. put this in as a safeguard for y^emselves in case it should be found later that the American share of the profits from a company registered in the U.K. is not exempt from British income tax.

P PETRI ^ *. / f'tl ' jiUM DEPARTMENT^ * Iines Department), Dean Stanley Street, Millbank, Westminster, London, S.W.l. 12th January, 1934* Dear Walton, /&lt;/ 7 I am obliged for your letter of the 10th January, with which you enclosed a copy of a letter you had sent to Mr. Fraser of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I am glad to know that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has accepted generally the proposed procedure under which there will he a commercial agreement negotiated with the Sheikh and another agreement between the A.P.O.C. and the Government. I feel sure that this will facilitate matters on all sides. The news we have just received that oil in substantial quantity has been discovered in Well No. 4 in Bahrein makes it all the more necessary to get concessions concluded in regard to Qatar and Kuwait as soon as possible. For our part, therefore, we will do all we can to expedite the examination of the draft Kuwait concession as soon as we receive it. With reference to the point raised by Mr. Stevens — regarding the clause we should like them to adopt to secure British exploitation, we can of course discuss this when we meet, but I do not think we should adopt Mr. Stevens* suggestion. Under the Bahrein clause as i t stands if there is a difference of opinion between the Sheikh and the Company, the matter can go to arbitration, but if the matter is to be left to the judgment of the Company, we place ourselves entirely in their hands. J. C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office , King Charles Street, S.W. 1.A**’ - 2 - I notice that in the letter to Mr. Fraser where you set out the principal headings which would need to 'be covered in the agreement between the A.P.O.C. and H.M. Government, you do not refer to the question of the possible assignment of the concession. I am inclined to think that this point ought to be dealt with even supposing it is the intention of the Kuwait Oil Company not to/sign the concession. We shall see when we receive the draft whether they provide, for this. If they do not, I think we ought to a clause dealing with this matter and I then suggest that we should need to have provisions in the agreement between the Company and H.M. Government similar to those which we are considering in the case of Qatar. i j I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel and Seal. Yours sincerely. FCS/EAJ. C.

Telephone National 1212 12th January, 1934. ht^ Dear Mr. Walton, With reference to Mr. Fraser ? s letter to you yesterday, it would probably be more convenient if, when the suggested talks take place, the Kuwait question be discussed in the first place with Mr. Stevens present, and the Qatar question be discussed as a second item. I presume this will prove equally convenient from your point of view. Will you kindly consider Mr. Fraser 1 s letter modified accordingly. Yours sincerely.( *iy / k , W** r p. z. ; Britannic Finsbury Circus, ^ London,E.C.2 1934 IXth January, 1934. Dear Mr. Walton, KUWAIT «OPY SENT BY AIR NtATL of l 2 JAN 1954 V, JyoJ^ I have to acknowledge your letter of the 10th inst. (PZ.253/34) * and am glad to in- , form you that we shall he able to send you a \c t ■ ' draft, covering the commercial side of the pro posed Concession, to-morrov/ morning (12th Jan.) In preparing this draft we have given due consideration to the suggestions made from your side with respect to the somewhat similar Qatar Concession and I hope and believe that, on examination, you will probably find little, if anything, in it which you will feel it necessary to criticise from your point of view. However, whatever comments you may wish to make will, of course, be most carefully considered by us. With respect to the parallel Agreement between the new Company and H.M.G., I would suggest that time might be saved if Mr. Stevens and I, or, in my absence, my colleague Mr. Hearn, were to sketch out the rough draft of a document at the India Office in conjunction with you, - as you suggest in the ante-penultimate paragraph of your letter. I do not anticipate much^diffi culty in respect to the majority of the points you mention and have little doubt that we shall succeed in finding a formula, even in regard to these other points, the import of which is at present not entirely clear to us. Incidentally,2 . the point regarding the nomination of the third arbitrator by the Political Resident has been incorporated in the Commercial Agreement, so that this will need no further discussion. It is possible that you may feel it desirable, in order to expedite procedure, to discuss the preliminary draft of the Government/ Company Agreement for Qatar on the same occasion as that for Kuwait comes under discussion. In that case I think we might so arrange it that Mr. Stevens arrives after we have had time to settle, in broad outline, the Qatar principles. Such a settlement Y\rould also, as I think you will agree, materially facilitate a settlement of the points which relate to Kuwait, since, in general, the principles governing them are much * the same. I quite appreciate the fact that the necessity you are under of arranging for inter- Departmental discussion in respect to the drafts in question involves more time than would be necessary if the subject came within the sole competence of the India Office, but I feel sure that you will do everything that is possible to facilitate an early settlement, having regard to the desire felt on our side to put our negotiators into the field at the earliest possible moment.
