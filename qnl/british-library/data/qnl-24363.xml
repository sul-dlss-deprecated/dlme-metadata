(u d ESTATE OF HAJI ABBAS ALI reza of Bahrain.CoJitd on page 2 * C/0 Anglo Iranian Oil Co.Ltd., His Britannic f/a.jesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas. © Band ar Abbas. Respected Sir, t ! , , ^ I ?:.V/V/V) I beg to quote the following in response to my brother-A r ahiuood Haji Abbas Ali Reza*s let'fer dated November 1946, to the Indian Assistant to Political Agent, Bahrien:- 1) 1) Iha^t acquisition of SaiiTicn Nationality by my Father does not deprive his sons and daughters, who still retain, thair original nationality, of their right of inheritance. z \ 2) That the alleged tfill in possession of xay brother does not hold water and cam ob* be acceptaole by any Judicial authority in view of the following facts:- s) That the paper is not in ay father’s hand writing nor th j signature below seems to oe that of my father, le, being literate, could have easily written his lafet words. b) That nothing is mentioned about my father’s landed property, if novrfhere else, atleast at Lingah which is Known to every one. c) That the Will is not attested either by a proper authority cr a neutral person. The only persons who witness the Will are my uncle and cans in who being the father-in-law and brother-in-law of my brother respectively cannot afford to witness in my favour and and their taking up my brother’s side is almost unavoidable. \ d) That bad the Will been lawful, he (my father) could have written it on a proper stamped form supplied by the Govern ment fot obis purpose and had registered with the proper authorities. The necessity of using uy father’s Memoranda form instead of proper document in itself domarid5explanation. Under the above circumstances you may please Judge whether this ?Jil2 can be considered as lawful. I trust soly on your Judgement. 3) On ray visit to Bahrain I demanded to see ruy father’s VIill , but my brother, knowing that my period of stay at Bahrain would be limit 3d and my leave was due to expire, kept on evading time and postponing production of the said Will till my leave had almost expired and I had no alternative but to lea^e the place otherwise to loss my Job which is my only means of living* At this critical hour he showed me the Will which declared uy share to be Rs.lOOO/- and which, they said was the expenses for my marriage. Suspecting that he may later on change his mind about the Will and state tnat my father died without any property (as he has said in his latter) and in order to prove that my deceased father had some sash at the time of his death, otherwise from what funa this as.1000/- was given to me, I received the amount from my brother against a receipt. Besides at the time of ay departure he did not totally refuse (As he has done in his letter) to part with our shares but instead he kept on promising that he would go through the accounts of my father and send me my sh^re after the settlement. It was only these sweet words that Kept me from filing a suit for such a long time. 4) That a Will prepared in favour of one brother and depriving other brothers, sisters and specially widowed wife of their rignt is considered r, Unlawfux r ’ according to the religious rule of Islam..2 5) Mahmood has three brothers on his side who are of the same - mother and who have grown rich with the capital provided for them by my father, besides their marriage expenses which had jo been many times more than Rs.iOOO/- set aside for me. They naturally do not object to Mahmood’s illegal forfeiting of remnant of ray fathcr*s estate, biii I do not see any reason for my keeping silent and not claiming shares of my two sis ters and widowed mother, if not my own. 6) In addition to the above the following facts are also worth consideringj- a) That, as everyone in Bahrain is aware my father’s firm had been a prospering one and his cash oalance at the time of his departure and death can be aceartsined from the Bank ana the Office Cash booxs if the latter are not re-arranged oy this time. On the other hand tfahmood head been working witn my father as a paid clerk and I have abeoxuteiy no hesitation to bring to your kind notice that he came from Abadan with a penniless pocket and even his travelling ex penses was met by my father. la it now justified that one who had been a paid clerk of my fatner (frven if his son) to transfer all ’’should divided property* to his name depriving otners ?. b) If, as he claims, my father had left nothing behind, then what your honour judge regarding exiatance of such a huge wealth with his paid clerk, Mahnood ? On my last visit, I saw this for myself. Can he show any other means by which he acquired his wealth ? Again imy I ask, if no cash was left by my father, from what fund the sum of Bs.1000/- was paid to me ? Does he mean to say that ha paid me this amount from his own pocket ? Having every confidence la your judgement and oeing unable to proceed to Bahrain personally fAs I am not due leave at this time) I am compelled to create this extra trouble for your good self for which I pray forglvance, I humbly request you to kindly as slat a helpless man with two sisters and a mother to support, by forwaruing my petition to the proper authority with your kind recommendation to take up the matter on ray behalf and bring the tresspassers to check. I shall gladly pay any expenses that may incur in this connection.

The two radios were out of order; the Cadet radio had a bad condenser and the H.M.V one a burnt transformer. Before he left, he tried to obtain a condenser from India and Egypt, but he did not succeed, but told me to repair the radios, sell them and send him the money. I tried my best to obtain a condenser for the Cadet radio, but as this is an old type of radio and is the only one of this make in Bahrain, I could not get any. I managed to obtain a transformer for the other radio, but the I received a letter from him from Basra, enquiring about the radios and the fan, and I replied to him that I had not been able to get the parts, and as the radios were out of order, nobody would buy theip. Then for a long time I did not hear anything from him, and learnt that he had gone to England. I could not communicate with him, as I did not know his address, but months lathr, Mr.Meikle, the Manager of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. ltd., received a letter from him from England, which he passed on to me. I replied feijc that I had not been able to sell his articles, and I handed over this letter to Mr. Meikle, which he posted it along with his letter to Mr. Pickering.Before receiving this letter from England, I managed to get a customer for the fan for .%.500/“, and I mentioned in my letter that I was hoping to sell the fan for ft:.300/- and send him the money, but, unfortunately, when the customer saw the fan, he did not like it, saying that he wanted it for Persia, and that he would not get good customers for it over there. This happened about 1 three days after I had handed the letter to Mr. Meikle. I wrote to him again, informing^about the fan, and also informed him that I had not been able to get parts for the radios, and that / they were still lying with me. Since then I have not had anymore letters from him. The two radios, the transformer and the fan are in my possession now, and if you wish, I will hand them over to you, as I cannot get any customers for them. owner wanted fis.BOO/-, which ofcourse I could not purchase for this amount.
