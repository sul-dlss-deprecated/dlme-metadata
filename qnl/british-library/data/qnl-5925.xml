Dickson, C.I.E., Acting General Superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company, Limited^ on the subject in which I trust you will find the information you require. Political Agent, Kuwait.Dicicson has received a letter from Abdullah Moola Saleh in which the latter states that the Council of the Kuwait water supply company anticipate a serious shortage of water next summer from 15/7/44 to 15/12/44. The estimated shortage is 4 million gallons of water over the period ( 800,000 gals, per month) and the cause is said to be shortage of craft and the impossibility of obtaining wood and nails for constructing additional craft. abdullah Moolla has asxea if the A.I.O.C. could supply the additional water by the barges which will be sent to Kuwait during the period to load sand. 1 understand from ulcxson’s letter that you had not at that time, been approached in the matter and as, it the tacts given are correct, the position is a serious one, 1 thought it advisable to write to you on the matter. The A.I.O.C. plan to taxe heavy deliveries of sand 1 rom Kuwait throughout the summer ana there will thus be considerable barge traffic but the proposed schedule would not be able to carry more than i or i of the water asxed2 the source of supply might shift; thus I feel that this method of supply is not sufficiently stable to be relied upon. according to my calculations the amount of shortage that the Water Company expects could be carried by 8 to 10 dhows and by far the most satis factory solution of the problem would seem to be to obtain a special permit for the export from Inaia of the amount of teak wood, nails, etc. required for the construction of these craft ana to stipulate that the supply of this material is contingent on the use of the craft for water supply purposes only. with kind regards, C.J.

As far as I can judge ,too f your attitude to the water supply company^ request is justifiable and the alternative remedy proposed the correct one. In fact I have been trying to ;et India to release (inter many alia/ wood for building Kuwait dhows without much success so fax, I’m afraid. Naturally, as the water shortage question was not before me t I nave not so far linked these efforts with any condition that the wood should be used for building water boats.

During conversations with H.H. the Shaikh on 26 - 3-44 the *v A Ruler stated tliat he anticipated a shortage of water throughout the coming sunmer, especially in June, July, August and Septeirtoer and asked if the Company could help to alleviate the position. Mr. Jameson replied that the Company would help in so far as it could but the position was very difficult owing to the fact that so many A.I.O.C. barges had been taken over by the l.Vi.?. for war purposes. The Company would of course, assist so far as laid in its power, by bringing down water in the fore and aft peaks of the bsrges which visit Kuwait to load sand. The writer raised the question of quantities and the difficulty of making any guarantee and His Highness replied that there was no question of guarantees or of fixed quantities, all that he requested was assistance as given on a previous occasion when there was a shortage of water. He on his part would sec that the Kuwait Water Company continued to bring the maximim possible quantity of water to Kuwait. 2 . The position so far as can be foreseen is that at least 10 barge trips per month will be run throughout the summer and it is hoped, if additional tugs become available, to be able to increase this to 15 barge trips per month. £ach barge can carry 100 tons of water » 22,400 gals * 5600 tins, thus it should be possible to bring down a minimum of 224*000 gals per month. Endeavours will be made to obtain a suitable petrol driven punp (Light Fire Trailer type) for punping out the barges and if successful this machine will be sent to the Kuwait Oil Company who will operate and t pa intain it. It will not be possible to delay the turn round of the sand barges and the Kuwait Water Company must be prepared to put their booms alongside the barges inrunedlately they arrive. Barges will put to sea again with their water load if it has not been unloaded by the time they are ready to do so. The Kuwait Water Company will be responsible for punping out the water from the barges but the Kuwait Oil Comf&gt;any will assist in this if they can obtain a suitable power pump. Labour and pumping costs being chargeable to the Kuwait Water Company. The A.I.O.C. will charge for the water delivered to the Kuwait Water Company at the rate of 59 ^ the charge made to the public by the Kuwait Water Company. In view of the assistance rendered to the Kuwait Water Company by this arrangement, the Kuwait Oil Company shall have the right if they desire to exercise it, of punping their water requirements direct from the barges; payment being )aade direct to Messrs. A.I.O.C. This shall be without prejudice to their existing agreement with the Kuwait Water Company to whom no payments will be due for water supplied in this manner. If this scheme is agreed by the Kuwait Water Company endeavours will be made to put it into operation by mid April and to continue till tlie end of October 1944 * Kuwait, 2 $th March, 1944 *Form 7510.

We have go: w i the two letters Nos.309 and 310 dated the 7th October, 1944, received by Your Highness from the Agency, regarding the quantity of timber allowed by the Government of India for the quarter October - December, 1944, which is 1147 tons.

Usual Ending.Under Secretary to the Government of India, E*A # D., New Delhi , No.-2/8. Political Agency, Kuwait, 17th October, 1944. From The Political Agent, Kuwait . To The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Kuwait Water Supply Company. 2. As you know, Kuwait is dependent for drinking water on supplies brought by sea from the mouth of the Shatt-Al-Arab. Prior to 1937, the water was brought in specially built and privately owned water dhows run for private profit; but the profiteering during the sumiiier months become so scandalous that His Highness had the Kuwait Water Supply Company formed, to be run on a no-profit basis to supply drinking water to the public as cheaply as possible. Half the share capital was subscribed by the Kuwait Government and the remainder by leading citizens. The Company acniiired the whole existing fleet of water dhows numbering 48. 3. Unfortunately the new Company was not run very efficiently; and their fleet was allowed to-dwindle until, by 1941, it was insufficient to supply the needs of the town. In 1942 five new water dhows were built; but in 1943 none were added to the fleet, largely because of the ship-building industry’s preoccupation with army contracts for erecting pre-fabricated barges. In 194^1^ owing to the failure to secure sufficient timber from India in/T the 1943-44 sailing season — vide my Express Letter No.1509-^7/45-A dated the 14th October, 1944 —, the Company were not only unable to build any new dhows, but had the greatest difficulty in maintaining those already in commission. The fleet is now reduced to 28 craft. 4. The result has been an acute shortage of drinxing water this summer when winds were light and the already inadeouate number of dho;s were delayed. Had it not been for timely aid given by the Kuwait Oil Company, which ran special water barges from Abadan, the situation would have been infinitely more difficult. As it was, four gallon tins of water w T ere resold this summer for as much as Re.l/- per tin. The Kuwait Oil Company, however, have made it clear that their assistance was given to meet an emergency and cannot be continued indefinitely. 5. It is unlikely that the Water Supply Company will be able to acquire steel barges, or tugs to tow them, until after the war, although applications are being made to the Inland Water Transport, Basrah, for options to buy surplus army equipment as soon as it becomes available. Meanwhile it will be necessary for the Company to rely on locally produced craft. 6 . To meet the situation His Highness has asked me to assist the Company to secure sufficient materials to build ten new water dhows as soon as possible, to make up for those not built in 1943 and 1944. A list of the materials required is attached. 7. Kuwait has a nuota of 1147 tons of timber to be exported from India during the quarter October — December, 1944; and I have already given the recommendations reauired by Foreign Express/mm V 33 Express Letter No.I.91(1)-ME/44 dated the Bth August, 1944, to tiie Kuwait Water Supply Company — vide r y Express Letter No.i509-27/45-A dated the 14th October, 1944. tol 8 . Hitherto Kuwait has had no ruota for sail cloth or for cotton thread for sewing sails. The deep-sea dhows which visit India have been permitted to buy limited quantities of sail cloth in Bombay for re-fitting t ere. The requirements of sail cloth and thread for the fishing and pearling fleets, which do not visit India, will be Included In Kuwait’s Civil Pequirements Programme, and I shall apply for a quota; but I would request that the GrOverni:;ent of India be moved to treat the Kuwait Water Supply Company’s requirements as a special case and to license their requirements for export as scon as possible. 9. The sumo considerations apply to the Company’s requirements of ironware — including Iren bars for making ship’s nails —, anchors, and such other essential gear as compasses, sheaves, and blocks. i n t 0 i /■ t,V Aj 1 [' V ■ 10 . omull quantities of anchors, metal blocks, and con passes have in the past been ordered from England through an agent in Bombay, and shipped direct to Kuwait or via Bombay. I have recently given Import Assistance in respect of a small order for these articles for the use of the deep-sea fleet — vide my Express Letter No.1534-27/45 dated the 17th October, 1944 —; but is not expected that this consignment cun arrive here for another eight months, whereas the Water Supply Company require their compasses and anchors as soon as .possible. 11. Orders for all these articles have, therefore, been placed on the Indian exporters noted in the list of requirements, and it is requested that export licenses may be sent direct to them as soon as possible. IE. Finally, I would request that this case be treated as a whole, as you will appreciate that none of the components of the order are of much use without the remainder. 13. All the materials required for the Kuwait Water Supply Company will be lifted by country craft provided export permits reach the exporters in India by the 31st December, in the case of timber, and by the 31st March, 1945, in the case of the other requirements. 14.

As you no doubt know, to effect a sale to His Highness the Buler of Koweit, it will be necessary to obtain permission of the American Authorities as well as the fer Office. The listed price to us is 90,000 American Dollars which, in my view, is very excessive and is due, no doubt, to the enormous prices of American production costs. We have some requisitioned Tugs which might be made suitable for this work, but I suggest that they would be a matter for private purchase from the Owners. As regards Barges, the only barges we have, have been built for river service only, and I cannot recommend them for use in the manner in which you require them as they would undoubtedly break up in a very short time.

It appears that case for Kuwait timber which includes Water Company’s requirements will be turned down on routine grounds that types of timber required for ship building are required in India for defence purposes. 3. To the extent that such essential cargoes as Kuwait T s civil requirements and most of Basrah date crop for Aden and East African ports are carried in Kuwait dhows to relief of our steamers, maintenance of dhows for which timber required should be regarded as defence purpose. 0n tiiese grounds suggest we press for at least 800 tons and if possible 1155 tons of timber of types already recommended by me, and for 1845 tons — balance of quota — of types 'hot required for defence purposes'. Suitable timber was sanctioned for export in Foreign Express Letter No.3209 March 31st but not lifted as too late in season. . t \ V 5.

Sub-1 ectt- Water - Supply for Kuwaiti Sir, I have the honour to report that His Highness has mentioned verbally to me the question of a water-supply for Kuwait and has intimated that he would be glad to receive tenders from British firms willing to install a distillation plant or plants to utilise as fuel the gas now being burnt off at the fields by the Oil Company. 2. The need for fresh water is one of the most pressing requirements of the town and, now that the State is receiving considerable royalties. Kuwaities will not be satisfied until steps are taken to supply it. If British firms display no interest it is more than likely that American firms will be approached and that, I consider, should be avoided if possible. 3. There is a project on foot, in which many Iraqi capitalists of standing are interested, to lay a water pipe-line from the Shatt-al-Arab to Kuwaitj but I am sure the Shaikh realises the potential danger of Kuwait being dependent on Iraq for so essential a commodity as drinking water. 4. I have the honour to suggest that, in order to forestall Iraqi and American enterprise, British firms of suitable standing should be apprised of the position and should make preliminary surveys in order to show that they are prepared to tender subject to the availability of materials etc. Both Messrs. Holloway Brothers and Wimpeyrf have experience of local conditions in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. . ! i y ft- 5. As the question is one which is liable to effect the Kuwait Oil Company I discussed it informally with Mr Southwell on his last visit here. He gave it as his opinion that there was no British firm that could fulfill an assignment of the magnitude contemplated, and only one American firm. This is called Badgers Limited and has a British subsidiary of the same name. i M.B. I have the honour to be, Sir. Your most obeofent servant, Political Agent, Kuwait. rfeA r~- Q ^IFI^EWTIAL .

It occurs to me, however, that if tha Associated Ethyl Company were to select a site In Kuwait, their operations might be rendered more economical, and the wtate benefit ted equally, if tlm»se operations were combined with the distillation of water to serve the needs of Kuwait. There is probably nothing to this suggestion but it may be worth pursuing, so if you have no objection it could perhaps be brought to tlie notice of the Company. (LCD.) A.C.GALLONAY.

With regard~~ J fc the question of development in Kuv/ait, Sir Rupert informed us that the Shaikh had so far received one instalment of 10 lakhs from the Oil Company and that this sum had already been bespoken for hospitals, customs houses, and other useful projects. He anticipated that these projects which are already on foot would absorb the royalty revenues for the next two years, and that the question of constructing a water supply for Kuwait would not, therefore, become an active one in the immediate future. He envisaged considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary co-operation of the Government of Iraq for such a scheme. Meanwhile, there might be advantage in a&amp;king the Oil Company to ask an engineer to give a preliminary view of the feasibility of the project. There was also scope for port development in Kuwait. Sir Rupert said that the Shaikh intended to keep the royalty revenues under his -personal control, and that he could be trusted not to squander them in an uneconomical manner. * * * * * * * * * dt.29/7/47 Extract from a note/to Mr. E.P.

He was much opposed to it as apart from any political or engineering difficulties it would be too vulnerable. He suggested the distillation of water on a large scale and the use of distilled water mixed with brackish water for irrigation purposes. He hopes that it will be possible to develop an adequate supply of local brackish water supply and stated that one of the Oil Company's experts is at present carrying out a water survey on the Shaikh's behalf - a fact of which I had no previous knowledge. * ******** CONFIDENTIAL 0.1561-S PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY .

Southwell managing director of the Kuwait Oil Company has suggested Badgers (London) Ltd. as being a suitable firm.

Dear Sir, We have received with thanks your letter of the 24 inst., regarding an enquiry received from the Commonwealth Relations Office for Water Distillation Plant for Kuwait. We are most interested in this as Fresh Water Distilling Plant is and has been our speciality since nearly 60 years. We have supplied Fresh Water Distilling Plants to operate from Sea or Brackish Water of capacity a few gallons per hour up to 60,000 gallons per hour. We supplied Hadji Abdulla Alerasa (Sheik of Arabia) with plant of capacity of 20 tons/24 hours which we understand was for his own domestic use. We have also Boiler Plants und/er construction for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company of capacity some hundreds of tons, and other plants for Bahrain, Qatar and various other places in the Middle East. We have also quoted the Kuwait Oil Company for plants. To give you a brief idea of the cost of a plant we give below brief particulars of one recently quoted. This plant has a continuous output capacity of 60,000 imperial gallons per day of 24 hours using sea water from the Persian Gulf. The plant comprisess- Evaporator. Condenser. Coil Drain Cooler. Interconnecting Piping. No Pumping or Boiler Plant. The price for this plant runs about £9,600.O.Od (Nine t housand five hundred pounds ) delivered f.o.b. A Triple Effect Plant of similar capacity would be approximately £12,600.O.Od. ( Twelve thousand five hundred ■Bgundp). The advantage of the Triple Effect Plant is that the steam consumption is appreciably less for the same capacity than the Double Effect. Boiler Plant, Interconnecting Piping etc., is not included in the above figures, but we can supply these if required. It seems to us that a personal discussion would be of great help and undersigned will be pleased to visit you by arrangement. Yours faithfully, for CAIRD &amp; RAYNER, LTD., (SGD.) RENNY B. PINKEY.

Mr. Southwell, Managing Director of the Kuwait Oil Company told me recently that the Shaikh had now apparently abandoned the idea of a distillation plant for Kuwait and had asked the company to enquire about small tinkers to bring water by sea from Iraq. Mr. Southwell said that he thought it was a pity that the distillation plant idea h?d been abandoned as it would have been a better long term solution and it would probably be extremely difficult to find tankers &lt; for the Shaikh, they are however making enquiries. The Company are themselves setting up a distillation plant for their own use. Yours sincerely, Sd/- M. Walker for (B.A.B.

The Shaikh says he has asked Kuwait Oil Company to obtain 3 water tankers for him presumably at his expense. They cost about B.50,000 each. 1 Will P.A.

A &lt;u&gt; /I ^ * n yI spoke to the Shaikh on 29/5 about the necessity for a distillation plant. He had arranped for an order to be placed for one but has cancelled his instructions and has asked the Kuwait Oil Company to procure him some water-tankers instead. The Kuwait Oil Company are erectinp a distillation plant and the Shaikh wants to see whether it is a success, before he orders one. I told hjm that it would take two years to obtain a distillation plant and strongly advised him to order one at once. I pointed out to him the trouble that is being caused in Bahrain by the lack of fore/sipht on the part of the authorities. The population of Kuwait is growing rapidly and serious political discontent would result if there were not sufficient drinking water. The supply of water by tankers or dhows flrom the Shatt-al-Arab is precarious as the Iraqis can always close the river for quarantine and other reasons. I stronply recommended him to obtain both a distillation plant and tankers. He said he would do so. Will p.A, Kuwait please ascertain in a few weeks what action he has taken and let me have a reuort. I also discussed the water question with Mr. Kemp who fully agreed with me about the necessity for ordering a distillation plant at once. It should be sufficient to supoly 500,000 gallons a day and should be capable of expansion. He said that no water tankers were readily available and discussed the possibility of adapting some ordinary vessels for the purpose .

After Compliments, The question of supplying Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation has all along been a disturbing feature which makes it necessary for those concerned to find a successful solution. We recently had the opportunity of taking up this vital matter, which Your Highness greatly appreciates and which is of great benefit, and we decided to place our services and experiences at Your Highness* disposal for fulfilling this purpose. We have formed a Sandika, which is made up equally of Iraqis and Kuwaitis and have started the work by delegating Yusuf Ahmed al Ghanim , who is a member of the Sandika. to have the honour of meeting Your Highness and to make certain that Your Highness is prepared to support this vitally important scheme. Yusuf has informed the Sandika that Your Highness had agreed in principal to us supplying Kuwait with water, according to its requirements, and to construct a special pipe-line from the Shatt-al-Arab to Kuwait. The Sandika have decided to approach Your Highness requesting, you to give your final consent, so that they can communicate with the Iraqi Authorities for permission to take water from the Shatt-al-Arab and supply it continuously to Kuwait, so as to ensure that the water supply will not be stopped at any future date. I therefore have the honour to submit a few points on which this scheme* depends, and hope that they will meet with Your Highness* approval and be acceptable to Your Highnes: so that w e may be able to start immediately with the work of getting the other requirements 1. Supplying Kuwait with all the water required through the pipe-line. 2. That an understanding be cached in the fixing of the price of water to be supplied, so that the amount of money utilised in this pr 6 ject could be recovered by the Company at a reasonable pc? profit af not more than 25/T of the capital amount. 3. To complete all possible means for the security of supplying water from the Shatt-al-Arab with the consent of the Iraq Government, and to produce sufficient securitj according to the principals followed Internationally. 4 . To complete the scheme and supply Kuwait with water within a period of five years from the date of complet ing the legal proceedings regarding the concession in Kuwait and the final approval of the Iraq Government. 6 . The period of the concession to be one hundred (100) years, beginning from the date of Your Highness* approval and agreement on the scheme. The Kuwait Government wrill not allow any other company or individual whether Commercial or official to carry out a similar project which would interfere with our Company* s work. 6 . The Kuwait Government should offer all facilities required by our Company for carrying out the scheme, that is to exempt all machinery, materials etc. imported by the Company from Custom duties and taxes or any other dues.7. Your Highness* Palace and private gardens will be supplied with water free of cost during the period of the concession. This includes the value and expenses of constructing the pipe-line and its requirements. 8. Our company undertakes to allot 10$ of their net profit and to offer it either to the Kuwait Government or to the Kuwait Municipality, according to Your Highness* wishes. 9. At the expiry of the concession, all the company*s machinary and tools will belong to the Kuwait Munici pality without pajcment. 10. To have the Kuwait Water Supply Company registered as a general company in Kuwait and that the Kuwaitis will enjoy the right of subscribing in the Capital amount upto 50$ .

The refer ence is presumably to item 3 in the application which does not appear to contain a very satisfactory guarantee as it stands. 2. The last reference to this project is contained in a report received from the Political Agent Kuwait which I forwarded to the Commonwealth Relations Office under my endorsement No. 285-S of the 30th January 1948. It will be seen from that report that the Shaikh would only give his permission for the scheme if His Majesty^ Government were to guarantee the observance by the IraQi Government of a promise not to interrupt the supply of water for any reason whatever. This is clearly impossible and I am instructing the Political Agent Kuwait to ignore the present indirect approach made by the Shaikh and to report further should hh bring the subject himself after Ramadhan. My own view is that there would be no great harm in the project concerned being put into effect entirely as a private enterprise provided (a) it is clear ly understood that His Majesty's Government will not accept any responsibility for obtaining the Iraqi Govern ment's approval to it or ensuring the observance of any undertakings which that Government may enter into regard ing it, and (b) the Shaikh of Kuwait pursues the proposal for the erection of a distillation plant, c.f. my s.o. letter No. 88 of the 16th June 1948 to Mr. Burrows, v so that Kuwait will have an adequate supply of drinking water should the project either not materialise or subsequently fail. 3.

Our people, especially the poor classes, are experiencing great difficulties in meeting the high expenditure of water. We understand from a reliable source that the Water Supply Company here has bought, or are about to buy a large ship, able to carry 60,000 tins, for /300,000/-. When this ship arrives here, the problem of fresh water will definitely be eased. Even then, we still hold to the opinion that the water problem will not be solved in a such a way that the public can depend on it, unless the responsible authorities here undertake the responsibility of reaching an understanding with the Iraq Government for a pipe line from Shat-al- Arab. The generous Iraq always welcome any understanding and co-operation with the other parts of the Great Arab Country, and Iraq has proved this on every occasion during his history. We do not imagine that any one can convince us that the scheme of carrying water by steamers will succeed, becanse besides the fact that it will be more expensive than the pipe line scheme, it will not meet our country’s requirements of fresh water. Those who are interested in the matter should not forget to look for ward and consider the future of this country, its anti cipated growth and the building of several new towns in the operational areas. They should also consider the surprising change in the life of Kuwait inhabitants and their particular interest in regard to cleanliness. We conclude with our submission to the real fact that Kuwait is in need of Shatt-al-Arab, whether by means of steamers or a pipe-line.From Political, Kuwait. Prodrome, Bahrain.

The Shaikh has now confirmed that two water tankers have been bought for him by the Company, and should be in operation by September.

Dear Political Residency, Your letter No. 117 (53/47) of the 22nd July, about the proposed piped water supply from the Shatt-el-Arab to Kuwait. 2. It is difficult for us to comment on the advantages of a piped water supply as against a distillation plant in the absence of details as to the initial and running costs of the tw o projects and the throughput of fresh water which can*l be expected from the pipe-line and from the distillation plant. We presume, however, that the latter would run on oil and afford more security than the pipe-line. 3. If the Shaikh asks your advice as to the type of guarantees which the Shaikh and the Company should obtain we suggest that he might be advised that guarantees on the following general lines would be desirable :- (a) a guarantee given by Iraq by international agreement not to interrupt or interfere with or allow on Iraqi territory any interruption or interference with the water supply in time of peace or of war; (b) a guarantee by the Company to maintain the water supply at all times and in the event of their failure to do so, the Shaikh of Kuwait should have the right to take over and operate the supply. His Majesty*s Government could not of course undertake to ensure the fulfilment of either of these guarantees, though it would of course be for us to negotiate (a) if it was decided to ask for it.

Deer Chancery, At a recent meeting with representativee of the Kuwait Oil Company, the latter expressed some anxiety regarding their dependence on the goodwill of Iraq for their fresh water supplies* This is, of c urse, no new situation but as they and the Kuwait Government are new fitting out a number of water tankers of approximately 1,000 tons each, they fear that the number of large vessels, as opposed to the former country craft, which will be operating in Iraqi waters may result in the Iraqi Government paying more attention to this matter than they have in the past. They have therefore asked us to explain the position to you so that, in the event of objection bwing raised, you wo Id know the general background and be ready to represent their case without loss of time. They have also asked that the situation may be explained to the United States Embassy so that they also may be ready to act with you should necessity arise. Briefly then, the situation is that, since no adequate source of fresh water has yet been found at Kuwait, both the townspeople and the Kuwait Cil Company will continue to be dependent an supplies of fresh water from the Shatt al Arab until alterm tive arrangements, such as the installation of evaporator plants, are made. So far as the Kuwait Oil Company is conceraed, it is anticipated that evaporator plant to meet their needs will be installed at Kuwait by the first half of 1950. Between now and then the Company will have to continue to import fresh water from the Shatt si Arab by a fleet of water tankers. In all, some 7 vessels will be employed for this purpose and the total number of trips each month to the Shatt al ^rab by these ships will be approximately 56 * After the evaporator plant has been installed, the number of water tankers will be reduced to one or two, which will be retained as a precautionary measure. Although the Company is not directly concerned with supplies of fresh water for the town of Kuwait, they have recently purchased two water vessels for the Kuwait Government and it is possible that a further vessel of this type may be acquired by the uler in the near future. The number of trips to the Shatt al Arab made each month by water tankers belonging to the Kuwait Government will be approximately 21, and the total number of trips made each month by the water vessels of both the Company and the Kuwait Government will be about 77* The displacement of each of these ships will be in the neighbourhood of 1,000 tons. Should oil companies operating in the Kuwait- Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone also require to import fresh water from this source, the number of vessels carrying fresh water from the Shatt would, of course, be substantially increased. e are sending copies of this letter to Bahrein and KOwelt.

CONF(l&gt; h - s 1 tAi ' Please refer to ray letter (161/2/48) the 14th October. I understood during ray recent visit to Kuwait that the Shaikh is unwilling to pro ceed with the proposal for the erection of a distillation plant because he hopes that the Kuwait Oil Company will find an adequate supply of drinking water in Dibdiba. I think members of the Company have informed me that there is no real hope of finding a good supply of drink ing water anywhere in Kuwait territory and I imagine that they are now proposing to drill a bore in Dibdiba under pressure from the Shaikh. Would you kindly let me know when the work is likely to be put in hand and whether the consider that there is any prospect ofPERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN. 16th November 1948. / (161/6/48) The Kuwait Oil Company are extremely worried about the drinking water situation at Kuwait, and are think ing of making tentative arrangements for its supply from Bahrain in case if for any reason the supply from Iraq is cut off before their distillation plant is ready. 7&lt;hen I was in London, the management of the Company informed me that they contemplated sending a small water tanker to Bahrain some time this cold weather experimentally. I have mentioned the matter informally to Belgrave who said he thought there would be no objection to the Kuwait Oil Company^ obtaining drinking water from Bahrain, should they at any time wish to do so. He said that the Petroleum Concessions Limited draw supplies of drinking water from a stand-pipe in the sea somewhere off Muharraq, and sugges ted that the Kuwait Oil Company might obtain water from the same source. 2.

I have spoken to the Shaikh on the subject of the drilling of a water well at Dibdiba, and he tells me that Schofield told him that a bore would be completed by the Company within one year. 3. Reference to the Company provided the information that the Company ar* intending to bore somewhere in the south west border of the State but that water, if found, will be for their use. It seems at this stage the best course would be to press the Company to get on with drilling the well, and if water is found to arrange equal distribution later. 4.

Quantities throughout nr© stated in imperial . gallons. For convenience, the conclusions and recorynendations ore given first, followed by the details. CONCLUSIONS 1. The southeastern quarter of Kuwait territory been adequately explored for ground water. Further work sliould bo^donc in the aouthwestsm cu&amp;rtor and northern, half of the area ^-c ^ ground^water search is to be considered thorough, but a review ox the ground-water situation in other parts of the region cuggoscs that little improvement over th© boat water already icund m r.uwcac- territory can be expected. 2. The upp&lt;er limestone still, appears to b© the oest water-bearing formation available in Kuwait, but there is ^yle assurance that water better tljan that found in wet or we. J- 6 vi be discovered. The proof, hovavor, is in test -drillingo 3k, The water in the upper limestone should be besi at ^ sites nearest to the intake area or n fotuntain-head'. of the pie some trie or 'pressure” surface for water in t^c .,^.ewu-'.. is p’snorally northward and the water must thereiore move nor o.av.^i the 'fountain-he^d” must U.o to the south. Hence the unexp.-oroo part of Kuwait that is vest likely tc yield water of good qualify is the southwest. A. Although failure to find good water in the ‘JP?®; stone in the .extreme southwest reduces the likel£*iooa o.-indir^ i f ood water from it anywhere in the territory, two or Should be drilled to the upner limestone in northern Kuwait on ,-c slim nossib^ 11 ty that water' reaching that locality comes xroma more favorable intake ai‘oa or through a less mineralised portion of the formation. 5 . highly mineralised waters found in tho upper limostoiio hong the Persian Gwlf and ovor thoight to to H-nwtoae uatoro r.ontaidnatod by brineB fo.oea a»ard throu^ -V.atB and roxa.aa to arch. aWalisation HwoT-yad iaipe ^riUcas of selb cad tho - minerals, but only aeall adniiflons ox eulxsue.6* The azncmnt of mlnei'al matter In the voter of the upper Haeatone is not obviously related to the depth to the lia©stone j nor to the altitude of the limestone j nor to the depth to the static water level; nor to the total depth of the wells; nor to the .thickness of the producing aone. The sulfate in the water seems to be less where the altitude of the static water level is high — i.©., at locations nearer to the intake area — but even this correlation is not one hundred per cent clear 0 7. The lower limestone, which has been rejected &amp;c a possible source of potable water, has been tested at only two locations, both on the Burgsn arch, where tho upper limestone also is hopelessly mineralised* At least ono hole should be drilled into the lower limestone at a location removed from tho Burgan arch preferably in southwestern Kuwait. 8. The quantity of water stored in tho lime at ones is very great, and probably will last many years at tho consumption rate now contomplated, if the full thickness of tho limestones can be developed. 9* Wadi al Batin offers the greatest opportunity for rain water to enter alluvial sands, and should bo tesoed. 10. Alluvial sands that have accumulated on low flats belov/ the Jal es Zor ere probably too thin and too limited in extent to contain much water, and the wadi.es that might feed water to them have drainage areas too small. Additi-onal native wells might be developed, but not the quantity of water desired by the Kuwait Oil Company. The area need not be tested. 11. Alluvial sands in wadies draining into Khor Subiya may soak up rain water and help replenish tho ground water, but the volume of water ie probably inadequate for any but natuvo veils. .The area noed not be tested. 12. The Dibdibba beds and the Kuwait series may have the effect of c single water-bearing formation, where both arc present. The waters of the Kuwait series have been rejected as too ninerc.l~.scd* but they have been tested principally in southeastern Kuwait. They should be logged and campled wherever penetrated by wells intended. to test the deeper formations. A large basin on tho back slope o^. the Jal es Zor, where replenishment may occur, is especially, rc- coamncmded for a test. 13. The Cretaceous sands are practically’' certain vo conc-a:.n highly mineralised water. Test drilling - B worth wnile. 14. In Kuwait, the rainfall, reservoir replenishment, and safe yield are probably so low that the ground water^may considered as an exhaustible resource, to be mod while it ~c.c^c and then supplanted by another supply* The upper liras tone may even crop out on the surface in the area south of Kuva-t whence the water seems to come, hence may receive replenis-nmert only indirectly through formations above or below. 15* The skimming of fresh vrater that ‘-floats 0 on selo ^ water is not likely to work on a .large scale nor for a protracted period in Kuwait, primarily because the rate of grounn-vauer replenishment is too low, and probably ^ E0 , billty of the formations where It Eight to tried.

Less than half of the waters in Iraq represented by analyses from the files of the Basrah Petroleum Company can be considered potableo 17© Test-drilling and water sampling and testing pro cedures are discussed. Although seme good work has been done on changes in mineral content of the water in the Kuwait series with increasing depth, more should be done, and nothing is known about mineral content as related to depth (i.e., roughly strati graphic position) in the upper limestone© Only waters above an unconformity within the upper limestone appeal' to have been sampled© mocmmDkTims . Seven principal test-sites are recommended, with supple mentary procedure if good results are obtained (fig© l)© If results at all seven sites are unsatisfactory, it may safely be concluded that sufficient potable ground water is not available in Kuwait territory, unless the drilling reveals some hitherto unsuspected possibility that deserves a test© The seven sites are designated by roman numerals to differentiate them from tests already drilled, which have been designated by arable numerals, and from test-sites previously proposed but not drilled, vhich have been designated by letters. There is little to choose between sites I and II, and II can be done first if deal-red, but they offer more than sites III -VII which should come later. Sites III and IV can be drilled in reverse order, but are worth more than sites V-VII. The proposed sites make a less regular pattern than that followed in previous test-drilling, having been chosen partly with regard to topographic situations and partly to test the greatest number of potential water-bearing formations© In southwestern Ku wait : 1© KOC coordinate N 40,000 - E 10,000, about 2.5 miles north of boundary with Saudi Arabia© To test the upper limestone as near to the n fountain-head' as possible and about halfway between tlie westernmost previous test well and the southwestern corner of the state; to test also the Dibdibba beds and Kuwait series. , and the lower limestone (unless it is found more economical to redrill the area of water well 6 to test the lower limestone)« g&gt; If satisfactory water in quantity is found in the Kuwait series or Dibdibba beds, drill additional wells at intervals of 1 mile to north, east, and west, to outline the area with good water. b© If satisfactory water in quantity is found in either the upper or the lower limestone, drill additional wells at intervals of 5 miles to north, east, and west to determine areal extent of good water.

This report is based mainly on the large volume of work done on the water-supply problem by 'the resident geologists of the Kuwait Oil Company, who have studied and sampled the native water supplies and have follwad the water-well drilling closely* In addition to recording essential facts for each well drilled, they have prepared progress reports interpreting results achieved, the most important being: SaSwi, L a , Memorandum:'Water investigation', 7 May, 1939 File GD/4 Cass, L«, Memorandum: 61: 'Water investigation', 29 January 1940* File GD/4 Saso, L*, Memorandum:'Kuwait water search', 2 April, 1941* File GD/4 * . - Sass, L., Memorandum to Mr, E*S* Bleecker:'Kuwait water search'. 24 June 1941-.* File GD/4 Sass, L», Memorandum to Mr. E,S* Bleecker: 'Kuwait water search - Tentative program for further drilling', 17 July 1941 File GD/4 Cunts, H.A 0 , Memorandum 59: 'Kuwait water search - Generalized discussion of results so far obtained together with a recommended program for further drilling'* 22 Jure 1942* File GD/4 Guntz ; K.Ao, 'Water in the vicinity of Kuwait Town', 11 July 1942.

The work done to date has shown clearly that little truly good ground 'water is to be had in southeastern Kuwait, and this part of the territory — south of A1 Jahrah and east of coordinate E 40,000 — may be considered as sufficiently explored.. As this is the area of highest demand for water, it is apparent that only the less desirable and more remote southwestern quarter and northern half of 'the territory deserve exploration. The probably high pumping lifts and long pipe lines involved in the development of these remote areas are obvious drawbacks, but it seems futile to test the southeast quarter further. The untested areas,* for that matter, offer little real hope for an adequate supply of potable water, but only test drilling of format! ons and analysing of waters will prove tho point.- 6 ~ QDASWCT KBQmHHffiSTS MB OTAT.TTT STANTWPS i V According to present plans Of the Kuwait Oil Company, « total of about 1*6 million imperial gallons per day will be required to meet all company uatoi* needs and to augment the water supply of Kuwait town| when the company demand reaches its peak. This is * divided as follows:* differs from place to place according to what water is available, but beyond certain concentrations of mineral matter, water is non-potable in any land.

Th© natives have not ovcrlcokod this possibility. In the wadi that passes itssediatoly to the cast of the Bohrah well and about 0.5 Mle ^upetrean' fresa the woll, they have dug about 25 wells. Five of them were observed within a radius of about 15 feet on 4 ^ovomeor 1947, when the water level in some of them was estimated as 10 to 20 feet bel^ the surface. A few were dry and come had only a SW-I puddle covering part of the bottom. Although awim^l droppings showed that this water place had been much used, it was deserted, perhaps because the water had declined so much that the wells no longer contained enough to dip out. Tho effect of despexiing th© welle is problematical. They penetrate a considerable thickness of alluvial send fcelativ© to the size of the channel, am perhaps are bottomed on bed rock, in which case deepening would bo useless. A wadi similar to that described above empties onto e. vride flat just southwest of the Bahxah camp buildings. It might bo developed into a native watering-place, but the volume of alluvial sand is probably too email to contain more than a limited supply of water. A rmiftll canyon with a sandy channel about 12' miles southwest of the Bahrah well heads just behind the Jal es Zor oscarpsnent and omptioo on the low flat at approximate KOC coordinates JT 82,000 - E 82,000. As its area is only about 2 square mil os, tt offers only a slight opportunity for accumulation of water, which probably is near enough to the land surface to bo subject to wastage by evaporation. Conditloos along the Jal os Zor are a far cry from those in scffie parts of tho western United States where high mountains induce rains that send substantial volumes of water down the canyons to disappear into coarse alluvial fans of the piedmont area good aquifers, abundantly replenished despite low rainfall oft their immodiato surface.

Ths fracturing and faulting of the Burgan structure provide the required openings, and where these have not been sealed by bitaEan or sulfur, the deep highly mineralized waters can move upward into the limestone. On reaching the impervious charty cap of tho limestone the ri sing waters would tend to spread in all directions but mostly they would be carried along by the movement of the water in the limsstona - from the area of high hydrostatic pressure to lower hydrostatic pressure, that is, from Borgan toward the Persian Golf« Therefore, tho msoasiiEG contamlaation of the limestone waters should occur on the east aid® of the structure, and within a relatively short distance to the west there should be normal, uncontaminated limestone waters. The logical conclusions from this line of reasoning, unfortunately, are that the waters of wells 6, 9, 13,. 14, 15 end 16 represent the normal mineral concentration in the water from the limestone, and therefore, that little improvement in water quality can be expected farther afield* Problems raised ? Several circumstances that might throw doubt on this explanation of the highly mineralized waters may be ewnaed U|&gt; in the following questions * a* Why is the limestone water from wells on tho Burgas areh not more highly rdnaraliaed ? Only in Burgan wells 1, 3, and 6 does the mineral content approach that of water of the Persian Gulf, whereas the most mineralized waters were found in wells near the sea* At the outset, it is clear that the deep brines will cause the greatest conta mination at places whore they enter the limestone la largest volume * Directly over the Burgan arch, many of the fractures have been closed by deposition of sulfur and bitumen, leaving only small openings still off active, and even these say not be very close to the wells for which ana lyses were made. On the other hand, deposition of the hitmen end perhaps also of sulfur, may not have oocurred at all down tho oast flank beyond the oil-saturated area* Fractures or faults which at depth are in tho Burgan field may lead diagonally upward to intersect the upper lime at on© off the top of the structure, thus conducting the brines to such location® as water wells 11 and 19. /-Tho fatalt found in suIfTir test hoi® 4 was visualised aa n &amp; hinged ovorthruat striiin,^ northeast and southwest .... the saovemcnt (being) nearly horizontal« M This fault seesis to fit the requirs- iaents.

If withdrawal of water artificially throxigh veils dries up the springs and streaxas to some extent, the matter may not be serious* The natural discharge may only have been diverted to artificial discharge without affecting the balance between in-put and out-go. This amounts to salvaging or harvesting the natural discharge that otherwise might flow to waste, and the amount that can be sl&amp;Viiged, without dipping into si orage-vatar, is the safe yield of the reservoir* The eofe yield cannot exceed the replenish ment, or rechargeo Applied to Kuwait territory, these principles moan that large withdrawals of ground water will sooner or later cause per- naient decline in water levels or artesian pressure because the safe yield of the ground-water reservoir will be exceeded, necessitating the pumping of water that my be considered as Sstored®, like the prtiicipal in a bank deposit 0 That the safe yield is low is evident froi?. the low rainfall of Kuwait and surrounding areas. Meteorological records fur Kuwsit are of short duration, hut the rainfall data maintained by the company at Shuwaikh, Fahaheal, and Arnnadi are suggest!vo* At Shuwaikh between July 1, .1945 and June 30 , 1946 , rainfall was 8*13 inches j and at Ahmadi and Fahaheel for the year Jul 7 / 1, 1946 through June 30, 1947, it averaged about 2*7 incheso For the two years of record, the a rage rainfall was 5*41 indies, wMch may be far from ropresenta ■ tive on account of the seemingly high rainfall recorde^l at Shuwaikh. There is no apparent way of estimating the rainfall at inland loerlions. It probably is much less. Of the rain that reaches the gyound, a large part is promptly evaporated into the atmosphere because of the prevailing high temperatures. A small part of it sinks into the soil and is i sed by the deseri plants, and in cool weather some of the water from a heavy sinks below the plant roots to the water table* Only along the coast does any of the rain go into the sea as run-off. Wh &amp;6 fraction of the rain actually reaches the ground- water reservoirs cannot be determined in a month or ai.x months, but a comparison can be made* In the High Plains of New Mexico, Texas.; Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska, where the annual rainfall ranges from 8 or lo inches to 20 inches or more, the current estimates of recharge average about 1 inch per year. The recharge in Kuwait is likely to be much less* It will, of course, be uneven — perhaps several inches in a depression or wadi, but nothing at all somewhere else. The native wells seem to take advantage of the places receiving more than average recharge* The fact that they become saline or go dry in late summer indicates that the amount of recharge is small. /-Yh© rains that fall within the ‘boundaries of Kuwait territory isay recharge the Dibdibba beds and Kw&amp;it series,, or the allirrial sands along the wadies, but', they probably do not contri bute water to the upper Jinestone because of tha iiapervious chert cap of the limestone and the clsfr beds above it« i‘he upper liifio- stone may receive water iroia ra^n on its surface where it crops ou in Iraq, but to the south, whence the water reaching Kuwait seems to come, the limestone is overlapped, and has no surface exposure* Therefore it can be replenished only indirectly, (&amp;) through the overlying formation, which seems unlikely, or (b) from underlying formations carrying artesian water. water in Kuwait are poor, hence the safe annual yield is probably small. Accordingly, it should be recognise’! that large withdrawals of ground water ultimately will deplete the reservoir, and when this happens the business, industry, and population that have expanded on the ihssis of ample water may suffer. least the volume of wato:&gt; stored in the limstones is great. Thu upper limestone totals about 550 feet, excluding a 25 -foot shale at tho bottom , and if the porosity is assumed to be only 1 per cent — a ridiculously low figure when the good yields of the producing wells are considered — there should be 9^7,350,000 gallons of water per cquare mile. The upper limestone under 59 square miles should contain enough water to last 100 years at the rats of 1 0 6 million gallons per day. 100 feet of limestone per square mile. Thus if only the upper 100 feet of limestone were developed, the limestone under 340 square miles should contain enough water to last 100 years at 1.6 million gallons per day. exhaustible resource, like oil, the upper limestone contains enough for many years and might as well be used while it lasts. the worst that may be expected from the search for ground water in Kuwaito Bahrain Island, and Qatar Peninsula, and water analyses ware borrowed from the Basrah Petroleum Company. of the ground water in eastern Arabia and Iraq is more mineralized than the best water found to date in the upper limestone in Kuwait (water well 6 ), and only locally is there an abundance of water that is better.

On several occasions mention had been made in the Iraqi press of the desire of Kuwait to draw drinking water from the Shatt al Arab. It was proposed that a pumping station would be established at Fao which was to be erected either by Kuwaitis themselves or by Iraq with funds to be obtained by loans from Kuwaitis. But when the water came up for discussion, there appeared to be certain reser vations to the scheme with which Iraq found it hard to comply. These were introduced by the British Political Agent at Kuwait. The reservations in question were (a) that Iraq should re nounce all claims to certain places in the boundary area near Safwan (b) that the tribes wandering between Kuwait and Basrah are to be considered subjects of Kuwait who should be accorded special treatment, and (c) that the control of the scheme shall be in the hands of Kuwaitis alone, and that Iraq should guarantee the supp-ly of fresh water to Kuwait under any circumstance whatsoever. o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-■■ **: / \i.
