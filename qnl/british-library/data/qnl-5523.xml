Dear In connection with the Dedication Ceremony of the Sandhurst Memorial Chapel on Sunday, the 2nd May next, the Commandant has notified General Wilson that, while he regrets that no seats in the Chapel can he allotted owing, to lack of space to the families or friends of Regimental representatives, he proposes to have the service relaid to sears provided outside the Chapel, or, in the event of inclement weather, in one of the College buildings. Should you wish for any such tickets would you inform me as soon as possible. The total allotment of such tickets for the Indian Army representatives works out at only one each.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 1st July, 1942. (K 7146/909/254 ) Dear Jhancery, Your despatch No.71 of the 7th March regarding the appointment of Captain Tandy to Meshed. It is assumed that Captain Tandy*s appointment as additional Vice-Consul was made under the general authority held by the Government of India, for the duration of the war, to incur expenditure on any one item within a maximum of £1,000 a year. It would be a great help to all concerned in London, if this department could be kept informed of all consular moves and appointments including those of Indian Political Service in Persia. Would you, therefore, kindly ask consular posts in Persia always to furnish reports to you giving full particulars of appointments for early transmission home. Yours ever, Consular Department, The Chancery, British Legation, Tehran.Ext.3005/42. Ref: K 3962/909/234 /OrV ORoreiqn office S.W.l. 5th June 1942. I ara directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, from which it will he seen that Captain M.P. O.C. Tandy assumed charge as British Vice-Consul at Meshed on the 16th February last. 2. As Mr. H.A.N. Barlow, whose appointment to Meshed was the subject of correspondence with the India Office last year (see I n dia Office letter EXT 5629/41 of the 12th September and earlier correspondence), also assumed duty at Meshed on the 25th February last, it would appear that Mr. Tandy's appointment as Vice-Consul is in excess of the authorised establishment of the post. 3. I am therefore to enquire whether it is intended that Imperial Funds should meet the usual moiety of the cost involved in the appointment of a second Vice-Consul to Meshed. 4. It will be seen from India Office letter EXT 4144/41 of the 31st July last enclosing a copy of a telegram No.3625 of the 18th July, 1941, from the Government of India, that the proposals made therein, to place certain I n dian political officers in consular posts in Persia, were to be reviewed in the spring of 1941, and I am accordingly to request that the Government of India may now be asked to report on the necessity for the continuance of these posts. 5. Finally, with reference to Foreign Office letter /of The Under-Secretary of State India Office.tH -(6 of the 13th October, 1941, No. K 10474/7113/234, I am to enquire whether the transfer of Lieutenant R.E.Hodson, to take up the post of Vice-Consul at Kerman, was proceede&lt; / ^“ with and if so, the date on which he assumed duty there, in order that steps may be taken to appoint him in the usual manner.

Shrine has been appointed in his place as Consul General for Khorasan at Meshed. r, Mr. Shrine was previously Resident for the Punjab States, and recently accompanied ReXa Shah to Mauritius. At Lahore he drew the pay of a Resident, Second Class, with allowances, the whole amounting to approximately Rs. 3.628* If,at Meshed,he were to draw Second Class Resident's pay as well a.s full allowances he would then receive approximately 3,928,^ 'v/hich the Government of India consider to the excessive. They propose therefore to pay him as a Second Class Resident, together with unspecified allowances of Rs. 223, which would amount to approximately Rs. 3,400 and would thus equal time-scale pay plus full allowances.
