MAKEIAGES abroad between persons of whom both are British subjects, or of whom one is a British subject,«can be solemnized either— ' (a.) Under 'The Foreign Marriage Act, 1892,' and 'The Foreign Marriages Order in Council, 1913,' at one of His Majesty's Consulates where the law ^of the country does not forbid such marriages ; or, in very special circum stances, at one of His Majesty's Embassies or Legations. {Marriages under the Foreign Marriage Act are 'prohibited in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States of America, and Venezuela. In these countries they can only take place according to the local law) or — (h.) According to local law. -2. If 'one of the parties is a subject or citizen of the country in which the (I, (l) (c) marriage is to take place, then the marriage cannot be solemnized by or before a and ( c 0- )* marriage officer under the Foreign Marriage Act unless— (a?) It can be shown that sufficient facilities do not exist for the solemnization of the marriage according to local law ; or, (h.) The man about to be married is a British subject and the woi^ian a subject or citizen of the country, and the marriage officer is satisfied that no Q^bject«on will be taken by the authorities of the country to r jhe solemniza tion of the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act. / Any person may appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal to celebrate his or her marriage based on the absence of either of the above requirements. 3. Naturalized British subjects, when within the limits of any State of which they were previously subjects or citizens, are not considered British subjects for the purposes of the Foreign Marriage Act unless they can show that they have divested themselves of the nationality of such State. The marriage of a naturalized British subject with a person other than a natural born British subject cannot be solemnized by or before a marriagefbfficer until the latter has obtained the sanction of the Secretary of State. Part II.— Consular Marriages. Formalities to he gone through. 1. Both parties desiring to be married by a marriage officer must comply with the requirements of the Foreign Marriage Act and of the Foreign Marriages Order in Council, 1913, as regards residence and notice, viz. :— (1.) They must both reside within the district of the marriage officer by or before whom the marriage is to be solemnized for three weeks immediately pre ceding the marriage ; or, (2.) One party must reside in that district, but the other party may reside elsewhere. • When neither party has so resided the marriage cannot be solemnized unless the O 4 -) marriage officer about to officiate is satisfied (a) that the marriage cannot convenient!}' be solemnized under the Foreign Marriage Act at the place where either of the parties has had his or her usual place of abode; or (6) that the permission of the Secretary of State has been obtained. Special provision is made for such cases (see b^low, Part II, 1 (iii) ) — (i.) Where both parties are residing within the district of the marriage officer concerned, one of the parties must, after one week's residence, give to such „ officer two weeks' notice. No notice need be given by the other party. (ii.) When one party so resides he must, after one week s residence, ^ive two (8.) weeks' notice, as in (i). * Part (A) is based upon 'The Foreign Marriage Act, 1892,' and 'The Foreign Marriages Order in CounciL 1913,' copies of which can be obtained from Messrs. Wyman and Son, Ketter Lane, E.C. The references in the margin are to the relevant clauses in the latter.The other party need not give notice, but must fulfil the requirements as to residence in one of the following ways, according to the Regulations in. force in the particular locality in which he or she happens to be. He or .she must, within the three months immediately preceding the marriage, reside • (or have his or her usual place of abode) either— («•) In the United Kingdom. In this case the party must,' after one week's residence, give three weeks' notice to the Registrar, as if he or she were about to be married in the United Kingdom, (The publication of banns is not in England or Ireland sufficient notice.) In Scotland banns must be published, and a certificate of the proclamation of such banns obtained from the Session Clerk : or ( 12 -) (b.) In the district of some marriage officer abroad. In th.s case the party must, after one week's residence, give two-weeks' notice, as in (i), to the marriage officer of that district, as if h^ or she were about to be married before him : or (10.) (c.) In a British Dominion or Colony, or in India. In this case the party shall give notice to the proper officer, in accordance with. qi .) any law of that part of His Majesty's Dominions giving effect to ' the Order in Council, 1913, or in like manner as if the party were to be married in that place : or ( 13 -) (d.) In a place in a foreign country or British protectorate which is not within the district of a marriage officer. 'In this case the party must, after one week's residence, give two weeks' notice, as in (i), to any person who may be authorized by-the Secretary of State to receive such notices. ( 14 *) (iii-) ^ neither party has so resided, both parties must go through the for nalities prescribed above for the non-resident party, according as (a), (6), (c), (d) may apply in his or her particular case, and one party must give notice to the marriage rfficer by or before whom the marriage is to be solemnized in the form given in Form No. 1 of the Schedule to the Order in Council. In all cases under (ii) and (iii) the Registrar or marriage officer, or specially authorized person receiving the notice, will deal therewith, and, on payment of the proper fee, issue a certificate for marriage, the production of which will be required by the marriage officer by or before whom the marriage is about to be solemnized. 2. The marriage must be solemnized within three months after the date on which the notice for it has been given to and entered by the marriage officer about to officiate. Any form of ceremony may be used at the solemnization of the marriage at the official house of the marriage officer, provided that the ceremony, if not held according to the rites of the Church of England, contain the pronouncement of the words specified in section 8 (3) of the Foreign Marriage Act, 1S92. The religious part of the ceremony may be performed by a clergyman or minister of any denomination, but the presence of the marriage officer is absolutely necessary, and it is the civil and not the religious part of the ceremony which alone gives validity to the marriage. Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that, owing to some good cause, either or both of the parties to an intended marriage have not been able to comply with the requirements as to notice of the Foreign Marriages Order in Council, 1913, and is satisfied that the intended marriage is not clandestine, and that adequate notice has been given, he may give permission for the intended marriage to be solemnized. Application tor such dispensation should be made direct by the party or parties concerned to the Secretary of State, and the reasons for such application fully stated, unlep3 they are residing at or near the place of residence of the marriage officer bv or befcve whom the marriage would be solemnized, in which case the application should be made through that marriage officer. This dispensation, however, is not contemplated and cannot be given in cases where difficulties have arisen owing to the negligence of the parties to inform themselves in sufficient time and with sufficient care of the requirements of the Act and Order in Council. (-•) . marriage between a British subject and a foreigner is not necessarily valid m the country to which the foreigner belongs, unless the local requirements of that country have also been complied with. Where the woman is a British subject and the man a foreigner, as contemplated in Part I, 2 (a), the marriage officer must be satisfied—3 (a.) That the marriage will be recognized by the law of the country to which the foreigner belongs; or (b.) That some other ceremony, in addition to that under the Foreign Marriage „ Act, which is recognized by the law of the country to which the foreigner beloogs has taken or will take place; or (c.) That the leave of the Secretary of State has been obtained. 5. :Not all Consular officers can receive notices and solemnize marriages, but only those who hold marriage warrants. Part III.— Marriages solemnized according to Local Law. 1. The Secretary of State is advised that marriages solemnized abroad in a Christian or non-p&lt; : ^gamous country in accordance with the formalities either prescribed or recognized as valid by the law of that country, will be deemed valid in contemplation of English la\V so far as the /orm of the marriage is concerned. As regards the 'personal capacity of the parties to intermarry, the validity of such marriages will, as a general rule, depend upon the law of the country or countries in which the parties are respectively 'domiciled at the time of the marriage. Consents of, or notices to parents or other persons, when required by any such law, are considered by English law as part of the form of the marriage. 2. If a Consular officer holding a marriage warrant, or otherwise duly authorized, (18 (l)'(2),) is rusidenls at the place where it is proposed that a marriage should be solemnized according to the local law, the parties may, on payment of the proper fee, call upon that Consular officer to attend the marriage and register it, but it must be understood that such registration is intended merely for purposes of record in this country, and in nowise atiects the validity of such marriage. A Consul cannot officially attend at the solemnization of a marriage according to local law beyond the place at which he is appointed to reside. i 3. The Secretary of State cannot undertake to give any inibrmation as to the formalities to be gone through in the case of marriages according/^o local law, or (beyond that given above) as to the validity in th^ United Kingdom of such marriages. It is therefore recommended that parties should consult the nearest Diplomatic or Consular officer of the particular country concerned, and that they should further, where desirable, take legal advice on any points that may arise in regard to English or foreign law (as the case may be). 4. Persons contemplating marriage in heathen or non-Christian countries otherwise than under ' The Foreign Marriage Act, 1892,' are recommended to communicate with the Foreign Office, giving full particulars of the case. (B.) MARRIAGES SOLEMNIZED IN ENGLAND BETWEEN A BRITISH SUBJECT AND A FOREIGNER OR BETWEEN TWO FOREIGNERS. Part I. 1. Marriages in England of foreigners, or of foreigners with British subjects, are, if performed in accordance with -the requirements of English law, valid throughout His Majesty's dominions ; but it is important that it should be clearly understood that such marriages will not necessarily be valid in the countries to which the foreigners belong. unless the legal requirements of those countries are also complied with. Marriages duly solemnized in this country have, in many instances, been declared to be invalid abroad, and their wives, English by origin, and their children have consequently found themselves abandoned in a foreign country (see Part II). Steps should therefore be taken, prior to the marriage, to obtain from the Consul or from the diplomatic representative-qf the foreign State in this country satisfactory assurances that the requirements of that otate have been complied with. • 2. trench Consular officers in this country, and the Belgian Legation in London, -are now authorized, in the case of an intended marriage between a British and a French or Belgian subject, to issue a certificate or a declaration to the effect that the formalities required by the French or Belgian law have been duly carried out in France or in Belgium. In all cases, therefore, where a French citizen or a Belgian subject is concerned, it is of great importance that the parties should procure from the nearest B rendh Consul or from the Belgian Minister such certificate or declaration.3. Further points to be borne in mind where foreigners are concerned are :— (1.) That a certificate of a marriage vis^-d (or ' legalized,' as it is sometimes termed) by a Consul is of no effect towards rendering valid abroad a marriage which has been solemnized in this country but with respect to which the law of t^e foreign country has not been complied with. (2.) That a Consul's visa to a document only certifies to its authenticity as a document, or to the authenticity of some signature affixed thereto. (3.) That compliance with the law of his own country will, of course, not exempt a foreigner desiring to marry in this country from complying in every respect with the law of this country. (4.) That in countries where the Orthodox Eastern (Greek) Church is the State Church civil marriage is not recognized, and if the party to the marriage who is a subject of such country is also a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church the marii^ge to be recognized in that country must be solemnized in presence of a priest of the Orthodox Eastern Church. * • • All notices of marriage in this country between a British subject and a foreigner, or between foreigners, must be given personally to the Superintendent Registrar direct, and be attested by him. Registrars are instructed in their regulations to refer all cases of* this kind to their Superintendent. • Part 11.— Marriage of English Women with Hindus, Moslems, African Negroes, ^c. 1. The marriage of a woman of British nationality professing the Christian* faith with a Hindu or Mohammedan, even in a case when it is valid in all respects in this country, is not necessarily so when the husband returns to India, or his own Mohammedan ^country. In India he is subject to what is known as his 'personal' law if a Hindu, and this law would probably not recognize the marriage at all, and in the case of ar Mohnmmedan the fact that the marriage took place .under forms prescribed by English law only might give rise to doubts in a Mohammetlan country as to the validity of the marriage, or,at least place the parties in a position of some difficulty. The Indian Courts would in such cases be able to offer very inadequate, if any, protection to the wife of such an English marriage, while her position under a foreign Court would be presumably w T orse. • 2. In neither case is the marriage one'that necessarily implies (outside England) the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, for under his ' personal' law the Hindu, and under Mohammedan law the Mohammedan, husband may, if he desires, take other wives in addition to the first, without consulting his first wife (whether Christian or otherwise). Even if the Hindu or Mohammedan husband had entered into a covenant with his Christian wife not to take any other wife, such a covenant could not prevent him from taking another wife in India or a Mohammedan country if he so desired. The forms observed at a marriage under English law before a Registrar are not necessarily recognized by Mohammedan law' as giving any legal effect or validity to the marriage relationship, and afford no protection to the wife in a country where Mohammedan law is observed. Where a marriage relationship is constituted which the Mohammedan law will recognize, a Mohammedan husband may, under Mohammedan law, divorce his wife at will without any legal formality beyond that of repudiating her, wiiile should he return to his own country leaving his Christian wife here, the fact of their being thus locally separated might be equivalent to divorce under Mohammedan law; in either case such divorce, while not dissolving the marriage in England under English law, would be operative in the Mohammedan country. 3. In the case of a woman of British nationality professing the Christian faith who marries a Mohammedan who is not a British subject, but is a subject or citizen of a Mohammedan State, she loses her British nationality on her marriage, and when the huslmnd and wife land in any Mohammedan country (not being in the Dominions or under the Protectorate of His Britannic Majesty) they both become subject to the Mohammedan law. Further, the wife having lost her British nationality, would appear to have become disentitled to the protection or assistance of any British authority,' Consular o'r otherwise. 4. African negroes are in many cases in their own countries subject, in certain particulars, to native law and custom which may ^permit of polygamy. oX MARRIAGES ABROAD AND IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. (A.)* MARRIAGES SOLEMNIZED ABROAD. Part I. 1. MAKRIAGES abroad between persons of whom both are British subjects, or of whom one is a ffiitiah subject, oan be solemnized either— (a.) Under ' The' Foreign Marriage Act, 1892,' and 'The Foreign Marriages Order in Council, 1913,' at one of His Majesty's Consulates where the law of the country does not forbid such marriages ; or, in very special circum stances, at one of His Majesty's Embassies or Legations. (Marriages under the Foreign Marriage Act are 'prohibited in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States of America, and •Venezuela. In these countries they can only take place according to the Ipcal law) or— (6.) According to local law. - 2s If one of the parties is a subject or citizen of the country in which the (I, (i) (c) marriage is to take place, then the marriage cannot be solemnized by or before a an&lt;: ^ ( d )-)' marriage officer under the Foreign Marriage Act unless— (a.) It can be shown that sufficient facilities do not exist for the solemnization of Vie marriage according to local law ; or, (6.) The^man about to be married is a British subject and the woman a subject cr citizen of the country, 'and the marriage officer is satisfied that no objection will be taken by the authorities of the country to the solemniza tion of the marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act. Any -vrson may appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal to celebrate his or her marriage based on the absence of either of the above requirements. 3. Naturalized British subjects, when within the limits of any State of which they were previously subjects or citizens, are not considered British subjects for the purposes of the Foreign Marriage Act unless they can show that they have divested themselves of the nationality of such State. The marriage of a naturalized British subject with a person other than a natural born British subject cannot be solemnized by or before a marriage officer until the latter has obtained the sanction of the Secretary of State.

EariTIII.— Marriages solemnized according to Local Law. 1. The Secretary of State is advised that marriages solemnized abroad in a Christian or non-polygamous country in accordance with the formalities either prescribed or recognized as valid by the law of that country, will be deemed valid in contemplation of English law so far as the form of the marriage is concerned. As regards the 'personal capacity of the parties to intermarry, the validity of such marriages will, as a general rule, depend upon the law of the country or countries in which the parties are respectively domiciled at the time of the marriage. Consents of, or notices to parents or other persons, when required by any such law, are considered by English law as part of the form of the marriage. 2. If a Consular officer holding a ijiarriage warrant, or otherwise duly authorized, (18 (l) (2).) is resident at the place where it is proposed that a marriage should be solemnized according to the local law, the parties may, on payment of the proper fee, call upon that Consular officer to attend the marriage and register it, but it must be understood that such registration is intended merely for purposes of record in this country, and in nowise affects the validity of such marriage. A Consul cannot officially attend at the solemnization of a marriage according to local law beyond the place at which he is appointed to reside. - • . - . 3.

Marriages in England of foreigners, or of foreigners with British subjects, are, if performed in accordance with the requirements of English law, valid throughout His Majesty's dominions ; but it is important that it should be clearly understood that such marriages will not necessarily be valid in the countries to which the foreigners belong, unless the legal requirements of those countries are also complied with. Marriages duly solemnized in this country have, in many instances, been declared to be invalid abroad, and their wives, English by origin, and their children have consequently found themselves abandoned in a foreign country (see Part II). Steps should therefore be taken, prior to the marriage, to obtain from the Consul or from the diplomatic representative of the foreign State in this country satisfactory assurances that the requirements of that State have been'compliecLwith. 2. French Consular officers in this country, and the Belgian Legation in London, are now authorized, in the case of an intended marriage between a British and a French or Belgian subject, to issue a certificate or a declaration to the effect that the formalities required by the, French or Belgian law have been duly carried out in France or in Belgium. In all cases, therefore, where a French citizen or a Belgian subject is concerned, it is of great importance that the parties should procure from the nearest French Consul or from the Belgian Minister such certificate or declaration. (B.) MARRIAGES SOLEMNIZED IN ENGLAND BETWEEN A BRITISH SUBJECT AND A FOREIGNER OR BETWEEN TWO FOREIGNERS. lyr 4 3. Further points to be borne in mind where foreigners are concerned are :— (1.) That a certificate of a marriage vis^-d (or ' fegalized,' as 'it is sometimes termed) by a Consul is of no effect towards rendering valid abroad a marriage which has been solemnized in this country but with respect to which the law of the foreign country has not been complied with. (2.) That a Consul's visa to a document only certifies to its authenticity as a document, or to the authenticity of some signature affixed thereto. (3.) That compliance with the law of his own country •will, of course, not exempt a foreigner desiring to marry in this country from complying in every respect -.with the law of this country. (4.) That in countries where the Orthodox Eastern (Greek). Church is the State Church civil marriage is not recognized, and if the party to the marriage who is a'subject of such country is also a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church the marriage to be recognized in that country must be solemnized in presence of a priest of the Orthodox Eastern Church. All notices of marriage in this country between a British subject and a foreigner, or between foreigners, must be given personally to the Superintendent Registrar direct, and be attested by him. Registrars are instructed in their regulations to r^fer all cases of this kind to their Superintendent. Part II.— Marriage of English Women with Hindus, Moslems, African Negroes? &amp;c. 1. The marriage of a woman of British nationality professing the Christian faith with a Hindu or Mohammedan, even in a case when it is valid in all- respects in this country, is not necessarily so when the husband returns to India or his own Mohammedan country. In India he is subject to what is known as his ' personal ' law if a Hindu, and this law would probably noj: recognize the marriage at all, and in the' case of a Mohammedan the fact that the marriage took place uiider forms prescribed by English law only might give rise to doubts in a Mohammedan country as to the validity of the marriage, or^t least place the parties in a position of some difficulty. The Indian Courts would in such cases be able to offer very inadequate, if any, protection to the wife of such an English marriage, while her position under a foreign Court would be presumably worse. 2. In neither case is the marriage one that necessarily implies (outside England) the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, for under his ' personal ' law the Hindu, and under Mohammedan law the Mohammedan, husband may, if he desires, take other wives in addition to the first, without consulting his first wife (whether Christian or otherwise). Even if the Hindu or Mohammedan husband had entered into a covenant with his Christian wife not to take any other wife, such a covenant could not prevent him from taking another wife in India or a Mohammedan country if he so desired. The forms observed at a marriage under English law before a Registrar are not necessarily recognized by Mohammedan law as giving any legal effect or validity to the marriage relationship, and afford no protection to the wife in a country where Mohammedan law is observed. Where a marriage relationship is constituted which the Mohammedan law will recognize, a Mohammedan husband may, under Mohammedan law, divorce his wife at will without any legal formality beyond that of repudiating her, while should he return to his own country leaving his Christian wife here, the fact of their being thus locally separated might be equivalent to divorce under Mohammedan law ; in either case such divorce, while not dissolving the marriage in England under English law, wo'uld be operative in the Mohammedan country. 3. In the case of a woman of British nationality professing the Christian faith who marries a Mohammedan who is not a British subject, but is a subject or citizen of a Mohammedan State, she loses her British nationality on her marriage, and when the husband and wife land in any Mohammedan country (not being in the Dominions or under the Protectorate of His Britannic Majesty) they both become subject to the Mohammedan law. Further, the wife having lost her British nationality, would appear to have become disentitled to the protection or assistance of any British authority. Consular or otherwise. 4.

In this connection please see correspondence ending with foreign and Political Department letter No. 1585-CJ. dated &lt;i0th July 1911 in course of which same question has been previously raised. As far as I can see giving of Notarial Powers to Political Agent does not affect matter one way or the other as it does not give him power to register marriages, and even ir he were a marriage officer he would only have power to register marriages of British subjects. J. take it however that he could register a copy of the Marriage lines' in the Agency Just as any other document could be registered on payment or the proper fee if that would satisfy the parties?
