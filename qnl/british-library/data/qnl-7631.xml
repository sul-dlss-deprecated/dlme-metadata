Arms traffic. Appointment of Italian Agent Alasqat. The French Question. In March the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf put forward a pro- V +1 f ioinnrl SViwTikh should be rented from the Shaikh for the purpose of forming on it a quarantine station. He further proposed thatthk Tatfon should, in view of the importance of Brit,sh interests, be taken entpely under British control and be maintained at British cost. Towards the end of the summer various incidents took place in which the quarantine rules were disregarded by Kuwait subjects. The Shaikh purposely Efted a disinclination to interfere or to help the Political Agen with a view to obtaining British support m connection with the hao case, me Political Agent suggested that a guard should be placed on board the B. I. boats in order to enforce the observance of the quarantine rules, and it w s even suggested that the British India steamers should^ discontinue their visits to Kuwaitpending a satisfactory settlement of the question. Throughout the vear there have been continual reports showing that 'Kuwait has been the depot for arms taken across to the neighbouring Persian coasts. MASQAT. an In December 1907, the Secretary of State for India telegraphed that the at Italian Government proposed to send an Agent to Masqat to organise a service of information regarding the contraband trade in arms between that place and Somaliland. Ihe Political Agent^ at Masqat was accordingly instructed to afford him any facilities he might require, and the Govern ment of India offered no objection to the proposal. Early jn January, how ever, it was stated that it was the intention of the Italian Government to found a Consular Agency at Masqat, and it was announced that a Captain Crispi had been actually appointed. The Indian Government suggested that the matter should be at least postponed until the close of the Brus sels Arms Conference, and that it was most desirable that the Italian Government should he induced to substitute a native news-agent for a Consular Officer. As a result of representations made by the British Government, the Italian Government intimated in August that they consented to postpone any definite decision regarding the appointment until the result of tiie Arms Conference, in so far as Masqat is concerned, should be made known. In October, owing to the remoteness of a settlement with regard to the Masqat arms traffic, the question was once more raised by the Italian Government, who represented the necessity of sending their new Consular Agent to take up his post without delay. The Indian Government again ex pressed itself as being opposed to the appointment, and suggested that an agreement might be arrived at with the Italian Government, whereby the British Agent could undertake to pay special attention to the trade from Masqat to Italian Somaliland, and to use every endeavour to put a stop to it. He would be in a position to telegraph all the information that could be collected regarding the arms traffic to Aden for transmission to the Italian authorities in Somaliland. On the 28th November, the Secretary cf State telegraphed that the Italian Government .would send to Masqat a native agent in place of an Italian Consular Agent. On the 2nd of December, the British Political Agent, Masqat, protested even against this on the grounds that:— a) recent action in the case of Somali dhows should have a deterrent effect in the future ; (2) unless supported by vessels of war, an Italian Agent at Masqat could not lake the necessary steps to stop the trade ; (3) the appointment would give the Sultan an enhanced idea of his own importance, and thereby render him more difficult to deal with. The Government stated that in view of the communications which had taken place between them and the Italian Government they did not see their way to offering any further objection. Ilft , In April the French Government officially announced their approval to the text of the Proclamation giving effect to the Masqat Arbitration Case.Subsequently, with the approval of the French Government, it was decided that the document should be translated into Arabic and presented to the Sultan of Masqat. Maior Grey left for Europe on the 1st April to attend the Brussels Arms Conference, handing over charge to Captain Scott, IM S., until the arrival of Captain McConaghey who was appointed to succeed Major Grey. In November Mr. R. E. Holland, from the Foreign Department, was appointed Consul, vice Captain McConaghey, and assumed charge of his duties on the 9 th. ABU MUSA. Towards the end of December 1907, the German Ambassador handed a note to the British Government containing the views of the German Govern ment on the subject of the case. Early in January the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the Shaikh of Sharjah could not be induced to take measures for the pro per maintenance of the guard that had been placed on the island, and pro posed that the third partner, Esa bin Abdul Latif, should live on the Island and take charge of the necessary guard, funds being supplied for the purpose by the British Government. It was further reported that there was a rumour current that a German steamer was to proceed to Abu Musa and, in spite of the Shaikh’s opposition, to remove the oxide. Mr. Brown, Wonkhaus agent, was thereupon informed that all the accumulated oxide might be removed, and arrangements were made that a gunboat should be present at the island during the removal of the oxide. On the 6 th January Mr. Marling reported that the German^ Charge d’Allaires at Tehran was trying to obtain a declaration from the Persian Gov ernment as to whether the island of Abu Musa was the property of Persia or not. A week later the German Consul at Bushire informed the British Poli tical Resident that he had no idea that the Shaikh of Sharjah was under British protection, and that no attempt w ould be made to remove any oxide from the island of Abu Musa without due permission. About, the middle of February the German Consul at Bushire intimated that Wonkhaus wished to send a ship to the island in March to remove^the accu mulated oxide. This was agreed to, and the German steamer “Louise arrived at Abu Musi on the 10th April for the purpose. At the same time the .nova Indian Marine Ship “ Lawrence” was sent to the island, there being no s ip of the Navy available for the duty of watching the proceedings Ike opera tion of loading the steamer was carried out without incident, ab0llt 1,810 tons being shipped, whilst another 100 w r ere left on the beach. In Julv the British Government handed to the German Ambassador an answer to the German note of the 31st December, explaining the situation fully from a British point of view. Duvin- the autumn it was decided that temporary arrangements should be made for carrying on mining operations pending the settlement cf the ease with Germany. As it was considered that the agreement was to be of such a temporary nature, the Political Agent in the Persian Gulf was instructed to approach Messrs. Strick’s local agent with a Tiew to inducing that firm to undertake the work. However that officer intimated that he considered the brother of the British Agent at Lingeh to he the most suitable Concessionaire available. Finally, on 20th October, the Political Agent reported that the Concessionaire Hasan would at the end of Ramzan re-oommenee the removal of the accumulated oxide as Germany may require. 1 his operation he said would take at least three months, and on its completion Hasan s connection with the island w ould terminate. A decision is required whether the brother of the Residency Agent at Lingeh is to commence the mining of a fresh supply of oxi e on e i* me of Abu Musa under a contract with the Shaikh of 5 &gt;harj;ih, orw e icr ? 18 0 enter on private arrangements with the Residency, under wmich he wi I be guaranteed from loss.104 NAJD. 1907, and Abdul Aziz bin Sana retired to xticiuu, C : returned to Hail, with the intention of undertaking a further expedition against bin Saud in the spring. In February tbe inhabitants of Qasira invited bin Rashid to march with them against bin Saud, but he, instead of responding readily to the invitation, put it off till March, and subsequently to April, until finally they lost all con fidence in him, and announced that if he did not come at once they would abandon bis cause. Upon this threat he opened negotiations with bin baud, who was already marching against Qasirn, treating for peace by abandoning to him Qasim and its surrounding tribes, and reserving for himseu Jabal Shammar and its dependencies. Bin Saud thereupon accepted his oiler and reduced Qasim to submission. This mode of procedure did not at all suit the warlike followers of bin Rashid, who forced him eventually to abdicate in favour of his brother Saud bin Llamud-ar-Rashid. Bin Rashid then attempted to withdraw to Teima, but was brought back in chains to Hail. As soon as be came to power, Saud bin Rashid w'rote to bin Saud announc ing the allocation of his brother and his succession to the Emirlik of Hail, and declared his readiness to abide by tbe arrangements adopted by his predecessor. Bin Saud immediately ordered the release of bin Rashid and his despatch to Qasim. Saud bin Rashid, fearing that his brother might be returned to power through the assistance of bin Saud, bad him slain in prison together w’ith his young son. This probably took place about the end of June. Some time in September, probably, the Sabhan division of the Shammar tribe, under the leadership of Hamud-bin-Sabhan, organised a strong raid against bin Rashid, and attacked him at Hail. The latter was found to be so weak through desertion amongst bis followers that he had no power to resist the attack. The raiders entered the town and slew him together with his brother Faisal. The latest reports tend to show that Hail and the Shammar tribe are under the leadership of Hamud-bin-Sabban, who is the uncle of Saud-bin-Abdul Aziz-bin-Rasbid, the young boy now at Madinah. The latter is now ten years old, and has been invited to return from Madinah and take up the Emirlik of Somaliland, and, with the exception of a number of raids and counter-raids betw r een various tribes, there was no disturbance of any importance. Later reports, however, tend to show that matters have taken a decided change for the worse. his followers, who were continually attempting to intrigue with our tribes. He was probably afraid of losing his influence with the tribes if he came to be regarded as a peace prophet. During the course of the year it was reported that the Mulla w^as very short of ammunition; and, as his chief supplies had to come through the Warsangli, it was most necessary for him to win over that tribe as far as possible. In this attempt he had marked success. In January numbers of Warsangli were reported to be joining the Mulla, and in the same month two large convoys were escorted to him by this tribe, for which they received rewards. In May the Warsangli looted the Said Tunis Barkat, driving oft' a large amount of stock. The general opinion was that this raid was due to an alliance between the Mulla and the Warsangli. At the beginning of June a force of from 400—500 Dervishes arrived at Halin, about 25 miles inside the boundary, and proceeded to build a fort there. This force was furnished with supplies by the Warsangli. It was thought at the Hail. General. SOMALILAND. During the first few months of the year affairs were remarkably quiet in Briush Somaliland. At the commencement of tbe year, the disturbing factor in Somaliland, the Mulla, showed no desire to break tbe peace ; but it was apparent that be was inclined to listen with a certain-amount of favour to the more fanatical among105 0 $ 6 (! bift tatioi .1 Ctlli. wo| Saul, lonii» Jatal r aai ftia Sani eima, mnc- k of liis f hu be son le, ar id so tk kt ate bdul fears ikoi liet in r-raids Late! jkangf nd, tin he wa. 1 amor! is, 5 e tok 'eportf; lies^ rinot* JSS, I 1 aai® dl^ rli t 1 time that this move was due to the successes of Yusuf Ali against the Mulla, and that the latter was being driven north. However, subsequent events would seem to show the cause as originating in hostile designs against the British Government. In the same month the Warsangli made three raids on the tribes in British territory, and refused te enter into negotiations with the ergos (friendly deputations) of Government, whilst writing at the same time to the Mulla for permission to retain the looted stock. In the end of August it was reported that there were no Dervishes nearer than Las Bohal Warabur. The Mulla had arrested several Muhammad Gerad tribesmen who had gone to the Harun, owing to their tribe not having openly espoused his cause in the same way as the Warsangli. Towards the end of the year the Mulla commenced to show activity within the British Protectorate by attacking friendly tribes, and looting large numbers of camels. The outlook became so disquieting that 300 King’s African Rifles were despatched from Mombasa to Berbera to re-inforce the troops in Somali- land, and further re-inforcements haye since been sent. During the year there have been constant raids between the Mulla’s people Italian Somaliland, and the Mijjertein and the Ogaden. Subsequently, however, Yusuf Ali, of the Mij^ertein, had some measure of success against the Mulla, and although the Miiila has made every endeavour to overcome him, he has not been successful up to date. In June the Mulla despatched a force of 1,000 of his riflemen against Yusuf Ali with orders to remain away six months and to exterminate the Mijjertein, looting only being a secondary consideration. It was reported in July that these raiding parties had proved unsuccessful, except in one instance, and had returned to the Harun. The reason for this lack of success was that the Mijjertein apparently hearing of the despatch of the force, retired south. The Dervishes having realised that the Mijjertein were beyond their reach attacked the Marehan and Hawiya, killing many people and carrying off much stock. During the year the Italians have experienced much trouble with the tribes in their hinterland. In February the Bimal tribe attacked an exploring party of the garrison stationed at Merca. There have also been many attacks made by Abyssinian tribes, which, if not actually instigated by Menelik, have certainly been connived at by him. In March the Italians inflicted a severe defeat on the Bimal rebels, but subsequent reports point to their having suffered a reverse with a loss of several officers. In November it was reported that Italian troops had repulsed 2,000 rebels at Bullalo,* inflicting considerable loss. Towards the close of 1907 rumours of the defeat of two forces of Ahys- Iai fk 8sinian Somah ' sinians by the Somalis were received, but early in the present year these rumours proved to he false. The Abyssinians gained several successes over the Bagheri, hut it was reported that the main body of the tribe remained untouched. Much stock was, however, recovered and Fitaurari Abanbaro returned in Januaiy. No settlement has yet been attained by the French authorities with regard FrenchSomallland to the murder of two Frenchmen last year. The guilty parties have not yet been arrested, and the tribe, the Aysa, from which the murderers came, desire to settle the matter by the payment of blood money. The French refuse to accept this method of adjustment. Towards the end of 1907 the authorities at Jibuti stopped the importation Arm8Trartlc - and sale of arms by Indian merchants, and no future consignments will he permitted. This is a step in the right direction, hut until the French and Greek firms are dealt with in the same fashion little benefit will be derived from the present prohibition. Reports show that there has been a large trade from Masqat to the Somali coast. Steps have been taken by the Political Agent at Masqat to combat this trade by personally taking the papers of Somali dhows found on the Batineh coast, so as to necessitate their calling at Masqat on their way back, when an examination for arms would be possible. On the Somali coast itself British * (Ballad).ships of war have been constantly on the watch for dhows carrying arms, but up to the present there have only been a few small captures. Eeports from a traveller in Abyssinia assert that a tremendous trade iu arms is carried on through the agency of the French Consul at Dirre Dawa. Erom Abyssinia the rifles pass through the hands of the Ogaden to the Mulla. Tbe writer states that he has met caravans containing as many as lo 3 00. ritles nn fli a mnrnh in Ahvssinia. Acquirement of a Early in September it was reported from Aden that the German gun-boat non 1 ™!!! ^he^neShl “ Seeadler ” visited Jibuti and remained there three days. The Governor of bourbood of Jibuti. Jibuti accompanied some of the officers of the gunboat, and measured a plot of land five miles west of Jibuti to be acquired for the purpose of a coal depot. Inquiries were made at Paris unofficially as to whether there w T as any founda tion for the report of a concession to the German Government of a coaling depot near Jibuti; it was stated that there was absolutely no foundation for such a rumour. ABYSSINIA. General. There would appear to be nothing of importance to record in Abyssinia during the year under review. The fact which was mentioned in last year’s reports that the Negus Menelik had formed a Cabinet on Puiopeau lines has been substantiated. It is reported that considerable interest is manifested in Abyssinia in the movement, as it is recognised that if the new Ministers are enabled to perform tbeir functions they will be able to relieve the Emperor of many matters of detail, which at present occupy his time to the exclusion of other more important matters. Nomination of an In Jnne it was reported that the Emperor had nominated as his suc- heir to the tbrone. cessor Lidj Eyassu, a son of Pas Mikhael and the Emperor s daughter. Projected visit of In May Amir Abdullah Sadik, the Governor of Harar, who was deported the Governor 0 f Ha-f rom j n 1906 , expressed an intention of visiting the Somali Mulla ma Muiia. S ° al Aden and Berbera. The object of the visit was said to be to lorm an offensive and defensive alliance between the Mulla and Menelik against ourselves and the Italians. Later, however, it was reported that Abdulla Sadik had been stopped by order of the Emperor Menelik, and that he had returned to Harar. itaio-Abyssinian At the commencement of the year a boundary Convention was at last boundary Conven- signed between the Italian Government and Menelik, by which a large piece tion * of territory is ceded to Italy. By it she obtains the whole of the left bank of the Juba up to the point where the Danu and Ganale join to form that river, at the town of Hole. Erom Hole the new frontier is drawn eastwards till it reaches the Webi Shebili, and from that point it is to follow the Nerizzini line, i.£?„ 180 miles from the coast, until the frontier of British Somaliland is reached. By this treaty Italy gains Hugh, of which she has long been desirous of obtaining possession. The amount of compensation which Italy will pay to Menelik for the recognition of her sovereignty has not yet been settled. Angio-Abyssmian In the beginning of the year the long delayed question regarding the Froctier. frontier between British East Africa and Abyssinia was settled. The frontier as now defined follows the fourth parallel of north latitude, and, while leaving Lake Stephanie to Abyssinia, meets Lake Rudolph at a point about Lat. 10° 30' N on its eastern shore. The boundary is now being demarcated. Jibuti-Dirre Daws The Emperor appears to have refused the extension of the Jibuti-Hirre Railway Exteueion. Hawa railway, and its transfer to the Erench Government. In December, however, it was reported in the Press that a party of French engineers had lately surveyed the section from Hirre Hawa to Addis Abbaba, and that operations upon it were expected to commence shortly.AFGHANISTAN. External. At no time since 1S97 have events on (he frontier and in Afghanistan assumed a graver form than in the year under review. In fact a rupture in the peaceful relations between the Afghan and British governments has seemed to be imminent on more than one occasion. At the end of lb07 no external signs of any immediate danger of friction were manifest, although conjectures were rife that the signature and publication of the Anglo-Bussian Convention before the consent of Afghanis tan had been obtained had offended the susceptibilities of certain implacable elements among the Afghan authorities. The 1907 tour of the Amir in India, followed by a prolonged tour in his own dominions, had apparently not tended to consolidate his authority and it was rumoured that Sardar Nasarulla Khan had availed himself of his brother’s absence to encourage a dangerous recru descence of Anglophobe proclivities among the mull&amp;s and other officials in the vicinity of Kabul. The evolution of the new policy, by which every encour agement is given to all Afghan subjects to possess themselves of arms and ammunition, steadily progressed. Among an ignorant and fanatical population swayed by every word of their bigoted priests, this reckless dissemination of modem weapons cannot fail to furnish a standing menace to the stability of Sympathy peace. Signs of this were not wanting when the British Government was Zakka Khe1, compelled early in February to despatch an expeditionary force against the Zakka Khel in the Bazar valley. No sooner had the news of the advance of Government troops spread into Ningrahar, than the excitement among the inhabitants rose to fever heat. Urged on by the mullas, a formidable lashkar hastened to the assistance of their co-religionists in Bazar. Active co-operation was only averted by the rapidity with which the expeditionary force had oc cupied and retired from the Bazar valley. lashkar arrived on the scene only to find that the Afridis had already sued for peace and were unwilling to reopen hostilities, which had proved so disastrous to their interests. Before the expedition started on the 13th February His Excellency the Viceroy had sent to the Amir a despatch, informing him of its necessity and requesting him to exert his influence in restraining his subjects ^ from active participation in the hostilities. This despatch reached the Amir as he was travelling from Kabul to Jalalabad, where he arrived on the 2 ith February. Owing to the impossibility of sending off the despatch before the Afridi^ maliks had been formally interviewed at Peshawar on the 12th February, it is only just to notice that full opportunities could not be given to the Amir to restrain his subjects. In any case there is little doubt that the Afghan officials both gave asylum to the Zakka Khel, and also encouraged Afghan subjects to go to their assistance. The Amir, however, summoned the British Agent at Kabul to Jalalabad on the 2nd March and explained his difficulty in preventing his people from joining in what they considered to be a jehad, but gave details of such steps as he had been able to take. Shortly after this, however, while the Amir was still at Jalalabad, it be- Revival of came clear that a deliberate attempt was being made to revive the Tor Kham Kimu question, boundary incident. It will be remembered that the Indo-Afghan boundary between Nawa Kotal and the Safed Koh has never been actually demarcated. The point where the Landi Kotal—Dakka road actually crosses the boundary has been a matter of dispute for many years. The late Amir Abdur Bahman claimed that the boundary passed through .Landi Khana. There is little doubt that the claim was due to a desire to obtain control over the water which takes its rise among the Loargai Shinwari villages of Bagh and Kbargali. Although the rights of this demand have always been repudiated, yet the Afghan kofila guards have h en permitted, as a matter of courtesy, to corns as far as Landi Khana in order to obtain drinking water, while our escortts have gone as far as Tor Kham ever since the last Afghan war. During the hot weather there is no water available between Haft Chah and Landi Khana. Towards the middle of March the Political Agent in the Khaibar reportedAfgtmn Assistance to Mohmands.

The presence of the Amir at Jalalabad, where reports of all incidents on the fron- must speedily have reached him, added to the gravity of the situation. On the 21st of March the Sarhang of Dakka, accompanied by a force nf ^ khTsadar, arrived in person to take over the caravan. He refused to o-rant the Native’Officer in command of the Khaibar Rifles escort a receipt unless Landi Khana were entered as the handing-over place. While the matter was being discussed the khasadars aided the kudus m pushing their animals past the'Khaibar Rifles.' The caravan was sent on towards Dakka under an escort of 150 khasadars, but the Sarhang himself stayed at Land. Khana until the arrival of a British officer of the Khaibar Rifles. The Sarhang stated that he had received strict orders to take over at Lamli Khana. After some conversation the usual receipt was signed and the incident closed for the day. The Amir left Jalalabad for Kabul on the 24th March. Burin 0, April friction between the Afghans and Khaibar Rifles continued to ..u-rease On the 9th the Chief Commissioner reported that the Afghan khasadars now came as far as Lakhtai, the water supply a quarter of a mi o east of, and above, Landi Khana. _ On the 8th April the Amir wrote a letter to the Viceroy, from which it was evident that the demands of the Afghans were increasino-daily. He complained that the Khaibar Rifles transgressed his boundary 0 by coming to Tor Kham and requested that the head of the water at Landi Khana be recognised as the place for the handing and taking over of caravans. . jl On April 14th the Khaibar Rifles escort accompanying a consignment of the Amir’s ammunition was again met by the Sarhang of Dakka at Lakhtaj The Subedar in charge was informed that if he advanced further fire would be opened on his party In answer to all remonstrances the Sarhang insisted that he was acting on direct orders from the Amir. As instructions had been received that an actual collision was to he avoided at all costs, the Suhedar gave way, made over the convoy at Lakhtai and repoited the matter on his return ‘There seems no doubt that the Afghans, who were holding the high ground as far as Tor Kham, intended to open fire if the Khaibar Kifles advanced. During April the concentration of British troops on the Mohmand border 'became necessaiy owing to the threatening altitude of the tribesmen. It became evident to the Afghans that the British Government was projecting active reprisals against the offenders. On this occasion secrecy had been im possible, as the Mohmands had adopted offensive tactics which necessitated the immediate reinforcement of the posts along the frontier. On the 23rd April an official letter was sent to the Amir. It was pointed out that Afghan subjects and officials had taken an active part in all the troubles on the frontier. The Amir was accordingly requested to prevent his subjects from assisting the tribes.On the 24th April a gathering of the Mohmand tribes was attacked in a position well inside the border of the Peshawar district to the north-west of Matta and severely routed. A few days later the news was received that an Afghan lashkar, Attack by estimated at from 13,000 to 20,000 strong under Sufi Sahib, a notorious Afghan mulla and firebrand, was advancing towards the Khaibar. This lashkar camped east of Landi Khana on May 1st and divided into two parts. The Sufi Sahib with one portion crossed over into Bazar with the intention of subsequent ly visiting Bara, his object being to enlist the sympathies of the Afridis in the jehad which he was preaching. In this it is quite possible that he would have succeeded, had his plans not been wrecked by the undue precipitancy of the other half of his lashkar, which by a premature attack on Michni Kandao and Landi Kotal brought about a dispersal of the w^hole force. On the 8th May the Viceroy received a reply to his letter on the subject of the Mohmand disturbances. It was dated the 5th May. The tone was apologetic and friendly, but the Amir disavowed all knowledge of the actions of his subjects. He laid the blame on the Indian Government, who had failed to inform him of the contemplated expedition as had been done in the case of the expedition against the Zakka Khel. The Amir claimed that in the^ case of the Zakka Khel he had succeeded in preventing his subjects from joining in the hostilities. This claim of course ignored the facts that the first despatch can only have reached him some days after the commencement of the expe dition ; that a lashkar of his subjects actually did assemble and endeavour to join in the expedition and were only stopped by the Zakka Khel who did not desire to continue hostilities ; and that the troops assembled for the Mohmand expedition had so far been only engaged in repelling attacks by Afghan subjects as well as by Mohmand tribesmen. The Amir ended his letter by stating that notwithstanding all the difficulties he had given stringent orders that as far as possible Afe-han subjects should be prevented from joining the Mohmands. Hut at this very time a large portion of the population of Eastern Afghanistan was taking up arms with a view to participating in a holy war against the British, and in this they were being almost openly encouraged by the highest Afghan officials.* The leading mullas were about this time summoned to” Kabul, but it is quite certain that they received only nominal punishment and were subsequently rewarded and treated with greater favour than before. Still the mere fact of 'their being recalled served to discourage the tribesmen and proved of assistance to the British Government. On the other hand information w'as obtained from reliable sources that 5,000 rifles were issued from the arsenal to ghazis during April. In the meantime all traffic through the Khaibar had been suspended, and in a letter dated the 17th May Colonel Boos Keppel, under instructions from the Government of India, informed the Sarhang of Dakka that Government maintained Tor Kham to be the place for exchanging escorts of kafilas in accordance with long practice pending any delimitation of the frontier, and that a communication to this effect was being addressed to tlie Amir u nless the Sarhang agreed to the continuance of the old practice in the mean time, kafilas would not be allowed to pass. No answer being received the Khaibar remained closed to caravans. _ ( Next came the Mohmand expedition, where notwithstanding the Amir's prohibitions large numbers of Afghan subjects, and even some of the Afghan regular army, were reported to be fighting on the side of the Mohmands. It had now become evident, however, that the Afghan Government had relinqu ished the idea of openly assisting the tribes in &amp; jehad against the British Government The excitement died down when it was discovered that the Mohmands were left unaided to bear the brunt of the attack ot the British forces. Diecont Icafllas Khaibar. Throughout May no kafilas were allowed to proceed through the Khaibar. Large numbers of traders were detained at Peshawar and subjected to great inconvenience and risk. This action soon produced the desired eflect, or on the 25th May the Political Agent, Khaibar, received an answer trom tne Sarhang of Hakka. The reply was more polite than the preceding letters and * It has since been reported by the British Agent at Kabul that the Amir during his ™ Puvney from Jalala bad to Kabul in April 1909, gave gold medals to all the prominent men who had taken a leading pait in * movement.Ee-opening of Khaibar, Kbaibar agai closed. it was agreed that the old procedure should he followed, v? 2 _, your escort should bring the fa/Zias coining from Peshawar side to lor Kham and our escorts should take the fcafilas coming from Afghanistan up to the head of the Landi Khana water’*. It was then thought that the incident was satisfactorily closed and the pass was opened to caravans early in June. On the 4th J une half the Jcafila left Landi Kotal. At Lakhtai the escort met a few Uasadars who accompanied the Khaibar Kifles escort to Tor Kham where they were met by the Sarhang of Dakka 'with a small escort. The Sarhang asked the Khaibar Rifles Native Officer in charge why he had advanced as tar as Tor Kham, and informed him that until the written permission of the Amir was produced this could not be allowed. On the morning of the 5th the remain. in&lt;* half kafila was escorted to Tor Kham, being met as before at Lakhtai by a few khasadars The Sarhang did not come in person hut sent a sadbashi with a small escort of 10 or 12 knasadars. The Sadbashi again repeated the words used by the Sarhang the day before and added in a private conversation with the Native Officer of the escort the request that until the boundary was exactly fixed by the Amir we should avoid friction by not going to Tor Kham, n On the 6th June the Political Agent Khaibar wTote to the Sarhang of Dakka, 1 that kafilas would again he discontinued until the misunderstanding was cleared up. On the loth June a letter was received from the Sarhang of Dakka, in which he complained about the detention of 10 donkey loads of rifle bayonets. In reply attention was invited to the letter of the 6th June and he was informed that all knfilets were stopped until the matter had been more clearly defined, and that a further communica tion had been addressed to the Amir on the subject. There is little doubt that the stoppage of caravans caused grave inconvenience to the Afghan authorities, as is evinced by the fact that on this occasion replies were received with a certain amount of promptitude in contradistinction to the usual custom of ex hibiting great delay or even total neglect in replying to all unpalatable docu ments. At the beginning of July a long reply was received from the Amir in which it was stated that stringent orders had been given to the Sarhang of Dakka to allow the Khaibar Rifles escorts to proceed as far as Tor Kham. cicie of incident. The Political Agent Khaibar then sent a letter dated 14th July to the Sarhang of Dakka, asking if he w ere prepared to exchange escorts at Tor Kham. No reply was received until the 25th July, when the Sarhang agreed to the continuance of the old custom. The delay in sending the reply clearly pointed to the fact that the Sarhang had communicated with some authorities at Kabul as to the reply he should give. There is little doubt that this Tor Kham incident had been revived expressly on the injunctions of the authorities at Kabul. Accordingly towards the end of July the caravans were again allowed to proceed. This closed the incident. Flight of Jamshedi* Towards the end of July a telegram was received by the Secretary of State to Rusiianterritory. f 0 r India from the Russian Government, in which it w r as affirmed that 10,000 Jamshedis, fleeing from Afghan persecution, had crossed,from Afghan into Russian territory to the north of Herat. The true state of the case appeared to he as follows:—In June one Saiyid Ahmad Beg, Jamshedi, having committed some offence, was sent under escort from Herat to Kabul for trial; he was, how’ever, released in Kabul by order of Sardar Nasarulla Khan and started hack for Herat. The Governor of Herat then attempted to arrest him for a second time, whereupon he fled into Russian territory and arrived at Kushk post, accompanied by 10 followers only, about the middle of July. He ap pears to have been most hospitably received by the Russian* officials at Kushk. Saiyid Ahmad Beg re-entered Afghanistan and persuaded some 600 families of Jamshedis to migrate to Russian territory. In addition to persuading as many of his tribe as he could to migrate to Russian territory, he also used Russian territory as a base from which to commit raids on Afghan terri tory. The Viceroy telegraphed via Landi Kotal on the 26th July to the Amir ask ing to be informed of the true facts of the case, and enquiring what the Amir’s wishes in the mat ter w T ere. No answer was received, and a reminder was, by orderof the Secretary of State, sent to the Amir on the 21st August ashing him further whether he would be willing to send an emissary to negotiate with the Jamshedis. It w as pointed out about the same time by the Viceroy to the Secretary of State that the Amir would unquestionably regard the sending of an emissary as nego tiation, not with the Jamshedis, hut with the ^Russians. The Russians first estimated the number of tents at 2,500, but subsequently gave 1,500 as the correct amount. It was also stated that the Jamshedis were costing the Russian authorities one thousand roubles a day and that later on the Russian Government would make a claim on this account. A letter dated 31st August 1908 was received from the Amir in answer to the remiuder. In this letter the true facts about the refugees were represented as follows :—Formerly Mahdi Kuli Khan, alias Khan Agha, Jamshedj, resided on the frontier of Herat at Kushk. He seized every opportunity to create trouble, and was in consequence executed by the authorities of Herat. His descendants were now giving trouble. At the time of the Panjdeh tight they were summoned to Kabul because it was found that they had been acting in favour of the Russians, and against Afghan interests. They were kept there under surveillance, but fled from Kabul with Saiyid Muhammad and Saiyid Ahmad Beg, and travelling via the Herat frontier, Kushk and Chaman-i-Beg entered Russian territory. A few days later they entered Afghan territory with 70 or 80 sowars at a place where most Jamshedis who were previously friendly with the descendants of the said Khan Agha were settled, and having taken with them as many of the said families as they could win over to their side during the time, migrated across the frontier after killing 3 Afghan sub jects and 'wounding a sepoy. The Amir attributed all this to the Russians, who for a long time have been stirring up these people. The Amir suggested that all the Jamshedis should be allowed to return to their homes, with the exception of the leaders whom the Russians should settle down at some distance from the frontier or they] would certainly give more trouble. On the 17th September the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg was instructed to communicate the substance of the Amir’s explanation to the Russian Government, and ask them to accept a settlement on the lines iridieated. This arrangement was accepted by the Russians, who asked for a list of leaders whom the Afghan Government would not permit to reiurn. The Government of India accordingly sent a letter to the Amir on the 28th September asking for a list of people prescribed. In the meantime it was reported during September that most of the refugees had returned to Afgha nistan. In a letter dated 9th November the Amir communicated the following names of Jamshedis, whose return to Afghanistan could not be permitted Saiyid Ahmad Beg, Saiyid Muhammad, Abdur Rahman, Ahmad All, Khan Agha and Hafiz-ulla. On the 18th November the Russians reported that Jamshedis. returning to Afghanistan were being badly treated, and stated that it was impossible for more Jamshedis to return without some further guarantees than the assurances of the Amir. From inquiries instituted it was proved that the reports received by the Russians were greatly exaggerated. As pointed out, the previous year had closedwithout any reply bfdng received from the Amir in answer to tho Viceroys letter dated lOth September 1907 on the subject of the Anglo-Russian Convention The Amir had merely sent an acknowledgment, dated 29th September 1907 in which he regretted that he was unable to send a reply at the time as he was on tour On his return from Kabul and when he had rested irom the fatigues of travel a reply would be sent. It was well known that a great deal of discussion was going on with regard to the Convention, but as no reply was received the British Agent at Kabul, who was about to proceed on short leave to India early in March, was instructed to ask the Amir before his departure of he had any communication to make on the subject. Ihe Amir replied m the negative, stating that lie had been severely ill for some time, and was unable at ^present to attend to state business.112 No answer being received the Secretary of State for India directed that a direct reply of some sort must be elicited. Accordingly a letter dated 6tb August 1908 was sent to the Amir, in which the Amir was asked to send an early reply to the Viceroy’s letter of the 10th September 1907. On the 16th September a letter, dated 14th August 1908, was received from the Amir by the hand of the Afghan Envoy. The Amir merely forwarded the opinion ot his State Council on the Convention and expressed no opinion on his own befall. The opinion of the Council was not at all favourable to the Convention. They maintained that its terms were inimical both to Afghan and British interests. The reply extended to 54 pages in which many extraneous subjects were dis cussed such as the treaties concerning Persia and Tibet, the British-Japanese treaty, and the strategy connected with the defence of India and Afghanis tan etc., etc. The receipt of this letter was at once acknowledged by the Viceroy, hut a reply was not despatched until the 8th December 1908 when it was endeavoured to combat the objections of the Council and to prove to them that the treaty was really framed in the interests of Afghanistan. In the meantime intimation was received that the Russian Government was quite prepared to abide by the terms of the Convention, even though the formal consent of the Afghan Gov ernment was not received. As reported in last year’s summary the British Agent at Kabul, Fakir Saiyid Iftikhar-ud-din, wished to resign his appointment. The Amir, however, did not approve of the Government’s nomination of the Hon'ble Malik Umar Hayat Khan, Tiwana, CUE., to be his successor. Accordingly a few weeks’ leave was granted to Pakir Saiyid Iftikhar-ud-din, who reached India on the 11th March and rejoined his appointment at Kabul on the 12th June. The position of Muhammad Ali Khan Rana, British Representative at Kandahar, did not improve. The Amir requested that he might he recalled as his conduct had passed the stage of tolerance. Apparently charges were trumped against him with a view to obtaining possession of the house that had been occupied by successive news-writers for many years. The Representative was shortly requested to vacate his house and instructed to reside in an inferior dwelling in a filthy locality. Neither in the matter of houses nor in other respects do the Afghan authorities reciprocate the favoured treatment granted to their Envoy at Government head-quarters. Internal. Reports are most conflicting with regard to the respective relations of the Amir and his brother, Sardar Nasarulla Khan, in the Government of the king dom. There seems little doubt that the Amir is of an indolent turn of mind and quite prepared to delegate the management of affairs to other people. An impression is, therefore, gained that Nasarulla Khan is virtually responsible for the control of State affairs; on the other hand ample proof is forthcoming that the Amir is quite capable of taking up the reins when he considers it to be necessary. Sardar Nasarulla Khan undoubtedly fosters the anti-British spirit that is only too apparent in Eastern Afghanistan. It is not certain whether this is done on his own initiative or under the secret instigation of the Amir. The Amir seems to be genuinely anxious to improve the corrupt adminis tration of local officials. Several officials have been recalled to render their accounts and have been dismissed if the investigation did not prove satisfactory. Lawlessness and disorder seem to be on the increase. Under the present regime the punishment of delinquents is not carried out with the same ruthless severity as under the late Amir. The result is that all travellers complain of the insecurity of the roads. Gangs of armed men are met everywhere and superiority of force is the only safeguard for the protection of property. Even the troops of the Amir, stationed on the road between Kabul and Landi Kotal for the preservation of order, rob and plunder wayfarers freely. The European employes of the Amir and the British Agent at Kabul reported that on their way to and from Kabul they were only protected with difficulty by their escorts from open violence.In the Zadran country there were symptoms of slight rebellion early in the year, but the arrival of troops was sufficient to bring the people to their senses Work was continued on the bridge over the Kabul river below the Communications. Darunta gorge, but had to be suspended during the summer months on account of the flo ds. It is expected that it will be completed by the end of the winter. The authorities at Kabul appear to have determined that the best alignment for a cart-road between Kabul and Jalalabad lies neither along the Kabul river, nor over the Lataband pass, but along the ancient road, used in the 1st Afghan War, through the Khurd Kabul pass. During the latter part of the year work on this road was in progress. The Amir is apparently anxi ous to open up a road fit for his motor car between Kabul and Jalalabad. The heavy rains in June did a great deal of damage to the Tangi-Gharu route which is now reported as impracticable for all but pedestrians. A good deal of labour seems to have been expended during the year on the Kandahar-Kabul road, which according to the report of Mr. Fennel, the Amir’s chauffeur, is now better than the road between Quetta and Ghaman. Water-carts and a steam roller were imported into Afghanistan via Chaman. Work was commenced on the reconstruction of the ancient Chograk canal, which takes off from the Helmand 24 miles above Girishk. As the work is being executed entirely by forced labour it is not very popular. The canal is to be called the Nahr-i-Saraj and will reopen a large portion of the country to cultivation. The boot factory at Kabul commenced work under Mr. Thornton. The average daily output is about 60 pairs of boots. Unusually large numbers of tribesmen and mullas have flocked to Kabul during the past year from tribal territory on the British side of the Durand line. In all probability the trade in rifles, which is a very lucrative profession, attract ed a large number. Still the Afghan authorities, by means of allowances and other expressions of friendship, do everything in their power to encourage visits of the tribesmen to Kabul. They evidently realise that friendly relations with the tribes afford a powerful lever in their dealings with the British Government. The common bonds of Islam serve as a pretext for inciting the tribes to remain a perpetual thorn in the side of the British Government. Sardar Nasarulla Khan held the majority of the durbars to which the tribesmen were invited. The principal mullas in Afghanistan have been most active during the Activity of Mulla9( past year. Having been foiled in their attempts to raise a jehad against the British in the early part of the year, they have been unceas ing in their efforts to keep alive the hostile spirit, and to induce the public to believe that war between the Afghan and British Governments is inevitable. The death of the notorious Sufi Sahib occurred in December. A severe blow was given to the Afghan authorities by the raid of suitanpur raid, a gang of Zakka Khel and Shinwaris on a village near Suitanpur in the Jalalabad district. The raiders had little success, and were roughly handled, but the mere fact of it being possible that Afridis should commit a daring raid against Afghan subjects appears to have given rise to much indignation. Certain Afridis suggested that the tribe should take joint action for the punish ment of the offenders, but it is consoling to note that up to date no greater success has been attained than in the case of similar proposals for the punish ment of raiders into British territory. Mr. Hayden, of the Geological Survey of India, resigned his appointment European employs with the Amir, as apparently no real interest was taken in developing the o£teAau^, resources of the country and he had been subjected to a great deal of discourtesy and hostility from Afghan officials. His resignation was accepted. Messrs. Gentleman and Thornton left the Amir’s service during the year under the pretext of proceeding on leave. They were so alarmed at the anti- European feeling in the country and aUhe perils of the journey on the road to India, that it is unlikely that they will return. Mrs. Alice van Ingen, the Amir’s lady doctor, and her sister Mrs. Cooper Abbs, both left the Amir’s service.114 The Amir’s brother Sardar Muhammad Umar Jan was married on the 27th May. The Amir contributed 3 lakhs of rupees to his mainage expenses. Epidemics of cholera and small-pox broke out rather severely in the eastern districts of Afghanistan. There was an excellent autumn harvest m Afghan istan. Military. Genuine efforts seem to have been made to promote the efficiency of the Afghan army. This has undoubtedly been due to the war scare which continued to recur throughout the year. A few Turks under Mahmud Sami Effendi have been entrusted with the drill and instruction of the army at Kabul. Uniform is now issued free to regiments at Head-quarters. Pay of the private soldier has been increased from Rs. 6 to Rs. 8 (Kabuli) and has been disbursed with greater regularity than previously. Old and weakly men have been weeded out, while there are even rumours of pensions being granted to men of long service. Constant reports have been received of regularity in parades, hill manoeuvres and musketry, in all of which the Amir himself has been evincing unusual interest. All reporters are satisfied that a real improvement has been effected. It seems certain, however, that the strenuousness exhibited will only be temporary and will rapidly evanesce if the possibility of hostilities becomes more remote. The supposed imminence of war added a certain stimulus to recruiting, but even so it has been found necessary to resort to the rule of enlisting 1 out —n of 8 of the male population by compulsion, so as to keep battalions near the 0 j requisite strength. The importation of 10,000 M. L. E. rifles and 10 million rounds, reported jf in last year’s summary, was completed early in the year. As far as can be ascertained new rifles have only been issued to the 6 orderly regiments at Kabul. A small consignment of modern rifles and ammunition, imported under the seal of Sardar Nasarulla Khan, was detained in India pending a reply from the Amir, who was asked whether he wished that rifles and ammunition should he passed on the authority of any other signature than his own, or whether the practice approved by him in 1906 should he adhered to. Up to date no reply has been received and the consignment has not yet been for warded. Further large consignments of transport carts reached Kabul, but, except as already stated, no serious efforts appear to have been made to improve the roads, which alone can render them useful. Orders were given for the formation of 2 nfew regiments from the people of Ningrahar, recruits being obtained from the Khugianis, Shinw r aris and Ut Khel, and of 1 regiment of Heratis. Trade in Gulf riflei. , The trade in gulf rifles continued brisk throughout the year. It was calculated that 30,000 rifles and 3 million rounds of ammunition were imported from the Persian Gulf during the cold weather of 1907-1908. Almost all the caravans appear to have passed direct from Persian to Afghan territory and thus escaped the British force at Robat. The Persian authorities proved quite incapable of dealing with the situation. One caravan endeavoured to pass through British territory, hut finding its way blocked turned back in time to escape. A great number of these rifles were re-exported to tribes on the British side of the Durand line. The trade is a lucrative one, and produces profits of about 100 per cent. It is reported that the Afghan authorities give every encouragement to the trade, both by giving advances from State treasuries to the merchants and also by giving advances on suitable security to indigent tribesmen who wish toprovidethemselveswithrifl.es. The trade is, moreover, exempted by the Amir’s orders from payment of any duties, On the 14th September a small arms caravan, consisting of six men and four camels, while attempting to cross the trade route near Nushki Chah was attacked by a party of the Chagai levies ; the leader of the caravan was killed and the remainder captured, together with 30 rifles, 2 revolvers and 1,200rounds of ammunition. The caravan belonged to Nausherwan, brother of the late Sardar Muhammad Umar, who is said to be in financial straits and eking out a precarious existence in Afghanistan by dealing in rifles which his men smuggle through to Garmsel. Messrs. Treacher and Co., obtained permission to import for the Amir:— 1,000 3-pounder brass empty cartridge cases. 1,000 5-pounder brass empty cartridge cases. 500 6-pounder brass empty cartridge cases. 500 9 pounder brass empty cartridge cases. The two latter were obtained from the Polte Manufacturing Company of Magdeburg in Germany, and the others from Messrs. Kynoch in England. NORTH-WEST ERONTIER. Kashmir. The year was marked by the completion of the electric power scheme, The opening ceremony took place on the 21st September, when power at 30,00i) volts was transmitted to Baramula for the purpose of operating the dredging fleet, which has been constructed there, and to Srinagar for operating the silk factory. These places are distant 20 and 50 miles respectively from the power station. The whole system worked without the slightest hitch. Gilgit. The year was uneventful. A new suspension bridge over the Indus was completed at Jiliper. Raja Sifat Bahadur, Governor of Punial, requested permission to resign the Governorship and proceed to Darel, where the people were tired of the exactions of Mehtar Jao Pakhtun Wall. He was dissuaded, howeve'*, from carrying out his intention. Chitral. Captain Hayden, Supply and Transport Corns, visited Chitral to arrange if possible for the procuring locally of all supplies required by the garrison, but after a long consultation with the Mebtar came to the conclusion that the country could not produce any more surplus grain and fodder than at present. On the 17th Eebruary rewards and certificates were presented to those who had rendered conspicuous help to the relieved Ohitral force when crossing the Lowarai pass in October 1907. After the presentation the Mehtar addressed the people and exhorted them to lose no opportunity of rendering service to Government. About the middle of May a report reached Chitral that Afghans were about to attack Arandu or Drosh. The scare proved groundless, but was useful in that it enabled the Mehtar of Chitral and the Chitralis to give evidence of their loyal intentions. Martini-Henry rifles were issued to the Mehtar’s body guard in place of worn out Snider ritles. Owing to the good behaviour of the tribes on the Chakdara-Drosh road revised arrangements were approved for the Chitral reliefs No escorting regiment was to accompany regiments moving in relief and the movable column was not to proceed beyond the Malakand. Two additional mountain guns were to accompany the regiments on relief. On account of cholera, how ever, the reliefs had to be postponed till next year. Buner, Black Mountain, etc. / This portion of the frontier has been exceptionally quiet during the past year. At the time of the disturbances in Mohmand country a party of Hindu stani fanatics moved into Swat with a view to participating in any jehad that might be impending, but they received no encouragement from the people of Swat, in fact they received a distinct intimation that if they persisted in advancing they would be forcibly resisted. They returned without incrimiuciting themselves to their own settlements.116 Saiyid Firoz Shall of Sitana and Malka died early in the year. The trihes- men concerned unanimoasly selected Abdul Jabar Shah as the.r leader and gave the necessary sureties. The Government of India gave Abdul Jabar Shall per- mission to reside at Sitana. The people of Jalkot in the Indus Kohistan committed a series of raids on the Abbottabad—Chilas road near the Babusar Pass in September. Dir, Swat and Bajatjr. The year 1907 had been marked by perpetual internal warfare in Dir and Baiaur, but towards the close of the year the tribesmen had evinced a desire for a settlement of their difficulties. After protracted negotia tions a temporary truce for six months was arranged early in January, durin°’ which interval it was hoped that more effective arrangements could be made. The results have been satisfactory. In September it was sur mised that the Nawab of Dir was losing his influence owing to mismanage ment and that a movement in favour of his brother Miangul Jan was developing. Still nothing serious occurred and the year has been extraordinarily peaceful. The settlement of tribal differences came at a most opportune moment, for it enabled the tribesmen to show a united front in their opposition to endeavours to suborn their allegiance to the British Government at a critical period. It could hardly be expected that the wave of fanaticism, which spread from Zakka Khel to Mohmand country and involved the eastern tribesmen of Afghanistan, would fail to meet with some response in Dir, Swat and Bajaur. The small extent to which it spread and the determined manner in which the majority of the tribesmen refused to join in the revolt is as great a source of satisfaction to us as it must have been a cause of mortification to the instigators. The Hindustani Fanatics from Buner induced the Sartor Fakir to join in a small demonstration, which never assumed alarming proportions owing to the determined attitude of the clansmen in Swat. From Nawagai, Ambahar and Babu Kara certain turbulent spirits threatened to destroy the Panjkora bridge, but the ^ Nawab of Nawagai sent in timely information. The concentration of Dir levies at the bridge itself and the firm front shown by the Khans of Dir, Jandol and Nawa gai with tribal lashkars prevented the minority from doing any mischief. While the Mohmand operations were in progress, undoubtedly certain enter prising spirits joined the forces fighting against the British Government. The Nawab of Navagai suggested that a British brigade should be sent to punish the villages implicated in conjunction with a tribal lashkar led by himself. The suggestion was not acted upon as it was quite evident that this demonstra- lion of loyalty was coupled with a desire to improve his position by wresting hack from his son Muhammad Ali the Chiefship of Nawagai. The commendations of the Viceroy were conveyed to the tribes for the part they played in the defence of the Panjkora bridge, and at the end of the disturbances a notification was issued conferring upon Badshah Khan, Khan of Dir, the title of Nawab in recognition of his services. A satisfactory incident of the year was the public reconciliation in July of the Nawab of Nawagai with his eldest son, Muhammad Ali Khan, and the re-instalment of the former in the position of ruler of Nawagai from which he had been ousted by Muhammad Ali. With the full consent of all the minor Khans the Nawab proceeded to Nawagai and resumed the reins of Government, while Muhammad Ali publicly declared himself to be his servant on the condition (a) that he is recognised by the Nawab and all concerned as the Nawab'sheir, and (6) that his younger brother Ahmad Jan is not allowed to live with his father in Nawagai. The Political Agent Malakand visited Swat Kohistan during July and proceeded through country which had not previously been visited by a European. He was much impressed by the superiority of the armament of the tribes of Dir as compared with the weapons which they possessed six years ago. Formerly the Khans personally possessed B. L. rifles, and their followers muzzle-loading weapons only. The latter have now become as rare as the more modern weapon is common.Miangul Jan, brother o£ the Nawab of Dir, was married to the daughter of the Nawab of Nawagai in October At a review held by His Excellency the Commander in-ChieE at Peshawar in November, two companies of Dir Levies were present. Land rates for the Malakand canal were finally settled, and the taking over of the land was commenced before the end of the year. Mohmands. During the winter of 1907-1903 the Baezai and Khwaizai, who with the exception of the Musa Khel of Mitai do not receive British allowances, were in an unsettled state. The activity of mullas while the Bazar expedition was in progress still further agitated them. A considerable number of Mohmands collected to assist the Zakka Khel against whom an expedition w as sent in February, but arrived too late to take part in the proceedings. On their return in March they committed a series of raids in British territory. Ghulam Khan, a friendly Isa Khel chief, living at Dagh in Pandiali, rescued a British Hindu subject from a gang of raiders. This apparently infuriated the rest of the tribe, who collected a formidable lashkcir with a view to exacting reparation from Ghulam Khan and also to executing a raid on a large scale in the Peshawar district. The latter object was partially frustrated by an increase of military garrisons along the border, but the lashkar succeeded in burning one of the villages of Ghulam Khan, wdio himself took refuge in British territory. On the 21st April a party of Mob mauds crossed the border and fired on a standing patrol. On the 22nd attacks were made on Matta and the Garhi Sadar post. As large gatherings of the tribesmen were observed on the hills across the border columns from Shabkadar and Matta, consisting of all available troops, attacked the enemy simultaneously on 24-th April in their position w r est of Shabkadar and Matta. The enemy were driven out of their sangars. Their loss must have been severe, as they retired promptly to Kamali and the Bohai Dag. Ample evidence was forthcoming that the Mohmands were actively supported by Afghans and Afghan mullets. Notwithstanding this gross provocation attempts were made to call in the jirqas and to settle the matter by negotiations. The attempts proved abortive, for while the nearer Mohmands with a stake in British districts gave temporising answers, the other Mohmands definitely refused to come in. Accordingly a scheme for the organisation and mobilisation of a force to punish the Mohmands for their unprovoked attacks on the administrative border was sanctioned. The commencement of the actual operations w 7 as delayed by an interlude which occurred in the Khaibar direction. The attack by Afghans on the foils of Landi Kotal and Michni Kandao necessitated the temporary postponement of the advance into Mohmand country, while the Afghan tribesmen were driven back beyond the border. No sooner had this been done, than 2 biigades proceeded to enter Mohmand country. A cavalry reconnaissance was made to Hand on the 12th May and on the 13th May the force crossed the frontier. The Tarakzai and Gandao Halimzai/irt/as accompanied the force and rendered various services. The former (Tarakzai) guaranteed the immunity of the line of march up to the crest of the Karappa pass, which forms the limits of their territory ; this enabled piquetting to be dispensed with in the advance through the intricate country lying between Hand and the Karappa. During the operations in Mohmand country the tribesmen were apparently disheartened by the failure of the Afghans to support them in earnest and by the heavy losses that had been sustained in the tight at Matta. Although several determined attacks were made on camps at night, notably at Darwazagai and at Nahaki on two occasions and although at Umra Kalai, Kargba and in the Bohai Dag considerable opposition w r as met with, still the resistance was not so severe as seemed probable at the commencement of the operations. As the Durand boundary in Mohmand country has not been demarcated great care was taken to confine hostilities to undisputed territory so as to avoid all possibility of offending Afghan susceptibilities. Koda Khel in the Lohai Dag was the utmost limit to which the troops penetrated to the west, while to118 the north a column crossed the Lakarai Kotal and returned via the Pipal valley and the Kota Taraf pass to Mulla Kalai, punishing the Ambabar Utman Khel by destroying the principal villages in their valley en route. The operations terminated with the complete submission of all the assured clans. Ajirgaoi these clans and of the Khwaizai clan met the General Officer in command of the force at Ghalanai on the 30th May and undertook to prevent the Baezai, whom they named as the originators of all the trouble, from entering their territory. The last troops re-crossed the frontier on the 2nd June. It was hoped that a satisfactory settlement had been arrived at, but this has not proved to be the case. It has been supposed that this may be due to the fact that at the close of the expedition the tribesmen were not received formally in durbar and informed that Government had no further designs against them, Afghan intrigue is also probably responsible for a good deal of the unrest that has been noticed. A great number of Mohmands visited Kabul and from all accounts received a good deal of sympathy in their misfortunes. As a result there has been a general feeling of insecurity along the border owing to the probability of further raids. In August a large raid was made on Hajizai. Several Hindus were carried off. This was traced to a gang of Kandahari Safis and Koda Khel Mohmands The jirgas of the Tarakzai, Gandao Halimzai, Burhan Khel and Isa Khel, through whose territory the raiders must have passed, were summoned to Peshawar. It was impressed on them that they were responsible for the passage of raiders through their country. They pro mised to do their best to bring back the Hindus, who had been carried off. They succeeded in doing so. A proposal has now been put forward for the creation of a Political Agency for the charge of the Mohmands. It is considered that an officer in sole charge of the Mohmands might succeed in creating a strong pro-British party. This will doubtless be effected by an increase of allowances. No decision has yet been arrived at. Afeidis and Khaibar tribes. The attitude of the Afridi sections, excluding the Zakka Khel, has on the whole been satisfactory throughout the year. Their loyalty was put to a severe test on various occasions when Afghan officials and mullas made strenuous endeavours to excite hostility against the British Government. The Zakka Khel, continuing the lawlessness of previous years, opened the year with seve ral serious raids. Early in January His Majesty’s Government was again re quested to sanction the adoption of punitive measures. The Government of India, convinced that an expedition conducted on former lines could have no lasting effect, proposed that in the first place the whole Afridi jirga should be once more summoned to Peshawar, and that they should be informed that if they could not undertake to exact reparation for their many misdeeds from the Zakka Khel, the British Government would adopt such measures as appeared advisable. It was explained to His Majesty’s Government that these measures would include the recovery of a fine and the disarmament of the Zakka Khel section; a road similar to the Khaibar road being constructed through the Bazar valley. The Secretary of State correctly surmised that these proposals of the Government of India would entail virtual annexation of the Bazar valley. 'While sanctioning an expedition against the Zakka Khel be laid down that neither immediately nor ultimately, directly nor indirectlv, must any an nexation be involved at the close of the expedition, and that the duration of the operations must be strictly limited. ^ V( ' r y ^ me communications on the subject were passing between tire Home and Indian Governments a large gang of Afridis eclipsed all previous exploits by raiding m the very heart of Peshawar city on the night of 28-29th anuary. ne policeman was killed, two policemen and two chowkidars were wounded, while p operty valued at over a lakh of rupees was carried off.

On the 15th February two brigades entered the Bazar valley from Ali Masjid, a small column entering from Landi Kotal via the Bazar Kandao. The advance was practically unopposed. The force remained in the neighbourhood of China for 14- days. The enemy con fined themselves entirely to their usual tactics of sniping and following up rear guards. On the 27th February the Afridi jirga with many Zakka Khel came in and were received in open durbar, when they handed in a petition in which they agreed to apportion responsibility for the good behaviour of the Zakka Khel sections among the Afridi clans in the following manner : Paindai ... ... Jamal Khel Khusrogis Sahib Khel half of the Anai... Shan Khel cf Bara and Tirah Mohib Khel half of the Anai... Zia-ud-din Khusrogi except Jamal Khel,,, Bara Pakhai ... ... ^Malikdin Khel. ... Kambar Khel. ... Kuki Khel and Niki Khel Pakhai of Khaibar. ... Sipah Kbel. ... Kamrai. »•* Khaibar Pakhai. They also promised that when called upon they would assist each other in punishing bad characters, and agreed that Government might punish them by fine, exclusion from British territory or in any other way for the misdeeds of the Zakka Khel sections for whom they stood security. As regards the leaders of the raids into British territory, they asked to be allowed, with the assistance of the Zakka Khel elders, to undertake their punishment to the satisfaction of Government. This last condition they have proved quite unable, or unwilling, to fulfil. Multan, the leader of many raiding gangs, has spent the greater part of the year in Afghanistan, where he lives in receipt of a Kabul allowance. It has been reported that he returns occasionally to Tirah ; on such occasions he is received with acclamation by the general populace and treated as a hero, and the maliks have not been successful in taking coercive measures. He suc ceeded in carrying out a daring raid on Aman Kot, north-west of Pabbi, in the month of December. A settlement having been formally concluded, the British force left the Bazar valley on the 29th February. At the time of trouble in the Mohmand country unrest was again manifest in Eastern Afghanistan. On the 25th April reports were received that an Af ghan lashkar was being collected under the Mulla Sufi Sahib to attack Landi Kotal, on the 1st May half the lashkar advanced towards Landi Kotal, while the other half under Sufi Sahib himself moved towards China in the hope of raising the Afridis. Attacks were made on the posts of Michni Kandao and Landi Kotal, but the enemy were driven off without difficulty. On the 3rd May reinforcements under Major-General Sir J. VFillcocks arrived at Landi Kotal, and on the 4th May the enemy were driven back across the frontier. Meanwhile the Afridis had stood firm to their recent undertakings, and the Sufi Sahib recrossed the Afghan border on the 5th May. The conduct of the Shinwaris of Loargai throughout the attacks on Michni Kandao and Landi Kotal was noteworthy. They held all the hills to the north of Landi Khana and prevented their occupation 'by the enemy. Their Malik, Mir Akbar, was especially rewarded with an annual allowance of Rs. 1,000. As a special recognition of their good services a grant of pensions at local corps Grant of Pensions rates was sanctioned for the Khaibar Rifles, The concession was conditional on to Khaibar Rlfles - the men accepting liability to service in any area in time of war or disturbance, actual or threatened, and also the provisions of a special militia regulation. A grant of one year’s allowance was also made to all sections of the Afridis and Khaibar tribes, except the offending Zakka Khel sections, in recognition of their refraining from hostilities against Government both during the Bazar valley expedition and also when instigated by Afghan mullas.120 The feud between the Malikdin Khel and Kambar Khel continued through out the year. The mullas made various efforts to patch up a truce, but peace had no sooner been declared than fighting recommenced with as much animosity as ever. Loi shiiman Bail* ^t the time of the Mohmand expedition it was considered advisable to ay * cease work on the Loi Shiiman railway. Resumption of work was _ then defer- red until the autumn owing to the unsuitability of the climate during the hot weather, which had caused several casualties among the Europeans in the pre vious year. In autumn a scheme was brought forward for constructing a 2' 6' railway instead of a broad-gauge railway. The matter is now under discussion and w ork is still held in abeyance. vuits to Kabul. A great many Afridis have been constantly going and coming to and from Kabul during the year. A great deal of this movement is undoubtedly due to the trade in Gulf rifles, which has continued brisk. The Adam Khel especially have purchased large quantities of rifles and retailed them to tribesmen all round the border. Caravans of rifles openly passed up and down the Khaibar. This practice has now been stopped and all dealers must keep to tribal terri tory. On visiting Kabul in summer the Afridis only received half allowances, and were promised the remaining half later in the year at Jalalabad. It is not certain whether this action of the Afghan authorities is due to annoyance because the Afridis did not join a jehad against the British, or whether it is simply due to a desire to increase the frequency of Afridi visits to Afghan territory so as to foster Afghan influence over them. On the 12th November the Khaibar maliks and elders gave a garden party to the Chief Commissioner in the Shahi Bagh at Peshawar, They invited the European residents of Peshawar as well as the elders of all the neighbouring tribes, the Orakzais, Adam Khel, Mohmands, etc., etc. Ktjkkam. The attitude of the inhabitants of the Kurram valley has continued most satisfactory throughout the year. On more than one occasion it appeared that an invasion of the Kurram valley by Afghans was imminent, and the Turis seemed to be only too anxious for an opportunity of demonstrating their loyalty to the British Government and their intention to uphold the present regime at all costs. Raids from Afghan territory, principally from the direction of Khost, ' were fairly numerous. Notwithstanding the fact that the Brigadier of Khost sent to the Political Agent of Kurram a friendly letter, in which he expressed a desire to suppress transborder raids, there seems little doubt that the Khost authorities were w 7 ell aware of—if they did not actually instigate—many of the raids. Three raiding parties made their headquarters in Khost. The most serious raid was committed on the flocks of the village of Khapianga. The villagers lost 193 head of cattle, 420 sheep and goats, two men killed and one Government Snider. In Pebruary another raid was made on some Kuchi encampments, a few miles from the camp of the Shabak grazing guard. Although the raiders carried off some Rs. 4,000 worth of property, they suffered severely at the hands of the Turi pursuit party and a few men of the Kurram Militia, who came up with them. They lost at least seven killed. Trouble »t Khar- In Upper Kurram during April, and about the time of the reopening of the Tor Kham incident, there was fighting on the Kharlachi-Afghan border. It seems probable that this had only local significance, although at the time it appeared to be perhaps connected with the disturbances elsewhere. One Khan- gul, a Mukbil of Pathan, a notorious thief who w^as the perpetrator of many burglaries and murders in Kurram, organised what appeared to be a local anti- Shia jehad from the neighbouring Afghan villages and declared his intention of waging war on the Duparzai Turis round Kharlaohi. Proceedings began with an attack on the Barki cattle, but the Turis being prepared got these off without loss. The Afghan lashkar then took up a position further within the Kurram border, threatening Kharlaehi and Barki. After considerable firing the Turis turned them out. On one night some Turis who had scores against Khangul raided his121 'isable | ^ defei, the luj the pfji, ga2'r tscus&gt;ioj from yduefe !s peciaHj smen all Khaibar, bal terri- Wances, It is not Dojanco er it is ifglian i part/ ed the loniing .ed most red that ie Turk r loyalty pme at !

The lashkar followed them up and again threatened Kharlachi; they were discovered and after a long fight were forced to retire, taking one dead or wounded man with them and leaving one dead man in a savgar, well within the Kurram border. The next day was oc cupied in burying the dead, but on the following day another attack was made and repulsed. Similar desultory fighting continued, throughout May, but final ly in June the combatants themselves concluded a truce for two years. Endeavours were made to induce the Jajis to break the two years truce that they had made with the Turis during the previous year, but proved unsuc cessful. The Kham Khel section of the Ohamkannis again gave considerable Khei trouble. They were responsible for numerous raids, and kidnapped various Chamkannia - British subjects. At the end of September, however, during a tour of the Chief Commissioner m Ivuiram, the entire Chamkanni came in. The represent atives of the Khani Khel section, who had absented themselves for a number of years, now petitioned that a settlement should be concluded with them. As their attitude was satisfactory, an agreement was concluded. The Khani Khel then released the kidnapped persons. The Zaimukht tribe, except for occasional thefts by the bndmcish element has been well behaved and well disposed. . Repairs were carried out on the Thal-Parachinar road during the year, hut owing to lack of bridges and metalling danger of suspension of traffic is always imminent. The urgency of metalling this road lias been pointed out. The Parachinar-Paiwar Kotal road has fallen into a disgraceful state of repair. The urgency of extending the broad gauge railway to Thai has also been put forward. Owing to the unsettled state of affairs in Kurram the Government of India sanctioned the issue of Lee-Metford rifles to the Kurram Militia. The rifles had actually arrived at Parachinar when, the immediate crisis being averted, it was decided not to issue them. The rifles and ammunition are still lying un opened in the Paracbinar fort, and no orders for their disposal have yet been issued. Waziejstan. The state of affairs in Waziristan has been as unsatisfactory as ever. The Mahsucs again have been the originators of all the trouble ; the Earwesh Khel maintained friendly relations with the British Government. Kaids into British territory have been frequent and exceptionally serious. There is little doubt that, but for extraordinary vigilance on the part of the local authorities, the outrages would have been still more numerous. The only redeeming feature lies m the fact that the Mahsud malike, when interviewed in jirga, have in- vanably manifested a friendly spirit and a desire to control the tribe. The disinchnat 10 ! 1 of Mahsuds to acknowledge any authority renders it extremely “u i • . en: ; 0 J’ ce an y responsibility for offences committed. Added to this, the decision of Government in October 1907 not to recognise the Mnlla Powin- dah m any of the dealings with the tribe has caused that individual to exert himself unceasingly m his endeavours to prove that no settlement can be effect ed with the Mahsuds without his assistance. He has frustrated every effort of the maliks to coerce recalcitrant sections, and has alternated his threats of ven geance on Government with letters to the Political Agent in which he pro- fesses that he is in reality a friend of the Government and requests that he may again be restored to favour. Notwithstanding his proved complicity in many crimes, the Chief Commissioner has recently expressed his opinion that no satisfactory settlement can be made with the Mahsuds, if the Mulla is ignor ed altogether. ° Minor raids have been frequent during the year. Murders and robberies nave been of weekly occurrence, but the first serious outrage occurred on the 13th March, when the Political Agent's munshi, bearer and camel sowar, proceeding cm leave under escort of a Mahsud badraga, were attacked in the Khwuzhma -Nala by a party of Abdur Bahman Khel Mahsuds and outlaws under Mianji. e-r* 1 ;™ ^ arer Were killed and the camel sowar w r ounded. As the wlf ^ u n ^ definit . el ? acce Pted responsibility for the deeds of these outlaws, o ad been in their country for over 10 days, a seizure of all Mahsuds and122 their cittle in the protected area and British territory was ordered. This re sulted in the capture of 378 men and 1,845 animals. The Mahsud jirqa was then interviewed at Tank. Their attitude was friendly, but they expressed their inability to control outlaws or the Mulla. It was explained to tlie jirga that the forfeiture of their allowances, which had been decided on last year, would continue and that their restoration would depend on their future behaviour. In compliance with a request of the maliks orders were given that no Mahsud trading caravans should enter British territory without the security of a mabk. It was hoped that in this way the hands of the maliks would be strengthened but this has not proved to be the case. Shortly after this the men seized, and most of the cattle, were released. Opportunity was taken, however, to settle some outstanding cases against offenders who had been caught. The next serious outrage occurred on the 16th May, when the Jemadar at Girni post hearing some shots in the hills took out 14 men to investigate. The party was ambushed by about 20 Mahsuds, just inside the Girni Kalan Pass. One naick escaped with his rifle. Two wounded men got off without their arms. The rest were kilted. This outrage occurred only 6 days after the Mahsud jirga had been interviewed at Wana. At this interview the maliks had pressed for the restoration of their allowances, but werednformed that this was impossible until they took steps to restore order in the country. In forwarding a detailed report on the attack on the Girni garrison Sir H. Deme wrote “ we are again confronted with an impasse in our dealings with Mahsuds. While I adhere to the belief that the only real solution of this queslim lies in permanent occupation as advocated by me last October, I un derstand that His Majesty’s Government have definitely pledged themselves to permit no permanent occupation of tribal territory. Ibis being so I can only recommend punitive measures on the lines recently followed in the Mohmand country.” Sir H. Deane meanwhile was invalided home, and on the advice of his successor, Colonel Roos-Keppel, the Government of India determined to try and remedy the present state of affairs by appointing Mr, J. Donald as Resident to hold political charge of the whole of Waziristan over the heads of the Political Agents at Wana and m the Tochi. It was suggested that with a view to strengthen ing the hands of tlie maliks, some system of tribal service, such as obtains in Baluchistan, should be instituted among the Mahsuds ; Sir H. Deane, however, had given various reasons why the scheme was impracticable. As a possible palliative at the time he recommended that the Political Agent at Wana should be authorised to pay at once to those maliks who had served him well the allowances due to them on 1st April, and to promise the restoration of allow ances in October next to such sections as conducted themselves well. This recommendation was accepted, notwithstanding the fact that order had not been restored in the country, provided in the meantime the behaviour of the Mabsudswas satisfactory. In an encounter with Mahsud raiders in the Wucha Tiarza Nala on the 7th June, the South Waziristan Militia lost 2 men killed and 2 wounded, but succeeded in killing the notorious Mianji and his cousin Jang, and inflicting several other casualties on the raiders. A reward of Rs. 1,000 was given for the death of Mianji. On the 22nd June a gang of about 50 men believed to be Mahsuds com mitted a raid on Saggu and some other villages in the Kulachi tahsil of Dera Ismail Khan district. Thev killed a lambardar, wounded 2 villagers and carried off much property. As a sequel the raider Surab, a notorious Jat outlaw, was killed before be escaped across the border. On the 22nd July a Mahsud jirga assembled of their own accord at Sarwekai to welcome the new Resident in Waziristan. The^Ypa numbered some 600 men and comprised most of the leading maliks Again their attitude was quite friendly. They freely admitted the unsatisfactory state of affairs and asked that they might be tried again for 6 months. It was arranged that the maliks should discuss the situation with their sections and meet the Resident in a formal jirga in August. The Mulla Powindah moved to Barwand at the beginning of August, and asked for an interview with the Resident. The request was refused, but he was told that he might send in a written representation through the Naib Tahsildar.123 The jirga of Mahsuds commenced to assemble at Sarwekai on the 30th August, and by the 1st September some 4,000 Mahsuds of all sections had arrived. Again the jirga was friendly and full of promises. They asked for an advance of October allowances, but were told that this could not be granted. In the meantime they were requested to busy themselves in obtaining repara tion for the Girni outrage and the dakaiti at Saggu. Although many assurances were given that offending sections would be punished, the maliks quite failed to exercise any authority over the tribe. In an interview with the Political Agent at Wana the maliks plainly stated that there could be no question of tribal good behaviour until a post was established at Kaniguram and the Mulla Powindah driven out of the country, and that they would welcome the taking over of the country by the British. At the end of October the Mulla Powindah, finding his overtures to the British to be ineffectual, paid another visit to Kabul. A difficulty has been experienced in obtaining a sufficient number of Darwesh Khel recruits for the South Waziristan Militia, consequently a proposal has been submitted for reducing the Wazirs in the South Waziristan Militia from 2 companies, 100 rifles strong, and 2 sections of 13 mounted infantry, to 1 company, 150 rifles strong, and 1 section of 13 mounted infantry. An allowance of Ps. 3,000 per annum was sanctioned for the maliks of the Madda Khel Wazirs in addition to the existing allowances enjoyed by the clan which amount to Es. 1,800 per annum. The bridge over the Gumal river at Murtaza on the Kill Kats road was completed. The first 3 miles of the Zhob road from Dera Ismail Khan to Daraban were metalled. BALUCHISTAN. Zhob. Sardar Zarif Khan, Jogezai, who was recently appointed Chief of the Kakar tribe, died at Kila Saifulla on the^ 16th January. His brother, Sardar Muhammad Khan, was appointed Chief in his place. On the 17th April Khatol, Malang and Jilat, Arozai maliks, who emigrated in 1905 with a following of about 60, met the Political Agent at Husain Nika with a view to coming to a final agreement regarding their return to Zhob. After much discussion, which lasted over several days, an agreement was arrived at and the emigrant maliks promised to return to Zhob next spring or by the autumn of 190J at latest. The terms of the agreement allow ~ (1) That no loss will accrue to the tribes from the reservation of the Shinghar forest. (2) That no fine will be imposed on the culprits for the burning of the Shinghar bungalow. The Shiranis of the district are satisfied that a final settlement has been arrived at, and there is inconsequence a greater feeling of security among them. In June 5 families returned and settled in their homes in Zhob. Certain boundary pillars of the Baluch-Afghan boundary on the Zhob frontier were demolished by local Afghan officials early in the year. A formal remonstrance was made to the border Afghan officials, and the pillars were re built later in the year. The Government of India decided not to approach the Amir on the subject unless the pillars were again tampered with by the Afghans, or unless the Amir made any specific complaint on the su ject. On the whole the year was a peaceful one in Zhob although a few^ minor outrages on travellers occurred. Proposals were put forward for an increase of the Zhob Levy Corps, so as to admit of their being able to carry out their duties. A decision has not yet been arrived at. The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan put forward a proposal for the construction of a railway from Khanai to Hindu Bagh on political and commercial grounds. As the suggested line coincided with an alignmen a1 121 hid been surveyed for a broad guage railway through Zliob, the idea was anuroved am l survey for a 2' 6' railway was ordered It was not deemed ex- E to construct abroad gauge railway at present. The survey was not M ulcted at the end of tne year, but m the meantime a private fii , li . s. Birch and Co deputed an engineer to investigate the possibiht.es of opening no the chrome ore industry in which they were interested. As a result of his enouiries they asked Government whether they would be prepared to consider proposals for a light railway and even suggested that they might undeitake to extend the broad gauge. On the 22nd—23rd November a gang of five men, believed to he Shirams, attacked a survey party at Shahalam, near Chaudwan, Hera Ismail khan dis trict. One surveyor and two men were killed, and two men wounded. Quetta-Peshin. On the 8th June Hospital Assistant Abdul Ghafur attached to a survey mrtv working near the Afghan-Baluch boundary unwittingly crossed the border into Afghanistan between boundary pillars 25 and 26. Between these two pillars the river Kadanai bends northwards, and the boundary line, which follows the river bend to pillar 25, runs straight across the base ot the bend to pillar 26. The hospital assistant with his escort was following the road which runs in the river bed, and thus crossed the boundary line. Some Afghan khasodars at once appeared on the scene, and to avoid trouble the hospital assistant made the sepoys retire. The khasadars bred a few shots at the sepoys, who returned the fire killing one khasadar; the remaining khasadars then took off the hospital assistant and his party (except the sepoys) and the camels to an adjacent Afghan levy post. The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan brought the, facts to the notice of the Governor of Kandahar, and asked for the release of the party, and the British representative at Kandahar was instructed to press the matter ; but as the Governor vouchsafed no reply, the Viceroy wrote on the ^nd July to the Amir asking for the release of the men. On the 9th July, apparently before receipt of His Excellency’s letter, the Amir wrote to the Viceroy com- plaining that the party of the Hospital Assistant deliberately crossed the frontier and provoked the quarrel with the khasadars, which resulted m the death of one of the latter. Orders had been given for his release, hut it ^was hoped that compensation would be paid for the heirs of the “ murdered man and that British officials would he warned to abstain from such proceedings in future The Hospital Assistant and party reached Chaman safely on the ^bth July On the 26th August His Excellency the Viceroy thanked the Amir for his letter and added that he readily accepted the suggestion to compensate the heirs of the deceased khasadar, and that Bs. 1,500 would be remitted. At the same time it was pointed out that the Afghan version of the affair was incor rect. The suggested compensation was accepted. Lobalai-Sibi. A complete reconciliation was effected between the Mari and Bugti tribes, who had long been at feud with one another. The Mari chiefs who had been banished from Sibi district executed bonds to he of good behaviour for three years and formally begged for the forgiveness of the Bugti chief, Sir Shahbaz Khan. With a view to encourage the enlistment of Hazaras in the Indian army a Hazara colony was started on the Anambar lands in Loralai. So far the attempt is meeting with every success. South Baluchistan. In South Baluchistan the only items of military importance were the continuance of the rifle importation from the Persian gulf and trouble in Jhalawan country. Owing to the unhealthiness of Robat the detachment of a double company of Native infantry was relieved in January. This detach-125 ment was reinforced by 500 rifles and 2 guns in April, as reports were received that tbe Afghans intended to exact reprisals for the caravan that had been captured in the previous year. At the end of the gun-running season the reinforcement was withdrawn to Quetta, which was reached on the 8th August. The total withdrawal of the whole detachment from Robat has been pro posed to the Secretary of State for India, but sanction has not yet been received. It has been considered that it is impossible for the detachment at Robat to stop the traffic in rifles and that measures for the control of the arms traffic should be taken elsewhere. Pending sanction ro the withdrawal of the force a double company of the 321st Pioneers marched from Nushki on the 18th November to relieve the detachment at Robat, which had suffered owing to the unhealthiness of the place. At the end of July the Mengals in Jhalawan showed signs of giving trouble owing to an unpopular decision of a shahi jirga at Quetta. In April 1907 the Political Agent in Kalat had made a tour in Jhalawan with the object of introducing some administrative reforms. These, as reported in last summary, consisted chiefly in the re-instatement of the real head of the Mengal tribe, Sardar Shakar Khan, who had withdrawn voluntarily in 19 ;3, as Chief of the Mengals and tbe deposition of Mir Wali Muhammad, who had been appointed his Vakil. The change did not prove successful, so a tribal jirga was again held at Quetta. This jirga decided on the 19th July 1908 that Shakar Khan was quite incapable of controlling the tribe, and that Haji Ibrahim Khan, head of the junior branch of the tribe should be appointed Chief of the tribe. It had previously been announced that the Haji had given up all worldly affairs since his visit to Mecca and was quite incapable of any form of government. He is also father of Mir Wali Muham.nad the late Yakil, who had apparently been most unpopular both with the Mengals and the Jam of Las Bela during his Yakilship, On the approach of the Jhalawan Sardars, who were going to instal Haji Ibrahim, Shakar Khan’s party collected a lashka*' to oppose them. At the same time the quarrel broke out afresh between the Mengals and the Jamots of Las Bela, 3 Mengals being murdered at Saruna. 4t the request of the Jam of Las Bela a force of 200 infantry from Karachi was ordered to proceed to Las Bela as a precautionary measure. A force of 300 infantry, 2 guns and a squadron of cavalry was directed to proceed from Quetta to Kalat. The former column left on the 5th August, and the latter left on the 3rd August. All efforts of the Jhalavvan Sardars to induce the Mengal lashkars to disperse proved a failure, but the tribe itself was much divided. Of the 8 main divisions of the Mengals three, led by Alam Khan, Juma Khan and Jangi Khan were in revolt, while three, the Mardvi, Shadmanzai and Muhammadzai were on the side of the new Sardar. The attitude of the other two, the Baranzai and Lahri, was uncertain at first. Haji Ibrahim Khan was able to collect a large lashkar of his own. This action, coupled with the movement of troops from Quetta and Karachi, had a marked effect on the tribe. In a short time the majority of the Mengal headmen tendered submission to the new Sardar, although Alam Khan and Jangi Khan still refused to come in. As the two latter were now threatening to attack Las Bela, the troops at Las Bela were reinforced by a detachment of 100 rifles, which left Karachi on the 24th August. The Kalat column, loss \ squadron, moved on to Wadh. Early in September, in compli ance with a request from the Political Agent, Kaiat, for more troops to be sent to Kalat as a support for the column proceeding to Wadh, an additional force of 500 infantry and 2 guns was sent from Quetta to Kalat. Tbe Political Agent reached Wadh on the 12th September. No opposition was encountered. The rebel leaders still refused to come in until on the 27th September the Political Agent moved to Shakar Khan Kirez, near the land of the rebels, and announced his intention of holding the installation durbar without further delay. This had the desired effect. Baluch Khan, Palezai motabir, went to see the rebel leaders and on the night of the 28th returned to report that Alam Khan was ready to negotiate. Pour leading Sardars went to see him on the 29th and in the evening brought in Alam Khan, Jangi Khan and the other principal men among the rebels. Alam Khan came forward in open durbar127 l instal ^ troon caj.

The events in the campaign of sedition in India which have specially General, attracted public attention during the past year have been the Anarchist out rages, both with bomb and revolver, and the prosecution of inflammatory newspapers and speakers. 2. To the bomb outrages themselves it is unnecessary to refer. It seems Anarchism, undoubtedly true that, as asserted by practically all Indian newspapers and speakers, anarchical ideas influence but a minute fraction of the people: but the disquieting fact remains that the assassins are looked upon by a very large number of persons as heroes—vernacular newspapers have constantly referred to “their pure and unselfish motives ”—while the demonstrations, which have occurred on more than one occasion at the funeral ceremonies of those who have been executed, are a matter of notoriety. Great stress has also been laid on the point that the anarchists have vindicated the courage of the Bengali race, and liave wiped away the stigma of cowardice with which they have been branded for generations : one newspaper asserting that Indians had always known how to die, but now have learnt how to kill. 3. There seems to he no doubt that the instructions for the making of Bomba, bombs which have been published in pamphlet form, largely by the persons responsible for the carrying on of the Yngantar, have been distributed very widely. It has been asserted that they have been circulated in the Punjab, and that they were even intended to reach the frontier tribes, but our agents have been unable to obtain any confirmation of these statements. Expert opinion has been quoted that the recipes thus disseminated are quite practical. The various attempts that have been made against railway trains are apparently due to the fact that—to quote a report of remarks made by the notorious Ajit Singh—English people invariably travel in first and second class compartments, which natives as a rule use but sparingly. 4. The policy of assassination seems to have been seriously discussed by Policy of Assasein- the actively disloyal parly. In particular, an article appeared in the Yu - ation * gantar openly advocating murder of Europeans, and even of their children, by Indian servants and employees : but the abortive attempts on the lives of Messrs, Allen and Hickenbotham seem to have convinced the wire-pullers of the inadvisability of such ideas, the only subsequent instance recorded, in the case of Europeans, being the recent attempt on the life of Sir Andrew Eraser. At the same time, incitement to this method of terrorising Europeans has not been wanting, chiefly in the form of leaflets, one of which drew attention to the fact that “ the scoundrels Minto and Kitchener still dare to drive alone and un guarded about your streets.’* This form of threat has not, however, been con fined to Europeans, notices and anonymous letters having been freely directed against native officials also, warning them of the fate that awaits them if they persist in loyalty to the British. The Chapekar brothers (the Poona murderers of 1897) have been openly lauded in the press, and their photographs widely circulated for sale as specimens of “ Indian heroes.” .5- But though assassination appears to have fallen into disfavour, assaults Assaults on and on and insults to Europeans have been frequent. The opinion of a loyal native inault810 EuI0 I )eanli ‘• is quoted “ that no general rising is to be apprehended, but insults and perhaps more for officers in outlying stations ”. The employment of vitriol is sugo&gt;est- ed, and efforts are made to inculcate a feeling of hatred and contempt for the ruling race. As one vernacular paper puts it, “The charm of the white skin has gone, and hatred and contempt have taken its place,” while in another the English are described as “ a race of pig-beasts rolling in the mire of their sins.” The King himself is not spared, though most of the disloyal party profess to be loyal to him personally, while inveighing against the tyrant bureaucracy that governs in his name : he is described as “no King, but a Devil a Makar128 Cowardice of Eng' lisbrnen. fmriaW kin- ', and so forth. The many instances of hooting and jeering at European^ which have been recorded may not improbably be traced to this propaganda on the part of the native press. 6 A special attempt has been made to prove that the English are degener- ate and cowardly, and that the Government is afraid of the people of India. It is pointed out that the Imperial Service Troops of native chiefs have been accepted for service on the frontier only because the Government fear that the . 1 , i i. +V.£» finvoT'nmpnf. fmvtPft n.Vf&gt; OCCUpied 1 U are The Press. Articles in the Vernacular Press. princes of India might revolt when the Government forces s fiehtino* on the frontier, if their contingents were left at their own disposal. Newspaper articles have harped on “ the cowardice of Englishmen which has frequently been shown on the battlefields of India ”, and have made the most of the panic of Europeans at Lahore and Delhi during the riots of 1907, un- fortunately with, only too much foundation in fact. Vernacular 7. Both vernacular newspapers and lecturers were very active in dissemi- natin^ sedition until lately. Devolution, bomb-throwing and assassination were openly advocated, some of the most virulent newspapers commanding an enormous sale, The newspapers of Bengal, which included the notorious Yuganiar and Sandhya, were the most violently disloyal, with those of Bombay almost equally objectionable, though 1&lt; ss crudely so. No province has been free from the taint of seditious writing, but the press legislation of the year has produced a remarkable improvement in tone, with few exceptions. The Sttarajya of Allahabad, which seemed at one time desirous of putting on the mantle of the defunct Yugantar, and the Aftab of Delhi, together with a few other Punjab newspapers, were the most noticeable of these exceptions: but the Aftab has ceased to exist, and the tone of the vernacular press as a whole is now remarkably mild. Of the Anglo-vernacular papers^ Bande Mataram far outdistanced all compe titors in virulence, and its suppression seems to have had a most salutary effeet, 8. Most violent comments were made in the vernacular press throughout India on the theme of murderous assaults and outrages committed by Europeans on Indians, and the immunity of the former from punishment by the law, to which several most unfortunate cases—notably the “Bawal Pindi rape ease” and the “ Sterling caseat Lahore—have lent only too much justification. A special feature has been the reproduction of seditious articles from other papers, and the publication of seditious leaflets, notices and speeches in the vernacular papers, often on the pretence of publishing the report of a trial for sedition. Attempts to in- 9. A disquieting feature in the press campaign is the statement, which fluence tie rising a pp ears he well substantiated, that seditious newspapers are nowhere more popular than in the zenanas. The actively disloyal party early recognised that it is among students and schoolboys that lies their principal chance of success in popularising revolutionary ideas. The necessity for preserving at least the semblance of discipline in schools and colleges, however, has thrown difficulties in the agitators* way, and by approaching the women they hope to influence the children, who will “ drink in the desire for freedom with their mothers’ milk”. There is, indeed, good reason to suppose that the leaders have deliber ately decided to abandon the policy of an early rising, such as they were un doubtedly working for in 1907, and to try by education ” to prepare the rising generation for a united effort some years hence. 30. Prosecution also seems to have been successful in checking the flood of seditious lectures and speeches which at one time were reported almost daily. It has been noticed as a disquieting symptom that in many cases minor officials, pensioners, reservists, etc., listened to seditious speeches witnout making the slightest attempt to stop them : but the prosecution of several of the most pro minent among the lecturers has apparently dissuaded others from making trial of this method of earning a martyr’s crown.

A lecturer made an even better target for prosecution as, when once the initial difficulty of obtaining evidence sufficient for a prosecution had been surmounted, he could not put forward any paid tool behind whom to shelter himself. But though legislation has thus succeeded in putting a stop to seditious newspapers and speakers, it has so far been obliged to own itself power- Leaflets,songs, etc. less to suppress other more insidious forms of sedition, the superior advantages of which soon became evident to the disloyal party. The country has been flooded with leaflets and placards : objectionable inscriptions on buildings, and particularly in trains, have been frequent: books have been distributed broad cast : quasi-liistorical plays, with a very obvious application, have been freely performed, and so-called “ national ” songs enjoy a wide spread popularity. As regards the latter, there is evidence that the composing and distribution of such songs have been deliberately decided upon as part of the programme of disaffection, and that this scheme has been attended by a very considerable measure of success. 12. The leaflets brought to notice during the past year have been almost innumerable, and have undoubtedly attained a very wide circulation : almost Example8of leaflet ®’ every possible form of misrepresentation and inflammatory writing is to be found etc ' among them. To mention a few of the most prominent:—the “ Message to the Punjabis ” in the Punjab, and “Now or Never ’* in Madras, calling upon the people to blow up railway bridge s and to cut down telegraph lines as a preliminary to a general massacre of Europeans : “ Indian Sepoys ”, exhorting the various races of the Native Army to unite in exterminating the foreigner, or to be doomed to extermination themselves at the hands of the white men, like the Bed Indians, the Tasmanians and the Bushmen before them (these latter were sent in large numbers from London to schoolboys all over India, and dropped on railway platforms and by the side of roads, presumably as a method of dis tribution unattended by danger) : “ O Martyrs ”, a glorification of the “ heroes ” of the Mutiny, with a promise that its diamond jubilee in 1917 should not he allowed to pass without a repetition of it, also distributed broadcast from London : handbills about the jubilee of the Mutiny, distributed in Bombay and reproduced by the Kal newspaper : Tamil leaflets in Madras, enjoining general slaughter of Europeans : placards in Poona, calling upon troops and police to rLe and massacre the English : “ Joyful News ”, placarded freely in Calcutta, urging the people to revolt and send the white devils to hell : the numerous Jvgantar leaflets and the other similar productions containing detailed directions for the manufacture and use of bombs : the “ Appeal ”, pur porting to be from the Anarchist prisoners, asking that 200 white men might be sent to hell on the day that judgment against them should he delivered : the “ Secret Organisation of Russians ”, a detailed description of anarchist secret societies : “ A grave warning”, prophesying revolution and warning the people against investing in Government securities : “ Eamine leaflets ” setting forth the number of people whom Government has done to death by starvation: “ S intan Shiksa ”, pernicious leaflets specially addressed to children at school: and dozens nmre, too many to recount. 13. Hardly less numerous, and certainly no less pernicious, have been the Book*, books published by the disloyal party, most active among the compilers of which have been Ajit Singh and his lieutenant, ^ mba Pershad, in the Punjab. “ Muhibban-i-Watan ”, histories of patriots of all lands : “ Revolution ”, com paring the French and American revolutions with the present state of affairs in India : “ the Victorious Indian Army ”, contrasting the treatment of British and native soldiers, and setting forth the “ rights and claims ” of the Native Army : “ History of the Mutiny of 1857 ”—all published at Lahore : “ End of Tyran nous Empire”, “Tyrannous King and downtrodden Subjects ”, published in Sialkot: books on w*ar tactics, published in Bengali, with special reference to secret organisations and guerilla warfare, and favourably reviewed in the Bengali press as i &gt; precious works ” : collections of articles and speeches, notably those of the notorious revolutionary, Arabinda Ghose, reprinted in pam phlet form—these form a list, by no means exhaustive, which is enough to show the number of such books in existence, and the pernicious nature of their contents.Photons. 14. A further method of popularise? revo utionary ideas has been the distribution of photographs of Indian “ heroes among whom, besides he Chaoekar brothers already alluded to, Khudiram Bose and Profulla Chaki, the Merpore Cb-throwers, and Kauai Lai Butt tie murderer of the mformer Gosain in Alipore jail, have been included. What purports to be a photograph of Sana Sahib, of Mutiny notoriety, has commanded a wide sale ; 5.000 copes are said to have been disposed of in Nasik alone, a reason for its great popu lar- itv being locally supplied by the statement “ that there was soon to tie another incarnation of the Nana.” Pictures of Shivap have also been in circulation : indeed, the cult of Shivaji, the Liberator of Maharashtra from alien tyranny, has been sedulously pushed, and Ramdas, his ‘ guru , who paved the way for Mm by “ covering the country with a network of secret societies , has been only second in popularity to Shivaji himself. Mazzini and Garibaldi have been often aid pointedly compared with, bamdas and Shivaji uhe plotter vho sowed, and the fighter who reaped. secret Societies. 15 . .From the abstract laudation of secret societies to their actual inception is but a step. It has frequently been urged in the disloyal press that there is a great organisation ready to band, sanyasis, sacilius and religious mendicants in general, from among 'whom successors to Ramdas may be looked for : and there is every reason to suppose that such men have been widely employed as agents for the dissemination of revolutionary ideas among the people and the toldiers of the ^Native Armv. Secret societies have been brought into existence, among which the most notorious are the society of anarchists in Calcutta, the ‘ Muhibban*i- Watan ” started by Ajit Singh in the Punjab, and the numerous “ Samitis ” ‘National Volunteers’. Eastern Bengal. r Ihe latter owe their inspiration to the “National \ olun- teer ” movement which, starting in Bengal, has shown signs of spreading throughout India, similar organisations having made their appearance in Bombay, the Central Provinces and the Punjab. There is every reason to hope that the recent legislation against such societies will he effectual in putting a stop to the further spread of this movement, though it is as yet too early to say with any certainty how far this result will he achieved. The organisation of the “ National Volunteers ” has been specially utilised at fairs and concourses of pilgrims, the object being to impress upon the people that a national govern ment—styled “ Bande Mataram ,5 —has been established in Bengal, an idea which is likely to be widely spread by the pilgrims returning to their homes. 16. Besides the National Volunteers, the chief societies in India to which suspicion attaches are the Arya Samaj, the Pan-Islamic Society, and the Singh Sabha. As regards the Arya Samaj, there can he no doubt that this Society, originally started as a purely religious body, has become a great politi cal organisation, whose teachings are directly anti-British. It has been stated by an Arya speaker that among the various branches of activity of the Samaj is “ secret 'work,” as to the nature of which he declined to give any indication : and members of the sect are quoted as saying that until “ Gurukals” (Arya train ing schools) are started in every large town, its full political results could not he looked for. The Arya Samaj claims for itself the credit of having brought about the repeal of the Colonisation Act in the Punjab, and points to this achievement as an earnest of what it may be expected to do in the future A newspaper article has stated that, though at present a purely religious organi sation, the Arya Samaj may be forced, by Government distrust, to “ become a military organisation like the Sikhs A number of instances have occurred in which Arya Samaj speakers have attempted to undermine the loyalty of soldiers of the native army, and the society is undoubtedly making a special effort to proselytise the Sikhs, a similar attempt having already largely suc ceeded in the case of the Jats. among 17. 'ihe Pan*lslamic movement does not seem to have made much headway among Indian Mussulmans, though there have been several reports cf the arrival of emissaries of the society to preach their doctrines in India. The granting of a constitution in Persia and Turkey has, as might be expected, had a certain amount of disturbing effect, and has given the native press occasion for homilies on such texts as “ TV hat the people can do against their Govern ment ”, “ Independence ”, as in the case of Persia, “ cannot he won without bloodshed “ The power of the Army in politics ”, as exemplified by the Other Societies Arya Satnuj.

It is also asserted that the Amir is about to follow the example of the Sultan and grant his people a constitution, an idea very likely largely due to the fact that he has lately been drawing on Turkey for experts, military and otherwise. The Amir, indeed, is held up as a possible saviour of India, which is represented as “looking to him for orders, ” from the tyranny of foreigners : and the assertion is made that his conduct during his tour in India has made Hindus as well as Mussulmans anxious to welcome him as their ruler. Special leaflets have been addressed to the Mussulmans, urging them to unite with the Hindus, and newspaper articles have appeared detailing the various occasions when Europe, with England always as instigator, has shown itself antagonistic to Islam. There is a certain small body of Mussulmans, chief among whom is Haidar Eaza of Delhi, who preach unity with the Hindus, .and who seem to desire an outbreak, perhaps in the hope that in the wreckage following a successful revolution the Mussulmans might come to the top. 18. Deports have been received asserting that Singh Sabhas are largely Propaganda used as a cloak for anti-British propaganda among the Sikhs but. so far, enquiry 10 41 has not substantiated this statement : the special attempts which are undoubt edly being made to subvert the loyalty of the Sikhs as a class appear to come entirely from outside. The efforts of the Arya Samaj in this direction have already been alluded to, and a strong campaign to the same end in the vernacu* lar papers has been noticeable. The Yugantar published a particularly objectionable article on the Sikh 'War, urging the descendants of “ the victors of Chillianwala ” again “ to hunt the English from jungle to jungle like jackals and dogs/’ as their forefathers had done. Eor this article the paper was prosecuted. What is known as the “ Rawalpindi rape case ” in which a European was charged with raping a Sikh woman, who was afterwards falsely asserted to have com mitted suicide, was m:ule great use of in the native press: the Circular of Freedom, a vernacular paper published in San Erancisco, contained the translation of an article from the Yugantar into Gurmukhi which, being printed as a separate page while all the rest of the paper was in Urdu, was unmistakeahly intended for circulation as a leaflet among the Sikhs. The highly seditious pamphlet “ 0 Martyrs’* was sent to the students of the Khalsa College : Guru Nanak was asserted to have been reincarnated in Amritsar : a hook of Sikh prophecies, ascribed to Gum Gobind Singh, was printed and cir culated—some copies being said to have come into the hands of Sikh soldiers— in which the future greatness of the Sikhs and the downfall of the English are foretold. among 19. Prophecies of the end of British rule have been frequent—an insidious Prophecies, form of appeal to a superstitious people. In most of these, it is the Sikhs who are described as the successors of the British, whose rule is said to be only temporary. The limit given to the endurance of the British Baj varies from 2 to 10 years, and it is asserted that as British rule in India began on a Sunday and the Mutiny broke out on a Sunday, so it will end on a Sunday. Predic* tions have also been nuearthed from the “History of Arakan ” stating that “pieces of metal with sharp edges, though not of real copper, will be issued as l ather coins, coins, and that rupees made of leather will be used,’* The nickel one-anna piece is pointed to as the fulfilment of the first half of this prophecy, and there have been many rumours of the imminence of the second. In Indore, native hankers actually went to the Treasury to find out if it was true that a consign ment of leather rupees had been received there. These coins will be made, it is said, of the hide of pigs, cows and dogs, and will thus destroy the religion of both Hindus and Mussulmans. Taken in conjunction with the campaign against foreign sugar and salt, which are said to be refined with cows* and pigs 5 icase car rl(ge8 ‘ blood, it cannot be doubted but that au attempt is being made to get up a religious cry on the same lines as that of the “ greased cartridges at the time of the Mutiny. 20. The Hindu religion is certainly being used as a political lever. Temple Hindu religion as lectures are everywhere given and hymns sung, the trend of which is anti- »political lever. British : Gaoraksha (anti-kine-killing) societies are made a common platform on which men of all shades of political opinion may meet: the “ Gita is heldIndia, specially in the Punjab, has been most noticeable : loyal preachers have testified to their unpopularity where formerly they were well received, one goin^ so far as to say that where a few years ago there were perhaps ten per cent of people disloyal, now the percentage is at least fifty. England, which was once the first power, is now stated to he only the third : British power and prestige have declined, the days of British rule are numbered, and soon the Indians may come by their own. 24. The active Indian spirit of disloyalty has been ceaselessly fomented ^ait^nom^brota from abroad. The victory of Japan over Russia has produced a profound effect ° y&amp; 1 l ° m a r ° a on popular feeling all over Asia, and the presence of an abnormally large number of Japanese in India at the present moment—with what object, time Japan, alone can show, though their proceedings bear a disquieting resemblance to their actions in Manchuria before the Russo-Japanese war—is an undoubted incentive to Indian dreams of following in the footsteps of Japan. The United United states of States are believed by the agitators to be in sympathy with their aims, and Amenca - gome colour for this belief is to be found in the “ Letters to the Indian people” by M. H. Phelps, a New York lawyer, whose indictments of British rule in India are all the more telling, coming as they do from one who is apparently quite disinterested in the question, Indian lecturers have been touring in the United States and have apparently everywhere met with sympathetic audiences : while the stories about large consignments of arms, ammunition and explosives being imported into India, emanating from newspapers in America and Japan and widely reproduced in the vernacular press, have helped to swell the prevailing feeling of unrest. A number of Indians are said to have been IndlangabroatL despatched to Japan and Russia, to ask for help to free India from the British yoke : and the reforms which have lately been sketched out are believed to be due to the efforts of the “ deputation to the English people *’ which left India a few months ago, and to the choice which B. C. Pal was stated to he about to lay openly before the British public, between yielding to the demands of India and having to face a resolution. Articles have appeared in the papers ref erring to the “Central Bevolutionary Committee of India,” located in Paris, where a France, school for bombs is also said to be engaged, under Russian instructors, in teach ing Indians the manufacture and use of infernal machines. The “ Pacific Slope ” organisation is even better known to the reading public The Asiatic Tl . ansvaal question in the Transvaal has given rise to very great ill-feeiing, fanned by well-meaning but injudicious persons in England: British rule in Egypt has been Egypt, held up to obloquy by English and Egyptian publicists who have found an echo in the vernacular press of India, the “ Denshawi incident ” in particular having furnished a text, on grossly garbled premises, for denunciation of British violence and tyranny. It has been asserted, with considerable appearance of E «ssia plausibility, that Russian agents have been, and still are, most probably with- out the knowledge and even against the orders of their Government, working to try to foment a rising in India : a small point in favour of which assertion is the fact that the young Russian officer, Y. V. Lasseff, who visited India in 1906 and is believed to have arranged for a news agency in Lahore, has recently been writing to one of his Indian friends about an Urdu newspaper which he proposes to start, where it is not stated. 25. The most persistent efforts made to foster Indian agitation from out- Newp-tpcrg publish side are made by newspapers. Most of these are sheets published by Indians ed abroaa ' resident abroad, such as the Circular of Freedom already referred to, Free Hindustan, wbo^e activity in the “ Pacific Slope’* movement has been a frequent source of comment in the English press, and the Indian Sociologist « Indian sedoiegist.’ whose editor, S. K. Yarma, is one of the most rabid and outspoken of the antagonists of British rule in India in any shape or form. This paper openly preaches the doctrine of revolution and anarchism in India, and urges Indians to “ organise secret, combined and determined disaffection.” Its introduction into India is prohibited, but as it is a small sheet, capable of being enclosed in an envelope like an ordinary letter, and is allowed to continue publication in London entirely unchecked, it has continued, at any rate until lately, to reach its addressees with very little hindrance. Among foreign newspapers, the*' Justice.” ^ harmful many of the leditioas leaflets circulated reproduowl in i» Th. measures taken to prevent the entry of this paper into India have, however been more successful than in the case of the Indian Sociologist and an attempt to introduce it through the JFrench possessions in India is believed now to have been frustrated : however, stray numbers do no doubt still get through, and undoubtedly cuttings_ of the most virulent articles arrive in letter form, and these it is impossible to stop. . .. .. of di9 . 28. Of all the newspapers arriving in India from abroad, however, it must he loyaHv’from England, confessed that tlie most pernicious is one owned by an Jinglishman an in London, whose prohibition in India has been forbidden, so that there is nothing to prevent its dissemination in original and m the form of quotations in t e vernacular press. This paper is edited by the Socialist M. H. Hvndman. In it the British Government is described by such phrases as The mite Terror”, “the most loathsome vampire ever imagined by a distraught brain ”, “ hideous nightmare ”, “ hideous despotism *, while of the revolutionary movement in India the editor writes, in an article headed The w rating on the Wall ”, as followsThe Mutiny of 1857, though favoured by the more enlightened Indians as an opportunity of shaking themselves clear of the white terror, awakened no corresponding enthusiasm on the part of the mass or the population. If it had, we could never by any possibility have reconquered the country. But now things are very different.” Objectionable pamphlets^ by the same author have also been freely imported into India, one of which, “Unrest in India,” was lately found in circulation among students. Of the harm done in India by the tours of persons like Messrs. Keir Hardie and Nevinson and by the proceedings of Sir H. Cotton and his friends in larlia- ment, it is unnecessary to speak. TTnmt In the Native Army. Newspaper articles. 27. The preceding paragraphs refer to Unrest in India in general: it remains to speak of the special question which naturally most closely interests military enquiry, namely, how far it has spread to the Native Army. It is hardly possible in all cases to draw the line between unrest in the Native Army and that in India in general, as a persistent propaganda among the classes Irom which the men of the Mative Army are drawn must of necessity react to a greater or less extent upon the soldiers themselves. 28. Many newspaper articles of an objectionable nature have been specially addressed to sepoys. Thus, comparisons have been drawn between British and native soldiers, as to treatment, pay and rations, etc., and especially as to courage : it being pointed out that British troops are always kept in reserve on active service on the frontier, and native troops sent on in front to get killed. B emarks by sepoys themselves have been reported which show that this form of incitement to disaffection has ^occasionally, at any rate, fallen on fruitful ground. Offensive newspaper paragraphs have also appeared referring to “ British officers being put in a place of safety behind the rank and file ”. The Hindustan of Lahore points out that “ more than half^ of the army in India is made up of native soldiers, whose interests are identical with those of the revolutionaries, ” while several newspapers comment on the alleged refusal of native troops in Indo-China to take up arms against their countrymen, and draw the moral that, unless and until a similar spirit ani mates the Native Army in India, Indians cannot hope for success in their efforts for freedom. Special efforts have been made by the authorities to prevent soldiers from taking in seditious newspapers, with considerable apparent success: though the difficulty of preventing them from coming to a knowledge of the contents of newspapers at second hand or in a surreptitious manner is practically insurmountable. Leaflets, etc. 29. Leaflets have also been specially addressed to soldiers, some of which have already been noticed. Special attention has been devoted, chiefly apparently from the United. States, to getting such literature into the hands of soldiers in garrison outside India, notably in Hongkong. Postcards, emanating from Peshawar, have been circulated all along the frontier, urging soldiers tostrike, Lecturers have often made use of language specially intended to appeal speeche., to a military audience : as an example, lectures may be quoted in which stress has been laid on the valour of the Indian soldiers in the Loxer rising and the wonder of foieign soldiers that such warriors should still be content to remain in subjection to the English. The suggestion has also been made that soldiers should shoot their white officers, and thus serve their Motherland. 80. Efforts to tamper personally with the troops have been fairly fre- Efforts by meana quently reported. Wandering mendicants, and even ex-soldiers, have been ° f emi88arie8 ‘ found in regimental lines under suspicious circumstances, though it has never been found possible to obtain direct evidence of what they said or did there. Men going on leave to or from their homes, or visiting a city from cantonments, have been approached by the disloyal party: in railway trains and at railway stations the clerkly class have made the most of their oppor tunities for preaching sedition: attempts have been made to tamper with soldiers through the medium of the Hindu commissariat and transport con tractors, and of the numerous regimental clerks and Hospital Assistants who profess the tenets of the Ary a Samaj: special efforts have been made to disaffect the Sikhs by references to the glories of their ancient Eaj: the “ greased cartridge” story has been brought up again, and the suggestion made that Government is again trying to destroy the religion of its soldiers. Disquieting rumours have been deliberately started by the extremists, one for instance being Rumours, that a Sikh regiment in Cawnpore had refused to fire on rioters when ordered to do so, but had, on the contrary, fired on the Europeans, killing 50 of them. Emissaries have been sent out to tamper with the native troops abroad, e.g., the notorious H. L. Varma in Hongkong and North China. The Arya Samaj has Ar ya Samaj. been actively at work among the troops, a recent example having occurred at Jhansi where a number of soldiers attendeda lecture by an Ar.va Samaj speaker, at which some highly seditious language was indulged in. On this occasion, fortunately, the police were able to prosecute the lecturer and to get him punished: in which connection it may be noticed, as a disquieting fact, that though there can be no possible doubt of the existence of seditious propaganda in the Native Army, not only have soldiers practically never come forward spontaneously to report such attempts, but it has been found impossible to induce them to substantiate information derived from other sources. A special Recruiting, effort has also been made to dissuade men from enlisting, and this movement has been assisted by a very wide spread feeling of discontent among soldiers themselves, especially among the Sikhs, at the increased work now demanded from the soldier, the decline of 4 izzat ’, especially among the Native Officers, and the low standard of pay in the native ranks. The improved scale of pensions has, however, done a good deal to minimise the force of the latter complaint, and the new increase of pay ought to remove it altogether. 31. It is not to be expected that these persistent and widespread efforts Existence of dis. should in all cases have been fruitless. Besides the discontent with the terms ^ yalty in the Native of service just mentioned, a certain number of disloyal and seditious speeches Amy ’ on the part of native soldiers have been reported. These are largely due to per sistent rumours which, however devoid of foundation, undoubtedly find wide Rumour., credence in the Native Army, as to the disarmament of native regiments in 1907, and the posting of British sentries over their magazines. It is frequently stated that the distrust shown by Government last year will bear evil fruit in the future: that Government has shown that it will never again trust the Native Army in time of disturbance, and that the Native Army will repay this distrust by grudging service. Indeed, it has often been asserted that this was actually the case in the late expeditions on the frontier, where the men “ fought for the preservation of their own lives, but their hearts were not in the business.’* Another persistent rumour, which has also obtained wide credence, is that in the Mohmand expedition certain Gurkha regiments refused to go to the front unless they received equal pay and rations with the British troops, and that they were therefore kept in reserve and were not sent across the frontier. An attempt has been made, apparently with some success in places, to enlist the sympathy of Hindu native soldiers, including Sikhs and Dogras— the latter especially—with the “patriot” Tilak: and the “worthlessness”1B6 , n nprl «?o often into the ears of and cowardice of the Britfah X\ oubte d but that many are ready to nuiojai re»», k . the native rank and file that it cannot § as ,&lt; Eve ry native regiment U •»«»«. believe in their existence f “u nuld y lea Ve India,” “ Native regiments is heartily desirous that the Br ' , bad been ordered to do so would not have fired on rioters last year h y WO uld have been a and “ If even one native regiment had started rt, ^ yet 8uffioieutly mutiny in the Punjab last J e m, * o dou ^ k | g inconsiderable, number often reported to show that there &gt; t b t i, e f au lt of the of disaffected men among the native troops and '' • agitators if this number does not tend constantly to increase. 3!

This document is to be treated as a “SECRET” work, and will be kept in the personal custody of the official to whom it is issued or subsequently transferred, in accordance with the orders contained in King’s Regulations and the Official Secrets Act. 2. When an official to whom secret documents have been issued vacates his appointment, or is transferred, or is relieved of his duties for any period, the documents in his possession must be personally made over to his successor. 3. An officer to whom secret documents are issued will keep a list of such documents in his charge, which list will be compared when taking over the documents with the receipt form then signed. Any deficiency noticed then, as at any other time, should at once be reported, through the usual channel, to the Chief of the Staff and immediate steps be taken to trace the missing document and fix the responsibility for its loss. 4. Attention is directed to the letter reproduced opposite. Copy of a letter from the Adjutant General in India, to the Lieutenants-General Commanding, No. 654-A., “Officers—Discipline,” dated Fort William, the 17th March 1904. It has come to the notice of the Commander-in-Chief that notwithstanding the very clear and precise orders which have from time to time been issued to ensure the secrecy of documents, there have been instances recently where the most reprehensible laxity has been shown in the observance of those orders. 2. This laxity can obviously only have arisen from a want of adequate appreciation of the responsibility resting upon those to whose care these important secret documents have been entrusted, and in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future as to the serious nature of these responsibilities, the Commander- in-Chief wishes all concerned to be informed that he intends to take the severest notice of any future neglect of the orders. 3. Under His Excellency’s directions a copy of this letter will be attached to all documents, the secret nature of which may necessitate their being issued for the personal information of those concerned.PREFACE. It has been found desirable to restrict the issue of this Summary as much as possible, in view of the secret character of a considerable proportion of its contents, which makes it specially necessary that every precaution should be taken to prevent unauthorised persons obtaining access to it. A chapter on Unrest in India has been added this year. Simla; ^ W MALLESON, Colonel, &gt; Asst.

Political. The following reports were received during the year of the work of Russian Busaian reconnoitrers and agents in and towards Afghanistan :— Service. (a) In January information was received of the arrest and expulsion across the Oxus, under the orders of the Amir, of one Dassu, a Shikarpuri money lender from Bokhara reported to be a Russian spy. (b) In March news arrived from Kabul of the arrest, early in February, of two Russian spies in Afghan Turkistan. Towards the end of the same month three more men, reported to be Europeans, were arrested by the Afghan authorities near Sar-hpul. They were taken to Kabul where one of them is said to have died. (c) About the same time unconfirmed reports were received that a Russian named Zulakof had -been arrested at Herat, disguised as a mullah and with maps in his possession. (^) In the middle of March Saivid Earidun Shah, an important member of the Russian secret service in Afghanistan, arrived at Termez to report on matters in connection with his service of spies. Two of his secret agents are said to have accompanied the Amir of Afghanistan during his visit to India in 1906-07. (e) In the middle of April a Sarikoli, Saiyid Baba, a suspected Russian secret agent, arrived at Bombay from Zanzibar, and proceeded home via Nowshera and the Malakand. (/) In May it was reported from Yarkand that 2 mounted Russians had entered the Raskam valley from Sarikol and were exploring the roads to Ladakh. {g) In June Merv reported the despatch of a special agent via Panjdeh to report on the state of affairs at Kabul. (h) In July information was received from Kashgar that a Russian spy, named Bakhtiar, of Yangi-Hissar was travelling as a trader via Gilgit to Chitral. The man does not appear to have entered Chitral as no further information was received concerning him. {i) In mid-September 2 Russians were brought to Kandahar from Herat and were sent on to Kabul. With them were 5 Heratis who were alleged to have given them shelter. (y) Two men were reported to have been arrested by the Afghan author- . ities at Mazar-i-Sharif in October in suspicious circumstances and with incriminating documents in their possession. (&amp;) The Termez Political officer {vide next paragraph) left for Kulab at the end of November to see Saiyid Earidun Shah who, accom panied by 2,000 Hazara families, left Afghanistan at the time of Sardar Ishak Khan’s rebellion, and ever since has been active in obtaining Afghan intelligence for the Russians. At the end of July it was reported that a special Political officer of the Russian Diplomatic Service had been appointed at Termez, and had assumed charge of all the intelligence arrangements on the frontier and in Afghanistan. In addition to two special news-writers at Mazar-i-Sharif and one each at Tash- Kurghan, Kabul and in the Peshaw f ar District, he is said to have 12 travelling secret agents at his disposal for carrying out special reconnaissance work. He also has agents, who are all Sarts or Turkomans, posted at the following places in Russian or Bokharan territory, viz. :—Bosagha, AkKum, Kilif, Chush- ka Guzar, Slmrab, Airatun, Jini-Kul (? Jili-Kul), Sarai, Barkhaz, Kabadian, Kurghan Tyube, Deh Nau, Yurchi, Shirabad, one man being stationed at each of these places ; at Shahdalbaz and Hissar,two men each; and at Termez and in the Kulab (Kulyab) District, at different places, four men. It is stated that this newly appointed officer formerly served in the Trans-Caspian Sapper Battalion. Secret2 Russo- Afghan Relations. Russo-Bokharan Relations. The conciliatory attitude adopted by the Russians towards Ishak Khan, who at the invitation of the Governor-General visited Tashkent in 1907, has been the subject of several reports throughout the year. During the Zakka Khel and Mohmand Expeditions both the Sardar and other Afghan refugees at Samarkand were in high favour and were, it is said, frequently consulted on the situation in Afghanistan. In June a reception given by Ishak Khan was attend ed by all the leading civil and military officials in the city. The Governor of Samarkand, Lieutenant-General A. S. Galkin, utilised the occasion to emphasise in a speech the friendly relations existing between Russia and Afghanistan and hinted that, if the Sardar wished, his return to Afghanistan could be easily ar ranged. Ishak Khan, however, repudiated any desire to return to his own coun try, and stated that his one ambition now is to make the Mecca pilgrimage. Again in September Ishak Khan had a long interview with the Governor- General during the latter’s visit to Samarkand and was invited to visit him in Tashkent. He is reported to have excused himself on the grounds of ill-health. In September it was stated that Muhammad Sarwan Khan, late Wazir of the Governor-General of Balkh, who in the middle of December 1907 fled to Termez owing to defalcations in his accounts, had returned to Afghanistan. A subsequent report stated that he had been arrested and taken as a prisoner to Kabul. Two Afghan Hakims, Muhammad Hussain Khan of Mazar-i-Sharif and Mir Alam Khan of Afghan Wakhan, are reported to have fled into Russian terri tory in April and June respectively. jamshedi incursion. Eor incursion of Jamshedis into Russian territory vide page 4 under &lt;£ Afghanis tan.^ It appears from information from three independent sources that Mir Ahmad (or Alam), son of the late Amir of Bokhara, Mazaffar Khan (vide page 3 of the li)07 Summary), is generally known by the name of Mansur Khan. One report states that he was the sixth son of Muzaffar Khan, another that he was his youngest son. As, however, the late Amir had some 50 wives and many children it is practically impossible to verify either statement. All reports, however, agree as to Mansur Khan’s unpopularity in Bokhara owing to his having become thoroughly Russianised. He is reported to have remained at Bokhara only a few months and to have then been requested by the Amir to leave. During his stay at Bokhara he appears to have endeavoured to create a feeling of discontent among the Bokharan troops by contrasting their wretched accommodation, pay, clothing, training, etc., with that of the Russians. He is now residing at Moscow in receipt of an allowance from the Bokharan Treasury, in addition to that paid him by the Russian Government. Of the other sons of the late Amir the second son, Saiyid Abdul Malik Khan, died some years ago in India. The third son was formerly Governor of Cbarjui, but is said to be now in confinement in Bokhara, as are also four other brothers of the present Amir. Two other sons of Aluzaffar Khan, Saiyid Mir Akram and Saiyid Mir Alam, are Governors of Guzar and Karshi respectively. Russo-persian Re- Pages 15-18 of the 1907 Summary describe the measures taken by Russia lations - in that year to meet any critical situation that might arise out of the political ferment in Persia and the incursions of Turkey into that country. These measures consisted, apparently, of an increase of the forces in Caucasia by some 5 Battalions, the occupation of Astara, Lenkoran, Julfa and Chikishlyar by a total force of 5,000 infantry, 900 Cossacks, 24 Maxims and some field or mountain guns, reinforcement to a small extent of the garrisons of Tejen, Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun, and the stationing of 2 gun-boats at Ashurada whence frequent visits were paid to Astarabad and other Persian ports on the Caspian. At the beginning of 1908 rumours were frequent that the troops in the neighbourhood of the Azerbaijan frontier had been strengthened, more espe cially at Julfa where some 2,000 infantry were said to be. The latter state ment was contradicted by M. Isvolski wTio asserted that at this place were 6 squadrons of the Uman (Kuban) Cossacks only; they had arrived there in 1907. At the end of March special enquiries were instituted; from them itappears that the garrison of Astara was 50 cavalry and 30 infantry, all of the Frontier Guard or the Local Detachment, and that at Lenkoran were 1,000 infantry of the 262nd Kegiment, 200 Cossacks, and 60 gunners with 6 guns. The total force between Baku and the Persian frontier was put at 10,000 men and 34 guns, according to a probably much exaggerated estimate from the same source. Generally, it would seem that, except for a temporary move of the 2nd Trans-Caspian Battalion towards Bujnurdto nip an impend ing Turkoman outbreak in the bud, but little alteration had taken place in the situation of the Russian troops since 1907 up to the middle of April 1908. About this time the attention of the Russians was diverted to the state of affairs on the Moghan (Mugan) Frontier where the Kurds, under the influ ence of the rumours of impending hostilities between Turkey and Russia, became more than usually active. Further encouragement to disorders occurred towards the end of March when the officer in command of the Frontier Guard in this neighbourhood, Captain Dvoyeglazof, and 3 out of 4 of the Cossacks who formed his escort were killed in Persian territory, to which they had gone in search of a horse stolen by the Shahsevan tribe with whom that officer had a blood feud. The Russian Frontier Guard retaliated by attacking the Persian village of Byelasuvar or Talwish Mikeli, killing 40 of the inhabitants. Then followed a series of attacks by the Khoja-Beglintsi, Shahsevans (or Shahsevan- eltsi) and Avgar tribes, under Sardar Khan and Khan Mehmet Kuli Alar, on the Shirinsu, Ovcha, Bagnar-Taninski, Diman (Doman), Korshchukinski, and Burovar posts, all of which lie on the frontier between Kilvazi and Kovshutchi, a distance of some 45 miles. In the meantime reinforcements had been sent from Baku, and 200 men were sent into Persian territory in pursuit of the Shahse vans who suffered a loss of some 18 killed and wounded, but forced the Russians to retire with a loss of 6 killed and wounded. The situation now became so serious that not only was it decided to des patch a small expeditionary force from the Caucasus but troops were also moved from Turkistan, at least as far as Krasnovodsk, if not to Astara where, according to one account, 1,500 artillery and infantry arrived from Trans- Caspia in the month of April. The force from the Caucasus, viz .:—the 2nd and 4th Caucasian Rides, a sotnya of the Kuban Cossacks and 2 Q. F. guns, left Baku by sea on the 28th April for Astara, whence a march of 65 miles by a very bad post-road took them to Byelasuvar. The more direct route by Salyani and Prishib, nominally a post-road, was impracticable for it had been washed away by the River New Aris in 1896 and had not been repaired; moreover, on one stretch there was an entire dearth of water. The punitive expedition, which was under the command of General Snarski, appears to have attained its object in some 7-10 days, in which time several villages were destroyed; the Russians are said to have had some 28 casualties and the Kurds, out of a total of 1,000, lost 128 in all. By the middle of May order appears to have been restored on the frontier ; shortly afterwards the Persian Government paid some £5,500 as compensation ; and in the beginning of July the troops were back at their usual stations. The Russian papers urged that a rectification of the frontier was necessary, claiming that the Persian tribes had encroached on a strip of fertile land, about 75 by 1| miles, or 90 square miles in all, but the Russian Government does not appear to have pressed for terri torial compensation. As stated above, the Moghan incident involved the movement of troops from Turkistan to Krasnovodsk. At the end of April 600 infantry and artillery were moved westwards from Samarkand, and in May were followed by 1,300 more of these 2 arms from the same station, Tashkent, Termez, Askhabad and Merv; and it was also stated that both the reserve brigades were warned to be ready to mobilize. The bulk of these troops appear to have been moved to Chikisblyar where they could be equally well embarked for service against the Kurds or employed locally against the Yamuts on the Atrek frontier where, owing to a threatened outbreak, 400 infantry and 150 Cossacks had been sent at the end of April. It may be added that towards the end of May the presence of Russian field guns was reported at Ghatli, 16 miles from Chikishlyar. Early4 in June the troops began their return in small parties to their usual garrisons, but it was not till August that the 6th Mountain Battery was complete at Samarkand. In the middle of June the force at Chikishlyar had fallen to 1,000 from the 3,000 who had been there about a month earlier, and it would seem to have remained at the reduced strength for the remainder of the year. In July a report that requires confirmation put the number of infantry at Astara at 4 battalions. During the third quarter of the year no movement of troops of importance towards the Persian frontier occurred. Not impossibly the Jamshedi incursion confined the attentions of the Turkistan authorities to the direction of Kushk, vide p. 12. But at the end of October the garrison of Julfa was said to have been raised to 2 regiments of Cossacks, a statement which to some extent was con firmed by Sir E. Grey’s announcement on the 20th October that the Russian Government, in view of the dangers to which its subjects were exposed at Tabriz, had reinforced Julfa by 400 men who, however, were to cross the frontier only in the case of extreme urgency. Possibly at this time the garrison consisted of 1 6-squadron regiment and 2 other squadrons of Cossacks, 1 company of infantry and some frontier guards. As will be seen from the table on page 5 of “ Movements of Troops in Trans-Oaucasia to and from the Persian Frontier,” the force at Julfa was raised by the end of November to about 1,000 cavalry, 250 infantry and 140 artillery with 8 guns, besides some frontier guards. Anglo-Russian Re* latious In May, Baron Hey king on transfer from Newcastle*on-Tyne relieved M. Polovtsof as Russian Consul-General at Bombay. He left India in Nov ember to take up the appointment of Consul-General in London; during his short stay in the country he gave considerable attention to the develop ment of Russo*Indian trade. RuBso*Turkish Relations, Apparently it was on his initiative that in October the Imperial Government was asked by the Russian Ambassador to assent to the transfer of the Russian Con sulate-General from Bombay to Calcutta on the grounds that Russian trade interests had increased at the latter place and that it was a port of call for the Volunteer fleet. The Indian Government did not recognize the force of either argument, but in January 1909 the transfer was unconditionally approved by His Majesty’s Government who did not think it advisable to utilize the occasion for a renewal of our request to establish a Consulate at Tashkent. {Vide also tf Russo-Persian Relations,” page 2.) Early in the year many rum ours were current of the imminence of a Russo-Turkish war and it was reported from various sources that the 39th division had been, and 2 others were about to be, mobilised in the Caucasus. In consequence of the uneasiness which was creat ed by the prevalence of such reports, an official communique was published in St. Petersburg in which it was denied that any special military precautions had been taken on the Turkish or Persian frontiers. In February, however, M. Isvolski, Minister for Foreign Affairs, acknowledged to Sir Arthur fSicolson that the situation was causing him and the military authorities the gravest concern and that Russia was anxious to take no step which could be considered of a provocative character. The rumours of military preparations in the Cauca sus were, however, notwithstanding official denials, again revived a few days Jfter. Some colour was given to them by the visit to St. Petersburg of General £ 3 ri ^ ■^ ss ^ an ^ ^ le Viceroy of the Caucasus; the reported appointment ot Generals Bennenkampf and Zurabayef to high commands there; the sudden cessation of pilgrim traffic to Mecca from the Crimea, the Caucasus, and irans-Gaspia; the hasty^ replenishment of the more important fortified centres m the Caucasus with war material land supplies; the repairs to roads, mo ^.„ of A ere in : a ver y bad condidition, especially the Karabagh, or Imis-Ardubat-Ajestail, road; the discharge at Batum of some 900 tons of warlike stores; the preparations to suspend private goods traffic on the Vladikavkaz Railway ; the transfer of troops from European Russia to he Caucasus; and considerable increases of the garrisons near the Turkish frontier, especially at Igdar, Kagisman, Olti and Ordjoch. During March6 the situation irnproyed, hut disquieting reports again revived towards the middle oi April when a somewhat serious situation arose on the Moghan fron- tier* The subjoined table of the moyements of troops, new field and sie°-e ait! ery, and stores into Trans-Caucasia shows that the Russians took a oraye View or thfi STrnal.irm Ar&gt;r»ni«/Iin view of the situation.

The ordnance and stores embrace over 80 6-mck and S-mch guns, 24 other heavy guns, apparently sufficient Q F. guns to re-arm the field and mountain artillery, and telephone^ telegraph, field railway and pontoon equipment. * Moreover when in February all the 2nd Category Cossack re-iments that had been called out on account of internal disturbances were demobihVe l the measure d,d not extend to the 11 Kuban ard 4 Terek Cossack Regiments of that category m Trans-Caucasia. These regiments, however, were reduced from 4 and 0 to 3 and 4 sotnyas respectively; thus a total of 49 squadrons or some 7,500 men, are being retained above the normal peace establishment’ It may be noted that, possibly owing to the situation in Turkey and on th« Sfc&amp;i&amp;ar «• '.‘N'jVS-rsS 22^^ 181)8 Movements of Troops, Ordnance und Stores in Trans-Caucasia, other than those to the Perm Frontier, 5tli Jolj Number of j — —— — Date.

Comparisons have been drawn between the internal troubles of India and the Persian inroads on the Moghan frontier, and the suggestion made that Asia was being stirred up by Turkey to divert attention from the Macedonian question. The Russian authorities appear to have been uneasy on the subject, as in March it was reported that preparations were being made to disarm all Mussulmans in the Caucasus and Turkistan. The transfer of the administration of Turkistan from the War to the Home Ministry, reports of which began to circulate in 1906, has not yet been carried out There are, however, indications that a change in the Adminis tration of the country is contemplated. Py an Imperial Ukaz published in April, Senator Count Palen was appointed President of a Committee to visit Turkistan and report whether the present internal conditions of the country warranted the transfer of the administration to the Ministry of the Interior ; he was given powers to examine into all institutions except those of the established Church and of the troops, and also to bring to trial persons fonn 1 to have been guilty of breach of trust, etc. Special attention ’was to be paid to questions connected with colonization and irrigation, for which purpose experts on these subjects were appointed. Additional members were appointed in July, amongst whom were Major-General Mileanfc, who is the Officer in charge of Military Communications in the St. Petersburg Military District. Count Palen’s Com mittee arrived in Turkistan in Julv. . Its enquiries resulted in the discovery of a wide-spread system of extor tion in Trans-Caspia in which were concerned the Chief Secretary of the Prov ince, the Commissioners of Merv, Askhabad, Tejenand Krasnovodsk, the Samar kand Chief ol the police, the Talatan and Panjdeh Collectors and 8 others. . Bribery in connection with land settlements, irrigation, conversion of gov ernment labour, stores and taxes to private use, and the admission of foreigners and Jews into the province are chief amongst the offences of which these officials are accused. But in spite of the serious charges brought by Count Palen, tue Turkistan Government continues some of the officials in office. In April, too, orders were issued to the War Ministry to frame new laws for the Government of lurkistan and submit them to the Council of Ministers within two years. Meanwhile the regulations of 1890 remain in force. In October it was reported on the authority of the local press that the Ministry of the Interior had under consideration the question of the intro duction of local self-government in the Steppes and in Turkistan. The same sonice added in November that tne local governors were collecting information on the subject. Host-ration of I roni the list vInch is given below of the chief outrages which have Orde? in Turkistan. occuricd throughout the } ear it will be seen that little improvement in the internal condition of Turkistan occurred in the first 7 months. But in July, in which month General Mischenko took up the reins of government and the state of extraordinary protection, inaugurated in 1905, was renewed for another twelve months, crime began to lessen and the subsequent months of the year show a very marked improvement. To this state of affairs the follow ing measures lor the removal of revolutionary elements from the country appear to havemamly contributed : ~-(!) the expulsion of all Georgians from the Bokharan Khanate (2) the increase of the police and the creation in 1907 °f a special force of railway police throughout the empire, (3) the enlistment of special Turkoman levies. A further factor has been the discharge of a laige numhei of civilian railway empioyes, including many Armenians, the fr sia s SQ] ^ cts ; but this has been accompanied -vT 1 ’ 11 /urn ^ 3G ( tbe s P oraciic outbreaks of Turkomans that • * n l ''Y J! ^°i aken tlie -i° rm o£ organised pillage, more particularly m tlx last qunrier of the year Not improbably the lawlessness of Northern ema h as communicated itself to the Turkomans across the border. ht January 1908.' a goods train. -Two bombs exploded near Seirovo Station (Andijan Railway) underJanuary 1908. —Disturbances and murderous assaults by discontented railway men on railway police of frequent occurrence at Charjui.

October .—The existence of an organized system of horse-stealing in the Tashkent district was reported in this month ; so successful has it been that no horse has been recovered. The unsafe condition of the Merv-Tejen districts necessitated the employment of special Turkoman levies on the road from the latter place to Sarakhs. Repeated thefts of military stores were reported in this month on the Tashkent Railway. November. —In spite of the measures taken to maintain order near Merv and Tejen, mea sures which included the planting of a Baluch colony between Sarakhs and Tejen, vide page 11, several outrages occurred in November viz. :— {a) robbery of some wood-cutters between Tejen and Sarakhs by 15 Turkomans from Doshak; [b) robbery of 800 sheep about 10 miles from Sarakhs by 10 Turkomans ; (c) 50 camels carried off from Merv by, it was said, Afghans; {d) at Gumbarh, 30 miles from Sarakhs, two shepherds were killed and their flocks carried off .towards Tejen by Turkomans. In this month, too, an encounter took place near Gurmak in the Askhabad district between 17 Cossacks and some robbers, who were helped by a neighbouring village au( l escaped, after some firing, with the loss of 4i horses only. A more serious robbery occurred in the Bokharan Khanate where 50 merchants were attacked between Karshi and Bokhara by 60 robbers who carried off some £16,000 and killed one of the merchants. December. —Between Samarkand and Charjui the guard on each train was increased to 30 men owing to frequent attempts to hold up trains. 35 camels and 10 donkeys were carried off from Persian territory near Pul-i-Khatun. At the end of this month Count Palen’s committee is said to have ascertained that 250 employes of the Tashkent railway had banded themselves together for robbery. Five scouts were murdered near Atrek about mid-December and another on the frontier 16 miles from Sarakhs 10 dajs later. Besides the eastern portions of Turkistan, where the climate is suitable, the Bussians are making steady and continual efforts to colonise some of the hot and unhealthy frontier districts, notably Sarakhs, Kaahka, Kushk and Kerki. In January a colony of 20 Russian families was formed at Naoroza- bad on the Persian frontier, near Pul-i-Khatun. In February and again in March it was reported that 100 Russian families had settled at Alam Tepe near the Band-i-Sultan ; this settlement is referred to on page 7 of the 1907 Summary. In April some 2,000 peasants arrived at Tashkent and the majority were allotted land in the east of Turkistan. Sarakhs and Bosaga were said to have received 100 families in June; it is to be noted that according to earlier reports, there were already 200 Russian families in the vicinity of the former place. In September another 50 families proceeded to Band-i-Sultan and Panjdeh. In October several survey parties were at work in the Samarkand and Katta-Kurghan Districts, searching for fresh ground for colonization. In November was reported the existence of a new Russian colony of 100 peasants at Archingan on the Persian frontier where they have some 4 square miles of land, extending, it is said, into Persian territory. It was apparently to protect these colonists from attacks by the Persians of Daragez that a party of Russian troops was sent to this neighbourhood at the end of the month. About the same time a further batch of 30 Russian families left Charjui for Bosaga whica is the starting point of a projected canal {vide Irrigation).In 1902 some 200 Baluoli families under one Gul Muhammad Khan were settled in Persian territory on the Hari Bud above Pul-i-Khatun. Here they fought with both Persians and Russians over Water rights, but eventually became reconciled with the latter and moved to Ak-Chashma in Russian terri tory, giving their services as a frontier guard in return for land. In Novem ber 1908, they were transferred to more fertile land on the Hari Rud, half-way between Sarakhs and Tejen where they are to assist in suppressing the Turkoman robbers. Prom returns received in 1908 it appears that during 1907 there was a net gain of 12,000 colonists in Central Asia. It is worthy of note, however, that the Government’s colonization measures have been attended by but a quali fied success, for out of 20,600 colonists who arrived in Central Asia via Baku during the year 8,500 returned to Itussia. It is stated^ that the colony of Kazanski of 64 households and over 6,000 acres of land in the Kaplyan Sub district, is composed entirely of reservists and retired soldiers of the Turkistan Army. The former restrictions on the purchase of land in Bokharan territory bv Russian subjects appear to have been removed, for a Russian officer, Lieutenant-Colonel D. N. Logofet, has acquired a considerable property near Sarai which, it is said, will shortly become a Russian settlement.^ The removal of these restrictions will enable the Russians to take up land in the vicinity of Patta Kesar within the area of the Surkhan River Irrigation Scheme which, it is confidently hoped, will attract a large number of Russian emigrants, Amy. On na^e 7 of the 1907 Summary it was stated that the reports of movements variations in the of troops dmin- that year showed a net loss of some 3,400 men. It was added Turki.ta that this loss was probably to be explained by the non-arrival of recruits to replace time expired men. This suggestion finds confirmation m the similar reports for 1905 which show a net gain of 10,0u0 men. Thus the normal peace establishment of the 2 Turkistan Corps and of the troops in Semireohya, *.&lt;?., 68 000 men would seem to have been increased by 6,000 men in the 2 years. And this deduction finds some support in a rumour current in _ December that the garrisons of Turkistau were to be increased. But an analysis of the arrivals and departures in the last 3 months of 1908 show that the increase is merely a temporary one. The total of recruits who have arrived is nearly 2! ,600, while the number of time-expired men who have left is a little under 10,700 As in most units in Turkistan the men now serve for 3 years (Cossacks, 4 years), the annual contingent arriving and departing should be about 20,000 men. It would, thus, appear that all the recruits have arrived, but that only some halt of the time-expired men have taken their departure. During the^ piecedmg two years the opposite procedure was followed, for, partly to avoid distuibances by men kept over their time and partly to prevent the recruits coming unuej the influences of men impregnated with revolutionary ideas, the time-expired men were sent away before the whole of the recruits had arrived. Moreover, an increase in the annual contingent of recruits is natural since the reduction of the period of service from 5 to 3 years takes complete effect only with the contingent that is now joining. No permanent transfer of importance between garrisons has occurred, except, apparently, of some 400 Cossacks to Kushk from, possibly Petro- Alexandrovsk and Merv, vide infra Kushk. Under Kerki, too, it will be seen that the reinforcement of this fortress by a battalion and a machine-gun company is, it is rumoured, contemplated. Temporary movements in connec tion with the threatening attitude of Turkey and the disorders in lersia have already been described. It may he noted that the 4th and 6th batteries, the latter a mountain battery, of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps are normally stationed at Samarkand and proceed for the second 3 months of the year to Tashkent for the artillery camp at Troitskoye, returning in August in time for the Samarkand manoeuvres.12 But in 1908 the 6th Battery did not go to Tashkent as it was moved westwards owing to the state of affairs on the Moghan frontier. Kushk. In June new barracks were started at Kushk, but in November their con struction was stopped. In August, in consequence of the Jamshedi incursion into Russian terri tory, the troops of the Kushk garrison who had proceeded to Firyuza for train- i ig were hastily brought back to Kushk which was also reinforced between the end of August and mid-September by 700 infantry with 2 machine guns, 100 mounted infantry, 150 Taman Cossacks, and 300 of the Trans-Caspian Sapper Battalion, all from Merv, and by some 450 Cossacks from other stations, £ 1,700 in all. About the same time 70 of the Frontier Guard were sent to wards Maruchak, a battalion and 400 Cossacks towards Kara-Tappa, and 300 Cossacks to Panjdeh. It was stated that the Russians intended to permanently increase the Kushk Garrison, of some 3,400 men on a peace-footing, by 400 Cossacks, detaching 200 of them to Panjdeh. Up till 1908 Kushk has had no Cossacks. Some fear of Afghan retaliation for the outrages committed by the Jam- shedis appears to have arisen at Kushk, for not only were the walls of the works raised and wire-entanglements laid, but also strict rules were issued against the admittance of any Afghans into the fortress; these rules apparently were still in force at the end of the year. Kerki. There is every reason to believe that the report of the reduction of this garrison, on which some doubt was thrown in the 1907 Summary, was entirely without foundation, and that the importance of Kerki is more likely to be en hanced than diminished in the near future. In February the garrison consisted of 3,200 men ffiz,;—2 Infantry Battalions, 1 Regiment of Cossacks, 1 Mountain Battery, 1 Company of Fortress Artillery and a Section (289 men) of the Frontier Guard. It is known that large reserves of supplies, transport, am munition and engineer equipment are maintained there and a report arrived in June that new barracks for officers and men were in course of construction. These barracks, according to a report dated 3rd March, are to accommodate another infantry battalion and a machine gun company. Posts on the PamitB With few exceptions there appears to have been little variation in the kistan! ChlDe8e Tur ‘ distribution and strength of the Russian troops on and near the Pamirs and in Chinese Turkistan throughout the year. In April reports from two reliable sources stated that the Cossacks at Murghabi had been increased to 150. It appears, however, that the increase was only temporary and that the additional men had been sent from Karukh, possibly in connection with the reported construction of a new fort at the former place. The presence of Russian troops at Sarhad and Zung reported in 1907 has not been confirmed. In November it was rumoured that the Russian posts on the Oxus and Pamirs were to be reduced owing to the necessity of lessening expenditure. The strength of the posts has been approximately as follows :— ^4 .—Detachments on the Damirs. Station. Infantry. Cossacks. Guns. Remarks.

Training Generally .—Since his arrival in Turkistan General Mishchenko has devoted considerable attention to the efficiency and training of the troops of both the Turkistan Army Corps. He visited many of the garrison towns in Trans- Caspia during September and October and would have made a still more extended tour had he not been incapacitated by his wound. In August he was present at a camp of exercise which was held at Troitskoye and in a subsequent Army Order he severely criticised the action of all arms. The more important points to which he drew attention in this order were as follows. Ihe cavalry displayed a lamentable ignorance of the first principles of i econnaissance, and had a faulty appreciation of the value of dismounted action.^ The reports sent in were ambiguous and of little value in consequence. The principles of flank attacks were not understood.n * The chief fault the Governor-General had to find with the action of the artillery was its slowness of movement. Batteries were frequently observed to come into action at a walk. The general efficiency of the artillery, ow- ever, was highly commended and the condition of the horses left nothing to be desired. In the case of the infantry most of the General’s strictures were confined to the officers who appear to have laid few of the lessons of the late war to Troops were found to be generally unpractised in entrenching, and, although the proper use of ground was duly appreciated, formations were too dense, and wide intervals were left between detachments rendering the line liable to pene tration. The duties of infantry detailed as escort to artillery were not ap parently understood. Ranges were badly judged and the non-commissioned officers were ignorant of the methods of judging distance. The discipline and bearing of the troops on the whole earned the Governor-General’s approval. The improvement in the internal condition of Trans-Caspia and Turkistan has enabled \he training of the troops to be carried out on a much more extend ed scale than has been possible for several years. The artillery of the 2nd Army Corps, with the exception of No. 6 Mountain Battery, was concentrated in the neighbourhood of Askhabad about the beginning of June, and about the same time a portion of the garrison of Kushk was moved into camp. At the end of June the infantry brigade from Askhabad was in musketry camp at the foot of the hills between Gaodon and Askhabad. The troops remained under canvas all July, but in August the heat all over Trans-Caspia was so intense that military training had to be temporarily suspended. Towards the end of August training w r as again possible and on the I8th of that month the majority of the troops garrisoning Termez left for combined manoeuvres against the garrison of Kerki. From accounts received of the depar ture of these troops from Termez it appears that their mobility is not of a high order and their discipline indifferent. They are said to have taken four days to get off owing to transport difficulties and defective organization. The supply arrangements were in the hands of contractors, with apparently the exception of forage which was obtained on requisition from the Bokharan civil authorities. Maneeuvres were again held in the Askhabad district in September and were attended by General Mishchenko on whose life an attempt was made (vide p. 20). Machine guns .—The question of the employment of machine guns has been engaging the close attention of the military authorities in Turkistan, more particularly since General Mishchenko’s arrival. Perhaps to his initia tive may be ascribed the employment of these guns almost entirely with the mounted scouts of infantry regiments, according to reports of August from Sarakhs, Charjui, Termez and Tashkent. These mixed mounted detachments of scouts and machine guns appear to act independently of the battalion to wffiich they belong and have in some cases been amalgamated into mounted machine gun companies which work more with the artillery than with the infantry, with the result that the latter are deprived of both their scouts and their machine guns. It is to be noted that in 1906 a Russian Army Order disband ed the then existing divisional and brigade machine-gun companies, replacing them by regimental (or battalion) detachments of some 63 to 69 of all ranks. The machine gun companies in the case of the Termez and Merv garrisons ap pear to be of 8 guns and about 60 men. It would seem from a report re ceived from Samarkand in January that reserve as well as line battalions have been equipped with machine guns, although possibly the guns are only issued to the former for training purposes. The normal establishment is 2 guns in peace and 4 in w r ar per battalion, but the Turkistan battalions often train with 4 guns, probably as they are on a higher establishment of all ranks in peace. The Tarhistan Sapper Brigade .—Prom the report of the Inspector-General of Engineers, the Grand Duke Peter, on the inspection of the Turkistan Sapper Brigade it appears that the Trans-Caspian Sapper Battalion has a scout detach ment, although no provision is made for the formation of such a unit by the Army Order of 1886 on this subject. The Inspector General considers that such detachments, though contrary to regulation, are very useful forengineers in tlie case of particularly dangerous undertakings in which initiative, darino* and skill are as necessary as technical training. Other matters to which attention is drawn in this report are the insufficiency of the individual training of the rank and file; lack of efficiency in mining and other matters connected with fortification ; unsatisfactory performances of telegraph companies; want of energy in commanders; faulty performance of guard duties, drill and field traimno*; poor musketry results ; lack of supervision over interior economy by senior officers ; and indifference on the part of company commanders to the training of junior officers. The Tashkent Cadet Corps.—In February was authorised the foundation of two additional scholarships in the name of the Amir of Bokhara, who gave £2,200 for the purpose. A new departure was noticeable in the training of those cadets when in June a party of them left Tashkent for a month’s march through the District, carrying a soldier’s complete equipment. In the course of the march the Karajan Pass, 10,022 feet, had to be crossed. Training Manuals. —An important change in the system of signalling has been made by Army Order 79 which substitutes the Morse for the semaphore. This order lays down that the Morse system is to be learnt by all regimental officers, non-commissioned officers, instructional detachments for the training of non-commissioned officers, scout, mounted sappers, mounted orderly and artillery reconnoitring detachments, and also by 8 men per company, squadron or sotnya, and battery. Army Order 282 introduces a new {c Table of Infantry Bugle Calls and Marches.” Since the war a mass of contradictory theories on the tactics of all arms has been current in Uusua, and the training of the army has suffered both for this reason as also from the lack of definite principles which General Officers Commanding Military Districts have been unable to establish, in spite ot numerous and lengthy orders issued on the subject, bo far as the infantry is concerned, the defect has been removed in part by the issue during the year of “ Regulations for the Field Training of Infantry(Army Order 222) and Field Engineering Instructions for Infantry ”, Parts I and II (Army Order 290). The first of these manuals was submitted to trial at many of the summer camps in 1907. It deals with the training of infantry in the field, as its title suggests, and is to be supplemented by another part which will be con fined to drill and the more formal portion of an infantryman’s training. It; is a marked improvement on its predecessor of 1900 in the encouragement which it gives to iuitiative and the cultivation of the sense of responsibility. The new Manual of Engineering which supersedes Instructions of 1891 is confined to the instruction that is necessary to he given to privates (I art I) and to non-commissioned officer’s (Part II); it is to be supplemented by 1 art III which will contain the information that is necessary for an infantry officer. Training of officers. —With a view to develop the initiative of subaltern officers new rules have been introduced by Army Order 355. They prohibit the frequent transfer of officers in the junior ranks that has been, common in the past; require officers to return to regimental duties for a period of one year at least on vacation of an extra regimental appointment ; subject them to an examination within 6 months of their return ; and direct that subaltern officers are to be placed in effective charge of portions of their companies, etc. With the same object the interference of officers in &lt;ffie work of their juniors and the practice of juniors referring to their seniors for explanations in matters within their power to decide have been restricted by Army Order 511 which directs further that the Committee for the Training of the Troops is to work out regulations that will contribute to the development of the sense of responsibility. Instruction of all ranks. —In 1907 was introduced the practice of attach ing officers and the rank and file of infantry units in considerable numbers to sapper brigades for instruction in field engineering. The experiment has been renewed by ,A r my Order 47 in 1908 and is to be still further continued.16 Ordnar.ce equipment. In 1907, with a view to providing a sufficient number of non-commissioned officers, was made the experiment of allowing soldiers in their first year of service to join in March the instructional detachments that exist in each regiment for the training of non-commissioned officers. The experiment has been so suc cessful that from the 1st March 1909 the number of such soldiers has been raised from 25 to 50 per cent, of the whole class. It is instructive of the present tendencies of the training of the special infantry reconnoitrers that Army Order 182 alters the title of the detachments of these men from Hunting *’ to “ Scout Detachments and No arrivals of field or siege guns have been reported during the year. On the other hand in August 56 old pattern field guns, ie» enough for 8 bat teries, passed through Orenburg for the Obukhof works from, it was said, Vyerni, but more probably from other stations as well, for in Semirechya there are but 2 batteries. Again the time-expired men of the 2nd Orenburg Cossack Heavy Artillery Dattery when passing through Orenburg in December, were accompanied by 8 field guns. It would thus seem that the old pattern guns are being removed from Central Asia, and that the Cossack batteries there are being, or have been, re-armed with the new Q. E, gun. Of Maxims 32 were reported to have been sent to Tashkent at the end of December 1907 and to have been followed by 10 more in the next month. As, on the conversion of divisional and brigade machine gun companies into regimental or battalion detachments which was enacted by an Army Order at the end of 1906, there were sufficient guns in Turkistan for the formation of the detach ments of all the regular battalions, it would appear that the 32 Maxims were sufficient to provide 2 guns for each of the field reserve battalions that would be formed on mobilization, and not improbably the remaining 10 are an instalment to complete to the 64, at 4 per battalion, which these reserve battalions would have in war. The Army Order just quoted lays down that reserve battations, if independent as those in Turkistan are, should have a detachment. That the for mation of these detachments is in progress, if not completed, is indicated by reports from Merv of September 1908 to the effect that the reserve battalion there had 4 guns. In connection with these guns it is of interest to note that, according to Staff Circular 188 of 1908, the Maxims in possession of the Russian troops come from 3 different factories, with the result that all their parts are not inter changeable. This Staff Circular, therefore, directs that important repairs to the breech mechanism are not to be carried out locally, but that the guns are to he sent to the Tula Small Arm Factory for the purpose. It is, consequently, to be expected that the transport of these guns to and from Central Asia will be more frequent in future. By Army Order 216 of 1908 the 3-line (*299) dragoon carbine, carried by the men of machine-gun detachments, is to be replaced.by the gendamerie carbine of the same bore and dagger. The gendarmerie carbine is known also as Colonel Yurlof’s and was introduced in 1907. In November it was reported that the Tashkent arsenal had been consider ably extended, and the workshops and the employes increased. It was added that it was probable that both gun and small arm ammunition was being manu factured there, a statement that must be accepted with reserve. Army Order No. 398 of 1908 increased the entrenching tools of each com pany of field, reserve and fortress infantry from 80 small shovels and 20 axes to 140 small shovels, 30 small picks and 30 small axes, thus providing each man, except the non-commissioned officers, with an entrenching tool. The small pick is of a new pattern which was introduced by Army Order 391 of 1908; it is 21bs. 3 oz. in weight, without its case which adds another 14-| oz, and has a head and handle 3J and 24J- inches long respectively. At the same time the number of entrenching tools in depot battalions was raised to that of double the establishment of the rank and file, exclusive of the permanent staff, and it was recommended that the proportion of the tools which are all of the small pattern should be 70 per cent, of shovels, and 15 per cent, each of axes and picks.Signal rockets appear to have been retained as part of the equipment of field artillery and parks (ammunition columns) up to this year when by Army Order 220 they were abolished for all hut fortress artillery. Army Order 11, in amendment of 197 of 1901, fixes the establishment Adminlsf . rtttio of non-commissioned officers per squadron and company at 1 Sergeant-Major to each, 1 senior non-commissioned officer per troop or section, and 10 junior non-commissioned officers per squadron or company, making normally a total of 15 non-commissioned officers. Army Order 95 changes the names of the Sir Darya and Ferghana recruit ing districts, into the Tashkent and Skobelef respectively. Army Order 468 introduces new regulations for the mobilization of reservists* The chief feature is the substitution of public notices of recall in place of the notices which, were formerly addressed and handed to each individual reser vist. It is hoped by this change to accelerate the procedure of mobilization which, however, must still be slow, as compared with the Western Powers, owing to the defective communication by rail, road and telegraph throughout Pussia. The greater portion of the work connected with the calling out of reservists rests, as heretofore, with the civil and police authorities, while that of their reception and distribution to units devolves on ttie commanders of recruiting districts, or “ Voyenniye Nachalniki”. An important change in the administration in peace of regimental hospitals, including those which are on a higher establishment than the normal of 84 beds, has been made by Army Order 51 wTiich transfers the entire charge of the hospital, subject to the supervision of the Commanding Officer, to the senior regimental officer who was formally responsible for the professional charge only. Thereby a combatant officer, the “supervisor of ^ the regimental hospital ” is restored to his proper sphere, while also the officer in charge of the regimental administration is relieved of some of his work. To assist the medical officer in his administrative work he is to be given a hospital assistant ranking as an official. The change brings the peace system into harmony with that which has existed since 1888 for war. In nearly every military district a special committee is considering the dis continuance or reduction of such duties as those of town guards required by the civil authorities, and of orderlies and messengers. The report that Lieutenant-General Kartsef, Commanding the 2nd Turkis- Appointment*, tan Army Corps, who retired in December 1907, was to be succeeded^ by Lieu tenant-General Tikhmenyef proved to be incorrect, as in March Lieutenant- General M. D. Yevreinef, from the Caucasian Grenadier Division, assumed command. During the interregnum Major-General Shatilof commanded the Army Corps with Major-General Voikovnikof as Chief of the Staff. Lieuten ant-General Yevreinof, p. s. c., has had a wude experience of Turkis- tan, having served there on the Staff continuously since 1879, with the exception of 7 years (1889-96) during which he was employed in the Asiatic Section at Army Head Quarters and as Chief of the Staff of the 84th and 80th Infantry Divisions. From November 1904 to April 1903 he w r as Chief of the Staff of the Turkistan Military District. In March General Grodekof was relieved from the post of Governor-Gen eral of Turkistan, nominally on account of ill health, but a more likely reason appears to be his failure to restore discipline in the army or law and order in the towns of Turkistan. It was reported from more than one source that General Kuropatkin would succeed him and his appointment would have been exceedingly popular both with Russians and natives in Turkistan. 11 is atti tude at the Stoessel Court Martial, however, appears to have brought him into disfavour and in May it was announced that the Governor-Generalship had been given to General Mishcbenko. He arrived at Tashkent on the lltb July. Of Caucasian extraction, Lieutenant-General Mishchenko began his career as an artillery officer and has bad some experience in handling that arm. Subse quently he commanded a section of the Frontier Guard and there became acquainted with the employment of infantry and mounted infantry. Dur ing the w ar in Manchuria he displayed energy, skill and dash in handling a small mixed command of cavalry. He did not, however, subsequently18 pnve evidence of the possession of those higher qualities necessary for the com mand of a larger force. He is 55 years of age, has 39 years’ service and is reported to he still active and well-preserved. The slowness of his promotion may be explained by the lack of a Staff College certificate. Nothing is known of his administrative qualifications, but it may be noted, in view of the state of Turkistan, that General Mishchenko played a very active role in the suppres sion of the Revolutionary disorders in Moscow in December 1905, and, as will be seen from pages 9—Hand 20, he appears to have been exceptionally successful in the restoration of order in Turkistan. Major-General Semyenof was appointed to the command of the 6th Turkis tan Rifle Brigade (Askhabad) in February. General Semyenof was a close and constant adviser of General Kondratenko during the siege of Port Arthur and is described as one of its most distinguished defenders. He died very suddenly on the 7th September at Askhabad. During February also, Colonel Mitofan of, commanding the Kushk Fortress Artillery, and Colonel Lepekhin, commanding the 2nd Turkistan Rifle Battalion, retired on account of ill health. The latter has been succeeded by Colonel Omyelyanovich who has held various appointments on the Staff and served in the Russo-Turkrsh war of 1877-78. In April Colonel Smirnitski, Corps Intendant of the 16th Army Corps, was appointed Assistant to the District Intendant of the Turkistan Military District. In May Colonel A A. Yemelyanof, p.s.c.) who has not previously served in Turkistan, was promoted from the 134th Regiment to Major-General and appointed to the Staff of the Turkistan Military District. He has held various appointments on the Staff and served in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. Major-General Dushkevich, who commanded the 1st Brigade, 3rd Siberian Infantry Division, during the Russo-Japanese war but has not previously served in Central Asia, was appointed in July to the command of the 1st Turkistan Reserve Brigade (Tashkent) vice Major-General Yunicb. In August he tvas transferred to the command of 1st Turkistan Rifle Brigade. In October Lieutenant General Y. I. Pokotelo , Governor of Ferghana, was transferred to the Governorship of the Ural Province. In the same month the command of the Kushk Railway Company fell vacant owing to the retire ment of Lieutenant-Colonel Linyevski, and was given to Lieutenant-Colonel P. N. Rozlyaninof of the 1st 1 ranscasp'an Railway Battalion. Lieutenant- Colonel Kozlyaninof, who is 40 yeais of age and has 21 years’ service, took part in the China operations of 1900-01 and in the Russo-Japanese War and has graduated at the Nikolayevsk Engineering Academy. fn December Major-General M. A. Folbaum, Governor of Baku Town, was transferred to the Semirechya Province as Governor and General Officer Commanding. He belongs to the General Staff, has no war service, and was on the staff of the Turkistan District from January 1897 to September 1901, since when lie has served on the Staff, and as a regimental commander in European Russia and the Caucasus. 1 In December Major-General N. P. Gryaznof was transferred from cora- mancl of the 1st Brigade of the fcth Division to that of the 7th Turkistan Rifle Brigade. Elis previous service has mainly been in Siberia ; he took- part in de r&gt; of Port Artbur where 116 commanded the 15th Eastern Siberia Rifle Regiment. The appointments of General Officer Commanding the Trans-Baikal, and Irans-Caucasian Cossack and the Ussuri Horse Brigades, by Army Order 186 are to be held for the future by Major-Generals, the rank which at i he time of the issue of the order w r as held by une of the commanders of each of these brigades. An important change in the higher administration of the ararr was made bv Army Order 511 which places the Chief of the General Staff under the WarMinister. The former appointment was cr ated in 1905 when the General Staff became a braneh of Army Headquarters independent of the War Ministry* This experiment has proved a failure, arid for some time the Russian Press has been demanding a more centralized system of army administration, suggesting, in addition to the measure described as taken above, a limitation of the powers of the Inspectors-General of the different arms and of the General Officers Com- manding*in-Chief Military Districts. The failure of the system, so far as the independence of the Chief of the General Staff is concerned, is to be explained to a large extent by the constant friction between the War Minister and that officer, General Palitsin, who appears to have been inferior in energy, ability and character to the War Minister. Palitsin was transferred to the Council of State Defence in November, being succeeded by General ^. A, bukhomlmot, then Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Kief District. It is interesting to note that in August the Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholavevich, General Palitsin’s strong supporter against the War Minister, was deprived of the post of President of the Council of State Defence, whm r ow devolves on the senior member. The Grand Duke, however, was lert m his post of Commander-in-Chief of the St. Petersburg District. Vide also“ Restoration of Order in Turkistan'’on pages 9-11. No armed improvement mutinies on a large scale occurred during 1903, and a distinct improvement in discipline and moral is noticeable. Por instance, the time-expired men from eacn c-arrison were conveyed by special train in large bodies at the end of 1903, whereas m the preceding three years they were despatched m small parties for fear ot not and outrage The improvement, except for the isolated attempt on the lite ot the Governor-General, was most marked in the last live months of the year. But in the first seven months the state of discipline was still far from sati^ac- torv and the disaffection so noticeable in recent years had by no means died out. More than one Corps or District order was published ammadvert- in°’ on the negligence of escorts and the general slackness of guards and sentries Por instance, in April Lieutenant-General Kondratovich, who was officiating as Governor-General, drew attention to this matter m a strongly worded order which had special reference to the attack on the Charjui Treasury on the 8th March {vide page 10). He attributed the state of things to the rottenness of the training and severely censured the officers commanding the regiment and company concerned ; non-commissioned officers were de graded,^ the companies furnishing the guard were disbanded, and the men dis tributed among other battalions of the Brigade. In January the Askhabad magazine was twice broken into and 250 rides were stolen In February 60 men of the 1st Railway Battalion were arrested on suspicion of being implicated in this affair. During the same month a fracas occurred between Cossacks and Artillerymen at Kaahka m which 4 Cossacks and 5 Artillerymen were wounded. Two Colonels were reported in March to have been arrested at Samarkand, one for fraud and the other for making a seditious speech at a public meeting. On the 7th of June a mutiny occurred in the 11th r i urkistan Ride Bat talion at Andijan. The men refused to carry out what they considered was an illegal order, viz. :—to do a fatigue on a holiday, and forty eight of them were placed in confinement. In July a mutinous spirit was reported at Termez due, it was said, to the troops beino 1 overworked. About the same time the General Officer Commanding 2nd Turkistan Army Corps, called attention in orders to the increasing number of acts of violence towards non-commissioned officers. On the 5th October General Mishchenko, Governor-General of Turkistan, was wounded, though not seriously, by some men of the Railway Battalion who fired at him during manoeuvres near Askhabad. One sergeant-major and 39 men were being tried in October for the crime. It was amongst the engineer and railway troops, both largely drawn from the artisan class which has been most prone to revolutionary influences, that the want of discipline and mutinies were most noticeable in 1906, in which year it was found necessary to disarm the Turkistan Sapper Battalion for 6 months.20 la December were reported the loss of 25 rifles from the Tashkent Maga- Itussian Central Asia have been reported during the year 1908. In November an authoritative source was enabled to test the average load carried by these carts on a 42 miles journey, which was covered in two days, and found it to exceed 1,200 lbs , instead of the normal 720-900 lbs. It is said that on service each to each company as follows:—1 Samovar cart, 1 travelling kitchen, 1 S. A. A. cart, 1 Ambulance cart and 5 baggage carts in addition to 4 carts per battalion for forage, fuel, etc. A sotnya of Cossacks would have 10 carts and a battery of artillery 15. New establishments, both peace and war, of transport, *.&lt;?., of drivers, horses and vehicles, were introduced by Army Order 442 for all regular and reserve sapper battalions and engineer held parks, except those in Siberia, and also for the Turkistan Military Telegraph Company, with the proviso that for the sapper battalions in Turkistan and Trans-Caspia the peace establishment of drivers is to be maintained at the then existing figures, as laid down inlArmy Orders 309 of 1898 and 197 of 1900. New war establishments of transport were also introduced by Army Orders 458 and 459 for Pontoon Battalions and the 1st and 2nd Siege Parks, respectively. By Army Order No. 314 of the 22nd July 1908 all intendance vehicles are in future to he painted greenish grey instead of the present dark o&gt; re ea colour. This so called ‘‘protective ” colour, evolved by a Committee of Artil lery-Officers, has been adopted for field uniform, guns, wagons and all engineer equipment. Brown leather harness has also been introduced instead of black. Staff Circulars, Nos, 128 and 139 of 1908 announced the dosing of the magazines at Balvhti, Katta-Kurghan, Kokand, Namangan, Pishpek, Przhe- valsk and Sergiopol in June and July. made the occasion in the Eusski Invalid and the Turkistan Press lor reviews, the results wffiich the course lias attained and for proposals for reforms It appears that, owing to the difficulty of finding suitable employment for officers who qualify at the final examination, many of them seek civil employment and are lost to the Army, and that there is little inducement for those who remain to keep up their knowledge. Tne proposed reforms embrace the grant of a gratuity of a year’s pay, extra leave and a monthly allow ance to successful candidates; the introduction of an entrance examination to the solmnl tn Transport and Sup plies. zine and the arrest of an officer at Merv for selling 2 rifles to an Armenian. Further arrivals of the new pattern 1-horse, 2-wheeled transport carts in battalion would have allotted to it 45 of these carts which would be distributed Oriental languages.

Accidents. —Interruptions to traffic on the Central Asian Railway have The Central again been frequent throughout the year. As in 1907, heavy rain and floods Ra51wa y* have been mainly responsible for the irregularity of the traffic, although a number of so-called “accidents” have undoubtedly been caused wilfully by disaffected railway employes. The line was totally interrupted for over a week in August near Jebel and Kazan] ik, by two serious breaches caused by floods. Near the latter place about half-a-mile of the line was entirely washed out, the ballast swept away, sleepers displaced and the rails badly bent. Altogether more than four miles of the line were more or less seriously wrecked. Goods traffic between Krasnovodsk and Askhabad was accordingly suspended for several weeks and mail and passenger trains could proceed only at a very slow pace. The following is a list of other serious accidents and interruptions which occurred during the year:— January. —Total interruption of traffic for 12 hours owing to the subsidence of the railway embankment near Baitam Ali. , Line washed away and traffic suspended between Dushak and Merv. Accident to a sroods train near Artik, causing considerable dislocation to the traffic on this section of the line. February. —Suspension of traffic for 24 hours owing to floods near Bair am Aii. Collision at Kat'a-Kur^han station between a passenger and goods train. Shunting accident at Tashkent station. A goods train derailed near Kaufmanskaya and the mail train delayed until the next day. March. —Collision between two passenger trains between Merv and Bairam Ali. The conductors of both trains were placed under arrest. Collision between two goods trains at Ziadin station. Nine trucks wrecked. April .—Line washed away by floods near Tejen ; hence it will be seen that the measures taken in 1907 to prevent a recurrence of the serious interruptions which occurred in that year at this point have so far not been crowned witb success. June —A train derailed at Sultan Band and the permanent way damaged. Derailment of a train near Askhabad. Traffic interrupted by floods, which extended for several miles, near fuzil Arvat. About 700 yards of the railway embankment washed away between Restovtsevo and Kuropatkmo. July. —A train derailed near Seirovo, (8£ miles east of Kokand.) Shunting accidents at Merv and Chernayevo, in both cases attended with loss of rolling stock. Bridge near Kara Tenjir station, about 30 miles from Krasnovodsk, burnt and line temporarily interrupted. Collision at Uzun-Su and Askhabad, resulting in the destruction of seven wagons. September. —A collision ontkeKushk line. A mail train derailed near Kaufmanskaya station, and another between Katta-Kurghan and Nagornaya. October. —The embankment between Merv and Bairam Ali was reported to have been eroded to biich an extent by the irrigation works at th^ Inter pNce that it and the briuge near the neighbouring village of tie kTepe were in danger of collapsing. November. —A temporary interruption of traffic, caused by the burning of a railway bridge near Merv. A c dlision at Dushak between two goods trains, result ing in the destruction of 8 wagons and 2 cisterns Rolling Mock. — It appears not improbable that a portion of the 800 goods wagons, which are reported to have been temporarily added to the rolling stock of the Tashkent line, have been transferred from the Central Asian Railway. Since tne completion of the former line a very la* ge proportion of the goods traffic, especially the cotton export trade, has gravitated towards theTashkent- Orenburg route which affords both cheaper and more rapid transit to Moscow, the centre of the cotton manufacturing industry in Russia. The foregoing de duction is borne out by the report of the working of the Central Asinn Railway for 1907 in which it is remarked that this railway found no difficulty in dealing■ mm 22 with the goods traffic, notwithstanding the fact that the rolling stock available was considerably less than in former years. The condition of the engines shows little improvement, according to a local paper, for in March an engineer, who was specially deputed from St. Petersburg to report on the rolling-stock of certain railways, found the engines on the Central Asian Railway in so unsatisfactory a condition that a large number had to be withdrawn for repairs. In July it was reported that 200 oil-tank wagons were to be transferred from the Vladikavkaz to the Central Asian Railway. No report has, however, been received of their arrival at Krasnovodsk. Tn December orders were given for the increase of the engines and other rolling stock both on this line and on the Tashkent railway by transfers from other lines. Improvements .—The importation into Trans-Caspia of large quantities of railway material, which was a noteworthy feature of the latter half of j 907, has continued throughout the year under review. On the 26th January a steamer arrived with a cargo of rails and sleepers which, were said to be intend ed for the rumoured branch line to Cheleken {vide p. 25). On the 5th February a second steamer discharged a large amount of railway material of all kinds, some of which was stacked with the above-mentioned consignment for the mooted railway to Cheleken while the remainder was sent off eastwards. A third steamer arrived on the 20th February with a similar cargo and on the 2nd March four truck loads were despatched to the east. A lull then followed until the middle of July when in the course of a fortnight Gve steamers came into Krasnovodsk and discharged quantities of rails, sleepers and other railway material. A very large proportion of the rails, sleepers, etc., appears to have been despatched eastwards, as the following table shows :— Truck iOAns. Date of despatch from Remarks. Krasuovodsk. Bails.

Total 42 259 48 4 The purpose of these large consignments of railway material, which accord ing to a Krasnovodsk report of December, are to he followed in 1909 by further large consignments from Astrakhan in sailing vessels, still remains unex plained. All reports go to prove that no fresh railway construction is bein&lt;* undertaken either in Trans-Caspia or in Turkistan except the lines to Kshtutand Namangan ; vide pnge 25 ; and it is almost certain that a large proportion of the material is being utilised for the general repair of the Central Asian and Merv-Kushk lines which have suffered considerable damage in both 1907 and 1908 from floods. In February it was reported from several sources that considerable quantities of railway material were being stacked along the latter railway and that it was intended to begin construction of the Panjdeh- Kerki line at an early date. It was stated that only the necessity of employing all the engineers and sappers to cope with the serious situation created by the threatened bursting of the dams oi the Murghab irrigation works prevented the line being taken in hand at once. Subsequent investigations, however, show that, although the line has been pegged out, no immediate construction is contemplated. It is to be noted, loo, that out of a total of Soft trunks that, left Krasnovodsk, only 51 trucks with sleepers and 18 with rails were reported to have left 'Merv for Kusbk, a quantity which would be quite insufficient for the construction of a line such as that from Panjdeh to Kerki. It is possible, as mentioned on page 21 of the 1907 Summary, tnat, in addition to the general repairs, fresh passing places have been inserted on the Merv-Kushk branch, but so far no information confirmatory of this suggestion has been received. Management .—The report given in the 1906 Summary that a part of the Tashkent line was to be brought under the administration of the Central Asian Railway has not been confirmed. In July, however, it was announced in the local press that the Council of the latter railway had recommended the amalga mation of the Central Asian and Tashkent railways under one administration and the formation of a third railway battalion for Tashkent. This report was followed a few weeks later by the announcement that from the 1st of January 1909 the complete control of the Central Asian and Tashkent railways will be delegated to Tashkent and that the practice now in vogue of referring every thing to St. Petersburg will cease. This seems to confirm the hint, given by the Minister of Ways and Communications during his visit to Askhabad in July 1907, of the amalgamation of the two lines into one with a view to the reduction of the expenses of management. In Ibis connection it is of interest to note that the profits earned by the Central Asian and Tashkent lines in 1907 are stated to have been £191,260 and £81,200 respectively. Tratfic .—From statistics given by the Trans-Caspian Review it appears that the traffic returns on the Central Asian railway for 1906-1907 were as follows :— Year. Working expenses. Earnings. Surplus (+) or deficiency (—) Passengers. Goods, Tons. 1S05 ... £ 1,482,600 £ 1,684 600 £ + 202,000 P ? 1907 ... 3,457,300 1,650,300 +193,000 1,683,000 861,700 1908 ... ... ... ... • •• ... Decrease of 1307 compared with 1906 25,303 84,300 9,000 ... • •• „ „ 1908 „ „ 1907 ... ... ... ... ... Hallway Troops .—In 1907 the newspapers of Turkistan gave currency to the statement that it was under consideration to withdraw the railway batta lions from the main lines and that only the Merv-Kushk and Firyuza Blanches would he under military control. But in 1908 reports have been received which indicate that the pendulum has been swinging in exactly the opposite direction and that some hundreds of civilian railway employes on the main line have been discharged and been replaced by soldiers. In this connection, vide supra under “ Management ” and infra under “ Railway Employes. 1 * Railway Employes .—At the beginning of 1908 there were 5.726 employes on the Central Asian Railway. Of these 4,606 were Russians, 2i0 Poles, 527 Persians and Tartars* 136 Tekkes, 23 Armenians and 24 Georgians. The most striking feature of these figures is the small number of Armenians, yet they possess more brains and business capacity than any race in Central Asia, and form a large proportion of the traders in Russian Turkistan. This removal of the Armenians, the most revolutionary element in Russia, fiom employment on24 The Railway. the Central Asian Railway, where early in 1906 their influence was predomi nant, shows the latent strength and determination of the present regime in Russia. The Aslthabad-Firyuza Narrow Gavge Railway. —This line was opened for the usual summer traffic on 25th July and closed on the 3rd October. The total distance is 25^ miles, tiie average gradient one in 1889, and the average speed of an ordinary passenger train nine miles an hour. . A serious accident occurred on this line on the 18th September to some trollies conveying a company on the down grade from Firyuza to Ak-Tepe. Owing to the brake not acting the trollies ran away and overturned when rounding a curve. Thirty-seven out of 83 men were more or less seriously injured, and had to be conveyed to hospital. The Merv-Kushk Railway. —In September the question of transferring this railway from the Ministry of Communications to that of War was said to be under consideration. If this measure is carried out, the line will presum ably be worked exclusively by the Trans-Caspian Railway Battalion and the Kushk Railway Company. Railway to Cheleken —Unconfirmed reports have been received during the year of the projected construction of a branch line from Jebel, the sixth station from Kvasnovodsk on the Central Asian Railway, to Cheleken and thence possibly to Chikishlyar on the Persian frontier. It is not unlikely that the Russians have in contemplation the construction of a narrow grange line to that rich naptha-bearing region, more especially as the approaches from the sea are difficult for any but shallow draught vessels. Tejen-Ful-i-Khatun Railway .—Various rumours were prevalent early in the year of contemplated railway construction in the neighbourhood of Tejen and Sarakhs. Enquiries made in March revealed the absence of any prepara tions for such a purpose. But in April it was again reported that the Russians had under consideration the laying down of a narrow gauge line and that the material stored at Kushk would be utilised in its construction. Possibly the state of affairs in Persia prompted the authorities to make some enquiries as to the feasibility of the construction of a line from one of the places above named into that country, but the project appears to have progressed no further. Oxus River Railway. —The construction of a line from Kermene via Karshi to Termez which was first mooted in 1868 appears to be still engaging the atten tion of the authorities in Turkistan, as at the end of March two'Russian officers of rank, accompanied by a railway engineer, left Termez with the object, it was stated, of inspecting the different routes which were surveyed in 1905. There is nothing, however, to indicate that the project is to be taken in hand in the near future. Rostovstsevo-Kshtut Coal Mines. —In January the local press reported that a branch line was under construction from Rostovstsevo on the Central Asian Railway to the coal mines at Kshtut in the Penjakent, District of Samar kand, and that a coal station and stores were to be erected at the former place by the “ Turkistan Coal and Mining Industries Company.” The Kokand~Namavgan Railway. —The report current towards the end of 1907 that Prince Rhilkot had obtained the concession for the construction of this branch line has been confirmed, and early in January the shares w ere on sale in Tashkent. It was proposed to commence work on the line in March, but so few shares were taken up that this intention had to be abandoned, and in May it was stated that the project had been indefinitely postponed for want of money. In July local papers announced that orders had been issued to con struct the railway as a State enterprise; and that its construction is in progress or contemplated at an early date, is indicated by the report of large quantities of sleepers passing east through Charjui in December. Tashkent Interruptions to traffic. —The interruptions to traffic on the Tashkent Rail- way during 3908 were the most serious that have occurred since its opening As usual the section between Perovsk and Turkistan was the one most seriousfyaffected The severe snowstorms of February continually blocked the line between Aktyubinsk and Chelkar and between Iletsk and Orenburg, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that passenger traffic was kept open during this month while goods traffic was practically suspended as the number of engines was insufficient to provide the two engines to each train which were required at the time In April, when melting snows caused floods on the Sir Darya, the line aoain was interrupted between Orenburg and Aktyubinsk. The most serious interruption however occurred in July and A.ugust when the floods on the Sir Darya, which are described as the worst for twenty years, caused a total suspen sion of traffic for over a month. It is estimated that the resultant losses to the railway amounted to oyer £160,000. The preliminary accounts for the year, vide next page, show only a total loss of £95,000; thus had it not been for the floods some £60,000 profit would have been made. The urgent necessity of re-aligning the Turkistan-Perovsk Section of the railway, which is the sole means of preventing an annual recurrence of the breaches to the line, was engaging the attention of the authorities at St. Peters burg; in September. During that month the “ Novoye Vremya stated that a bill was to be presented to the Duma asking for a further grant of £3x5,000 for the reconstruction of the line and that work was to be commenced at once. In October the same paper reported that a special committee had lelt St. leteisburg to carry out preliminary surveys of the new alignment. Other cases of interruption of a minor nature were as follows: On the 19th. February a severe snow storm destroyed a number of the telegraph poles on the Jusala-Razabnsk section, and the attempt to run trains without telegraphic communica tion resulted in a general dislocation of traffic. On the 6th March, owing to a broken or intentionally loosened rail which was concealed under a snow drift, the Orenburg-Tashkent mail train was derailed and wrecked between Berchogur and Karaganda. Twelve persons were killed and 36 more or less seriously injured. On the 24‘th 25th April traffic was interrupted between Besh-Arik and ALuna by torrents, caused by melting snow. On the 16th June a collision at Tashkent between a passenger and a goods tram damaged the line and destroyed several goods wagons. ^ ^ , On the 13th September a passenger tram was derailed between Darbaza and Keles. In the middle of October Hoods on the Sir Darya endangered the safety of the embank ment near Kamishli Bash station. Many of these accidents and interrupt ions are apparently attributed by the authorities to ignorance on the part of subordinate railway employes, and in March it was reported by the Turkistan News that a special committee was to assemble in that month to examine railway servants in their knowledge of their duties and that this examination is in future to be an annual one. Bridals The frequent wash-outs that have occurred between Besh-Arik and Sauran, a distance of 16| miles, have necessitated the construction of a series of br.daea over this section at a cost of some £o,300. These bridges were rnmoleted in the course of the year, and it was hoped would prevent a recurrence of interruptions to this portion of the line by floods in the future, but see above, Turkistan-Perovsk section. Bollinq.stocJc.— Vide also this sub-head under the Central Asian Railway nn r&gt;a°‘e 22 According to the 1908 summer time-tables that are issued, ap- mrentlv confidentially, to the Railway Staff, the total number of engines avail- able on the Tashkent Railway, which officially extends from Kmel to Tashkent, a distance of 2,090 versts or 1,385! miles, is as follows (a) In time tables —2 postal ; 2, or now that the tri-weekly service V ; has been altered to daily (see below) 4, passenger ; 4 military ; 2 emigrants ; 2 mixed ; 11 through*goods ; and 85 local goods ; giving a total of 110 ; (h\ Not in time-tables .—2 passenger and mixed ; 4 for service of line ; 20 ballast and workmen’s; 4 station ; and 6 reserve; giving a total of 36 ; • * a owand total of 145. But at the end of 1906 the number of engines was stated officially to he 150 with 1,600 goods-wagons. These latter have been26 found quite inadequate to cope with the increasing traffic, and accordingly an addition of 800 was made from neighbouring lines about September. In October, however, the lack of rolling-stock was again making itself felt, no doubt partly in consequence of the accumulation of several hundred loaded wagons at Samara and Tashkent wdiich arose from the suspension of traffic in August. It was then reported by local newspapers that the administration had asked for a further large addition to the rolling-stock in order to deal with the great increase of traffic during the cotton export season. In November every station was said to be blocked with goods, mainly cotton and wheat, and in December the accumulation of goods at Tashkent station was increasing daily. Traffic .—Prom officially published statistics it appears that, as compared with 1906, the number of passengers on the Tashkent Railway increased in 1907 by 800,000, goods traffic by nearly 96,000 tons, and receipts by some £400,000. On the other hand, during the same period the receipts of the Central Asian Uailway decreased by over £30,000 {vide page 24.) The follow ing table, compiled from the “Russki Invalid,” “ Turkistan News ” and “ Trans- Caspian Review ” gives the traffic statistics for the former railway during the three years 1906-08 :— Tear.

On the 17th December a daily mail-train service replaced the tri-weekly service that had been in force between Samara and Tashkent. # The Tashkent station.—In connection with the extension of the Tashkent station it was stated by a local paper in January that the construction of a new naphtha reservoir with a capacity of 1,200 tons had been be&lt;?un. In June engi neers were engaged in drawing up plans and estimates for the enlargement'of the station which was, apparently, put in hand only in October, and by the end of December a new goods-depot was nearly complete. The enlargement of plat forms, passengers’ accommodation, etc., was to be begun in the sprint of 1909. Fide also below under “ Cost of Construction.” Administration.

As ibis committee, under the presidency of one Strizhazhevski, also inspected the Siberian and Trans-Baikal, lines, it is possible that it is a sub committee of a Royal Commis sion appointed by the Tsar in October of 1908 to enquire into the management, the continual excess of working expenses over earnings, the condition of the employes, etc., of ali the Russian Railways and to report on the developments of railways that are required in imperial and local interests. The members of the Committee are, besides a president and vice-president, 2 representatives each, from the higher posts, of the Ministries of Communications, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Interior, 'War, Justice and of the Departments of Agri culture and Audit. Cost of Construction .'—The Turkistan News in mid-November announced that of the extraordinary railway expenditure in 1909, some £101,000 is to be allotted to the reconstruction of the Southern Section of the line and the exten sion of Tashkent Station. It would appear from the figures given by this paper that the total cost of the Southern Section has already been £6,954,00t'. The Uralsk- Semipain Husk Railway. — The Ryazan-Uralsk Railway Com*. n ^ il t wa y A Pro;,ect9 pnny is reported to have asked Qovernment for the concession of the construe- c ' ra Sia ‘ tion of a line from Uralsk to Semipalatinsk with a Government guarantee. The line will be some 1,330 miles long and cost, it is estimated, 10| millions sterling, i.e., about £8,000 a mile. Connection of the Tashkent and Siberian Railways .—As stated in the 1907 Summary, there is no immediate prospect of the construction of a line con necting the Siberian and Tashkent Railways. But, according to the “ Novoye Vremya, ,, in July the question was engaging the attention of a group of Siberian capitalists, backed up by English financial houses, and the survey of the route was being continued. The same paper also stated in August that when the matter comes up for consideration preference will be given to a line joining Tashkent with Vverni, as such a line would open up a fertile tract of country in every way suitable for Russian colonization. The Omsk-Semipalatinsk or Southern Siberian Raihcay.-- This project of a private company, which comprises also a branch line to Barnaul, passed the Committee for the Construction of New Railways in November and, therefore, appears to have been accepted in principle. It will connect the Fskibaz-Tuzski coal mines with the Siberian Railway, and open up the Biisk district which not only has an enormous grain harvest but is the centre of exchange between Russia and Western Mongolia. The main line, which follows the Irtish and will be 450 miles long, will be joined at Pavlodar by the Barnaul branch, 302 miles; the cost of the total 752 miles is estimated at £5,360,000 or £7,100 per mile. The Tyumen-Omsk Railway .—As far back as 1902 it was stated that it had been decided to construct this line as a preferable alternative to doubling the Fkaterinberg-Kurgan-Omsk section of the Trans Siberian Railway. From information received during the year under review it appears that the alignment, which was reported to have been definitely settled, is still under consideration. Special reports are to he made on the question of water supply and the probable traffic and returns of the two alternative routes via, Tyumen- Omsk and Ekaterinburg-Kurgan. In November the “Novoye Vremya” announced the nearly £316,000 had been allotted in the 1909 Budget under extraordinary expenditure for beginning work on the Tyumen-Kurgan {sic) line, which would be a cross line joining the two alternatives just named. According to the “Novoye Vremya’ , this line was formally taken over from TbeTJiukhaniu Juifa the engineers by the Government in January, and regular goods and passenger hail ' ay - traffic was opened in the beginning of February ^S.C. 20 of 1908.) ihe train service, a daily one, has been Considerably accelerated and now takes under 7 hours, giving a speed, including 12 stops, of 16^ miles an hour. In spite of considerable opposition both in the Duma and in the Uppe 1 ’The Amur Kailway. House and much hostile criticism in the Press, the Amur Railway Bill was finally approved on the 19th June. It is hoped that the line will be completed ly 1912, but much depends upon the ability of the Government to find the money. In this connection it is of interest to note that reports were current as late as September that efforts were being made to interest British capitalists in the scheme, but apparently without suectss. The totalft-IS 28 • cost of the line is officially estimated at £26,105,233. Of this amount £1.725,535 has been sanctioned during 1908 and £1,579,OOo is to be proyidedm 1-0 • The line takes off at Kuenga Station on the Siberian Railway and will run to Khaiar- oysk, with bianch lines to Nerchinsk, and Blagoveshchensk, a total length ol 135 ] The trace practically follows the alignment which was surveyed m 1893-95. Vladivostok will thus he linked to Russia by a line of iail which or the whole of its length will lie in Russian territory. The intention of the Govern ment is to employ onlv Russian labour on its construction, and it was officially stated in September ‘that of 6,000 men already at work only 20 were Chinamen. The Caspian Sea On page 26 of the 1907 Summary it was stated that the 2 torpedo boats, Flotilla. the “ Fwilki ” and “ Pronizitelni ”, which arrived in the Caspian at the end of October 1907 , were to be followed by 3 more. The additional number ot boats however, was later raised to live—-of which four arrived at Baku from gj. Petersburg in August and leit early in Septembm lor Ashuiada. loe new boats, according to a report of the Trans-Caspian Review in March, were to have 4*7” and 2-95” guns and Dizel boilers. The Amu Darya The rumour current at the end of 1907 that the services of the Amu riotiiia. Darya Elotilla would he suspended on account of the extraordinarily low water was confirmed about the beginning of January wh&lt;m all traffic was stopped ; and it was not until the middle of February that the services were renewed. Navigation w r as again interfered with in May by exceptionally heavy floods, and in the middle of December down-stream traffic from Charjui had to be suspended owing to low water. 'Some change has been made in the services in 1908 by Staff Circular 102. The Char jui-Termez services are, in summer, a weekly postal passenger service from May to mid-November taking 5 days up and 2 clays downstream, and a towing w eekly or fortnightly service from May to early December taking 8 days up and 2 days downstream; and (2) in winter, a weekly goods passenger service from end-October to end-April (with a break from mid-January to 20th February), taking 11 days up and 7 days down. For some years the flotilla lias been run at a dead loss to Government, as is demonstrated by the subjoined table, and more than once it has been reported that negotiations were in progress to transfer the management to a private company. Hitherto the negotiations have alw r ays ended in failure, generally on the question of subsidy. If reports which have appeared in the focal papers are to he believed, the Government has at last succeeded in coming to an agreement with a company which trades under the name of the “ Sirotkin Steamship Company.” I his company is also engaged in exploiting the mercantile trade of the Aral Sea and, it is stated, will take over all the Gov ernment steamers and barges on the Amu and Sir Daryas on a 25 years’ lease. It also undertakes to put on these rivers several new steamers which, according to one report, have already arrived.

In April the river was again in flood, carrying away another building and threatening to destroy a newly constructed block of officers’ quarters on the low lying ground on the right bank of the river. A report by a special committee of engineers showed that the floods were in a great measure*due to the gradual reclamation of over 2J square miles of the river bed by Uzbak cultivators who had constructed dams to this end, audit recommended that a strong dam should be constructed to divert the river back to its former channel. Orders were at once issued to start the work, much to the dissatis faction of the Uzbek cultivators who refused the compensation in the shape of money and land offered them. There is apparently no intention of replacing the bridge across the Sir Bl Darya at Khojent, which was closed to traffic at the end of 1907 and is reported to have been dismantled. The ferry which replaced the bridge is now the only means of communication across the Sir Darya between Tashkent and Ferghana, except the iron railway bridge at Chinaz; but the Khojent Town Council was said in March to be contemplating the addition of a second ferry. The local Press during 1908 has drawn frequent attention to the had R condition of many of the roads in Turkistan. The Turkistan Agricultural Society, discussing in March the means of reducing the difficulties of food supply for the native population, came to the conclusion that the chief cause of dearness of food in the country was the disgraceful state of the bye-roads which are said to be practically impassable in wet weather. The old Tashkent-Chim- kent post road, the Chinaz road, and the roads connecting Tashkent with the country beyond the Chirchik, which, it is to be noted, is the chief cereal-produc ing region in the whole district, were all stated to he in a very bad state. In wet weather communication between adjacent villages entirely ceases. Little amelioration in this respect is to be expacted owing to lack of funds. Kharukh—Mur ihabi road. — Two separate reports received in July stated that the condition of this road was very bad and that no repairs had been done to it for a very long time. In parts it is practically impassable even for pack animals. Murghabi — Kizil-Robat road. —In October this road was reported to be in a bad condition but wide enough for wheeled traffic. Shighnan—Langar-i-Kikin. —At the end of 1907 a report was received that the Russians were busy making a cart road from Shighnan to Kikin. This report has been confirmed. The road is 6 feet wide and runs from Kharigh through Gbaran (Milvaj) and Run to Langar-i-Kikin. In November a few bridges had been repaired between Shighnan and Kikin. Osh — Andijan. —In April it was reported that a motor passenger service was to be established on this road. Tashkent — Chimgan. —This road was closed in May owing to the danger ous state of the Iskander embankment along which it runs. Chimgan is a hill station, 48 miles north-east of Tashkent, and the road thither passes through Jaman-Jar. There is an alternative route via Sailik. Termez — Kara-Kala.—it wa s reported in August from Termez that a large party of surveyors was engaged on the survey of a cart road between Termez and Kokand. The proposed alignment passes through Ealjuan, Kulab (Kulyab) and Karategin, Eastern Bokhara. The existing route between these places is said to be only fit for pack transport. A good road between Kokand and Termez undoubtedly should be of strategic value, owing to the diffi cult country to the east of the latter place and to the facilities it would provide for bringing supplies into Termez. The rumour is more particularly of interest in view of the efforts to hasten the industrial development of this region. Kizil’Avvat— 'Kara Kala. —During January floods interrupted traffic on this road.30 1 Teleargph*. Travels. Trade. Banks. Labour. rrigation. u In connection with the roads in the neighbourhood of the Pamirs it was reported in JMay that the .Russians were building opposite Rozai Gumbaz a store-house and caravanserai for the convenience of caravans from Badakkshan. Charjui- Termez .—In 1907 confirmation was received of the reported exist ence of a subaqueous cable between Charjui and Termez. Rut subsequent enquiries tend to show that the only cable in the river bed is that which carries the wire from the south to the north bank at Kerki, and that a single wire runs from this place along the north bank to Termez only. Thus it would seem that the reports of a wire from Kerki to Karshi are untrue. Temez-Kulab .—The report quoted in the 1907 Summary of the establish ment of telegraphic communication between Termez and Kulab (Kulyab) has not been confirmed. Beliographic Communication. Pi local paper states that heliographic com munication is maintained during the summer between Osh and the Convalescent Depot at Jelahtbad, about 30 miles to the north. At the end of January it was reported that two Prenchmen, MM. Rudeleau and Zabiechu, bad been granted permission to travel in Russian Turkistan, The latter is probably the Zabikhu (or Z ibic'i a or Zabichu) who accompanied de la Coste in 1906, and is alleged to be a Russian, In September two other Frenchmen, MM. Mulen and De Fuji, were reported to he at Askhabad. They are said to be journalists under the aegis of the French Geographical Society. Permission was granted in October to a German, Friederich Zolger, to visit Turkistan, and to stop at Krasnovodsk, Merv, Andijan and Kazalinsk. At the end of November, Major Matsuke Khansomate, a Japanese Officer, was expected in Turkistan. Apparently he was proceeding via Tashkent to Krasnovodsk, and had received permission to visit xTndijan and Bokhara. Commercial. The industrial progress of Ferghana may he judged by the strides which are being made by individual places ou the Andijan branch-line, almost every one of which is now a large centre of trade. The Assake trading and agricultural region which includes Sharikban, Karatyepin, Niazbatwir and Kuvin is said to have an annual turnover of over £1,250,000. Cotton exports from this region alone are valued at over £900,000 and the silk industry is said to yield over £100,000 yearly. The growing prosperity of the district is indicat ed by the fact that in June a proposal was submitted to the Ministry of Trade and Industry to open a branch of the Imperial Treasury at Assake. In February a Government Treasury was opened at Fodgornoye in Semire- chya. A branch of the Siberian Trading Company was opened in March at Vyerni and in September it was reported that the Azof-Don Commercial Bank, one of the largest trading hanks in Southern Russia, was opening a branch at Tashkent. Vide also “Trade,” supra. As indicating the development of industries in Ferghana, which is turnino* the population into traders and leaving the agricultural work to imported labour, it is of interest to note that during the spring and summer months about 20,000 Kasbgari labourers find work in that province. On page 27 of the 1907 Summary reference is made to two irrigation works, viz .the Bairam Ali Canal On which, it was said, repairs had been stopped* and a canal from the Amn Darya which was reported to have been be&lt;nm! Both these reports have proved to be unfounded. The work on the Hindu-Kush, or Bairam Ali, dam, near Alam-Tepe, has been prosecuted with great energy throughout the year. It would appear ’that in January the irrigation works on the Crown Lands at Bairam Ali bad fallen into such a bad state of repair and that the dam was originally built of such unreliable material i.e., earth and brushwood instead of stonework, that the railway embankment in this neighbourhood was seriously damaged in Janu- aiy. In lebiuary the danger to the line was so great that practically tho Mlwhole of the 2nd Trans-Caspian Sapper Battalion was employed on the bund, in addition to over 1,100 labourers who were later increased to 2,000. At this, time, too work was in progress at the Band-i-Tekke (? Kaushut-chan-Band) which is also on the Murghab and secures Merv from floods, while at Tejen, where, as noted in the 1907 Summary, the railway embankment is liable to frequent wash outs, sappers from Kushk were also being employed. The tram line, vide 1907 Summary, at the Hindu-Kush Band was completed early in the year; it runs for some*3 miles from Yulatan to Alam-Tepe, is of 28-inch gauge and was being used for the carriage of earth and other materials for the re-construction of the dam. Brick-kilns had also been made to provide material not only for the bund but also for a settlement of 100 Bussian families that had been founded near Alam-Tepe. The opportunity of the repairs to the dam appears to have been utilized to make it strong enough to retain sufficient water for the supply not only of the Crown Lands but also of Kurban Kala, to which a canal, 4f feet deep by 11 wide, was being built; as early as the end of March about f mile of this canal had been completed. The bund is described as being 1,500 yards lon&lt;?, for, although the w^ater is but 1 00 yards wide at Alam-Tepe, the river is 1,000. What appears to be but a temporary wooden bridge for the transport of materials was also being constructed at this spot. By mid-September the bund was said to be nearly completed, the canal was being pushed on and work was still in progress on the bridge. But it would appear that the repairs of the irrigation works were not entirely satisfactory for in the third week of October local papers stated that the embankment and bridges between Merv and Bairam Ali were in danger of being washed away. As regards the Amu Darya-Murghab Canal, local papers stated in March that this project, which was to bring some 1,315,000 acres under cultivation, was to he put in hand shortly ; enquiries made on the spot ascertained that the alignment of a canal had been pegged out from Kerki to Bairam Ali but that no'work w^as in hand. At the end of October it was alleged that a start bad been made at the Bosagha end, possibly of a merely local canal to satisfy the requirements of the new Bussian colony at that place, but the cost of construc tion proved to be so great that the larger idea was given up. A fortnight later the news of the abandonment of the project was confirmed by the local press which added, as a further reason, that the land which was to be brought under irrigation had been found to be nothing but sand and gravel. Cotton .—According to the local press several Bourse Committees have been engaged during 1908 on the question of the further development of the cotton growing industry in Turk'stan. Both at Moscow and Kokand the question of a better system of irrigation and the prospect of cotton growing in (1) Uch-Kurghan and the Vidizan District, and (2) along the Ulyuk and the Sir Darya in the Kokand District w ere said to be under consideration. In May it was reported that a group of capitalists had approached the Finance Minister with a request for a concession of some 5,000,000 acres of land in the Hungry Steppe with a view to bringing it under cotton cultivation. It was calculated that, if this enterprise were successful, Russia would be in a position to supply herself with all the cotton she requires and need not therefore spend some £8.000,000 yearly on the purchase of this commodity abroad. In July reports were received from Termez that a cotton spinning mill was being erected there. This, the first, attempt to establish a regular cotton factory at Termez is of more than passing interest in view of the strategical position of Termez in relation to Afghanistan. It is not impossible that the industrial development of Termez may be utilized to accelerate the construc tion of the Samarkand-Termez railway. It was reported in May that a company had been formed for the erection of a steam-ginning mill at Tejen with a capital of about £53,000, and later that a cotton cleaning factory was being built at Dragomirovo, a station on the Andijan Branch line about il miles from Khojent. Rep &gt;rts received in August gave promise of an excellent cotton crop in Fercdiana but serious damage was caused by early frosts and rains in October with the result that (a) the output per acre was only 1,100 lbs, as compared with 1,200 in 1907 and an average of 2,000 lbs, and (b) the quality also deterio rated. ? It is said, too, that many firms had sufiered financially.The total harvest for the year was 127,150 tons, about one-tenth of which, i e 12,400 tons, came from Trans-Caspia. Far the largest share falls 1o Fer ghana,’*^: 87,500 tons; the Samarkand and Sir Darya provinces produced 7,600 and 6,600 respectively, and the 2 Khanates, i.e.t Bokhara and Khiva, a combined total of 13,050 tons. From information which has been received during the year it appears that while the area under cotton in Turkistan is still rapidly growing, the chances of Turkistan eventually becoming self-supporting in corn are greater than is generally believed. During the last two years considerable progress has been made in the cultivation of the latter commodity on land which does not require artificial irrigation. The statistics of the cultivated area for 1907 show that on the higher land over 810,000 acres were under wheat and barley, with a total yield of some 435,000,000 lbs. In 1908 a considerable addition was made to the area under cultivation. No attempt has yet, however, been made^ to grow grasses such as lucerne on the non-irrigated foothills, where cultivation is cheaper and land-rent ten times less than in the irrigated country, but there is reason to believe that such attempts would prove highly remunerative. In Semirechya, too, the area under corn considerably increased in 1908. The harvests were excellent in the majority of the districts of Trans-Caspia and Turkistan. The Murghab Imperial Domains, where harvesting operations take place in July and where 20,491 acres are under cereal cultivation, yielded 20,649,600 lbs. of wheat and 3,859,200 lbs. of barley. Sarakhs has for many years been an important supply centre, more especially as an entrepot for sheep and forage from Persia, and its importance in this respect is apparently growing for it was found necessary in October to appoint another Intendance officer there. The severe winter of 1907 caused considerable losses among the cattle of the Kirghiz in the Kulja District, and a consequent rise in the price of meat in the Ferghana Province which is to a large extent dependent for its cattle supply on Semirechya. During 1907 by the Chetti Pass-Uzgen route alone 450.000 sheep and 12,000 horses were said to have been imported into Ferghana. Uzgen is one of the most important distributing centres for this trade, and a cattle fair is held there twice a w r eek during the summer months. A local paper puts the total import of live-stock from Afghanistan by the Panjdeh route at 500 cattle and 2,€00 sheep. The only firm in the Ferghana Province, i.e., in the whole of Turkistan, that has so far placed its oil-springs on a working basis is the “ Chimion. ,, It w as on the point of liquidation early in the year but the energy of a new manager saved it from falling, like many other undertakings in Turkistan, into the hands of the Jew r s. During the 12 months from mid-November 1907 some 32.000 tons of oil w^ere obtained, realizing a gross profit of £91,000 and a net profit of £21, *00. It has a distillery in working order and sold from it 6 500 tons in the course of the working year. Naphtha.—In April work was begun on Prince Khilkof’s petroleum conces sion at Maili Saiin the Kokand District. It was reported that contracts had been concluded for the supply of naphtha to the Central Asian and Tashkent railways. Further rich fresh discoveries of petroleum have been made at Cheleken Island during the year and this oil-field bids fair to rival Baku. In July a local paper declared that the Russian Government had decided to take over and exploit the Cheleken oil-field as an Imperial undertaking, but no confirmation has been received of this report. Fide also p. 25 as to the projected railway to Cheleken. J Coal .—Early in the year prospecting for coal was begun at Suret-Tash in the Sekh A^olost of the Kokand District and in June coal mining concessions at Burdi, Uch-Kurghan, Adwir and Markai were offered for sale by auction. Copper. —Copper-mining concessions have been granted to prospectors in the neighbourhood of Karabuk and Danayaul on the Asfara river.33 x o?er. 1 1600 ’ s that ranees 'an ij i been squire at on 1 total ide to grow ion is there , In 'aspia tions ‘Med lore nee to of n Le le to is lie ian, m.” new into some a net 6,500 oncee* ? had hkent jleken i local jr and nation .wayt° lash in dons at tors i fl Climate and Health.

The year 1908 resembled 1907 in that the opening months were marked by severe snowstorms and intense cold in almost all parts of Turkistan. The snows at Jarkent were reported as unparalleled within the memory of the oldest inhabitants and caused considerable loss among the Kirghiz cattle. Petro- Alexandrovsk reported that the winter was the severest which had been experienced for 25 years. Although at Charjui the Oxus was actually frozen over for only two days, still in the middle of January it was continually blocked by ice in the upper and lower reaches. Snow fell continuously for 48 hours at Askhabad between the 22nd and 24th January. This snow and cold caused frequent interruptions on both the Central and Tashkent Bail ways and for several weeks rendered communication by road almost impossible. Heavy rains fell at the end of March and, combined with the melting snows, caused floods on most of the rivers, which continued to mid-April, and a further suspension of traffic for two days on the Tashkent railway. .Torrential rains at the end of June and the beginning of July asrain caused serious floods on the Sir Darya which so seriously damaged the Tashkent railway that traffic was not resumed for several weeks. At the end of August excessive heat was reported all over Trans-Caspia and along the Oxus, and was the cause of so much distress to the troops that all military training had to be suspended in the 2nd Turkis tan Army Corps. Numerous cases of sunstroke w^ere reported, too, from Krasnovodsk. Vide “ Dysentery ” infra. Syphilis .—Early in the year sypbpis was reported to he on the increase Health, among the troops in Trans-Caspia ; it appears to have been especially prevalent at Askhabad, Merv and Kushk. Malarial About the middle of July fever of a particularly virulent type which attacked the younger soldiers especially was reported as being pre valent at Merv and Kushk. At the end of the same month an exceptionally virulent attack was reported at Termez among both the inhabitants and troops; of the latter 6-10 were dying daily and all training had to be suspended. Dysentery .—In August fever and dysentery, as well as sunstroke, vide supra, caused so much sickness at Krasnovodsk that the bulk of the garrison had to be moved to Eiryuza, leaving only about 300 men behind. Distilled water was alleged to be the cause, and, therefore, drinking water was being brought in from the hills. C/b; ter a.—About the same time acute dysentery, which was at first mistaken for cholera, appeared at Askhabad. Elaborate precautions were then taken to guard the Afghan frontier. The appearance of true cholera at Astrakhan in the beginning of August attracted the attention of the authorities to the necessity of establishing quarantine at Krasnovodsk and at the end of August a sanitary corps, ICO strong, and 100 Frontier Guard and 50 Cossacks were transferred there from Askhabad. It was, however, not from the Caspian Sea that cholera did eventually enter Turkistan, but along the Tashkent railway. It first appeared at Tashkent on the 27th August; from that date it rapidly assumed epidemic form and early in October the daily mor tality in the capital was reported as 50—60, and in the city and district as 250— 300. In September it reached the Samarkand, Eerghana and Sir Darya Provinces. For a few weeks the precautions taken by the authorities were successful in preventing the disease from spreading into Trans-Caspia, but in October cases were reported at Merv whither the sanitary corps, previously sent to Krasno vodsk, had been recalled on the 27th September. About the same time, too, cholera, though not in epidemic form, was reported at Khiva, Charjui and Fort Alexandrovsk. In November the Samarkand District was declared free of cholera, but 10 deaths occurred in the last week of December and, although with the cold weather the disease ceased to be epidemic, sporadic cases were also occuring at Tashkent and in the Sir Darya Province.34 Administration Chinese Turkistan. Chinese Officials. Yaschur.—kn outbreak of Yaschur was reported from Askhabad early in July, but it doe^ not appear to have been of a serious nature. Glanders. —A. few oases of glanders were reported at Askhabad in Nov ember and December and 4 at Yulatan in November. Locusts.—\n January great damage was done by locusts in the Kkojent, Jizakj Samarkand and Katta-Kurghan Districts. SOUTHERNCHI&amp;A. Political. Although the civil administration of Chinese Turkistan continues to run on the old lines, nevertheless a change is noticeable, not so much in the realities as in the tendencies, and significant as reflecting the general effort of China towards regeneration. Efforts are being made to purify the administration ot its greater abuses. Taxes are being levied with a lighter hand and according to the recognised scale. And Wei-Yuens, or secret emissaries of the provincial governor, continually travel semi-incognito through the districts, hearing what the people have to say about the capacity of their Ambans and denouncing the latter to the higher authorities. It was stated in January that, as a result of the reports of these TTei-Yuens, the Esien Ivuans of Dob, Gfoma and Kaigaiik and the Ting Kuan of Yang-i-Hissar had been summarily dismissed. These high-handed proceedings on the part of the Urumchi authorities have naturally- aroused the resentment and lowered the influence of the local officials, and the Tao-tai of Aksu went so far as to place one of the Wei-Yuens in chains on the pretence that he was an impositor. In April the Tao-tai of Kashgar called a meeting of the Kashgar Elders and explained to them that he had been ordered to appoint a Ni-Yuen or advisory council of eight* men at the head-quarters of every PIsien Chow or Eu. The object of these councils is to keep the District officials informed of the condition of affairs in their respective districts. Their powers of offering advice are not to be restricted to any particular sphere. They will be empowered to make direct representations to the Tao*tai with the result, it is hoped, of mitigating the grievances with regard to arbitrary exactions of revenue and the administration of justice by the local Ambans. The idea appears to have excited little enthusiasm and in December the council had not been formed. This passive opposition to the scheme may per haps be partly attributed to the action of the Kashgar Yamen which fears a curtailment of its own powers. The announcement that a Chinese Official would be appointed to watch the deliberations of the Council has also contribut ed to its unpopularity. It is not unlikely that if it should eventually assemble its powers will be no greater than those of an ordinary Municipal Council, although, according to a Russian source of information, it is possible that it will be from these councils that the delegates to the Central Parliament at Peking will subsequently be elected. It is worthy of notice that shortly after the meeting at the Tao-tai’s Yamen two factions rapidly began to shape themselves, one, the Artush party, the stronger with progressive tendencies, under the leadership of Hosain Bai Dacha, a rich and influential merchant, and the other the Town party, more conservative, which acknowledges as its leader another rich merchant, Karim Bai Bacha. The spread of education is being encouraged by the local authorities, for not only is an attempt being made to establish a Chinese School at Kashgar, vide infra “ Taxation,” but in December a similar school was also reported to have been opened at Khotan and another at Sarikol. In June Tsiang arrived from Urumchi to take up the post of Chow Kuan of Kashgar new city. Tulu Bai, for 15 years Ishk Agha Beg of Sarikol, was dismissed for incom petence and disloyalty in May and replaced by Sulaiman Beg, a man of stronger character. In July a new Amhan for Tashkurghan passed through Kashgar from Urumchi. * Later apparently increased to 20 at Kashgar.35 early ia Hoy. ran on Jalities China lion of )rdin!&gt; ’incial what ig the it of &gt;aiiJc iese ’ally the the ws m ;n ils jrs ill it oi lea aeil pev- leats Ikial ibnt- enable nncil) it will Peking ;er the iselves, er the 3 other nother ies, ashg^i jrted to ' iocon 1 * mail of ar In the same month Kan Tajen, Ambnn of Yarkand, was dismissed, probably on account of his inability to settle the outstanding cases between British and Chinese subjects which have been the subject of frequent reference to Peking, as well as on account of his extortions. His successor arrived at the end of August. In July, too, a rumour was current that the Amban of Uch-Turfan, Peng Tajen, had been relieved in consequence of his Muhammadan proclivities which betook no trouble to disguise during the Hindu*Muhammadan fracas in 1907. In August the Tung-Shang of Kashgar returned to that town, on being relieved of the acting appointment of Amban of Yangi Hissar by the newly appointed permanent incumbent from Urumchi. In December was reported the dismissal of the] Amban of Keriya and his replacement by the Amban of Goma. The Hsien-Kuan of Kashsar, remarkable for his incorruptibility, was said to have resigned at the end of December on account of ill-health; probably, the real cause is pressure brought to bear by the Taotai. In May the notables (Bais) of Kashgar suggested the substitution of a land Tftxafclon * tax, in place of a proposed tax on deaths and marriages, to provide funds for a school, the establishment of which was being urged by the Central Government. The suggestion was approved but the rate of the tax was not settled. In December it was reported that none of the native inhabitants of Kashgar would have anything to do with the Chinese school. At the end of June the Provincial Governor ordered the collection of a new customs, tax called by the Chinese Ying-hua-Shui which literally means stamp duty. This tax corresponds apparently to the trade license system of Russia and is the first step which has been taken towards the adoption in Kashgaria of foreign methods of raising revenue. In May it was reported that a likin official had arrived at Urumchi and that another was en route to Kashgar. The new scale of customs dues imposed by the Chinese on taking over the customs from the merchants has been the cause of several representations on the part of the traders in Kashgar to the Taotai. The new duties amount to about 6| per cent, ad valorem and cannot be considered excessive, although they appear so to the merchants as the old rates were absurdly low. In March complaints were made to the Taotai by merchants in Kashgar Currency and Banks, of the large amount of bad money in circulation. It was stated that the mint was employing 20 per cent, alloy instead of the legal 8 per cent. Demands, therefore, were made for the introduction of the staple currency of Kasligaria, mz., pure silver, and it was pointed out that the debasement of the coinage was likely to lead to a rise in the price of all commodities owing to the difficulty of distinguishing good money from bad. In December it was reported that the Amban of Kliotan was arranging to start a local bank. Captain A. R. B. Shnttleworth was formally recognised as British Consul Anglo . Chinese Rela . at Kashgar on the 24th August in accordance with instructions issued to the tions. Taotai of Kashgar by the Wai-wu-pu at Peking. The appointment was officially recognised by the Russian Consul on the 5th September. There is every indication that the change in designation has given general satisfaction to all classes of the community, and especially to British subjects, who feel that no\tf the British representative has the same status as the Russian the latter’s ascendancy v/ill be less marked in the future. During the Consul’s autumn tour through the districts of Yarkand and Khargalik evidence was received from all sides of the great increase of British prestige in Kashgaria brought about by the improvement in his status. Further testimony to the improvement in Anglo-Chinese relations is afford ed by reports of December which announced that all the old claims of British subjects against inhabitants of Yarkand had been settled and that at Khotan the Chinese were treating our subjects with fairness.Ml British officials Kashgaria. Rusao-Chiaese Relations. 30 In May, in reply to representations by Mr. Macartney claiming exemption from customs dues for a British subject at Kuchar, an attempt was made by the Governor of the Province to dispute the claim on the grounds that the New Dominion was not open for foreign trade and that any such concession exceeded the terms of the Treaty between Great Britain and China. Mr. Macartney was fortunately able to quote a communication from the Taotai of Kashgar to Colonel Miles in 1903 which stated that both British and Russian subjects would be exempt from customs duties on their goods to the north and south of the Tian Shan; the claim was then recognized. On the 30th June Mr. Macartney was relieved by Captain Shuttleworth, Supply and Transport Corps {vide also Anglo-Chinese Relations and Travels). On the 29th April Abdulla Jan, Indian Aksakal at Yarkand, resigned the appointment. Mr. Macartney had reason to complain of his interference in local affairs and of his suspicious behaviour in certain suits brought against him for the recovery of money. He was replaced by Gauri Mai, a Hoshiarpuri, who has held the appointment of Aksakal at Yarkand on three previous occasions. On the 6th August the Aksakals of Kargalik, one Assanand, and of Goma were deprived of their office by the Consul as they had been concerned in the torture of a Hindu some 5 months previously. On the 12th November the Kargalik Aksakalship was conferred on Veramal. At the end of February the encouragement which was being openly given by the Russian Consul at Kashgar to the acquirement of land and property by Russian subjects in Kashgaria was causing the Chinese authorities some anxiety. The Russians, apparently, relied on certain provisions in the Russo-Chinese Treaty of Peking (Articles VI and VIII, paragraph 7) and on the Treaty of St. Petersburg, 1881, Article XIII. An incident which arose over the distribution of the estate of a deceased Russian subject appears to have considerably irritated the Chinese owing to the refusal of M. Kolokolof to permit any but Andijanis to bid for the property. It was reported that the Taotai had issued orders to one of his officials to draw up a report on the Russian Treaty rights on the subject of land acquisition, so that the matter might be referred to the Chinese Government. The Russian Consul stated in March that he had been asked by his Gov ernment to submit proposals for enlarging the powers of the Consular Court to those of a Court of Appeal. The “Novoye Vremya” of the 15th March reported that M.Fyodorof, Rus sian Consul at Kulja, and the Consul at Urumchi had proceeded on leave. In July the posts of dragoman and doctor to the Russian Kashgar Consulate were created by the Ministry of Foreign affairs, but no appointments thereto had been made by the end of the year owing to the lack of funds. M. Kolokolof, Russian Consul at Kashgar, proceeded on a year’s furlough to Russia early in October. M. Bobrovnikof is officiating for him during his absence or pending the appointment of a more senior member of the Consular service. In February The Russian Consul informed Mr. Macartney that in a trade report he had advocated the establishment of a Russian Consulate at Chia-yu- Kuan (Su-Chow in the Kansu Province), as a consulate there would afford a useful trait d’union between Eastern and Western China and as Russian goods from Kashgaria and Hi find their way in considerable quantities to Tun-huang and Cbia-yu-kuan. Russia’s right to take this step was accorded by the Treatv of St. Petersburg, 1881. In March it was reported that the Russians contemplated sending Haii Beg, son of Alif Beg, the late independent ruler of Sarikol, to this place as their contractor pycg Mirza Sayad Akram. The appointment of Haji Beg who has lived at Andijan since the death of his father would, it was hopeeb lead eventually to his replacing Karim Beg as Hakim Beg, and to a corresponding increase of Russian influence, at Sarikol.Apart from the consular staff and its escort there were in Kashgar in De cember 16 permanent Russian residents in official employ, viz., 5 at the Russo- Chinese Bank, 9 at the Customs and 2 at the Post Office. In Pebruary Mr. Hammerbek was transferred from the Askhabad branch R«sso-Chmesebank. of the Russo-Chinese Bank to the management of the Kashgar branch. The only disturbances which were reported during the year occurred at I)lsturbances * Merket early in Pebruary iu consequence of the extortionate proceedings of the Amban of Maralbashi. Military. Prom reports received during the year it appears beyond doubt that a Chinese Garmon*, scheme is on foot for materially increasing the troops in the New Dominion. With regard to the troops stationed south of the Tian Shan no steps have apparently been taken to bring them into line with those north of that range. It is expected that some of the foreign-drilled instructors will shortly be deputed there, but for drill and instruction only, as the corps will remain under their present commanders for discipline. Of this scheme the following details were published in the Russki Invalid of the 5th May, quoting the Official Gazette of Peking which contained a report on the subject by the Governor at Urumchi. It is proposed to divide the whole province into 5 districts with the following garrisons :— Infantry Cavalry regiments. regiments. Kashgar ... ••• ••• ••• ^ ^ Aksu ... ... ••• ••• ••• ^ 5 Knlja... ... ... ... ••• 5 I Urumchi ... ••• ^ ^ Barkaul ... ... ••• ••• ^ Total ... 32 27 The establishment of an Infantry and Cavalry regiment is respectively 301 and 181, inclusive of non-combatants. The total establishment of the reorgan ised local troops is, however, to be limited to 14,639 officers, non-commissioned officers and men, 1,701 syces and 3,645 horses, besides 594 supernumerary to establishment. An important innovation is the liability of “ liang-tsus” or regiments to be moved to any part of the province, instead of as formerly remaining permanently at one place. Its weak point, and one which is likely greatly to retard its realisation, is the retention of the old cadre of officers. The titles of officers, however, are said to have been changed, e.^., Titai (general) to Chung-tung, and Hsietai (colonel) to Tung-ling. The following reports indicate the progress which has been made :— {a) In June it was reported that barracks were under construction near Kulja at Kurram which, it was stated, will eventually become, instead of Hi, the head-quarters of the Chiang Chun and have a garrison of 6,000 men of the new model. (6) In the same month a report was received that 5,000 men, includ ing some horsemen at Urumchi, were being drilled by 100 foreign-drilled instrucUrs and that the Chinese General, Hupeh, at Hi was also starting the new drill. (c) Lieutenant Whitaker, w ho arrived in Kashgar early in July, reported that at New Suidun, north-west of Kulja, were 2 battalions of trained Chinese infantry which were still being trained by Japanese drill instructors, that the barrack accommodation was good, and that parades and rifle ranges had been provided in the neighbour hood of the barracks. (d) The “ Semireckya Provincial News ” stated in March that there is a Military School and a number of workshops at New Suidun; and according to another Russian report it is intended to increase the garrison at this place and to establish other military posts in the Hi Province.88 (&lt;?) At the beginning of August tlie Tao-tai called for a report on the strength, health, etc., of the troops at Kashgar, and it was also stated that 2,000 men of the newly trained Army were shortly coming from Urumchi. But a report of the end of Sep tember stated the new troops were not to arrive until the autumn of 1909. (/) In August, too, Captain Cheape reported that he had been very much struck with the smart appearance and discipline of 100 Kalmaks of the old Chinese army whom he had seen at Ili. (p) In October 8,000 men of the new model, wearing Japanese uniforms, were said to have reached Ili from Urumchi. Communications. The Kashgar-Narin The new Kashgar-Narin cart road was opened for traffic in September, but Road * a good deal of blasting still remained to be done near the Turgat Pass, and the alignment of the section of 10 miles between Pass Kurghan, 50 miles north of Kashgar, and Chakmak where blasting is also required, had not been finally decided. This section presents considerable difficulties owing to the narrowness of the valley and the liability of the road to flood. The Chinese favoured an alignment via Upper Artush and Isligh Kurghan to the Karateke Pass and thence back into the Turgat valley slightly above Chakmak. An examination of this route, however, proved the impracticability of the Karateke Pass and was accordingly rejected by M. Kolokolof, who favoured an alignment at first from Isligh Kurghan via the Bakurut Pass to the Turgat Valley at Pass Kurghan, and later from Isligh Kurghan to Kokiya and thence over the Kotaz- Pol Pass into the Saraman valley to Tion Teba. Another alternative, which necessitates a good deal of blasting, was to carry the road over some half dozen intervening spurs. The laying out of this section of the road had given the Russian Consul so much trouble that in July he asked Captain Shuttleworth to assist him in selecting the trace, which Captain Shuttleworth agreed to do and accompanied M. Kolokolof to the spot. But, owing to the exorbitant tolls which the Chinese are allowed to charge and the greater conveniences afford ed by the route to Andijan, there is practically no traffic on the road and little can be expected until a railway reaches Narin. Leh Por many years the trade on this route has suffered from the defective orga nisation of the transport. The custom of giving a caravanbashi more than one load and the overloading of the ponies, large numoers of which die on the road, have caused serious losses to merchants and enhanced the cost of carriage. Captain Shuttleworth represented this matter to the Chih-fu of Yar kand in September and, at his suggestion, an aksakal was specially appointed to the Customs House at Hoshiarpur to see that no pony load exceeds maunds and that no caravanbashi is given more than one load. ishkoaam ghdum Ti a ade Representations were made to Captain Shuttleworth in September by mer- Route Uam iaae chants in Kashgar on the subject of opening the Taghdumbash-Ishkonam route for trade, as the Karakoram route is long, difficult, open only for six months in the year, and avoided by many traders. In view of the political and military importance of the former route Captain Shuttleworth returned dis couraging answers, but when reporting the matter expressed himself in favour of a ie*eonsideration of the closing of the Taghdumbash route. Personal observation had convinced him that the road could be easily made impassable by a few pounds of dynamite at the Min taka Pass and that both that pass and the Kilik could be held by a small force against greatly superior numbers. Nothing could prevent a large hostile force from arriving at the northern mouth of either the Mintaka or the Kilik without much difficulty even if there were no road on the '1 aghdumbash, because it is a broad open valley for the most part. Once these passes were forced, further natural obstacles w ould be found in the Hunza or Ishkoman valleys; and these difficulties would not be perceptibly lessened if each or both contained a narrow r mule track which could easily be destroyed at various points by blowing up the suspension bridges. The closing of The Yarkan d Trade Route.the route was stifling trade and preventing lakhs of rupees from entering India’s pockets. A report received in October stated that this road, which had been badly Uz kena-Targ»t Pas* damaged by rain in 11P8, had recently been repaired and was fit for pack and (Snok) Toun transport. Rumours that it will be made fit for wheeled traffic as soon as the Passes - Kashgar-Narin Road is completed appear to have little foundation. A reconnaissance of this road was made by Captain Shuttleworth in Octo- Yarkand-Merket her. It was found to be in good condition and fit for wheeled artillery through- Koild - out. The whole of the country through which the road passes is very fertile and well irrigated. Supplies, sheep and cattle are plentiful. Lieutenant Whitaker reported that a new wooden bridge was being built The chimkent-Kuija at Maakend to replace the ferry. Road - A new road appears to have been built recently between these places so as A ™e charpak- to avoid a difficult pass between Ters and Kuyuk. The new rond is longer and is closed during the spring thaws by floods, whereas the old road remains open although it is rendered difficult'by mud. The Cossack pickets between Chingildi and Kulja have been withdrawn, except that at Suidun. The old wooden bridge across the Hi river at Ilisk has been replaced by a stone one. Kashgar-Irkeshtam. —In July the Russian consul at Kashgar stated that Tele g ra P h8 - the Russian Government were again pressing for the junction of the telegraph lines at Kashgar and Irkeshtam. In December the request was said to have been refused. In March the “ Turkistan News” reported that Professor Marzbacher was at Travels - Kulja, prospecting for gold. Captain Shuttleworth, who relieved Mr. Macartney on the latter proceed ing on leave to Europe, travelled to Kashgar by the Hunza route accompanied by Captain Cheape, and arrived there on the 18th June. Leaving Gilgit on the 28th May, he crossed the Mintaka Pass on the 6th, reached Tashkurghan on the 10th, and left for Kashgar on the 12th June. On the 12th September he left Kashgar for Yarkand where be arrived on the 16th September ; leaving this place on the 2nd November he reached Khargalik on the 5th, and remained here to the llth, arriving back at Kashgar on the 23th November. Captain Cheape went on to Aksu, arrived there on the 18th July, returned to Kashgar on the 28th August, and left it on the 8th September for India via Tashkurghan and the Kilik Pass. Mr. Macartney proceeded on furlough to England on the 30th June, travelled home via the Turgat route to Narin and thence by tarantass, via Pishpek and Chimkent, to Aris, on the Tashkent railway. Lieutenant H. Whitaker, Rifle Brigade, arrived at Kashgar on the 6th July from England and St. Petersburg via Hi and Aksu. He was accom panied by a Caucasian named Grigor Makandarof, a shikari. He left Kashgar for India via Yarkand and Leh on the LSth July. At the end of November information was received of the intended despatch from San Francisco on the 10th November of an American expedition under Mr. D. C. Sowers, Magnetic Observer of the Department of Terrestrial Magnet ism of the Carnegie Institute, across China to Chinese Turkistan. A few days later the Foreign Office reported that a second American ex pedition to Eastern Turkistan under Mr. Frank Meyer, Agricultural Explorer of the Department of Agriculture, U.S.A., was being organised and expected to arrive there early in January 1909. Mr. Meyer is accompanied by Dr. Saunders of Ottawa. On the 23rd September, in compliance with a request from the Japanese Consul General, permission was accorded by the Government of India to two Japanese, MM- Zuisho Tachibama and Eizaburo Nomura, to enter India from Kashgar by the Karakoram and Leh route. They were expected to reach Kashgar about the end of November and remain there or at Yarkand for the winter. These Japanese are ostensibly coming to India for the purpose of making investigations into matters of religious interest, but, as they are in com munication with a compatriot, M. A. Ama, whose movements in Kashmir during■Hi 40 the summer aroused suspicion, they are believed to be intelligence agents, No news of their movements had reached Kashgar by the end of the year. Dr. M. Aurel Stein continued his archaeological explorations in Chinese Turk is tan until the middle of September when he left for India. During his stay in the country Dr. Stein has covered an immense area of ground, and collected an enormous quantity of antiques and ancient manuscripts, while his assistants have surveyed some 17,000 square miles of country. The 1907 Summary left him at the Mingoi ruins near Karashahr. The New Year found him at Korla where, however, his explorations yielded little of interest. Thence early in January a move was made in a south-westerly direction to the desert belt, north of the Inchiki river. Here an eight days’ halt was made and the ground carefully surveyed, after which Dr. Stein moved by forced marches across unsurveyed ground to Kuchar where he arrived on the 17th January. Several extensive groups of ruined cave temples in this neighbourhood attested the flourishing condition of Buddhism during the centuries preceding the con version to Islam. But the numerous expeditions which have visited this spot in the course of the last five years and the recent Drench Mission under Profes sor Pelliot had made a thorough clearance of all old manuscripts. So after a week’s halt Dr. Stein resumed his journey to the south of the desert. He arrived at Tungaz-Basti on the Keriya Diver on the 16th February after a long and trying march. Thence a new route was followed to the desert edge, north of Domoko, where excavations were rewarded by valuable finds of well preserved manuscripts and Buddhist paintings. March and early April w r ere spent in archaeological labours along the desert belt adjoining the oasis from Domoko to Khotan. By the 12th of the latter month Stein had explored Islamabad on the Khotan river, whence he proceeded to Mazartagh a 4 days’ march. Here he was rejoined by Bai Lai Singh who had in the meantime completed a detailed survey of previously unmapped ground in the north-west and north of the Khotan Oasis, and the party set out for Aksu by the desert route along the Khotan river bed. Aksu was reached on the 30th April after an arduous march and arrange ments were made for a continuous survey along the outer Tian Shan Bange west wards as far as the passes above Kashgar. Dr. Stein himself travelled up the Uch-Turfan Valley and thence marched by a route, not shown on published maps, across a barren mountain ranee to Kelpin. Here sufficient archaeological evidence w as secured to prove that this tract, once traversed by the ancient high road to Kashgar, had been occupied down to the 8th century A.D by a large settlement, to which canals, still traceable in parts, carried water from the Kashgar river. A rapid journey via Yarkand brought the party by the middle of June back to Khotan. After 6 weeks of constant toil at Khotan Dr. Stein, by the end of July, was rejoined by Dai Lai Singh who had completed his survey of the foot of the Tian Shan from Aksu to Kashgar and the southern slopes of the Kuen Lun range w^est of Khotan. From here Dai Lai Singh had to be sent to the Swedish Mission at Yarkand owing to the state of his eyes; his case was, however, hopeless and he left Yarkand for India on the 14th July. On 1st August Dr. Stein started for the sources of the Yurung Kash (or Khotan) river, intending to approach the head waters from the east, as explorations in 1900 and 1906 had proved them inaccessible for the w est. After passing through the difficult Folu Gorge and turning westwards, he reached the Zailik valley which drains into the Yurung Kash. Thence he crossed the watershed of the Keriya river on the 18th September into the valley of the easternmost feeder of the Kara Kash. Here Dr. Stein became incapacitated for further work by frost-bite which necessitated proper medical treatment. He accordingly travel led as rapidly as possible to Leh, where Dr. Schmitt of the Moravian Mission operated on his right foot. Lieutenant-Colonel Lieutenant-Colonel Kozlof’s expedition to Mongolia, of wFich mention is S 0 M 0 o:; S on: xpediti0nmade 0n P a S e 37 of the 1907 Summary, left Kyakhta, as originally intended, on the 10th January after three weeks’ halt for final preparations at that place. Lieutenant*Colonel Kozlof is accompanied by a geologist, a botanist and a topo grapher in addition to 10 soldiers and guides. From Kyakhta the Shan-Khad or Yellow Mountain route was followed to Urga, where the expedition divided into two parties. Onepioceeded direct to Alashan Yamin, wbile the other underLieutenant-Colonel Kozlof left Urga on the 7th Eehruary in the direction of the Tola river. Thence it crossed the Ulin Davan Pass into the valley of Lake Tukhun Nor and, then striking south, followed the valley of the TJngun Gol to the Gurban Saikhat (or Saikan) Mountains which were crossed by passes between the middle and the western ranges. Thence it was proposed to proceed via Khara Khoto and the Etsingol Elver to Alashan Yamin. A comprehensive study of the country between the Etsingol valley and the Goitso showed that, though marked on the maps as a series of oases, it is in reality a rocky barren desert. The Etsingol Eiver was found to have left its old bed and now flows into the goo*o and Gashun Nor lakes, which were found to he very similar in character to °the Lob Nor. Early in May the expedition arrived at Eu-Mu-Eu, a town west of the Alashan Eange, where the two parties reunited and a meteorologi cal station was established. The Alashan Range and the Valley of the Huang- Ho were surveyed, and when last heard of preparations were being made lor the onward journey to Szechuan and the exploration of the basin of the Koko Nor. Commercial. In August 1907, as mentioned on page 37 of the Annual Summary for that year, the Kashgar Taotai was endeavouring to rouse the enthusiasm of the lead- ino* merchants at Kashgar over the development of the mineral resources of the country. His proposals, however, met with little response and, had it not been for pressure from the authorities at Urumchi, the matter would in all probabili ty have been allowed to drop. The innate inability of the Kashgaris to com bine in any movement of this sort is in the main responsible for the luke warmness with which the scheme has been greeted. Some progress, ne\ erthe- less, has been made. In February it w r as stated that the Taotai had engaged on a yearly salary of £790 a Russified German engineer whose duty it would be to act as general adviser to the Chinese iu mining matters. He was expected to reach Kashgar in May. On the 2Sth July, however, Captain Shuttleworth reported the arrival there of four Russian mining engi neers who had, it was stated, received appointments in connection with the Trading Company. Two of them proceeded to Khotan to investigate an alleged 0 discovery at Nia in the Keriya District of platinum which proved to be nickel, and the other two were to go to Turfan. In October M. A. R Stoyanof, one of the Russian geologists, returned to Kashgar and reported that discoveries of gold had been made near Yoroktash, Yolchin and Achma, south-east of Khotan, of large deposits of magnetic iron near Tam-Oghil and Bokodong, of grey jade near Kumat, 30 miles south-east of Khotan, and of rose-quartz, a few miles south of Gurchak, But no coal was found. A more popular move and one likely to have far-reaching consequences was started in June by the formation of the Kashgar Trade Guild which the Taotai had been endeavouring to found since November 1908. The object of this guild is apparently the boycott of foreign traders, if not of foreign goods, and it has already gained many adherents. The privileged position of foreigners in Kashgaria has for many years been a cause of complaint with the natives who are supported by the Chinese officials. During the past year Mr. Macartney has noticed an attitude of increased self-assertiveness on the part of the latter and indications that the time is not far distant when the Chinese will demand a readjustment of the conditions of foreign trade in Kashgaria. The guild, however, has made little progress owing to the disputes amongst its members. Owing to the dislocation of business in Russia and the desire of manufac turers to get rid of superfluous stocks at any cost, large exports on long credit of Russian cotton piece-goods were made in 1907 to Kashgar with the result that the bazar was glutted.

Foreign Relations. In April 1908, the Political Officer in Sikkim was shewn a letter addressed by the Chinese Amban to the Maharaja of Bhutan. The letter stated that Bhutan was under Chinese suzerainty and that the Amban was sending an officer to report on the state of the country. At the same time the Maharaja received a letter from Ma Chi Pu, late Popon of Pipitang, saying that he had been sent by the Amban to inspect the country, and ordering the Barons and Penlops to attend at the boundaries of their fiefs to conduct the Popon through. The Maharaja asked Ugyen Kazi’s advice on the matter, and that official recommended him to point out to the Amban that China lent no assistance to the Bhutanese when the country was at war with England, that Bhutan had never paid tribute to China, nor had any of her officials been paid by China. Ma Chi Pu left for Bhutan on March 3th and was detained at Paro by orders of the Paro Penlop, pending the orders of the Maharaja. Finally the Maharaja wrote to Ma Chi Pu saying that he was at that time busy making roads and could not meet the Chinese agent, that the question of making an enquiry into the condition and resources of the country would have to be referred to a full'council of Bhutanese nobles, that it was unnecessary for Ma Chi Fu to visit Punakha, and that his visit would only entail hardship on the people. Ma Chi Pu was thus obliged to return. BURMA. Communications. In August 1903 the Secretary of State for India approved of the Govern 4 ment of India’s proposals for the building of the Bhamo-Tengyueh Railway. These proposals provide that the line is to be built from Bhamo ’to the Chinese Frontier by the Government of India, and the remainder by the “ British and Chinese Corporation,” who will receive the necessary railway concession from the Chinese Government, and an advance of £10,000 for preliminary expenses from the Indian revenues. At the end of the year this matter was still pending. Political. Internal. On the 12tb September the Government of Burma reported that Messrs. Dickie and Bennet, two Englishmen in the Shan States, had made an unautho rised visit into the Wa States. On their return they were warned against entering the tract again. Mr. Bennet reported that at the Wa village of Yak long he saw the head of a German, whom he had last seen in the spring of 1907. Mr. Bennet also stated that he saw rifles, of the Krag-Jorgensen pattern, being transported in considerable quantities through the Wa States to China. Foreign Relations. With regard to the Chinese party, which in 1907 visited the country aboi me N mai-Hka and then returned to Yunnan, information was received in Apr that they had visited the villages of Lang-su and Tzu*chu-pa, and further tffi ey ad informed various headmen that the boundary between Burma an China would mfuture be marked by the Chippwe Hka.In July 1908 permission was given to the Burma Government to begin the collection of transport for the proposed tour of a British officer in the N’mai- Hka tracts, which was postponed from 1907. This tour has since been abandoned. CHINA. Resources. During the year 1907 China’s foreign trade partially recovered from the Foreign Tr.de of depression that followed the Russo-Japanese war. The recovery would have Chi,la • been more complete but for the fact that throughout the Empire the price of food has been high, due to the many local risings that marked the year.

The South Manchuria Railway authorities have decided to spend 5 J million f m1 ,, oveine Dt of yen on the improvement of Tairen (Dalny) Harbour, the work to be extended Tair6n H '‘ rbour - over 4 years. During 1907 a method of deepening the Taku Bar by raking was success- ^ dee p eRin g 0 f fully tried. The channels dug by this means have given two to three feet of tte Taka Bw. additional water. The Chinese merchants of Chi-fu, finding a large amount of their trade improvement 0 f was being diverted to Kiau-chou, have lately determined to take steps to Chi ' fa Harbour, prevent further decrease of the shipping and have decided to improve Chi- fu harbour.

The line survey was completed early in the year. The line will run via Ma-tao shan, Chuan- yuan-kow, San-taoTing-tzu and Tao-ling-tzu. Little work has been done during the year. A few railway stations have been built. Progress has been considerable. Con struction trains run half way through the Nan*kou Pass. The road bed has been completed to within a short distance of Kalgan. The piers of all the bridges have been built. The Chinese Board of Communica tions has ordered a railway survey to be made from Kalgan to Kiachta via Kwi-hua-cheng and Urga. They also propose to build a branch line from Kalgau to J ehol. Work has been commenced. The railway is being built by means of an Anglo-German loan, but the control of the line is to be in Chinese hands. The German portion will be from Tientsin to the Southern border of Shan-tung, and the British portion through Kiang- su to Pakou. Roughly one-third of the capital is British and two- thirds German. Has been opened as far as Si-shui. Is being constructed by the Chinese Government. The capital has been found by a British Corporation, the Chinese Government having pledged the surplus earnings of the Imperial Railways of North China as security. Was opened to the public on April 3rd. The line is 194 miles long. Opened for traffic on April 20th. Has been constructed by the Kiang- su Provincial Railway Company. Length about 20 miles.

A new Chinese company has been iormed and has received the con cession. It will link the French Yunnan line and the Hankow— Ssu chuan Kailway. Shipping. The Central Government issued orders in May 1908 to the China ^ er ' ste ^ e “ 8ervic “ a6t chants’ Steam Navigation Company to start a regular steamship service from Shanghai to An-tung, Chi-fu, Tairen, Neuchuang, Tientsin, and other places on the Chinese coast, in order to compete with the Japanese. The Russian Duma passed a bill in July to subsidise a regular steam- Russian steamship ship service to run between Vladivostock and Tsuruga and between Wadi- tei ' ice * vostock and Shanghai. The service is to be run by the Volunteer Fleet. The South Manchurian Kailway commenced a regular steamship service 6 J^ between Shanghai and Tairen on August 10th, 1908. A Chinese company was formed in July to establish a steamship se ^ lC0 Bte ^p a ^e gP ° between Shanghai and Ning-po. Telegraphs. In June an Imperial Edict was published autliorising the purchase of the the Chinese 'I shares of the Chinese Telegraphic Company and the nationalisation ot the gritph8 , inland telegraph lines in China. For this purpose the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank have made the Chinese Government a loan of laels 1,000,uuu. of Tele-Wi'deis grapby. 46 Tele- A scheme for the installation of wireless telegraphy along the whole coast of China has been occupying the attention of Government, and a certain amount of progress has been made. In May the Viceroy of Kuangtung received orders to establish wireless telegraphic communication with the coast of Jfuh-kien, and in the same month the Viceroy of the Liang-kiang obtained permission to replace the cable between Wu-sung and Tsungming Island by wireless telegraphy. Naval. Reorganisation the Navy. Establishment of a Ministry of Marine. Training of officers. of The Chinese Ministry of War has decided that the New Chinese Navy shall consist of three squadrons, namely: —the Peiyang or Northern Fleet with bases at Chi-fu and Taku; the Nan-yang or Southern Fleet with bases at Chusan and Nimrod Sound; the Yueh-yang or Cantonese Fleet with bases at Nan-tien and San-mun Bay. Each fleet is to be composed of one battleship fifteen cruisers, and a number of gunboats, torpedo boats, and submarines. The new Navy is to he in charge of a Ministry of Marine, which is to be established in Peking. Meanwhile measures are being taken to train officers in modern methods. Six Chinese midshipmen have been attached to the British Navy, and it has been, decided to send naval cadets to Japan and Europe to complete their train ing. The Naval College at Tientsin is to reopen, and will be divided into two parts, preparatory and medium. Chinese Naval League. Cantonese River Fleet. A Naval League is also in course of formation, and it is stated that many contributions have already come in. West The fleet for the partrolling of the West Biver has been augmented by the purchase of four gunboats suitable for river work, and a large number of quickt- firing and machine guns. Military. Strength Reformed Army. of the At the end of 1907 the strength of the Lu-chm, or Peformed Chinese Chinese Army, amounted to 8 complete divisions, 16 mixed brigades, and 3 independent regiments, stationed for the most part in the north of China. Several units have been added to the army during 1908, the most notable additions being in Kashgaria and Mongolia, where the Chinese have been raising local troops and drilling them on modern lines. It is now stated that 10 complete Divisions exist in north China. Formation of Palace Guard. A palace guard, consisting of 6 battalions of infantry and 1 battalion of police, is at present in formation in Peking. Two battalions of infantry and the police, battalion have been in existence Jfor some time, and recruiting for the remainder is being pushed forward. As soon as the training of these units is sufficiently far advanced the protection of the two Imperial palaces will he entrusted to them, and the regular troops now employed on that duty will be set free for work with their divisions. In June the Ministry of War announced the intention of Government to raise an Imperial Guard, organised and trained on modern lines, consisting entirely of members of the Imperial clan. Reorganisattcn of An Imperial Edict, published on February 2nd, ordered the reorganisation angse roop., 0 f a qYangtse valley troops and the formation of a £t Yangtse valley Defence Army.” Tuan Feng, Viceroy of the two Kiang provinces, obtained permission in June to raise four new brigades to bring the number of the troops at his disposal of his viceroyalty. ordered 72 field guns and several machine guns from Germany. stated that he hasThe reorganisation of ihe troops in Kuang-tung has proceeded hut slowly Reorganisation of during the course of the year, owing largely to lack of funds. Lately, however, J r e myi K ^ n s tun s orders have been sent to the Cantonese Viceroy to proceed more energetically in the raising of troops ; and some signs of activity are noticeable. ^ ^ A programme of augmentation of the Lu-chun for the next few years has Augmentation, been laid dowm by the Ministry of War, and comprises the raising of 26 divi sions by the end of 1912. This is to be effected as follows :— In 1909. Two divisions are to be raised, one in Cheh-kiang and one in Fuh-kien. In 1910. Fourteen Divisions, viz., three in Manehuria ; one in Turkes tan ; one in Shansi ; one in Shensi ; two fn Kiang*su; one in Shantung ; two in Hu-peh and three in Ssu chuan. In 1911. Six divisions. In 1912. Six divisions. A scheme is at present being considered by the Ministry of War for the Eemount3 - buying of remounts. The depot at Dolon Nor is to be greatly enlarged, and horses°are to be bought in Mongolia and formed into large droves of 20 , 000 . The Yunnan Reformed Army consists at present of 7 battalions of Infan* strcngUi^of^ the try and 6 batteries of Mountain artillery. They are distributed as follows :— Arm y 111 At Yunnan-fu.—3 battalions of Infantry, 5 batteries of Mountain artillery. At Mengtse—1 battalion of infantry (Cantonese), 1 battery of Mountain artillery. At Kai-hua.—1 battalion of Infantry. At Teng-yueh—2 battalions of infantry. The nominal fighting strength of the battalion, or ying, of infantry is 522 of all ranks, and of a battery of artillery 125 men and 6 guns.

The old arsenal is to he given up to the manufacture of heavy ordnance. The British Consul-General, writing from Cheng-tu, reports that recruits are being brought in from all over the pro vince, and that the men are well armed, well clothed, and well behaved. The Imperial Edict, published on September 15th, 1907, ordering the for- Organisation of the mation of a provincial police force, in order to relieve the regular army of all t ^j u0 ^ Hsun ' Fa,ng ' civil duties, is being carried into effect rapidly. The men are to be uniformly armed and clothed in each province, and are to take part in manoeuvres once in every two years. Like the regular army they are organised in battalions and squadrons, and in event of war are to be placed at the disposal of the military authorities for local defence.48 Political. Foreign Relations. On February 2nd the Chinese authorities seized the Japanese vessel li Tatsu Mam*’ as she was about to unload a quantity of arms and ammnniti n near Macao. The Japanese Government forced China to pay an indemnity of £2,140 for the seizure of this vessel. Japan’s action with regard to the “ Tatsu Maru ,! caused widespread indigna tion throughout China, and a boycott of Japanese trade was started by a strong body of Chinese merchants. This boycott was still partially in force in Southern China at the end of 1908. Restoration to In May Russia restored to China 60 villages which are situated on the c hi e n * o£ Aamt Vil ' Amur River in the Aigun district and which were occupied during the war. Patrol! ns of the The patrolling of the West River by British gunboats, which was men- Britain. iverbyGreat tioned in last year’s summary of events, caused greaJ indignation among the Chinese, and a boycott was threatened. All British boats, however, w T ere withdrawn by the middle of January, the conditions demanded by England having been satisfied. New Russian Con. The Russian Duma has approved the establishment of Consulates-General 8ulate8 ' at Harbin and Mukden, Consulates at Kirin, Tsi-tsi-hai and Tairen, and a Vice- consulate at Kuang-cheng-tzu. Internal Relations. General. During the year the reform movement in China has continued, and the Government have occupied themselves chiefly with the suppression of opium smoking, the improvement of education, and the organisation of Provincial Assemblies with a view to the establishment of a National l arliament in Peking. The feeling of “ China for the Chinese ” has been growing steadily, and a strong animus against the use of foreign capital or foreign employes exists throughout the country. The Rehellion in A serious outbreak of an anti-dynastic character occurred in Yunnan in May. On May 1st a body of revolutionaries, who had collected in French territory, suddenly appeared before Ho-k’ou, a Chinese frontier town, and with the aid of some of the garrison captured the place and beheaded the local official. After the capture the revolutionary general published several proclamations in French, assuring foreigners that their lives and property were in no danger, and that all existing treaties and foreign agreements would be respected. He further stated that the object of the Revolutionaries was the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty. Leaving Ho-k’ou the revolutionaries marched north, by three roads, on the town of Mengtse, being joined on the way by the troops of the Taotai’s deputy and by those stationed at Nam-hsi. The news of the outbreak reached Yunnan-fu on May 4th. The Viceroy Hsi-liang, gathering - together a force of 5,000 men, of whom 2,000 were modern drilled, marched against the rebels, and by May 16th was able to report that the revolutionary army had been defeated on all three routes. Ho- k’ou was captured shortly afterwards, and the movement gradually died out. v The numbers of the rebels was estimated at about 5,000, of whom about 1,000 were armed with rifles. Revolutionary The brewing of another revolutionary storm was reported by the British ern V Y™nnan. 1U WfBfc * Consul in Teng-yueh on September 16th, 190S. It appears that the Taotai of Teng-yueh, Chin, and the Commandant of the Teng-yueh troops, Chang- Tsung-ching, had planned an outbreak for November. The Viceroy, however, was warned by our consular authorities, and keimmediately replaced TaotaiChin by a new Taotai, who is doing all he can to avert the outbreak. Com mandant Chang’s resignation was accepted, and 250 foreign drilled soldiers were despatched from Yunnan-fu to leng-yueh. An anti-Catholic riot broke out in May at Yung-shang in the An-hin pro- Minor risings, vince The buildings of the Homan Catholic Mission, as well as the district magistrate’s yamen, were burnt down. Troops had to he despatched to the spot to quell the rioters. In the same month two other small risings occurred at Chao-an and Ma- chia-hsiang in Euh-kien, but were quickly suppressed by the local general. At the end of 1907 Cheh-kiang was reported as being in a very disturbed state. At Kia-hsing the crowd burnt down the local official’s yamen and a Protestant church and school. So serious did the rioting become that ^ the Imperial authorities issued orders for the despatch of a division to the province, hut finally countermanded the order on representation from the provincial officials that the local troops were sufficient, Eebellion has been rife throughout the year in Kuang-si. The insurgents, iQ who belong chiefly to anti-dynastic societies, are armed with modern rifles, and are said to be treating the inhabitants so well as to gain their approval. The Governor of Kuang-si has obtained permission to remove the capital Ca T . r t ^j afl ^ ^ f uan tll g e i of his province from Kuei-lin to Nan-ning. The former town is very open to t 0 a Nau-ning. ua ^ attack and a dangerous residence in troublous times. In June the Viceroy of Yun-kuen memorialised the throne proposing Tiie Chinese Shan that, as the Sawbwa of the Shan State of Cheng-kang had died without direct ^ a es ‘ heir, the opportunity should be seized of bringing Cheng-kang under regular Chinese jurisdiction. Up to the end of 1908 no steps had been taken to carry out this proposal, as the Teng-yueh Taotai, in return for a bribe of Taels 3,000, given by the Sawbwas of Nan-tien, Kanai, and Lu-chiang, reported un favourably on the project. The Emperor Kuang-hsu died on November 14th, 1908, after a long illness, rei ^ a ^ h un &lt; ^^g u ^“{ and the Dowager Empress on the following day. No disturbances followed, ot - the Dowager precautions being immediately taken to patrol the streets of Peking. Prince Em P iess ' Pu-wei, the two year old son of Prince Chun, was selected as his successor, with Prince Chun as regent. Prince Chun, though he has promised reform, has hitherto been looked, upon as a leader of the conservative party. INDO-CHINA. Harbours. The Government of Indo-China have set aside a sum of 11,200 dollars for improvement of improvements to the Haiphong docks. It has been decided to carry out the the Haiphong Dock, following w T orks. (1) The lengthening of the actual dock’s wall and the broadening of it, so that it may take a metre-gauge railway, (2) The building of a port railway station in the docks. (3) The building of a refitting dock, which is to be 140 metres in length.50 Line. Proposed ways. Tbe garrison Indo China. Communications. Raihcays.

It has been decided to give machine guns to the Infantry. Each battalion Distribution of in Indo-China, European as well as native, is to have a group consisting of maclllae suus ' • two guns attached to it ; the latter are to receive the machine guns first. In Cochin China only two of the European battalions quartered there are to be armed with machine guns. Political. Foreign Relations. In May a body of Chinese troops, in pursuit of the Chinese rebels Fr ^ lti ^j^.£t” eBe defeated at Ho-k’ou, crossed the Tonkin frontier and fired upon a party of Tirailleurs Tonkinois, killing a French Lieutenant and six native soldiers. China apologised to France for this incident, paid 250,000 francs compensation to the families of those killed, and made good some loss which had been ineui’- red by the Haiphong-Yunnan-fu Kail way Company. Several hands of the Chinese Keformists defeated at Ho-k’on retreated chinese R £ormist into French territory. On June 18th 150 Tirailleurs Tonkinois, under two 111 Sla 011 1U ' French lieutenants, captured some 150 Chinese Keformists at a place called Yen-Binh-Xa, 50 miles due east of Laokai. During the following night the French force was surrounded and practically wiped out by the main body of the band to which their prisoners belonged. The two French lieutenants were amongst the killed. On the 21 st June the Keformists advanced on Yen-Binh-Xa and sent a demand to the Commandant to he allowed to pass. Permission being refused they opened fire, but were beaten off. The Chinese then dispersed into the hills. They have now divided into two parties, and have not yet been disposed of. They are being harried by armed partisans of the Man tribe; movement being difficult for regular troops at the time of the year. Mixed detachments of the Foreign Legion and the Tirailleurs Tonkinois guard the main routes and rivers and prevent the escape of the Keformists. The ea«e with which the Chinese Kevolutionaries crossed and recrossed P 0 S^™I^Hiciug the frontier has led the French to appoint a commission to consider means for of the Frontier, its better policing. Internal Relations. Towards the end of March grave disturbances broke out in Annam. At Ai ^ h a ® n Uare8t in Fai-foo a crowd of about 3,000 Annamese malcontents attempted to break into mi 1 ' the French Residency. Large demonstrations took place in other parts, but were easily dealt with by the militia. The causes were first stated to be the imposition of the new poll tax and the extortionate ways of the Mandarins, but the movements had a distinct anti-European tone. The trouble has now been suppressed at the European centres, but the interior of the country is still in a very disturbed state.52 Murder of two On June ?4th two British subjects, Messrs. Pearby and Sutherland, who subjects. prospecting, were, murdered up-country by Chinese pirates acting in collusion with the villagers among whom they were staying. Poisoning conspi* On June 28th an attempt was made to poison the European garrison of racy at Hanoi. ji ano i. The plot which seems to ha ve originated among the compagnie des ouvriers indigenes of the artillery, failed of its purpose, all the victims re covering from the effects of the poison. Various .groups of natives, evidently by preconcerted arrangement, assembled on the outskirts of the town, and larger bands are said to have been waiting further outside. The military and police authorities had however received information that something was on foot, and as soon as the poisoning attempt was known, the ringleaders were arrested and the native guards replaced by Europeans. S everal native non-commissioned officers, who were convicted of having taken part in this plot, were executed, and others were sentenced to imprison ment. On June 30th, some three hundred of the French population of Hanoi marched to the Residency, forced the guard, and demanded that the Governor General should take immediate steps to assure the safety of Europeans. The Rising in A small rising occurred in Battambang during May, fomented by Battambang. Siamese malcontents who objected to French occupation. The Europeans were obliged to take refuge in the buildings of the Bank of Indo-China. Troops were despatched to the new provinces, and order was established without incident. The First Tonk : - The first Tonkinese Consultative Chamber was opened at Hanoi on the mm her Coasultlve Hth November 1907. The Paris correspondent of the “Times ” states that the result of this measure has been to create a feeling of unrest among the Ton kinese, and that the forming of this Council has been strongly opposed by the older French residents in Tonkin. racoity and Piracy The Colonial papers have complained bitterly throughout the year of the in indo-china. prevalence of dacoity and piracy in Annam and Tonkin, and of the inadequate measures taken by the authorities to reduce it. JAPAN. Harbours, Yokohama Harbour. During the year the improvements being carried out in Yokohama harbour have been progressing. It is expected that the work will be finshed by 1912. Keeiung Harbour. The improvement works in Keelung harbour are being rapidly carried out- It is estimated that by the end of 1908 the quays will be so far completed as to allow small vessels getting alongside. There is a uniform depth of 30 feet along the quays and in the anchorage. Takow Harbour. The Government of Formosa have sanctioned the expenditure of yen 4,733,000 (£ 473,300) on improvements to Takow harbour. The work is to be carried out w ithin 6 years. Fortresses. Fortification of halien. The Japanese have built extensive fortifications in Saghalien. They have fortified the shore of Eniwa Bay as far as the Crillon light-house and the straits of La Perouse, and are making an anchorage for a torpedo-boat flotilla. Roads leading from Korsa Korski to the centre of the district have been broad ened and metalled. Fort Korsa Korski has been turned into a second-class for tress with a harbour for large cruisers.

A torpedo station has been set up at Makung, Military. According to the Militar WochenbUtt oi August 1st 1908, the Japanese tha Government have decided to increase the infantry by 8 regiments which are to be numbered from 65 to 72 inclusive. The independent cavalry are also to he increased by two brigades. This augmentation is to he effected by the withdrawal of the third squad ions from the divisional cavalry, which experience during the war proved to he too strong for mere protective purposes. On the other hand it was found that the inde pendent cavalry were always too weak when opposed to the Russian horse. Six horse artillery batteries are to be formed, and groups of two batteries attached to each of the now existing cavalry brigades. A balloon section was formed during the course of the year in Tokyo. The personnel were drawn from 1 st (Tokyo) and 14th (Utsonimiya) Divisions. Among other things, the men were instructed in photography. The whole of the artillery were armed with a new field gun (model 39 nen) Ee £Xy nt ° f ^ by the end of August. Captain Woodroffe, who attended the practice with the new field gun of the Guards Artillery Regiment in October last, reports that the ammunition is the same as that used with the old field gun, the cartridge and shell being separate. The range of the new gun is 7,350 metres and the fuze will burn up to 6,000 metres. The existing rifle is being altered. The holt has been improved and also A1 Ktry Rifle. tho the shape of the'hullet, the latter change increasing the effective range to 2,400 metres (2,620 yards.)

Operations against the aborigines of Formosa have been continued da ring the year. In February last it was stated that about a third of the island had hetm brought under control. The population of the remainder was estimated at about 30,000 ; and against them a body of 5,000 Aiyu, led by 600 Japanese officers and non-commissioned officers, were employed. The advance began in April, and was carried out from three directions; one in the north, one in the centre and one in the south. Regular troops were not employed, though every arrangement was made for their use, had it become necessary. Little fighting took place; the operations were everywhere successful; and about 190 square miles of fresh country was occupied.

The Japanese force was further reinforced in May by the arrival of the remaining brigade of the 12th Division. The total Japanese force in Korea at the end of 1908 amounted to two divisions (the 12th and 13th), 4 squadrons of cavalry, and 2,000 gendarmes. Besides this force there were 1,700 Japanese and 3,057 Korean police. MALAY PENINSULA. Harbours. Wharf and dock The Tanjong Pagar Dock Board at the end of 1907 accepted a tender for e °si t nipo 0 re. in the construction of a main wharf and lagoon dock at a contract price of £998,700. The work comprises 4,575 feet of wharfage, with a depth of 85 feet at low water. The lagoon dock is to have 3,800 feet of wharfage with a depth of 30 feet at low water. Railicays. Proposed Railway The Federated Malay States have decided on the building of a line of rail from Qemas, Negri Sembilan, to Kuala Semantan, 1’alang.The first train of the Singapore-Penang Railway ran through on September Th^smgapore-Pan. 6 th 1908.

The formation of this company was brought about by an agreement to which the North German Lloyd came with Japanese owmers of the Bangkok- Hong-Kong-Swatow Service. Military. The strength of the Singapore Volunteer Corps in February 1908 was 642. Tto Si» g .po» v.i- Out of that number 83 were Malacca cadets and 153 Singapore cadets. Ihe numbers in the units were S.

In July a through service of trains between Beauport and Limbawang Borneo Rail- was commenced, the trains running twice daily. Railway communication has been established between Manila and the tb8 1,111 naval station of Cavite, the length of the line being about 23 miles. Military.

Batteries armed with 6 -inch guns are to be erected on the islands of Puolo Cabalo, Corregidor and d hi Iruile. Ihe land side is to be defended by a series of forts and floating batteries on the big lake. The American authorities are trying the experiment of importing Anstra- tralian' horses into lian horses into the Philippines for the use of the troops, but the experiment the Philippines, so far has not proved a success. In the early part of the year heavy shipments of ammunition, mines, and Mnnitionsof warfor torpedoes, were despatched to Manila, it being intended to collect a 5 years supply before the arrival of the American Fleet. The garrison of the Philippines was increased in January by the arrival rison of the Philip- of nine companies of the 1st Cavalry and two companies of the 6 th. These pines, troops are to be stationed at Lujon. It was announced in December 1907 that the first troops to be armed with troops mthe phi- tbe New Springfield rifle would be those in Cuba and the Philippines. lippine Foreign Relations. The port of Davao, in the south-east of the island of Mindanao in the j&gt;yijppj nes . Moro Province, Philippine Islands, was opened to foreign trade from July 1st 1908. At the same time the ports of Jurata and Sitanki were closed.Bridges built in Nepal. Proposed Forest Tramway. Bequest for arms and machinery. Booruiting for the Indian Army. NEPAL. Communications. During the year 1907*1908, communications in Nepal have been improved by the building of several bridges. The following bridges were built:— (а) On the Katmandu-Chowbahar road:—a lattice girder bridge across the Balkhu stream. ( б ) On the Katmandu-Pharphing road :—a lattice girder bridge across the Bagmatti Biver, near Nakhoo in the Nepal Valley. (A suspension bridge has also been erected over the Bagmatti River on the hill road to Pharphing.) (c) On the Katmandu-Segowlie road:—(1) A lattice girder bridge across the Samri River; (2) A lattice girder bridge across the Kurroo River. The wooden bridges at Bhaisadubhan and Dhokapedi which are on this road and which are of cantilever type, are to be replaced by substantial iron ones. It is believed that the firm of Rattan Singh and Hakim Singh, Punjab, have obtained permission to build a forest tramway, 30 miles in length, through the State’s forests for the purpose of removing timber. Military. In September 1907 the Nepal Durbar asked permission to purchase from the Government of India 10,000 Martini Henry rifles, and to import certain machinery for the manufacture of arms and ammunition. They added that if the request for the arms were granted they would waive the demand for machinery. As regards the arms, the Government of India informed the Resident that they understood that the Durbar had, in 1906, estimated their immediate requirements at 5,000 rifles ; and 2,500 of these had been supplied in October of that year. The Government would give the Durbar a further 2,500 rifles now, but they did not think it advisable either to give or sell so large a number as 10,000 to Nepal at the moment when the Prime Minister was leaving for England, since some untoward situation might arise during his absence. They would however be prepared to consider the question on the Prime Minister’s return. On the 27th February the Nepal Durbar sent a letter of thanks to the Viceroy for this further gift of 2,500 rifles. On the 31st March the Secretary of State telegraphed the suggestion that it would be politic for the Government of India to inform the Prime Minister, before he started for England, that the balance of the 10,000 rifles asked for in September 1907 would be given to him on his return, since if the concession were only made subsequently it might be attributed to the intervention of the Home Government. Further, the promise of the arms now w 7 ould make Sir Chandra less anxious, while in England, to arrange with manufacturers, independently of Government, for the supply of arms and machinery for Nepal. The requisite promise was accordingly given to the Minister on the 5 th April. The supply of recruits for the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army has continued satisfactory, but the Prime Minister is viewing with alarm the strain put on the fighting classes by their enlistment in the Military Police, and advises some easement in this direction.Political. Internal. The Prime Minister of Nepal, Sir Chandra Shamshere Jang, vidted Nipai’^lS England during the year ; he remained there three months, and received a to England, G. C. B. External. The Nepalese Quinquennial Mission visited Peking this year. It was but coldly received by the Chinese. During its stay in Peking the Mission maintained the most friendly relations with the British Legation. In Eebruary 1908, reliable news was received from Tibet that Mr. Chang M J o ^ sit had sent a letter to the Nepalese Durbar, informing them that he would shortly visit the country to investigate the circumstances in which transport animals were supplied to the Indian Government during the Tibet Expedition of 1904i Presumably Mr. Chang’s recall to China prevented the carrying out of this plan. NETHERLANDS INDIES. Political. Internal. The Achinese war still continues. During the year risings against Dutch The Achinese w*r rule took place in the islands of Sumatra, Bali, Eloris, and Timor. In each case the rebels were dispersed. Taxation grievances appear to he the principal cause of unrest. SIAM. Barbours. A company of Siamese officials and Chinese merchants has been formed ill New dock for Bangkok for the building of a dock which it is proposed to excavate on the Bau e Lob ' west side of the river, opposite Samping. The most modern machinery is to he installed, and the dock is to be big enough to take any ship coming into the port. The business is to be under European management. Communications. Baihcays.

Bn Railway systems, Project fot linking ii ne j s practically a prolongation of the line from Bangkok to Tachin, which 1 u f p Sm;liese was j n 1905 by another private company. Towards the end of 1907 Lieutenant Colonel Mackenzie Foss submitted to the Foreign Office in London a scheme for linking up the existing Siamese State Kail way at Ban-Pang with a British line which would have its terminus at a port near the Tavoy River in Burma. The length of such a line would be about 125 miles, 65 of wdiich would be in British territory. The cost would be about £4i,900 per mile. After con sultation with the British Minister at Bangkok, the Foreign Office came to the conclusion that the time was inopportune tor the serious consideration of the project by the Siamese Government. Roads mai. Telegraphs Chieng-mai. Hoads. in chieng. A certain amount of progress has been made during the year in the con struction of roads in the Chieng-mai district. A good road is said to connect Chieng-mai with Prayao and one with Chieng-rai. Work is progressing on the section leading northwards from Chieng-mai to the Kengtung border, and several bridges, substantial enough for the passage of cattle, have been erected. The roads are unmetalled and would be difficult in rainy weather, and the gra dients are often steeper than necessary. Telegraphs. A telegraph line in the Chieng-mai district is under construction. Poles are already in position round the towns and along the easier parts of the route. The sums sanctioned, however, are inadequate, and the work is either badly done or proves burdensome to the local inhabitants, who have to provide corvee. Military. The new Conscription Law is working quietly. It has not yet been extend ed to the town of Bangkok itself, as no knowledge exists of its population ; and on this account it has been decided to take no steps in the matter until a census of the capital has been taken. the The British Minister reports that the status of the soldier has been consi derably improved and that the stigma formerly attached to the military calling is giving way to new sentiments of patriotism and esprit de corps. The men seem content and smart, and the officers possess enthusiasm. The Conscription Law fixes the term of service with the colours at 2 years and with the first reserve at five years, in which a maximum of 2 month’s train* ing a year has to be undergone. After the period in the first reserve the men are transferred to the second reserve, in which they remain till the age of TO, when all service ceases. The age of tnose serving with the colours is from 18 to 20 . / ry Eo^neering Mlhta '. The Ministry of Mar has decided to establish a school of military engineer ing, and two German and five French professors are to be engaged to impart instruction in military engineering and artillery.

SIKKIM. Political Internal. In February 1908 the Maharaja of Sikkim visited Calcutta, and had ra j atolK(i j a an interview with the Viceroy. TIBET. Geography. Dr. Sven Hedin, who left Leh in December 1907 on a journey of Dr. Sven Hedin. exploration, in Tibet made some important discoveries during the yeai. lie states that his chief achievements during the journey are :— (1) The discovery of the true sources of the Brahmaputra and Indus and the genetic source of the Sutlej east of the M ansorawar Lake. (2) The exploration of the province of Bongba. (3) The discovery of a continuous mountain chain running east and west through Tibet, the highest peaks of which are 4,000 or 5,000 feet lower than Everest, but whose passes average 3,000 feet higher than the Himalayan passes. A Frenchman, M. Bacot, made a 14 months’ journey in China during m. Bacot, the year, and penetrated a short distance into Eastern libet. He crossed the frontier near Ya-ka-lo and travelled as far as the Salween, when deficiencies of equipment obliged him to return. It was announced in January that an American scientific body bad deter- Dr. Laufer. mined to send Dr. Lanfer, an eminent Chinese scholar, on a three years expedi tion into Tibet. Colonel Kozloff, who left Moscow in November 1907, lias been exploring the Co]onel Kozloff&gt; Alashan mountains, and it is believed that be intends to penetrate to Kokonor and the north-eastern parts of Tibet He has a large escort with him that makes him independent of Chinese and Tibetan interference. Resources. Tibetan trade with India for the year 1907-1908 showed a very decided Tibetan traie with increase, which was due to a mild winter allowing caravans to cross the passes for a longer period than in former years. Twenty Tibetan students were sent during the year to Ckeng-tu, and a Despatch of number to India, to learn how to manufacture guns, glass, and other important™;^ studKnt8 articles of commerce.60 Com mimic a tion9.. The Batang-Lhasa telegraph. It was reported in December 1907 that a telegraph Hue had reached Batang, and that it showed signs of hurried and careless work. In February 1908 the Chinese Government ordered the extension of the line to Lhasa, but it soon became apparent that the success of such an undertaking was doubtful, and the project has been abandoned for the present. The telegraph. Gyantse After the evacuation of the Chumbi Valley, arrangements were made the Tibetan and Chinese officials for the protection of the telegraph line. In May, Captain Campbell reported that Mr. Chang was proposing to Chin'se Postal es ^ a ^i s ^ a postol service between India and Lhasa. He wished the Indian Post SemcTin Tibet. 08 a Office to hand over the mails at the Jelap La, whence they would be carried by the service couriers to Lhasa. Captain Campbell, commenting on the proposal, stated that the service would be slow, owing to the inadequate staff proposed, and that the Chinese officials would be certain to open official letters. \ Military, Chinese Attempts During the year the Chinese have continued to make attempts to reform Tibetan^Army. the the Tibetan Army. Ten Chinese drill instructors have been imported into Lhasa, and some have been sent to other places, such as Shigatse and Tungri. Besides these instructors it is reported that 14 cadets from the Ssu-chuan military college have arrived in Lhasa. Proposed Military It is further proposed to establish a military school in the capital, at which school in Lhasa. 20 soldiers and under-officers of the regular army, 39 Mongols, 10 Tibetans, 10 tribesmen, and 4 Gurkhas, will be trained annually. Proclamation con- In March a proclamation was issued by the Tibetan Government to the ron iD oVa e mXn Jon o s ' announcingt . he intention the Government to raise a Tibetan army Army. of 5,000 men, besides the already existing Chinese-taught troops and the militia. All able-bodied men not in definite employ were to be taken for service and the rate of pay was to be about Bs. 133 a year. The head-men were ordered to submit lists from which the War Office ‘would select men for service. Organ'zation of a Police. Strength ( liimse Tibet. of the troops ne In May the Amhan, with a view to tho establishment of a regular body of police for Lhasa, ordered the Tibetan authorities to select and train 12 men for the work of police organization. At the same time he established a police head-quarters of 100 men at Lhasa and caused the city to he regularly patrolled. It is difficult to give a correct estimate of the number of Chinese troops in Tibet, but the lafest reports state that there are 1,300 troops in Lhasa and 1,000 at Li-tang, of whom 3,800 are drilled on modern lines. Besides these there are said to be garrisons at Lamaya, Batang, and Chumbi. The number of Tibetan soldiers drilled by Chinese instructors is stated LLr,. 10 ,JC 3,000. all of whom are stationed in Lhasa. , In June the Chinese established a military post of an officer and 40 men at Aakcbuka, presumably with the intention of preventing Europeans from entering Lhasa from the north.

They carry these arms all over Tibet. It was reported in January that the Teling Eepon had been appointed of ^ T a rp^« Commander-in-Chief of the Tibetan Forces. The appointment is a new one and as Commander-in- it was probably given to the Teling Depon on account of his hostility to the chief ' British. He, however, did not live long to enjoy his exalted position for he died in September. It is improbable that another Commander-in-Chief will be appointed. Political. Foreign Relations, The vear has been marked by the continued growth of Chinese control Growth of Chinese 17 pp . power in Tibet. over Tibetan an airs. The power of the Chinese Amban is steadily growing, and as an instance of this the Nakchuka affair may be quoted. The Chinese Amban had given orders for the establishment of a Chinese military post at Nakchuka, and had informed the Tibetan authorities that they were to make the necessary arrange ments. The latter attempted to evade the matter by equivocation and delay, whereupon the Amban sent for them and threatened them with corporal punishment. The order was obeyed. The Political Officer in Sikkim was informed by Tibetan officials that they could not settle the smallest matters themselves without report to the Chinese. Throughout the year great friction seems to have existed between the Chinese and Tibetans, and several conflicts have occurred between the Tibetan and Chinese soldiery. The Amban has caused Lhasa to be patrolled daily by armed Chinese The Dalai Lama, who was reported as being at Hsin-ing in November 1907, arrived at Tai-yuan-fu on March 10th, 1908. From here he proceeded to the The Dalai Lama. TYu tai-shan monastery. During his protracted stay there he received several Europeans in audience, notably Mr. Rockhill, the United States Minister to Peking, to whom he complained bit terly of the ignorance in which the Chinese had kept him with regard to the Tibet Trade Regulations. Mr. Clementi of the Hong-Kong Civil Service, who also had an interview with him, reported that he had learnt from the commander of the Dalai Lama’s Chinese body-guard that a Russian had called and invited the Dalai Lama to stay in Russian territory, but that the Dalai Lama had declined on the score of offending the Chinese Government. By a decree dated July 19th the Dalai Lama was ordered to Peking for audience, and was finally induced to leave the Wu-tai-shan monastery in September. He arrived in Peking by train in September and w r as granted audience on September llth. One of the last acts of the Downger Empress was to confer an honorific title on the Dalai Lama and to grant him an annual salary of 10,000 taels. She at the same time commanded him to return to Tibet to take up his duties. In the early part of the year, Chao Erh-feng, formerly acting Viceroy of Appointment of Ssu-chuan, was appointed Resident in Tibet and Warden of the Western c!hao Erh ' fen g- Marches, and his brother, Chao Ehr-hsun, was made Viceroy of Ssu-chuan. The appointments are full of significance as to the policy which China intends to adopt towards Tibet. Chao Erh-feng is the official who so firmly repressed the Lama rising in Eastern Tibet in .1906, and he is considered an able and strong man. A memorial published by the Board of Einance on March 31st throws much light on the question. The appointment of the two brothers is to ensure harmony of action, and Ssu-chuan is expected to supply taels £00,000 (£60,000) (500,000) to Tibet. The functions Chao Erh-feng is expected to exercise appear to be very similar to those of the Marquess Ito in Korea, and especially with a view to the extension of Chinese control over Tibetan administration. Chao Erh-feng left Cheng-tu on September 30th to take up his duties. He was accompanied by 1,500 soldiers and a body-guard of 200 men.62 Fracas at Phari. Ths Chinese in Eastern Tibet.

A great deal of feeling has been aroused by this appointment among the in habitants of Eastern Tibet, and rumours are not wanting that Chao Ehr-feng’s progress has been opposed by force of arms. To what extent these rumours are true it is impossible to say ; but a certain amount of fighting has occurred, for early in November Chao Ehr-feng reported a complete victory over the Lama forces. A disturbance occurred at Phari Jong on July 4th between Bhutanese and Tibetans. It appears that a Bhutanese found a Tibetan trader living with his wife and beat him. On hearing of the affair the authorities despatched 12 Chinese soldiers to arrest the Bhutanese. Meanwhile the Bhutanese with some of his compatriots had taken refuge in a house, and these opened fire on the arrival of the soldiers. In reply the Chinese soldiery and some Tibetans set fire to the house and killed the first man who came out. The remainder were taken into custody. On July 17th a party of armed Bhutanese rode into the Popon’s yamen and demanded the surrender of the guilty parties. On being refused they released the Bhutanese prisoners. Einaliy the affair was settled by Ugyen Kazi, on behalf of Bhutan, and a Chinese official sent from Lhasa. It was agreed that Tibet should pay an indemnity Bs. 5,500 to Bhutan and Bs. 500 compensation to the parents of the man killed ; further, that certain headmen should be flogged, some of the Jongpens dismissed, and others fined. The Chinese have greatly extended their control in Eastern Tibet during the year. It was reported in January that the districts of Makkham, l)yo Jong, and Sang*nga-chohad been taken under the administration of Chinese officials. The negotiations between the Government of India on the one hand and China and Tibet on the other with regard to the revision of the Tibetan Trade Begulations were brought to a satisfactory conclusion on April 20th, 1908. The third and last instalment of the Tibetan indemnity was paid by the Tsarong Shape at Calcutta on January £7th, 1908, and on Eebruary 8 th the Britisli garrisons of Chumbi and Phari marched out in accordance with the terms of the Lhasa Convention of 1904, as modified by the Declaration append* ed to that Convention. It has been decided by the British Government that small escorts for the protection of the British Trade Agents shall be kept at Gyantse and Yatlmg until such time as the Government of India consider the Chineso police arrangements efficient. In May the Political Officer in Sikkim reported that though the Chinese officials are outwardly friendly, they appeared to seek every opportunity of making the position of the British Trade Agents as difficult as’possible. Mr. Chang, who by his hostile attitude towards our officials caused so much difficulty last year, left for Peking after the signing of the Tibetan Trade Begulations at Calcutta. It is unlikely that he will return to Tibet. EASTEBN BENGAL AND ASSAM. Communications, The metre-gauge line of railway from Kohrajhar to a point on the ri^ht bank of the Brahmaputra opposite Gauhati is nearly completed and wiirbe opened for traffic during the present cold weather. Military. The Government of India have sanctioned a revised scale of fire-arms for the civil police in the plains district of Eastern Bengal and Assam, which involves the supply of 154 additional •476 muskets. The Government of India has decided that, for the present, a force of l 1 battalions of regulars should be retained in the province, stationed as follows: — J battalion at Manipur. ^ „ Dibrugarh. i „ Shillong. jj jj Dacca,63 [hiitan® k will spatcki Jse will &amp;e os ^taosset !er were ato tlie i beio» tied bj Lhasa, in and ertain fined, mng mis. and ide le ae he nh. the Mg olice unese ty o£ mucli Trade ;e of t\ iloffS' The half battalion at Dacca will be found from the battalion at Shillong. Political. In December, 1907, in accordance with orders received from the Govern- Border raids * ment of India, the Superintendent, Lushai Hills, proceeded from Lungleh to the village of Zongling, on the southern border of the Lushai Hills District, and exacted a fine of 20 guns, valued at Rs 500. This fine was to punish the Zongling villagers for having, in 1906, raided the villages of Pemthar and Siata within the Administrative Border. No opposition was met with. In January a number of men from different Mozung villages beyond of AUsubo^VozuD* Naga Hills Frontier entered the Sangtam village of Alisubo and killed six vuiagos. ° y ozutlg persons. Four khels of the village of Char, coming to the aid ot‘ Alisubo, pursued the raiders and took two heads in the British village of Longmisa, near Mokokchang. The Deputy Commissioner was authorized to levy a fine of six mithun from the four khels of Char, for violating the frontier. In a letter, dated September 9th, 1907. the Government of Eastern Bengal to ^ r a df t \ e of Ab J r ° 8 llcy and Assam urged that British sovereignty should be asserted over the Abors. Sir Lancelot Hare urged that the policy of non-interference hitherto pursued had not been successful, and that more than half a century of proximity to civilization had failed to redeem the tribes from their native savagery. In a despatch, dated June 11th, 1903, the Government of India informed His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India that they were of opinion that British sovereignty should be asserted over the Abors living between the inner and outer lines, but that it should be confined to the stopping of the levying of blackmail on traders, the enforcement of a reasonable poll or house-tax on the settlers between the two lines, and to such measures as may be possible for the preservation of forests. Abrupt measures that might provoke a conflict should be avoided. Further, if political officers of Government can with safety cross the “ outer ” line, a tour might be undertaken to establish relations with the inhabitants of that tract. In a despatch, dated 4th September 1908, Lord Morley discussed the pro posal of the Government of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The policy of non-in terference was, he stated, essentially sound, and he was unable to admit the plea that it had failed to a degree to justify its reversal. He agreed with the Government of India that the local Government s proposals could not, therefore, be accepted in their entirety. The proposed tour of the Assistant Political Officer, Sadiya, to the Abor villages beyond the “ outer” line might be under taken on the conditions laid down by the Government of India, provided that it could safely be made without risk of conflict with the tribes. Particular emphasis was laid upon the necessity of avoiding any action involving the risk of serious consequences. Lord Morley requested that the matter might again be submitted for his consideration before the proposed tour was finally sanctioned. On the 8 th October, a copy of the above despatch was communicated to the Local Government wiih the request that a copy of the detailed instructions, which it was proposed to issue to Mr. Williamson, might be forwarded to the Government of India, in sufficient time to admit of the approval of His Majes ty’s Government being obtained before the tour commenced. Attention was drawn to Lord Morley’s suggestion regarding the grant of some pecuniary compensation to the Abors for the loss of commission on timber, which they undoubtedly considered a legitimate source of revenue. In January, 1908, a raiding party composed of men from the trans-frontier tain^'^mnsUrontier villages of Yazim, Yongia, Tangsa, Kamaho, Lingra, and Yaong, raided Yangpi, Naga villages, another trans-frontier village. On being repulsed and hard-pressed the raid ing party returned to their own villages via British territory. As the raid on Yangpi was unprovoked, and Yazim village is a constant offender, it has been decided to despatch a force of 75 rifles this cold weather to inflict a fine of 25 mithun on Yazim village and suitable smaller fines on the other villages con cerned, on account of the violation of the British border.64. PERSIA. POLITICAL. (Internal ) General Situation in Throughout the year the state of disorder and anarchy prevailing in the Persia * country has been continuous. The local Governors, finding all their actions hampered by the local assemblies, either resigned their posts or refrained from taking any action to maintain order in their respective districts : the power to do so was quite beyond the local assemblies. The natural result was that the country was oyerrun by bands of armed robbers, and that trade practically ceased on even the main roads. In the Capital was witnessed the coup whereby the Shah in June overthrew the Constitution, and once more assumed the powers of a despotic ruler. Tabriz, and other cities in a minor degree, have been the scene of strife, riots, and general disorder. The Shah and the National Assembly. After the crisis of the 15th December 1907 and the Shah’s attempted coup d'etat, recorded in the Annual Summary for the previous year, the posi tion of the Persian house of Parliament was,probably stronger than it had e?er been previous to that time. A temporary reconciliation between the Shah and the Parliament was effected, -and Tehran remained relatively quiet for a time. Amir Bahadur Jang still continued to perform his duties as Commander- in-Chief of the Shah’s Body Guard, but theforce was placed unders the orders of the Minister of War. A new Cabinet was formed under the direction of the Mzam-us.Sultaneh, and the Ihtisham-us Sultaneh remained President of the Assembly. Dissensions, however, soon appeared in the Majlis. The President became an object of suspicion, and was accused of having joined the Shah’s party, as well as of entertaining strong pro-German tendencies. At the end of January he had a violent quarrel with the Chief Mujtahid, Saiyid Abdullah, which con siderably complicated matters, and it seemed that his resignation was inevit able. J anuary. February. The only work of importance accomplished by the House during the month of January whs a sanction given to the German proposal to enlarge their school, and the enhancement of the subscription paid by the Persian Government. The Shah, in spite of his oath to support the Assembly, continued to intri gue against it, and was believed to have hired six assassins to remove the more prominent supporters of the Constitutional regime. These men murdered Fari- dun, a Parsee merchant, who had given the Assembly some rifles, and attacked the house of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The unsatisfactory state of affairs caused by the rupture between the Cleri cal and National parties did not improve. On the 16th February, the House voted the dismissal of the Asaf-ud-Dauleh, the Minister of the Interior, on various charges, and the Cabinet was in conse quence reconstructed, the Nizam-us-Sultaneh retaining the Premiership. The President’s activity in support of German education caused much adverse comment. During the month financial matters were again discussed with, however, little result. March, April. At a sitting on the 2nd March a lengthy rescript from the Shah was read in which His Majesty urged the Assembly to insist on the speedy arrest of the persons who had attempted his life at the close of February. Protests were lodged against the grant of the subvention of 12,000 tumans a year for the German school, which, it transpired, was to come from the Cus toms Revenue, and not from the Shah’s Civil List, as had been supposed. Hie 1 resident still continued to retain his seat although his unponularitv was increasing. 11 J In April the Ihtisham us-Sultaneb was finally forced to resign, and Mum- taz-ud-Daulek was elected to the Presidency on the 4 th of the month. Considerable excitement was caused by the arbitrary arrest cf certain ner- by &lt; th + e Chief ° f J tlie Poli(,e ’ acting under the orders of the Shah, th, pr rn S T e ma i e . a ' aillst what was considered to be a violation of allowihr wi 01 ! - i 116 lr l me ] ^ mister was seYer ely censured by the Shah for a eis o come to such a pass, and the whole Cabinet in consequenceresigned on the 13th April, hut were induced to remain in office. Eventually the Governor of l ehran and the Chief of the Police were tried by the Ministry of War in the presence of the Cabinet Ministers, found guilty of violating xhe Constitution, which both admitted not having read, and a nominal sentence was passed on them. On the 21st April, the Cabinet attended at the House and were interpel lated on subjects of public interest. The proceedings were conducted with regularity, and the Ministers were reported to have exhibited a marked sens e of their responsibility to the Assembly. On the 25th April, the Sani-ud-Dauleh presented his so-called budget to the House, in which he proposed to increase the duties on tea and sugar for the purpose of restoring financial equilibrium. A suggestion that the Persian Government should consult their Pinancial Adviser, M. Bizot, gave rise to much discussion. The Cabinet resigned on the 2nd May, and was re-appointed four days May. later, but the resignation of the Premier on the 16th idem occasioned a further re-distribution of posts. A telegram was sent by the Shah to the Nasr-ul-Mulk, who was travelling in Europe, inviting him to return to Persia as Prime Minister, but the offer was not accepted. On the 30th May, Mushir-ud-Dauleh resigned his post as Foreign Minister. June, At the commencement of June, the dismissal of objectionable members of the Shah’s entourage, including Chapchal, was demanded, and to this the Shah agreed, but Amir Bahadur Jang took refuge at the Russian Legation, while Chapchal and the others ignored the order. On the 4th June, the Shah left the palace for his country seat at Bagh-i- Shah, accompanied by a strong Cossack escort. This move resulted in great excitement in the Capital. The Assembly held aloof, but the Zill-us’Sultan was unquestionably fomenting agitation against the Shah, and it was reported that he bad received an invitation from the Anjumans to assume the Regency at Tehran. On the 7th June, the new Cabinet was presented to the House. On the following day, the Shah arrested the Zill-us-Sultan’s eldest son, the Jalal-ud-Dauleh, also Ala-ud-Dauleh, Sardar Mansur, and Asad-ul-Mulk: whereupon Amir Bahadur Jang left the Russian Legation. The next day Cossacks patrolled the Capital, and a proclamation was issued hy the Shah denouncing the persons arrested as traitors. The general belief was that the coup was contrived and backed by the Russians. At the instance of the Anjumans a general strike was proclaimed in the Capital, and the Shah’s direct order to resume work was ignored. As a con sequence the Shah assembled a military force, whereupon the Assembly present ed him with a memorial demanding the dispersal of the force and assurances that he would not again transgress the laws of the Constitution. Telegraphing on the 20th, Mr. Marling reported that the Shah did not seem disposed to give a satisfactory reply to this memorial, but demanded in turn the banishment of certain of the Nationalist leaders, the censorship of the press, the closing of the Anjumans, and an increase of the Palace guards to 10 , 000 . The National Assembly, confident that the Shah would, as on former occasions, eventually yield, continued to disregard his authority, and finally delivered an ultimatum demanding a reply to the memorial within 48 hours. On this the Shah determined to strike, and by a sudden coup made himself master of the situation. Early on the morning of the 23rd June he sent forty Cossacks to arrest eight persons in a mosque adjoining the Assembly House. The request to surrender was refused, and a bomb was throwm from the Assembly66 enclosure killing three Cossacks and two horses. Shots were also fired from the Mosque, and the Azarbaijan Anjuman enclosure, and several Cossacks were killed. Colonel Liakhoff becoming exasperated ordered the guns, which had been placed in readiness and trained on the Assembly house and Mosque, to open fire. These buildings were cleared and destroyed, as also were the meeting places of the Anjumans, The Shaikh-ur-Rais, the Chief Mujtahid Saiyid Abdullah, and some ten other alleged leaders of the popular party were appre hended. The Cossack Brigade lost 11 officers and about 150 men killed and wounded, and the opposing side some 300 or 400. The Anjumans were dispers ed, and the houses of certain notables (including that of the Zill-us-Sultan) were pillaged, hut on the whole tolerable order was maintained. Two proclama tions were then issued by the Shah, one declaring martial law, and the other a general amnesty. It was announced also that the Shah had no desire to abolish the Constitution, hut that regulations would he issued for the assembly of another Parliament, and for the formation of a Senate in three months 5 time. Colonel Liakhoff, the Commander of the Persian Cossack Brigade, played one of the principal parts in the events of the 23rd June. He was appointed Governor of Tehran by the Shah, and it was in his name that martial law was proclaimed, and regulations dealing with the unrest in the Capital issued. For the purpose of enforcing these laws and regulations he was given full power over the police and military forces. His advice was followed by the Shah, and finally it was reported that Colonel Liakhoff had for the time being practically become Dictator of the Empire, and that a situation was created which was harfily distinguishable from Russian intervention. On the 25th June, Mr. Marling reported that the Shah had obtained complete mastery, the Anjumans seemed to be cowed, and their supporters falling away, and about thirty persons (including the President of the Assembly) had been arrested, two of whom had been strangled in the Shah’s camp on the previous morning. There were at the time about 50 refugees in the British Legation. On the same day the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs came to see Mr. Marling with a message from the Shah to the effect that His Majesty had heard with surprise that the Legation was encouraging people to take refuge in it, a proceeding inconsistent with the acknowledged British policy of non-inter vention. Mr. Marling denied these rumours, stating that the refugees had come much against his will, but that they had undoubted reason to fear for their lives, as was proved by the executions at the Shah’s camp, and that he could not surrender those who had sought British protection without a guarantee for fair trial. At the same time he promised that he would do his best to discourage other refugees from coming to the Legation, hut that he would only permit peaceful methods to he employed. Meanwhile, in order to prevent people having access to the Legation, Cossacks were posted all round it, and even the Legation servants had great difficulty in entering. This was an act of gross discourtesy and Mr. Marling protested against it. In this protest it was intimated that the punishment of the officer responsible for this state of affairs might be required. By this Colonel Liakhoff was plainly indicated, as it was by his orders the Cossacks had been posted round the Legation. The Russian Minister in a frank conversation with Mr. Marling accused the members of the British Legation of harbouring refugees for political reasons, and seemed disinclined to credit Mr. Marling’s assurances to the contrary. On the 28th June Mr, Marling telegraphed to Sir E. Grey that the British Legation was being practically besieged, that Great Britain was being humiliated in the eyes of the Persians, and that the situation was becoming intolerable. He further reported that an unsatisfactory reply had been received to his protest, that the Persian Government had not tendered a word of apology, and that in his opinion further forbearance appeared to be misplaced. On this, representations were made at St. Petersburg, with the result that a rebuke was administered to the Russian Minister at Tehran, who, together with Colonel Liakhoff, it was stated, was causing the Russian Government much embarrassment. They were instructed to curtail their activities for the future.On the preceding day, the Secretary of State had telegraphed to Mr. Marling that the Shah and the Persian Government should be informed by him that in view of the repeated insults to which His Majesty’s Legation had been exposed at the hands of the Cossack Brigade and the Tehran police, and against which a formal protest had been lodged, His Majesty's Government, after careful deliberation on the situation, formulated the following demands with which immediate compliance was necessary to restore good relations :— (1) The immediate withdrawal of the Cossacks and the Police from the approaches to the Legation, and freedom of British subjects and servants from molestation at their hands. ( 2 ) A formal and full apology, after due notification had been given, to be offered in person, and in uniform, at the British Legation, by the High Chamberlain on behalf of the Shah, and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Persian Government. (3) ill persons recently arrested going to, or coming from, the British Legation on ordinary business to be immediately released. (4) A written guarantee to be given by the Shah for the lives, persons, and property of the bast is. (5) If there were any bastis charged with crimes as distinct from those of the nature of political offences, they to be given a fair trial in the presence of a member of the British Legation. Mr. Marling was instructed to state in formulating these demands, that in the event of their not being immediately accepted and fulfilled, His Majesty’s Government would be compelled to take such steps as they considered fit to obtain the reparation which they regarded as due to them. The occupation of a Persian port or island had been suggested as the best means of exacting repara tion, but Mr. Marling was not to mention this unless he was asked what was meant by reparation. On the 2nd July, Mr. Marling reported that he had been to seethe Russian Minister, whom he found much sobered, and anxious to explain away every thing, especially as regards the action of the Russian Colonel, He stated that he had forbidden the latter to accept the Governorship of Tehran, and that his name no longer appeared on proclamations. However, Mr. Marling was able to point to a severe police notice which had been issued in his name on the previous day. On the 3rd July, Mr. Marling communicated the demands formulated by His Majesty’s Government to the Shah, and on the 5th the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the Shah was ready to accept all the demands, except that he desired as regards paragraph No. 4 that a few—at most 4 or 5— of the refugees in the Legation should leave Persia. Mr. Marling was of opinion that this request should be conceded, but that the periods of exile should be limited. On the 6 th July, Mr. Marling reported that relations had become more cordial between the Russian Minister and himself, objectionable patrolling by Cossacks in the vicinity of the Legation had ceased, and proclamations were no longer being signed by the Russian Colonel. On the 9th July, the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg reported that the Russian Government had stated that Colonel Liakhoff’s action had been taken wholly independently of the Russian Government, and was therefore to be regretted. On the 11th of July, the formal apology of the Persian Government was tendered to Mr. Marling by Ala-us-Sultaneh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by the Vizir Afkham on behalf of the Shah. At the same time guarantees were given for the lives, property, and persons of the refugees. The Shah, however, demanded that six persons should leave the country for periods varying from 5 to 10 years. This Mr. Marling thought was excessive.68 Oi the 13th July, Mr. Marling reported that the Shah had modified Ms previous demands with regard to the exiling of certain of the refugees. The periods of absence for Taqizadeh, and a popular orator, were reduced to one and a half years, and for three others to one year. He wished four others to leave Tehran and to go to their own houses, whilst a strict watch would be kept on those who had left the Legation to see that they were not plotting against him. Two releases had already been made under paragraph No. 3 of His Majesty’s demands Ala-ud-Dauleh and Jalal-ud-Dauleh were to proceed to Europe, and Sardar Mansur to Khorasan. The Zill-us-Sultan was also to be allowed to leave the country. In spite of these reassuring signs, however, general apprehension continued, and persons who believed themselves in danger were constantly expressing a wish to be allowed to come to Gulhak. On the same day the Secretary of State instructed Mr. Marling that the Shah’s modified demand might be accepted, and that it should be explained to the bastis that His Majesty’s Government could not ask for better terms than these. It should also he borne in mind that, for the future, protection could only he given to save life, and that the British Legation could not be used as a refuge for leaders of any political party when things were going adversely, in order that they might renew operations when a more favourable opportunity presented itself. On the night of the 16th July, however, a crowd of about 200 persons made a determined attempt to enter the Legation compound, but were prevented. There were no bastia in the Legation at Gulhak, although there were some in the village. On the 17th July the Shah sent Mafteh-us-Sultaneh with a message that he had learnt that another attempt to force an entrance into the Legation was to be made that evening, and enquired whether he would permit guards to be posted round it. To this Mr. Marling returned an unqualified refusal, but not* withstanding, that night 20 foot Cossacks were posted about the Legation between 7 and 9 p.m., and a patrol passed by the next morning. Mr. Marling thought that there was real danger that bast, in large numbers might be attempted, more especially if the persons already in bast were to leave; for while they remained the people looked upon their presence as a guarantee that His Majesty’s Government would do something to assist them. There were then in the village of Gulhak 63 refugees, most of whom had arrived during the previous two days. On the same day (i.e., 17th July) the Secretary of State, telegraphing to Mr. Marling, instructed him to endeavour to persuade the bastis to leave, since it was evident that the privilege of asvlum in the Legation was being used for political purposes. If there was apprehension of bast being taken in large numbers tiie Legation gates should he closed, and the people informed that any attempt to force them would be resented by His Majesty s Government. At the same time Mr. Marling was authorised by the Secretary of State to make, in conjunction with his Hussian Colleague, a friendly representation to the Shah urging, as the surest means cf restoring tranquillity in the country, the early convocation of the Assembly. The Kussian Minister, however, declined to co-operate with the British Charge d’Affaires in this matter, on the ground that it would he inviting the Shah to vield to pres sure, and he thought that Mr. Marling ought to forcibly expel the refugees at the time m Gulhak, and prevent others reaching it; if he had not sufficient police to effect tins himself, he ought to call on the Persian Government to ?n S 1 + St !i Ura ‘ ^ he Il . ussiai1 Mjmster w i s hed doubtless to produce the impression tnat the two Legations were supporting the Shah against the Nationalists. Torr ? nt r e 2 ^ th v Uly A Mr ^ M ^ rlingre P ortedthat allthe hnstis had left the Legation for Enzah the Persian Government promising to give 900 tumans i” S e nT DSe f J those leaving Persia . , rhis sum was a D dvance[1 by Mr . drling. lae gates of tlie Legation were closed, and orders were issued that m no case were unauthorised persons to be allowed to enter. People, however, me to resi e in the village of Gulhak, there being on tiie 25th July one hundred refugees there altogether. Ibis was probably owing to the sense of insecurity produced by the constant domiciliary visits of the Cossacks, who wereendeavouring to apprehend the persons concerned in the attempt on the Shah’s life in February. The number of refugees in Gulhah continued to increase to such an extent (at one time there were more than 300 in the village) that, on the 4th August, Mr. Marling obtained permission from the Secretary of State to apply to the Persian Government for a force of police in order to expel them, and it was made clear to the people that bast in His Majesty’s Legation could only he allowed when there was imminent danger to life. In August the Russian and British Governments, in view of the grave Augn«t. situation that had been created in Persia, arranged the terms of a joint com munication, which was presented to the Shah, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 8 th September, advising him—not with any wish to interfere in the internal affairs of Persia, but in the interests of general prosperity and trade, and of the definite pacification of the country—to make the announcement that his decision in regard to the maintenance of the organic laws granted by him to the Empire was irrevocable, and that on the i4th November Parliament should re-assemble at Tehran. On the 18th September, the Shah replied to the joint Anglo-Russian com- September, munication, the substance of the reply being that necessary steps were being taken in compliance with promises made to form an Assembly in accordance with the country’s wants and in conformity with its religion, in order that disturbances should not recur; and that the Shah w T as in hopes of issuing a proclamation for the convocation of Parliament on the date above-mentioned, but, until order had been restored in Tabriz, where the Persian Government would require time to make the necessary arrangements, the Assembly would not open. This reply was not considered satisfactory as no assurance was given for the maintenance of the organic laws. On the 2nd October, a rescript was published by the Shah, the meaning of 0 ctob er. which was not clear, but it seemed to show that there was an intention of remodelling the old Constitution. Parliament was to be convoked on the 14th November, and an electoral law was to be published on the 27th October. On the 2Sth October, it was reported that the Shah had not carried out his promise to issue the electoral law on the previous day. In the meantime the Shah had been excommunicated by order of the Hujjat-ul-Islam, and a telegram from him to the Mujtahids of Najaf threat ening them with punishment if they interfered in the affairs of the State elicited a reply, which was widely published, couched in terms of defiance and opprobrium. On the 7th November an artificial demonstration was organized by Amir November. Bahadur Jaug, Mushir-us-Sultaneh, and other reactionaries, praying the Shah not to reintroduce the Majlis on the ground that it was contrary to Islamic law. On the 8 th the British and Russian Ministers sent an identical Memoran dum urging the Shah to fulfil his numerous promises to re-establish the Con stitution; but on the 19th renewed demonstrations were made at Bagh-i-Sliah against the constitutional regime, and the Shah issued a Rescript stating that he had given up all idea of forming a Majlis iu the future. The British and Russian Legations immediately addressed a joint note to the Foreign Minister on the subject which resulted in the Rescript being with drawn on the 23rd, and,on the 25th the Foreign Minister explained that it only referred to the last Majlis. On the 29th November a Council of State, composed of some 40 persons chosen by the Shah, to take the place of the Majlis, was inaugurated ; and on the 8 th December the official Gazette “ Iran” published an article on this new December, Council, the members of which would, it stated, be “ elected.”70 Tftbri* bances. Distaf' The Shah having refused to receive the British and Russian Dragomans the two Legations sent a joint Memorandum to the Foreign Minister on the J4th December saying that the Council of the notables could in no way he regarded as a fulfilment of His Majesty’s promise, as its members were not elected by the people. On the 20th December a number of persons, including the leading Mujtahid, Sadr-ul-Ulema, took refuge in the Turkish E mb ? ss y— th ®J r increasing to 270 the next day, at which figure they remained until the close of the year. On the 22nd December the Shah received the Dragomans of the British and Russian Legations, who were sent to impress upon him the urgency of g ra ^ tm S the demands of the people in order to avoid complications. BisMajes y ec are that he intended to keep his promises and to summon deputies to a new Assembly ; and proposed to entrust the task of elaborating an Electoral law to a Select Committee of the Council of State. On the whole, the Shah’s attitude seemed promising ; hut the following day the Clergy and Notables met at the Naib-us-bultaneh s house, and undid whatever good might have been done, for on the 24th it was evident that the Shah had again gone back on his word. On the 29th December the principal bazars were closed; but were re-opened two days later. The situation at the close of the year was described as critical, for it was impossible to foretell what difficulties the Shah’s obstinacy might not eventually lead to. On the information of the Shah’s coup d'etat of the 23rd June reaching Tabriz, disturbances at once broke out in that town; the bazars were closed and fighting commenced between the Shah’s partisans, headed by the priests under their chief Mujtahid Haji Mirza Hasan Agha, and the Constitutionalists. On the 28th June a number of revolutionaries took bast in the Russian Con sulate-General, whilst many applied for admittance to His Majesty’s Consulate, but were refused. An attempt on the part of the Russian Consul-General to mediate between the two parties proved fruitless, hut at his instance the Nationalists allowed tribal cavalry to enter the town in order to preserve order. Soon after, how ever, the Shah’s adherents began looting, whereupon the Nationalists decided to continue the struggle and re-assembled their forces. Serious rioting took place, bread became scarce, the town was threatened by tribesmen of the Karadji Dagh, the local authorities were powerless, and considerable blood shed seemed imminent. Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, the Governor-General, took refuge in the Erench Consulate, and Ain-ud-Dauleh was appointed to succeed him. Sardar Rahim Khan, a Karadji Dagh chieftain, was deputed by the Shak to quell the disturbances. This man was a notorious bandit, whose depredations some years back had been so serious and numerous that it had been found necessary to suppress him and to keep him a prisoner in Tehran. On the 14th July he entered Tabriz with about 1,000 horsemen and three cannon. His orders were to act in concert with the Mujtahid and punish Tabriz. The revolutionaries under Satar Khan and Baqir Khan, the former an erstwhile Karadji Daghi brigand, and subsequent horse-dealer and political enthusiast, and the latter a Tabrizi stonemason, resisted the Government troops from behind barricades, and some fighting ensued. During the course of the next few days, the strength of the Revolution aries increased, and on the 19th Rahim Khan was compelled to quit the town. The battalion of infantry, about 800 strong, which came down from Tehran to reinforce the Royalists, dispersed, as the men had received no pay and could procure no bread. The Russian Consul-General again attempted to intervene, but his efforts were unavailing.On the 21st, a fierce attack was made by the Revolutionaries on the Government troops. They were at first successful, but later met with a check, and on the 23rd were compelled to retire from their advanced positions. About 200 casualties were reported. Then followed a lull in the hostilities of one day’s duration, due to pourparlers between the belligerents, but on the evening of the 24th firing was resumed, the Royalists bringing a 9-inch mortar into action. As the shooting from this latter weapon was somewhat erratic the Christian quarter was thought to be in danger. On the 28th a meeting of the Consular Corps, attended by the merchants’ delegates, was held at the Russian Consulate-General. It was stated that the population would lay down their arms on condition of receiving a complete amnesty for political offences guaranteed by the Legations, and of the dissolu tion of the Anjuman-i-Islamiah. Hostilities were suspended during these and other efforts at reconciliation, Ai hut again broke out on 1st August. The citadel, held by the Revolutionaries, was bombarded, and shells fell in the Christian quarter. On the 2 nd the wires of the telegraph lines were cut, but at the request of the British Vice- Consul were again repaired, on condition that no Government message should be sent. On the 4th August, news of the restoration of the Turkish Constitution was divulged by the Ottoman Consul-General, and this put heart into the Nationalist party. It was suggested that the Sultan would make as good a ruler as the Shah. On the 7th fighting, which had hitherto been desultory, was vigorously renewed by the Shah’s forces. Heavy fighting continued for three days, with shell and rifle fire. On the 13th, the Russian Consul-General applied to the Russian Minister for Eoreign Affairs for a detachment of Cossacks to protect him. It appeared also that the Turkish Government proposed to send an escort to Tabriz to pro tect their representative, but on receiving solemn assurances from the Shah tna the Turkish Consulate and Turkish subjects would not be molested in any way, they abandoned the idea. On the 20th August, the Ain-ud-Dauleh, the new Governor-General, and Sipahdar, the Commander-in-Chief, who were marching to reduce Tabriz with 100 Cossacks and 1,300 troops, reached the town. On the 23rd the local Assembly presented a petition to the Government and formulated their demands, which were that, while remaining loyal subjects of the Shah so long as he maintained the Constitution, they would not disarm until Parliament was opened; they further demanded that the Royalist leaders should he arrested and punished after dne trial, and that the affairs of Azai t&gt;ai- jan should be under the supervision of the Tabriz local Assembly until Parlia ment reopened. At the end of the month, no reply having been received from Tehran, the tension between the two parties became sensibly greater. The Nationalist forces at this time numbered some 10,000 men, and funds were collected to continue the struggle. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul received, a warning not to go out alone as the Revolutionaries had decided to force the intervention of the European Powers by killing a foreigner or some Christian. The excitement m the town had reached a high pitch, and the lives of Europeans and Christians might at any moment have been in imminent danger. The British Vice-Consul succeeded in arranging a meeting between the Ain-ud-Dauleh and a deputation of the inhabitants, with a view to the restoration of order. During these negotiations the Revolutionaries abstained from acts of violence, hut, on the evening of the 5th, some Government horsemen raided a part of the Nationalist quarter, which excited the utmost indignation among the Revolutionaries, and was taken as a proof of tlm im possibility of placing any confidence in the good faith of the authorities. Right ing was consequently resumed on the 7 th.72 October. November. Tecember. Biots in M&lt;shed, As regards the action of the Turkish Consul-General, there seems to be no doubt that he had done much to encourage the Revolutionary party to continue the struggle, and is even said to have intimated that Turkey will follow the example of the Powers in Macedonia and intervene in Persian affairs. Information from various sources tended to show also that the Pevolution* ary party was being assisted both with men and guns by sympathisers from Tiflis, M. de Hartwig himself admitting that about 400 fighting men had been sent from that place to support them. During the remainder of the month of September, the situation re mained practically unchanged. Attempts to come to an understanding between the Ain-ud-Dauleh and the Revolutionary leaders proved abortive, and, on the 6 th October, both the British and Russian Governments represented to the Persian Government that they would be held responsible for the lives and property of foreigners residing in the town. On the 9th October the situation became critical, the inhabitants were star ving, the Nationalists were in need of funds and becoming desperate, and there was some apprehension that in order to procure foreign intervention the Consu lates would be mobbed and foreigners molested. The Nationalist party on the 9th made an attack on the camp of the Governor*General, and on the Maku Cavalry, in which the latter were defeated and retired. There were reported to be 150 casualties altogether. All the Royalists retired a few days later and Tabriz remained in undisputed possession of the Nationalists. Various reports gained ground that Russian troops had crossed the Azarbai- jan frontier, and Sir E. Grey, interpellated in the House, stated on the 27th Oc tober, that Russia had moved 400 men to the Persian frontier, but had ordered them not to cross unless Russian lives at Tabriz w r ere endangered. He further stated that we could not refuse Russia the right, which we ourselves claim, of protecting the lives of her subjects, and he asked the House to admit that Russia had acted in accordance w-ith the spirit of the Ansrlo-Russian Conven tion. On the 12 th October a detachment of the Persian Cossack Brigade left Tehran for Tabriz. It u’as composed of 200 cavalry, 150 infantry and 50 gun ners with 4 guns. The force was joined on the way to Kazvin by Captain Ushakoff, the infantry instructor of the Brigade, but he returned to^Tehran as the Russian Government ordered the Russian officers serving with the Brigade to remain there. The Governor General was said to have been re-in forced by 300 Persian Cossacks and 6 guns about the middle of the month, but Tabriz was not impressed thereby. On the 21 st the Nationalists took possession of Maraud : and a few days later Binab, on the Eastern shore of lake Urumieh, was occupied by them. On the night °f the eth December the Royalist camp at Basmineh was attacked by Nationalists, who were driven hack with the loss of a number in killed and wounded. In Salmas, however, it appears the National party gained some successes; but towards the end ot the year it was stated that tiie Ain-ud-DauIeh was making efforts to cut off labnz, and early fighting was anticipated. On the 1 st December it was reported that the arrest of a prominent member of the Revolutionary Party, followed by the placing of a strong guard ovei the leading reactionary s house, had been the cause of a riot in Meshed. Later it was reported that the rioters had seized the telegraph office. How ever, on .he lull it was reported that the revolution had come to an end.In February it was reported that the Samsam-us-Sultaneh, the Bahhtiari Ar ^ 8 t t u a , J ailceB in Ilkani, was on his way to Ram Hormuz, where his men were assembling to attack* the Kuhgalu, who had recently made a raid in that neighbourhood. In March it was reported that fighting had taken place at Shushtar, where some of tbe people had turned against the Kalantars, who belonged to the fac tion of Shaikh Murtaza. At the end of October Arab contingents were assembled for an expedition against the Hawizeh tribes, who were in rebellion ; and on the 26th November Sardar ‘Arfa wrote from Muhammareh to say that the Bani Turuf had sub mitted, and accepted his nominees as Shaikhs, and agreed to expel the rebellious ones. During the second half of the year there has been a continual struggle The Governorship between the Shaukat-ul-Mulk and the Hasbmat-ul-Mulk for the Governor.'* Kain. ship of Kain. The former was in possession at Birjand, and was strongly backed bv His Majestj’s Consul for Sistan and Kain. The latter carried on his intrigues in Tehran. Tarly in September it was reported that the Hashmat-ul Mulk had succeeded in securing the Governorship for tumans £ 9 , 000 , part of which was paid in cash, and the balance guaranteed by the Russian Bank; that the Firman of appointment had been issued, but would be kept secret and not produced until tbe arrival at Bhjand of the Hash- matml-Mulk himself, or his son Mir Mausum, who had received orders to pro ceed from Sistan to that place. It was considered that the success of the Hash- mat-ul-Mulk would be very much to the detriment of British prestige, and they would be accused of not being able to support their protegd, the Shaukat-ul- Mulk, against Russia. Finally the question was referred to His Majesty’s Gov ernment, by whom it was decided as politically inexpedient to oppose the appointment of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk further. At the end of April it was reported that the Deputy-Governorship Sistan had been given to Mir Mausum Khan, who, according to His Majesty’s Consul, is less friendly to us than his biother, Muhammad Riza Khan, the late Deputy Governor. Early in January it was reported that an Afghan caravan of 250 camels, Disturbances in laden with wool, proceeding from Herat to India, was robbed at Chah Muham- Sl8tauand Kain- mad Riza by thieves, who, it was said, were the servants of the Governor of Kaleh Fath. The camels were subsequently recovered ; but as there had been several such thefts, His Majesty’s Consul in Sistan asked the Karguzar to put some men at Hauzdar as a check on robbers. The Persian post which left Sistan for Meshed on the 21 st February was robbed between Nasratabad and Baring. The dak Sowar was killed, and a sum of tumans 1,00 q belonging to the Imperial Bank of Persia, was carried off. ' In September it w r as reported that a caravan en route to Sistan was looted at Anjireh by a gang of seven Afghans from Lash Juwain, armed with breech loading rifles, who killed one man, wounded another, and carried off property valued at krans 5,000. There was supposed to be a post of five Persian sarba- zes at Anjireh to guard the road, but the men had left their post.

On the 1st April, two Hindus, in whose shop a prostitute had been found Assault cn Hindus the night before, were severely assaulted by a mob, who were proceeding to ia Slstan, force them to embrace Islam when tiiey were rescued by some Persian officials and handed over to the British Consulate. The affair caused some excitement and riots were feared, but the prompt action taken by the local authorities prevented any further disturbances, and quiet was restored in a few days. As a result of representations made by His Majesty’s Consul thieeof the assail-Disturbances Kirman. Disturbances Kimanshah. Disturbances Yazd. Disturbances Fars. ants were deported to Meshed under guard ; nnd six others were flogged in the presence of the Vice-Consul. Subsequently the deported delinquents were allowed to return to their homes. in Early in January the British Consul in Rinnan reported that the situation there was very threatening, and that a general attack on property involving danger to Europeans was to be apprehended. However, nothing untoward occurred, although the town remained in a very disturbed condition. During the greater part of the year there was no regular Governor of the town or district, and as a result matters remained in a considerable state of chaos. Political agitation was at the bottom of most of the unrest in the town. Throughout the year the district in the neighbourhood of Kirman, and in particular the roads leading to Yazd and Bandar Abbas, continued to be in a most unsafe condition. During the month of January the town of Zarand was looted by a large hand of armed robbers, and the posts were frequently delayed and even robbed. in At the beginning of May it was reported that Kirmanshah was practical ly surrounded by tribes fighting, looting, or about to commence fighting. There was no Governor or Deputy-Governor. The only regiment was that of Azam- ud-Dauleh, who refused to do anything, and said that as he had been dismissed, State affairs did not concern him. It was stated that the condition of Kirmanshah had never been so had. Later in the month it was reported that the Kakavands had crossed into Kirmanshah territory from Luristan and were looting the villages around Bisa- tun and Chamchamal. On. the 11 th Mr. and Mrs. Stead of the American Mission were driving from Bisatun to Senna, when they were stopped by this tribe and looted of everything that they had with them, carriage, horses, and clothes ; Mr. Stead walked barefooted into Bisatun. A caravan proceeding in front of the Steads was looted, and the road was said to be in a most un safe condition. Early in August it was reported that the Tehran-Kirmanshah post road was held up by robbers near Daulatabad, and that travellers had been stopped on the way. In the middle of November the Kalhur and Guran tribes were occupying Sar-i-Pul, one march from Qasr-i-Shirin, with the intention of attacking Samsam-ul-Mamalik, Chief of the Senjabi tribe, the Governor of Qasr i-Shirin. The latter, finding himself unable to hold his own, threw himself on the mercy of Daud Khan, the Kalhur Chief, and was deposed from the Governorship. The result, was that the roads were, at the close of the year, in the hands of Daud Khan’s tribesmen, posts were robbed, and it was thought that if Daud Khan was not punished, the country would become unsafe for Europeans, and British trade suffer considerably, Captain Lorimer had a horse stolen by these tribesmen, and only succeeded in recovering it on payment of a sum of 15 tumans. It was said that Daud Khan was proceeding to meet the Governor of Kirmanshah in order to come to terms with him at the end of the year. i n In June, as a protest against the imposition of a new tax, the peasants fiona the surrounding district took refuge iu the Indo-European Telegraph Department s Office in Yazd. At ore time the number of refugees amounted to from 2,000 to 3,000 persons. Matters wore a very serious complexion as the Go^einoi was not inclined to deal amicably with the Acting British Vice- Consul. However, after the matter had been referred to Tehran the refugees were finally persuaded to return to their homes. in In January the Bushire-Shiraz road was reported as being in a very unsafe condition. Caravans w r ere constantly looted by the tribes living in its neighbourhood and the post w^as delayed for considerable periods at a time.During the same month the sons of the (Javvam-ul-Mulk returned to Shiraz and a temporary reconciliation was effected between their party and that of Mutamid-ud-Diwan and the Saiyid-i-Lari (vide Summary for 1907). Hostilities, however, were subsequently renewed. In February, the Bushire-Shiraz road was again much disturbed owing to fighting between Nur Muhammad Khan of Dalaki and Haidar Khan of Kamarii. Caravan traffic came to a standstill, and the pests were frequently stopped and robbed. The Samsam-us-Sultan, Ilbegi of the Kashgai tribesmen, was deputed by the Governor-General (the Sahib Ikhtiar, who had succeeded the Nizam-us-Sultaneh in February) to restore order. Asa consequence the road became more secure for a while, though even then it was not entirely freed from robbers. The feud between the Qavvami party and the Lari party assumed critical proportions in March, when Shiraz was the scene of several outrages of an alarmino' nature. The Qavvam-ul-Mulk, who had been rash enough to return to Shiraz, was shot dead on the 7th March by a man named Ni’mat-ullah, a servant in the service of the Mutamid-ud-Diwan : and, on the 9th, the Salar- us-Sultan, eldest son of the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, when attending the obsequies of his father, was fired at and wounded in the thigh by a certain Saiyid Ahmed Dashtaki, tbe moving spirit of the local Anjuman-Mslam. The Saiy id fled from the building, but was seized before he had gone very far, and dragged back, the crowd riddling him with bullets. The body was then placed on a gibhet, drenched with petroleum, and finally burned, the remains being thrown into the town moat. During the course of these proceedings desultory firing took place, and four people were said to have been killed. The town was in a ferment, and a band of the Qavvamis marched to the palace of the Governor- General and demanded the blood of the Mutamid-ud-Diwan. The Sahib Ikhtiar, assisted by His Majesty's Consul, succeeded with great difficulty in pacifying them. On the 22nd March it appears the leaders of both parties were summoned to Tehran in connection with the murder. Later a revulsion of feeling set in in favour of the Mutamid-ud-Diwan and the Saiyid i-Lari. During the months of May and June, whilst the Zill-us-Sultan was acting as Governor-General, the situation in Shiraz, and the surrounding country, improved. The sons of the Qavvam-uLMulk were obliged to leave Persia for Europe. However, on the dismissal of the Zill-us-Sultan, and his replacement by the Asaf-ud-Dauleh, disturbances broke out anew, and the sons of the Qavvam once more returned. On the 30th June the Mutamid-ud-Diwan, who had been appointed over the Arab tribes of Fars, was shot dead by the Arab chief Asghar Khan, who had come to meet him at Saidun, in circumstances of the most revolting treachery. In October the district of Lar was reported to be terrorized by the notorious Mulla Saiyid Abdul Husain, who had announced that to pay revenue to the present Shah was contrary to Islam. Salar-us-Sultan started from Shiraz for Lar on the 21st Nc?ember to deal with absconding debtors and others who had taken refuge there, in spite of receiving warning from the Saiyid that he would not return alive from his expedition. A. force of Arabs under Asghar Khan who were proceeding to join Salar-us-Sultan at Darab sustained a severe defeat en route; whilst at the close of the year it was stated the situation of the Qavvarai brothers in the Darab district was somewhat serious owing to successes of the adherents of the Saiy id-i-Lari; and Salar-us-Sultan, though safe within the walls of Darab, was unable to venture out in any direction. Deports showed that the Lar District was greatly disturbed owing to the Mulla’s adherents having scored a considerable success by treacherously attack ing and killing the sons of the Deputy Governor of Lar, and other notables, during a truce.76 The fighting on the Bushire-Shiraz road, between the adherents of the heads of Kamarii and Dalaki, discontinued since the appointment oftiieZill- us-S alt an, was resumed on the 6 th July. The road thenceforth continued to he in a most unsafe condition, and trade was very considerably impeded. Before the close of the year, owing to the oppression practised upon mule teers by tufangchis and petty headmen, the owners of mule transport deserted the Bushire-Shiraz route for other spheres, and transport had become exceed ingly scarce and expensive. Disturbances in In January it was reported that the inhabitants of Darreh Gaz had arret Gaz. beaten and expelled their Governor, the Jalal-us-Sultan, and that when his brother, the Ain-ul-Mulk, attempted to enter the district to take charge, they also turned him out, looting his baggage. Under orders from Tehran one Hisbmat Khan, son of the old hereditary chief, the Mansur-ul-Mulk, was appointed Governor with orders to punish the rebels, who were, however, said to be prepared to treat him in the same manner as his predecessor. In June the Russian Consul-General at Meshed was said to have written a strong note to the Karguzar to the effect that if order was not speedily restored in Darreh Gaz the Russian Government would take steps to protect its own interests. In July two Russian subjects were killed in the district, and the following month it was reported that the Mansur-ul-Mulk had been appointed as Governor. Disturbances in In February the road from Turbat-i-Etaidari to Yazd was reported to be the Tabas and Tun practically closed by a gang of robbers under the leadership of one Timur Districts. Khan, tu fang da* bashi of the Governor of Tabas. In consequence the merchants of Turbat-i-Haidari decided to stop trading with Yazd, much to their loss, as they are nearly all Yazdis with branches in that town. * In March it was stated that 300 Shirazis were raiding near Tabas. On the 13th September it was reported that the roads between Birjand and Kirman and Yazd were infested with gangs of Shirazi robbers, who had lately looted a Birjand caravan at Tabas, and that trade between those centres was, in consequence, entirely suspended. Disturbances in 26th January, the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that Persian Bucbistan. one of the Baluch chiefs had forcibly suspended the operations of the Customs Department of Chahbar, and was taking the duties himself. A further tele gram was received on the same day reporting similar action by another chief at Gwatar. Finally the chiefs decamped with what money they had been able to seize in the Customs offices, and later in the year the Persian Customs succeeded in re-establishing their offices. From a report dated 27th September, it appeared that Persian Makran was in a very unsettled state, the chief disturbing element being one Haji Nawwab Khan, who, apparently with the support of Sardar Sa’id Khan (Chief of Gaih), was trying to oust Ahmad Khan from the joint chiefship of Bahu. He treacherously murdered Mir Yaghi, eldest brother of Mir Mahmud Khan, chief of Dashtiari, and had thus drawn upon himself the anger of Mir Mahmud Khan. Jalal Khan and Dust Muhammad Khan, brothers of Ahmed Khan, had taken charge of Gwatar, after some slight opposition from the Customs offi cials. Ahmed Khan and his fellow chief, Mir Ashraf, were in possession of the fort in Bahu, while Haji Nawwab Khan retained charge of the fort, 50 miles distant from Ahmad Khan’s fort. In July it was reported that a scheme was afloat in Sarhad, headed by Sardar Bahram Khan, fora revolution to throw off Persian dominion ; and in November it was stated that the Sardar had possessed himself of’all the country lying round Bampur, and was preparing to escalade Bampur fort.This was accordingly subjected to a siege, which was only raised, when the garrison were in great straits, by the arrival of reinforcements ordered there by the Governor of Kirman, Early in January when the Tehran relieved Consular Escort was on its .Attacks on Per- way from Shiraz to Eushire one sowar, who was ahead of his comrades, was Escorts 0 0 c 8 u 1 a r robbed of his rifle, money, and sundry other effects. In March two sowars proceeding on relief from Kirman to India were robbed of their money and property. In June, a daffadar and sowar of the Turbat-i-Haidari escort, who were returning from India, were made prisoners by a large Afghan arms caravan, and marched as far as Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, but were there released. The Afghans took the money in their possession, but allowed them to retain their rifles and camels. A much more serious incident occurred at the racecourse at Gulhak on the 16th September. One of the Indian guards, who were acting as ground police on the course, was attacked by a Persian Cossack who declined to leave the course. The Cossack drew his sword, whereupon he was joined by many of his comrades who attacked the Indian sowars, three of whom were slightly wounded by sword cuts in the melee. The British Military Attache, who was supervising the policing of the ground, called off his men and, although him self attacked by a Cossack, was not hurt. Order was restored by the Kussian Colonel of the Persian Co jsack Brigade appearing on the scene almost imme diately. The man who attacked the Military Attache proved to be the Colonel’s personal orderly. Einally the incident was allowed to close on the Colonel tendering an apology to the British representative. In May it was announced that a formal alliance in writing between the thfESiar^cS Shaikh of Mnhammareh and the Bakhtiari Khans had been concluded. and the shaikh of According to the terms of the agreement they are to act together and their res- Muhammareb - pective tribesmen are to obey the chief of the district, Arab or Bakhtiari, in which they happen to be. I hey will be loyal to the Government and people of Persia so long as there is no interference with the various concessions held by them respectively, or increase in the taxes demanded ; and if such interference or alteration in taxes is made, they will be as one in resisting it. During the first half of the year the Persian press was very outspoken in 1116 Press, its utterances, and it was. evident that the freedom of its opinions was extremely distasteful to the Shah, concerning whom it did not hesitate to write in the most opprobrious terms. The dissemination of this form of literature through the country advanced with leaps and bounds, and it was reported that the reading of the newspapers dealing with the political situation was entirely taking the place of the ancient story-teller of Persia. However, subsequent to the Shah’s coup of the 23rd June the movement was repressed with violence, several of the more noted editors being executed in the Shah’s camp at Bacjh-i-Shah; the Calcutta Habl-ul-Matin was also prohibited from being brought into the country. Towards the close of 1907, the question of the appointment of a foreign ErtaT^TnanLi financial adviser to the Persian Government was mooted. There were two Adviser, candidates for the post, M. Priem, a Belgian with German sympathies, being supported by Germany, whilst M. Bizot was put forward by the Bri tish, .Russian and Ereneh Governments. In January M. Bizot was definitely appointed, as the nominee of the Erench Government. Amongst other ins tructions he was advised to co-ordinate his activity in financial matters to the advice of the British and Russian representatives in Tehran. M. Bizot arrived to take up his post on 22nd March, and was officially attached to the Erench Legation. A month later it was reported that he had given as his opinion thatthe Persian Government was practically at an end of its resources : it also appeared that the Persian authorities were not at all inclined to give him a free hand to do anything to reorganise the finances, and that he had many difficul ties to contend with. In August a detail of the pressing needs of the Persian Government was put as being £400,000, hut M. Pizot stated as his opinion that the list had been drawn up without the smallest regard for the public interest. His own scheme of reform was roughly as follows:— (x) to sweep away Treasurer and mustaufis alike ; ( 2 ) to appoint a small committee of control, nominally subordinate to the Minister of Einance, but really to control his actions ; (3) to make the Customs and Mint subordinate to the Minister of Einance. Activity of Persian In April, a customs launch from Bandar Abbas was seen on the Masqat Customs Launches, ^oast, where it was said that she had followed a dhow which had left Bandar Abbas without a clearance. At the end of May it was reported that the same launch bad proceeded to Basidu and created a disturbance at the British station, about the 19th of the preceding month. Again, in the first week of May the launch from Chahbar wandered, without the slightest excuse, across to the Masqat coast ; and having found a hostile dhow in a bay between Lima and Masandim, seized her and towed her to Bandar Abbas. In June a protest was lodged by the British Representative at Tehran, and the Persian Govern ment was reminded that Persian Customs launches had no right to act in the territorial waters of any Eoreign State unless authorised by Convention, and that on the high seas they could not interfere with any vessels except those carrying the Persian flag. Political. (External.) The Bileh Sowar incident on the Rns- so-Persian Frontier, been The border territory between Azarbaijan and Trans-Caucasia has always in a more or less disturbed state, and bands of brigands have repeatedly come into collision with Russian frontier officials. In spite of frequent Russian representations regarding the activity of marauding Persian bands of robbers violating the Russian border territory, a series of incidents culminated on the 24th of April in a serious collision in which a Russian officer, Captain Dvoyeglasof, and three Cossacks were killed, and others wounded. It appears that the Russian officer’s horse had strayed across the frontier, and that he had proceeded with several Cossacks to recover it: there he was ambushed by a party of Shahsavans, with the result above-mentioned. On the news of this incident reaching the Russian frontier guards, they at once, apparently without official sanction, entered the Persian settlement of Bileh Sowar, slew forty-one of the inhabitants, set fire to the Persian Customs house, took possession of 130 tumans they found there, and committed various other excesses. On reinforcements arriving from Baku, a body of 200 Russian troops invaded Persian territory ia pursuit of the Shahsavans, hut were attacked in superior numbers and forced to retire with loss. On this the Viceroy of the Caucasus, under instruction from St. Petersburg, sent in an ultimatum to the Persian Government, which only reached Tehran on the 18th May, demanding:— (а) Apprehension of those at whose hands the Russian officer died. ( б ) Payment of claims of Russian subjects, according to frontier settlements. (c) Return of deserted Russian soldiers.79 [ ! H ?

Railing compliance with these demands by the 22nd May, it was notified a punitive force under the command of General Snarsky would cross the frontier, to obtain satisfaction by force of arms. The Persian Government accepted in toto the Russian demands, but, as it was impossible that these should be complied with by the date on which the ultimatum expired, it requested, and obtained from the Russian Govern ment, an extension of a fortnight of the time limit. As the Persian Government appeared to be making every effort to satisfy the Russian demands, and as the excesses committed by the Cossacks had un doubtedly put the Russian Government in the wrong, even though the original blame attached to the Persians, it would appear that the incident has been allowed to close. The Russian Government seem to have acted throughout the incident with considerable moderation. Throughout the year the general impression has been that whilst the RtiSio^in Persia. Russian Government has been honestly endeavouring to stand by the terms of the recent Anglo-Russian Convention, yet there have been several instances in which the local agents have not apparently been able to relinquish their former policy towards British interests. Immediately after the Shah’s coup d'etat^ England and Russia became the common object of bitter vilification in the Muhammadan press, and more particularly in the Persian paper of Calcutta, the Habl-ul-Matin, which enjoys perhaps the largest circulation of any Muhammadan paper of the present day. The trend of the articles was to prove that the Anglo-Russian Convention had as its sole object the destruction of Persia in particular, and the Muhammadan world in general ; it was said that the ruin of the Persian National Assembly was only the first move in the game, and that the affair had been arranged at a meeting between King Edward and the Czar of Russia at Revel shortly before the denouement. England was reproached with having deserted the Muhammadan nations, and it w r as suggested that the only recourse of Persia and her co-religonists was to turn to Germany, who it was said had already posed as the champion of Islam on more than one occasion. However, on the publication of the benevolent attitude assumed by Great Britain towards the Turkish Constitution, these attacks were relinquished. In October it was reported that some months previously the Deputy-Gover nor of Sistan had ejected a katkhuda of the village of Gurguri in Sistan, a ^'^Lta^Lofai protege of the Russians, and confiscated his lands on the ground that they had Affairs, been fraudulently acquired. After various corrupt proceedings between the evicted man and the Persian officials, the latter, with the help of the Russian Consul in Sistan and the Russian Legation at Tehran, secured an order from the Minister of the Interior for the restoration of the lands. Thereupon the Deputy- Governor appealed against the order and asked for the assistance of the British Consul in Sistan, who brought the case to the notice of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Representations made on the subject to the Russian Minister point ed out that such interference must inevitably lead to an appeal to the British by the party against whom Russian may intervene. The Russian Minister pro mised to instruct his Consul to act in concert with the British Consul. Latest reports concerning the case state that new orders have been sent reversing those previously sent by the Minister of the Interior.Rebuilding of the In January 1908 the Superintendent of Surveys, Dehra Dun, asked the “-Agent to'tlie Governor-General in Baluchistan for permission to build a survey Maiit Swh. station on the site of the present boundary pillar at Kuh-i-Malik Sian, winch was only a pile of stones. Sanction was granted under the impression that the pillar was merely one of minor importance. It was afterwards discovered, how ever, that the pillar in question was that of the tri-junction of the British, Persian, and Afghan boundaries. Orders were issued, therefore, that it was not to he interfered with, but they arrived too late. The pillar was afterwards re built as nearly as possible identical with the old cairn, but in a very much more solid and permanent manner. sbai P kh iC o£ 0n M 0 uham e On Ihe * completion of the agreement between the Shaikh of Muham- raareh and the Bakh* mareh and the Bakhtiari Khans, an application was made by them to be tiari Khans to be offi- i ii T^roiight under British protection. It was decided that it would he England. undesirable a&amp; present to give the Bakhtiaris any assurances beyond an expression of mendly sympathy; but that in the case of the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, the general assurances already given him might be repeated and extended to his successors, and that it might be further pointed out to him that His Majesty’s Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, which involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country, and includes the continuance of the present state of autonomy possessed by him. Suspicious Russian In June a certain Russian, by name Peodoroff, travelled to Sistan vid raveiier. Birjand. He could speak no Drench and gave himself out to he a doctor; whilst in Sistan he made a tour on the Mian Kangi frontier alone, and subse quently re-visited the same district in company with the Uussian Vice. Consul. He was reported to have visited the frontier from Takht-i-Shah to below Kutak, taking notes and photographs and making sketches. Apparently his original intention was to have proceeded to the Persian Gulf coast at Bandar Abbas, hut sanction was refused by the Russian Minister at Tehran. Pinally he left Sistan to return to Russia, travelling up the Afghan frontier, about the middle of August. On his return journey he gave rise to some anxiety, as it was reported that he had been captured by Afghans. Other information leads to the belief that this man was on some special mission. British and Rus sian Loans. The amount of interest due from the Persian Government in February on the British loan was £13,60U, the interest portion of the instalment which should have been paid in April 1907. On the 18th February £1,300 interest was paid, and the balance on the following day. His Majesty’s Government stated that they were ready to accede to the request of the Persian Government for the suspension for three years of the sinking fund on the loan of 1903-04. In March it was reported that the Imperial Bank had lent sums amounting to £50,000 to the Persian Government for which payment could not be obtained. Foreign Loans. j n j atmaT y the German Charge d’Affaires in the course of a discussion with the British Minister said that in his opinion a foreign loan was absolutely necessary for Persia. The Mushir ud-Dauleh about the same time informed the British Minister that the wish was to raise a sum to consolidate the whole of Persia’s indebtedness (£5,200,000) and to provide a substantial amount to reorganise the general administration and the collection and re adjustment of internal taxation. The Persian Customs, amounting in 1907-08 to £620,000, would be offered as a guarantee for a loan of £7,000,000. A proposal to raise additional revenues (2,500,000 tumans) by an increase of duties on sugar was also brought forward. In July the Persian GovernmeDt was reported to he in the greatest straits for money. In September the British Government declared they were prepared to advance £400,000 in con junction with Russia on certain conditions in case the question were to develop. The Russian Government agreed in principle to the proposal for the joint construction of a railway from Julfa to Muhammareh, and considered that theQuestion was intimately connected with that of an important external loan. Later in the month Mr. Marling pointed out that as long as there was any nrospect of screwing money out of the country, attempts at reform would he resisted, and that therefore we should not only refuse a loan, but seek to increase Persia’s embarrassments by pressing for payment of overdue interest on the 1903*04 loan. ^ f f i c Until recently the service of Uussian. loans had been covered by the rial Bank’s lien on receipt of the important Customs Houses in the Nor th the Caspiantt.

Russia to obtain the reversion of the Kirmanshah revenues, which, though they formed part of the security assigned to Russia, had been taken over y Imperial Bank. A partition of the Kirmanshah receipts was tlie» discussed. The reasons given for transferring the lien of the Imperial BahJ to Bushire were :— **■ * ( 1 ) it was tie only Gulf port suitable for the purpose ; ( 2 ) because the revenues of all other ports pass through it for trans mission to Tehran ; (3) because the only Branch of the Imperial Bank in the Persian Gulf is at Busbire. In Pebruary it was reported that Mr. Uabino bad resigned in consequence of differences of opinion with Mr. Hawkins a member ot the London Board Baut of Pel6ia . of the Bank. In June it was stated that the post had been hlled by Mr. Mood. ..if? 11 'A— Sistan Branch of The Branch has not so far paid its way, in spite of an annual sudsk y, the Imperial 8ank 0 f hut the Indian Government in April recommended the retention of the p,™*. Branch as politically desirable, even if it should be necessary to increase amount of the subsidy, owing to a Russian Bank Branch being there. Viscount Morley questioned the advantage of giving the Branch another two years’ trial, as 'recommended by the Manager of the Bank. Subsequently, however, sanction was given to its retention. 41 the end of January, the British Minister at Tehran, at the request Mmtmg Contract, of the Imperial Bank, applied to the Persian Government for a minting contract Jthe Bank, for the same amount as that spec,fled in the contract concluded in November 1907. The matter was referred to the linanoe Committee of the Assembly, which decided to limit the amount of silver to be coined in one year to two orores of tumans, and this limit had alr^dy been reached Contracts were also made with private bankers. Tne Bank Conces sion was the outcome of an agreement between the Shah Bank, and the latter had the right to com such quantity of the standard cur rency of the country as it deemed necessary to secure its notes, issued m virtue of this concession. The Persian Government at iength _ agreed to conclude contract for the coinage of 500,000 tumans. The Imperial Mint was tarmett out in September to Haji Ismail Agha for 150,000 tumans. This individual bad already been twice convicted of uttering fake coin. In March information was received that the President of the Assembly was of nled-ed to accept assistance from Germany in the establishment of the National Bank. This assistance would entail also rights to concessions. It was suggested that the Russian and English Banks should advance the money Tn order to anticipate the German contemplated action On March 16th the National Assembly passed a bill approving p e *ttled hy i ment on account of the yearly settlement up to n iUEankha no loan from the National Bank of Persia to be started). The Bank has actual existence, and no more mention of it is being made. Throughout the year there has been no further proposal to start a Geiman Bank at Tehran. German Bank Con cession.82 f?firman lien Persian Customs. In February a report appeared in a German paper to the effect that the Shah had promised a subsidy of £2,500 to the German school m lehran, to be guaranteed by a lien on the Customs revenue. This step was regarded as being serious from the British point of view, as it would afford a pretext for interference by Germany in any question of future loans in which the Customs might be offered as security. No further action appears to have been taken since. Plying of German At the close of the previous year it was reported that many dhows in the Sian Guir inthe Persian Gulf were flying the German flag. After due consideration and enquiry by the Political Resident in the Gulf it was decided that representations^ on the subject to the German Government should be postponed for the time being. Tehraf 811 Scbo ° l at 1x1 August His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran considered that it was most desirable that there should be an English school at Tehran to be founded under British auspices. Finally it was decided that nothing could be done in the matter until the Russian opinion was obtained as to whether they would consider such an institution as being an infriugement of the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention. German School at During 1907, as noted in the previous Summary, a German school was started at Tehran, on no very large scale. However, during the early part of the present year through the ofdces of the Ihtisham-us-Sultaneh, the Shah was induced to grant the school a subsidy guaranteed by a lien on the Customs, which materially widened the scope of the school, and thereby its power for disseminating pro-German teachings. F,d i mn Pt Custom In February it was reported that a violent attack had been made on M. Officials hy Germans Mornard, the Belgian Administrator of the Customs, and but for the intervention of the British and Russian representatives, he would have been dismissed from bis post. The opportunity had been utilised by the German Charge d’Affaires to urge the Persian Government to dismiss all Belgians and replace them hy Germans. The German Charge d’Affaires had told his Belgian colleague that the Persian Government had approached him with a request to provide Germans for the purpose. On the matter being referred the Persian Government denied that there was any truth in the matter, or that there was any intention to do as the German Charge d’Affaires had stated. Consular During the year the following changes took place in the British Consular Establishment in Persia. At the end of January it was announced that Sir C. Spring-Rice would not return to his appointment owing to ill-health; Mr. Marling continued to act as Charge d’Affaires. On the 14th July Mr. Barclay, Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople, was appointed Minister at Tehran, and Mr. Marling was transferred to Constantinople. Sir G. Barclay arrived to assume charge of his new duties at Tehran on the 1st October. Lieutenant Ranking, I. A., one of the officers with the Oil Company Escort, was attached to the Consulate at Ahwaz for a period of 5 months from the 6 th June, whilst Captain Lorimer proceeded to Tehran. In consequence of the appointment of a Dutch Consul at Ahwaz, the British Vice-Consulate was raised to the status of a Consulate. Lieutenant Gabriel proceeded on three months' leave in the middle of May, returning to his post early in September. Shortly after he left for India in exchange with Captain Shakespear, handing over charge of the Consulate to the head clerk. Captain Shakespear assumed charge of 'his duties in November. Lieutenant Rae was appointed Personal Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf in May in succession to Captain Birdwood, who proceededIn February Mr. Barnham was transferred to Smyrna and Mr. Isfahan Grahame was appointed to succeed him. The latter assumed charge of his duties on the 13th May, but proceeded to England immediately afterwards on leave, handing over charge of the Consulate-General to Dr. Aganoor. Captain Franklin arrived in Meshed from England on the 21st December Mtshed. 1907 and assumed medical charge of the Consulate*General, Captain Hunter, I.M.S., arrived on the 4th of January in succession to sutan. Captain Kelly, the post having remained vacant for some time. His Majesty’s Consul again spent the hot weather in camp near Birjand. In the middle of April Mr. Grahame was transferred as Consul-General Shiraz, to Isfahan. Mr. Bill assumed charge of his duties as Consul on the 18th April. Captain Watson, I.M.S., took over charge from Captain Keyes on the Turbat-i-Haidari. ISth July, the latter proceeding on leave previous to assuming charge of a new appointment in Baluchistan. Subsequently Captain Grey was appointed to succeed Captain Keyes, and left to assume charge of his appointment in November. In July it was announced that M. Lecomte had arrived in Tehran in place a J 1 r e e b n r c a h nt Minister of M. de la Martiniere. Count Quadt presented his credentials as German Minister at Tehran in ^Tehran. March. , . i j. £ Appointment of In April it was reported that Mr. Krumpeter, the local agent or Agent of a German Messrs. Wonkhaus in Bushire, had been appointed Norwegian Consular ^ e ^ ush ^ epr a e » [Representative at that place. ^ ^waeman During the early part of the year, Baron [Richthofen, the German Charge Foiidcai Relations. d’Affaires at Tehran, exerted himself in every way to interfere in Persian politics. In this he was aided by the fact that Ihtisham-us-Sultaneh, the President of the National Assembly, was very pro-German in his tendencies. However, on his replacement in the spring by Count Quadt attempts to promote German interests were not made in so aggressive a manner; hut, at the same time Mr. Marling reported that the new German Minister took every oppor tunity to sow the seeds of distrust of Great Britain and Russia in the hearts of the Persians. Military. In February it was reported that the Russian Goyernment were going to replace the late Captain Dental by a Colonel Von der Flans of the General Staff. At first it whs considered that this was an innovation, but it was finally explained that had the late Military Attache lived a few ^ months more he would have been of the same rank as the new officer appointed to the post. His Majesty’s Government were of opinion that we should attempt to induce the Russian Government to forego their intention, and, for this purpose were prepared to offer to withdraw the British Military Attache from Meshed. Einally, however, on the recommendation of the Indian Government, it was decided to accept the appointment rather than run any risk of having to withdraw the Military Attache at Meshed. Accordingly Colonel Von dei Elaas arrived in Sistan early in August to take up his appointment. Erom reports he appears to be on bad terms with his Russian confreres. Throughout the year the Shiraz Consular Escort has been maintained at Escon ? 2 double its ordinary strength, owing to the disturbed state of the town. In Sent ember His Majesty’s Government intimated that they approved Bandar a bba« of the inci e se of the Bandar Abbas Consular Escort by 16 infantrymen as a Consulai - Ex temporary measure for three years.

In January a sowar of the Kirman escort had to be dismissed from the service for actilg in a most insubordinate manner. The man was a Sikh. In August it was reported that the escort at Isfahan was showing conduct verging on rnutioy, owing' to discontent with their ration allowance. The whole detachment was finally relieved by fresh men from India. Knssian Consular rj] ie on } v important increase in the Russian Consular Escorts was that of E8Cort9 ' Tabriz which was raised from a strength of 25 to 50 : two machine guns were also sent with the reinforcement. Communications. A.— Railways. , Constmctinn The question of the construction of an Anglo-Russian Railway hetweon Augio Russian Rail- j u ]f a and Mnhammareh formed the subject of conversation betvv n way between Juifa , R ia x^orei^n Ministers during the exchange of visits between the King and the Emperor of Russia at Revel. M. Isvolsky intimated that he ap proved of the proposal. Subsequently the Russian Government communicated a memorandum in which it was stated that the Russian Government agreed m principle to a line from Juifa to Muhammareh, and that they were prepared to enter into exchange of views as to practical details, and also would he ready to free the Persian Government from obligation to abstain from giving conces sions before 1910. The Russian Government, however, being unable to furnish capital themselves, would be ready to settle the financial side of the question with Great Britain. The Russian Government also proposed to join the line with Tehran and to link up Tehran with Rasht and Enzali. Furthermore, the necessity of constructing a line from Askhabad to Meshed would have to be considered. In order to preserve Russian interests in the north it would also probably be necessary to examine the question of freight rates on the Muham mareh line. To this memorandum a reply was given in October in which it was stated that His Majesty’s Government considered that some mis-apprehen- sion appeared to have arisen in regard to the precise nature of the British pro posals. In approaching the Russian Government actual construction was not contemplated, but rather timely co-operation in ear marking concessions which otherwise might be exploited to the detriment of Great Britain and Russia. B .—Postal Service. The Sistan Postal Contract. At the close of 1907 the Sistan Postal Contract was given to one Pasand Khan, a Russian protege, by the Persian administration. His Majesty’s Consul in Sistan thereupon protested, and urged that the contract should be cancelled on the ground of the past misconduct of Pasand Khan’s men, between whom and some of our Escort sowars there had been a fracas in the past year. Finally the contract was terminated in April on the Persian Government undertaking’not to employ Pasand Khan and his tribesmen in the future. C.— Telegraphs. Exdmngp of the In a despatch dated the 16th January, the Government of India suggested Menhed-sistan and to His Majesty’s Government that as it seemed unlikely that a favourable oppor- Lines' an Tele ^ U11 ^y wou ^ P reseilt ^ tse ^ an ear ty ^ ate ^ ov givi 11 ' formal effect to the arrangement with Russia regarding the exchange of the telegraph lines in Persia ; and as, in view of the fact that reports received since the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement show that Russian control is being further ex tended over the Meshed-Shtan line, it would be greatly to British interests that this control should cease at an early date, the object aimed at in the agreement might he sufficiently secured if Great Britain and Russia transferred informallyik\\ sseifci; 1 Sill, iflg CMfe was {lit 'gUOSIJ befrac the M ^een tk t Iieap- Mica ted Teed in •ared to idy to onces- irnish istion line moie, i Vo 'be Ad. also kliam- /liicli it pptehen- ■isb. ptO' was aot ns wMct assia. 85 to one another, without reference to the Persian Government, the control which they exercised respectively over the Tehran-Meshed and Meshed-Sistan lines. Subsequently it was agreed that, the suggestion made by the British repre sentative at Tehran should he accepted : that the best way to obtain the assent of the Persian Government to the transaction would he to represent it as one to which the British and Russian Governments had agreed as a mere matter of convenience and economy, and not as a complement of the Anglo-Russian Convention; and that the Representatives at Tehran were to take the necessary action as soon as possible. The subject now resolved itself into three different points for settle ment— ( 1 ) The broaching of the subject to the Persian Government. (2) Whether either Power should maintain signallers within the othePs sphere. (3) Whether the management of the British section of the line should be entrusted to the Indian Telegraph Department or to the Indo- European. On the 25th April it was reported that the German Minister at Tehran had learnt of the projected exchange, and on this account it was considered desirable that the matter should be dealt with at an early date. On the 20th of the following month the Persian Telegraph Administration was informed of the proposed exchange. The reply given was that the matter was of such importance that it should be discussed by the two Legations with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Subsequently violent articles on the subject appeared in the Persian papers. Further discussion of the subject with the Persian Government was postponed owing to the chaotic state of affairs in the capital, and their sanction yet remains to be obtained. Finally it was arranged in September that each Power should withdraw all its mechanicians and inspectors from the line controlled by the other, but that Great Britain should retain her signallers at Tehran and Meshed and Bussia hers at Birjand and Nasratabad (Sistan). A draft memorandum detailing the proposed exchange was communicated to the Russian Government, but this draft cannot come into force until such time as the consent of the Persian Government may have been obtained. en to ® .8 MajestJ it should! .ban’s mt s m the ft jOYernfflf future, effect In April the Government of India agreed that the Indian Telegraph Department should accept the transfer of the Khaf-Nasratabad line, pending arrangements with the Indo-European Telegraph Department. His Eritannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran recorded bis opinion that if the latter Depart ment were not allowed to assume control of this section, our chance of obtain ing the extension to Robat would he seriously minimised. In July it was reported from Tehran that owing to the had working of the M ahammLh^Borit 0 Muhammareh-Borazjun telegraph line under Persian control it was possible that jua Telegraph Line the control of the line might be obtained by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. After some discussion it was decided that an attempt should ment. be made to secure this object, and that the cost of the undertaking should be borne in equal shares between the Imperial and Indian Treasuries. Finally on the 3rd September instructions were issued to the Director at Tehran to open negotiations with the Persian Minister of Telegraphs, with a view to obtaining control of the line for the Department. The negotiations w T ere to be opened on the following basis, the Director to ask the Minister of Telegraphs— ( 1 ) what lump sum he would he prepared to give for the purpose of putting the line in order; ( 2 ) what annual contribution he would he willing to make towards the upkeep of the line;86 ( 3 ) for what length of time he would be prepared to agree to the control of the line remaining in our hands. The less the Minister would be prepared to do under (1) and (2), the more could be asked for under (3). bbi n c»We Bandar The question of the opening of the telegraph office still remains unsettled. The end of the cable is still accommodated in a small hut opposite to the new British Consulate. D.— Hoads. Faiang Kut Route During the year there have been discussions concerning the construction of a route fromltobat to Neh via the Palang Kuh by the Persian Government; but beyond orders being issued nothing has been accomplished. Luristan Concessit ns. During the year His Majesty’s Consuls at Ahwaz and Kirmanshah have continued to advocate the construction of a trade route from the Karun to Kirmanshah. A concession for such a route is held by the Persian Transport Company, but they say they are not to blame for not having availed themselves of their rights up to date, as the country traversed has been so disturbed that the Persian Government has confessed its inability to maintain order. The Bakhtiari Road Concession. Throughout the year the usual differences between Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. and the Bakhtiari Khans, on the subject of the settlement of the various dues in connection with the maintenance of the Bakhtiari Hoad from Ahwaz to Isfahan, continued to be a source of endless correspondence. However, the Bakhtiari Khans were induced by the tact of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to disburse money in settlement of some of the long outstanding accounts. E.— Rivers, Coicessbn ! 18411011 Attempts to obtain the settlement of the reimbursement on the deficits involved in working the “ Shushan ’* for the Persian Government by Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. have been fruitless. Building operations by Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. at Shalili having been interfered with by the local authorities, the matter has become one for representation at Tehran. New Persian Steamer for use on the Karun River. In Eebruary it was reported that a new twin-screw steamer had been brought from Manchester in sections for the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s Company at Bandar Nasiri, for use on the upper Karun. Later it was rumoured that the Company intended to clear out the channel of the river for the use of the new steamer from Shalili to Shushtar. ing 0 ste S am 0 n Laun F che 8 I n March it w r as reported that a concession for placing steam launches on on Late Urumich. Lake Urumieh was held by Prince Iman Quli, and that it had been granted to him prior to the agreement between England and Bussia. Eussia had offered to take part in this concession, but had met w ith a refusal. It was now asked whe ther there would be any objection to Messrs. Stevens of Manchester becoming partners in the enterprise. The matter was then referred to the Russian Govern ment who replied that a rigorous application of the Anglo-Russian Convention was most desirable, and that therefore it would be preferable that Messrs. Stevens’ request^ should be refused. In August, however, the British Charge d’Affaires gave his opinion that there was no reason why Messrs. Stevens should not be allowed to do as proposed; but it was decided by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in November that His Majesty’s Government could not approve Messrs. Stevens even managing the business for the present concession aire, as this was considered ^ ^ ~ * i ----- Convention, inconsistent with the spirit of the Anglo-Bussian F.— Maritime. Ameri^S’ of, In Mareh the Political Resident in Baghdad reported that he had a call German steamers to from a Mr. laust Laurion, who described himself as an Austrian, naturalised in the Persian Gulf. *England, and as a Director of the West Hartlepool Line of Steamers. He said that according to his calculations the Hamburg-American Line must be losing about £ 20,000 a year on their Persian Gulf service. He said that he had been negotiating on behalf of the British Combine with the Hamburg- American Directorate, and he thought that before long an agreement would be come to by which the British steamers would not go to Hamburg, Antwerp, or Potter dam, and the German steamers would not goto Marseilles or any port in the United Kingdom, Commercial. Throughout the year reports have been continually received from all parts Trade 1D Per8ia ‘ of the country regarding the influence which the present state of disorder has bad on trade operations. Rates have everywhere ruled high on account of the increased risks and delays in transit. The trade reports of the Nushki- Sistau trade route alone show an improvement, and this is probably due to the reason that the trade of the other parts of the country has suffered from the disturbed condition of affairs ; trade being thus more and more deflected to the relatively quiet eastern frontier, with its outlet into British territory. In April it was reported that the Persian Customs had produced a sum of PerBian Cu9tom8 - £602,207, after the deduction of the expenses of administration, thus showing an increase of £100,633 on the profits for the previous year. German Commercial aims in Persia have been marked throughout the year cI ® er Ea n terpre ,ne i r ; by the activity of German travellers ; but even more by the series of articles p tr 3 i a . which have been constantly appearing during the period under review in the various official and un-official German organs. In April it was reported that an application was being lodged with the J ** 1 0iide Persian Government for a concession to the red oxide rights on the Island of Sirri, situated in the neighbourhood of Lingeh. The intending Concessionaires were the firm of Haji All Akbar &amp; Sons, Limited, of Manchester, but the appli cation was entered through their Tehran agent in his capacity as a Persian sub ject. After a certain amount of discussion, a certificate was obtained from the firm, to the effect that should a concession be granted it would be controlled in British interests and would not be shared with any foreigners. The matter, however, remains more or less in statu, quo owing to a long-standing dispute as to the ownership of the island. Towards the close of 1907 it was reported that the Muin-ut.Tujjar, the Oxide Concessionaire of the Hormuz red oxide, was contemplating raising money by selling his concession. With the object of preventing the concession falling into the hands of a foreign firm, endeavours were made to effect an agreement between Messrs. Ellinger, the Agents of the Muin-ut-L'ujjar, and Messrs. Strick ; however, negotiations came to a standstill as it was considered that the terms asked were too high. In August it was reported that the Persian Gov ernment contemplated the raising of money by cancelling the concession and then selling it again. Early in September it was intimated that the Germans had made an offer of £300,000, less interest at 4 per cent, for a grant of the concession for a period of 12 years. A protest against this proposal was lodged immediately by the British Representative at Tehran, Later in the same month, the Muin-ut-Tujjar evinced a wish to agree to the forming of his con cession into a company in co-operation with Messrs. Ellinger under certain conditions with regard to British protection. At the end of May it was reported that oil had been struck at the D’Arcy ca £ Arcy 0l1 Syndl ’ Oil Syndicate camp at Maidan-i-Minuftun at 1,200 feet, and that a spout was rising to a height of 75 feet above the ground. A further report stated that the oil was of good quality, and is already used for lime-burning. The flowwas at tliat time about 20,000 gallons per diem, and it was expected that the output would be greater as soon as the boring could be deepened. At the close of 1907 the Consular Escort at Ahwaz was increased by 20 Indian sowars and two British oflicers to act as a guard oyer the Oil Company’s works. This guard was continued throughout the year, towards the end of which the question of building permanent quarters for the men was raised. Early in the year after the arrival of the Indian Guard the Bakhtiari Khans evinced a desire to carry out their promises made to the Oil Com pany, and during thev remainder of the year no difficulties on that score were experienced. f In July it was reported that the Oil Syndicate would probably want to acquire ground on Abbadan Island, opposite Muhammareb, for the location of their oil reservoirs. During the year under review the arms traffic through Persia to Afghanistan assumed a most serious aspect, being carried out on a consider ably larger scale than in the past. The Consular Trade Report forMasqat for 1905-06 gives the total value of the arms trade during that year as Bs. 1,071,380, whilst that of 1907-08 shows it as Rs. 4,185,390. it is apparent that the coming of the Hamburg-American steamers to the Gulf has given an immense impetus to the trade from the Continent, and that a greater proportion of the trade is falling into the hands of non-English manufacturers. The Navy have made great efforts to stop the trade at sea between Masqat and the Persian coast, and these have been ably seconded by information derived from a chain of posts connected by telephone along the Indo-European Telegraph line, inaugurated under the supervision of Mr. New of that Department. However, the results obtained were small; a couple of dhow r s were captured, and the cargoes of a few more thrown overboard. On the 22nd Jd ay a boat belonging to H.M S. “Proserpine” having approached the Makran coast in pursuit of a dhow, was fired on and two British blue-jackets lost their lives. At this time it was reported that the Afghan arms-runners in the neighbourhood of the Makran coast totalled a couple of thousand men. As it was feared that an attempt might be made to avenge the loss suffered from the capture made by the “ Proserpine ” by an attack on the British station at Jashk, a detachment of men was landed at that place from the “ Proserpine, ” but w 7 as shortly after wards replaced by a detachment of 50 Native Infantry from India. At the end of Hay the Robat detachment was increased by a force of 50u men, owing to rumours that the gun-runners intended to revenge themselves on the post. The Persians were at the same time induced to send out armed men from JSistan, Bam, etc , to attempt to stop the caravans, but the results accomplished by this means were nil. It is true that the Persian force from Sistan did cut off the heads of a couple of stragglers they found from one of the caravans, but the effect of this was only to incense the Afghans and to lead them to talk of taking revenge on the Persians in Sistan, Besides the capture by the Navy of the couple of dhows already mentioned nothing was attained in the way of stopping the caravans, which were enabled to reach Afghanistan in safety. One caravan was reported to have consisted of over 1,000 camels, with about 750 men, carrying about 12,000 rifles and 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition. It was estimated that at least 30,000 rifles and three million rounds of ammunition were imported into Afghanistan during the first half of the year. In June it uas reported that the arms caravans had all left the coast and that the greater number had arrived at their destinations. The activity of the mem of-war was therefore relaxed and the Jashk reinforcement withdrawn. The Robat re inforcement was withdrawn about August. At the commencement of the winter and also of the arms-running season, the question of taking steps to stop the trade again arose, but it was decided that unless the trade could be stopped at Masqat itself by diplomatic arrangement, the only course open was that of N aval operations on a considerably larger scale. The Jashk garrison was, how ever, reinforced by 50 men about the middle of November as a precautionarymeasure, and arrangements were made to provide Mr. New with an escort of Baluch levies on his annual inspection of the line in November. Major Grey, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Masqat, and Commander f er encl se!sArmsC ° n Bowman, R.N., late Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, were deputed by the Government of India to attend the Arms Conference which assembled at Brussels on the 28th April. The Conference continued to sit until the 16th July, when it was adjourned to November, and, subsequently, to the autumn of 1909. As regards the stopping of the Arms trade from Masqat, nothing was accomplished, owing to the position adopted by the Prench Government. How- ever, Prance intimated privately that she would be prepared to discuss the ques tion’subject to certain conditions of receiving &amp; quid tyro quo to compensate her for the heavy loss she would sustain by the prohibition of the Masqat Arms Trade. Climate and Health. On the 4th March Captain M. P. White, I.M.S., arrived in Bushireto Mobile ' Assistant to assume charge of his duties as Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer - in the Persian Gulf. Gulf. At the end of August it was reported that the Russian Consul at Turbat-i- Qu c ^fJ f ^flt Haidari when on tour at Turshiz closed the quarantine post there, and brought i ul 8 biz. in the sowars to Zehrmehr, situated 16 miles from Turbat-i-Haidari. TURKEY-IN-AS! A, Political. The Turkish encroachments on Persian territory have lue i unvisu * continued through. Pr o n t ie r r dispute™ out the year, and the prospects of the dispute being settled appear to be little better than they were twelve months ago. The Persian Commissioner, the Muhtashim-us-Sultaneh, after many delays, finally started from Tehran and arrived at Urumieh on 22nd November 1907. In December a force of about 3,000 men under the Pirman Pirma, who had been sent to keep order in the neighbourhood of the Irontier, was surrounded in Suj Bulak at the instigation of Tarzil Pasha, commanding the Turkish troops at Pasveh. The Kurdish attack on the town was repulsed^ by the Persians, on which 800 Turks and 6 guns moved from Pasveh to the neigh- bourhood. The inhabitants of Suj Bulak were then informed that the town would he bombarded unless the town was evacuated by the Persian troops. Seeing that he had no chance of success against the Turkish troops, the Iir- man Pirma thereupon withdrew to Miandoab. Towards the end of January the British Ambassador at Constantinople was informed that the Persian protest w r as not justifiable, as the action of the lurkish genera was no ling more than a benevolent assistance offered with a view to helping the lirman Pirma out and quieting the Kurds. In January the Turkish Commissioner, Taher Pasha, went with an escort of fifty Turkish soldiers to the village of Balu, six miles to the north-west of Urumieh. There he was joined by the Persian Commissioner on 4th Jammy 1908. Meetings of the Commission were held on various occasions during Pehruary, and a memorandum was submitted by -Taher Pasha stating the treaties on which he relied. The meetings then cease , u an mere an^eo memoranda took place in which a definite Turkish demand was made that Persian interference with Turkish tribes and m the territories of the district of Kharput, embracing the country between Bayazid and Sulaimameh, cease. Taher Pasha towards the end of February communicated to the British Consul-General at Urumieh that he had convinced himself that So] Bulak belonged to Turkey, and that he considered his mission accomplished90 he had reduced the question to the interpretation to be placed on Article III of the Treaty of Erzeroum, and that only the two Governments were competent to decide this. Having arrived at this conclusion Talier Pasha proceeded to withdraw from Urumieh to Pasveh, but on 3rd March received orders from the {Sultan to return and resume negotiations. Meanwhile a state of anarchy existed in the disputed areas, the Kurds, hacked up and encouraged by the Turks, over-running the country in all directions. The result was the submission of many Persian villages to the Turkish authorities. -At the same time a considerable increase of Turkish troops was reported at Tergavar. On 22nd May the village of Shaitanabad was surrounded by an army of Kurds estimated at 4,000, and surrendered. Mr. 'Wratislaw was of opinion that a general forward movement of Turkish troops was to be feared, and that Taher Pasha was deliberately postponing his arrival in order to facilitate the event. On the 4th June Taher Pasha arrived at Mavana, where the British and Kussian Consuls called upon him in order to olfer a remonstrance on the dis turbed condition of the frontier districts, and on the Kurdish atrocities, for which they held that he, as representative of the Turkish Government, was responsible. Taher Pasha, however, only gave some vague assurances. Eor the next fortnight he continued to say that he would intervene, and was even taken down a part of the frontier by Mr. Wratislaw and shown evidences of the raids : nevertheless, he took no action, remarking that the raids were instigated by the Persians in order to involve him in trouble. On 5th July the Persian Commissioner presented a memorandum to Taher Pasha giving his views on the Treaty of Erzeroum ; he also claimed dam iges for Turkish aggression and demanded the recall of Turkish troops. To this Taher Pasha replied that the Persians originally took away Turkish territory, seduced the Kurds from their allegiance, and deceived the Commission appointed to enquire into the matter. Early in July the British Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to support a Russian representation to the Shah to the effect that joint inquiry by the Russian and British representatives at Urumieh had proved that the Kurds were responsible for the recent outrages and that the Turks were entirely responsible for the conduct of tbe Kurds : also that it was necessary that the Porte should take action without delay to put an end to this intolerable state of things. On 13th July the British and Russian representatives made a combined representation to the Porte. The Grand Vizir expressed his ignorance of barracks being built at Mavana, but said he had issued orders that the Kurds were to be restrained from advancing into Persian territory. Under the advice of the British and Russian representatives in Tehran it was not at first considered desirable to communicate to the Persian Govern ment the result of the representations to the Porte ; however, on 15th July, in consequence of a report that Persia had applied to Germany for support against the Turks, it was thought expedient that the steps taken should be communicated at Tehran. Action was eventually postponed. The Turkish Military Attache at Tehran boasted to the British Charge d’Affaires that “ a powerful friend ” was urging on Turkey. On 18th July Kulunji, a village 20 miles north of Urumieh, was occupied by Turkish soldiers, and letters were sent to various villages intimating that they had been annexed by Turkey. The Turkish Commissioner pleaded igno rance of this action, and on inquiry it was found that the troops had acted under the orders of Yaver Pasha, the Military Commander. Eour days after wards lahei 1 asha said that the troops had been sent to Kulunji by mistake, and that they would be withdrawn. Mr. Wratislaw gave as his opinion that Taher Pasha had little control over Yaver Pasha, and that the latter should be removed if aggression were to cease. The Turkish troops were subsequently retired about 6 miles from Kulunji into the Somai district; and the Dool district being also evacuated, was immediately reoccupied by the Persians.Weiej.j 5 from | 16 hi tr yiaaS «to | Turfet abad ws ad. k ib trooji ! animal sb and be di$. es, for it, was Por eyeii if tiie fated 'hr %es his y } d 1U0 y''i airds iirely t tlie state ibinecl :ee oi Kurds iran it ioveru* fuly.in support ould be Charge r§ after juisfeit lioa ^ 1 bool^ miM be ^ 91 On 11th August Yarer Pasha with two companies was reported to have entered the Baranduz District and to have ordered the people to cease paying taxes to the Persian Government. In reply to a remonstrance made by the Persian Commissioner, Taher Pasha said that he had sent the troops to keep order, and that Anzel and Western Baranduz were Turkish territory. He further claimed that he was entitled to send troops to any part of the disputed districts. On 18th August Taher Pasha informed the Persian Commissioner that Turkey claimed all the territory claimed by the Dervish map, with the excep tion of Kotur; hut in addition Sakiz, Baneh, Solduz and Suj Bulak. On the same day Izzet Pasha replaced Eazil Pasha at Pasveh in command of the troops, and the latter proceeded to take command of the Army Corps at Baghdad. . Taher Pasha informed Mr. Wratislaw confidentially that on 12th August Yaver Pasha had received instructions from the Minister of War to advance no further. On 2 l*th August Taker Pasha claimed a frontier for the Vilayat of Baghdad which included the Karun from Muhammareh to Kut-ul-Abid. He added that he recognised neither zone nor status quo. At this time Turkish officials were reported to he collecting tithes from the Anzel District. , On 26th August Taher Pasha received instructions to proceed to Bitlis to resume his appointment as Yali of that place; the Presidency of the Frontier Commission being handed over to Daniel Pasha. On the following day the Turkish Commission withdrew from Urumieh. On 29th August the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the British Ambassador that the Porte had decided to restore the status quo on the frontier, and that most of the troops would he withdrawn, Pasveh and all places east of the zone, as also places incontestably Persian, being evacuated. Throughout September the question of an identic alcommunication being made to the Shah by the Russian and British representatives at Tehran was allowed to stand over pending definite news of the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from the neighbourhood of the frontier. On 25th September the British Consul at Mosul reported that two bat talions of Turkish troops had arrived at Mosul from the frontier and that an other was expected. Five other battalions from the frontier were also reported to have started for Bitlis. However, on 11th October Mr. Wratislaw reported that apparently ^ the Turkish withdrawal of troops had been stopped and that small bodies remained in all the districts previously occupied. On 26th October the British Minister at Constantinople reported that a Commission bad been formed at the Foreign Ministry, which, with the assis tance of two Staff Officers and an unofficial Delegate from the Persian Embassy, would examine the question of the frontier represented by the status quo of three years ago. This was mainly owing to the urgent representations of the British Minister. In the early months of the year a more than usual amount of unrest and c ”; insubordination occurred in the Turkish army, especially in the 2nd and 3rd effect in the Asiatic Army Corps in Macedonia. Affairs were brought to a head on the 3 rd of July,P rovinc&lt; ». when a large number of officers and men of these Corps took to the hills near Monastir, and announced that they wanted justice for everyone, irrespective of race or creed. Their programme was the enforcement of the Constitution of 1876, and a Parliament in which all races and creeds should be represented ; the admission of Christians as well as Turks to the army; and the appointment of Christians and Turks alike to all offices. This mutiny assumed large propor tions, the troops sent to quell the rebellion themselves refusing to march. is.VKv 92 At this iuncture the Saltan decided to grant a Constitution and on 28tli At tms juiiutui , K - orail &amp; sreneral amnesty was grant- July he took the oath of fidelity tbe “ o{ f f on „ ge was aMished* At ed to all PoW'cal offenders and ^h^^yste^ot were d;smissed A htrTMtotry was formed under the leadership of Kiamil Pasha, which included both Armenians and Greeks. Inthe Asiatic provinces of Turkey the granting of the Constitution was received with a certain amount of suspicion, but when it was found that the changes were permanent, great rejoicings were held, which were shared by Moslems and Christians alike. The opportunity was taken to S et T ld of ^nox^us officials. In a few places, such as Mosul, where the Moslems and Christians are in the proportion of ten to one, many were much opposed to changes which they thought would be a danger to Moslem supremacy Com- mitte°es of Union and Progress were formed at all the chiet towns, but these as a rule have not performed much, confining their efforts mostly to the dismissal of officials objectionable to themselves. At Baghdad a local Committee was formed and in October representatives of the Chief Toung Turkey Committee from Salonica arrived. During the reading of an address by them in a mosque, it was affirmed that the mosque was defiled D bv the presence of Jews and this was taken as an excuse for a serious attack on them, in which some 2,000 are reported to have been more or less seriously injured. Later, however, matters quieted down and there have been no disturbances since. In the Armenian districts many of the revolutionaries have made their submission, and a sense of security is prevalent such as has not been known for many years. The only place where matters are not entirely satisfactory is Smyrna. Here there appear to be continual strikes and violence of every kind, the most serious of the former being that on the Smyrna-Aidin railway. Latest reports, however, state that even here the situation is much improved. Disturbances iu Throughout the year under review the districts of Van and Bitlis continued tbe Van and Bitlis a gtate 0 j; o^eraf disorder; reports were continually received of horrible viiajata. atrocities indicted on the defenceless Armenian villagers at the hands of the Kurds. The British Vice-Consul at Van reported at various times that he consider ed that the Armenian population was being systematically oppressed by the Turks with the specific strategic object to replace them by a Muhammadan population. It appeared to him that the Mush Plain, Balanuk, Akhlat and Khunis districts were of great strategical importance considered in relation to Russia, and that there was every indication of an intention to make a Turkish military base at Mush. The principal means of oppression employ ed were heavy taxation, without any compensating justice or security for life or property, and bad administration; prohibition to Armenians to leave the country in search of work; unrestrained tyranny and pillage by Kurds, encour aged by the Government. Early in February a member of the Armenian Fedai, or revolutionaries, in Van, named David, furnished information against his comrades, and in con sequence large quantities of arms and ammunition were seized by the Vali. On the 6 th February fighting between the Fedai and the troops became general. During the course of the next few days, owing to the efforts of the various Consuls, matters quieted down somewhat. On 23rd March the informer David was shot whilst standing in the company of an officer of gendarmerie. The assassin escaped, but the Turks commenced a general attack on all the Armenians who happened to be in the bazar, with a result that practically none of them escaped. The news spread quickly through the town and a general massacre of Armenians began, which was only ended by the firmness and efforts of the officer commanding the troops, who finally succeeded in dispersing the Muslim bands. Notwithstanding his efforts, however, several Armenians were murdered in various parts of the town that night. DuringI 93 ution ns that! ibarei fe of n; lems ail iposed t« r .

Within the course of the next few weeks large numbers of troops arrived in the town, and it became apparent that the Government intended to take energetic measures against the Fedai, and not against the Armenian popula tion in general. In the middle of May the Turkish troops surrounded the Armenian quarter, and a proclamation was made demanding the surrender of all the members of the revolutionary party, and also of all arms and ammunition. However, as there was no mention of an amnesty the demand was fruitless. Pour days later a systematic search of the quarter by the troops commenc ed, and was carried out‘in a most praiseworthy and orderly manner Twelve of the leading Fedai were found in a drain, amongst them being Aram, the leader of the movement. This policy of systematic search was continued without interruption, until, by the end of June, it was reported that few Fedai remained in Yan. During the course of operations there were one or two occasions on which shots were exchanged between the revolutionaries and the troops, and some of the former succeeded in making good their escape. Search was also instituted in the surrounding district, and during this several outrages were reported to have taken place. In the vilayat of Bitlis efforts were made to stamp out the Armenian revolutionary party, but the work was entrusted to the Kurds,^ who were responsible for numerous atrocious acts in its execution. Ihe chief offender was reported to be one Kasim Bey, who made a practice of visiting the Armenian villages in the district, and of extracting money and valuables from the innocent inhabitants whilst committing various excesses at their expense. The different Consuls continued to make every representation to the authorities, and notes were addressed by the Foreign Embassies to the Porte itself; but in spite of promises of improvement, and of the arrest of the worst offenders among the Kurdish officers, nothing has been done. In August the Government ordered steps to be taken to arrest Ibrahim Pasha, the famous chief of the Milli Kurds. The local British representa tives gave their opinion that the arrest of this man wuuld have an excellent effect throughout the disturbed districts. Some time previously Ibrahim Pasha had volunteered to go down with his Kurds to protect the Hijaz railway from the Bedouin attacks. On arrival at Damascus Government rifles were issued to his men. Subsequently he exhibited a disinclination to go further, and finally turned back towards the north. At the end of August he moved east from Aleppo with 600 men, whereupon troops were despatched to intercept him. He then crossed the Euphrates and moved on Tel Akbmar. About the end of the first week in September he reached Yiranshehr, where his force swelled to 4,000 men. Operations being under taken on a large scale against him, he solicited the good offices of the British Embassy at Constantinople. Subsequently he was offered terms of surrender, but towards the end of the month he died in the neighbourhood of Yiranshehr. His following at the time were between Zor and Nisibin, and were apparently suffering severely at the hands of the local tribesmen who had turned against them. The districts in the neighbourhood of the Tigris have been in a very th disturbed condition throughout the year, the most important incident as regards ra tes. &amp; British interests being an attack made by the local inhabitants on a British steamer. On 2nd April Messrs. Lynch and Co.’s steamer the “Blosse Lynch” was fired on soon after leaving Amarah. Three passengers, including one woman who subsequently died, and one fireman, were wounded. Soon after the occur rence the vessel brought up alongside a Turkish encampment, when the Captain, accompanied by Captain McConaghey, the acting Hesident at Baghdad,94 who was on board, went ashore and reported the incident to the Colonel in command of the troops. The latter was informed that the vessel carried the mails and must proceed to Basrah as soon as possible. Some soldiers were then placed on board, and the Turkish gunboat “ Alus ” was also ordered to accom pany the vessel, which continued on her journey. Shortly after she started the Arabs opened fire fora second time, and the tiring continued for about half an hour. In reply to a remonstrance lodged at Constantinople the British repre sentative was informed that all possible measures were being taken to maintain the security of navigation, that troops had been sent to the scene of the occur rence, and that an inquiry was to be held with a view to punishing the guilty parties. On 13th April, the British Consul at Basrah reported that British and Turkish steamers were again running. The whole incident was held to be due to an attempt of the Arabs to attract British attention to their grievances against the Turkish Government. The immediate cause, however, was that the lands at Majar Saghir were formerly leased to a brother of Gadban, Shaikh of the BanL Lam, named Taileh. Nazim Pasha gave the lease to one Abul Nefise, a Najdi and an out sider, in the face of local opposition, and endeavoured to instal him in his hold ing by armed force. The project, however, could not be effected. The Turkish authorities explained that the sudden attack on the steamer was due to the Arabs being under the impression that Nefise was on board her. The Consul was of opinion that this view might be a plausible excuse, from the Arab point of view, for the first attack, as Nefise was on the river at the time and was actually proceeding to Majar Saghir in a sailing vessel, accompanied by Turkish soldiers, to take over his new leasehold; but that it did not explain the second attack after the vessel had left the Turkish camp, and the scene of the dispute. Taher Pasha, the Commandant, informed the British Consul on 13th April that the cause of the trouble had been removed by the cancellation of the objectionable lease, that the river was quiet, and that there was nothing more to be feared. But Mr. Crow considered that, unless some drastic steps were taken, there was no doubt that the Arabs would resort to similar methods to gain their ends in the future. Although the local strong British representatives were of opinion that representations should be made to the Turkish Government, it was decided that for various reasons it would be inadvisable to press the claim. Finally when Messrs. Lynch asked that a claim for damages and compensation should be presented to the Turkish Government, they were advised by His Britannic Majesty’s Government not to attempt to gain more than the recovery of actual loss suffered. The reasons given were that the Company were trading under a somewhat anomalous position flying the flag of one nation in the territory of another, and that considering the state of flux in which the Turkish Govern ment was at the time it would be unwise to draw attention to such a state of affairs, which might result in the cancellation, or modification, of the conces sion under which the Company’s steamers were allowed to ply on the river. On 13th August, it was reported that there had been fighting among the Arabs on the Tigris, and that the Euphrates and Tigris 1 Steam Navigation Company s steamer the “Khalifah” with the downward mail, had been detained at Kut, as the Vali considered that it was not safe for the vessel to proceed. On the 14th, Sir E. Grey instructed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople to ask the Grand Vizir to take such steps as were required to restore order, and to afford protection to the “ Khalifah.” On the 17th, the Political Tlesident in Turkish Arabia reported that, on a favourable received from the Vali, the steamer continued her voyage to caught the English mail. In connection with this disturbance, were said to have gone to Ali Gharbi from Amarah. , a ’ owards tte end of August the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia took advantage of an opportunity to intimate to Gadban, who is primarily respon- slide lor all the disturbances m the neighbourhood of the Tigris, that'it would report being Basrah, and 700 soldiersnot be good policy for him to attack British steamers with a view to attracting attention to his grievances Bather than help him under such circumstances, the British Government would assist the Turkish Government in inflicting punishment on him for his misdeeds. In AugusHt was reported that the neighbourhood of the Port of Jeddah Disturbances at was in a very disturbed state and that the tribes were looting, whilst the greatest Jeddah ' excitement prevailed in the town. Consequently a request was made that arrangements should be undertaken for the despatch of a British man-of-war to the port, and that such visits should be made from time to time in the interests of the British traders and residents in the place. However, the British Ambassador at Constantinople expressed his opinion that such a visit would be resented by the Turkish Government. In September it was reported that Turkish troops were being despatched to Jeddah to protect it from attacks of the Bedouin, and on 10th September 100 infantry, one gun and about 20 mounted men arrived. During the year the following changes in the British ment in Turkey-in-Asia took place. Consular Establish- British Consular changes in,Turkey*iu- Asia. Mr. A. B. Geary relieved Mr. Crow at the end of April. During the absence of Colonel Ramsay from the 5 th March to the 19th Basrah.

Military. During the year under review there has been considerably less informa- Affa,rB in Yemen ‘ tion to hand regarding the progress of affairs in Yemen than in the previous twelve months. Discontent has been everywhere prevalent throughout the Yilayat, said to be caused by the gross mismanagement of public affairs by Ahmed Eezi Pasha, and the corrupt officials under him. As regards the political situation the mountainous districts have been fairly quiet, the inhabitants having been busy attending to their farms. In the Tebama, however, matters have been very different, and there have been incessant tribal feuds. Regarding the military situation, the total strength of the Turkish forces in the Yilayat at the end of April was reported to be between 27,000 and 30,000 men of all arms ; of these 5,000 were reported as being stationed in the Assyr Sandjak. On the 4th January it was reported that there had been renewed fighting with considerable casualties on both sides, and that a fresh Turkish advance was about to be made upon the Imam’s stronghold at Shahara. It was also said that the Imam was employing Turkish deserters from the Turkish army to train his troops. In May a report from Aden stated that the situation was going from had to worse, and that even the Sunni inhabitants of Taiz had taken up arms against the Turks. On the other hand, the British Vice-Consul at Hodaidah wrote from Sana’h, on 28th July, that the influence of the Imam was waning daily. He stated that there was a rumour that the latter was hard pressed by his rival the Dhiyani,* and had been obliged to retreat from his seat and take refuge in the impregnable fastness of Shahara. Tribesmen still continued to pour into the capital to announce their allegiance to the Sultan. * On the death o£ the original I mam in 1904, two candidates for the Imamship appeared, viz., Tahia'Haraid-al- Din, the son of the above mentioned Imam, and Said Muhammad-al-Hashim-al-Dhiyani, the latter being a man of about 60 years of age, and Chief of the tribe of Itajan or Dhiyan, which is located in the Sa’ada country. The tribes those Yahia as Imam who then marched against the Dhiyani and compelled him to relinquish his claims. In Sep- cember 1905 when the Turks retook Sana’h Said Muhammad rebelled agaiust the Imam, assisted covertly by the Turks and fighting has been going on practically ever since.96. On the 8 th August, the Political Resident at Aden slated that, according to a report received by him, the Imam intended to move against the Turks after the month of Ramzan. The Turks were also snid to be disarming the Arabs in the Yemen districts. A week later, the Political Resident intimated that the Turks were reported to be assisting the Dthahyani with arms and am- munition against the Imam. The latter was apparently desirous of settling matters with the Dthahyani, but they had declined to do so unless the Imam also came to terms with the Turks. They also threatened that, if he did not do so, they would join the Turks. Early in September it was reported from Perim that four Turkish steamers had arrived at Zaranik on the 14th August, each containing 400 troops, who were to operate against the Zaraniks. A newspaper report of the middle of October reports a general improve ment in the situation. The Imam Yahya and his Zaidias had not come to terms with the authorities, but their strength, it was said, had been greatly diminished by the action of the Shaikhs of Hashid, who, with their contingents, had made submission to the new regime. A report from the same source reported that Tahsin Pasha had been ap pointed Governor of Yemen, and commander of the garrison of that province. Communications. % A.— Maihcays, The Esgbdad Bait- Towards the end of December 1907, M. Isvolsky communicated certain views entertained by the Russian Government towards the construction of the Baghdad Railway. It was stated that great anxiety was felt in Russia as to the influence which the consequences of the building of the line w ould have on the actual situation in the Caucasus, Asia Minor, and Persia. It was parti cularly in the latter country, wliere a junction of the Baghdad Railway with the future Persian railways would imply an extension of German commercial interests and competition with existing trade, that alarm for the future was felt. It was added that although England and France had preserved their liberty of action, Russia had not the same position of absolute freedom, since, at the beginning of the recent Anglo-Russian negotiations, M. Isvolsky had given assurances to Germany that no action w r ould be taken which could in any°w T ay prejudice German interests, without previous discussion with the German Government. Notes had consequently been exchanged between Germany and Russia, with a view to obtaining from Germany guarantees against the ex tension of German influence in Persia, and to overcoming the opposition of Russia to the construction of the railway. From this exchange of notes there had been no results. The conclusion arrived at was that a new situation had been created, and that the question would have to be investigated in all its hearings. At the end of May, an Irode was issued by the Sultan of Turkey sanction ing the proposals of the Council of Ministers for the construction cf four new sections of the Baghdad Railway, and also sanctioning the raising of a loan to meet the cost. The loan of 220 million francs to be issued in instalments, and to be guaranteed by the surplus of the old revenues of the ceded debt, and by a surplus ot the tithes already assigned to the kilometric guarantee of the Anatolian Railway. The line to cross the Taurus range by the valley of the Tschakyd Tschai, instead of by the pass of the Cilician Gates. The work of construction on this section will be very difficult, but it will be lessened by utilising the railway from Meresina to Adana for the transport of materials. 1 rom Adana the line w ill run in an easterly direction across the Euphrates, and along the foot of the Anti-Taurus range to Helif, a small town which lies south of Mardiu. Branch lines wall be constructed to connect up with the large towns which lie off the route, and, no doubt, one of the first of these will be the linking up with Aleppo and the Aleppo-Damascus line, and so with the Hijaz Railway.At the end of June it was announced that the first detachment of engin eers had arrived in Constantinople from Germany on their way to survey the new sections of the railway. The construction of the railway has made no progress during the^ present year, and the terminus is, as it was at the end of 1906, still in the neighbour hood of BulgurSu. ^ During the year great progress was made on the railway, and tlm Hne wa y he Hliaz completed as far as Madinah. The work of construction was carried on smul- taneouslv from El Ula and Madinah, and on 1st September the inauguration ceremony took place at Madinah, a special Mission having been despatched from Constantinople for the purpose. This mission travelled by tram the whole way from Damascus to Madinah, a total distance of about 750 miles. Considerable opposition has been met with from the Arab tribes in the vicinity of Madinah. This was caused by the decision that the railway from Madinah to Makkah will follow the line via Babigh and Jeddah and the Bedouins saw their chances of gain from supplying ^ camel transport between the city and the coast seriously menaced. Several times they made attacks on the city of Madinah itself, and early in the year, they made a most determined attack on Kiazin Pasha, the Mushir in charge of the construction, m spite of the fact that he was escorted by more than a thousand cavalry. Little information has been received regarding the section sout ^ of ^ the line apparently traverses a more waterless and hrUy country tha t , but an easy trace has been found through a tributary of the W adi Humd. The reason for the decision to prolong the line from Madinah to^ Makkah via Rabi'di and Jeddah is due to the fact that this route is not only iree from serious eneineerinf difficulties, but also is well supplied with water ; whereas the eastern, or highland route, from Madinah to Makkah, also free from serious engineering difificultieSj lacks water* In August it was reported that the materials for the Madinah-Rabigh ° i • i priori thp latter nlace, and that the Sultan had issued section were being landed at tlie iatxer piace, «* nil- orders for the construction of the section as far as 'rim season The Political Resident at Aden also reported that all sories for the J eddah-—Makkah section had arrived in the latter poit y . beginning of August. .

ADEN AND HINTEEXAND. There have been no serious disturbances in the Aden Hinterland during the year under review, though the usual petty troubles between the various tribes have been more or less frequent. Attacks on caravans In January it was reported that the Juledi Shaikh had formed a combina- Jurabi'countf! and tion with some of the Jurabi clans to loot kafilas and disturb the roads generally in their neighbourhood. They commenced operations by attacking a Kat caravan, and the owners complained rather bitterly of our apparent indifference to disorders in the Subehi country. The aggression was directed mainly against the Hummaida tribe, the members of which escort caravans from Turkish territory to Aden. Tim Hummaida seemed to have had somewhat the better of the fight, and, in the middle of Eebruary, it was announced that a three months’ truce had been concluded. The actual hindrance to trade was not serious, the importance of the affair lying rather in the fact that the Hummaida are a Turkish tribe, and thereby difficulties might arise, righting between In January sharp fighting was reported on the Habiler between the Kotaibi Alawi Shaikhs. and an ^ Alawi Shaikhs. Two sons of the Kotaibi Shaikh were killed, and the Alawi Shaikh was compelled to fly to Lahej. The Abdali Sultan sent his brother to settle matters; and this the latter accomplished successfully, placing temporary garrisons in the Alawi strongholds that had been captured by the Kotaibi. In [February the Kotaibi and Alawi Shaikhs came into Aden and were interviewed in the presence of the Abdali Sultan. All agreed that the Alawi Shaikh having been the aggressor should not be admitted to a position of responsibility on the road, and that his transport dues and stipend should pass to the Kotaibi. In May a year’s truce was finally agreed to between the two Shaikhs. Quarrel between At the end of March it was reported that some of the Markashi tribe had F h adthir arkaahl aud murdered two petty Yafai Sultans while on their way to pay the Eadthli Sultan a visit. When the Eadthli demanded the surrender of the murderers the whole section to which they belonged fled to the Aulaki country. The Mrakashi relations, and professed their willingness to surrender the murderers if the instigators were punished. In April, as the Markashis had not given any satisfaction, the Eadthli Sultan was said to have formed the intention of entering on reprisals against them. However, in June it was reported that the Upper Yafai were collecting in large numbers to attack the Eadthli. The latter asked Government to help with troops and money, but the answer given was that the Sultan had brought the trouble on himself by his failure to punish the murderers, and that therefore Government could not intervene in the matter. In August, the [Resident reported that the Abdali Sultan, fearing fighting on a ’arge scale between the two tribes, was trying to effect a settlement, but that he could not hope for success without the moral support of the Government. Upon this the Resident was authorised to attempt a settlement on the understanding that Government were not to be committed in any way. Accordingly a meeting was arranged between the two parties, and the following agreement was finally entered upon :— {a) The Eadthli to pay down at once 2,000 dollars as compensation for the murders. (S) Until the Yafai should succeed in avenging themselves by killing the murderers, or until the Eadthli Sultan should execute or hand over the murderers to the Yafai, 200 dollars to be paid annually to the tribe to which the murdered men belonged. (c) Tne tax of one dollar a head on Yafais passing through the Eadthli country to be discontinued. The matter has been closed and the settlement received the approval of the Secretary of State. hinted that the murder was committed at the instigation of the Fadthli’s own F urther trouble V\ n f Tic nc r» 4-P r* T In May the Resident reported that trouble had again broken out between .1 nr»a hi nrrrl • i j i ° . _ .concerned were invited to come to Aden to settle the matter, but they refused unless all their demands were acceded to. It was found that the Subehi had deliberately broken the truce, murdering a Hummaida Shaikh. Up to the end of the year frequent complaints were made regarding the unruly behaviour of the Subehis, who were constantly committing outrages unchecked. In August a complaint was received from the Shaikhs of Eubeaten and Sha’ ib e J c J rk t r f b ^ 0 em f p r om that they had been summoned by the Turkish Qaim-Maqam of Eada with a view Unbeaten, to extracting tribute. They forwarded three letters in which the Turks distinctly stated that Eubeaten was part of Turkish territory. The Shaikhs were told to inform the Turks that Eubeaten was not Turkish territory. Up to the present there have been no further developments. In April it was reported that the Benadir Government required 1,000 As ka r 7 8 ul in e Aaen by Askaris, and that the Italian Consul at Aden was making good progress in their the Italian Govem- enrolment. At the request of the Italian Government permission was granted menu to the Italian cruiser to assist the Consul by transporting the men across to Benadir. At the request of employers of labour in Aden, recruiting has been limited to the protected states beyond British limits. On the 15th April Colonel Lysaght took over the duties of Political personal. Eesident from Major-General De Brath, who on return from leave resumed his duties on the 27th July. In March Mr. Bury, late Extra Assistant-Eesident at Aden, applied for permission to travel through Arabia, and to explore the southern edge of the Great Eed Desert of Southern Arabia on behalf of the Eoyal Geographical Society. He proposed to land at Masqat, follow the Oman-Makkah road as far as Longitude 55 degrees, and then strike south-west, as nearly as routes and wells would permit, coming out at one of the ports on the Gulf of Aden. The request was, however, refused. BAHEAIN. In the middle of March it was reported that the Deputy-Governor of Lingeh, raini subject by the who is in the hands of the Eussian and Turkish self-styled agents, had flogged ^ overuor and imprisoned a Bahrain subject, entirely refusing to accept the intervention of the British Agent on behalf of Bahrainis. Early in April the British Ee- presentative in Tehran was informed that instructions had been issued by the Persian Government to the local Eingeh authorities to make suitable reparation. However, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’ Affaires was of opinion that it might be necessary to threaten to occupy a Persian port or an island before the Persian Government were brought to realise the gravity of the case. ^ During May re peated representations were made by Mr. Marling to the Persian Government, but he did not succeed in obtaining a recognition of the right of Great Britain to protect Bahraini subjects. He was, moreover, of opinion that, unless material pressure could be brought to bear on the Persian Government, such recog nition would not be obtained. In July further reports of harsh treatment by the Persian authorities were received, but no satisfaction was obtainable from the Persian Govern ment. AL QATIF. Further developments of this incident, which was noticed in the annual Summarv for last year, are as follows. On 21 st January, Sir E. Grey reported that, as the result of representations made to the Porte in August 1907, the 'Vali of Basrah, while expressing keen regret for what had happened, stated that there was no Qaim-Maqam at Qatif at the time of the incident, the post being in charge of a certain Avni Effendi who had been since removed. Apparently the Captain of the port was chiefly to blame, and he been suspended for three months. Instructions, however, had been sent to the present Qaim-Maqam directing him to make an apology to an officer of any of His Majesty’s ships which might call at Qatif. In consideration of this H. M. o. “ Lapwing” proceeded to Qatif at the beginning of June, and it was reported that the Qaim-Maqam came on board and presented an apology in writing whilst also making a verbal apology.

AL HASA. Towards the close of the year it was reported that affairs m Hasa were very unsettled. The Turks were apparently unable to maintain order, with the result that the Ojair-Hasa caravan route became infested by the Rani ilajir tribe. As the Turkish authorities seemed incapable of affording protection to the people, these turned to Bin Mashuk, an Agent of Bin Saud, for assistance, which was promised. Later accounts, however, state that at his instigation even the towns-people of Hasa had begun to plunder each other, the local authorities being powerless to control them ; and it was believed he was encourag*^ ing the Katar tribes to harass the Hasa-Ojair road. In December the Turkish authorities appear to have at length taken steps to restore order; and between the middle and end of the month despatche some 4 steamers conveying about 1,000 infantry and IcO mules to A1 Hasa. KUWAIT. British relations with the Shaikh. During the course of the year under review the Political Agent at Kuwait has had much difficulty with Shaikh Mubarak over a number of apparently trivial matters. However, towards the close of the year it was reported that the Shaikh was disposed to be very friendly with the Agent and the Naval officers of the boats in the Gulf wdio happened to visit him. m During the year it was frequently stated that the friendship between of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammareh continued to increase and the former made several trips in his launch to visit the latter. In spite of the warning given to the Shaikh by the British Political Agent, as reported in last year’s Summary, not to meddle in the affairs or Najd, he continued to do so. In February it was reported that the Shaikhhad intervened in a treacherous, hut successful manner, between the bin Rashid and bin Saud factions Apparently he detached the Umtair tribe from the former, and generally lulled their suspicions by false assurances of benevolent intervention, whilst at the same time he informed bin Saud that it was a good time to attack his enemies. Apparently Mubarak’s object was to show bin Saud that he was not strong enough to stand alone, and when he saw that bin Saud had learnt his lesson, he shamelessly deceived the bin Rashid party, and delivered them over into the hands of bin Saud. About the middle of January the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Dispute with the reported that the Shaikh of Kuwait had complained that the Turks were causing him less by obstructing the repair of his bunds at Pao. Also that the shaikh’s property they had demanded that he should leave a space of 600 metres clear on the at Fao ' north and south sides of the fort at that place. On the matter being referred to the Yali of Basrah, the reply was given that Shaikh Mubarak was reclaim ing new ground and not only repairing old bunds as represented by him. On 1st Pebruary the Shaikh again complained that the Turks had destroyed his bunds and let in the water, thereby destroying many date trees. Prom reports received in March it seemed that the two parties had come to an understanding. In April, however, it was found that the Shaikh was much aggrieved still, and begged that pressure might be brought to bear on the Turks^ to induce them to agree to the formation of a committee to examine the position on the spot by thelight of the Shaikh’s documents. In view of this tbe Secretary of State asked for a report on the subject, and Major Knox visited Basrah and Pao to collect information. As a result he reported that he considered the Turks to have good reason for destroying the Shaikh’s dams. At the same time Major Knox expressed an opinion that the failure of the British Gov ernment to give the Shaikh the active assistance and support, which he had looked for in the present difficulty, was prejudicing his action in other impor tant questions such as that of quarantine. The Political Resident m the Persian Gulf was therefore supported by tbe Government of India in the hope that it might be considered expedient to endeavour to induce the Porte to agree to the appointment of a committee. Owing to a misunderstanding on the part of the Political Agent, Kuwait Bights of the Kuwait over the islands of of the Bandar Shwaikh foreshore agreement had included an additional clause givina a ri&gt;ht of pre-emption to the entire island of Warba, situated near the Eub.,.a and w»,b. 0 .. . -1 -i.. Arivclinnel \7 flip Political JChor Abdullah, audits surrounding foreshore. Accordingly the _ Political Auent was instructed to ascertain the nature of the Shaikh s claims to the island. In the middle of September a detailed report was furnished concern ing both tbe island of Warba and that of Bubiyan. The evidence concerning Warba Island is by no means conclusive. The Shaikh claims that the island, which has never been occupied, belongs to him on geographical considerations, as being the proprietor under a deed ot settle ment of the opposite coast line from Pao to Khor Zubair. As regards Bubiyan it appears that until the establishment there of a post by tbe Turkish authorities the island had been in the exclusive possession of the Awazine tribe, who had exercised for generations fishing rights in virtue of grants made by the Shaikhs of Kuwait. At the end of July a quarrel took place on board a Br ^ fl J“ di \ n Co “' kS? panv’s vessel at Kuwait between Kuwait and lersian subjects. 1 6 8 i ans 0 n a British absence of Shaikh Mubarak, the Political Agent represented the matter to India Co m P a n y Shaikh Jabir, bis son, who punished tbe offenders.^ Shaikh MubaraA on bis return took exception to the Political Agent’s action in interfering in he dispute, and intimated to the British India Company that their vessels were not required at Kuwait. At the end of August Major Knox reported that tbe Shaikh was veering round, and was in readiness to come to an understand ing if tbe senior representative of the Company went to interview him. Ibis interview took place and the Shaixh was very affable in his behaviour. n this the incident was considered to be closed. On 25th October it was reported that the Shaikh had removed the pro hibition against passengers travelling by, and goods being shippe y 3 e British India Company’s vessels.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000912.0x00008a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/212</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000912.0x00008a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/212</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Summary of Principal Events. 1908'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1909/1909</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-06-06T22:04:12</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (74 folios)</extent><extent>The file contains a table of contents at the front of the volume (f 5).</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 76; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.Pagination: the file also contains an original printed pagination sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file consists of one volume containing a summary of principal events in 1908 by Wilfrid Malleson, Assistant Quartermaster-General, Intelligence Branch, Division of the Chief of Staff, Simla.It covers the following: Russia in Asia, Northern China, Bhutan, Burma, China, Indo-China, Japan, Korea, Malay Peninsula, Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands Indies, Siam, Sikkim, Tibet, Eastern Bengal and Assam, Persia, Turkey in Asia, Arabia, Somaliland, Abyssinia, Afghanistan, North-West Frontier, Baluchistan, and unrest in India.Topics include: politics - foreign and internal relations, military, communications, commercial, climate and health, resources, harbours, shipping, telegraphs, naval matters, and geography.Also includes one map on folio 28: 'SKETCH MAP SHOWING THE PROGRESS OF RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION IN CHINA IN 1908'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Annual reports</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Deputy Quartermaster-General, Intelligence Branch</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000912.0x00008a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
