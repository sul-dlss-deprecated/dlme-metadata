Preserved here are parts of two shrines, each with a standing image of Ramesses II surmounted by a sun disk and protective cobras. The female figure in the left shrine is Anat-of-Ramesses-Beloved-of-Amun, a form of the Near Eastern goddess Anat that was worshiped in Egypt and may here be a manifestation of a divine aspect of Ramesses. Although this relief may come from a temple, it somewhat resembles blocks from a private tomb at Saqqara showing seated pair statues of Ramesses with a deity in a similar combination of raised and sunk relief. The tomb scene may commemorate one of the <i>Sed</i>-festivals of royal renewal that Ramesses began celebrating in his thirtieth year as pharaoh. Even if carved that late in Ramesses's reign, the figures here are stylistically similar to some images of his earlier year as king. </p>", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-08-01", "date_added": "2008-09-26 00:00:00", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 7127958, "name": "Saqqara, Egypt", "type": "Possible place collected"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.54.67_wwg8.jpg", "id": 75406, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.54.67_wwg8.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.54.67_wwg8.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 54}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 108}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 217}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 435}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 871}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.54.67_wwg8.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "West Wing gallery 8 installation", "caption": " <em>Representation of Pair Statues of King Ramesses II</em>, ca. 1279-1213 B.C.E.
