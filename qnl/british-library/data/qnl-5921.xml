Forbidding of Kuwait Nationals to purchase property in Iraq. Sir, His Excellency the Shaikh has reported to me that he has heard a rumour that the ’Iraq Government have recently passed a law to the effect that in future no Kuwait subject would be peimitted to purchase property in or around Basra. 2. The above story has also been confirmed by Mr.Chisholm of the A.P.O.C., who happened to arrive in Kuwait from Basra, last night (10.10.33), and also by the Shaikh’s Basra lawyer who was here last Monday (9.10.33). 3. His Excellency the Shaikh protested that such a law, if it was correct that it had been passed, was a grave discrimination against Kuwait state, and appeared to be directed against himself because of his well known friendship with His Majesty’s Government. 4 . I should be grateful if enquiry could be made from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad if there is any truth in the report, and if correct, whether the exact wording of the new law could kindly be supplied to me for His Excellency the Shaikh’s information. 5.

As we consider Kuwait and Iraq as one country(home) especially in the economical affairs, I therefore request you to Kindly communicate with the Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, vhether it is possible for him to ask the Iraq Government to a^ree to the registration of the properties belonging to the Kuwait subjects in their names.
