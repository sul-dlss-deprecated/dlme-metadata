Cemp B£hrain,the 13th November 1933 /-V % To, The Honourable the Political nesicient in the Persian Gulf. Subject:- VM MiMLISu &amp;m, ANfe Memorandu m. 1 have been reflecting for some time past on the desirability of establisuing a light house at or in the vicinity of has al h&amp;dc^situ&amp;tee at the extreme eastern point of the Arabian Peninsula ana at the southern entrance to the Gulf of Oman. 2. Though as a la/man in such matters i crave indulgence for putting forward the proposal,the establish ment of a light house in this neighbourhood would seem to be fully justifiable both in view of past events and future envelopments. 3. .'hi 1st the coastline in this inhospitable area is rochy ana dangerous,! uncerstana from tuose better qualified to speaic that at most seasons of the year there exists a veiy strong set from east to west all dong this littoral,which is necessarily skirted by all shipping plying between Basrah and Aden or vice versa. 4. whilst I am unaware of what lights exist within the sphere of the Aden Protectorate,there is no other light m Muscat territory south of that situated at the entrance to Muscat harbour. t&gt;. Numberless wrecks ana exciting incidents have occurred in the past between Pur and K&amp;s al Hadd and only as recently as April last a French tanker ran on to the rocks in thisin this vicinityjnarrowl/ averting a catastrophic disaster in consequence* 6 . The early opening up of an aerial route linking up h&amp;srah and Aden along this coastline furnishes further grounds for the present suggestion* * asirah Island and :hor J&amp;rama^oth refuelling points for the Royal Air Force Plying Boats,are within comparatively close distance of Has al Haud,whilst an aeroplane landing grouna actually exists in proximity to the site of tne suggested light* The establishment of a guiding beacon here should,therefore, prove of iimecse value to belated aircraft in case of emergency. V* hilst xt does not lie within the scope of this memorandum to suggest the type of light,it seems desirable to point out that any form of light would have to be effectively protected from the possible attentions of the wild ana superstitious inhabitants of this region.
