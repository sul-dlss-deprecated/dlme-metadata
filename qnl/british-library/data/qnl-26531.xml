My dear Christopher, Your Confidential letter E 7961/31/25 of January 4 about ad-Dabbagh and Sadiq.:- You will see by our printed despatch No. 18 of January 24 that I limited my written communication to Puad to a bare statement that these two sportsmen had been required to leave India and that I understood them to have left. I did the rest in conversation with Puad on January 24. I said that the worst of our action against these people was that they had to go somewhere and that the likeliest places were Eritrea and ’Iraq, vtfith the former I was not concerned but he must not be surprised if they were next heard of in ’Iraq. Indeed, I said, I thought they had actually gone there and we could not prevent it. Puad took what I said quite calmly and thanked me. I think the view of the Sa’udi G-overnment (and I personally rather agree with it, though Calvert formed a different opinion) is that these people are especially dangerous in India, where they can foment the hatred of many Indian Moslems towards Ibn Sa’ud and can consort with people like Shauqat ’Ali, whom Ibn Sa’ud wholeheartedly abhors and perhaps fears more than a little. I mentioned to Puad that I believed Sddiq to be an Iraqi C.F.A. Warner, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W. 1.Iraqi national* He said he might well have “been given that status, I laughed and reminded him of a private confession he had made to me in Jerusalem that he himself had three nationalities, Sa’udi, Syrian and Palestinian.

A copy of this letter is being sent by Air Mail to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. A G. LAITHWAITEI In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. E 5729/31/25 and address— not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 7 X 18th October, 1953 Sir, With reference to Mr. Laithwaite f s letter am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda regarding the anti-Saudi activities of Tahir ad Dabbagh and a certain Muhammad Sadiq, who is also reported to be in India. 2. In view of the request made by the Saudi Arabian Government, Sir John Simon will be grateful if the Government of India may be urged to order the departure of these two men from India. Neither of them should be allowed to go to any part of the British Empire. 3. In the case of Tahir ad Dabbagh, whose United Kingdom passport has been taken from him, it will presumably be necessary to supply an affidavit in the customary form for use in lieu of a passport: a, copy of this form is enclosed for reference; ix can of course be amended to suit the circumstances of the particular case. The only difficulty connected with its use is that occasionally the authorities of the country from which a visa is being sought on such a document refuse to grant one unless a reentry 0OPY SENT BY AiR MAIL visa The Under Secretary of State, ftf ^ India Office.

There seems, however, no reason to suppose that all the states to wnich Dabbagh might wish to travel would adopt this view. 4. The question of Dabbagh’s further movements then arises. As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, Dabbagh is now forbidden access to Egypt, Palestine, Transjordan and Aden. Presumably, therefore, he will be unable to obtain visas for these territories when he seeks to leave India. It also seems undesirable that he snould find his way to any of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Sir John Simon would suggest that the Government of India should take any steps which they may consider necessary to avert this possibility. Meanwhile, a circular will be addressed to His Majesty’s Consular and Passport Control Officers, instructing them not to grant him a visa for those States. 5. Sir John Simon does not consider that Dabbagh should be deported to his country of origin, Saudi Arabia, since, in view of the attitude of the Saudi authorities towards him, it would be tantamount to delivering a political offender to certain imprisonment or execution. But if Dabbagh should decline to leave India, it might perhaps be explained to him that in the event of his not doing so of his own accord he would leave the Government of India no * ^ alternative but to deport him. 6. Sir John Simon would be grateful if the Government of India might be requested to report by telegraph Dabbagh 1 s eventual destination. 7.7# Copies of this letter are being sent to the Colonial Office and to His Majesty’s Representatives at Cairo, Bagdad and Jedda.

P*- Would you kindly refer to the correspondence ending with the Government of India's telegram of 8th July, No.1628, about the impounding of the passport of Tahir-al- Dabbagh? By last week's air mail we sent you copy of a d.o. letter from the Foreign Office, dated 18th July, setting out their views as to Tahir’s future. The Secretary of State recognises the force of the Foreign Office arguments for immobilising Dabbagh if possible in some place where his anti-Saudi activities would be comparatively innocuous and where he would not be in direct touch with Saudi Arabia, etc. On the other hand, he woula be very reluctant that Dabbagh should in any way become a source of embarrassment to the Government of India. We do not at the moment know what his financial position is, or the reasons for his visit to India. Subject, however, to the Government of India's views, we are disposed to think that if he is in fact in no financial difficulties and can support himself, and so long as he does not indulge in any 1712a 5000 3.3:i political/political activities which may he obnoxious, it would, as the Foreign Office suggest, he best to leave matters as they are, merely keeping a close watch on his activities. 2. We should he grateful if the Government of India could, if possible, let us have Information on the point raised in para .3 of the Foreign Office letter of 18th Yours sincerely. (Sd.) J. C.

Our main idea in taking steps to secure Dahhagh^ passport was to immobilize him, if possible, in some place where his anti-Saudi activities would be comparatively innocuous and to keep him away from Eritrea, Iraq or other countries where we should have no means of checking such activities and where proximity to Saudi Arabia would make them really dangerous. The Hadramaut would not be good from this point of view. We consider, therefore, that, since he has now been traced and his passport impounded in India, it would be far best that he should, if possi^,'there at any rate for the J.G. Laithwaite, Esq.

It in proposed by the Foreign Office to instruct British Consular and Passport authorities to impound as soon as opportunity offers British passport No.5012 granted to Tahir al Dabbagh in July 1926 which is referred to in the letter from the Consul-General of December 20th enclosed with Cairo despatch under reference.

From Consul-General 1 s letter of the 20th December it appears that Tahir may be in possession of passport granted to him by Sultan of Shehr and Me kail a on February 13th, 1926. As he appears to be an Hejasx his claim to be a subject of the above- mentioned Sultan should be investigated* and if circumstances warrant it, ai-eps should be taken to deprive him of that passport also* and to prevent him from obtaining another on the strength of that claim*THiS RESXD^CY, CAIRO.

Hia Tajenty was most indignant at this impudent attempt to associate him with a crew of conspirators* A previous attempt had been made to incriminate him in the Ibn Rifada revolt. He had no sympathy with such people and refused to be involved. His Majesty added that he had turned the matter over to his T) rime Minister who would speak to me on the subject, the 3 rime Minister spoke to me subsequently of this appeal and was good enough to communi cate to me, with His Majesty’s approval, a copy of its text. A summary translatioxi is transmitted herewith# Sidky as ha said that the Egyptian Government likewise refused to be involved in such matters, and that he contemplated the expul- sion of both the writer and the transmitter of the letter. They would not tolerate the use of Hgypt as a locus o j intrigue against the King of the Hedjae for although ^gypt had not yet recognised Ihn Jaud, they intended to aot aa a periectly correct neighbour. 2. The document is signed by Mohammed Taher Al-Dabbdgh, a former Minister of Finance in the Hejas, who is doubtless the individual referred to under Ho.

The document was submitted to King Fuad by Lmir daid til Gesairi who is visiting Lgypt from Damascus. The Hejasi National Tact attached to the petition to His Majesty is presumably that referred to in paragraph 19 of Sir A* Hyan's Secret memorandum (£ 4737/76/25) of aept^nber last. It will be observed that this Tact is dated January 1928. 3. I enclose also copies of a letter from the Fubllo Security Intelligence Department, Khartoum, from which it will be seen that 3ayed Ali ^1 Mirghani has received a similar request for sympathy and support. 4. iiimir 3aid dl Gesairl is being requested by the Egyptian Government to leave Lgypt as a result of his inter vention in this affair. 5. It is perhaps not irrelevant to record in this con text that a certain Sayed kohammed Taher Masoud Al-Babbagh, bearing a British passport issued in Cairo in July 1926, arrived at Hues from Maasawa on December 12th. He was able to convince the passport authorities that he was not identical with, but was the brother of the individual referred to in paragraph 2 above; and he was therefore allowed to proceed to Cairo for a weei^s visit to Sayed Abdul Lalek-Al-Khatib, before continuing his journey to Jerusalem. He was instructed by the Director-General of the European Department, on arrival In Cairo, to abstain from any subversive activity while in £gypt on pain of instant expulsion. He left for Jerusalem on December 13th after one day's stay in Cairo. 6. I enclose a letter from Hr. Consul-General Eabino, giving details of this man’s application for a British passport auuii—ui6.

Circular (Mo. 1 2117/593/378) of March 10th last) prescribes a limitation of travel facilities to be accorded by His Majesty's Consular Officer to Hadramie, that his British pass port should be withdrawn.

The standard of Mohammed Ali and Ibrahim has been handed to the greatest of their descendants... Your/Your Majesty, Among the greatest deeds of history, never to be forgot** ten by Moslems, was the deliverance of the Two holy Places from the hand of the rebel Afahabis and rude heretics by Your Majesty's ancestor, the paladin of Islam, Mohammed All, eto. Your Majesty, History repeats itself. For nine years Islam has suffered the catastrophe of the return of the tyrants' sons to the deeds of their forebears.•••♦ ie can never forget the false lie of that intriguer of Islam the greatest enemy of Moslems in general and of the noble family of Mohammed Ali in particular, that enemy of religion, ihilby, who intrigues against Islam in the guise of &amp; Moslem. For he said in effect that the vahabls, having entered the Hejaz, would not find one like Mohammed All to turn them out. It has escaped this ignorant fool that the banner of Mohammed Ali is still flying, and that his sword is still unsheathed. Your Majesty, The Hejaz and the whole of Islam deeply thank Your Majesty for your attitude towards this heresy and for Your Majesty's non-recognition of this brutal government, eto. Your Majesty, Our Party labours to deliver the Two Holy Places from the heretic*, drawing inspiration from Your Majesty's sympathy and satisfaction with its noble purpose. Phis Party has well organised its plans to reach its lofty aim. Your servant is honoured today to be the bearer of the present tidings which is that the time has oome for the party to execute its plan. ‘The party has declared a iiejaz revolution in the land of Asir on the blessed Friday the 5th of Hajab.

IVora it Tour Majesty will discern the high aims of that revolu tionary body. Tour Majesty, This revolutionary body draws courage and power from the souls of Mohamad All and Ibrahiia to complete their project and follow their steps. Those two spirits, hovering over the revolutionaries and encouraging them to press on in the way of God and for the sake of the Holy laces, inspire them with the thought 'Fuad is our khalifa, the inheritor of our glory, the 're&amp;liser of our project. Raise to him your voice. He will 'respond to you in our name..... he will be to you what we were 'to your fathers'’..... Your Majesty, The revolution has won undreamt-of success in a few daya ...

Your Majesty, Military prudence commends expedition to the revolution ary body. Its adversary should not be given time in which to assemble his forces* After the first act has been accom plished the preparation for further acts are in the hands of Your Majesty. Your Majesty, You hold the highest position in Islam in the universe... The continuance of the rebel government of the Holy Ilacea and of its pollution of those pure abodes with their unorthodoxy is the greatest shame befallen Islam in this epoch.*•• cour ancestor has shown tjs how to act against such, there being no remedy but the sword on their neck and fire in their house,.A nation exists which will realise the desires of those two spirits (of your ancestors) for they have rowed to God to reach their goal or die in the attempt...* Your Majesty, Everything is in the hands of Your Majesty. The revolu tionary body Is honoured to plaoe its leadership in your hands, to advance with it to victory and eternal fame. The Hejaz which has been steeped in the ocean of your ancestor's magnanimity only expects salvation from Your Majesty.... Ash assistance of God, o Ming, and bestow upon these holy warriors your patronage, consideration and assistance, for this is the greatest of all works which God has bestowed upon you...

Sir, I have read with great interest Sir Percy loraine's Secret despatch to you No.ll21(429/350/33) of December 24, of which he w&amp;a good enough to send me a copy* It is interesting to compare the text of the •’Hejaai National paet rt sent to King Fuad with that which I had in mind when I compiled last September the memorandum to which Sir Percy Lorain© refers. I enclose for convenience of reference a copy of the r-aper on which I was then relying. It will be seen that Hussein ad-Dabbagh sent the Pact to ShauQat All on January 16, 1928, eleven days after the date attached to the version sent to King Fuad* 2. In these circumstances, it would be raaeonabl© to expect the two texts to represent the same original. &amp;any of the discrepancies are in fact such as may be accounted for by the vageries of unknown translators but I am struck by the presence in the Egyptian version of Article 1 of the words ’’in its natural boundaries obtained by the Arab revolution’ and still more by the difference between the two translations of Article 3. It is }uet possible that these are also due to looseners in translation, but the express use of the words ’monarchioar* and ’’republican 1 ’ in the version now enclosed was one of the features that impressed me most, as corresponding to an ideal far more advanced than that expressed in the other* 3. I draw your attention to this point only because of its bearing The Sight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.d.X*, K.C*V.O*, etc., etc., etc.bearing on the question of the relatione between the Hiab al Ahrar al and the exponents of Hashimlte pretensions to the Eejazl throne.

I need cot trouble you with further observations on Sir Percy loraine’s despatch except to say that in my opinion the man mentioned in paragraph 5 as having &gt;a^sed through Igypt on December 12 and IS could oniy have be^n the T&amp;hir ad-DabbSph, who has figured so largely in reports on the &lt;f ad-iPibbSgh plot' and who met the Amirs Tulal and ihEicir at Jerusalem - apparently within the following few days, although 1 have not yet got the precise date of the meeting* ?£hlr aa-D&amp;bb&amp;*h is a Bejaai by origin and I should be glad to see him deprived of his British mssport on any plausible ground. bm I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Hi» Majesty*a Ambassador at Bagdad, His Maj©sty , s High Commissioners at ^airo and Jerusalem and His Maj©ety*s Chief Commissioner at Aden.

Sir, I have the honour to etute that on June 26 the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs s joke to me about the activities of one Hussein ad-habbagh, a person of Moorish origin born in the He jaii, who 1 a o. lei t this country for Lahe^J and vas now in t o habit oi frequenting d.n, ti e Ye ion and aseowah. S hey kh Ydeui Y?»eXn stated, that t is wan was engaged in propaganda against the present regime in the Hejas md was believed to have subversive matter printed in /den for circulation in the ie ion and elsewhere. He had also eent agents to the Hejez, e &gt; •© of vhorn had bt;en arrested. Ho was suppose to be working in the Hashiuiite interest and was asoociatadi with another person having similar connections na ed Subhi al Halabi. Sheykl; yfisuf did not suggest that this last named individual had any thing to do with den. He invoked article 2 of tie Treaty of Jedda in connection with the alleged activities of ad-nabbagh. 7 l°ld 'heykh Ytlsuf Y^stn that Fie Majesty* w ’ovemfr-ent lied never regarded and could not regard Article 2 of th ? Trerty of Jedda as entailing an obligation to prevent the publication of politico! literature disagreeable to the respective parties* I admitted that such publication might be undesirable and undertook to refer his complaint to you, not as a matter arising under the Treaty, but as one with which the Government of /den might olitical } esident13$ might find it poesible to deal on general principles of friend liness and in accordance with the desire of Hie ysjesty’s Oovernnent to discourage anything dangerous to peace and stability ir Arabia. 3* X snould be glad to know whet further reply you would wish me to make to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. I may explain that in giving Sheykh ytUmf y&amp;sln a cautiously favourable hearing, except as regards the applicability of Article 2 of the Treaty of redda, I was influenced by the wish of His ; e,.esty’s Government to collaborate with jbn r.a’&amp;d in coping with the situation resulxing from the incursion into the Northern Hejaz of a prrty of rebels, who passed through Trans jordan and who are believed by the Hejazi Government to have been egged on by members of the Hashiraite family. 4* hhaykh Ytiauf Y^eln promised to let me have samples of the ..rinted matter cii ciliated by ad.-r&lt;abbagh. if he produces them, I will forward them to you in due course.

It documents their movements in political exile and their eventual return to Saudi Arabia, following the Saudi Government's granting of a general amnesty to political émigrés in January 1935.Much of the file's correspondence, which largely consists of copies of letters received by the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office, is concerned with the movements of Mohamed Tahir al Dabbagh and another Saudi political exile, Muhammad Abdulla Ahmed Sadiq [Muḥammad ʿAbdullāh Ahmed Sadiq], during 1933-1934. It reports on the pair's visit to (and subsequent expulsion from) India, and discusses whether the Government of India has powers to prevent the two men from entering foreign countries such as Iraq or Eritrea.Other notable anti-Saudi figures discussed in the correspondence include Abdul Raouf Sabban [‘Abd al-Ra‘uf al-Sabban], Abdul Hamid al Khatib [‘Abd al-Ḥamīd al-Khaṭīb, former envoy of Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī], and Mohamed Tahir al Dabbagh's brother, Husain [Ḥusayn Ṭāhir al-Dabbagh].The file features the following principal correspondents: His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires to Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert); His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); the Political Resident, and later, Chief Commissioner, Aden (Bernard Rawdon Reilly); the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Philip Cunliffe-Lister); the High Commissioner, Cairo (Percy Loraine, succeeded by Miles Wedderburn Lampson); Sayed Mohamed Tahir al Dabbagh; the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs [Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd]; officials of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
