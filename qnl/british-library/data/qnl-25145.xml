Protest against the extension/ of Italian hostilities to the very mouth of the Dardanelles in spite of the assurances of the Powers to limit military operations to Tripoli and respectfully point out, as British subjects to fee His Majesty’s Government the deplorable consequences of destroying faith in the words of the great Powers, including England, by flagrant breach of promises.INDIAN MOSLEM A ^PREHENSIONS. The Committee of the London All-India Moslem League have addressed to the Foreign Office a representation on “ the extreme gravity of the situation the latest development of Italian activity in the Dardanelles and the ASgean Sea is creating in the East.' They have reason to fear that the direct and immediate result of_ the situation will be to imperil large bodies of Musulmans from India as well as the frontier to endeavour to reach the seat of war as volunteers, and it would be impossible for his Majesty’s Government to repress the move ment without risk of great unpopularity. Attention is called to the extreme incon venience to Musulman pilgrims and the loss to Indian commerce occasioned by the Italian blockade of the Red Sea ports. The Committee have been requested by many of their Indian co-religionists to submit that the injury caused by the Italian action has been far greater than is usually imagined. Large bodies'of pilgrims have been unable to leave Hefijaz for fear of capture by the Italian ships of war, and the suffering and distress among them is very great. The Committee pray his Majesty s Government “ to take such steps as they may consider expedient to prevent the further development of a situation which they really fear will prove most prejudicial to the interests of humanity and to progress in the Eastern World.”■ The Secretary of State for India has caused the following letter lo be addressed to the London All-India Moslem League in reply to a representation received from them on the subject of the Italo-Turkish War:— “India Office, “ Sir, 23rd May 1912. “ I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to aclmowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant on the subject of the Italo- Turkish War, and in reply to say that he fully appreciates the motives that have animated your League in making their representation, but that he cannot enter upon a particular discussion of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment, or of that of the other Governments concerned in the matters at issue. “ The outbreak of hostilities between two Powers with which this country is united by ties of longstanding and valued friendship was regretted by none more than by His Majesty’s Government. But while they have not failed in all cases brought to their notice to protect the rights of all British subjects, and while they are anxious by all means in their power to secure respect for the religious susceptibilities of the Indian Moslem community, His Majesty’s Government must emphatically repeat the disclaimer already given in my letter to you of the 19th March of any intention to offer advice to either of the belligerents regarding the sphere or conduct of their military operations. “ They believe that this attitude will commend itself to the good sense of Indian Moslems, who, they are confident, will continue on their own part, to observe that strict neutrality which is required of all subjects of His Majesty without distinction. “ A copy of this letier is being communicated to the Press.” I have, &amp;c., The Honorary Secret.. ry Lionel Abrahams.

Sir:- The Corrmittee of the London All-India Moslem League beg respectfully and earnestly to draw the attention of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for Foreign 5 Affairs to the extreme gravity of the situation the latest development of Italian activity in the Dardanelles and the Aegean Sea is creating in the East. The Committee submit that failure to conquer Libya, with which object the enterprise, condemned by the unanimous moral conscience of Europe, was undertaken, furnishes no justification for endeavouring to set in flame the whole of the Eastern World, to create an irreconcilable hostility between two great religions and to involve neutral Powers ruling over large Mussul man populations in difficulties by placing their policy in conflict with the cherished sentiments of their subjects. The Committee have reason to fear that the direct and ie Under Secretary of State, Foreign Officeand immediate result of Italian action against the Asiatic possessions of the Sultan, coupled with the report that some of the neutral Powers intend to take advantage of Turkey’s difficulties to her detriment. will he to impel large bodies of Mussulmans from India as well as the Frontier to endeavour to reach the seat of war as volunteers, and it would he impossible for His Majesty’s Government to repress the movement without risk of great unpopularity. So long as the war was confined to the regions for the conquest of which it was undertaken the Asiatic Mussulmans were not brought into direct touch with the conflict; and the influence of this League and of other Mahommedan bodies in India and elsewhere was directed to allaying the natural excitement among their own people by pointing to the evident desire of His Majesty’s Government to use their good offices at the first favourable opportunity to bring about a termina tion of the war on equitable terms honourable to Turkey. But the extension of hostilities to the Dardanelles and places within reach of Constantinople, which is re garded; regarded by the bulk of the Mussulman world as the seat of the Caliphate, is calculated to act as an incentive to the war-like elements alike in the neighbouring States and in India to organise a system of volunteering for the assistance of Turkey. The Secretary of State is aware of the extreme in convenience to Mussulman pilgrims and the loss to Indian commerce that has been occasioned by the Italian blockade of the Red Sea ports. The Committee are requested by many of their Indian co-religionists to submit that the injury caused by the Italian action has been far greater than is usually Imagined; for large bodies of pilgrims have been unable to leave Hedjaz for fear of capture by the Italian ships of war, and that the suffering and distress among them is very great. The present hostili ties by intensifying the hatred against Italy will further aggravate the difficulties that stand in the way of an early restoration of peace. The v/hole Mussulman world, not without reason, looks upon His Majesty’s Government as the upholder of justice and fair play, and the Comnittee believe that the~r HTT-WW—im 'if rTTTIMBllBMrTMMMHHIWr’iBWi gi'HW'*! iidHUrTlTlTlM the interests of England are directly involved in the maintenance of peace, not only in the Balkans, hut in the whole of the Near East.
