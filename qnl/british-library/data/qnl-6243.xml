There was admittedly some months delay between the sudden departure of Shaikh Sultan and the granting of power of attorney to Shaikh Moh’d. Apart from this, any delay appears to have been caused by the failure of H.M.G to reply regarding the rates for guards. Whenever the Shaikh has reminded me about the delay in reopening negotiations, I have always replied that we were referring to London and I can hardly now inform him that he is responsible for the delay.

I agree in the main with his objections, but consider that they would all be adequately met by altering the phrasing under paragraph 16 (a) and defining an authorised person as someone who is appointed by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast. Unfortunately by assuming responsibility for administering control of air navigation at Sharjah it would presumably be necessary for H.M.G. to pay the salaries of those concerned in the administration, but I do not see what other alternative there is to be found so long as the governments of the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms remain in the present primitive stage. 3.

In view of the primitive condition of the local administration, I can see a grave objection to the Shaikh being asked to subscribe to Regulations on the lines of the Kuwait Regulations. 3. At present, air traffic is handled by the aerodrome without either customs or immigration control, this, for the reason that the Ruler is unable to enforce either. I should hesitate to inform the Shaikh that he may appoint 'authorized persons” under article 16, to perform the functions described in articles 6,7,8,12, and 14. In a civilized state, such intervention by the local authority would be perfectly proper and would be of advantage but I fear that an ’’authorized person” in Trucial Coast might include such trouble-makers as head guards who would seek to use their position to extend their power arid perquisites. The present Ruler of Sharjah would no doubt accept our advice in all these matters, but there is no guarantee that in the future, one might not be confronted by the sort of intolerable interference from which Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Ltd suffered last winter at the hands of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi’s ’’amirs” in the drilling camp. 4. I suggest that it might be better for us to ask the Shaikh of Sharjah to signify his willingness for H.M.G to administer control of Air Navigation on his behalf, rather than that we should give him nominal control of matters beyond his ability to understand, and at the same time, an excuse for possible future mischief.

In view of the speed with which we rushed this through, I feel that there is even more justifi cation than usual In his complaint about our beleted- ness in concluding the new Air Agreement. I presume we caimot use General Department*s letter Ho.QA 96/3 of 23rd Bay, forwarded to me under your complimentary slip Ro.308/13/50 of 6th June, as an authority for payment of the guards in anticipation of the signature of the new Agreement, particularly in view of the fact that no date is mentioned from which the Increased pay would be effective. Presumably in accordance with Article 13 (i) of the new Agreement, the increased rates in pay will only be in force from the date of the signature and not from the date of expiry of the old Agreement in July 1948. If this Is so * I feel that our delay Is depriving Shaikh Muhas^ed of sums which are really his due. If the matter is going to drag on such longer, I would be grateful if you would con sider raising the question with the Foreign Office of the payment of guards prior to the signature of the Agreement. 3. I enclose a copy also of a letter 1 have addressed in reply to that of Shaikh Muhammad, in which 1 have given him certain assurances and at the same time asked for his approval for the suggested Increase in rent to cover the extension.

I should be grateful if you could inform H.E. the Political Resident that a second approach has now been made by Shaikh Moh*d. Owing to the expenses involved in maintaining his brother in Bombay, He has been unable to make the annual agreed payment to the Beni Qitab. Moh^ bin Ali al Huwaidir is pressing hard, and as I see it, we can hardly save Moh*d bin Saqr from his wrath, as we were witnesses to the agreement of Sharjah to pay the annual Rs. 15000/- *•«*** ■*'* &lt;- 3. In order to avoid unfortunate incidents, whidh we could not prevent, Shaikh Moh'd requires the money at once, and I should be grateful if this matter could be dealt with urgently. C.J. Felly Esq.
