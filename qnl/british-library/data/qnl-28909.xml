There are indications of the Arab movement spreading to the north. I he only point which is unsatisfactory is the presence of eight Turkish aeroplanes at Medina Command of the air is all important in guerilla warfare, and the Arabs are discouraged if they find their movements observed, as it cancels such con- dence as they may have in a hope of surprising their enemy, which is their only chance of successful military action. .. The cypher used by thie Arab Bureau is very faulty, and leads to many errors in transmitting proper names. The report of the capture of 20 , 000 L in o-old may be an error m cyphering for 2,0001 . if it is not it is probably true ; it would not be in the inteiests of an Arab commander to exaggerate the quantity of loose cash in his possession, as the booty has to be shared out among a good many people. The presence of Oppenheim and twenty-two Germans in Medina might be given due publicity in the press. Syria. The murder of the Catholic (Uniat) Syriac Patriarch at Mardin is of somewhat sinister import. Hitherto the Syrian Christians (both Uniat and Jacobite) have escaped the general persecution. It may be that the Turks fear that, in the event of a Russian advance down the Bitlis Pass, the Arabs and Kurds may make common cause with the Christians against them, and have decided to produce massacres in order to inspire a fear of Russian reprisals in the minds of the Moslems. This is the usual policy. Arab Propaganda. The success of the “ Kawkab ” is to be noticed. British Correspondents and the Turco-Arab Question. Fn this report is published the singular observation of Mr. Ward Price on the sportsmanlike qualities of the Turks referred to in the last report, XXYI. Further, there is added, by way of contrast, Mr. Candler’s references to the Marsh Arabs. It is perfectly true that the individual Anatolian soldier is frequently per se a decent stolid fellow, and as frequently per accidens the most effective instrument in the hands of ruthless officials. The aboriginal inhabitant of the Mesopotamian swamps is equally truly a wild, treacherous, lawless savage, while the mixed riparian tribes of [898—27]Irak are congenital Anarchists for geographical and historical reasons. However, the net result of this sort of wi lting is to fix m o e ea 0 _ , , , i . 1^1 primary ideas : Turk = good, honest, fond of children, &amp;c.; Arab _ bad, black-hea . rogue &amp;c ; both of which are contrary to fact and policy. If on the Western every fault of the French or Belgian peasants was magnified, and the courage, discipline and resistance of the Germans was extolled, the situation would not be improved It is suggested that correspondents with our forces in the East should be given a de i , line in this matter, which, if adhered to, would save the censors a great deal of trouble. The Italians and the Asia Minor Question. Attention is drawn to the attitude of the “ Idea Nazionale.” The newspaper m question is evidently in close touch with the situation. ^ ^ January 25, 191i.[TMg Doaunie nt^tiie Property of His Britannic Majesty's : &gt; 8 '' ^ -t:— Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 17th January saying that from information received there were indications that following on raids by tribesmen acting independently south and south-west of Medina, Turks were nervous regarding communications with that place, and by retiring two battalions probably of 55th Regiment from Kheif (Jedeida) to Bir Abbas, Bir Raha, and district of the latter, were accordingly reinforcing their line between Bir Abbas and Bir Derwish.

Wingate was informed by the Foreign Office on the 18th January [No. 46] that there was no objection on the part of the High Commissioner of Cyprus to the training of Syrians in that island. i he Viceroy of India telegraphed on the oth January that there were in India 214 Armenian prisoners who were desirous of being sent to Cyprus to join the corps, and that twenty Arab Christians a«d one (?) Persian wished to join them. Subject to the approval of the India Cffice, he proposed to send the whole party to Egypt. This was approved by the India Cffice, with the concurrence of the Foreign Cffice. Murder of the Syriac Patriarch of Antioch. The “ Miraat-ul-Gharb ’ of the 23rd December said that on the previous day it had received a telegram announcing the murder, by the Turks, of his Beatitude Ignatius Ephraim II, the Catholic Syria,c Patriarch of Antioch. He was murdered at his residence in Mardin. The exact date was not given. Starvation of the Inhabitants. The “ Times ” of the 20 th January says that the Congregation of the Propaganda in Rome has received information o the effect that 1 10,000 people have died of hunger in the Mount Lebanon district of Syria. At Beirut it vras said 'the starving people fell in the streets and w ere carted av^ay. The Pope sent a large sum of money to the delegate apostolic in Constantinople for distribution in Syria. MESOPOTAMIA. The Viceroy, telegraphing to the Secretary of State for India on the 21 st January [No. 940], said that from all information it appeared that the Turks in the vicinity of Bagdad would be materially strengthened at an early date, possibly by as much as four divisions. IRAK-ARAB!. The Shatt-al-Hai. The Arabs living along the Shatt-al-Hai (which is known locally as the Gharraf, and runs for a distance of about 112 miles between Kut and Nasiriyah), wdio are nearly all Shiah, have always been independent and warlike. In the past they were opposed to the Turks, and defeated several expeditions sent to subdue them; hut when tire4 fPf Turks joined in the present war they sank their differences, and for the most part have assisted them. After the fall of Nasiriyah in July 1915 they allowed the defeated Turkish force to withdraw by this route to Kut. It is estimated that they could turn out some -SO,000 fighting men. who may be roughly divided into a northern group of 11,000 and a southern group of 19,000 rifles. After the taking of Nasiriyah and Kut by us in 1915 the principal Shaykhs made obeisance ; but their attitude soon changed with the situation. When our cavalry recently reached Hai, about two marches below Kut, they were well received; but on leaving they were attacked by the Arabs of the town, and were also attacked throughout their march by irregular forces, probably belonging to the Beni Babia, the strongest tribe at the north of the Hai. At the southern end the majority of the El Ibrahim, Asachirah, and Hussainat tribes, who had hitherto been hostile, made their submission early in December last. The Albu Saad and Beni Zaid. who live on the Shatt-el-Bedaa, south-east of Shattrah, are also friendly, but are held back from making submission by the hostile Khaffajah, Abudah, and certain sections of the Azairich. This means that in the south the country may probably be called friendly between Nasiriyah and Butuniyah. PART II. PERSIA. N.-W. Persia and Kurdistan'. At Kirmanshah (town) a Persian Democrat Committee (an offshoot of the C.U.P.), under the leadership of Nizam-es-Sultaneh, is doing its utmost to assist our enemies, without, however, having achieve'! much success. The bulk of the Lurs have openly sided with the Turks, but their assistance has been of little military value. On the other hand, the Sinjabis, a Kurdish tribe of the Kirmanshah district, have recently left the Turks. ^ J The Bakhtiari. Several of the minor khans have joined the Turks, and on the 4 th January some 2 0 ° Bakhtuan were dispersed by Russian troops 17 miles south-west of Ispahan, sixty ot them number being killed. A proposal is on foot to rnise a police force, with British ?r C ?y?u Y fc 7 as thou ? ht would greatly strengthen the hands of the chief khan the Ukham, who has remained loyal to us, and avert the disaster of the Bakhtiari uoin^ over masse to the Turks. I he expressed intention of the Ilkhani to keep an armed force of 2 ,o 00 men in the Chehar Mahal hills throughout the winter has caused s„me misgivings. Western Ears. On the 17th and 18th December detachments of the South Persian Rifles at Kazerun and Dashtarjm on the Bushire-Shiraz road, were captured by rebels, who weie unsuccessfully attacked on the 25th December by a small column from Shiraz Great scarcity prevails at Shiraz, where Sir P.

The Viceroy telegraphed on the 22 nd January that the British agent had had an interview with the Amir. He tone of the Amir’s conversation was Intire] v friendly and corroborated the belief of the Indian Government in his sincere desire to remain neutral. But he expressed concern m regard to our military activity on the North- West ion icr, and was evidently afraid that punitive action against tribal territory was contemplated ; tnis he deprecated in the strongest terms as likely to cause a general connagration. Me also enquired as to the road making m the vicinity of Khyber as he had received reports that officers an 1 possibly new roads had crossed doubtful territory. The Viceroy was sending a letter reassuring the Amir on both points. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. Report of the Arab Bureau. The report of the Arab Bureau for December contains an account of good work done; the point of greatest interest is perhaps what it says about the new Arab paper:— “ The ‘ Kawkab ’ is now being produced along the lines of a definite policy and the improvement of its last few numbers is already noticeable. It had origin all-, been intended to keep its origin secret but, in practice, this was found to be impossible. Accordingly, the help of the leaders of the Arab movement in Cairo was enlisted and the paper is now definitely associated with them, in the eyes of the public. It forms a useful supplement to the Mecca paper the ‘ Kibla,’ and having at its disposal material which is unknown to the Meccan editors, is able to expose the real aims of Germany and Turkey in a manner which, it is hoped, will have a considerable propagandist value. Well known members of the Arab party, such as Rafik Bey el Adm have already contributed to it.” Coronation of the Empress of Abyssinia. This will take place early in February, and on the 17th January Mr. Ihesiger telegraphed [No. 4 ], saying that, if England, France, and Italy could send representa tives, advantage might be taken of the occasion to present a general warning as to the necessity for reforms and reasonable government in the future. His french and Italian colleagues agreed with him that this would produce an effect. The representatives of England, France, and Italy at Adis Ababa are being specially accredited for the occasion of the coronation. The King of Siam, and the King of Hejaz. In his despatch of the 30th November, Mr. Dering, British Minister at Bangkok, said that Prince Devawongse had proposed to the King of Siam that the teleginm iiom [898—l7 | 06 I * Mecca announcing the assumption of the royal style by the Sherif and the congratula tory Siamese reply should be inserted only in the Government gazette. I he King of Siam, however, thought that they would make an excellent impression on his Moslem 'subjects, and instructed his private secretary to send copies to the “Siam Observer” [see Arabian Report, N.S., XIX, 6 ], and also to a vernacular paper. Prince Devawongse told Mr. Dering that, after the publication, the German and Austrian charges d’affaires;^ had called on Mr. Pitkin, adviser in foreign affairs, who drafted the reply telegram, and also ou the piince himself, and argued that the telegram implied recognition of the new state, which neither the Prince nor Mr. Pitkin would allow. PART IV. CUTTINGS FROM THE PRESS. Enemy Propaganda in the English Press. The “Daily Mail” published the following in its issue of the 16th January; it is taken from a telegram sent by its correspondent at S ilonica, Mr. G. Ward Price :— “ Here as in Gallipoli our men have formed a high opinion of the sportsmanlike qualities ol the Tuik as a soldier. Iheir treatment of any wounded who fall into their hands after an encounter seems to be as good as their more primitive organisation permits.” [This was accidentally omitted from report No. XXVi, though referred to in the Appreciation.] The Marsh Arab. Mr. Edmund Candler writes as follows:— “ The‘mashoof ’ is dear to the heart of that enemy of all men the Marsh As no one trusts the Marsh Arab, and those not born in ‘ mash oofs ’ cannot keep them from capsizing its value for transport is nil.” [“Daily Mail 19th January, 1917.] l „ , Italy s Claims in Asia Minor. “rv 1116 Nazionale” (15th January) takes occasion from the statement of the rf^ the , tl f e J h ^ s come for ‘[proclaiming the rights of Italy in the Eastern Mediterranean to defh e its conception of those rights. tinn f fn iaS n T h + t n° ^ S £ aits 18 fu,1 J ac cepted, and the more readily as the recogni- on of his right by the Entente may be regarded as proof of the intention to deal systematically with the rights of the Allies generally, including those of Italy.

The Aeab Movement. 1 be situation in Hejaz remains stationary, and the question of the British brigade being despatched to Rabegh remains unsettled until the King declares himself responsible for the introduction of Christians into Hejaz. He is little likely to do this unless his affairs are at a desperate pass. The value of the Arab movement to the Entente Powers is shown by the table on p. 1 to amount to the cancelling of no less than live Turkish divisions, which would, under other circumstances, be liberated for service in Europe or against the Caucasus or Mesopotamia.

Fahad Ibn Hadh- dhal of the Amarat Anazeh Eastern Syrian Desert If he definitely joifns, Nuri Esh Shalaan will strengthen the latter, and so cause greater danger to the Ilejaz communications, and possibly hoi.d up more troops The above shows the equivalent of about five Turkish divisions and a cavalry reoirnent already contained by disaffected Mohammedans, while several elements hostile to the Turks have not yet been fully mobilized. (2.) Hejaz. The General Situation. i. e., No the Rabegh. further Turkish advance in Hejaz has been reported since the 28fch December : most advanced Turkish troops are at Bir ibn Hassani, 70 miles north of Reliable information proves that the Turkish expeditionary force based on Medina has not been increased above its former strength of 12 , 000 . The force is short of winter clothing, and at the end of December the sick in hospital numbered 1 , 200 . Scurvy is increasing daily. Two train-loads of stores arrived at Medina on the 15th December, but apparently there were only eleven waggons on the two trains. The Turks are also embarrassed by extreme shortage of gold in the Hejaz treasure chest, owing to large cash payments having been made for supplies received from Central Arabia. On the 1 st January, Abdullah, with his force of Arabs reached Hanakiyah, 80 miles NNE. of Medina, making it impossible for the Turks to obtain further supplies from Central Arabia. Meanwhile, the local tribes have been harrying the main Turkish tine of communications, along the Hejaz Railway ; and on the 9 th December a Turkish repairing party was successfully attacked near Hadizah, 110 miles north of Medina The road communications between Medina and the advanced Turkish troops have also been subject to constant Arab raids, the most imporcant of which resulted in the capture of 400 camels near Bir Darwesh (24 miles south-west of Medina). On the 3rd January it was reported that, according to a deserter’s statement, the recent luikish advance towards the Wadi Safra was a reconnaissance only, and the j urks were confident of their ability to reach Rabegh £: whenever they like.’’ ' In view of the many difficulties and embarrassments to which the Turks in this theatre are subject, and which are summarised above, it is considered that, so long as supplies continue to be received at Medina, the Turks will not venture far from that base. ^ The complete severance of the Turkish communications might, however, have the effect of causing the Turks to advance on Mecca in full strength, as a desperate measure to avert starvation or surrender. The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 3rd January [A.B. 524] that the contingent on Yambo and Rabegh being sufficiently strongly held, Faisal proposed to march on Wejh and then on El Ula, co-operating with Abdulla, who will move from Hanariyshof ^noivtn 8 ' This I ’ 11 hara - SS th , e Hnes of comml,n ication to Medina, and open lines the X P 'ern tXs' W Pr r 1 Y 0 n l fr0m Weih Ple ! ,uff ’ and hasten th « co-opendion of r?, * ri, I es - Wad .y Yenbo appears to be still clear of the Turks. . , , Ara b Bureau telegraphed again on the 9th January [A.B. 5661 that there A Brigade for Rabegh. ft ‘ U \ ir ! l%yptelegraphed to C.I.G.S. that the King had agreed to convnopd h* f ?t be § h ’ Sa ^ m ^ that ’ as the Hi g h Commissioner had .onymced him ot the utility of landing a force by saying that be saw that there were unless +h h'T 6 k ! ng tha * the Tu,ka mi S ht be successful in their advance ...Hess the Arab force operating in the interior had a base from which they could operate to cut the lurkish communications, and to which they might retire in case of need. Consequently he begged that the High Commissioner might be immediately mloimed that he approved the landing of a force for the purpose stated, not only at Kabegh but also at \ ambo. . ^ Sir It. W ingate telegraphed on the 6 th January [No. 15] that :— (a.) He had received a formal application from the King for a British brigade to be landed at Rabegh. ( 6 .) He had accordingly arranged with the G.O.C.-in-C. that a brigade should be ’ despatched from Suez as soon as possible. (c.) The brigade would be commanded by Brigadier-General Mudge, who would he given the status of a divisional general, and be in command of all foreiom units operating in Hejaz. (d.) Colonel Wilson retained his position, and with his staff would act as political advisers and intelligence officers. (e.) The King had been made to understand that he was responsible for the security of the British contingent from local interference ; and he had been asked to notify the general line he would take in explaining the nresence of Christian troops in Hejaz. (/•) The King had been asked to notify his sons that a vigorous offensive against Turkish communications with Medina would now be looked for. (g.) He was in communication with Colonel Bremond in regard to the transport of French contingents. ( ' \ In reply to this the Foreign Office telegraphed on the 8 th January [No. 19] that the Cabinet had decided that the brigade should not be sent unless and until the King of Hejuz had ( 1 ) in writing made a request for its despatch, and accepted full responsibility lor the presence of] Christian troops in Hejaz; and ( 2 ) had prepared for issue to the Moslem world a suitable proclamation explaining why Christian troops had been landed, which proclamation must, before issue, be submitted to His Majesty’s Government. This crossed a telegram [No. 22 ] from Sir B. Wingate, saying that Colonel Wilson had already been instructed that before the landing of Christian troops in Hejaz could be sanctioned the King must, in writing : (T) confirm the application he had made in a cipher telegram, and ( 2 ) give assurances in regard to the reception, by the Arab commanders and tribesmen, of Christian troops. Also that in the course of the negotiations, the following points had been made clear to the King :— 1 . The despatch of a British brigade had been recommended as the only thing which could obstruct a Turkish advance on Mecca ; but it would only be sent with his formal sanction. 2 . It would be withdrawn if local Arabs showed any sign of hostility or interference ; and in any case if the menace of a Turkish advance was removed. 3. The brigade would be immobile. Sir R. Wingate said that he considered the assurances he had required from the King to be sufficient; he fully appreciated the political objections to the despatch of Christian troops, but he considered those objections, in comparison with the risks involved in a collapse of the Arab revolt, to be of secondary importance. [898—26] 1 B4 On the 10 th January Sir It. Wingate telegraphed [No. 29] that Colonel Wilson had reported that the King had asked that the despatch of the troops might be delayed. Colonel Wilson had been instructed to inform him that further procrastination would prevent the sending of the troops. The King’s final reply would be telegraphed as soon as it was received. Senegalese Troops not available. The Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir It. Wingate on the 5th January [No 6 ] informing him that there had been a tribal rising near Jibuti, in consequence oi which the French Government could not spare the Senegalese troops. r i. -U ... - Arab Officers for the King. On the 5th January four Turkish officers of Arab nationality left London for Egypt en route for Hejaz to take service with the King. The King’s Style. Sir It. Wingate telegraphed on the 7 th January [No 17] saying that the King had again expressed a wish to be styled Jelala. Tnis was the usual style for one bearing title “Melik” and had been used by both the French Mission and His Majesty’s Government; he would suggest therefore that the employment of Jelala in lieu of Siyada be approved. Indian Seditionists. Sir K. Wingate, telegraphed on the 7 th January [No. 18] that he was of opinion that Mahmoud Hassan and other Indian seditionists in Hejaz should be interned, but was in favour of that being done in Malta rather than in Egypt. The question had been referred to Colonel Wilson and he awaited his recommendations definite proposals. before making: O (3 .) Asir. The Decoration of Idrisi deferred. On the 6 th January, Mr. Balfour telegraphed l No. 18] to Sir B. Wingate that the India Office was not anxious to proceed further in regard to the decoration of Idrisi; therefore it and the consequential offer of a decoration to the King should be deferred for the moment, especially as the grant of a Christian order might embarrass the latter. The Farsan Islands. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 3rd January [307 A.P.] saying that the salient point of Idrisi’s letter was that the hoisting of the British flag was unnecessary and a reflection on our disinterestedness. If aggression came from an Allied Power, it would be sufficient for us to intimate that the islands were under our protection ; if it came from a hostile Power, the hoisting of the British flag would be useless, for the Suez Canal must have been lost first. (4.) Aden. Increase of Turkish Garrisons. The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 6 th January [No. 90] that reports indicated that in the enemy’s advanced posts the Turkish garrisons had been increased and that the Arabs had been largely withdrawn. (5.) Jebel Shammar. Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 3rd January [T. 263] that there had been, since last spring, strained relations between Ibn Rashid and his brother-in-law Baud Ibn Saleh A1 Subhan. Sand has now finally broken with Ibn Rashid, and has placed himself at our disposal for raiding and other purposes. He claims to be able to gather to his banner most of the Shammar ; the Aslam section is already with us ; Ismail Bey is of opinion fthat Saud can gather the A bdah to him, and this would leave with Ibn Rashid only the Sinjara section. Three courses are open to us:— 1 . We might endeavour to establish an understanding between Saud and Ibn Saud with a view to a combined attack on Ibn Rashid. 2 . Sand might be kept employed on this side endeavouring to draw the Shammar away from Ibn Rashid, so that Ibn Saud might be the better able to attack him on the north-east, and Ibn Shaalan from the west. Sir P. Cox was of opinion that, in view of the Turkish guns said to be with Ibn Rashid, not much would result from either of these courses, but thare remained:— 3. That it the Aslarn, under Ibn Tawalah, and the Abdah were prepared to back Saud and proclaim him Emir we should give the movement our moral support in the hope of the Shammar deserting Ibn Rashid ; we must assist Saud financially but should make it clear that there would be no question of troops mov mg out to his assistance. In regard to this he said it must be remembered that Jebel Shammar has only been independent of Nejd for seventy years, and our support of a new Emir might not be palatable to Ibn Saud as there can be no doubt of his hope and ambition to recover sway over it. At the same time it would be greatly in the interests of ourselves and the King of Hejaz to eliminate Ibn Rashid, the only remaining stand-by of the Turks in Central Arabia. It is a matter of common knowledge that he is a hot-headed truculent youth wholly subservient to the enemy who regard his adherence as of the highest importance. In regard to this Sir R. Wingate telegraphed to Sir P. Cox on the 9th January informing him that the Arab Bureau had suggested certain objections : In regard to the course numbered (3) above, the Bureau said that Saud was a Shubha, not a Rashid, and his capacity to bring in the whole Shammar was doubtful. By open support of him we saould commit ourselves to maintaining Hail against Riadh, even if the support were only moral. The note favoured the other two courses and preferred the second on the ground that Ibn Saud had two Rashid pretenders with him, Dhari and Faisal Ibn Fahd : Dhari it was said was a favourite of Ibn Saud, and it seemed unlikely that Faisal would support Saud. Sir R. Wingate expressed the opinion that these views were deserving of serious consideration. And on the 9 th January Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy saying that if there was a reasonable probability that the Shammar could be detached from Ibn Rashid and used by us to military advantage, the chums of Ibn Saud to Jebel Shammar were notstrong enough to prevent us from giving moral support to Af Subhan. Sir Percy Cox telegraphed on the 6 th January that reliable information had been received that a caravan from Hail had been intercepted by Saud-as-Saleh on its way to Kerbela.* Saud is reported to have taken many rifles and some 6,000 liras from caravan. ' SYRIA. French Syr ian Ley ion. The French Government is raising a foreign legion for service against Jhe Turks ; the legion will be comprised of Syrians and Armenians, who will oe divided into groups according to race and religion. On the 7 th January Sir R. Wingate telegraphed [No. 20 J that the French Minister had asked whether he might recruit Syrian volunteers in Egvpt, and send them to be trained with the Armenians in Cyprus. He saw no objection so long as those liable to serve in the Egyptian army weie not taken , but he did not think that many would present themselves. * This sounds impossible; if. may be that the caravan was on its way from Kerbela to Hail. pi) 1’HINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C, U. 11A1UUSON.— lV/l / 1 hi 7.SECRET. APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARABIAN REPORT No. XXYI (New Series). Rabegh. THE Rabegh question appears now to be definitely settled. It is to be noted that the French party has been doing nothing for the last three months at Suez, and has made its movement contingent on the establishment of a British garrison at Rabegh. As this garrison is not going to be established, the future of the French contingent should, be considered. British Operations in Sinai. The political eftect of the action at Raffa brings us within reach of another phase of the Arab question, namely, that of the Syrian Arabs. Enemy Propaganda in the British Press. Mr. Ward Price, correspondent of the “Daily Mail” at Salonica, is reviving the legend of the “ clean-fighting Turk.” In view of the Entente Note to President Wilson, expressing in plain terms the horror and indignation which Turkish treatment of Armenians and Arabs has evoked in the minds of the Entente Powers, and further stating the determination of the Entente to remove the Turks from Europe, this kind of stuff can only serve enemy aims by exposing us to the charge of hypocrisy or inconsistency. The grounds for Mr. Price’s statements are probably the usual ones, careful atmospheric preparation of Mr. Price’s mind by the Salonica agents, whicn is the home of the U.U.P., and the fact that Turkish officials never leave a living witness of an outrage if they can help it. ° J M. S. [8'J8—25]2 The Viceroy telegraphed on the 16th January that Sir Percy Cox had already been instructed to strike out the words, and had doubtless informed those concerned in suitable terms. The Government of India, however, deprecated participation, even to the extent of suggesting that the Shaykhs should send a messenger under a safe'''' conduct. Moreover, it seemed premature to encourage them to definitely commit themselves. Indian Undesirables. On the 13th January the Viceroy of India telegraphed to Cairo saying that it had been reported that Mahmoud Hassan, having been driven out of Mecca, was returning to India. It was considered important that he should not return there, and it was hoped that, if he left Hejaz, arrangements would be made to intern him in Egypt or Malta. On the same day Sir P. Wingate reported the deportation of six undesirables to whence they would be sent to Malta; he added that it was estimated that there were twenty of them in all. Asir. The Farsan Islands. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 11 th January that he had received a telegram from Colonel J acob giving the result of his interview with Idrisi; and again on the 14th January that Lieutenant Nalder had arrived at Aden with letters from Colonel Jacob giving the details of his interview. The contents of the two telegrams may be summarized as follows :— 1 . Idrisi was greatly upset by our hoisting the British flag, and by the presence of the guard. He said that the flag was as repugnant at Farsan as it would be at Jizan, and was likely to draw down Turkish vengeance, as implying the cession of the island to us and, further, it would preclude future favour qua arms from France and Italy. 2 . He was prepared to sign an agreement the main points of which would be : (a.) No cession or mortgage of the Farsan islands, or of any interest therein, to any foreign Power. ( 6 .) Protection by the British Government from foreign aggression. 3. He also engaged himself to effectively occupy the islands and to maintain his flag thereon. The Resident added that, unless he should be otherwise instructed, he was telling; Colonel Jacob to make the agreement and remove the flag. ® Aden. The G O C. telegraphed on the 12 th January [No. 114] that Saiyid Ahmad Pasha and Kazi ol laiz were reported to have gone home early in January and that the estimated decrease, since the 13th December, of the Arab irregulars with Said Pasha was 300 ; the majority of them having gone since the 1 st January ; and on the following day [No. 126] he telegraphed that the reports that, on or about the 3 rd January two mountain guns had left for Yemen, were regarded as confirmed • • f Th 5 telegra P h t d T th ® , 15th Januar y t 312 A.P.] that l le had been informed by the Governor oi Erythrea (through the Indian eonsul in Aden) of a well confirmed report that Lij Yasu had fled from Donkalia with the object of embarW lor Shaykh baKfi where the commandant was said to expect him.

On the 26th October, 1916, there was no water in the Hai river bed at Shattrah or below the first 10 miles on the Shatt-el-Bedaa (ioining the Shatt-al-Hai with the -Hammar Lake). On the 30th October aeroplane reconnaissance found the Shatt-el-Bedaa dry throughout its course to its junction with the Hammar Lake. When full, at high- water season, the Bedaa is navigable for motor-boats. (ii.) Hammar Lake. Water Levels. Oct. 27, 1916. i Nov 4, 1916. 1 - — ~ Nov. 11, 1916.

It was thought that the Akikah rise might be due to the south wind. On the 7 th November O.O. Akikah wired that the minimum depth in the Hammar Lake was then ^ ft. 1 in., and that heliums could be loaded to 2 -feet draught, which would considerably facilitate the matter of supply. This rise in the level of the lake was thought curious, as there had been no corresponding rise in the gauge readings at Nasiriyah between the 4th and 7th November, though between the 27th October and the 4th November there had been a rise of 2 J inches at Nasiriyah. (iii.) Routes from A fa] to the Tigris. In addition to the well-watered route to Bghailah, a route has been reported to exist from Afaj to Mahairjah, near the northern end of the Shatt-al-Hai. This route is also reported to be well watered, and may afford passage for considerable bodies of troops.4 Tigris Line. ^ . ■. » Lieutenant-Colonel Gressmann is reported to have arrived m Bagdad about t e end of October as “ German Commissioner in Iraq. .. ^ Shavkh Hatim-ibn-Saihud, of the Al-bu-Mohammed tribe was reported fronT' Amarah, on the 4th November, to have fled to the Turks This Shaykh was consp.cuous in his enmity to us in the first half of 1915, being one of the last to make submission after the capture of Amarah. On the 5th November he was reported to be in Mai town (on the Shatt-al-Hai), and to have defected owing to the blocking of the Jaw war Canal,® as regards “mahaila” traffic, by the bridge carrying the Qurnah-Amarah ^/subsequently transpired that Hatim had carefully collected all revenues due to him before taking his departure. At the beginning of December Hatim was reporte to be with Bedr Rumayidh, the chief shaykh of the Al-bu-Saleh tribe on the JNahi Bedaa, about 10 miles north of Lake Hammar, who has been passively hostile to us for a long time. . Bedr Rum ay id h was also accompanied by Shaykh Hassacn (of the Beni Mausm), Shaykh Faris, and Shaykh Zaboon (the latter also of the Al-bu-Mohammed tribe). Hassach is the cousin of the friendly Shaykh Hamud, of Medina (on the Lower Euphrates); he is hostile to us, and recently made an abortive raid on Medina. Shaykh Faris is unknown. These shaykhs were reported to have received rifles and money from the Turks recently. Ghadban, principal shaykh of the Beni Lam, was showing signs of restlessness at the beginning of November. Arab Labour. About the middle of November difficulty was reported in finding the necessary labour at Ali Gharbi and on the Tigris road near there. The harvesting of the summer crop prevented tribal Arabs taking up this work except under pressure. The political officer had some hope of getting men in from Pusht-i-Kuh. Persian Frontier. Arming of Persian Tribes. An Algerian trooper, who was captured at Arras in June 1916, and escaped from Bagdad on the 11 th October, said that there were 75 Germans there, and that 10,000 Fieneh rifles, with 700 boxes of ammunition, had been despatched to Persia by the Germans to arm the tribesmen. This statement was confirmed by an agent, who stated that a large consignment of rifles had been sent to Nizam-es-Sultan eh (believed to have raised the irregular Persian “Division of Vengeance” early in 1916 for service with the Turks on the Persian frontier). On the 20 th October Captain Napier wrote from the camp of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh that Nizam-es-Sultaneh had raised 2,000 tribal levies, and that there w ere about. 500 more at Kermanshah. On the same date Capiain Noel wrote from Dizful that Nasr Ali Khan, a Lur chief, had again joined the lurks, and that Nizam-es- Suitaneh was at Kermanshah, while Sirdar Muhi, formerly associated with one of the German parties in Persia, had been appointed governor of Burujird by the Germans in the place of Ali Mardan, the former governor appointed by the Russians. Nasr Ali Khan was said to he in Burujird with Sirdar Muhi, and most of the Luristan tribes to be on their side. The Bairanwand section of these tribes, however, under Ali Mardau, had remained faithful to the Russians, and was said to be doing good work. In the middle of November news was received from Captain Napier confirming previous information that tribal levies sent from Kermanshah to madan after mid-October dispersed to their homes en route, and stating that Nizam e ultaneh was still at Kermanshah on the 27th October, having postponed his departure rHamadan. The Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh. The Waifs “ amlah ” was, on the 20 th October, at Doab about 7 miles east- south-east of Zorbatieh according to Captain Napier, and our aircraft located it about 1 mile north-west of Kala Sayid Hassan (i.e., in the same locality) on the 31st October * The Nahr Jawwar takes out of the Tigris by the right bank about 12 miles below Amarah. Mahailas are vessels with masts which cannot easily be unstepped.when a demonstration was made by 6 machines to impress the Wali. Captain Napier subsequently wrote that this demonstration had had considerable effect on the Wali, who hid for the first two hours, and, when he emerged, first stated that the aircraft 'jpv'ere Turkish and then that he had asked the British to send aircraft to visit him Jtarly m November it was reported that the Wali had sent his wife and son to -bagdad tor medical treatment. 4 -n previously accepted the medical advice of Captain Napier it was ought that this action might indicate that he had heard of the arrival of considerable lurkish reinforcements. ^However, on the 12 th November news was received that the Wali was moving qi 8 u a i m j 1 and had sent for his son Amanullah Khan. His brother bhahab ud Dowleh was apparently to stay near Kala Sayid Hassan. Both the brother and son are said to be well disposed to us. Shatt-al-Hai. On the 13th November water was flowing down the Shatt-al-Hai to within half a mile of Bessouia Ford. This marked the beginning of the annual flow down this water course. Supplies reaching the Enemy. On the 3rd November it was reported that the Assistant Political Officer, Basrah, ) had made considerable captures of oil and piece-goods in course of conveyance to the enemy. A recent Jewish arrival from Bagdad had stated that 5,000 tins of oil had been received in Bagdad lately, and that these tins had been purchased on the South-W^est Persian front. General Baratoff had been informed as this oil was thought to have most probably come from Baku; the price in Bagdad (reported as 25 rupees or \l. 13s. 4 d.) being a sufficient inducement for smuggling. A Jew who left Bagdad at the end of October confirmed that there was a considerable leakage of Indian cotton goods from Nasiriyah and Amarah to Bagdad, and that the price for these goods had consequently fallen in the last six months. Basra. New Mosque. The G.O.C., Mesopotamia, having represented that it would be well that a mosque should be built in Basra for our Indian soldiers to prevent them from coming into contact with undesirable political influences in the ordinary mosques, the Nizam of Hyderabad was approached, and His Highness expressed his willingness to contribute 25,000 rupees. Ismail Bey. Sir p. Cox telegraphed on the 12 th January [T. 354] that Ismail Bey was the third son out of six, the eldest being dead. He is 28 years of age. He is on good terms with Khalil, who is especially respected by the Milli, and has with him some 1,400 semi-trained Hamediyah. Khansa Khanum is his own mother. A year ago he and his brothers were engaged south of Lake Van against the Bussians, but quarrelled with the Turks and returned to their own country. Ismail went south to join the Sherif, but was arrested and imprisoned at Lamascus; from that place he succeeded in getting a letter through to Sherif Haidar in Constantinople, who arranged his release on condition of his joining the Turks on the Egyptian front. He promised to do this, but went to Ibn Shaalan. SYBIA AND ABMENIA. In their reply to Mr. Wilson’s Note, the Allies referred to the massacre of hundreds of thousands of inoffensive Armenians and the barbarous treatment of the Syrian population, and set out among the objects of the war the freeing of the peoples subject to the murderous tyranny of the Turks, and the casting out of Europe of the Turkish Empire. PRIHTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.— -18/1/1917.m^Ci'rvQ- ip • ...m The Internal CoNDiTiON or Turkey. The letter from Manchester given in Part III of this report is most interesting : it indicates what an Ottoman subject estimates the condition of Turkey to be, reading between the lines of his censored letters. This estimate coincides exactly wdth what other information goes to show, namely, that Turkey is nearing the end of her resources. Turkey will doubtless hold out to the end, and the moral of her army will be the last thing to give way, but it is quite possible that she may collapse even though she may not surrender. India and the Haj Pilgrimage. On p. 2 will be found a reference to the Indian pilgrimage to Mecca. It is regrettable that, after all the trouble and expense that the .British Government was put to in making the pilgrims comfortable, this event should have been completely ignored by the press in India. In Egypt, and in Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco, the success of the pilgrimage was given great prominence in the native press ; it is suggested that even now some steps might be taken by the Indian Government to make capital out of the affair. When the Sherif rebelled we were overwhelmed with alarums and excursions of a literary kind, both native and British ; when pious Moslems are enabled to accomplish their duties, silence is our reward. Armenian Massacres. On p. 6 will be found an item regarding the arming of the Turkish civil population of Mersina ; this is the usual prelude to a massacre. British Prisoners in Turkish Hands. On p. 5 an agent’s report gives a painful glimpse of what our prisoners of war suffer in Turkey. The Turks would only laugh at retaliation. There is.not much hope of remedy of this state of affairs until we have re-established our moral ascendency in the field ; the chivalrous qualities of the Turks are generally enhanced when they think there is a possibility of defeat and retribution.

He had appointed General Clayton as his chief staff officer for Hejaz affairs- the Arab Bureau would continue to be under his, General Clayton's’ immediate direction. j ’ (b.)

It has been ascertained that— 1 . Part, at any rate, of the 43rd Division is with the Hejaz Expeditionary Force, probably on the lines of communication. 2 . The German troops at Bagdad have run short of money. 3. There is no more gold in the Hejaz treasure chest at Medina owing to 4,000L in cash having been taken in payment for supplies received from Kassim. Supplies for Medina from Koweit. G.H.Q. Egypt telegraphed [I.A. 2782 i to G.O.C. Force D, on the 23rd December, saying that the King had reported that a caravan containing sugar, rice, petroleum, coffee, and other supplies had been sent in November from Koweit to Hail, and that much of it had reached Medina. This was in addition to the supplies from Qasim, Shakra, and Anaizeh. Administration of Palestine. The French Embassy informed the Foreign Office on the 1 st January that the French Government had decided to take part in the administration of the zone which would be occupied in Palestine if the British should be successful. M. George Picot had been chosen as the French representative. Further, the Minister of War was disposed to consider the question of sending a French contingent to assist the British arms : the contingent would consist of three battalions of Moslem troops from North Africa. asir. In regard to the proposed bestowal of the K.C.I.E. on Idrisi the Besident at Aden telegraphed on the 22 nd December [298 A.P.] saying :— (a.) That the proposed honour was intended not so much as a reward as an incentive to further action. (b.) Idrisi has been consistently anti-Turk, and his attitude has had no small effect on the Imam. He pressed for the return of his gunners who were being trained at Aden, saying that he meant to take action against the Turks, and would send down another batch to be trained. (c.) As regards Ibn-al-Haig, Idrisi did not claim that Haig’s headquarters in Waizat were within his bounds; his lieutenant had for a long time been opposing Haig, but more recently there have been pourparlers with the view of winning him over; he was at present pro-Turk, but was wavering. \d.) Idrisi was naturally aggrieved at outside interference ; Haig was certainly outside the King’s sphere. The Farsan Islands. A difficulty has arisen in regard to these islands, the _ occupation of which by Idrisi was recognised by Great Britain in July last, he, on Ids side, agreeing not to surrender them to any third Power and to apply for assistance to His Majesty’s Government if he should be attacked. In consequence of inquiries made on several occasions by the Italian Ambassador as to whether we were m occupation, the Foreign Office addressed a letter to the India Office on the 18th December asking for information. The India Office replied to this on the 23rd December, and enclosed a draft telegram which Mr. Chamberlain proposed to send to the Indian Government pointing out that the present difficulty had arisen from a failure to carry out previous orders of His Majesty’s Government, and directing that Colonel Jacob should interview Idrisi as soon as possible and explain to him that if it should be found necessary to hoist the British flag on the Farsan Islands this would be done in pursuance of the treaty of the 30th April. The Foreign Office informed the India Office on the 26th December that Mr. Balfour concurred in the draft telegram, which was despatched to the Viceroy on the following day. On the 26th December the Foreign Office informed the Admiralty of the situation, and asked that the Commander-in-chief of the East Indian station should be instructed to hoist the British flag on the islands; the Admiralty sent this order on the same day,4 and three days later, on the 29th, the commanding officer of H.M.S. “ Lunka ” hoisted the British flag on Jebel Katah, as was reported by the Resident at Aden on the SOth December. The naval commander then proceeded to the north island to hoist the flag there, but the Shaykh refused to allow this to be done without written orders from Idrisi [Telegram 304 A. P.]. On the 2 nd January the Resident at Aden telegraphed that the commanding officer of H.M.S. “Lunka” had reported that Idrisi had refused to give him an interview; and that in reply to his written request for a letter to the Farsan Shaykhs had entirely evaded the issue. The commander thereupon informed him that as he would not answer he, the commander, intended to leave at daybreak, and that the responsibility would rest on Idrisi himself. _ The Viceroy had recommended, in a telegram sent on the 26th December, that the British flag should be hoisted by a British ship and a small Indian guard left in posses sion. I he India Office replied on the following day saying that the Admiralty had already instructed a ship to hoist the flag, and that an Indian guard might be left if the admiral agreed. On the 30ih December the Resident at Aden telegraphed that Colonel Jacob was leaving on the 1 st January and would call at Kamaran to pick up an Indian infantry guard, which he would drop at Farsan. .On the 1 st January the Resident telegraphed [305 A.P.] that a military detachment had been landed and the flag hoisted. He recommended that Colonel Jacob should be empowered to with draw this detachment when he visited the islands. There were 100 of Idrisi’s men permanently stationed in Farsan village. * i PART LI. POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. TheG.O.C. telegraphed on the 26th December that it was reported that the closing of the Abyan road was imminent; also that Fadli Sultan had arrived at Lahei on the 25th December,—this was considered to be reliable. t r/i He telegraphed again on the 2 nd January saying that it was estimated that 150 lurks had been transferred from Lahej to Mahatt, and that, according to an unconfirmed report, the bulk of the infantry at Fiyush had also been transferred to i.lahatt. Aushaki was reported to have refused payment of taxes, and fighting was going on Another report (considered to be reliable) stated that two Dankali chiefs were at Shaykh Seid trying to obtain arms, and that they had been promised 90 rifles and 15,000 rounds of ammunition from Moza. Lower Mesopotamia. Hillah. Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 31st December [T. 229] that the wanton severity and treachery which had accompanied the recent Turkish punitive action at Hillah [Arabian Report, N.S.

He further telegraphed on the 1 st January as follows :— Tigris Line. —Reliable information has been received that the Turks in Mesopotamia have been ordered to economise ammunition, and to return empty cartridge- and shell- cases to Ordnance. General. —A message was issued by the Sultan of Turkey to the Turkish troops, m which he stated that, though confident in certain victory, the Turks and Central Powers had imposed the discussion of peace terms for the avoidance of further bloodshed. Ismail Bey. Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 31st December that Ismad Bey the son of the late Ibrahim Pasha, hereditary chief of the Milli Kurds had reached Basra, having escaped from Damascus where he had been imprisoned by the Turks. He had been given a warm reception at Basra. He stated that he was anxious to bring over 150 of his fighting men to take service with us. He had been in command of irregular troops, and Sir P. Cox points out that, apart from possible employment in that way he should be invaluable for intelligence purposes. Ismail had reported that he had stayed with Ibn Shaalan [? who wasj endeavouring to become reconciled with Fahad Ibn Hadhdhal. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. British Prisoners. An agent reports that, on the 8 th November, fifty British prisoneis from Sinaij, who had fallen sick, arrived at Aleppo from Beirut, having previously been at Damascus. When ordered to leave the lorries which had brought them, they presented a pitiful spectacle. Their clothes were in a lamentable state—chests bare, uniforms tom, and one foot dragging after the other. One of them asked a bystander for a cigarette, and was offered T box : a guard snatched the box and, cursing him m Turkish, threw it away. They were all sick from dysentery, brought on by exposure. Ottoman Subjects in Manchester. The following comes from a well-informed source • As you are no doubt aware we have still many Ottoman subjects in Manchester and it is common property in Cottonopolis how quickly and apparently easily rese people receive information respecting internal conditions in enemy countries particular y Turkey. I heard yesterday that a Turk whose offices are m Beaver Street, Manchester, told a cotton salesman that the reason why Germany was so anxious to obtain peace was not because of so-called surface victories but because the mtemal_conditions m the Near East were now reaching a climax, and so bad were things in mi key that a revolution was imminent, and in order to avert the catastrophe the Turkish Mims er had told the German Government that unless peace could be q^ lckl J brought about they themselves would have to throw up the sponge. I give you the above information just as it was related to me. C6 The Bagdad Railway. Information from a reliable source indicates that the railway from Bozanti to Tarsus and from Mamuria to Islahiah is not yet in working order. f Germany and Turkey. An agent reports :— 1 . That Germany has recently sent 1,000 waggons to Turkey for the Bagdad railway. 2 . That Enver Pasha has been to Berlin with Halil Bey, and has mode a commercial treaty with Germany. The Germans declared that they only wished to interfere with Turkey commercially, not from an administrative point of view. They also promised that at the peace conference they would guarantee the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and insist on its right to Egypt. 3. That the Young Turks appeared to be sure that Germany would succeed m making an honourable peace. The accuracy of this information is not guaranteed. Jemal Pasha. An agent reports that he was informed by an official on the 1 st December that Jemal had owing to complications in Constantinople, left that place more than a week previously. Nuri Bey-el-Shalaan. Nuri Bey, an agent writes, was formerly in bad odour with the Turkish Govern ment. Jemal, however, recently wrote him a letter, to which Nuri sent a reply. His messenger was well received by Jemal, who gave him £ T. 100 . Nuri himself then, on the invitation of Jemal, went to Damascus ; there a dinner was given in his honour, he received a present of money, and, with three of his staff, was decorated, Jemal saying that the decorations came from the Sultan. ? For Massacres. An agent reports that all male Turks in Mersina have been provided with a Martini rifle and 200 cartridges each, the reason for which was not known. Dr. Lepsius. i A Dr. Lepsius has been arrested at Potsdam, and is about, it is said, to be tried for high treason for statements made m a lecture on the Armenian massacres which he gave at, Berne. Economic Condition of Constantinople. We learn from a reliable source that the conditions of life in Constantinople are appalling. Though a certain amount of food can be obtained by those who have money to purchase it, the poor are starving. They would like to revolt, but dare not do so as they are m constant dread of machine-guns, and on the least sign of terms ^ ^ &amp; m their ^ Germans and Turks are hardly on speakingAPPENDIX (A). Delations between the Kurds, Ar\b Tribes, and the Turks. A Joint Statement of four Arab Officers. The Kurds .—From time immemorial the Kurds have been hostile to the Turks and recalcitrant to Turkish rule. Except in the towns they never paid any taxes or submitted to military service. When the war broke out the Turks fully realised the importance of propitiating the Kurdish tribes. They knew that if they remained hostile they would be a permanent menace and a peri] to the Turkish armies operating in the Caucasus and in Mesopotamia. Therefore they devised means of binding them up, without apparently interfering with their freedom and secular independence. They played first on their religious susceptibilities. Khalil Bey’s first action on his appointment as Vali of Baghdad, was to proclaim the “ Jehad,” and inaugurate a campaign of denigration against the British and the Bussians, whom he described as the sworn enemies of Islam. He warned the Kurds that the Allies would no more respect the Shia’at than the Sunnat. He brought out the sword of Hussein from Kerbela and the banner of Adi from Nejef, the two most sacred relics to the Kurds, and begged the latter to save these holy relics from profanation and their mosques from destruction; to protect their wives and daughters from dishonour and murder; their homes and lands from devastation. When the Turks saw that fanaticism had reached its climax, knowing from experience that they could not rely on the Kurds, they decided to compromise them irretrievably by using them as their tools for the Armenian massacres. Hereditary hatred, the innate instinct of lust and plunder drove the Kurds heart and soul into the task of annihilating the Armenians. However, reaction came, and the Kurds found, that they had been playing into the hands ot the Young lurks, who m their turn began to lil-tieat the Kurds, knowing that they could not afford any help to the enemy for fear of revenge and renrisals on account of their participation in the Armenian massacres. This is how matters stand at present. The Kurds for months past have been stubbornly opposing the Russian advance in the Caucasus for fear of revenge specially on the part of the Armenians who have enlisted in the Russian army. If an assurance could be given them from responsible quarters, that no harm would befall them, that then lues and properties would be safeguarded, and that the Armenians would not be allowed to play havoc with them, the Kurds would welcome and help the Russians in the Caucasus and the British in Irak. T ™ , , i , Arab Tribes in Irak .—The Arab tribes in Mesopotamia have never peen known to be loval to the Turks, and, what is more, they always professed a very friendly feeling towards EnRand. The present hostile attitude of some of the tribes has come as a surprise to many. The Arab officers attribute this attitude, first of all, to the vigorous anti-British propaganda carried on by the Turco-Germans ; secondly, to the strange policy of the British in conquered territory. Besides representing to the Arabs the calamities of a British ii^asion, with the consequent profanation of the mosques, destruction of homes, abolition of Islam, &amp;c, the Turco-Germans took good care to enhance their propaganda with a show of gold, silver, and all sorts of costly gifts to the Arab chiefs and leaders. At the time when von der Goltz proceeded to Mesopotamia he took with him bags of gold and silver, and rich silk garments for the Arab chiefs With regard to' the British policy in Mesopotamia, the officers believe _ that the British Government did not play up to Arab nationalism as much as it might have done They had expected the British Government to show greater consideration to influential Arabs, specially those who had been known for their sympathies towards England They expected they, would have been given a large share in the admmistra- tion of the country Instead of that they were hardly noticed or even totally Not only the realisation of Arab aspirations, which had been their goal for years, had been deified them, but they had to submit to having imposed upon them Indian officials, Indian institutions, and Indian culture.\ APPENDIX (B). The Pjress, Enemy Propaganda. England and Turkey. [“ Korrespondenz,” 4th November, 1916.] English newspapers frequently recall the fact that Great Britain was once the friepd and protector of Turkey, and seem to consider that England should still hold this position from the point of view of tradition. Turkey, meanwhile, has realised on what a slender basis this English assumption is founded. It is interesting to note that even Japanese newspapers hold this view concerning England’s “ friendship ” for Turkey. In a polemical article directed against the “Manchester Guardian” the “ Yamato bhimun of the middle of August 1916 published the following remarks:— “The ‘Manchester Guardian’ says that England was formerly friendly to Turkey. We really cannot accept this from England ! John Bull’s diplomacy in Tui key was inimical and ignoble, a fact which is perfectly clear to anyone who merely glances at a page of Turkish history. That was also the reason why Turkey became Germany’s ally against England.” ^ hardly necessary to go to Japan to receive a damning indictment of the integrity of England’s policy towards Turkey. The Belgian Ambassador in Berlin, naron Greindl, wrote to his Government as early as the 16th July, 1906, referring to the Anglo-Bussian attempts at reconciliation. According to the ‘ Morning Post,’ England and Russia had planned to agree to the construction of the railway in Mesopotamia (Bagdad railway) on condition at Russia should have the right to connect her Caucasus railway with it and and that England should take control of the new line from Bagdad to the Persian ti q , W - • most outra g eoiIS thing should such an agreement be made, ihe sultan is an independent monarch ; he has given the concession for the railway through Mesopotamia to a German bank. No foreign Power is entitled to interfere or can raise the slightest pretext for meddling in a private matter exclusively concerning Turkey. And yet this plan exists. Lord Lansdowne recently stated in • ^iqoo 1186 ^ f ^ or ^ st hat he had tried m vam to internationalise the Bagdad railway m l 9 °o, and England has attempted from the very beginning to place obstacles in tne way ot this undertaking.

It is very difficult to ™ua a general situation when the information is coloured by the psychological circumstances prevailing at individual points. The Political Effect of the Operations in Sinai. The evacuation of El Arish by the Turks, and the rounding up of the ^11 Turkish force at Maghdaba should have some effect m Syria and Palestine. S^evente^ course cannot be expected to carry much weight with Arabs, unless they have reaso to think we mean 1 business. However, the Turkish political position in Syria is undoubtedly precarious, and if the Turks get it into their heads that there mfnctmn between■ Great Britain and France m regard to Palestine, they mavthin». ^ 8 UM ? to abandon it as an apple of discord, m the same way as they threw up the sponge , Salonika with the object of promoting the second Balkan war. .

This case may give our authorities an opportunity of running to earth an enemy sympathiser and bringing him to book. Turkish Armenian Policy. Attention is drawn to the horrible accounts given by the two Arab officers, eye witnesses of the crimes that have been perpetrated. It is to be noted that both witnesses are Moslems, and gave their evidence in a very calm and unprejudiced manner. The facts recorded by the witnesses tend to confirm all that has hitherto been reported on this subject from more prejudiced sources. Turkish Treatment of British Prisoners of War. Ihe statement of the Sepoy on p. 5 are worth reading; they throw some light on the cruel and deliberate neglect with which the Turks treat our prisoners on the whole. The Turks will probably try to cover this up by additional comforts and special consideration for a few show cases like General Townshend. The Turks are past masters at eating their cake and having it. The chivalrous clean-fighting Turk dies as hard as the Spanish prisoner swindler, who has long survived the late Mr. Labouchere. The Sabaeans. Although it cannot be regarded as a matter of great importance at present, attention is drawn to the account of the Sabaeans or star worshippers of Mesopotamia. In times of peace it will be a part of our task to preserve this most interesting surviving people from extinction. &amp; SH r Turkish Propaganda in the “ Near East/ This newspaper, which contains much useful information, may do harm to our cause bv publishimr articles sueh es f hfi vtiT'irv r]ni.. +l.. a r■ „ x' ^ England at a critical moment.’ ~ V m December 28, 1916.[inis Document is the Property of H is Britannic Majesty’s Government.] Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

He had telegraphed instructions that the evacuation of Habegh was not to take place unless the Turks should arrive in such force as to make the aerodrome position untenable—this in view of the probably disastrous effect on the Arabs and the blow to our prestige. The Question of Military Rely for the King. ^ Sir H. McMahon telegraphed ^No. 1105] on the 23rd December that he had informed Colonel Wilson that, before he communicated the king’s final refusal of military assistance, he wished to he assured by him (the king) in writing, if possible, that he clearly understood and accepted the following points :— (a.) That a European force with its transport could not be maintained indefinitely, and should be transferred, for active employment, to another theatre of operations. (5.) Therefore, if in a later emergency he should apply for European troops, they would not be available. (c.) The Moslem troops for which he had asked were not available. (d.) Though the British operations in Sinai were being rapidly developed, and would have a certain effect on the Turkish dispositions in Hejaz, undue optimism re indulged in. (e.) Henceforward, therefore, the Arab force would be obliged to rely on itself, with such assistance in war material and expert personnel as we might be able to supply. Finally, Sir H. McMahon expressed the earnest hope that the decision not to accept European troops had been well based and not unduly influenced by pro-Turkish and religious elements, whose theory and counsel, if followed to the logical conclusion, might lead to miliary disaster and the collapse of the new Arab kingdom. I he Sirdar telegraphed [No. 93j on the 23rd December that he had received from Jeddah by telegram the summary of a letter addressed to him by King Hussein, who :— (a.) Reiterated his objections to the landing of Christian troops at Rabegh. ( 6 .) Minimised the services an immobile force could render at that place so long as Turkish railway communications were open with Medina. (c.) Could not believe that Great Britain was unable to spare 1,500 Moslem troops from her 5,000,000 soldiers or from those of her Allies. garding the immediate result of those operations must not be dhe Sirdar added that Colonels Wilson and Bremond had gone to Rabegh, and that the latter had recommended his Government to send two battalions of native troops to Rabegh. These troops, with naval assistance and the French troops from Suez could, in Colonel Wilson’s opinion, hold the aerodrome at Rabegh, but not the wells, 4 miles inland. The Sirdar would welcome this, as the evacuation of Rabegh in face of a strong Turkish raid would have a very bad effect on the Arabs. But on the 25th December the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 94xJ that Colonel Bremond had said that he should inform the French Government that a minimum garrison of three battalions, with the French contingent from Suez, was required for the defence of the aerodrome site at R.abegh : but he considered that, unless we were prepared to send a force, the French Government was unlikely to send Senegalese or other troops. Publication of the New Title. The Sirdar telegraphed on tbe- 2 Tth December [No. 92] saying that : (a.) The publication of the recognition of the Sherif as king seemed to be desirable. (b.) He proposed to communicate the fact to the Egyptian press if the Foreign Office concurred. [The “ Daily Express ” of the 22 nd December printed a Reuter telegram stating, on the authority of the u Kibla,” that on the 4th November he was declared Sultan of Arabia.] Colonels Wilson and Parker. Colonel Wilsons staff at Jeddah will be shortly reinforced by the arrival of Captain Bray of the Bengal Lancers, who accompanied the two Indian officers at the time of thepilgrimage. Captain Bray will organise an intelligence system under the direction of Colonel Wilson. Colonel Parker is to be withdrawn from Rabegh, and, until the arrival of the military mission, his work will be carried on by Major Joyce, R.A., who is commanding the Egyptain army escort. ^ Turkish Operations. The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 23rd December [A.B. 473] that, according to aeroplane reconnaissance, the Turks had evacuated Wadi Yen bo and are at present at Bir Was .... [one group undecipherable], Bi Baid, Hamra, and Wasta. ASIR. 1 . The Viceroy telegraphed on the 18th December that the Indian Government :— (a.) Agreed that it was desirable to decorate Idrisi. (b.) Thought a,K.C.I.E more suitable than a K.C.M.G. 2 . The Secretary of State telegraphed on the 18th December that he thought:— (a.) Idrisi’s honour should be postponed because of the difficulty about the Sherif. (b) He should show more activity against the common enemy before being decorated, and this though he sympathised with him in regard to the temporary loss of Comfida. (c.) It seemed desirable that Colonel Jacob should meet him and endeavour to rouse him. (d.) Explanations were required as to why Elheij was claimed us his proper sphere, as his district appeared to be south ot Wadi Ain ; but here again if Idrisi were a more effective ally, it would be easier to consider his susceptibilities. 3 . The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 18th December that he should like to send Colonel Jacob to Jizan(en route to Jeddah), to see Idrisi; he thought the effect of the interview should be good. 4 . The'Resident telegraphed on the 23rd December [299 A.P.] saying that Lieutenant Nalder had arrived on the previous day from Jibut, where he had inter viewed Idrisi. He reported that :— (a.) Some important heads of the Hashid-wa-Bakil were at Jibut in conference with Idrisi. _ _ _ . (b.) Idrisi clearly had no inclination to assist us to establisn fnendiy lelations with the Imam : his policy was to keep us apart. (c.) He said that he would welcome a rapprochement with the Imam on certain conditions—conditions the mere mention of which would widen the breach between them 5 it was patent that he did not desire to befriend the Imam. (d.) He declared his intention to act against Loheiya so soon as his gunners rejoined him; they were being trained in Aden. PART II. POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. 1 . The Resident telegraphed [296 A.P.] on the 20 th December that news haA been received from H.M.S. “Lunka” that the Shaykh of Birk had reported to Idrisi that the Sherif’s men had burnt Comfida and retired. 2 . The G.O.C. telegraphed [920/14] on the 20 th December that the scouts of the 109th Infantry had had a skirmish with the Arabs. 3. The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 22nd December that it was indicated by reports that all troops had been moved out of Lahej to either the Fiyush area or [ ? ]. On the evening of the 21st December there was reciprocal sniping at Jabir and Imad : no casualties.4 Lower Mesopotamia. The 3 rd Echelon Basra telegraphed on the 23rd December that the four French African soldiers who had deserted from the Turks and joined the British forces [_see Arabian Deport N.S. XXI, p. 8 J had, together with another, been sent to India, en route for Egypt, to be handed over to the French authorities. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. A Propagandist Newspaper. The most interesting item in the report of the Arab Bureau for November is that, in accordance with instructions from the Foreign Office, and with the approval of the India Office, an Arabic newspaper entitled the “ Kawkab,” has been started by the Bureau for propagandist purposes in the Persian Gulf, Basra, Zanzibar, Aden, Abyssinia, Somaliland, Sudan, and north-west Africa. It is edited by a well-known Arab leader, Dr. Shabbander, under the management of Mr. G. Brackenbury. The policy of the paper is directed by the Arab Bureau, acting in close concert with Captain Graves and Mr. Brackenbury. It is on a three months trial, and will be continued only if its influence should prove to be useful. Endeavours are being made to obtain articles from the best-known writers in Cairo. Zia Bey. Information has been received that a certain Zia Bey, who arrived in Berne about the middle of this month stated that:— (a.) He was a member of the Turkish Embassy in Berlin. (b.) He was willing to communicate information including ten treaties between Germany and Turkey relating to the holy places, to India, and to Persia. (c.) He wished to make a proposal which would give us some hundreds of thousands of soldiers. (d.) He was acting from admiration of British rule in Mohammadan countries, and did not ask for money. Persons of confidence elicited from Zia that he wished to organise a Moslem confederation against the pan-Islamic movement in Germany, and to put forward the name of Sherif Hussein as Caliph of all Moslems under Great Britain’s protection; and that he being in great need of funds would communicate the text of the treaties in return for cash. The name of this man does not appear in the list of the Berlin corps diplomatique printed in the 1916 edition of the “ Almanac de Gotha.” Condition of Morocco. On the 25th November Mr. White, the British agent at Tangier, transmitted the report of a journey to Fez made by Mr. W. J. Garnett. The main points of interest in this report are :— 1 1. The excellence of the roads in the French zone, in marked contrast with those in the Spanish zone. 2. The cordial relations between the Sultan and the French. 3. The loyal and friendly attitude of the British consular officers. 4. The excellent xelations between General Lvautey and the Spanish Besident— r though their woik has been frustrated by the Spanish Government. 5. The failure of German intrigues among the tribes. 6. The importance of the recent French victory in Eastern Morocco. /. 1 he change in the attitude towards foreigners, who can now visit, without the slightest difficulty, streets and bazaars in Fez which were formerly closed to Christians. J 8. The remarkable development of the country during the present war. General Lyautey told Mr. Garnett that he had received orders, on the outbreak of the war, to evacuate the interior and to withdraw to the coast. These orders were5 absurd, and the best way to obey them had been to remain in the interior. Every vestige of French influence would have disappeared if he had withdrawn. If Morocco had been evacuated the tribes would have attacked Algeria and Tripoli, and Ecrypt might have found itself caught between the Turco-German troops on the one side and j^he successful North African Mohammedan tribes on the other. 1 APPENDIX (A.) Isarrative of a Prisoner who escaped f rom the Turks. Major Rowlandson, liaison officer to the Russian forces, has supplied the following account of the adventures of No. 4874 Sepov Sandagi Ram, 99th Infantry, attached . 6th Punjabis, a Hindu Jat, ol Rohtak district, as told by himself. After the tall of Kut on the 29th April we were marched to a place about 3 miles from Kut with the exception ot the senior officers who were sent by steamer to Baghdad. On the 1st May half of the remaining officers, British and Indian, were sent by steamer to Baghdad, and we received about a quarter of a ration of flour ; up to then we had received no rations since the fall of Kut. On the 2nd May we, the rank and file, British and Indian, started on the march to Baghdad, the remaining officers being left in camp. We were told by a Turkish officer that all the officers were taken to Baghdad by steamer, thence by train to Samarra and thence were given donkeys to ride on and carry their kit, they were all sent to Constantinople. We marched for nine days reacning Baghdad on the 11th May; we did long marches and received no rations en route and many of our men died on the way. I saw no arrangements to convey those that fell out; no boats, or carts, or anything. We existed by selling some of our clothes and by picking grain in the fields which we rubbed in our hands and ale raw. At Bagdad we stayed six days (up to about the 17th May) receiving daily 1 lb. of Turkish bread as rations. At Baghdad I heard that Major Cotton of my regiment had died of disease there. We were then put on board the train and travelled for 35 miles and were then marched for seven days to Mosul, on this march too we received no rations. After a halt of two or three days at Mosul we started to march to Ras-el-Ain. The first march was twenty-four hours long in which we received no water. Thirty-five British soldiers, fourteen Mussulmans, and ten Hindus died of thirst. Their bodies were dragged to the side of the road and left unburied. From Mosul to Ras-el-Ain was eight long marches. From Ras-el-Ain the British and Mussulman prisoners were despatched to Aleppo by train, and the Gurkhas were marched off* for the same place. The other Hindus, including myself, were employed in building the railway from Ras-el-Ain towards Mosul. Between Mosul and Ras-el-Ain we only received rations at two places, and then only 1 lb. of bread at a time. I worked on the railway at Ras-el-Ain for four months, receiving rations every other day. At Ras-el-Ain I saw many bodies ot Armenians lying about—men, women, and children ; some survivors were working on the railway, and they told me that the Russian troops were only four marches away, and pointed out the direction. So Jog Lai—another Jat of my regiment—and I determined to escape. We were employed in parties of ten or twelve men under Kurd sentries. One morning five of us told the Kurds that we wanted to go and bathe, the water was 4 miles away. The Kurds let us go, putting us under Hav. Major Bian Singh of the 76th Punjabis, whom they said they would hold responsible that no one escaped. On arrival at the water, Jog Lai and I told the Hav. Major^ that we wanted to go into the hills close by for the purposes of nature. When out of sight we bolted into the hills. The evening before we had received a ration of parched grain, and had saved it for the escape. We lived on this for five days, hiding by day and marching by night. On the sixth day we went to a village to beg food and were arrested by two policemen, who confined us all day in a house, but at night allowed us to sleep on the roof. When we saw that the policemen had gone to sleep, we quietly climbed down a tree growing alongside the house and escaped into the hills. Some days after we reached a town called “Dinar'’ (?), in Kurdistan, and we entered to beg some food, we were again arrested by a policeman, who took us out of the town into the hills, stripped of all our clothes and the little money we had, flogged us, of which I still bear the marks, and left us. We then made our way to a small [898—22] C6 village close by where the villagers gave us some cloth, which we v rap fed aiound ourselves, but no food, so we returned to Dinar and begged, saymg we were xais an knew no Kurdish. We were then given a meal, but were arrested by a police sergeant as deserters and taken to his house, where he questioned us.^ We s&lt;n we a ere wo Arab brothers, and explained the absence of circumcision by saying that our parents had, died when we were very small, ami we had been beggars since then, and theie oie a never had the rite performed. The Kurds who had fed us insisted that we were poor fakirs and net deserters, and the policeman let us go. The Kurds gave us a lot oi tood, which we eked out for the next five days. We then saw a piquet of troops, and mop up and recognised from the uniform that they were Russians, for I had seen some liussian prisoners at Kas-el-Ain. We then gave ourselves up, saying we were^ English sepoys, and a Kurd who was there knew a little Hindustani and ^ told the Russians w ho we w r ere, and we were then sent to the Russian “ subadar (company or platoon commander?), who gave us some clothes and shoes and a bath, and sent us back to a higher commander, who sent us to Erzerum. Thence I was sent by motor and. train to Tiflis, where a captain in the British service took us over. We stayed there five days. Jog Ed went sick and was admitted to hospital, five Mussulmans and a Hindu hospital follower joined us there, and we seven were then sent to Baku, thence by steamer to Enzeli, and thence by motor car to Kazvin. I would like to return to Kut and fight the Turks again, as they treated me very badly. APPENDIX (B). Armenian Massacres. 1. Report of an Eye-witness, Lieutenant llassan Maarouf. In August 1915 in the suburbs of Mush I saw large numbers of dead bodies of Armenians, men, women, and children lying in the fields. Some had been shot, some stabbed and most of them had been horribly mutilated. The women were mostly naked In the villages around Mush I saw old women and children wandering in the streets, haggard and emaciated. In the same month, in a camp outside Bitlis I saw collected about 500 women, girls and children guarded by gendarmes. I asked the latter what was to become of these people. They said that they were being deported but that they had orders to let the Bauds deal with them on the way. The Bands had been organised by the Turkish Government for the purpose of massacring the Armenians. Tney were formed by Kurds, Turkish gendarmes, and criminals who had been specially set free. On the river at Biths I saw quite a number of bodies of Armenians floating on the water, and some washed up on the banks. The smell was pestilential and the' water undrinkable. In the same month of August in the country at a distance of about two hours from Zaart, I saw the bodies of about 15,000 massacred Armenians. They were piled up on top of each other in two ravines. The Armenian Bishop of Zaart was, at his own request, taken to a cave near by and shot. On my return from Zaart to Mush in a village of the suburbs of Mush over 500 Armenians, mostly women and children, were herded up in a stable and locked in. The gendarmes threw flaming torches, through an opening in the ceiling. They were all burnt alive. I did not go near, but I distinctly saw the flames and heard the'sereams of the poor victims. I heard from reliable persons- that women in the family way had their bodies cut open and the child snatched out and thrown away. At Mush the streets were strewn with bodies of Armenians. Every time an Armenian ventured out of doors he was instantly killed. Even men of great age, blind and invalids were not spared. From Mush to Hinis, at short distances from each other, I saw niles of bodieq of Armenians in the fields alongside the road. Between Sherkes-Koi and Hinis I saw two ravines filled with corpses of Armenians about 400 in each ravine, mostly men. Another ravine was filled with bodies of little children,T) . ^ saw a large number of bodies of Armenians floating on the liiver Murad. When I went to Erzinjian I was told that wholesale massacres were ■ perpetrated at Erzinjian, Mamakhatoun and the whole country round. Besides those that the Bniks had killed and burnt alive they threw thousands of them into the Euphrates, 'large number of Armenians seeing that their death was inevitable, and fear inn worse atrocities preferred to throw themselves into the Euphrates. Report hy an Rye-witness, Lieutenant Sayied Ahmed Moukhtar Baaj. * In April 1915 I was quartered at Erzerum. An order came from Constantinople that Ai menia;is inhabiting the frontier towns and villages should be deported to the interior. It was said then that this was only a precautionary measure. Isaw at that time large convoys of Armenians go through Erzerum. I hey were mostly old men, women, and children. Borne or the able-bodied men had been recruited m the Turkish army, and many had fled to Idussia. Ihe massacres had not begun yet. In May 1915 1 was transferred to Trebizond. In July an order came to deport to the interior all the Armenians in the vilayet of Trebizond. Being a member of the court martial I knew that deportation meant massacre. The Armenian Bishop of Trebizond was ordered to proceed under escort to Erzerum to answer for charges trumped up against him. But instead of Erzerum he was taken to Baipurt, and from there to Ouimush-Khana. The governor of the latter place was then Colonel Abdul-Kader Aintabli, of the general staff. He is famous for his atrocities against the Armenians. He had the bishop murdered at night. The Bishop of Erzerourn was also murdered at Gumush-Khana. Besides the deportation order referred to above, an imperial c&lt; Iradeh ” was issued ordering that all deserters, when caught, should be shot without trial. The secret order read “Armenians” in lieu of “deserters.” The Sultan’s “Iradeh” was accompanied by a “ fetua ” from the Sheikh-ul-Islam stating that the Armenians had shed Moslem blood, and the killing of them was lawful. Then the deportations started. 1 he children were kept back at first. The Government opened up a school for grown-up children, and the American consul at Trebizond instituted an asylum for nfants. When the first batches of deported Armenians arrived at Gumush-Khana all able-bodied menw ere sorted out with the excuse that they were going to be given work. The women and children were sent- ahead under escort with the assurance by the Turkish authorities that their final destination was Mosul, and that no harm would befall them. The men kept behind, were taken out of town in batches of fifteen or twenty, lined up on the edge of ditches prepared beforehand, shot and thrown into the ditches. Hundreds of men were shot every day in a similar manner. The women and children were attacked on their way by the “Shotas,” the armed bands organised by the Turkish Government, who attacked them and seized a certain number. After plundering and committing the most dastardly outrages on the women and children they massacred them in cold bio d. These attacks were a daily occurrence until every woman and child had been got rid of. The military escorts had strict ordets not to interfere with the “ Shotas.” The children that the Government had taken in charge were also deported and massacred. The infants in the care of the American consul at Trebizond were taken away with the pretext that they were going to be sent to Sivas, where an asylum had been prepared for them. They were taken out to sea in little boats. At some distance out they were stabbed to death, put in sacks, and thrown into the sea. A few days later- some of their little bodies were washed up on the shore at Trebizond. In July 1915 I was ordered to accompany a convoy of deported Armenians. It was the last batch from Trebizond. There were in the convoy 120 men, 700 children, and about 400 women. From Trebizond I took them to Gumish-Khana. Here the 120 men were taken away and, as 1 was informed later, they were all killed. At Gumish-Khana I was ordered to take the women and children to Erzinjian. On the way I saw thousands of bodies of Armenians unburied. Several bands of “Shotas” met us on the way and wanted me to hand over to them women and children. But I persistently refused. I did leave on the way about 200 children with Moslem families, who were willing to take care of them and educate them. The “ Mutessarrif ” of Erzinjian ordered me to proceed with the convoy to Kamach. At the latter place the authorities refused to take charge oi the women and children. I fell ill and wanted to go back, but I was told that as long as the Armenians in my charge were alive I should be sent from one place to the other. However, I managed to include my Patch withthe deported Armenians that had come from Erzerum. In charge of the latter was a colleague of mine, Mohamed Effendi, from the gendarmerie. He told me afterwards that after leaving Kamach they came to a valley where the Euphrates ran. A band of ‘'Shotas” sprang.out and stopped the convoy. They ordered the escort to keep away, and then shot every one of the Armenians and threw them in the river. At Trebizond the Moslems were warned that if they sheltered Armenians th(^ would be liable to the death penalty. Government officials at Trebizond picked up some of the prettiest Armenian women of the best families. After committing the worst outrages on them they had them killed. Cases of rape of women and ffirls, even publicly, are very numerous. They w'ere systematically murdered after the outrage. iho Armenians deported from Erzerum started with their cattle and whatever possessions they could carry. When they reached Erzmjiau they became suspicious, seeing that all the Armenians had already been deported. The Yali of Erzerum allayed their fears, and assured them most solemnly that no harm would befall them. He told them that the first convoy should leave for Kamach, the others remaining at Erzerum until they received word from their friends informing of their safe arrival to destination. And so it happened. Word came*that the first batch had arrived safely at Kamach, which was true enough. But the men were kept at Kamach and shot, and the womeipand children were massacred by the “ Shotas after leaving that town/ Ihe Turkish officials in charge of the deportation and exterminate n of the Armemans were: At Erzerum, Bihaa Eddin Shaker Bey; at Trebizond, Naiil Bey, iewfik Bey Monastirly, colonel of gendarmerie, the commissioner of police; at Kamach ? the member of Parliament for Erzinjian. Hie Shotas’ headquarters were also at Kamach! I ieir chief was the Kurd Murza Bey, wffio boasted that he alone had killed 70,000 Armenians. Afterwards he w^as thought to be dangerous by the Turks and thrown into prison charged with having hit a gendarme. He was eventually executed in secret. APPENDIX (C). -luo -t±iuu Movement.

' J an&lt; ^ I ra k the Christians and Jews should have exactly the same privileges as the Mohammedans, and absolute equality of rights. APPENDIX (D). The Star Worshippers of Mesopotamia. (By the Beverend J. van Ess.) A curious phenomenon exists in Mesopotamia in the form of a mass of people who have borrowed from all the races about them, and have adopted customs belonging to all, and yet who are totally isolated from them socially. Ihese are the Sabeans, known to some as the “ Star Worshippers of Mesopotamia.” Some writers have referred to them as “ Saint John Christians,” but this is a misnomer, because the “ John ” to whom they profess to adhere is certainly not a saint, nor are they Christians in any sense of the word. They are the Sabeans mentioned in the Book of Job, though not the Sabeans snentioned in the Koran. During the time of the Mohammedan supremacy, however, they have accepted the interpretation that they are the Sabeans mentioned in the Koran, in order thus to protect themselves against persecution, since the Sabeans are mentioned in the Koran along with Christians and Jews as “people of the Book,” and therefore to be reverenced. The scientific name of these people is the Mandaeans. The word “ Mandaean” in their own language means disciple, and they refer to themselves as the disciples of John. Their language is Mandaitic, which belongs to the Semitic group of languages, and is a first cousin of Syriac. No printed literature exists, although a few of their manuscripts are in the hands of European scholars. The foremost Mandaitic scholar was Peterman, a German orientalist, who about sixty years ago spent two years among the Sabeans at Suk-esh- Sheyukh. Ihey, of course, also speak Arabic, though never to my knowledge have they attended any Arabic schools. In the seventeenth century they numbered about 20,000 families, but at the present day their total does not exceed 3,000 souls. They exist onty in Mesopotamia, a few living in Baghdad, and by far the great majority around Suk-esh-Sheyukh. They are always to be found on running water, inasmuch as the tenets of their religion demand their proximity to living water. This great decrease in population is due first of all to the persecution from the Mohammedans and then to internal strife ; further, many of their women have in late years been married to Mohammedans, and thus the race is fast disappearing. Their occupation is, in the main, that of silversmiths, making of a peculiar canoe called the “ Mashoof,” and dairying. Their silverwork is justly famous for exquisite workmanship It consists of black and silver, wrought in cunning designs. The composition of this black substance, supposed to be antimony, is a secret of the trade with them. Of late years Arabs have been more tolerant towards them because of their ability as smiths and boat-builders, in neither of which occupations has the Arab any skill. Their religion is a curious mixture of old Babylonian Paganism, of Judaism, of Christianity, and Mohammedanism. From the Jewish religion they have borrowed sacrifices and purifications; from the Christian religion they have borrowed the observance of the first day of the week. Baptism, the Lord’s Supper, and the reverence for John the Baptist; and from the Mohammedan religion they have borrowed polygamy. Their great book is called the Sidra Babba, which contains their doctrines in rather fragmentary form, and which gives evidence of a variety of authors, and, in consequence, a great number of contradictions. Even a glimpse of this book is very difficult to obtain, although many demands have been made to secure a copy thereof. Some years ago, some travellers succeeded in stealing a copy, but representations were made to the consul, and the book was returned to them. I understand that a copy exists in the [898—22] D10 British Museum, together with a poor Latin translation which has completed. In 1904, through the friendship with ^ c ef pi lest . va j purchase a copy for the sum of twelve po»^. ^’L^r^mon^trution should never sell the same. Even then, the nex ay , r 0 ®hare m e return the by all the Sabeans, and earnest endeavours were mac e ^ th® h feature 0 fl^ booh. The book in question is now bemg translated m- laced over this book is that half of each page is reversed to allow ot the «&gt;C£K w g i sid „. narrow channel of running water, and to be rea thir d s c/which consists of Another of their books ,s the “Book of Souls, ot&gt; ' ^ ^ prayers for the living and one-third of prayers or t e i ca . ‘‘ i , history of the death of Adam, who, to them, is one of the great pro - marriage A third book contains the liturgy for the priests, and oth f ® for ceremony, the life of John the Baptist, a treatise of astrology, and various lot mu Their belief is that the world originated from what is called a ^ something like the Orphean theory of the world egg and that the gieal W Iwo » forth life from this great egg, from which life again emanated a-ther hfr who was Jesus Christ, but that the latter endeavoured to usurp the power of the f°™er a” was therefore placed among the planets as Mercury They believe ^ the h ®y® consist of the purest water, so hard that not a diamond can cut it, in which Ao a heavenly bodies as well as this earth. They also believe that the earth is surrounded on three sides by seas, but on the fourth there is a turquoise mountain the reflection from which gives the blue colour to the sky. They also believe that the Queen of Darkness married Fire, and brought forth 24 sons of whom 7 were the planets, including the sun, 12 were the signs of the zodiac, and the remaining o are not know These planets are sources of evil and of curse to mankind The 1 ole Stai is situated at the very dome of heaven, and therefore they pray toward it, and for this reason they are called the “ star-worshippers. . . , a j They practice Baptism, which by the pious among them is received every bunday ; they also observe a sort of supper, which apparently is an imitation of the Christian Communion. . . They have places of worship, which, however, are only large enough to contain two or three priests, and through these places of worship run tiny streams of water oyer which prayers are said. There is no furniture in their churches, save a shelf on which books and other articles are kept. Their priesthood is open to both men and women. The first grade is that of the novice, after which the grade of priest, thereafter a bishop, and the highest official of the church is the chief priest. The present chief priest is named Shaykh Mahi, and resides at Suk-esh-Sheyukh. No priest may have the slightest blemish in his body, and the consequence is that the chief priest is one Optfie most striking fiomres 1 have ever seen anywhere. Even women may attain to the rank of priesthood, but only on the condition that they marry a priest. It is against their reliodon for them to' wear dark clothes, and for their women to wear anything blue. ^ _ ^ One wonders how this curious growth will fare in the new 7 soil of British adminis tration. They are unquestionably pro-British-, for the reason that they have always been anti-Turkish. , . , ,, They never cut their hair, and both men and women may be called decidedly handsome ; in fact, so handsome, that a Sabean can be at once recognised. They were taken into the army by the Turks, but were again excused, because of the utter impossibility of meeting any of their religious, demands with respect to being always near running water. APPENDIX (E). Feom the Press. Arabs and Turks. (From the “ Kibla,” No. 25, Moharrem 15, 1335.) The Indian newspaper “Mashreq” published an article from the pen of a very influential Indian, Mawloi Abdul-Aziz Ornek Ahady, which we have pleasure in translating in full for the benefit of our readersI beg to say, first of all, that I have no connection whatever with the British Government. I am not in its service and do not hold any position under it. From the day that the Sherif started the movement in Hejaz I have intended to express my opinion publicly, but I have had to postpone doing so on account of my time being limited, and also on account of Ramadan. I say now that we Moslems must let our ^intellect guide us and our thoughts rule our actions in this grave matter, in order that we should avoid partiality and follow the right path. We must always adopt the truth. . It is a well-known fact that the Ka’aba is the sanctuary of every Moslem. It is our belief that the sun of Islam will dawn ultimately upon the plains which weie uhe first to see it rise. The holy revolt bears witness to this. There is not a country m the Islamic world like the Hejaz, whose ulemas and notables are the fittest’ co gi\ e an opinion in this matter. . Therefore it is our duty to consult them regarding the e\ents taking place in their country, and enquire &lt;&gt;f them whether they approve. ^ I can but think°that they have given their consent and that they are the supporters of the revolt. , We firmly believe and witness before God and all men that the Fmir^and Sneni or | Holy Mecca is one of the greatest-ulemas and a leader of Islam. God forbid that he j should commit an action that is not in accordance with Shariaat or contrary to the i evident truth. _ .. . The caliphate or leadership can be obtained in three ways; hirst, by election resulting from the unanimous proclamation by Moslems like that of Abu- tj.iki ; secondly, by succession, as in the case of Omar Ibn Khattab; thirdly, by authority em power like the Amawis and Abbasides. They were all Arabs from Koreish, and to all of them could be adapted the words of the Prophet: “ The leadership wnl remain m sli ^ The Turks do not possess any of the above-mentioned qualifications, therefore the Sherif of Mecca is lawfully entitled to the caliphate, and not the Turkish sultan. ^ The supposition of some Indian Moslems that this revolt was engineered _ by Christian Powers who will eventually interfere with affairs in Hejaz has no foundation, and it is a crime before God to harbour such a thought. The people of the Hejaz who have undertaken this revolt are more firm in their faith than those woo^ entertain doubts, and more vigilant over the preservation of Islam. They will never allow any interference by the English or others. . . „ Tell me, oh reader, what is the advantage that Christians can expect irom occupying a barren land and a country that cannot bring any material oeneht It Christians had any evil intentions with regard to those places they would have acred at the time the Turks proclaimed a Holy War in obedience to the Germans and for the latter’s benefit. But the Allies never gave a thought to an attack in Hejaz, and thus proved that they had no religious hatred. ^ Besides, if our brothers from Hejaz had asked the British Government to sen them Christian troops we should have had grounds to suspect them, but as Jong as Moslem troops are fighting we have no reason to blame them. If^ someone says that the Moslem soldiers do not know how to manipulate guns, we should not take the slightest 'notice of him ; the courage and heroism of the Arabs are too well known. Others may say that the Arabs are incapable of organising a Government^ ot mstitu mg a political administration, and introducing civilisation and progress m He]az^on account of their lack of experience in great undertakings. We will ask them : Whaw good lave the Turks ever done in the Holy Places ? And we will add that the existence of a oreat leader of the Arabs like the actual Sherif is a guarantee for the realisation o their vital aims and the assurance of security. The Arabs are not traitors ; they wu e loyal to their Emir. . . . i We Moslems of India, must stand compact, and entertain one opinion only with regard to this great Moslem event. In order to attain this aim we must convoke at Bombay a meeting of the Mohammedan leaders in India and the Arabs inhmtmg tms country. This assembly will, in the name of the Moslem Indians send a warning to the Turkish Government, through a neutral Power, asking it to grant Heiaz full independence under the rule of the Sherif, If Turkey refuses, the Moslem Indians will protest vigorously and will help the Arabs to drive the Turks out ot the Holy Pla ° Another suggestion is that a mission of Indian ulemas, notables, and prominent personalities should proceed to Hejaz and assemble ' n *q he f ^Alrm can Sherif, in order to discuss matters relating to Islam and the Moslems. come of this to any of the Powers.

In Smyrna the life is monotonous, and the absence of letters and newspapers from the allied countries is most discomforting, but English and French residents are well treated.

Dr. Alois Musil, a professor in the university of Vienna, has published a paper in the “ Balkan u. Naher Orient ” on Arabic and the Arabs in the history of the world which is worth reading. Enemy Propaganda. The Sultan Abbas Hilmi has sent a message to General Sir Francis Wingate expressing gratitude for the eminent services he has rendered to Egypt, in the course of which he says :— “ Thanks to you, the Egyptian army has attained its present perfection, and not only is the Soudan definitely pacified, but the ancient frontiers have been restored by the retaking of Darfur. In public recognition thereof it pleases me to confer upon you the Grand Cordon of Mohamed Ali.” The Sultan has conferred the same Order on the Egyptian Premier.— Reuter.

Military Situation in Hejaz. THE situation in Hejaz will be most readily understood by a study of the attached map, which is marked up to date for the 20th December. The following is an appreciation of the situation shown on the map supplied from an authentic source :— 1 . The yellow line indicates the distribution of the Turkish force on the 10 th December, 1916. It marks the maximum dispersion, and most southerly advance of the force, on a front measuring L15 miles from Khudairah to Bir-el-Azm. The dispersion of the force on this front might have been intended—• (a.) To cover a large concentration at Medina ; or (b.) To enable the force to live on the country. We know that the Turks in this theatre are short of supplies, and that the conditions of the Hejaz Railway is not such as to allow of a large concentration at Medina. The recent Turkish movements can therefore be safely explained on the basis of (b) above. 2 . On the 18th December, 1916, the Turkish forces had closed in, within the green triangle Bir Said-Ghair—Bir Darwish. This may be a preliminary to either of the following operations - (a.) A concentration with a view to an advance on Mecca. (b.) Withdrawal by rail to another theatre. (c.) A return to the original dispositions of the force, closely covering Medina. With reference to the above alternatives (a.) An advance on Mecca or Rabegh is apparently not intended, as we have definite information that the Turkish forces on the Sultani and Eari roads have retired some 10 miles in each case. (b.) and (c.) The withdrawal of the entire force need hardly be considered as a possibility, in view of the great loss of prestige which the Turks would suffer should they give up Medina, after losing Mecca. On the other hand,, the withdrawal of a large portion of the force to another theatre can be readily accounted for, both by the danger which is threatening the Turks elsewhere, and by the increasing difficulty of the supply question at Medina. N.B.—To explain the full meaning of the map and the appreciation the following extract from the Arab Bulletin No. 32 is here reprinted. It gives an intimate account of the faults, limitations, and merits of the Sherif’s forces :— [898—2112 With the exception of the Bishawi retainers and the “ soldiers ” at Babegh tl|ese forces are entirely tribal. About 10 per cent, are Camel Corps and the rest infantry some of whom are desert tribes and some hill tribes. I did not see much (or think much) of the desert tribes, but the hillmen struck me as good material for guerilla warfare They are hard and fit, very active, independent, cheerful snipers. _ They will serve only under their tribal sheikhs and only in their home district, or near it. T ley have suspended their blood feuds for the period of the war, and will fight side by side with their old blood enemies if they have a Sherd in supreme command ; except exceptional circumstances they wonld not, I think, obey the orders ° to any other tribe. The lack of disciphne-or, rather, of control—allows them to go home and see their wives and families when they please, if they produce a substitute The personnel of the army thus changes incessantly; this is inevitable m tubal 'VVcLI*i?£lI*G • • There is a sheikh usually to every hundred or so men. He is paid their wages, and is resoonsible for their being fed and ready for action m their stated strength when called upon. . . p f-n Tactics .—The tribal armies are aggregations of snipers only. Before this war they had slow, old muskets, arid they have not yet appreciated fully the uses of a magazine rifle. They would not use bayonets, but enjoy cutting with swords. No man quite trusts his neighbour, though each is usually quite whole-hearted in his opposition to the Turks. This would not prevent him working off a family grudge by letting down his private enemy. In consequence, they are not to be relied on for attack in mass. Ih e y are extremely mobile, and will climb or run a great distance to be in a safe place for a shot—preferably at not more than 300 yards range, though they are beginning to use their sivhts empirically. They shoot well at short ranges, and do not expend much ammunition when in contact with the enemy, though there is any amount of joy-firing at home. Feisal gives them fifty cartridges each, keeps a tight hold of his reserves, and prevents waste as far as possible. The Arabs have a living terror of the unknown. This includes at present aeroplanes and artillery. The sound of the discharge of a cannon- sends every man within earshot to cover. They are not afraid of bullets, or of being killed -it is just the manner of death by artillery that they cannot stand. They think guns much more destructive than they really are, but their moral confidence is probably as easily restored as it is easily shaken. A few guns—useiul or useless—on their side would encourage them to endure the Turkish artillery, and, once they get to know it, most of their terror will pass. At present they fight only at night, so that the Turkish guns shall be blind. Political Situation in Hejaz. The political situation in Hejaz is dominated by King Hussein’s vacillation between begging for European troops and then going back on his request. This is easily under standable, the King knows that once European troops are landed that his prestige is gone, and that the Arabs will probably join the Turks ; on the other hand, he knows that unaided his army cannot keep the Turks out of Mecca if they have enough transport and supplies to carry them thither. Consequently, when Pie Turks seem likely to advance King Hussein asks for troops, when they retire he thinks better of it. European troops in Hejaz are a last resource. If it were possible to collect a Moslem force of infantry 4,000 strong, with European officers, it would, relieve permanently a•; asasa 3 dangerous a nd distracting situation which has vexed us for the last four months and unless attended to will probably endure to the end of the war. Decorations for King Hussein and Idris. . ^ submitted that, in the case of Idris, the decoration should be dependent on action, and in the case of King Hussein delayed until we have made his position secure. *S Central Islamic Society.

The Sirdar telegraphed on the 13th December [No. 79] that Major Joyce had reported from Rabegh that All’s force, having been equipped as far as possible, was about to take the field. It consisted of about 1,800 so-called regulars, 6,000 Bedouins, 4 howitzers, a field gun, 7 mountain guns, and 15 Maxims. ^ Ali was confident that this force could withstand regular troops. Major Joyce did not agree. Captain Lawrence had reported that Faisai s position had changed from that of a leader of the tribes to a tribal leader. After handing over the guns to the Arabs, the Egyptian detachments with Faisal’s force would withdraw to Rabegh, where the bulk of Egyptian. [898—21] B2 detachments in Hejaz will then be concentrated. W^hen this is^done, and when Alls force has gone, the garrison of Habegh will consist of about 900 ligyptian infantry and gunners, and possibly 700 Arab irregulars, there was no news of Abdullas force. The Arab Bureau telegraphed [A.B. 404] on the 13th December that there was no^ indication that the Turks were preparing to advance on Rabegh, and that the Navy hack reported that Yambo was able to withstand an attack. There had been no news of Abdulla since the 8 th December, when it was reported at Mecca that he was making for the Hanakiyah, north-east of Medina, to intercept convoys of supplies coming from central Arabia. On the 14th December the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 81] that it had been reported by an aerial reconnaissance from Rabegh, on the 11 th December, that there were twenty to thirty [group undecipherable] at Adhab and five at Ghayer, but between Adhab and Rabegh all was clear, except for some small Bedawin encampments. He added that Colonel Bremond and Captain Lloyd had just arrived. Having discussed the situation with these two officers, he sent on the same day [No. 83] along telegram, of which what follows is the gist: ( 1 ) The efforts made to train and organise an Arab force had been unsuccessful, mainly owing to the ignorance and inertness of the Arab leaders; ( 2 ) from a purely military point of view there appeared to be no serious obstacle to a Turkish force penetrating to Mecca; (3) the moral effect in a crisis of landing regular troops in Hejaz would be very great, as it would give the Arab forces a rallying point and stimulate them to action against detached bodies and communications; (4) he could see no other way of assisting the Arabs and saving the movement from collapse; (5) though the Sherif had cancelled his application for European troops, he was genuinely alarmed, and, in Colonel Bremond’s opinion, with a little pressure would ask for them again; ( 6 ) the immediate question for His Majesty’s Government was whether a last attempt should be made to save the Sherif and his Arabs in spite of themselves; in his own opinion, the troops should be sent at once, and as he agreed with Colonel Bremond that the force suggested should be increased by two battalions of infantry, he begged that the French Government might be asked to send to Rabegh either the two Senegalese battalions who were at Jibuti or some similar force. In reply to this the Foreign Office telegraphed [No. 45], on the 15th December, that the Sirdar had the authority of His Majesty’s Government to send a British brigade and the French contingent, if he was satisfied as to the conditions maintained in earlier telegrams, and if transport could be arranged. He was also authorised to inform the Sherif that the Sinai offensive would take place almost immediately, and that this should render material assistance to him, especially if he could induce the Arab tribes in southern Palestine to rise against the Turks. At the same time, the telegram said that it was fully realised that, should the Sherif s movement collapse, the responsibility would rest with him owing to his refusal of assistance for which he had asked and which we were prepared to send. On receipt of this the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 86 ] on the 16th December that he had received from the Sherif further messages, asking that European troops should not be sent to Rabegh, but detained at Port Sudan or Suez. The Sherif had expressed to Colonel Wilson grave apprehensions of the effect of the landing of Christian troops on the attitude of the Arabs and on his own prestige. He asked that two Moslem battalions might be sent to Rabegh, and urged the desirability of a British landing at Akaba as an alternative to Rabegh. It was not likely that he would consent to the landing of Christian troops at Rabegh before the crisis actually arose, when it would be too late. Unless the proposals made in his telegram No. 83 should be approved, the Sirdar proposed to inform the Sherif that troops and transports could not be detained immobile, and that he must decide whether he wished a European force to be landed at Rabegh in the course of the next fortnight; should he decide in the negative, he must understand that his refusal would be regarded as final. The Sirdar concluded by saying that, though it seemed to him to be very small, there was always the chance that nervousness regarding their communications, coupled with the lack of initiative, might deter the Turks from undertaking an offensive in sufficient force to overwhelm the Arab lines. . 15th December the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 84] that a seaplane recon naissance on the 11 th December had located a Turkish force at Nakhl Mubarak in a position to watch the approaches to Yambo ; its strength was not stated. Faisal had repotted to the Sherif that the Turks intended to attack Yambo with an overwhelming foice , his position was critical, and he begged that British assistance might be sent to him “ within two days.” 5On the 18th December the Arab Bureau telegraphed [A.B. 438] that since 12 th instant following news had been received Yambo Area. —Turks have evacuated Nakhl Mubarek, and said to be retiring in direction of Hamra. Turkish mounted patrol penetrated to Kheif Hussein, but retired (one group) Shaatha before Juheinah, who appear? once more to have plucked up spirit. Yambo defences are proceeding steadily, but morale is still poor. Unlikely there will be immediate attack. Strong reconnaissance being sent by Faisal to Nagneshl Maberek, and he intends going inland in person on 16th. Aeroplane reconnaissance showed 50 men at Bir Said, and several bodies of men, amounting to about 1 , 200 , in district, all moving east. Darb-el-Sultani Area. —Sherif Ali and Aziz-el-Masri, who has been given wide power, are between Bir-ibn-Hussani and Masturah with 1,800 trained troops and 6,000 Arabs. They intend to make their forward base at Bir-ibn-Hussani, and to occupy with mixed force hills north of Bedr-Honein. Turks are said to have retired to Hambra from Easta. Subh are holding Shafia and Meliff. Darb-el-Fura. —Turks have not advanced south of Ghayer. Bahalah said to have looted 400 camels at Bir-Derwish. Eastern Road. —Beported that Abdulla is making for Sabiyah and not Hanakiyah. Situation on the whole is slightly easier. Indication that Turks are feeling strain on their infantry, whose bread rations have been reduced by half. As yet there are no signs of an advance on Babegh. Turkish Forces. —Beported by two doctor deserters that there are 3,000 troops, mostly Turks, at Maan. One mixed battalion of Turks, Arabs, Kurds, and Circassians at Akaba, 1,500 Turks and Arabs at Tevuk with several German officers, and one battalion at Medn Saleh whose composition is unknown. Meeting with King Hussein. The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 81] on the 14tb December that the Sherif was at Jeddah on the 10 th December, 'when he received, in a most friendly way, the British and French representatives, whom he asked.to visit him at Taif. Colonels Wilson and Bremond handed him identical replies to his proclamation. Later in the day he received them again and explained his revolt in a long speech. He declared that he only desiied to liberate his countrymen and attached no importance to titles. At 9 p.m. he handed to Colonel Wilson a written request for the despatch of European troops, which he withdrew next morning. French Assistance. Lord Bertie telegraphed on the 13th December [No. 1340] that, as soon as it had learnt the decision of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Babegh (as described m telegram 36 to the Sirdar), the French Government had instructed Colonel Bremond to send the French units at Suez to Babegh to assist the British forces. The Title. The Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Viceroy [P. 5235] on the 13th December informing him that Flis Majesty's Government had decided on Malik-el- Heiaz with the honorific style Siyada. The Foreign Office telegraphed to the Sirdar on the 12 th December [Mo. 39] that, if necessary, Cffionel Wilson might explain to the Sherif that the agreement between him and His Majesty’s Government will not be affected by the use of the somewhat narrow designation of “ Malik-el-Hejaz.” And on the 15th December the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 85] that Colonel Wilson had informed the Sherif personally of the decision of His Majesty’s Government. More Arab Prisoners for King Hussein. On the 16th December Colonel Blair telegraphed to D.M.I. [No. 827] saying that there were some more Turkish officers—prisoners in Bussia—ot Arabian nationality who wished to join the Arabian army, and asking whether they might be sent to ^On the 19th December D.M.I. replied that these officers might be sent, provided that it was certain that they were of Arab nationality.4 Suggested Conferences. As was noted in Arabian Eeport N.S. XXI, it has been suggested that there should be a conference between the Sirdar, the Resident at Aden, and Sir Percy Cox before the first named entered on his duties as High Commissioner of Egypt. But on the*^ 15th December the G.O.C. at Basra telegraphed [LG. 4195] that the absence of Sif Percy Cox would not be very convenient; he was then with the G.O.C. on the Tigris front, but could leave Basra for Maskat on the 25th December. Two days later the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 88 ] that he had received a copy of the G.O.CVs telegram, and that in view of the crisis in Dejaz and the obvious inconvenience of Sir P. Cox being absent from his headquarters, he was of opinion that the meeting should be postponed, and that therefore he should leave Khartum on the 18th December, and arrive in Cairc on the 27th. But on the 19th December the Sirdar replied to a telegram received from Aden, saying that he thought a meeting between Colonels Jacob and Wilson most desirable. The Arab Prisoners from India. The Viceroy, answering a telegram of the 27th November, telegraphed on the 14th December that a full enquiry in regard to the Arab prisoners who were sent tc Rabegh had elicited the fact that they were not informed of their intended destination before starting. The only possible explanation of what could be only conjecture was that last summer two Arab officers were permitted to choose from among tin prisoners, for service with the Sherif, men whom they considered would be likely to consent; a certain number of these first agreed to the proposal and later retracted. Probably, therefore, some knowledge of that scheme leaked out through these men and, on orders being received to transfer all Arabs from Sumerpur, gave rise to suspicion which, when they found themselves under orders to embark, developed the idea in their mind that they were probably being sent to join the Sherif. Troublesome Indians at Jeddah. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 1079] on the 12 th December that the presence at Jeddah of four Indians who were strongly pro-Turkish and dangerous had been reported by Colonel Wilson. Three of them had been for several years in Hejaz, but one only came last year. Their deportation to India was strongly urged by Colonel Wilson, and he concurred in the recommendation. He asked whether the Government of India objected. IDRISI OF ASIR. Suggested Knighthood. The Sirdar telegraphed [No 91] on the 19th December that he agreed with the proposal, but as it might not accentuate the feeling between the Sherif and Idrisi, he suggested that a G.C.M.G. should be offered to the former, before he heard anything about the intended reward for Idrisi; though possibly he might prefer not to accept, in view of the handle it would give to Turkish propaganda. PART II. POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 13th December [920/8] that it was estimated that since the 21 st November the Arab irregulars with Said Pasha had decreased in number by 250 ; and on the following day j 920/9], referring to his telegram of the 6 th December, he telegraphed that reports indicated that early in December a force of about 200 Turks and Somalis had been sent to the Subaihi country and afterwards recalled. On the 15th December the G.O.C. telegraphed [920/10] it was reported that- - 5 w e tTonsllIdt™abli retUrned t0 MaVk ° n th6 1Uh DeCember - The re P° rte -ksent acoDvIfthP W 6 ^* 283 V' [A ^ ab f n E , e P ort ’ N - S - XXI, p. 7 |, General Barrow ^and of th ^ r ? ffi ° e a ? d enc L mred “ whether, in view of this communication Be ; r ?!l,Wi P + Spe0t 0 -j tl ' 0 T bem ?

Ismail] Bflfendi was to be sent to collect revenue in the Fadli country. 11 this should be true, it would reallymean an attempt to control or stop Abyan trade Lower Mesopotamia. The G.O.C. Force L) telegraphed on the 13th December saying that in regard to exports from the Euphrates, the latest news was that Rashid Inn Laila, an agent of Ibn Kashici, with a caravan of flour and rice for Hail, had been stopped and his goods had been seized by the inhabitants of Mashha Ali Najaf. At Basra, Zubair, and Khamisiyah we have our own preventive measures, Ibn Saud and the Shaykhs of Koweyt, Balnem, v^)uai/ai, and the iruciai Coast have been warned repeatedly, and political officers are using their utmost endeavours, in co-operation with the Shaykhs, to keep a check on export to interior, and restrict to authorised places and persons, but it is impossible entnely t &gt; ensure against deflection of goods after reaching the interior. I should be glad to have all the detads obtainable as to the nature, precise source, and extent of the supplies reaching Medina. The C.P.O. at Basra telegraphed on the 12 th December that Dhari Ibn Tawalah had received, through a Shammar messenger, an unsigned letter which purported to come from Saud Ibn Suohan, and was believed to be genuine. The Ottoman Government, according to the letter, alarmed by the Sherif’s success, had sent Ibn Lailah, Ibn Rashid’s agent in Constantinople, to get Shammar help for the siege of Taif. No tribesmen being found in Hail, Ibn Lailah proceeded to Iraq to raise the Mesopotamian Shammar. Dhari Ibn lawalah reported that the Shammar Shaykhs of Sinjarah and Turnan at Subaika, two days south of Najaf, were in close correspondence with him, and desirous of coming in. It was further reported that, with the object of buying horses and provisions for Ibn Rashid, Ibn Lailah had reached Najaf, and that he intended to attack the Sherif. The local tribes refused to allow the caravan to pass, and any movement against the Sherif was delayed, Ibn Lailah being held up at Najaf. If attacked by the Turks the people of that place are said to be determined to resist. Kaevihim Yazdi, the principal Sayid of Najaf, was reported to be preaching a Jehad against the Turks. The same Shammar messenger reported that it, was Ibn Subhan’s intention to murder Ibn Rashid and then take his place under our protection. The messenger saw the A.P.O. at Zubair, &gt; who held out no hope of connivance at murder. He left before the answer of the C.P.O. could be received. Hillah had been the scene of fresh disturbances. Akif Addis Bey, formerly commandant of Kill, having appeared at Musaiyib, with a force estimated at from 4,000-6,000 men (some of whom were said to be fresh troops come down the Euphrates), wrote to the leading Saivid of Hillah, Mohammed Qazwini, demanding a clear passage for his force, which the people of that place refused. Akif Addis reached Hillah on the 15th November and invited the leading inhabitants to come out, under a safe conduct, to meet him. They did so and were immediately seized, the town was occupied, several quarters were demolished, Mohammed Qazwini was imprisoned, and eight other notables were hanged. Saiyid Hadi Qazwini succeeded in escaping, and was stirring up the tribes against the Turks. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. The Kut Prisoners. On the 17th December GI.G.S. telegraphed to C.-in-C. India that confidential information had been received from a reliable source to the following effect. Of the [898-21] C6 white troops taken at Kut only a third had in opinion ’ surv ivors the march and subsequent hard work on a t Affion, Kara Hissar, Ismid, and apparently had been distributed among ^ P these places were in a^ Angora ; owing to failure of supphes ^'^^ImerLans had succeeded in providing r precarious condition two months ago, _ believed British prisoners were getting them with clothing and supplies.

The Central Islamic Society. The general meeting of this society was held at Caxton Hall on the 16th December and wL followed bv a lecture on “Moslems in Hon-Moslem Countries,' given by the Yicomte de Potier.' A reliable correspondent has sent the following accoun meeting and lecture :— The president, Abd-ul-Karim Khan, a law student in London, laid stress on the number of Moslems within the British Empire, saying that one quarter of the to population was Moslem. He said that the Central Islamic Society was not a political body but that in Islam politics and religion were inseparable. • j u 5 the secretary of tlm society stated that the Moslems would not remain dumb when the terms of peace were discussed. He deprecated the untimely movement that some people had started with the intention of upsetting the Caliphate and causing trouble m the ''vicomCde Poitier started his lecture by saying that he had never spoken m public and did not pretend to have a deep knowledge of matters concerning Mam- H e was simply going to relate his personal impressions o the treatment dealt to Muss mans in the Balkan States and other countries he had visited in the summer of 1914 , some even, as for instance Turkestan, in 1913. He could only speak of the way Moslems had been treated in those countries before the war. , A Bosnia-Herzegovina. —He said that these two provinces wer ®’ hl ® ^ no r ^ ie ^f e ’ the only Turkish territory that had benefited by being separated from the Turkish Empire. The Austro-Hungarian rule in the two provinces was very fair and just. The Turkish laws had been kept, and this consideration gave great satisfaction to the Moslems. There was a large number of Moslem schools, probably one thousand, m Bosnia alone, and. about fifty of them were high schools. The Austrian Government endowed Moslem institutions very generously and even helped poor people hnancia y to perform their pilgrimage to Mecca. Possibly the good treatment dealt to Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina was prompted more by political reasons than by sympathy or the Mussulmans. However that may be, the fact was clear that the latter enjoyed full freedom and great wealth in the two annexed provinces. The principal landowners were Moslems. He could not say that the Moslems were as well treated m other parts of the Austrian Empire. There was large numbers of them in Lower Dalmatia, but he had no recollection of seeing any mosques or Moslem schools. _ . Greece. —The Mussulmans inhabiting the provinces occupied by the Greeks^ m consequence of the Balkan war, were very badly treated by the Greek authorities. Their condition was disastrous. Their lives and properties were not sate, specially in Macedonia and southern Epirus. Thousands of families emigrated into Turkey. The Greek authorities stole their money and property. The lecturer said teat he saw in Constantinople thousands of refugees in extreme poverty. Many of them camped out in the open air, although the majority had been cared for by the Turkish Government. At Kavalia Turkish ladies of distinction had been compelled to go about in the streets and collect money for the Greek navy. Roumania. —Most of the Mussulmans in Roumania were Turks and were very well treated by the Roumanians, who have great sympathy for the Turks. Bulgaria. —In Bulgaria proper the Turks and the Bulgarians lived in close contact and were very friendly.Serbia. —The condition of the Moslems was not bad in Old Serbia, but in Macedonia the Serbians ill-treated the Turks and persecuted them. . The lecturer could not enlighten the audience regarding the moral and educational status of the Mussulmans in the Balkan countries. . 1 Mussulmans in Russia.— The lecturer said that Bussia was only second to turkey for the o-ood treatment of the Moslems, t here were no restrictions against them as there were ao-ainst the Jews. In Russian Turkestan, Moslems were the predominant element. The Turcomans were the best Moslems in the world. They received a very kindly treatment at the hands of the Russian authorities. At Sammarcand where rs the tomb of Tamerlane, there were about 150 mosques, but they were all m decay and very badlv kept. The lecturer suggested that the Central Islamic Society should send a petition to the Russian Viceroy of Turkestan asking him that the mosque should be vpntnred and kept in good state of preservation. , , , The lecturer did'not know much about the Caucasian Moslems, but he believed that their condition was a very good one. The only fault the lecturer found with the Russian authorities was that the latter neglected the education and social improvement of the Moslems unlike the Austrian Government. n n f When Potier had finished, the President asked a member by the name of Youssouf Effendi to speak. Youssouf Effendi is a good speaker and a hl g hl y educated r^r^on After conveying his thanks to the lecturer, he said he regretted that the latter L, ^ not Uve anymore information about the Moslems of Caucasus. He had . i m , t k pv we re very advanced educationally, and that the most enlightened Un ^T&lt;rst ojLem w^ere trvlntloTive Islam a national status. They were following the Alfoarh movement in India, of which he. Youssouf Effendi, was a disciple. D After some insignificant remarks from different members, the president asked a , • Atidid Gadir' a young Egyptian student, to move a vote of thinks to the certain Abdul- d J f? ^ P h t . h ded Egyptian nationalist and a fire-eater Afirbes^fos hanks to the lecturer, he saifkat, while Austria-Hungary did t-u' fvr Moslem subiects and helped them financially and socially, and whilst Germany built mosques for the Moslem prisoners, Great Britain and her allies treate fh“oslem subjects shamefully. There was not even a decent burial ground at speaking 0 ^this 8 would have been unanswered, hut Sayid Habib Alimad asked permission to speak.

The Proclamation of the Sherif of Mecca as King of the Arabs. &lt;-&gt; i aa t. ™ rpnorts that on the 2nd of Moharram, The r Ki t the 30th October,T deputation o'f the ashraf, ulemas, and notables corresponding to the &lt;30tn ucto , 1 f p- the nations decision to proclaim gathered in the Sherif s palace m order to submfr to h™ the as th / Moslem him King of the Arabs and a religious ^h ef to them unt world shall decide upon the matter of / of Vecca chief judge and president of The Sherif said have un{ t er t a ken, knowing how my ^peoplekaw backed th“l{ and being convinced of their loyalty and support8 for the realisation of our cause. These sentiments are not limited to this country only. The Arabs in Syria and Irak are also very anxious to recover their ancient glory and their independence. I have received several communications from their leaders on this subject. The object for which you are here to-day may serve to dispel from the minck of those who are not acquainted with the true state of things, the attribution to us ^ any intentions which are at variance with our principles, our honour, the fundamentals of our religion, and the tradition of our family. “ I swear to you by God Almighty that I did not seek the position you are offering me, and never gave it a thought on the day when I joined hands in this happy revolt. I only saw then vvdiat you saw, that we were facing a grave peril and a great calamity, which might have probably overcome us had we not hastened to suppress them. “Tou ha. entrusted me with a task of which I am the first to know the cares and responsibilities. I have always told you that I am one of the people and with them I stand for righ eousness and fight against injustice. I lend a helping hand to those who need assis ance, contiding in God and the precepts of His prophet. If you are firmly set upon carrying your decision, I make it a condition that you help me in my rule ovei you and assist me with your advice and your actions in all things, in order that my expectations and yours may be fulfilled to the advantage of the Arabs and the Moslems. We pray God to help us in every word and action that is agreeable to Him. In Him we put our trust at all events/’ Aftei this the^ nations proclamation was read nominating the Shenf King of the Arabs, and entrusting to him the religious supremacy of Islam until such time that the Moslem world shall have expressed its decision about the caliphate. After the usual invocation to God and the prophet the proclamation recalls the merits of the Arabs, the^ founders of the true religion and the pioneers of science, &amp;c. “ God,” it pioceeds, has cnosen a tribe from the sons of Ismail, • from this tribe he chose the voreish from the Koreish he ^elected the Beni-Hashem, and from Hashem he singled out our prop let yam glorious ancestor, i hrough him we came out of the darkness into light. Your venerated family which brought us to the right path after ignorance is still leading us, and we cannot make a better choice than the one that God has made, knowing your untinng^ efforts for our welfare. Al-Bukh ary said : ‘The leadership is to Koreish, ami txod punches whomever opposes them.’ The prophet said : ‘Koreish will be at the head as long as there will be two left.’ You are a Koreish, and, what is more, you are the descendant ot Hashem, and we can declare before God, on the Day of Judgment, that we have not known a Moslem prince more God-fearing than you, more observant 01 Bs precepts 111 words and deeds, and better fitted to rule over us in a way acceptable to Gocb Ye have kuown you m times of prosperity and distress, in public as well as in private life. here the document comments again upon the great virtues, culture, and noble sentiments of the Arab nation-“ a nation,” it says, ‘‘ which is grateful to its benefactors—-a nation which deserves to be liberated from its heavy chains and emanci pated fiom the tutorship of a party of bloodthirsty vandals and deceivers, who do not possess any pi_ the high qualities and virtues with which the Arab race is endowed It is a glaring injustice that the Arabs should be kept under Ihe rule of men who ought tL L and th l 7 sh ? uld be sub j ected to ill-treatment and persecutions in ame of the same Islam that that gang is undermining.

He then proclaimed him King of all Arabs, according to the book of God and the law of the prophet. APPENDIX (B). The Press. Egyptian Opinion on the Rebellion in Hejaz according to German authorities. The “ Egyptian Gazette ” published, on the 5th October, a further article by Sajid Keshid Bida, the editor of the anti-Turkish Cairo periodical “ El Manar.” After violent attacks on the \oung Fork party, who in atheistic blindness had allied themselves to the enemies of Islam, the German oppressors of the Mohammedans in East Africa, the author returns once again to the rebellion of the Sherif of Mecca. i,: The Sherif, by his rebellion against the present Government in Turkey, has rendered a great service to Islam. Foreseeing the threatening destruction of the Turkish empire, he guaranteed the safety of the Hejaz by freeing her from Turkish rule, thus perhaps laying the foundations of an Arab Mohammedan power. Unity and friendship had never before flourished as they do now among the Arab leaders. The old quarrel still persists between Idrisi and the Imam Yahja, but perhaps the Grand Sherif would be able to reconcile them, so that the whole Arabian peninsula could be ruled on a basis of decentralisation.” Beshid is obliged to admit, much against his will, that the Greater Arabia idea and the Sherif’s methods had not found much favour in Egypt. He continues— “ Egyptian Mohammedans do not appear to sympathise with this movement, in spite of the fact that it is likely to lead to the establishment of an Arab-Islamitic power absolutely independent of foreign influences. Many doubt the possibility of this dream being fulfilled, although they unanimously support the Sherif’s action, in so far as it is directed towards the protection of the holy places against Unionist destruction. The Sherif’s step should therefore be regarded at any rate as harmless, and at the best it may lead to the general benefit of Islam or at least of Hejaz. Every Mohammedan who knows the shameful deeds of the Unionists is their bitter enemy. If Egyptians would only believe the reports published in the £ Mokattam ’ and £ Ahram ’ on the atrocities of Jemal Pasha in Syria, the accuracy of which reports has been corroborated by Turkish prisoners and others, they would turn against the chief promoter of these crimes in the most violent and decided manner. However, the day is not far distant on which they will see the truth.” Beshid Bida’s anger against the Unionists is not hard to understand for anyone wdio knows his past. He was banished from Turkey in Abdul Hamid’s reign, and returned to Syria after the rebellion ; there, under the protection of the independent Government, whose policy he thought he had directed towards the Western Powers, he hoped to continue undisturbed the Arab nationalist propaganda which he had already carried on in Egypt. The Young ’Turks, however, saw through him at once. He failed as candidate for the Young Turk parliament, and yet only a few month’s later turned up in Cairo disappointed and more anti-Turkish than ever. From that time onwards he made no secret of his true character of an agitator for the autonomy of Syria under English supremacy. Later he extended his aims, preaching the pan-Arabian union under the protection of Anglo-Egypt. Before and shortly after the outbreak of the war he travelled for the English to India and the occupied portion of Mesopotamia. He is little liked in Egypt as being a Syrian and a friend of the English. [Extract from “ Korrespondenz-Blatt,” No. 4.] Young Turk v. Arab. Cairo, November 10. I am able to send you another document which the Grand Sherif has allowed to be published now that the right time has come. It constitutes yet another proof—if such be needed at this late hour—of the treacherous policy of the “Young Turks” in [898—21] D10 regard to the Arabs, of their overweening pride, and of their carefully piepared plans for the utter destruction of the Arab national spirit. 7111 Dr oDosed in At the time when El Sayyed Kassim Zemal the deputy or JeddA pr^sed m Parliament: (1) the establishment of primary schools m whl f instructed in the Koran and learn to commit it to memory ; and M th ^ Arabic as the official language in Government departments he ^ ^PP°f f ^ the Arab deputies and even by some of the moderate Tur s. _ e ej ’ i ’ stirred to its depths; there was tumult among the Unionists; and their spo^man Hussein Jahid, made a most arrogant retort: “ bpeak not of the Arabs, nor mention here their language or their books. Let them not think that they are anything but a negligible quantity. Let every Arab deputy know that what the Committee of Union and Progress does not decide upon the Mejliss shall not decide upon. is ec ara 1 provoked loud and indignant protests on the part of three prominent Arab deputies— they have since been hanged in Syria—and the incident would undou e y aye en e in a scuffle had not the president hastily closed the debate and adjourned the sitting That same evening a deputation from the Unionist Club, headed by Hussein Jahid, proceeded to the residence of Sherif Abdullah ; and there a discussion took p ace which was of such a momentous character as to make the meeting an event 01 real hisforica importance. This may be seen by the following translation of a letter sent by the Sherif Abdullah to his father, the Grand Sherif :— “ Had I known, 0 my father, that the Arabs were ‘ a negligible quantity,’ as I have heard to-day in Mejliss-el-Mabouthan [Parliament], I should have far preferred staying in ftabegh or Yambo and the primitive tent life of the deserp to living in your sumptuous palace dominating the hill of Buyukdere, and spending one minute in the hall of the Mejhss to hear what every Arab soul must abhor. Who ever thought that I should hear from Hussein Jahid and his compeers words of threat and intimidation on ancount of certain legitimate demands laid before the Mejliss by the the deputy for Jeddah? The fact of these demands being purely Arab made the Unionists By into a rage and foam; and you will realise the gravity of the situation when I tell you that the session was adjourned on account of the heated discussion and dispute that ensued. “ You can imagine my state when Hussein Jahid, accompanied by his clique, actually said in my own house : £ You Arabs shall not be able to revive your tongue in the Ottoman Empire so long as the Unionist Government is at its head. And the book which you so extol, and of which you are so proud, on account of its Arab origin, shall unfailingly be translated into Turkish, so that Turkish eyes shall no more pass over Arabic sayings.’ What would you do, oh my my father, when I tell you what Hussein Jahid said about you on Anwar’s [ Enver’s] behalf : ‘ The voice of the Arabs was low before your father succeeded to the emirship of Mecca ; but as soon as he took up the post this voice began to grow louder and louder, until it almost stopped the progress of our programme. But we have taken our precautions and the necessary measures for stifling it ; because if the Arab traitors were to be allowed power in the empire, then all our hopes and our people would be consigned to perdition ? ’ “ All this I heard, by thy truth, oh my lord and father, from Hussein Jahid, and I do not wish to repeat further sayings—which would only stir thy anger and and provoke thy displeasure—uttered by those traitors who, but yesterday, were holding up their arms to implore our help, and who now, through the power of the Committee Club, have risen to the might of a Sultan. It is my wish now to retire from this Mejliss. In reply to all those foolish and deluded utterances I only said that the Arab nation does not need to resort to the exercise of power to regain its rights, and has too much sense to afford you an occasion that you have been seeking all along. We the Arabs, are persuaded that if our pacific endeavours shall not prove sufficient to make us regain our usurped rights, Allah will be the guarantor thereof at the very end. For to Him the unknown is an open book. “ Your obedient son, “ Abdullah.” After this moving missive was gone through his Highness passed to the reader a copy of the paper “ A1 Islah ” (Reform), which used to be published in Jeddah, and which was suppressed simply because, following this incident, it made some outspoken comments on the Unionists and the declaration of their spokesman that what the Committee does not decide the Mejliss shall not decide. [The “Near East,” 15th December, 1916.]Belief for Sy via. ' Cairo IS!oroTvilyor 21 The fact that well-known neutrals, who left Syria this summer, have confirmed the -^previous reports that over 80,000 souls have perished in that unhappy country, either directly through inanition, or indirectly through disease brought about by poor or insufficient food, has roused the relief committees m England and .America to energetic action. Syrians here have been watching with the deepest interest and satisfaction the magnificent movement in England, in which so many prominent Englishmen are taking part. In America, the land of practical action, the desired solution seems to have been reached. The American Eed Cross agent here recently received a telegram from ISlew York informing him that a ship had been given to the Syrian Relief Committee, and asking that the president of the Cairo Relief Committee should remit the funds that he had now available. On the next day another telegram was received by the Cairo Committee from the New York Syrian Committee to the effect that the American Government has placed a steamer at the disposal of the committee, that further sums were required for the purchase of the necessary foodstuffs, and that a remittance of these sums by cable was required. To these two messages the Syrian Committee to the effect that the American Government has requested authority from the allies to send a steamer from Egypt, and that their reply and the remittance of funds must depend upon the reply. Meantime a telegraphic assurance was requested as to whether it was clearly ascertained that the admission of the steamer to the port of Beyrout was definitely agreed upon. The American Committee for the Relief of Syrians and Armenians in Turkey then replied in the affirmative, and asked again for the remittance of the available funds. The Cairo Committee replied that negotiations had already been begun with the repre sentatives of the allies regarding the sending of a steamer from Egypt, and that no further advice could be given before the receipt of the official reply. And again the question was asked whether the United States had an unequivocal assurance from their Ambassadors in London and Constantinople that the ship would be allowed into the port of Beyrout. The reply affirmed that Turkey and the allies have granted permission for the relief ship to enter Beyrout, and again required a telegraphic remittance of the available funds. The Cairo Committee’s reply was that the remittance of funds was impossible without a special licence from the allies. And there the matter has since stood. In this connection it is painful to record that, in spite of the fact that the Grand Rabbi and the Grand Shaykh of A1 Azhar, as well as other spiritual heads, have been given their due place on the General Committee, and that it was clearly laid down in the rules of the committee that the funds to be collected were destined for distribution to all sufferers in Syria, irrespective of creed or denomination, few, if any, subscriptions have been made by Moslems or Jews in this country. This deplorable apathy has apparently reacted on other important centres in Egypt, such as Alexandria, Tantah, Mansourah, &amp;c., where the Syrian community is fairly important, and some of its members are wealthy ; for very little has been done, and several wealthy Syrians, who have, unfortunately, a poor reputation for munificence, have taken this as an excuse for not subscribing to the fund. Sooner or later Syrians abroad will have to return to their country. For, once it is freed from despotic rule, they are sure to find there more prosperity and real happiness than in any other country; and if only they realised that by allowing the destruction of their compatriots at home they are indirectly destroying their own future happiness and prosperity, even the most miserly among them with any practical sense would no longer stint his help. _ Fears are entertained about the fate of the relief funds or foodstuffs if the Ottoman Red Crescent were to have a hand in the distribution, and to a certain extent such fears are not unjustified. On the other hand, the Americans’ moral and material interests in Syria are such as to make the depopulation of the country a very serious problem for them. Therefore, even apart from humanitarian considerations, the American Red Cross in Syria may well be expected to make the fullest possible use of the relief funds and foodstuffs. | The “Near East,” 15 th December, 1916.] PSIHTM) AT THK FOREIGN OFFICE RT C.

This week’s report covers an emergency period in Hejaz affairs. To get at the root of the matter quickest it would be advisable to read telegram No. 72 giving the Senior Naval Officer’s views on the situation ; it will he found specially marked on page 3. It is to be noted that this is practically the only first hand information that there is, the rest is made up of rumours and observations. There is a want of precis'on and proportion in the information transmitted from Hej az. For instance, the word “ patrol” is twice used of a force which was sufficient to fight some 2,000 or 3,000 tribesmen ; again, the Arabs are reported as announcing that the Turkish Sinai army was seen coming to Hejaz, which cannot possibly be true, though reinforcements may quite possibly be dribbling into Medina. r Arab tribesmen will never adopt tactics foreign to their nature, viz., an immobile defensive against formal Turkish attacks. If they did they would share the fate of the forces of the Sultan of Darfur, and all other savage irregulars who get obstinate and over confident. Attention is drawn to another point, nothing tends more to confuse a situation than a constant inflow of intelligence which has no sequence in point of view of time; thus we get the results of an aeroplane reconnaissance of a day old followed by Captain Lawrence’s appreciation of a situation based on gossip a week or ten days old. It would appear advisable that Hejaz intelligence should be disentangled and appreciated on the spot, and London and Khartum kept informed of the situation by a sequence of telegrams in which attention was paid to military and political values. When the Sirdar reaches Cairo, it must be remembered that his attention will be much more fully occupied by local administrative questions than at present. Political Situation in Hejaz. The question of the Sherif s title seems now to be settled. The Sherif’s attitude towards Christian troops in Hejaz represents his better judgment, though naturally like everyone else he has moments when temptation is very great. The reports of the presence of Enver and Jemal in Medina should be received with great caution, Enver’s presence is most unlikely, and Jemal may well prove to be another officer of the same name. The suspicions of Paris in regard to the Sherif’s loyalty are apparently based on certain reports of Ben Ghabrit of some time ago,* and not much attention need be paid to them. Colonel Bremond’s visit to Khartum is of good augury, showing that the French Mission is growing more co-operativein response to a certain amount of stimulant, which was applied from official French quarters about ten days ago. [898—20] vsT •— 2 Aden and Idrissi. With regard to the proposal to knight Idrissi, it is suggested (a) that the Sirdar should be consulted, and (b) that Idrissi should take some kind of action which will enable him to win his spurs. Nothing has been heard of him since the Comfida incident, except that he asked for a telephone a month ago. Armenian Report. The Armenian Report, Appendix A, is strongly recommended for careful reading. The story is odious and disgusting, but nevertheless hears out everything that has been reported from other independent sources. Lieutenant Shaykha and Lieutenant Shurbaji, it will be remembered, gave almost word for word accounts of similar scenes and similar policy. They were Moslems, and professed to dislike Armenians ; the present writer is equally little predisposed to sympathise with Armenians. It is suggested that some means should be taken to give due publicity to this state of affairs, in view of the appeals to “ God and humanity which the enemy is now making. Lord Headley’s Lapse. The conviction of Lord Headley for drunkenness is of some importance. He is a pro-Turkish leader, and has been associated with Kidwai, Field, Rosher, Pickthall, Zeynab Charlton, Parfit, and other sympathisers with the enemy. He has been made much of in pan-Islamic papers both before and since the war began. M. S.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s GovernmeaxL] The Sherif of Me cca.

A telegram of the 7th December [No. 61] from the Sirdar, giving an unfavourable report of the situation, was printed in the last report [p. 1]. He telegraphed further on the 7th December [No. 65], saying that he had just received a copy of haisals report to the Sherif, in which he said that the Turkish Sinai army was seen coming to Heiaz,” but he was unable to decide whether the main Turkish concentration was at Bir Said or at Wady Safra ; in the former case it would be directed against Yambo, in the latter against Babegh. The Sirdar said, in regard to the Sinai army, that he had no corroboration of the despatch of large Turkish reinforcements from the north. Colonel Wilson had reported that day, the 7th December, that an emergency period appeared to be imminent; he advised that at least a brigade of troops, with the necessary artillery, should be held in readiness for immediate embarkation at Suez. Tbe Sirdar concurred with Colonel Wilson’s recommendation. The Turkish forces, he said, now based on Medina had remained inactive, either through fear of the impending arrival of foreign regular troops to reinforce the Arabs, or on account of a tear of attacks.

Present informa tion, however, indicated that those considerations might no longer deter the Turks from undertaking a resolute offensive which, having regard to the nature of the^Arab forces in the field, would almost certainly result, within the space of a few weeks, in the entry of a Turkish force into Mecca. On the following day, the 8th December, the Sirdar further telegraphed [No. 66] that he had received a report from Yambo to the effect that the Harb tribesmen had been driven back by a Turkish patrol which had entered Wady Safra near Hamra, 10 miles east of Kheif. The Harb were unable, being without artillery support, to face the Turks, and would not rally for a week. Zeyd, with Egyptian artillery, tried to assist, was forced to retire to the neighbourhood of Yambo. Humour stated that Jemal and perhaps Enver, with his staff officer Kazim, arrived at Medina ten days ago with reinforcements ; also that the Turks had supplies for a month and the mahmal with them. If this is true presumably the Turks intended to go to Mecca. Faisal had 5,000 Arabs with him at Nakhl ; he begged for a British diversion from Sinai to help relieve pressure. Full details of the aeroplane reconnaissances had not been received, but apparently the wadys immediately east of T ambo were all clear. On receipt of this the Foreign Office telegraphed [No. 34J to the Sirdar asking whether he could do anything at Babegh to prepare position in advance of the possible landing of troops, so that defences might be ready for them should they be sent. To this he replied [No. 69] that the personnel of the Egyptian batteries, the guns of which had been handed to the Arabs, and the Egyptian aeroplane escort were at Rabegh with a certain number of entrenching tools. They could do some of the preliminary work, and, pending instructions from the Foreign Office to begin defensive works for a brigade of British troops, he should instruct Major Jouce to make all preparations. The water difficulty was not yet solved, but he was in communication with the Admiral and with the chief of the Egyptian force, and hoped that some satisfactory arrangement might be devised. This telegram was despatched on the 10th December, but on the previous day the Sirdar had, in continuation of his telegram No. 65 of the 7th December, telegraphed [No. 68j to the following effect. That the Turks really meant business, he had but little doubt. Colonel Parker, who had just come to Egypt from Rabegh, reported on the 6th December that the Turks had succeeded in separating the Arab forces under Ali, based on Rabegh, from those under Faisal based on Yambo ; that the situation of Abdulla was unknown; and that the Arabs were acting against the Turkish flanks in a desultory manner, but could not be relied on for the defence of Yambo, Rabegh, or any other position against Turkish troops with artillery. The Sirdar continued by saying that his then information indicated that the immediate effect of the Turks was to brush aside Faisal and his 5,000 Arabs to the north and then to occupy Yambo. In that case Yambo would have to be evacuated, the stores and foreign personnel being transferred by sea to Rabegh ; the admiral commanding-in-chief had informed him that he had sent a monitor to Yambo which, in that contingency, would be of invaluable assistance. In regard to Rabegh all military opinions agreed that, even with naval assistance, the local Arab forces were incapable of defending it against a determined attack by the Turks. Consequently, there were onlv two alternatives :— 1. To despatch from Egypt to Rabegh at least one regular brigade with the necessary artillery; if the Turks should go first to Yambo these troops would still arrive in time to put Rabegh into a state of defence and so keep it from them. 2. Jo make preparations to remove aeroplanes, stores, and foreign personnel from Babegh as soon as information should be received that the Turkish advance to that place had actually begun ; the effect of which on the morale of the Arabs would be very bad. On the following day, 10th December, he telegraphed [No. 70 again. Jeddah d reported that messages had been received by the Sherif from Faisal and Zeid. The former said that the bulk of the Turkish force in Hejaz appeared to be operating agamst him : he begged that Rabegh might be held, to enable him to achn the &gt; 500 'sYr el T h T ( P r fT ab k 01 i the Turklsh flanks a “ d rear). Zeid asked for 500 soldiers, to go to Yambo ; his plans were uncertain Rth nY f a p reP r rt r d foC? b 6 ni 2 ht of the 7th December and the day of the December Faisal s force had had an unsuccessful encounter with a strong Turkish3 ma- i'oia n ces ■try 66 ] lad ira, to ied hat ays nal isal to Jen n g ble To ch ry or is. ae patrol, l aisal had arrived at Yambo with some 1,500 Arabs. His Juheina tribesmen fought badly and apparently had left him. Colonel Wilson had been instructed to make it clear that owing to the delay in the organisation of trained bands, due to Arab slackness and unwillingness to accept Expert advice, the local Arab forces at Rabegh could not defend it against a strong Turkish attack, even if they had naval assistance. On the 11 th December the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 71 j Colonel Wilson’s report of his interview with the Sherif. Colonel Wilson said that the Sherif asked for six battalions of regular troops of 500 men each. But he telegraphed later on the same day [No. 73] saying that the Sherif had cancelled this request and wished a British brigade, ready to proceed immediately on his request, to be kept at Suez or Port Sudan, but his immediate need was 1,500 Moslem troops at Rabegh and 500 at Yambo. Colonel Wilson had fully explained the situation and danger, and the Sherif thoroughly understood the situation; his great fear was the effect which the landing of Christian troops in Hejaz would have on Moslem opinion. On the 11 th December the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 72] that on the 9th December Faisal had been interviewed at Yambo by the senior naval officer of the Northern Red Sea Patrol, who reported that the Arabs admitted that the strength of the Turkish force opposing them had been exaggerated, and that their own retirement was not a necessity—the incapacity of Arab levies to meet regular Turkish troops in the held was, he regretted to say, a constant and apparently irreparable factor in the Hejaz military situation. Yambo was considered secure against Turkish raids, thanks to naval assistance. An extended reconnaissance made on the 8 th December-by a flying machine reported the presence of regular Turkish troops at Kheif, possibly the Turkish head quarters ; that the camp at Hamra was larger ; and that there were tents at Umdheiyal and Hazma. Bir Said was not located. It was satisfactory to note that no large parties of Turks were observed nearer the coast. At Rabegh the British commandant had been instructed to arrange, with naval assistance, for the defence of the aeroplane base against a Turkish raiding party; this position being also designated, in case the Turks should attack in strength ; he would carry out such work as ne could on the extended position to be held for the permanent defence of Rabegh by a brigade of British troops if the latter should be sent. , On the same day the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 74] saying that he had instructed Colonel Wilson to inform the Sherif that he had telegraphed his message to ^ His Majesty’s Government ; that he understood his difficulty, and hoped that his decision to cancel his application for the immediate despatch of six European batta ions to Rabeoffi would be justified by events. At the same time he must point out that according to the opinion of experts on the spot, the 1,500 Moslems he had askec or, even if they were immediately available, which was not the case, would be mcapa &gt; e of defending Rabegh against a strong attack by the Turks, and therefore m won c no , from a military point of view, be wise to send them there. The bheru was aware that the military assistance which we bad hitherto rendered had been greatly restricted by our desire not to offend Moslem susceptibilities; his decision, therefore masmuch as it affirmed the necessity to mainiain the restriction, also clearly admitted this responsibility for its immediate consequences. . , x T j u&gt; qqai! od-no- On the same day the Foreign Office telegraphed to Lord Bertie Wo. 2947] , &amp; him to inform the President of the Council as to the instructions which had been sen. to the Sirdar, and to ask that orders might be sent for the despatch of x renc i ai t0 R On S the same day the Foreign Office further telegraphed [Noy 6 ] to the Sirdar that the French Government would not send infantry, as it considered that it was tor His Majesty’s Government to do so; that we did not wish, except m the ast extremity to land troops in Hejaz, but, if possible, the Shent must be sa gY7SY YffierTshmdd as at present advised Moslem troops could not be sent, but if at Habegh there should still be time for preparing an entrenched position, and if one brigade with the necessary frtmerv &amp;c could hold it, he was authorised to despatch those troops from Suez whenever he should receive a request from the Sherif, but he must be satisfied that the force was sufficient, and that it could be supphed with water and all necessities. On the 12 th December the Sirdar telegraphed [No. /5j that he should l e action hi regard to either a British brigade or the French artillery at Suez pending information Warding the conversations between the Sherif and Colonel Wilson at Jeddah on that day and the arrival at Khartum on the 14th of Captain Lloyd ana Colonel Bremond. ' He added that, in view of the lack of organisation a ana ic failing morale, in the Sherifian forces, together with the copious rainfall, i-saea? .jggzgmm facilitated enemy movements, two British officers whom he bad^ sent to Hejaz to report on the Arab military situation, and the possibility of preventing a successful Turkish advance on Mecca, were very pessimistic in regard to both points. Later in the day he telegraphed again [No. 76], saying that it had been reported from Babegh by the aeroplane reconnaissance that Wadi Fura was apparently clear offi the enerav as far as Mukka ; and from Yambo that on the 10 th December a seaplane successfully fired into and bombed a force of about 400 Turks, encamped -0 miles north west of [? Nakhl] Mubar[ak]; that the morale of the Arabs at Babegh and Yambo was somewhat restored ; and that on the 14th December he expected Captain Lloyd and , Colonel Bremond with the latest news from Jeddah. On the 13th December he sent a long telegram [No. 77], consisting of over three foolscap pages, of which what follows forms tho gist. Captain Lawrence says that Faisal considers that the loss of Wady Safra has changed the situation, and that the Arabs would welcome the landing of British troops at Babegh. Colonel Wilson, Mr. Storrs, and the Sherif discussed this question ; the Sherif considers that the landing of the British would do great harm, and still asks for Moslem troops. Commenting on this, the Sirdar recommends holding a British brigade in readiness at Port Sudan, as no Moslem troops are available. It is understoud that it will take some time to collect sufficient transport to convey the brigade to Port Sudan. The Sirdar has instructed Colonel Wilson to explain the situation to the Sherif, and to point out to him that his decision not to have British troops, except at the last moment, puts upon him the responsibility for the collapse of the Arab movement, should this come about. Arrange ment are being made to evacuate the Egyptian detachments at Babegh and Yambo m the event of a Turkish attack. ie fm The Question of French Assistance, The Foreign Office telegraphed [No. 2920] to the Ambassador in Paris on the 9th December, saying that the French Government had proposed to send a brigade to Babegh, and instructing him to urgently enquire whether they still intended to do so, how soon it would start, and of what nature it would be. Lord Bertie replied on the following day [No. 1312], saying that the military attache had had a conversation with the Chief of the General Staff (General Duportj, by whom he was informed that the French Government was ready to send immediately the men at their disposal if His Majesty’s Government would also despatch an infantry force sufficiently large to support them. This was a necessary proviso, as the French were only prepared to send one battery of 80 mm., another of 75, and about a company of machine guns. In a later telegram [No. 1312] of the same date, he says that he had asked the Secretary-General whether the French Government intended to send troops to Babegh, and that he had replied saying that his Government still considered that it was for His Majesty’s Government to furnish the necessary contingents of infantry. He said, too, that the French Government did not wish to appear to seek the position in Arabia which seemed to them to belong to Great Britain. Lord Bertie had already telegraphed [No. 1306] on the 9th December, saying that he had received a note, dated the 8 th December, from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, enclosing a memorandum from the Minister for War, and maintaining the view set out m the note of the 13th November that the only way to prevent the reoccupation of Babegh by the Turks was to land at that place a sufficient infantry force to form a “ veritable corps de bataille ’; that this force should be provided by the British ; and that French Moslem technical detachments could only be of use as auxiliaries. The ships oil Babegh would support the defence, and the barrage thus established would prevent the Turks from using the coast roads and make the eastern roads difficult for them. Babegh would become a base from which the Arabs could operate with some safety in the interior. A further note, dated the 9th December, upheld those views, the Irench Government being confirmed in them by the Sirdar’s telegram No. 61 [see Arabian Bepprt, N.S., XX, p. 1 ]. The memorandum of the Minister of War concluded with the statement that if His Majesty’s Government was not disposed to send infantry to Babegh, the French technical units could not be landed there. In that case they would be landed at Jeddah to support the Sherif’s army should he so desire. They induced na tive officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, Spahis and Tirailleurs, one 80 field battery, one 80 mountain battery, eight machine-gun sections, and one Engineer company, and were ready at Suez with some French cadres and experts. Ou the 11th December the Foreign Office telegraphed to Lord Bertie lel'erring to toe instructions sent to the Sirdar in telegram No. 36, recorded above, and asking him5 /eport Ported learof planer norti bo wag 'd and, ^ r three s that at the Wilson, Hiding ingon ^ as no lolled ’noted at his ai the , ano , e- ibo in i the !e to 0 do tarj irtj, ielj try the t a ays . to still sary a to tain, that fairs, tout in of rm a and The ' Tould It for some dews, [ [see [uded send ; case They leurs, 1 one ngto rhifl 1 to infoim the President of the Council of those instructions, and requesting that orders not be sent for the despatch of French artillery to Pabegh. On the 12 th December Lord Bertie telegraphed [No. 1323] that two new batteries of mountain guns had been ordered by the French Government to be sent to Suez ; the material of one of them would be sent by the first steamer leaving for Suez. The personnel would be Turco (sic) —Arab. In a second telegram of the same date [No. 1327] he said that the French Govern ment recapitulated the views it had already expressed, and hoped that His Majesty’s Government would give the necessary orders for the constitution of a base of resistance at Rabe &amp; h. A. s soon as the organisation at Rabegh of an infantry corps should make it possible for French units to intervene without being exposed to useless sacrifice, the French Government was quite ready to co-operate within the limits it had already laid down. The French Government had repeated that any delay might, in the opinion of French experts, have disagreeable consequences, and might result in either the Arabs being crushed on the first encounter or the Sherif coming to an arrangement with the Turks —an arrangement of which a rumour was recently current in Mecca. The Sherif s Title. The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 62] on the 6 th December, saying that Sir H. McMahon had informed him that he agreed with his, the Sirdar’s, objection to the title suggested by the French Government, as its religious significance was too great. Sir H. McMahon, however, would prefer the shorter title, “ King of Hejaz,” for the reason that if the longer one were adopted (“ King of Arabs in Hejaz”), the last two words would in practice be likely to disappear. On the 7 th December Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy [P. 5097] asking his opinion as to the French proposal and mentioning the title preferred by the Sirdar; the latter, although it would safeguard the other Arab chiefs, would, he suggested, unless it were accompanied by assurances, cause the Sherif to suspect our good faith in respect of the limits of the Arab kingdom or confederation already recognised. The Viceroy replied on the 8 th December. The Indian Government strongly deprecated the French proposal as calculated to excite serious religious resentment, as it would connote a definite claim to the Caliphate. “ King of Arabs in Hejaz and its Dependencies” might meet the case, as this would suggest Arab union, be inoffensive to other chiefs, would avoid religion, and might satisfy the Sherif as to our good faith without specific territorial assurances which would be difficult to formulate. On the 9 th December Sir P. Cox telegraphed [T. 559] that he did not like the word “ malik ” and suggested the combined temporal and spiritual title, “ Sultan Al Hejaz liami-al-Haranmain.” “ Hami ” is the word used in translating “ Protector of the Faith ” in the King’s title; if a purely temporal title should be preferred, “ Amir ” mio-ht be substituted for “ Hami.” On receipt of this telegram, Sir A. Hirtzel informed the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that, in the circumstances, Mr. Chamberlain thought it would be best to adopt Sir H. McMahon’s proposal, &lt;£ King f* IIo* ?? On the 11 th December the Foreign Office telegraphed [No. 35] to the Sirdar that His Majesty’s Government had decided after consideration that the most suitable title would be “ Malik-el-Hejaz ” with the honorific style “ Siyada.” It was understood unofficially that the French Government would probably concur and send instructions in that sense to Colonel Bremond. A Suggested Conference. On the 8 th December the Foreign Office telegraphed to the Sirdar [No. 33] saying that it had been suggested that he should meet the Resident at Aden and Sn P. Cox to discuss the general situation. The Secretary of State considered that the meeting mio-ht be advantageous and if the Sirdar should agree would try to arrange it lhe Sirdar replied [No. 67] on the following day that the plan seemed to him an excellent one and he should await instructions at Khartum. On the 11 th December the Secretary of State for India telegraphed [P. 5204] to the Viceroy informing him of the proposed conference and asking him, if he should see no objection, to instruct gir P. Cox to arrange details with the Sirdar direct. 898—20] C6 The Sherif and, the Shaykhs. On the 12 th December Sir Percy Cox telegraphed [No. 6778] to the Sirdar, for transmission, the purport of the message to the Sherif m reply to is message o congratulation on the Koweyt meeting. It was to fcne following effect: lo your Highness we tender our profoundest respects, and intimate that we harve lead, the affectionate and fatherly message conveyed, through the representative of Great Britain at Cairo, to your sincere admirers, congratulating us on the results of our meeting at Koweyt ’with Abdul Aziz Bin Saud. To promote the welfare of the Arab nation and of Islam, and to strengthen the ties which bind us to your Highness and to the honouied British Government, was the desire of our meeting, and we hope that the union thus formed will continue with happy results. For the furtherance of this sacred purpose, it behoves us sincerely to act together. All who have zeal for the Aiab nation will no doubt rejoice and follow our example and lead ; those who qo not will never again he brought into the right way. You say that, had you known of our meeting previously, vou would have sent a representative ; we should have been overjoyed theieat had God so wdlled it. In any event, we pray God to advance all your praiseworthy endeavours, and we remain your Holiness’s devoted adherents. May you ever live happy and glorious, and may we gain your favours ! The Sherif s Protest against Turkish Cruelties The Viceroy telegraphed on the 2 nd December to say that a message from Fuad- el-Katib protesting against Turkish cruelties [see Arabian Beport XIX N.S., p. 4], and addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Kabul had _ been received. The Viceroy asked for instructions, saying that there was no objection on the part of the Indian Government to its being passed to Kabul through the ordinary channel. And on the 5 th December the Viceroy telegraphed (referring to a telegram from the India Office of the same date) that the message from Mecca was being allowed to pass through to Kabul. The Hejaz Bailway. The cutting of the Hejaz railway was mentioned in the Arabian Beport N.S. XIX, at p. 4. The Sheriffs organ, the “ Kibla,” gives the following account of the event : Faisal’s men blew up twenty-four arches of the railway bridge in the valley containing the station of Buat, between Ibiar Nassif and Hafirat, some 35 miles from Medina. They removed the rails between Gazeh and Baiadieh, and also for a distance of over a mile and a-half, in the neighbourhood of Ghazail. Arab Prisoners sent from Russia. On the 8 th December the G. 0. C.-in-C. telegraphed [LA. 2723j that the Sherif was employing and paying Lieutenant Ahmed Shaykha, and that, on the termination of his course in machine gunnery, which he was taking in Egypt, Captain Shukri Shurbaji would be employed and paid in the same way. See Arabian Beport N.S. XI, pp. 1 ss.] The Sherif and Mr. Storrs. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 1062] on the 8 th December that he was sending Mr. Storrs to Jeddah, as the Sherif was anxious to meet him. Sir H. McMahon said that he was giving Mr. Storrs no definite instructions beyond telling him to do his best to remove any misunderstanding that might exist in the Sherifs mind owing to irresponsible statements by Faruki, and making him the bearer of his personal farewell. IDBISI of AS IB. The Besident at Aden telegraphed on the 8 th December |_.286 A.P.] that H.M.S. “ Lunka had reported on the 6 th December that Idrisi had been interviewed, at his request, and that he had said that the Turks, using his friendship with the British as a lever, were trying to disaffect some of his inland tribes. With a view to their attacking the lurks in that district and capturing Lohaiya, Idrisi was negotiating with the tribes inland of that place ; he hoped to begin operations shortly. On the 11 th December the Besident telegraphed [289 A.P.] to the IndianGovernment again, urging that the K.C.I.E. should he conferred on Idrisi, and saying that if this were approved he should like to send Colonel Jacob to interview him and invest him with the decoration. HADHRAMiT. The G.O.C. straits Settlements addressed a letter to the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements regarding the Sultan of Hadhramat in which he said: — 1- 1 he impression among the Arabs in Singapore was that there was some trouble between the Sultan of Hadhramat and the Sultan of Maccala. The latter Sultan had, up to now, been recognised as the suzerain power, Hadhramat being a sort of vassal under Maccala. Hadhramat now, apparently, resented this state of affairs, and was trying to free itself from the Maccala yoke. 2 . It was believed that the Sultan of Hadhramat’s principal adviser was Abdur Rahman (as to whom the Foreign Secretary of the Government of India had telegraphed enquiries), supported by Sayed Hassan Bin Saleh A1 Bahur, and Alkaffs of Hadhramat. No one of the .three was known to be anti-British. They were well known in Singapore, and the two last-mentioned had property there, as also the Sultan of Hadhramat, who had for his agents Alsagoff and Co. 3. There was a feeling in Singapore that, whatever their aims in respect of the connection with Maccala might be, Abdur Rahman and his two supporters were unlikely to do anything directly prejudicial to British interests. It was regarded as somewhat unlikely that the Hadhramat Arabs, as a whole, would wish any harm to the British, as a large number of them had considerable vested interests in British territory outside Arabia. What was considered more probable was that the Turks were, perhaps, desirous of winning Abdur Rahman over to their side, as it was well known that he had considerable influence with the Sultan of Hadhramat. 4 . It had been noticed that there was a strong prejudice in favour of Abdur Rahman in Singapore. It was felt that Aden’s information that the man was plotting with the Turkish general at Lahej might be wrong. The Arabs in Singapore said that he was apparently deadly opposed to Hadhramat being, in any way, under Maccala. PART II. POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. In the last report there was a telegram from the Resident, saying that the Sherif had sent an envoy who came with a letter for Colonel Wilson ; he was writing letters to all friendly Arabs, his object being to bring about the union of the Arab nation, the realisation of which, the Resident said, would depend on British help in money, arms, and ammunition. . Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed [P. 4990] on the 8 th December to the Viceroy, saving that of course the Resident would submit any definite proposals for support w T hich he mi^ht think suitable. This was repeated to the Resident. On the following day the Resident telegraphed [283 A.P.] that at present he aid not consider it advisable to make a definite offer to the envoy, but rather to await confirmation of the movement of the Imam’s son and the result thereof. In the meam time the envoy was in communication with the Imam and with the neighbouring chie s. Saiyid Mohammed Darwish, whose proclivities were towards the British, was Lien at Aden His father urged early action to combine with the Imamic movement, and he was anxious to act against the Turkish, communications : he asked ^ 10,000 rounds of ammunition and a small money present ( 1,000 rupees), both of which the Resident had given him. He had also assured the envoy ana Darwish that he would give the Arabs active support if they really acted, and would help them with ammunition, inere was undoubtedly a tendency on the part of the Arabs to move against the lurks but they waited for us to give them the initiative. The .Resident was of opinion that, i i could net sufficient reinforcements to justify his moving against tne 1 urks and es a - Sing the British in Lahej, the position of the Turks would be precarious. Tor wmcn purpose with operations limited to Lahej, he originally estimated the required reinioroe- mente at 2 good infantry battalions, 2 squadrons of cavalry, and 1 garrison regiment.8 The Resident telegraphed [920/U] on the 6 th December that there was an uncon firmed report that 500 Turks with four mountain guns had left Lahej for Sana on the night of the 4 th— 5 th December, and on the 7 th December he telegraphed again [920/3] to say that with the intention of testing this report and reducing the probability of such withdrawals he had on that day driven the enemy out of Jabir and Mahat. Two^ prisoners were taken, and our casualties were five officers wounded, other ranks four killed, fifty-six wounded, the enemy’s casualties were estimated as being at least [? equal to] ours. No confirmation of the report of the Turkish movement bad been received. On the 12 th December he telegraphed [920/7] that Rafaat Bey, the Turkish commander at Fiyusii, had been deprived of his command and placed under arrest ; that many Arab desertions had been reported ; and that the enemy casualties on the 7th December were estimated at 150, Lower Mesopotamia. A telegram was sent from Basra to the C.G.S., India, on the 5th December saying that four French African soldiers, one non-commissioned officer, and three privates, had deserted from the Turks and joined the British force. They were being sent to Bombay with a view to their being sent to Egypt, and then made over to the French. PART III. Enver Pasha on Turkish Operations. Reuter, telegraphing from Amsterdam on the 5th December, says that reports from Constantinople to German payers say that, Enver Pasha, when submitting the new credits to Parliament, reviewed the activity of Turkish troops in the various war centres and inter alia said that :— (a.) Turkish troops, after defeating the English in Iraq, met the Russians and barred their entrance to Iraq. (b.) Persian warriors now formed regular units trained by the Turks, and were fighting against the enemies of the latter. (c.) Turkish troops were sent to the Balkans to enable the German troops to operate at other points. (d.) The despatch of such great masses of troops out of the country would in no wise endanger the safety of the Turkish Empire, as Turkey had sufficient forces to defend her territory, and important reserves to send abroad. (e.) In regard to the Egyptian expedition, in the course of operations east of Egypt, Turkish troops advanced in order to reconnoitre the enemv forces, and retreated in order to prepare great undertakings. (/.) The aim pursued in Egypt was in no wise abandoned, and the necessary forces for the Egyptian campaign will be ready at the given moment. (g.) The Turkish troops in Arabia did their duty as those of Galicia and the Caucasus. The last reports said that our soldiers, in co-operation with the native force, drove the English back to Aden, and frustrated various naval enterprises. (h.) The movement in Hejazwas in itself unimportant, could not spread, and would soon be suppressed. f 'fAPPENDIX (A). Addendum to “ Ejeport oe an Inhabitant of Athlit, Mount Carmel, Syria.” T The writer, when speaking of the treatment meted out to the Armenians by the Ul ks since le eginnuig of the war, fears that he will be accused of exaggeration. tie lias kept tins m view when describing atrocities committed by the Turks. ( w^ter has not been in-Armenia proper, but has lived in Syria since the war ngan, and has visited Konia and Constantinople, and has many acquaintances including Germans. ^ ’ Th e F irst News of the Massacres. Turkish Policy. Opinion of Local Germans. During October and December 19 L 5 several Germans, established as farmers in Palestine, returned to Haifa and Jaffa, and they were the first to bring the news of wholesale massacres among the Armenians. Nothing had been said on the subject in the Syrian and Palestine press. At first these Germans maintained that thev knew litule about the matter ; that they had only heard some reports, which they considered very exaggerated. But from these and other Germans he met at Damascus,* he gathered that the Germans themselves thought that the Turks had determined to exterminate a ,11 the Armenians, with the exception of about half a million. The Germans at that time, to give them their due, were horrified at the thought of such wholesale slaughter; there was, however, a notable exception, a Major Pohl, who was heard to say that he was sorry that as many as half a million Armenians should be spared. A number of Germans in Palestine sent their families away, openly saying that the lurk might one day treat Germans as they were then using the Armenians. Armenians dying along the Railway. There were a number of reports of thousands of Armenians lying dead by the side of the railway between Anatolia and Syria, and the writer is able to corroborate these rumouss by accounts given by his sister, who travelled from Constantinople to Palestine in December 1915. The State of Armenians ordered South. She saw the bodies of hundreds of Armenian men, women, and children lying on both sides of the railway. Sometimes Turkish women were seen searching the corpses for anything that might be of value ; at other times dogs were observed feeding on the bodies. There were hundreds of bleached skeletons. At either Gulek or Osmanieh she saw thousands of starving and fever-stricken Armenians. They had been ordered southward, but had been provided with no transport, and had been waiting there for weeks. They were lying about the station, on the sidings, and some on the track itself. Some were jostled on to the line when the train arrived, and the engine ran over them to the joy of the engine driver, who shouted to his friends “ Did you see how I smashed about fifty of these Armenian swine f Attitude of Turkish Officers. The writer’s sister fainted at the sight, and on recovery two Turkish officers, speaking French, remonstrated with her on her lack of patriotism since the Armenians were enemies. She also gives details of the misery and death caused by over-crowding railway carriages and trucks when transport was from time to time provided. Typhus, The greatest havoc was caused by typhus. Those who died from it were left unburied for days. One reason for this, as given to the writer by a superior Turkish officer, was to increase infection in order that there should be greater mortality among the living, The Armenians, however, can claim some revenge, for the plague naturally did not confine itself to Armenians only, and the whole country through which these refugees passed was devastated ; the writer saw dozens of villages in Syria empty of all inhabitants, killed off by typhus. No sanitary measures to combat the epidemic were taken. [898—20] D10 Property plundered. The Armenians were ordered from their homes at the shortest notice, and no time was given for them to provide transport for their belongings or to dispose of their property. The Turks took possession of all, and relieved the unfortunate people of such things as they attempted to carry with them. Lack of Road Transport. The demand for road transport became so great that prices ran to a prohibitive height. The writer saw thousands of Armenians piear Hassan Beylu, m the Taurus mountains, lying out in the snow waiting for vehicles, and the same state of things prevailed at Aleppo and other transfer stations. There was no organisation to meet the situation created by the forcible evacuation of the Armenian population, partly the result of Turkish incompetence and partly through deliberate neglect. Foreign Public Opinion. Jemal Pasha. , After a time European and more especially American public opinion began to be heard on the subject of Armenians, and upon this Jemal Pasha (the Great!) went to Constantinople and insisted that the massacres should cease, urging that it was not only a crime but a mistake. In addition he foresaw that a useful source of forced labour could be tapped for his public works in Syria and Palestine. It was reported that Talaat was not disposed at first to listen, but that Jemal was powerful enough to over ride opposition, and it is said that in this way the lives of over 100,000 Armenians were spared, but only on the condition that they should be sent to Syria. Jemal Pasha was promptly nicknamed the “ Armenian Pasha ” in Constantinople, but the Armenians were grateful and neutral Ambassadors were duly impressed. The Armenians, wishing to show their appreci ition of Jemal Pasha’s action, and being prohibited from uttering their thanks, decided to march past his house in Constantinople in silence, and in this manner 40,U00 Armenians paraded in front of Jemal, who' stood on the balcony of his house for three hours with his arms folded like Napoleon the Great. The train by which Jemal returned to Syria was frequently stopped for him to receive the thanks of Armenians, which, however, the writer thinks were given bv order ; in fact, the writer considers that the whole of Jemal’s action was a mere farce to impress the outside world and to increase the importance of Jemal. The treatment of the Armenians under Jemal’s administration confirms him in this opinion. The Armenians under Jemal. Jemal having thus got a large number of Armenians into his clutches, decided to send them to remote parts of Syria and Palestine. The writer considers that his motive for this action was to prevent them from contaminating the existing population, and also to minimise the chances of neutrals witnessing their treatment. They were sent to various camps where 3,000 to 5,0* 0 were herded together, and the writer visited such camps in Hauran, Adflun, and South East of the Dead Sea. Armenian Camps. The inmates of these camps are entirely dependent on food and water supplied by Government; they were forbidden to enter towns or villages, or to work for pay ; they are made to live in the desert. Men, women, and children were put to hard labour, and each working man or woman received 2d. a day. That was their sole income on which they had to live. In sonm cases there was no water nearer than six miles, and it had to be brought to the camp by rail. The trains frequently failed to run, the fact that there was a war in progress was a convenient excuse, and was made to cover deliberate neMect. The writer has seen an overdue train carrying water arrive. The Amenians, parched with thirst, rushed to the halting place, each carrying an earthen jar or tin. As soon as toe train stopped it was besieged by the mob, which was beaten back by the Tuikish guard with the butt end of their rifles. Having thrust the crowd back, all the taps of the tanks were then turned on and the water allowed to run to waste in full view of the hundreds who were dying for want of it. The Administration duly despatched watei to the desert; that was enough as far as Jemal Pasha and his friendswere concerned. An accident might have happened subsequently, but that was no fault or theirs. &amp;uch was the view taken of the above • incident by Jemal when he neaici &lt;&gt;i it 5 according to a report which reached the writer. ^ Tn ail 1 d 1 tS , lirst swept away half the numbers in these camps in a few weeks. ’ 086 at r e ^ ec a wretched existence; all family life had been broken up, husbands, wives, children had been separated, and there were no means of finding out what had become 01 those who were missing. Immorality flourished; sanitation in its most elementary form did not exist. -jJ 11 the meantlme Jeraal ^udlj proclaimed that he was colonising waste lands with thrilty Armenians, which was enough for the inspired press of the Central Powers to give out to the world that m the last two years Syria and Palestine, under Jemals administration, had flourished more than in the whole of the preceding fifty years. ^ A flat refusal was given to representatives of neutral countries who asked to go to Syria to witness the conditions under which the Armenians lived. Slave Markets. In the track of the Armenians, as they were driven along, female slave-markets were ^established.^ The price of an Armenian girl from 12 to 14 years of age was from 2 mejidiehs to £ T 1 . The writer saw such a market in Damascus, and he was told by his relatives in Aleppo and by American missionaries that thousands of young girls had been solo m open markets, ihe so-called intellectual leaders of the Moslem world, the Khojas, Ulemas, Padis, and Muftis, were not slow to avail themselves of the oppor tunities that these markets offered, and these frequently saved their pockets and increased the numbers of their slaves by claiming to have made converts, in which case no money transaction was demanded. Conversion to Islam. These alleged converts were usually young women who were driven into harems ostensibly for the purpose of being instructed in the “ true faith ” ! Conversion to Islam was attempted on a large scale, among men as well as women, and with some success amongst those Armenians from some parts of the Caucasus who had long practiced some Turkish customs, and whose belief in Christianity was not deeply rooted, but the writer knows of a number of educated and wealthy Armenians of Constantinople and the coast towns who have professed their conversion. The latter seem however to have taken this step in the hope of preserving at least some of their property from confiscation. Wholesale Massacres. So far a description has been given of the destruction of the Armenian nation by organised deportation accompanied by neglect and by the unchecked ravages of disease but in addition there is systematic butchery of men and boys. The usual method employed was to organise labour battalions in which boys and men were collected together and these were sent under a guard of about twenty Turkish soldiers to some out-of-the-w T ay place where no provision was made for rations or water. The • guard was given orders to use their rifles without hesitation in case of desertion, or any sign of mutiny, on the part of those put under their charge. After a day or two the guard would return alone. The story given was either the Armenians as a whole attempted to desert, or that there had been a mutiny and the guard in self defence had been compelled to kill the lot. The writer never witnessed such a scene himself but he had reports from trustworthy sources. One of his informants was an Armenian who speaking and dressing like a Turk had travelled from Armenia to Jaffa. There he mixed with a number of Turkish soldiers who had just executed the butchery of about 400 Armenians in the manner described above and who regaled him with many- repulsive details. This man on the following day came upon a heap of murdered Armenians, and journeying on to Aleppo he made a full report of his experience to the American consul there. German Opinion. The writer discussed these murders with German officers in Constantinople, and they admitted that unfortunately they were entirely true. [898—20] EArmenians in Constantinople, Orders were issued that only Armenians who haa been born in Constantinople should be allowed to remain there. This was a signal for a house-to-house search by the police as well as arrests in the open streets, ine witness has seen batches or Armenians being led through the streets, the victims of the zeal of the police m fulfilling this order. The raids are usually carried out at night, but he saw a wealthy and influential Armenian arrested in brpad daylight and hurried away. Nothing more is seen or heard of those whom the police take. Unfortunately there aie some Armenians who act as police spies, and sell their countrymen^ The writer can give details of hundreds of young Armenian girls who have become prostitutes in Constantinople, the only means left to them by which they can support their parents. One he quotes in particular, a well-bred girl recently married, whose husband was killed before her eyes, and who w T as driven to her present position only after months of struggling to live decently. The Massacres continue Lately there has not been so much heard of Armenian massacres, but they continue nevertheless; it is only that there are fewer means by which the outside world can hear of them. The writer considers that the reason for this treatment of the Armenians is that they are an easy prey, and that Mahommedans, rich or poor, high or low, are by nature wedded to murder and robbery. The Turk, in addition, is still an invader, who treats others under his power as subject races. The Armenians, morally and economically, are utterly ruined ; probably the most industrious and thrifty race (and it is a Jew who described them as such) in the Turkish Empire has ceased to exist. APPENDIX (B). Miscellaneoes Cuttings feom the Press. Russia's Intention regarding the Dardanelles. Paris, Tuesday. M. Milioukov, the eminent Bussian statesman, leader of the Cadets, and principal author of the fall of Sturmer, writes in the “ Journal ” :— The question of the Straits is for Bussia a powerful and vital question, and dominates at the present hour all others, as does that of hlsace and Lorraine for France. We do not consider the possession of the Straits as an annexation. Bussia with her immense territories has no need of new conquests, except as the logical and inevitable ending of her social and economic development. As a national and territorial organism Bussia is not complete, and can only be so the day the Dardanelles becomes an integral part of her Empire. T he infirmity from which our country has so much suffered, above all since the Berlin Congress, and which has cost us and our Allies painful deceptions and reverses in the course of this world war, must definitely disappear. Bussia’s sovereignty over the Straits does not mean that the Straits are going to be closed to free commerce. The regime of the Straits under Bussian domination should approximate sensibly to that now exercised over the Panama Canal, with, of course, this one difference, that its passage will be rigorously forbidden to the warships of other countries.— Exchange. The Bagdad Railway. T rom the “ Verarlberger Voiksblatt ” of the 26th November :— On the 21 st November the last tunnel through the Taurus (3,795 metres in length) was opened. Thus the connection of the already completed sections of the Baghdad Bail way is an accomplished fact. The boring operations lasted a year and a half. The transport ot troops, which had hitherto been effected by motor-cars over the mountain roads, is now far easier and more rapid.This is a truly great work, which will be much appreciated in peace time even by on present enemies; at present, however, it constates a menace for Russian and -Diitish aspirations m Mesopotamia. ^ Enemy Propaganda. . p Tne War Office “ Daily Review,” in its issue of the 8 th December, prints a nombei ot German wireless messages sent to America, among which is the following: — British Tyranny in Arabia. The newspaper “ Alhidschaz,” appearing in Medina, reports an interesting incident which occurred m Yambo. There an English officer used the minaret of the mosque as an observation post and the population demanded that he should leave the minaret, as his procedure would be a breach of the Mohammedan religion. He refused to comply and threatened to set fire to the village, saying, “ Yambo is English and nobody has a C u 1Yr ' n° /• n °t everi IT© feffierit Hussein.” The incident caused a great stir amongst the inhabitants, a portion of them leaving Yambo as a sign of their protest, and from the fear of what might happen il the guns of the fleet lying near there were turned on to the village. I he newspaper adds : “ If the English behave in this manner when they are in need of the Help ol feherif Hussein, what would they do if they were masters of the situation ? [“ Daily Review of the Foreign Press” (W.O.), 8 th December, 1916.] 2 . The Daily telegraph ’ of the 7th December publishes the following Turkish communique :— Constantinople (via Amsterdam), Tuesday. Caucasus and Persian Front. —Nothing of importance occurred. A British biplane was brought down by our fire on the Syrian coast, near Ilemble. The pilot and observer were taken prisoners. We prevented attempts by the enemy to land at Akaba, as well as an enemy endeavour to hoist the French flag on the coast of the Gulf of Akaba. The flag we captured. Our advance in the direction of Yambo and Hejaz continues.— Reuter. Lord Headley fined for being Drunk. When Lord Headley, aged 61, was charged at Tower Bridge Police Court on Saturday with having been drunk and disorderly at Waterloo Boad, a police constable said that after having been ejected from Waterloo Station he placed his arm round the neck of a woman. Lord Headley, who declined to take the oath, stating that he would swear “ on his honour as a peer of the realm,” said that he had been working on intricate calcula tions all the previous night and was very tired when he arrived at Waterloo. All that he had had to drink was two bottles of stout and a cup of coffee. He denied that he had put his arm round the woman’s neck. “ I may have so far forgotten myself as to try and kiss a pretty young woman,” he said, “ I have done it before ; but not an old frump, as they saj 7 this woman was.” The magistrate fined him 10 s. and ordered 20 s. of his bail to be estreated. Notice of appeal was given. [“ Daily Mail,” 11 th December.: N.B.—Lord Headley is one of the patrons of the Woking Mosque. In his defence he stated that he was interfered with while saying the Moslem sunset prayer. He was defended by an Indian Moslem barrister. More Young Turk Treachery. (From a correspondent.) Cairo, October 20. In a previous communication I referred to some important documents which prove that the Young Turks have been for years endeavouring to crush the Arab element in the Turkish Empire ; and that they have intriguedagainst the authority of the Grand Sherif. In this connection the following revelations, made by the Sherif in the course14 of a conversation with the editor of an Arabic paper who enjoys his Highness’s confidence, have recently been published. They are o± value as showing the patience displayed by the Grand Sherif in his dealings with his unscrupulous enemies. His remarks mav be translated as follows :— I would never believe, oh ! my son, before I succeeded to the Emirship of Mecca that the Unionists would go to the length of rekindling the embers of revolt, and making up mutual jealousies and rancour among the Arab tribes at a time when they were most in need of peace for the preservation of the Empire and the maintenance of the honour of the Faith. But they have actually done all this, and I acquainted you yesterday with part of what has been established by proof against them. I will now make further revelations, which will strike wonder in the world of Islam when the day comes for you to make them public. What has been ordained is bound to come to pass. When the Unionists realised the failure of their intrigues to create dissension between me and the Imam Yehya and El Idrissi, they resorted to another stratagem, which would have imperilled the Holy Provinces and have led to the ruin of their inhabitants, both men and women, were it not for a merciful Providence. To that end they actually sent delegates to Jeddah and Yambo, with careful instructions how to sow the seeds of revolt; and these had secret meetings with some of the tribal chiefs whom they sought to win over and incite to rebellion against me, in the name of the Faith, holding out to them fair promises m case of success in their evil mission, as they had actually done with the Imam Yehya and El Idrissi when they sought to cut off the communications between Jeddah and Mecca and between the latter town and Medina, and to plunder the caravans that follow those routes for purposes of trade and the Pilgrimage. It did not take long to kindle the flame of revolt in the breasts of the' tribal shaykhs, who were thus misled under the false pretence of protecting the Faith. Meantime, arms and ammunition were being prepared, and * trenches were dug clandestinely outside Jeddah, near the tomb ot our Mother Eve (May Allah’s favour rest on her !) ; and when they had completed their preparations they declared their well-known revolt, and closed the routes, killing thousands of people. Then they attacked Jeddah—not, however, before the inhabitants had closed its gates. The history of this revolt is common knowledge to all. When the sinister intelligence reached me, I sent word to the Emir of the tribes involved, asking him to sto|? this incursion, and quell the revolt among his men, promising him all that he might wish of silver and gold, if such were his object. But I asked him, if his revolt were determined by another motive, to postpone it until after the Pilgrimage—which was imminent when he could carry out his intentions. My request was unheeded, and he replied that nis sole motive was the Jjaith. diien it was that I sent out a force ofmv men under the leadership of my son, Sherif Faisal, who quelled the revolt, and killed, in the course of the battle, the Emir of these tribes. This, however, cost the blood of thousands of my men and his, and peace was ultimately concluded between us on certain conditions, one of which was that we should make common cause against the Unionists, if the reins of Government remained in thett hands and they persisted in their hostile intentions against the Arabs, especially as it was later discovered that becret agents of theirs had been trying to seduce the shaykhs of those tribes by deceitful promises, After the conclusion Oi peace these secret agents were caught in Jeddah, and were about to be killed, when I intervened and let them off, to go back whence they had come, penitent. This, my son, is a page of the full record of the Unionists’ intrigues, which history will recom to their eternal shame. Iheir only object in stirring up the Arab tribes was to fish in troubled waters after the fall of their Empire; then to carry out their evil intentions m the Holy Provinces, iy the name of the so-called Moslem Government forgetting that, by so doing, they are only combating Allah and His Prophet in thp person of the descendent of his Holy House. ^ After all this I might yet have borne with them had they finally acki that they were not Moslems. But, behold ! oh ye who have eyes' to see with I have had the calamity to deal! [The “ Near East,” 8th December, 1916.] mwledged what men PRINTED AT THE POREluN OFFICE 1&gt; A R.

One of these gendarmes confessed to killing 100 Armenian men himself on the various journeys he had taken. The Armenians were dying of typhus and dysentery, and the roads were littered with their decomposing bodies, The emptv desert cisterns and caves were also filled with coroses. Both 0 fti?ers agree that this was the most appalling state'of aiiairs, and tnat, unlsss it had been a matter of ocular demons orauion, it would be incrediole. The Turkish officers of tne battalion were^horrified at the sights they saw, and one regimental chaplain*, on coming across a number of bodies, dismounted his horse and publicly prayed that the Divine punisnment of these crimes should be averted from Moslems, ana, by way of expiation, himself worked at digging graves for trie dead bodies. When marching from Ras-ul-Ain to-Er-Radi the soldiers of the battalion often put up their hands to avert the sight of numerous bloated naked corpses of murdered women who lay by the roadside. Two sayings were common among the common soldiers: 'Ras-ul-Ain is a shambles' and 'ho man can ever think of a woman’s body except as a matter of horror, instead of attraction, after Ras-ul-Ain.' Ras-ul-Ain was used as a place of concentration for Armenians, and 12.000 was the number usually there. The average number of the incoming parties and outgoing parties (vis., those going to be murdered) cannot be estimated accurately. *A Moslem Divine.r SECRET. 51 41 l ' 1916 APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARABIAN REPORT No. X ^ General Situation in Hejaz. At TEIi a quiet and promising week, during which affairs were going well, the situation has once more become threatening, owing to Turkish activity. The telegram on p. 1 from the Sirdar deserves careful study. However, the interruption of the railway by our aeroplanes and general Arab activity must not be discounted. The presence of Jemal at Medina is perhaps explained by the general policy of hostility which has been adopted towards him by the Turkish Government. He may feel that it is up to him to do something, and may take some risks. Should matters become serious a further report will be prepared and circulated. F ren gh Co-operation . From, private sources it has been ascertained that until a day or two ago neither M. de France nor Colonel Bremond was acquainted with the purport of the Anglo- French Agreement in regard to the Arabic-speaking areas of the Ottoman Empire. This will explain certain views advanced by Colonel Bremond. However, the matter has been cleared up, and fuller co-operation may be expected in future. The Atrocities of the Turks at Alowli and Medina. The Sheriffs protest against the Turkish atrocities through the medium of his department for foreign affairs, seems to present an easy way of introducing the Sheriffs independence to the world at large by means of press communiques. It is suggested that should the Sheriffs position appear generally secure, in three or four weeks from now, it would be a good plan to begin making occasional communiques to the press, referring to his title and achievements. However, we should not introduce him to the public until he is firmly established, otherwise he may become another M. Yenizelos. Mesopotamia. The general sense of the telegrams from Mesopotamia is satisfactory, and exhibits an increasino* tendency to co-operation, and treatment of Arabian affairs on the basis of one general problem. Thus the Sirdar has obtained apologies to the Eastern chiefs of a very complete kind from the Sherif, while Sir Percy Cox has just completed arrange ments with the Anazeh, who are, properly speaking, Syrian Arabs, for interception of caravans. The Situation at Aden. The news from Aden is most interesting ; however, it is too early_ to give an oninion. If the Yemen Arabs rise against the Turks and establish an independent Government, we can at once recognise it, and so avoid much diplomatic complication [898 — 19]2 with Italy. It is further worth considering that if the Yemen Arabs dispose of the Turks in Yemen, the Turks in the Aden Hinterland will not be able to last out for long. The Turks are unable to communicate with Yemen owing to the action of the Sheri f. Tee Situation in Turkey. In the body of the report (on p. ), will be found an account of rumours of Enver Pasha’s visits to Abdul Hamid. It is possible the military pressure which has enforced the calling up of the Turkish intellectuals has brought about a considerable change in the political situation in Turkey, and that a split may result between Enver and Tala’at, and that Enver is looking about for political assets. Enver may, indeed, have designs upon the throne himself, having married a niece of Abdul Hamid. The extracts from the article by Dr. Wilhelm Feldman in the issue of the 2 nd November “Berliner Tageblatt ” is an interesting contribution. It is probably a mixture of fact and fiction, intended to support the great bluff regarding Turkish resources which the Germans have endeavoured to work on the Allies lately. As regards roads the account is probably true, and also as regards munition and other factories. The irrigation schemes are obviously reports of paper projects. As far as the scholastic and educational establishments are concerned, these statements are disposed of by the fact that all schools and universities are being closed to obtain men for service from the staffs. The remarks about women doing the men’s work amount to very little ; in many parts of Anatolia, notably Oastamuni, Angora, and Konia provinces, the women had to work before the present war, owing to the dearth of men. The reported friction between the Turks and Persians in Azerbaijan is all to the good, and the statement that the Turks fear to retreat is probably founded on fact ; the tribesmen are ready to attach themselves to an invader, but nevertheless turn and rend him if he retires. In 1906 Daghistani Pasha was forced to invade Persia from Kowanduz because the tribes had joined him, nor was he able to retire until a full division had reinforced him. M.

The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 57] on the 4th December a summary of recent news. A deserter stated that the Turkish forces at Ma’an and Ed-Dera’a had been reinforced from the Canal area. The lurks remained inactive. The Arabs were in good spirits ; they had had several successful skirmishes, raiding a convoy between Bir Derwish and Medina, and cutting Turkish communications between El Ala and ^Vbjh. However on the 6th December he (the Sirdar) telegraphed as follows “ [No. 61.] “Reports ol the 3rd December from Yenbo and Rabegh state that Djemal Pasha arrived at Medina lately, and Turks from Bir Abbas have occupied Hamra and Bir Said. “ Faisal’s plans against railway at Medain Salih and Wejh suspended on this account, and he and mam body of his Arabs have retired to a point 25 miles east of Yenbo. Turkish intentions are not clear, but it' Turks are prepared to take risks to their lines of communication by an advance on Yenbo or Rabegh local Arab forces at these places are incapable of resistance without assistance of regular troops.i :i 1 2 , M I H f&lt; “ Local Britisli officers are anxious regarding affair, but I await precise reports from them and Arab leaders before I can say whether Turkish threat is sufficiently grave to justify immediate consideration of emergency measures foreshadowed in my telegram No. 9 of the 7th November and my telegram No. 31 ot the 22 nd November. My opinion regarding desirability of preventing at all costs the capture of Eabegh by Turks is unchanged ; and if Turks advance in force immediately before organisation and training of local Arab forces and trained bands are ^ completed its capture can only be prevented by assistance of regular (British or French) troops. At both Babegh and Yen bo there are now considerable quantity of warlike stores and supplies for Sherif.” The Sirdar telegraphed again on the 5th December that Colonel Parker had reported from Babegh that 6 officers and 24 other Arab prisoners had volunteered for service with the Sherifs forces. lieport of the Arab Bureau. The Arab Bureau telegraphed [A.B. 337] on the 4 th December as follows Shaykh Hamed Ibn Bifada, of Billi bribe, in co-operation with a detach- ment from Feisal, has succeeded in cutting Turkish communications between Elala and Wejh, and capturing Turkish convoy of 70 camels. “ There is no definite news of Abdulla, who was last reported a fortnight ago on Eastern road, 4 days north of Mecca. Turks sent one battalion to Khank 40 miles E.S E. of Medina, and report, probably correct, states that this battalion las been badly cut up by Arabs, and lost one gun and three maxims. £C Three Turkish battalions on Derbelfura, furthest south being 20 miles south of Birelmash, which is their regimental headquarters : these battalions are suffering -- scurvy.

Feisal is optimistic, and, having postponed plan of advancino' to Wejh. proposes sending the camel corps at Eardas to cut the railway, and if Turks advance south, will himself go for Derbelfura. J At Medina, according to one report, the railway traffic has ceased.” The Sherif s Title. The Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 2 nh November in regard to the announcement in the “ Kibla.” suggesting that he should act as Sir H. McMahon had done.

Neither blame nor insult could be “attached” to persons of their ’gimv and importance, nor could he intentionally do anything- so contrary to all Arab traditions and manners. If then, he said, through distance or'the weakness of human nature there had been any misponception at a time when all their energies should be directed to the assertion of their independence, he was “ the sufferer and the aggrieved party. fie and they were friends and allies of the British Government, the powerful riend of the Arabs, and they should unite and co-operate one with the other to expel the iurkish tricksters, their personal enemies and the enemies of the truth, and to pin gw re co antry 10 m their vileness and iniquity ; that was the first necessity and everything else would follow. He had absolutely no personal ambition m the matter ; his object was to secure his safety and theirs and the integrity of the Arab country and its purification from the wickedness of the deceitful Turks who were the enemies of God. Protest against Turkish Cruelties. His Excellency Fuad El Katib, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca, tele graphed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 28th November, in regard to the cruelties of the Turks at Alawli and Medina. He said that they made a protest to the civilised world m the name of international law and of justice, against the band of unionists and their confederates, who had inflicted every kind of cruelty on the women and children of the innocent inhabitants of Alawli, and who were now renewing their refined cruelty at Medina, where they were condemning to penal servitude or tcTdeath by hanging innocent inhabitants of that place, and such of the inhabitants of Alwali as were stid alive. The report [“lEcho”j of these atrocities had been transmitted to the General of their Western Army (whose advance guard was in touch with the enemy) by a body of representatives chosen from all classes of the inhabitants met together to appeal for protection, against these atrocious and inhuman acts, to that Arab Government which had shown every regard for the Turkish prisoners of Eltaif, Wali commanders,’ officers, and soldiers, in spite of their misdeeds and of their having fireffthe houses of princes, notables, and others, after having pillaged them. The Arab Government, he said, had called the attention of the Secretary of State to this matter, that it might be held free from blame if it found itself obliged to make use of reprisals. The Sirdar, telegraphing on the 3rd December, said that this had been published in Khartum with good results, and he heard the same from Egypt. Last June a number of the Awali were massacred by the Turks at Medina, and it was reported that recently persons had been executed by the Turks. An Arab deputation from Medina had visited Faisal to protest against Turkish oppression and to implore the Sherif to hasten Arab assistance. Bank at Jeddah. The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 54] on the 3rd December that, in regard to the establishment of a bank at Jeddah [see Arabian Report, N.S., XIX, p. 6 ], Captain Lloyd had further suggested that we should encourage the British firm of Gellatly Hankey, already established at Jeddah, to extend their business so as to include banking; but that this should be done after some delay, to avoid offending French susceptibility. The Sirdar added that he thought the suggestion good, and capable of being carried out. Property of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration. The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 54] that he was instructing Colonel Wilson that, when he should see the Sherif, he should point out the inadvisability of his action in regard to the property of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, and endeavour to obtain further particulars.11 imww ■&gt;&lt;— nr** *- mm IBN SAUD.

Sir Percy Cox has sent the information that the Sultan of Maskat, in accordance with his promise, has removed his brother Saiyid Salim from the post o a i of Gwadur ; Saiyid Salim is a boy of 19, with a strong bias against Hindus. PART II. POLITICAL NOTES FROM THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. The Resident telegraphed on the 27th November [281 A. P.] that the Sherif had deputed an envoy to Aden who came with a letter from Colonel Wilson: he was formerly for sixteen years resident in Lahej, and a man of high repute. This envoy would despatch up-country the Sherif’s proclamation backed by the Sherif s sign manual; he was also writing letters to Imam Yahiya (through Idrisi) and to all friendly Arabs in the protectorate. The Resident had seen all the communications, and had permitted their despatch, as their object was the union of the Arab nation; the realisation, however, of the object would depend on British help in money, arms, and ammunition. In his weekly letter dated the 4th November, the Resident at Aden said that the Imam w r as still closely watching the struggle of the Turks in the Yemen, and had not yet shown his hand. He also said that the Upper Aulaki Sultan and the Upper Aulaki Shaykh (both stipendaries) had made a formal agreement with the Sultan of Lahej that they would concert with him against the Turks if the British moved out. The Resident telegraphed [282 A.P.] on the 4th December that, writing on the 16th October, the Imam Yahya said that he could not, as a good Moslem, break his pact with the Turks, whose attitude had been uniformly correct towards him. He said that he recognised the resources and might of the British Empire, but, rather than pose before the world as a traitor, be would lose many advantages. To build up the fortunes of Yemen, badly ravaged for many years past, was, he said, his immediate work. From four separate sources the Resident had learnt that the Imam’s son Mohammed had captured Al Rauda, Shuaib, and A1 Tawila, and had laid siege to Sana; his action was. believed to be anti-Turk, but, the Resident added, it might be that Imam Yahya was working by proxy. The Caucasus. On the 4th December the G.O.C. Force D telegraphed that on the 2 nd December tlm Minister at Tehran had wired that the Turks at Hamadan were very short of supplies, and that the health of the Turkish Army Corps there was not good. The Turkish Commander at Hamadan had spoken to Democrat Committee regarding the possibility of the retirement of his force. Such an idea was opposed by Democrat, and relations between the Turks and the people were strained, some chiefs threatening to attack the Turks if they retired. Lower- Mesopotamia, r I he G.O.O. force D telegraphed on the 4th December that it was reported that Saiyid Mahomet Ah Eazvini, religious leader at Hillah, was recently murdered by the Turks to the great indignation of the people; and that Saiyid MahometSSjebK thp ^ ^(Mashha Ali), was reported to have AH) and Kerbel- and the R ’ ''i'i t0 unlted the to '™speople of Najaf (Mashha from a Sle ^ w “tT? tnbe .*°, ,i 8 ht them - This news, which came that four influential Shavtlf Gener f ' 1 Staff, Basra, on the 3rd December, stating by seiZo- carava a Zfih J Z l a ? t ‘- Turk . had been urged to co-operate ' ' .

Afghan Gossip about the Sherif. I he British representative at Kandahar wrote, under date the 23rd September that there was “a lot of talk” there about the Sherif, and that, a few days previously’ there had been a rumour that he had been removed to Constantinople as a prisoner.’ u 16 ^ ie sa ^ a &gt; not believe the reports in the Indian newspapers regarding the Sherif; they said that he had no connection with any Christian Power and that he had sent one son to Egypt to fight for the Turks, and another to Mesopotamia. Enver Pasha. An agent reported under date the 25th November that the ex-Sultan, Abdul Hamid, had recently been frequently visited by Enver Pasha. Humour had it that the▼isits were in some way connected with Enver s designs to have himself placed on the throne. . Another agent, writing on the 28th November, however, said that a lecent arrival from Constantinople had reported that there were rumours to the effect that Enver, supported by the Germans, favoured the dissolution of the durkish parliament and constitution, and that the idea was to replace Abdul Hamid on the throne. Moslem Prisoners for the Turks. An agent has reported that the Turks have enrolled about 1,000 Mohammedan prisoners and were trying to get more. They are persuaded to join from religious motives and are promised good food, pay, and promotion. APPENDIX. Miscellaneous Cuttings and Notes from the Press. Turkish Provinces in War. The following extracts are taken from an article by Dr. Wilhelm Feldmann in the “Berliner Tageblatt” of the 2nd November ; it is dated from Constantinople :— “ . . . . All who have carefully studied the provincial press, or had oppor tunity of conversing with travellers, learn with surprise that an economic and intellectual activity reigns in the provinces quite independent of the capital. This activity made a timid first appearance after the Balkan war. But the revolution of thought brought about by the world war have endowed it with its first earnest significance. A noteworthy example of economic activity is shown in the fact that during the last month alone fifteen large Turkish commercial associations and limited companies were found in the provinces, while only a short time ago Turkish commercial associations were entirely lacking, both in the capital and in the provinces .... “ Djemal Pasha .... has fulfilled the promises be formerly made as Wall of Adana. New roads and railways have been built throughout the country which, though owing their origin to military necessity will be of the greatest importance in time of peace. Factories have been erected in every town which, though due to military needs will certainly outlast the war The latest and most important of his reforms is the employment of the uncultivated district between the vilayet of Aleppo and Bir-es-Saba. Last spring Djemal Pasha sent for a German expert .... to undertake the irrigation of this large strip of land. The district was once celebrated for its fruitfulness. The preparations for the long-planned irrigation of the Adana valley are now about to begin The irrigation of the Eski-Sheher valley was about to be undertaken An attempt to cultivate rice has been in the fields near Churma, part of the newly irrigated valley of Konia. That the intellectual side is not passed over in the midst of such material activity is shown by the founding of schools in Anatolia and Syria. .... T he most surprising of all the news from the Turkish provinces is that from Konia, which speaks of the coming erection of a monument in honour of the Turkish women who have replaced, in the fields, the men called up for military duty/’ J Americans detained hy Turkey. Washington, November 29. The United States Ambassador in Constantinople has informed the State Depart ment that Turkey cannot permit several hundred Americans, native and naturalised, to leave Turkey via Jaffa, owing to military necessity. In rescinding its previous consent to permit the departure of these Americans, Turkey says that the official who entered into the agreement had no authority to do so. The Government is greatly irritated bv this information.— Beuter.

Sir R. Wingate, telegraphing on the 22 nd November [No. 29], said that he had had an opportunity of discussing the situation with an intelligent and influential Sudanese who was sent to Mecca by Sir Said Ali El Murghani as his delegate, and in addition had received private letters from Colonel Wilson. He gathered from both that one of the Sherif s principal objects in declaring himself an independent King was to counteract propaganda sedulously introduced by C.U.P. leaders that he was nothing more than a dupe of the British 'Government, to which he had practically sold Hejaz. The Sherif admitted that to some extent this was credited by some of his own loyal tribes. From the same source probably comes the information given by Captain Lawrence when he was in Khartum, and in warning us of the danger of landing —181 BI ' 2 / Christian troops in any large numbers in Hejaz he is probably right. He, Sir R. Wingate, also concurred in this view. He wished, he said, once more to place the true situation before the Secretary of State so far as he was able to gauge it, now fully confirmed by the information received from Colonels Wilson and Parker, and from Sir Said’s delegate, who was admitted to the closest confidence of the Sherif and of his son Abdulla. 1 . The Sherif has definitely burnt his boats with the C.U.P., and can be trusted to be loyal to the Arab cause and to the Allies. 2 . Though the Arabs are really keen to see the Sherif’s cause triumph, and though they hate the Turks, they are very susceptible to propaganda against Christians. The C.U.P. threatens that they will fall under Christian yoke ; rather than this they would prefer to remain under Turkish domination, with all its misgovernment, tyranny, and oppression. Therefore the more the Allies can support the Sherif’s claims to inde pendent sovereignty, and the more they can publicly proclaim their territorial disinterestedness in Hejaz, the more likely is the Sherif to gain the solid adherence of the tribes and to defeat the ends of the C.U.P., which is incessantly working from Medina to undermine his cause. In this connection, Sir R. Wingate said that he was under the impression that the views of the French were slightly divergent on one point from the British. We should welcome the capture of Medina by the Sherif, but the French seem to regard with some alarm, in view of their future Syrian policy, the great increase of strength which the. Sherif’s cause would immediately obtain by the active support of all Arab tribes in the Syrian hinterland, they having sworn to rise in aid of the Sherif directly he obtains possession of Medina. 3. The policy of assisting the Sherif with money, supplies, stores, instructors, airships, &amp;c., which we have adopted, is quite sound and is producing an excellent effect. The presence of a Christian technical staff seems to be understood and is warmly welcomed; the most fanatical of the Sherif’s adherents realises that it is only thus that they can fight, with any chance of success, against well-armed Turkish regulars. 4. The above facts were present in the Sirdar’s mind when making his recom mendations, and Captain Lawrence’s views have not modified the carefully considered plans elaborated in telegram No. 9 of the 7 th November [see Arabian Report XVII, N.S , p. 2], which was concurred in by both Admiral Wemvss and Captain Lawrence when they discussed the situation with him. in Khartum. 5. To avoid misunderstanding, Sir R. Wingate repeated those views as briefly as possible :— (a.) That the Sherif’s cause should not be allowed to fail is a matter of vital importance to the Allies and to the British Empire. (b.) Ihe Sherif’s position has been considerably consolidated by the support already given. (c.) r ! he present policy is sound in refusing to land any large bodies of Christian troops at Rabegh. More mobile artillery is required, and this can be supplied by the French ; Colonel Bremond, however, is opposed to sending it to Rabegh without a supporting force of practically a brigade of artillerw (d.) It is obvious that the holding of Rabegh and making it the base for the Sherif s trained bands is strategically important, and already some progress has been made on these lines; but,'in the event of a determined Turkish advance, the impossibility of holding it without the support of a British or French brigade is admitted. (e.) It is to U hoped that the presence at Rabegh of warships and airships, and the activity there, together with the exaggerated reports which these steps will initiate, may have the effect, if not of actually preventing, at any rate of delaying an advance in force of the enemy (already hampered by difficulties of transport and supply), and so give more time to the Sherif to organise his forces and undertake that independent action against the Turks which is so desirable. _ More time wouM also be given to the G.O.C.-in-C. in Egypt to organise his offensive from Sinai which, being a direct menace to the Heiaz , rai . W1 ' be of the greatest value to the Sherif’s movement (./) a, with a view of recapturing the Holy Places, the Turks do advance south ti om Medina, that advance should be opposed by throwing British or French troops into Rabegh, but it is clearly desirable that such action should be delayed as long as possible. This might make us too late, hence the r.3 proposal that arrangements should be made for the withdrawal of European and Egyptian personnel, now there, on board steamers. If our intelligence and airships clearly indicate that the Turks intend an advance in force then every effort should be made to stop it. In the recent scare, and in face of s ^ K ' defeat which threatened him, the Sherif threw religious scruples to the winds, implored our assistance, and begged that British troops might be landed at Babegh ; should a serious advance take place, a similar situation woula undoubtedly arise, if the Sheriffs preparations for resistance were not sufnciently advanced to give him reasonable hope of success. (g.) dor these reasons Sir R. Wingate repeats his carefully-considered opinion that, until the true facts of the enemy’s situation and intentions are clearer, no brigade, French or British, should be sent to Rabegh, though preparations should be made for an emeroenev. O ./ Sir R. TV ingate added that he fully understood and sympathised with the views of Sir W. Robertson and Sir A. Murray that to detach the troops required for aU emergency (which may not arise) from his already depleted forces would seriously interfere with the latters Sinai plans; it would therefore simplify the situation, and would also satisfy the Sherif, if it were possible for the French infantry force recom mended by Colonel Bremond to be collected at Suez and kept there pending develop ments. If this plan is unfeasible, for political or military reasons, or if the French Government will not allow their artillery and machine-gun units now at Suez to proceed to Rabegh without infantry support, Sir R. Wingate says he must carry on as best he can on the present lines; but if, owing to emergency preparations being impossible, the Sherif’s movement should unfortunately collapse, he must ask to be absolved from responsibility. He suggested that this telegram should be shown to Sir W. Robertson, and added that since drafting it he had received the full text of Captain Lawrence’s report, wLich gave him no reason for altering the views herein expressed. On the following day Sir R. Wingate telegraphed additions [No. 32]. Colonel Wilson sent an extract from a letter, dated the 6 th November, from Faisal to the Sherif: “ Safeguard Rabegh and the road to Mecca, O master of favours.” Also an extract from a. letter, dated the 8 th November, in which Colonel Parker said that the presence of one singular regular brigade at Rabegh would absolutely safeguard the situation at that place and the Arab cause ; but if the Arabs are to be left to hold it unaided against a serious advance, should this come about, the risks would be very grave. Captain Lawrence s Report. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs telegraphed [No. 18] to the Sirdar on the 20 th November in regard to this report [see Arabian Report XIX, p. 8 ] asking him :— 1 . Whether he endorsed Captain Lawrence’s views; 2 . Whether Captain Lawrence’s objections would be equally applicable to a French Algerian force officered by Christians ; 3. Whether he would recommend that French troops should be brought to Port Sudan or to Suez, there to await the request of the Sherif for their despatch to Rabegh ; and 4. Assuming that British troops were not to be employed in Hejaz, what was his opinion as co the employment of French ? The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 311 his reply on the 22 nd November. In regard to the first question he said that the views of Captain Lawrence were those which he had expressed at Khartum when he was there with Admiral Wemyss, and he, the Sirdar, concurred in them generally. But when be had put to Captain Lawrence the con tingency of a Turkish advance in force on Rabegh, and the possibility of arresting this by a brigade of French or British troops urgently summoned by the Sherif, he under stood him to agree that this help would be welcomed by the Arabs, who, despite their religious obiections. would cling to this hope of success rather than acquiesce in the certain defeat which the failure to hold Rabegh would involve. Colonels Wilson and Parker, who are on the spot, whose knowledge of Arabs is considerable, and who have had much war experience, 'proposed the emergency measures which he, the Sirdar, advocated in his telegram of the 12 th November to the C.I.G.S. ; and they are ofopinion that Rabegh could and should be held if there were a Turkish advance in force. The Sirdar concurred in the reason which Captain Lawrence gave for Colonel Bremond’s attitude; he had just returned from Rabegh, and was of opinion that four batteries and six French battalions would be required for its defence. As to the second question, the Sherif would prefer British to French troops, but^ if Briti h are not available [ ? he would gladly], in the great emergency foreshadowed, accept an offer of the others. This occurred during the previous scare of an advance, when he was told definitely that British would not be landed in Hejaz, but that he was free to accept any offer of assistance made by the French. The Sirdar considered that, should a like emergency again arise, we should not be justified in advising him to refuse French help. The Sherif was well aware that the troops must be accompanied by Christian officers and personnel ; he had no objection to their presence in the coast towns, but he would rightly object to their march inland, on the grounds Captain Lawrence had so clearly indicated. It was on this understanding that all plans for training the Sheriffs levies had been based, and the Sirdar still hoped that the French would be induced to send their batteries and machine guns irom Suez to Rabegh ; for, when the training of the Arab personnel had been completed, they would be urgently required by Faisal, Ali, and Abdulla. In reply to the third question, he said that if French infantry could be spared to meet the possible emergency of a Turkish advance on Rabegh he should certainly recommend its despatch to buez, there to await the Sheriffs call; but if their presence in other theatres of war made this impossible, he still urged that their guns and machine guns should be sent to Rabegh, whence (If on the advance of the enemy it were decided to evacuate the place) the French personnel could by removed. In regard to the fourth question, he said that he fully understood the objections to landing British troops in Hejaz in view of the importance of the operations against the Hejaz railway which Sir A. Murray was initiating from Sinai, and also on account Indian susceptibilities. For those reasons, as well as for those indicated in the reply to the second question, he recommended the despatch of French troops in an emergency, as he was of the opinion that they might avert the complete collapse of the Sherif’s movement, which he understood was the main object of His Majesty’s Government. French Guns for the Sherif. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 24th November [No. 35 j that Colonel Bremond had informed him that the French Government intended to put the two batteries now at Suez at the Sheriffs disposal and in addition six mountain guns 80-mm. calibre, with harness and munitions but without personnel. He hoped that a message of thanks would he sent to the French Government, and that the guns might be despatched to Rabegh at an early date. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs telegraphed to Lord Bertie [No. 2738] on the 27th November asking him to thank the French Government and to urge the early despatch of these guns to Rabegh. Turkish Force in Hejaz. IXM.L, Egypt, telegraphed to D.M.I. [LA. 2645] on the 21 st November that as a result of information from a very reliable source he was led to believe that the total Turkish forces in Hejaz of all arms and services amount roughlv to 12,000 men. This was advanced from a certain statement in regard to supply. And on the following day a further telegram [LA. 2648] added that it was indicated, by further information received from an absolutely reliable source, that the Turks were finding the supply of their forces in Hejaz a matter of difficulty and that they had had to draw on their : reserves in the local supply depot at Medina. Hejaz Railway. Specially made bombs have been dropped with good result on the Hejaz railway at five points in the vicinity of Maan : with the bombs propaganda papers were dropped. Ill-treatment of the People of Medina by the Turks. The Force I) weekly summary No. 85, dated the 16th October, says : “The O.P.O. forwards a letter from Ibn Saud received by him and acknowledging receipt of a letter from the Viceroy. He mentions having had newsof barbarous behaviour on Medina, which he says has to the Sherif’ s cause.” r ^ T7 part of the Turks towards the townspeople of the effect of detaching certain tribes from the Turks X The Sherif and the Shaykhs. , : he ^ 3rd NovemberBir A. Hirtzekcalled the attention of the Under-Secretary ' oi State tor foreign Affairs to three telegrams, all dated the 21 st November, which had een received from Sir Percy Cox, then at Koweyt with the Shuykh of that place, the Shavkh of Mohammerah, and Ibn Saud. Two of these [T 56 and T 58] are reproduced at length further on, under the heading « Ibn Saud ” ; the third [T 57 ] is to the following e ect. Some weeks ago the Shaykhs of Koweyt and Mohammerah sent congratulatory etters to tne Sherif. The SheriPs letters in reply had just reached Basra, and at the request of the Shaykh of Mohammerah, he, Sir P. Cox, had instructed his deputy to open one of them and telegraph its purport. He replied that the Sherif’s letter was a formal acknowledgment of che Shaykh s, couched, so far as he could judge, in a patronising and oil-hand style; that the Siiaykh’s name was on the envelope, but in the letter the place for it was left blank, as if it was a carelessly despatched circular ; and that the letter to the Shaykh of Koweyt was no doubt identical. Sir Percy Cox adds that sucii lack of courtesy could do no good to the Sherif’s cause lor] ours, and he hoped that he would be given a hint to mend his ways. In regard to these telegrams, Sir A. Hirtzel. wrote as follows :— “ Mr. Cnamberlain has no desire to suggest any unnecessary interference with the Grand Sherif m the internal affairs of his ‘kingdom’; but he would urge strongly that, in view of the very satisfactory attitude of those three Shaykhs (one of whom is a Persian subject and not directly concerned), it should be represented to the Sherif that his own interests, no less than courtesy to the British Govern ment, require him to meet the advances of their allies with civilitv, and even with cordiality. His Majesty’s Government are using all their influence to secure the cordial co-operation of all Arabs with the Sherif, but their efforts will be of no avail if the Sherif himself repels those whom the British Government have attracted to his support.” The Sirdar telegraphed on the 22 nd November that he had sent the same instructions in regard to Sir P. Cox’s telegram T. 57, as he had already sent in regard to T. 56. [See p. 7.] On the 25th November the Foreign Office telegraphed to the Sirdar [No. 24] that he should instruct Colonel Wilson to tell the Sherif personally on the telephone that His Majesty’s Government had learnt with great regret that the Shaykhs of Moham merah and Koweyt and Ibn Saud, three great Arab chiefs, had reason to feel aggrieved at the reception of their advances by the Sherif. His Majesty’s Government was convinced that such an incident was'entirely contrary to the intentions and washes of the Sherif himself, and that it was no doubt due to an oversight on the part of his subordinates, but, in view of the very satisfactory attitude of these three shaykhs, it must observe that the Sherif’s own interests, no less than courtesy towards His Majesty’s Government, require him to meet the advances of the King’s allies with civility and even with cordiality. His Majesty’s Government was using all its influence to secure the cordial co-operation of all Arabs with the Sherif, but its efforts would be of no avail if the Sherif himself repelled those wKom His Majesty’s Government had attracted to his support. The Sherif s Title. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 1026] on the 21 st November that no mention had yet been allowed in the press of the Sherif’s new title, but the fact was now common knowledge, and No. 22 of the Mecca newspaper, the “ Kibla,” had recently arrived, giving in well-expressed language full. details of the terms in which Ulema, notables, and people of Mecca had petitioned the Sherif to accept the kingship and in which he accepted the title. The Sirdar agreed with him that it was advisable to* permit the entry and circulation of that number of the “ Kibla ” as being the best way of publishing the news; it obviated the need of a communique and relieved us of responsibility for the terms in which it was made known. To delay publication would give rise to question and possibly resentment. He therefore proposed to release this number of the “ Kibia,” and said he should be glad to know as soon as possible if there: were any objection to his so doing. ■ [898—18] CMr. Dering telegraphed from Bangkok on the 24th November [No. 17Ij that the “Siam Observer” had published a telegram to the Siamese Government from the Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs announcing that the Sherif had been nominated King of the Arabian nation. The reply of the Siamese Minister conveying congratulations was also published. r Official Reply to the Sherif. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs telegraphed to the Sirdar on the 23rd November No. 21 ] that, the Tiussian Government having concurred, he might authorise Colonel Wilson to reply to the Sherif in the terms of his previous telegrams, * Nos. 6 and 13. It had been already intimated to the Sirdar on the 16th November [No. 17 j that he need not telegraph the final text of the reply. The combined effect of the two telegrams, 6 and 13, was that the reply should be in the following form :— V 1. The Sherif’s attention should be called to the inopportuneness of his announce- i( , ment of assumption of the royal style. 2. The Allies are unable to recognise the assumption by him of any sovereign title which might provoke disunion among the Arabs, though they will continue to regard him as the titular head of the populations of Arabia, and are glad to recognise him as the lawful and dc facto ruler of Hejaz. 3. The reply might conclude by congratulating the/Arab race on the efforts it is making, and by expressing the determination of His Majesty’s Government and its Allies to assist by all means in their power the securing and maintenance of its independence. The Sirdar telegraphed on the 25th November [No. 42] that he had received the joint views of Colonels Wilson and Brdmond, and had in consequence made some minor textual alterations ; he was sending the final Arabic text to Colonel Wilson on the 30th November. Colonel Bremond being at present in Egypt, and the Sirdar not knowing when he returned to Jeddah, he, the Sirdar, asked for instructions as to whether Colonel Wilson should present the note when he received it, or whether he should await Colonel Bremond’s return. Arab Prisoners from Russia. Major Thornhill telegraphed on the 22nd November to D.M.I. that the Russian General Staff had given orders on the 27th October for the despatch of the Arab officers. [See Arabian Report, XVIII, N.S., p. 3.] Arab Prisoners from India. The Viceroy telegraphed to the Sirdar on the 23rd November that the Arab prisoners left Bombay on the 21 st November. It was, he said, reported that many officers and men showed extreme reluctance to go, and some, fearing that they would be handed over to tiie Sherif and compelled to fight for him, had to be embarked by force. They had been assured that they would not be forced to fight against their fellow-countrymen either for the Sherif or for anyone else. This promise was made in the name of the Commander-in-Chief, who regards it as a personal pledge which he asks may be scrupulously fulfilled : he would like an assurance that this point will not be overlooked. The Bank at Jeddah. The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 38] on the 25th November that, after consultation with Colonel Wilson, Captain George Lloyd had informed him by telegram that he was confirmed in his already expressed opinion in regard to this subject, and that he hoped that the proposal to establish the Ottoman Bank or a French bank under a different name would not be sanctioned. Colonel Wilson concurred in the above, and both were agreed that 'there was scope for a British bank if this could be arranged. Colonel Wilson pointed out that Colonel Bremond’s action appeared to go beyond the objects of the French mission, as laid down in August last, and that should a French or semi-French bank be established in Hejaz at the present juncture it would give the French an economic and political hold in an area in which it was understood that British influence wasto be paramount^ He thought, however, that the proposition could be negatived without causing friction, and recommended that His Majesty’s Government should take a firm line in the matter. (•) Greek War Materiel for the Sherif. ^The birdar telegraphed [No. 41] on the 25th November asking whether it would be possible to obtain for the Arabs some of the war material demanded by Admiral Fournet at Athens. Congratulations from the Sherif. The Sirdar telegraphed on the 21 st November that the Sherif had asked him to convey his sincere congratulations to the British Government on the recent success of the British arms in France ; and on the 23rd the Foreign Office requested [No. 22 ] the Sirdar to convey a suitable message of thanks from His Majesty’s Government to the Sherif. Colonel Cadi at Rabegh. The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 33] on the 23rd November that H.M.S. “ Minerva ’ had reported by wireless on the previous day from Rabegh that Colonel Cadi, an Algerian Arab officer of the French army, had landed on the 19th and hoisted the French Hag, which, however, he had hauled down when requested to do so by an Arab officer. IBN SAUI) AND KOWEYT. Sir Percy Cox telegraphed | T. 56] on the 21 st November that he was at Koweyt with Ibn Saud and the Shaykhs of Koweyt and Mohammerah. He said that after discussion with Ibn Saud at Ojair he had reported that any effective co-operation on his part in Hejaz was impracticable. Ibn Saud, however, was prepared, if we and the Sherif considered that it would be helpful, to send one of his sons or other near relation, accompanied by about fifty followers, as a token of his identification with the cause of the Sherif; he would, however, like the Sherif to make a friendly request to this effect. He made this condition because he was, not without reason, extremely bitter against the Sherif personally, though he was ready to sink his personal differences in view of the common cause. Sir Percy Cox added that it would be remembered that eighteen months ago, when Ibn Saud was engaged in suppressing the rebellious Ajman tribesmen, Abdalla made an incursion into Qasim and made difficulties for Ibn Saud there. And quite recently, when Ibn Saud wrote to the Sherif expressing his readiness to co-operate, but asking for assurances of immunity from interference in the future, the Sherif replied by returning his letter and its enclosure with an arrogant and discourteous covering note, which Ibn Saud passed on to Sir Percy Cox. Ibn Saud felt very strongly in regard to this : it could only be obliterated by blood. The Sirdar telegraphed on the 22nd November saying that he had repeated this telegram to Colonel Wilson and had asked him to discuss the matter with the Sherif with the view of inducing him to send a conciliatory message to Ibn Saud at once. Sir Percy Cox sent a second telegram [T. 58] on the 21 st November saying that Ibn Saud had arrived at Koweyt on the evening of the 20 th on board H.M.S. “Juno.” A “ durbar ” had been held at the Sherif’s residence, at which were present Ibn Saud, the Shaykhs of Koweyt and Mohammerah, and about 200 others made up of principal inhabitants and some Bedouin headmen. After the delivery of the decoration [see Arabian Report N.S. XVIII, p. 9] Ibn Saud and the shaykhs vied with each other in expressing their enthusiasm and their attachment to Great Britain, the lead being given by the Shaykh of Mohammerah. Pie was followed by Ibn Saud, who gradually warmed to his work and delivered an animated speech, citing and dwelling upon the iniquities committed against other Moslems by the Turks, who, he said, were outside the pale of Islam. He went on to contrast our policy with that of the Turks; the latter continually tried to disintegrate the Arabs and foment their differences, whilst we encouraged them to unite for the common good. He eulogised the action of the Sherif and urged the obligation of all true Arabs to supply [? support] him. Finally, Sir Percy Cox says, the three swore to work together with us for the achievement of the common end. The Sirdar telegraphed on the 24th November that he had instructed Colonel Wilson to communicate such passages as he might consider desirable of Sir P. Cox’stelegram relating to this meeting to the Sherif, who, he was confident, would be much gratified. Sir Percy Cox telegraphed on the 26th November, saying that he suggested that we should give Ibn Saud until further notice a monthly assurance of 5,Q00L, together with 3,000 rifles and ammunition and four machine guns. Though the military result off his co-operation may not amount to much, the value of his moral co-operation is very considerable, and, compared to what should be given by us to Sherif and by Turks to Ibn Has hid, the measure of support proposed appears moderate, and Sir P. Cox trusted that it would be accepted. Ibn Saud had asked him to lay the following before the Government :— In his fight with Ibn Pashid, in which Captain Shakespear was killed, he lost enormously in rifles and material looted than after the collision. Before he could recover from this, Turks and Ibn Rashid set tine Ajman against him, and he had a difficult time with them. Since then protraction of war lias made his position with his tribesmen still more difficult. Their main normal source of income is the camel trade with Syria, and they resent stoppage of this, and wish they were not in the opposite camp to the Turks. They are still loyal to himself, but being weak from a military point of view, he has had the trouble of doing much more than usual in order to keep them so. He was very grateful for the 20,000L given him last year, and for 1,000 rifles, but former was mostly spent forthwith in liquidating debts, while he utilised the latter to arm his permanent guards for protection of his towns. Conditions being as above, he has not been in a position to give much military co-operation without being financed and assisted with arms. Short of this, however, he submits that he has done all that he can in the way of moral co-operation. Thus he has arrested Bin Faraoon, and handed his camels over to us ; he has identified himself most publicly with us by his visit to Koweyt and Basra, and pronouncement he made there. In the direction of munitions, he asks for 3,000 rifles and some machine guns with necessary ammunition. In the matter of money, he states that with the high prices now prevailing, and the cost of transport, they will cost 1 rupee per day per man to maintain in the field, and leaves it to us to give him such monthlv subsidy as we feel able. On conclusion of his visit here, be will return at once to Riadh, and is prepared instantaneously to proceed to Qasim, where, if assisted, he will maintain 4,000 men under arms to be employed under himself and his brother and son. If Ibn Rashid moves towards Irak in force be will move up parallel with him towards Zobeyr, and join up with our friendly tribes, and with a force from Koweyt. During visit here he will warn Shaykhs of our combine, who are here to meet him, that if Ibn Rashid threatens them in strength he will move up in their support. If Ibn Rashid remains in Hail, Ibn Saud will remain at Qasim, and harass or attack him as opportunity offers. PABT II. POLITICAL NOTES FROM THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Mesopotamia. Major Rowlandson telegraphed to D.M.I. on the 22 nd November that an escaped prisoner had given the following information in regard to Turkish recruiting. About the 31st August the Turks took all the men in Bagdad from 16 to 50. In October they unsuccessfully tried to rouse the Kurds for the defence of Diarbekr, but Rashid Beg, a Kurd chief, joined them at Bitlis. In August he said supplies were very scarce in Bagdad. . PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. Sayid Mustapha El Idrisi. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 1031] on the 23rd November that Sayid Mustapha El Idrisi was then in Cairo, and seemed to think that his services as inter mediary between Aden and Idrisi had not been recognised to the same extent as thoseof his brother Sayid Mohammed Sherif, who had been employed in negotiations with benussi. Sir H. McMahon understood that Mustapha had rendered loyal and valuable sei vices. There was no doubt that his influence with Idrisi had smoothed over the Comfida incident, and his services would, in the future, doubtless be called upon for similar work. I he most; acceptable form of reward, Sir II. McMahon thought, would be a free grant of land in Egypt, and a suitable plot could be obtained for about £3,000. The Sirdar telegraphed [No. 36] on the 24th November that he desired to associate himself warmly with this proposal; and on the same day the Resident at Aden telegraphed [280 A.P.j that he heartily supported the recommendation for a reward to Sayid Mustapha, who had done excellent work for the Residency. Syria, An agent reports that Jemal Pasha has come to an understanding with the Hauran Druses, he having relieved them of all military service and taxation, and authorised them to refuse to accept paper money of any value. Suggested Increase of Egyptian Army. The Foreign Office telegraphed to the Sirdar [No 23] on the 24th November, requesting him to consider the feasibility of increasing the Egyptian army. Report of the Arab Bureau for October. The Report says that the staff of the Bureau has been considerably increased, and that it has been possible to reorganise the office with a view to undertaking more work of a general and particular character. Lieutenant-Commander Hogarth, R.N.V.R., has been engaged upon the editing of a portfolio on Arabian Personalities and the preparation of the Arab Bulletin, besides acting in an advisory capacity. He is also seeing the Yemen Handbook through the press, and will undertake the collection of all Hejaz information for the second edition of the Hejaz Handbook. Lieutenant the Hon. E. Fielding, R.N.Y.R., has under taken duty with the Bureau, and is making a special study of Abyssinia and the adjacent countries. Second-Lieutenant Lawrence is to make propaganda his special domain. The economic possibilities of Arabia are receiving more attention, and it is hoped that Captain George Lloyd, M.P., will be placed at the disposal of the Bureau for the purpose. APPENDIX (A). Translation of a Letter from the Chief Political Officer to Emir Abdul- Aziz-al-Faisal-al-Saud, dated Basra, October 18, 1916. A/C. Except for my letter of the 29th August, 1916, asking you to co-operate in the matter of the purchase, of camels, it is a considerable time since I have been able to write to your Excellency ; on the other hand, since my last lengthy communication, I have received several welcome letters from yourself. In them you have touched on a number of subjects ; with most of which I can deal more conveniently in separate communications. I propose to confine this particular letter to the most important subject which you have discussed, viz., the rising of the Sherif Husain and his operations against the Turks in Hejaz. You have written on this subject in your letters of the 18th Ramazan ( 20 th July), 15th Shawwal (15th August), and 4th Dhil-qadah (3rd September). Inthe first letter you reminded me of your past relations with the Sherif, and told me what you feared his designs might be now, that is to say, you anticipated that he might have some intention of interfering in Nejd as he had done before, and you asked me to communicate your views and fears to His Majesty’s Government. In your second letter- you wrote to say that you had received letters from the Sherif, asking you to unite yourself with him and to render him assistance, and you continued that, pending your learning the views of the British Government, you had replied to the Sherif that if he was sincere in his intentions towards you, he should first give you a solemn undertaking [898—18] D10 to abstain in future from all intrusion within your limits and among your tribes. , You wrote that you would communicate again with me when you received his reply. Lastly, I have your letter of the 3rd September in which you explained that you 'would like to be informed whether the question oi co-operation with the Sherif, or of attacking Ibn Rashid, was considered by us to be merely a matter of the internal politics ot the Arab Chiefs, or whether they were questions in which the interests of the British Government were also involved. I have thought it convenient thus to summarise your Excellency’s letters, so that your enquiries could be more clearly answered. On receipt ol your communications, I referred to my Government as you desired me, and oecause it was not possible for me to give you the authority to answer without doing so, there lias been as a result some delny in the communication of this reply to your Excellency. The result of my reference is this : — As regards the Sherii’s intentions, His Majesty’s Government, according to the information and knowledge which they possess, have no reason whatever to think that he has any evil intention against your tribes or your territories. On the contrary, his Excellency regards your Excellency as his triend and coadjutor ; and as for ourselves vis-d-vis yourself and the Sherif, have we not our treaty with you, in article 1 of which we have recognised you as independent ruler of your territories of Nejd ? Of course, the Sherif must naturally recognise this treaty also, and His Majesty’s Government would by no means support him in any other attitude towards you. As to the question of co-operation with the Sherif, or abstention from co-operation, and your enquiry as to whether this is a matter of the politics of the Arabs, or whether the interests of the British Government are also involved, I will try to make the position clear to you. It is not hidden from you that in the first instance, Great Britain had no wish to go to war with Turkey; but it became necessary simply because Turkey fell under the control of Germany, who thrust her into hostilities with us. But when by decree of fate a state of war arose, the British Government said to themselves : “ Now that the Turks have gratuitously plunged into war with us, we will have no more of them, and we will do our best to expel them from Iraq and Arabia, so that in future we_ may be immune from the results of their intrigues and maLdministration and m order that the rulers and the tubes of the Arabs may gain freedom from such a tyrannical Government, and achieve a prosperous future.” You will see, therefore, that it is the object and interest of the British Government to expel the Tuiks from Arabia. A'ou will agree also that it is to the vital interest of your Excellency, and of the Sherif, and of the other great leaders of the Arab countries and tribes, to expiel the l urks. ! hus the object of the British Government and the object of the Chiefs of the Arab States are one and the same ; and it is therefore in the interest of us all that there should be co-operation between all, so that the common object may be realised. It is for these reasons that the British Government greatly desire the success of the Sherif. and regard it as highly desirable and most important that you should co-operate with him to the utmost ot your power. It is not hidden »rom you that your name carries a great prestige among the Arabs, and, according to my information, many of the Shaykhs are only waiting to see what your attirude is before deciding upon their own. If they hear that Ibn Sa’ud is openly suppoiting and helping the Sherd, they will quickly take up arms in his behalf- but if, on the other hand, they hear that Ibn Sa’ud is standing aloof, they also will stand aloof. You w ill see, therefore, how important it is that you should make it clear to the Arab public that you, the Ruler of Nejd, are in sympathy with the Sherif and are assisting him to expel the Turks from Arabia. As to how you can best do that, whether by helping him with money and men or bv attacking Ibn Rashid, or by winning the latter over to your side, this is a question which you can best decide for yourself. His Majesty’s Government do not wish to press you to do this or to do that; all they wish you to understand is that your open support, whether it be moral or active, will be of great advantage to the Sherifs cause ana to the common object. You know best how you can most profitably assist the feherif without serious prejudice to important interests of your own. In short, I am sure you will realise from the above that it is of the highest importance that not only the British Government, but all the Chiefs of Arabs like yourself, whose present and future interests demand expulsion of the Turks from Arabia should at this time concentrate their resources and energies on the achievement of tha^ common object. Compared with that great object, all other objects and interests become for the present insignificant, and need to be deferred until the main object is11 achieved (such for instance, as the matter of the Ajman, about which I will write to you separately). This letter lias assumed such length that I will leave discussion of the other matters for another letter which I will send vi4 Bahrein in a few davs’ time. As regards the general war, things are going very well indeed with the Allies in &gt;Burope : 'Roumania has joined us, and Greece has joined, and the Allies’ armies are gradually closing on the enemy from all sides. Here in Iraq, owing to the great heat and the long line of communications, no active operations have been goino- on for some weeks, hut now the conditions are changing: the weather is getting cold, and the water will soon rise, and our forces m Mesopotamia are much superior to the enemy But the actual operations are conducted in accordance with the general plan prescribed in the councils of the Allies in Europe, so that it is not in my power to sav that we are going to advance on this date or on that date, or in this direction or in that .direction. But this you may know, that all is going thoroughly well with us, and (incidentally) there are signs that many of the small tribes around Nasirivah, who have been endeavouring to annoy us in small matters at the instigation of 'the Turks, have got tired of the deceptions and false promises of emissaries like Mizhar Pasha, and are inclined to ask our forgiveness and seek friendship with us. I do not wish to trouble you more for the present, for this is sufficiently long. Another letter will follow in a few days’ time. May you be preserved and Salam. APPENDIX (B). Miscellaneous Cuttings and Notes from the Press. Big lunnel on Bagdad Railway Pierced. (From our Correspondent.) Amsterdam, November 23, 1916. A telegram from Sophia reports that the tunnel through the Taurus Range was completed on the 15th November. This was the last big obstacle to the completion of the Bagdad Railway. The piercing of the Taurus Range begins at Karapunar, and proceeds through the mountains as far as Dorak by a series of tunnels connected by heavy embankments a distance of about 20 miles, of which about 11 miles consist of tunnels. The tunnel, 3 miles long, through the Amanus Range, farther south, was completed last year. [The “Times,” 24th November, 1916.] 5,000 Armenians Massacred. Petrograd, November 23, 1916. According to despatches to the newspapers from Baku, the Turks have massacred 5,000 of the 6,000 Armenians at Sivas, in Anatolia.— Reuter. [Ibid.] Starving Syrians: Poet asks the King of Spain to Intervene. Paris, Saturday. The “ Matin ” publishes a letter from the Syrian poet, Chekri Ganem, addressed to the King of Spain, urging the King to intervene on behalf of the Syrian population. He says :— “ In spite of the considerable quantity of provisions available, the Syrian population is condemned to die of hunger. Already 150,000 have succumbed. Djemal .Pasha is allowing the food supplies to rot rather than let the starving population eat. This is an attempt at deliberate extermination of the whole innocent population.” Chekri Ganem adds that he is aware that there are numerous international and diplomatic obstacles of every kind in the way of any action by His Majesty, but believes that they are not insurmountable if the King of Spain should decide to intervene.— Reuter. [The “Globe,” 25th November, 1916.]12 Russia and Armenia. The 'October number of “ Armenia,” a monthly Armenian review published in Italian at Turin, has an article under this heading. The writer thereof reproduces in full and deals with an article published on the 10th August last in the Russian news-^ paper “ Retch,” headed c£ The Colonisation of Turkish Armenia.” The article in “Armenia” is very decidedly anti-Russian, the writer urging that under the rules made by Russia for the colonisation of Armenia, the Armenians will be no better off than they were under the Turks. There are to be Russian colonists and Cossack colonists, but no Armenian may return to Armenia unless he can produce documentary evidence of his title to land. The writer in £C Armenia” sums up the situation by saying that if the article in “ Retch ’ be correct, the Russian authorities have taken all necessary measures to make the Turkish project of exterminating the Armenians a reality, at any rate in certain districts. The only way by which an Armenian can re-enter into the possession of his belongings is to prove his right by contracts of purchase or other documents. Of the contracts nothing, not even the ghost, remains in Turkish Armenia, and the number of those who could preserve documents when it was a question of saving their life would be few indeed ; whilst the children and relations of those who were massacred, who were out of Turkey at the time, are by that fact alone deprived of every right, there not even being left to them the theoretical possibility of putting forward documents. “ La Lettura ” and the Arabian Revolt. In the November number of “ La Lettura,” a magazine published in Milan in connection with the “ Corriere della Sera ” newspaper, there is an article on the Arabian revolt by Professor Eugenio Griffin, who begins by saying that all news of the Sherifs revolt comes from English sources. The Arab revolt, he goes on to say, is an expression embracing various separatist movements in a fictitious unity, though there is no cohesion between them. The writer is of opinion that the advantages that England and her Allies will gain from the insurrection will depend largely on the propaganda of the pilgrims after their return home, and that will be a propaganda of hostility against the irreligious Young-Turk-German Government.SECRET. APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARABIAN REPORT No. XVIII General Situation. IF the Arab Bureau’s telegram No. A.B. 229 is accurate, the whole situation in . Jaz lb r, ™ : i ea . sier &gt; and the Arabs appear to be reassembling in a satisfactory manner. One point, however, which requires attention is the question of future co-operation between the French and British on the spot; it would appear advisable before any question of rivalry arises, that both should be urged to adopt a mutual attitude of the utmost frankness, as otherwise the path of both Arabs, British, and t rench is beset with a number of unavoidable temptations ; for instance, the request of the bheril for one tanner and two gardeners from Algeria, viewed in one light, mi'lit appear to be “the thin edge of the wedge,” the first step towards French domina- ion, &amp;c., yet, if looked at without any dark suspicion, is merely the sort of demand that Oriental potentates suddenly make when ordinary conversation begins to flag. The Pilgrimage. Now that the French pilgrimage is safely home, it is to be hoped that full publicity will be given to the success ot the whole affair. From private sources it appears that the Algerians were highly delighted with the treatment accorded them. Officers’ Reports. The reports of Captains Bray and Lawrence deserve close and careful reading. Captain Lawrence’s statement in regard to the French attitude to the Arabs, and his reference to their larger schemes of policy, must be the result of some misunder standing, either by Captain Lawrence of the French, or by the French officers of their own Government’s intentions, as it seems in no way to fit in with anything said or thought here or in Paris. Last week I saw Colonel Chardigny, since gone to the Caucasus, who was engaged in the Hejaz work in Paris, and certainly he spoke as if the French military view was that every use should be made of every Arab who would serve our purpose. Aden. Colonel Jacob’s comments, though brief, are of the very greatest importance. He gives a clear view of the state of affairs which prevails in the Aden Hinterland. The Sultan of Egypt. The sentence of death passed on the Sultan of Egypt by a court-martial in Aleppo is of sinister import, and, if taken in connection with the Islam Kultur Society’s proceedings, may be the forerunner of another attempt upon his life. [898 — 17]2 The Dardanelles. The attitude of the Turkish Government in repudiating the Treaties of Berlin and Paris is an indication of the increasing conceit which the lurks have of themselves. This pride, the natural result of their Generals’ successes^ over the Britisn, may act to the disadvantage of the Turks, as the contempt in which they now hold us ma\ lead them to take risks. The “Near East” (Newspaper). Attention is drawn to Part III. The reference in the “Near East” to Puiad Island endangers the lives of many innocent people. The Bed Crescent. The picture of the dead ambulance camel in the “ Daily Mail is another example of unconscious enemy propaganda. The photograph will probably be used to justify the torpedoing of a hospital ship or some other outrage when the occasion arises. M.

The reinforcements— 1 , 000 — 2 , 000 —recently sent from Mecca to Rabegh have arrived at latter place, as well as a battery of field guns and one howitzer battery from Egypt- ' r . ^ „ The Arab Bureau reports [A.B. 229] that the Sherif’s forces are again in movement, as there is very little activity on the part of the Turks. Abdulla left Mecca in the direction of Medina on the’ 12 th November by the eastern road, with ten guns, three machine guns, and a considerable force. He expects to collect a force as he three machine guns, and a considerable force. He expects to collect a force as he goes along, including a contingent from Nejd (one group), and hopes thus to assemble 10,000 men. 898—17] BOn the 15th November Sherif Zeid left Rabegh to join Faisal at Hamra with 500 camel corps. The brother of Sheikh Hussein Mubeiriq has come into .Rabegh, and the only son of the latter is said to be coming. Sherif Ali has sent to Bir Hosani, on Sultani road, an advanced post of (500 men. Faisal’s force is in good heart; there are several Billi Shaykhs with him, and Faisa^ hopes confidently to win over this tribe to Sherif shortly. As soon as guns are received he contemplates an early move north. A representative of Nuri Shalan recently with Faisal is expected to return from Jauf in a fortnight. The Sirdar s Position. On the 9th November Sir H. McMahon repeated to the Foreign Office [No. 99ii] a telegram which he had sent to the Sirdar saying that it appeared that the time had come when it would simplify matters if he assumed full political direction of the Arab question, and asking whether he concurred. Sir R. Wingate expressed his concurrence on the following day in a telegram which he repeated to the Foreign Office. As Sir H. McMahon had desired he undertook to repeat all telegrams and correspondence for his information; and added that he should consult the High Commissioner on doubtful points, and should always be very grateful for any comments or views he might be good enough to express. The Sirdar s Plans. These, as detailed in the last report, have been approved, as also his proposal to have a British military mission at Rabegh, which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his telegram to the Sirdar intimating this approval on the 9th November [No. 9] said “ will be able to keep us more accurately informed regarding the situation, as at present we get the most contradictory reports.” The Secretary of State also said that reports said that, owing to ignorance, much of the material we are supplying is wasted, particularly machine guns. He suggested that it might be possible to provide some trained Indian Mohammedan personnel for machine guns and mountain guns. With the resources in Mohammedan personnel at our disposal, even if the Sudan cannot assist, and with the assistance the French have offered, it should, Viscount Grey thinks, be possible to provide the Sherif with the backing he requires. French Assistance. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed [No. 15] on the 11 th November that he had informed Colonel Bremond, through Colonel Wilson, of the decision that the French contingent with' machine-gun companies might proceed to Rabegh. Colonel Bremond replied that he had telegraphed to Captain Boucher at Suez to have the machine-guns ready for immediate embarkation—there should now be sixteen of them ; he had also telegraphed to Colonel Cadi to come to Rabegh from Mecca to take command. Sir R. Wingate 'then asked Colonel Bremond to instruct Captain Boucher to embark the machine-guns and despatch them to Rabegh. The Admiral would inform him as to the proposed measures^ in regtrd to water supply, as to which he had inquired; and he, the Sirdar, was sending an experienced British medical officer and a small staff But on the 11th November the French Ambassador left a note at the Foreign Office in which it was pointed out that there had been a misunderstanding. The French Government was ready to collaborate to the utmost possible in providing for the security of the Sherit ; but the first necessity was lor England to land a brigade of infantry at Rabegh, and the French Government was not disposed to send its technical contingent till this had been done. Offer of Senegalese Troops. . 0n the Hth November the Foreign Office telegraphed [No. U] to the Sirdar saying that the French Government had offered to place two battalions of Senegalese troops now at Jibouhi at the disposal of His Majesty’s Government in order to facilitate the despatch to Rabegh of an infantry contingent. The War Committee suggested that they might be utilised in the Sudan, and thus release two Sudanese battalions for service at Rabegh. To this the Sirdar replied on the following dav [No. 16] that the doing this would not be understood in the Sudan and would create a feeling of unrest. Moreover, theAttitude of the French Government. &lt; ' L) rh fi.rh1 1 ret u kr troo 8 s 0t 3,16 Satisfied ° f the nlabi % of the Sherif’s army to / \ r HT T7t ^ ^ &lt;7 -L-L v. , (5. ; The lurkish attack, if there is to be one, cannot be long delayed : the autumn m -, ,-v i /. ycu. . one ttutumu ^ be utdised for the purpose. ( 6 .) 1 he British Government cannot conceal from itself the grave consequences which a check of the Arab movement would produce in its Moslem posses sions as much as in those of France. If the Sherif fails, Moslems throughout the world will compare the poorness of o m support with the vigour of that given by Germany to the Turks. (7.) In conclusion, the French Ambassador urged the grave responsibility the British Government would incur if it refused to do what was held to be necessary by all those who had studied the question on the snot. Application by Sherif to French Government for certain Moslems. The French charge d’affaires informed the Foreign Office on the 6 th November that his Government had been requested by the Sherif to furnish him with three Moslems capable of directing the cultivation of the Mecca valley, and of founding a tannery for the utilisation of the skins of the thousands of beasts sacrificed on Arafat. Ihe Foreign Office replied that His Majesty’s Government saw no objection to a favourable reply being returned. On the 6 th November the.Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Viceroy that there was no objection to the Arab prisoners in India being sent to Egypt via Babegli to give them an opportunity of offering their services to the Sherif. The D.M.I. telegraphed on the 26th 03tober that we should be grateful to the Bussian General Staff if it would allow four Arab prisoners to proceed to England at once in plain clothes. The British consul should be asked to make arrangements and to telegraph the probable date of arrival, that they might be met. Lord Bertie telegraphed [No. 1180] on the 10 th November saying that Ben Ghabrit, the Moslem leader of the French pilgrimage, had been seen by M. Gout. This person, who is regarded with great confidence by the French Government, expressed great anxiety as to the situation; he feared that, unless sufficient help were sent speedily, the Sherif would treat with the Turks if he considered himself in danger, d he Sherif appears to have spoken freely with him and to have given him the impression that he, the Sherif, was convinced that the Turks would jump at any peace proposals and give him all he wanted. Arab Prisoners from India. Ai^ab Prisoners from Russia. The Sherif s Loyalty.4 Sir H. Wingate telegraphed [No. 21 ] on the 14th November that Ben Ghabrits view was shared by Colonel Bremond, and in some measure supported by the report of Buhi Effendi on his visit to Mecca. Colonel Wilson, on the other hand, had not the slightest doubt as to the Sherif’s sincerity or of his loyalty to us, and he, the Sirdar, - agreed with Colonel Wilson. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 15th November [No. 1012 ] that, in his opinion, the Sherifs assumption of the kingly title was a conclusive reply to any question of his alleged readiness to make terms with Turkey. His own information was totally opposed to any such idea. Ben Ghabrit, on his return to Cairo, had given Sir H. McMahon the impression that he had “ an ulterior motive” in some of his views on Hejaz affairs. The Sherifs Title. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 8 th November [No. 983] that the Serbian Government had telegraphed on the 6 th November to the Sherif formally recognising his title; and that the Italian Government had telegraphed thanking Abdulla for his communication and saying that it proposed sending a special envoy shortly. Both telegrams had been held up. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 5th November that Abdulla’s telegram to the Amir informing him of fact had been held up at Peshawur ; but apparently the one to Bangkok had got through. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 8 th November [No. 984] that Colonel Wilson had received from Abdulla an acknowledgment of the congratulations sent to the Sherif; in his communication it was mentioned that His Majesty’s Government had once addressed the Sherif as Caliph. Enquiries were made as to when this was done, and on the 10 th November the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 12 ] that Abdulla had stated to Colonel Wilson that no letter was ever addressed to the Sherif as Caliph, but that in a letter from Cairo the phrase occurred, “We hope that Caliph maybe in your noble household.” Sir H. McMahon telegraphed | No. 1004] on the 13th November that this could only refer to a message from Lord Kitchener in October 1914, which concluded with the words, “ It may be an Arab of the race will ; ssume the Caliphate at Mecca or Medina, and so good may come, by help of God, out of all evil which is now occurring .’ 5 As to the title which should be recognised, the Foreign Office telegraphed to the Sirdar on the 6th November [No. 6| that the Sherif should be informed as follows: His Majesty’s Government and the Governments of France and Bussia, though they are glad to recognise the Sherif as the lawful and de facto ruler of Hejaz, and though they regard and will continue to regard him as the titular head of the Arab peoples in their revolt against Turkish misrule, are unable to recognise the assumption by him of any sovereign title which might at the present moment provoke disunion among the Arabs. It should also be urgently brought to the Sherifs attention that in its English and French equivalents the title assumed by him appears to be national and not territorial, and that His Majesty’s Government had taken note of the declaration by the Sherif himself that Ibn Sand and Saiyid Idris “ ruled their own country ” and that he had “ no intention of interfering with them.” It should also be strongly impressed on the Sherif that the question of the Caliphate should be left open until the end of the war. Sir H. McMahon in a telegram [No. 991] despatched on the 9 th November expressed the opinion that the term “titular head of the Arab peoples” might be misunderstood, and suggested the substitution of “ champion of peoples of Arabia.” The Pilgrimage. , Sir H. McMahon has inquired as to the time having arrived for an official communique in regard to the success of the pilgrimage. Applications for British Protection for Families in Jeddah. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 995] on the 10th November that he had been consulted as to applications which had been made by families of Egyptian or Indian origin settled in Hejaz—one of them an Egyptian family which settled there 250 years ago. Experience in Egypt, he said, was conclusive as to the unwisdom of encouragingekmis^ to exceptional treatment of families of foreign origin who had abandoned oil lh Bnult^fdb fough, of courseflndiaf famiHes who have retard tnui Kriush nationality are entitled to British protection. _ Uaims of Egyptian merchants who can establish that they have not severed 1011 h b ?ypt are • he 0nly Aptian claims that we should press, and retime a PP areilt tor protecting other Ottomans who do not accept the new e^nrtttn ay ^ Iatei ' S!r H ' McMahon telegraphed [No. 1001] that the Sirdar had expressed bis concurrence. The Bank at Jeddah. Ihie French Charge d’Affaires left a note at the Foreign Office on the 6th November suggesting thiit the branch of the Ottoman Bank at Jeddah should be transformed into an autonomous bank. A reply was given to the effect that His Mffiesty’s t()\ eiminnt cad not consider that the position in Hejaz was yet sufficiently secure to warrant the establishment there of a foreign bank, more especially in view of the suspicions with which any banking institution is regarded by Arab opinion. ^ [Several pages or telegrams have come on this subject, but, having regard to this re P y&gt; tt hardly seems worth while to reproduce them.] Report on the Situation in Hejaz by Captain N. N. E. Bray, King George's Own Lancers. [The following report, oated the 8th November, 1916, was made by Captain Bray at the request of the Secretary of State for India.] Before actually giving my appreciation of things military and political in Hejaz, 1 feel bound to preface it by these few observations :— First .—J hat I fully realise the great responsibilty I incur in expressing my own personal opinions and that they are so expressed only after the most earnest consideration and the most careful observation of events as I had opportunities to study them. Secondly .—-That the lack of really valuable and authentic information forces me to base many of my conclusions on my own slight military training and experience and the small knowledge I have of the characteristics of the two opposing forces in which we are interested. Lastly .—That it is now over three weeks since I was in Hejaz, and that, therefore, events may have materially changed, though from the reports I have seen they do not appear to have done so to any extent. The Military Situation as regards the Turks. We can, I think, safely assume that the Turks have for offensive purposes, at or near Medina, a full division. From information received, which appears fairly reliable, they have already a large number of machine guns, and there is a prospect of then- receiving more. In addition, they have for the support of this force about twenty-eight mountain guns, sixteen.of which are of an old pattern. They appear also to have collected a large number of camels, and to be buying and requisitioning more. We can assume, therefore, that their transport will be mostly camel. They have, however, in Medina four-wheeled country carts drawn by mules or camels. However, whatever the nature of their transport may be. it will be considerable in quantity, in order to supply the needs of a division, and slow moving. This is an important point to remember when reports are received of long and sudden advances on the part of the Turks. For reconnaissance work, they have three aeroplanes, and in place of cavalry, camel squadrons. It would, I think, be unwise to wholly exclude the possibility of held guns accompanying this column, especially when we remember the attempts against the Canal. We know they possess wireless at Medina ; we must not therefore lose sight of the possibility of their taking a wireless set with them. Quite separate from this force we have to reckon with the possible help they will receive from Arabs friendly to them or bribed by them to assist in the venture. I am quite'unable to say what their numbers moy be, but they will be well armed and mobile, and wall be used as a screen to keep off or delay the Sheriffs forces. Such, then, is an estimation of the Turks’ offensive power. For defensive purposes they have at least another division of mixed troops for the protection of Medina, supported by held and mountain artillery. [898—17] ' CThe Turkish Objective. The immediate Turkish objective is, of course, Mecca, but their ultimate objective is far wider in scope and of vaster importance than the mere occupation of the holy city. It is of the utmost importance that we should verv briefly study this aspect, since the whole Turkish plan will be based on the following considerations:— p' Politically. —The Turks cannot afford to lose control of the holy places ; to do so would be to abandon, or at any rate subordinate, their hitherto vast influence over Mohammedan peoples. Materially. —They cannot countenance the loss of so great a territory. Militarily. —From a defensive point of view they run grave risk of bringing in against them large forces, and for the protection of Syria and Mesopotamia they must crush the movement. From an offensive standpoint the movement prevents them using from two to three divisions in other spheres, eliminates the proposed preaching of a “Jehad,” dislocates their plans for fostering unrest in Africa and India, and bars their road to Aden. There are other considerations of equal importance which it is not necessary to mention here, but the points mentioned are of sufficient importance in themselves to convince us that the Turks will, if they possibly can, make a serious attempt to restore the situation. We have estimated, as far as our uncertain information goes, the weapon they possess to do it, and we must next consider how they may possibly employ the means at their disposal. To their advantage they have (a) an organised, disciplined, and well-led force of hard-nitting power; (b) they have a single purpose, a derinite policy, and a clear objective as against the dissensions of the Arab tribes; (c) they have the choice of time and direction, in other words, the initiative ; (d) the influence of their victories, real or supposed, in other spheres to pacify tribes who would otherwise be openly hostile. Against them they have (a) a long, arduous road through hostile country suited to Arab tactics ; (b) the great difficulties of transport and water ; (c) a brave, hardy, mobile, and bitterly hostile people ; (d) British sea-power and assistance ; (e) when once (if they are able) they have reached Mecca they have 250 miles of communications to keep open through hostile country; (/) a long vulnerable line of railway which has been cut twice and is a constant source of anxiety to them. lo carry out their plan, therefore, they need the most careful preparations. These are likely to be of the following nature :— They will naturally advance their base or starting point as far to the south of Medina as possible, to shorten their line of advance and give their force a maximum of supplies, io save time and so cut dowm transport. They will not move till thev are ready in every detail. YY hen they do move we may expect them to move with the greatest speed possible, ^ which will not be great if they have camels. They will, I feel convinced, move self-contained, by which I mean they will not leave posts alono’ tneu route. I must confess I am rather alone in this idea ; its importance is so threat that I must explain my reasons for my conclusions. To leave posts along a broad ^50 miles in length m hostile coautry would necessitate (a) their being strong to resist attack ; ( 6 ) fairly close together to allow supplies to be distributed; fc) organised for defensive purposes. From the point of view of wastage alone 1 do not see the possibility of the Turks doing so. I consider that if they move they will move in tue gieatest possible strength at the greatest possible speed straight for Mecca. Having arrived, by wholesale hangings and terrorism they will try to subdue the movement by fear and terrible punishments to any opposition. They will reward and bribe those tribes friendly to them, and by moving south from Medina and north from Mecca maintain touch. We may safely conclude that their preparations will be very thorough, and that they will not move till they have every possible chance of success, ' The Military Situation as regards the Arabs. Ihe Arab forces are at present organised into three groups :— The Northern group under Faisal, about 5,000 strong. Ihe Central group under Ali, from 2,000 to 5,000 strono-, Ihe Southern group under Abdulla, about 5,000 strong, &amp;7 Ihese numbers are purely “ conjectured,” since they vary in strength from time to if they about d t ay fl°| d t ay ' ^ ^ ^ , r e '* Uy ° f ex Pansion, especially nnmhJrof -fl * o? fig ^ t , an engagement. Their numbers likewise depend on the 350 AnbofWr Wh ' C , h we 1 0a “ them ' They are strengthened bv about ^itht cert!?n a ? d m ® n p brou ? ht h ' om India by four batteries of Mountain Artillery / * I ntrtam number of Egyptian gunners and a fair number of machine guns. I came omtl 6 °f nCinS10n tha , t the tl ‘ ree bror , her ? preferred to keep their commands separated Ir ? r le n®°ne o prestige, partly for territorial reasons, and partly on account of sma l animosities amongst their dtfferent followers This, however, does not mean they would not concentrate against Medina, bat simply that if p-ssible they prefer to act i, pendenth t wou 1 ul , be as wel1 to consider here their strength and weakness, what they are capable or, and what we cannot expect them to undertake. Fust then, as to their leaders. Faisal is a capable, trustwon by leader, of undoubted abiuty—ol nervous,yestiess disposition, and a strong desire to go to the Syrian sphere, ^F e . ie ^ believe Ins influence is great. Ali is no soldier, nor does he care for militaiy a airs -y - 6 18 ^ politician. ^ Abdulla, whom I did not meet, is reported to be the most fv e °r ? ' 5 j n r ^ s a so ^ r ^ er an( ^ politician. Their followers are brave, hardv, and bitterly hate the lurk; they appear to lie good natural shots, and can and will tmht exceedingly well under conditions to which they are accustomed. The forces are mobile and self-contained. Their strong points are night fighting and guerrilla fightim- at both of which they excel. They are greatly impressed by 'artillery, both for and against them, but this does not mean they will run away when shelled; they put up a good fight at Bir Darwesh in August against artillery, according to Turkish 'prisoners I interviewed taken in this fighting. We cannot expect them, fthink, to hold entrench ments, especially under artillery fire. Aeroplanes for or against them impress them immensely. Their leaders are very impressed by victory or defeat; apt to rather magnify ooth. All these points aie of importance when we come to consider our own action in conjunction with theirs. Their ideas of tactics and strategy are of the simplest kind. 1 considered All and Faisal both very friendly to ourselves, especially the latter, and they are certainly both men of integrity. Apart from these forces, which 1 have put at a minimum, and which might be considerably mcieased, we have to consider that there are a large number &lt;&gt;i tribesmen now silting on the fence who would, after a real success or a good prospect of it, double or treble their numbers, as a reverse would bring these clans in against them. Such, then, are the two contending forces. We must next consider the country. The country favours the Arab forces as much as it increases the difficulties of the Turks. The pilgrim road to Mecca is through hilly and rocky country most difficult to negotiate, most suitable for Arab tactics, and has a bad water supply. The Sultani road is difficult till it debouches on to the plains, where it is fairly easy to traverse. It has numerous wells. I am told that during the rains it is also quite feasible for the Turks to use the eastern road. The shortest and best road is the “Sultani,” but Babegh bars it. The Objectives of the Arabs. As the Turkish objective is Mecca so the Arab objective is Medina, and the capture of this city would have fur the Arabs an even greater result than the capture of Mecca by the Turks. They have as a further and ultimate objective Syria, and undoubtedly the fall of Medina would facilitate the conquest of the former, since so many elements there are hostile to the Turks. To carry out their objective they have the forces we have enumerated ; in addition, they have the aid of Asaaf and his Arabs as a constant menace against the Hejaz railway. The Arab forces are far more powerful than at first appears. They are gradually becoming more efficient, by their actions against their enemy, by the arms we are supplying, and the further military support we propose to give them. At their own tactics they are a force to be taken very seriously. The most important factor to notice is that they do not need communications as we apply the term to our own forces. If they feel they are seriously threatened they retire rapidly and appear again at another place where the terms are more favourable. There is therefore no chance of the Turks being able to surround them or of our going to their rescue. The most the Turks,, under the most favourable circumstances, can expect to do is to inflict casualties and disperse them. Given a rallying point they will appear again as strong as ever. Their “ supply ” needs are very small comparatively, their mobility great, the country no pbstacle, the climate no drawback as it is to their opponents.—— 8 t I would estimate their weak points and their immediate needs as follows : First’ I they want guiding as to their plans, and they should be given a clear and definite role* At present they appear to me too haphazard, and since the situation is now as important to us as to them, we might endeavour to control them more, and we have every right to do so. Secondly, they require light artillery both to give them striking power and monf* support ; the latter point is one of great importance. Thirdly, they require men who understand machine guns. Lastly, for division purposes they should have a cipable officer with them who can give us reliable and useful information on improved system of c immunication. Aeroplanes for observation purposes, offensive power, and moral support. The best way to upset the Turkish plans is to give the Arab forces liberty of action and offensive power. If the railway is seriously cut and kept cut, the Turks will be very chary of sending their force towards Mecca By seriously threatening Medina by means of the concentration of all the Arab forces they will pin the Turks to their base. To sum up, therefore, the situation is as follows :—The Turks are apparently preparing to mike a descent on Mecca; their difficulties are very great, the risks enormous. They rely on moral effect and drastic action to crush the revolt. The Arabs have really cleared the country from Medina to Mecca ; they have no definite, well-thought-out plan of action. Being of volatile natures, a sudden disaster as the capture of Mecca by the Turks would, unless we supported them in another direction, have a most disastrous effect. Babegh is the key to the situation. Given a firm hold there, we can deny the Sultani road to the Turks’ advance. If they should reach Mecca by an inland road it affords a new base to the Arabs on which they can rally. From here midway between the two cities Ahey can threaten the communications of the Turks, who will run grave risks of their division sharing the fate of their other forces. We can support the Arabs in this the worst contingency, and keep up their spirits and hopes, and the situation is net lost. It affords an outward and visible sign of our support. For offensive purposes it is highly important, affording an advance base, leaves the Arab forces free to concentrate on Medina in their maximum strength, which is the best means of frustrating the Turkish plan. 'the Arab leaders should, however, be counselled not to fight a general action with ti.e Turks, which would be playing into their hands. As regards The landing of Europeans at Babegh, I do not think there would be any grave objection, especially if our reasons were fully explained, and it the Arabs really thought they were in grave danger they would ask for any troops we could possibly spare. We have, ourselves, rather stimulated the objections to such action. The Syrian officers are jealous of our control. We should take firmer measures and insist on our line of action. Finally, I am convinced the Arab leaders are earnest in their endeavours and sincere in their friendship to ourselves. (Signed) Norman N. E Bray, Captain. Report by Captain Lawrence, of Intelligence Staff, Cairo. [Sent by G.O.C -in-G, Egypt, to D.M.I., md dated November 17, 1916 (LA. 2629).] As the towns in Hejaz are an agglomeration of foreign settlers they do not support (he Sherd’s movement, since the Hejaz revolt is supremely Arab. All the forces fighting for the Sherit are made up of tribesmen, and it is the tribal army 3,000 to 4,000 strong, under Sidi Faisal, in the Yenbo-Kheif-Bir Ibn Hassani Massif of tribes that has held up the advance on. Mecca or Babegh of Faktelegri Pasha’s army fbi five months. Babegh is not and never has been defensible with' Arab forces, and the Turks have not got there because these hill tribes under Faisal bar their way. If the hill tribes yield the Turks need not look for any further opposition to their advance until neai Mecca itself. 1 his situation aiiects our consideration of the scheme to land an Allied force at Babegh ; so long as the tribes hold out such a force is not necessary. If the tribes give way the Turks will reach Babegh in about four days. This does not give time foi the collection, embarkation, transport, disembarkation, and preparation of a position for a British force to hold the front of 6,000 yards of the pMm grove at Babegh. The British force therefore must arrive at Babegh while the tribes 'are still resisting the lurks if it is to get there in time. At present the tribes, opinion isf ° Ur t r r T f° 0d f J' iends While we reS P eet their iodependence. m a k- P d , !o P - y £ rdtefu }, lor th « hel P we have given them, but they fear lest we may couttrfL for themTh h6m f'- We a PP ro P riated too many Moslem afraid 'of n F'mP 1 T' re ? 1 * rust ln 0 ' ir disinterestedness, and they are terribly ' anDroval knd 7 R 0 b° U k 11 Ii ' the British with without the Sherifs o-rovesand d dSlt - RabeSh a- arl V ed f ° r0e Str011 S enough to take possession of the groaes and organise a position there, they would, I am convinced, say, ‘ We are ‘khpOtT ' an&lt; Sca ;, ter * 1 ° * he j r ‘“t. 8 - Sfcress has often been laid on the point that the en a s personally asked for British troops to be landed when the urgent moment comes. is woi ding snows Ims reluctance sufficiently; and when that urgent moment comes ween che resi stance of tribes collapses and theSberifs revolt has come to an end he will be the minority ol one. 5 cm i^ d0 / 10t ^ hl v k an T ° ne who has exam i n «d Hejaz lately will contest that the k.herifs strength lies only among the tribes, and it follows that when the tribes go over to the lurks there is no more “ Sherifs movement.” 6 The objections to the landing of a British force do not apply to aeroplanes. The Arabs look upon these as delightful [one group undecipherablejs and are longing for them ; they also want instructors in technical matters (artillery, machine-guns, bombing W. I., and armoured cars) and are prepared on these (?) grounds to welcome the French coiitmgent and anything we like to send. No European escort is necessary, if they behave tactfully and follow local advice, and if the Turks break through prematurely (a.s they may do if reinforced) the personnel and all the light equipment can be disembarked and the rest destroyed. The French Military Mission sees in a different light. They say: £i Above all things the Araos must not take Medina. This can be assured if an Allied force landed at Babegh. The tribal contingents will go home, and we will be the sole bulwark of the Sheur m Mecca. At the end of the war we give him Medina as his reward.” This is of course a definite policy, agreeable to their larger schemes- It breaks down, I think, in the assumption that an Allied force at Babegh would defend Mecca for good and all. Once the Turks are able to dispense with the tribal resistance, they will be able to advance along any of the central or eastern roads to Mecca, leaving the iranco-Britisii force a disconsolate monument on the dusty beach at Babegh. The policy of not landing a British force at Babegh should not be made an excuse for doing nothing in Hejazu If we spare ourselves this expense and trouble, it is all the more incumbent upon us to stiffen the tribal army, on which we are going to rely for the defence of Mecca. This stiffening is (by request) not to consist of personnel, but of materials. Sherif Faisal asked nearly four months ago for three batteries of Q.F. mountain guns, and not only have none been sent, but he has not been given any written or verbal answer to his demand. There may be no Q.F. mountain guns in the British army: there are plenty in Greece and Italy and France (and perhaps in Portugal) ; the British Government can certainly supply them if it wishes, and if it does not it must take the resoonsibility if the tribes’ resistance fails, and they will certainly not carry on for an indefinite time in the present circumstances. On the other hand, if they are given these guns (whose value will be mainly moral) they will, in my opinion, be able to hold up the present Turkish force as long as they require. Their moral is excellent, their tactics and manner of fighting admirably adapted to the very difficult country they are defending, and their leaders fully understand that to provoke a definite issue now is to lose the war. To continue the present guerre de courses is sooner or later to wear out the Turks completely, aud force them back on a passive defence of Medina and its railway communications. IBN SAUD. Sir Percy Cox telegraphed on the 13th November that he had met Ibn Sand at Ojair on the 11 th November and the following day. The upshot of their conversation v\as that it was not practicable to bring about effective co-operation with Hejaz, but with certain material assistance a demonstration against Ibn Bashid was feasible. Ibn Sand was coming on to Bahrein, with a view of proceeding thence on a rapid visjt tp the Shaykhs of Koweyt and Mohammerah by water ; it was being arranged that H.M.S. “Juno should take him to Koweyt. From Mohammerah, if army commander had no objection, Sir P. Cox proposed to arrange for a short visit to Basra. Ibn Sand recently arrested the Turkish emissary and handed over to our agent the 700 camels which the latter had bought. He, Sir P. Cox, recommended that the K.C.I.E. should [898—17] D10 be conferred on Ibn Sand, and that he should be allowed to announce this on his approaching visit to Koweyt, where he was to deliver the O.S.I. to the Shaykh. By a telegram to toe Viceroy, dated the 15th November, Mr. Chamberlain authorised the grant of the K.C.I.E., and suggested that, when conferring it, SirP. Cox, in addition to general expressions of confidence and satisfaction, might intimate^ the ^ particular pleasure of His Majesty’s Government; at the same time assuring Ibn baud that he need have no misgivings, because His Majesty’s Government had carefully^ reserved all his rights, and the Sherif had expressly stated that he had no intention of interfering with them.

Note to the Resident on the Political Situation by the First Assistant Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Jacob. I put up a few remarks re the political urgency of a move in this quarter. Idrisi. 1 . We cannot get the Idrisi to move energetically unless we do so. He told me last January at an interview that he knew we should win the war, but he was anxious to know the status of the Turks in the Yemen after the war. He said it was folly to oppose them, if they were after all to remain here, as he would be constantly subject to their vengeance. To break the Turks before Lahej will break their power in the Yemen. Imam. 2 . Imam will move fast enough if we lead the way and regain Lahej. His hands are tied now. He hates the Turks, but expects us to move and facilitate his work. Our Work as Arbitrators after the War. 3. After the war we have engaged to adjudicate between the Idrisi and Imam. Unless we pash the Turks out of Lahej we shall have no status as arbitrators. Difficulties with Imam after the War. 4. Again, if the Turks leave the Yemen by diplomatic means, we shall find the Imam taking his place and he will deride our pretensions to even our own Hinterland. To regain our prestige beyond our old border and vis-a-vis the Imam we must act forcefully. Trouble within our Borders. 5. Our reputation as a Government will be lost within our border if the Turks retire by diplomatic pressure. The Abdali, even when reinstated—unless by force—will have a very arduous task in rehabilitating himself amongst his tribesmen and neighbours, many of whom have joined hands with the Turks.Hadramaut. i'i Hadiamaut is seething with intrigue.

A. lost prestige will cripple us in our own sphere for years after fche war. ' 1 J Out Inaction assists every Intrigue in other Places. 7. A victory against the Turks at Lahej will greatly aid the Sherif of Mecca, and will also strengthen our cause in Somaliland and Abyssinia, where our failure to move has had the enect of encouraging Turco-Teutonic efforts. Our Allies await our Action. “ Mawia ” a Prospective Friend. 8 . As soon as we move, the friendly proteges, who are m a large majority, will aid us, and we shall secure the influential Arab Pasha, Tbn Nasir Mukhil, of Mawia, who loathes both Turk and Imam, but who was unable to carry out his engagement with us owing to our not going to meet him half-way. PART III. Syria and the “ Near Fast ” Newspaper. A telegram was sent to D.M.I. from Egypt on the 18th November calling attention to the fact that the “Near East,” in its issue of the k 20 th October, at p. 585, referred to efforts made by the local Patriarchs to relieve distress in Syria, and also to escape from Syria via Ruad Island, and adding that such hints to the Turks are most harmful and likely to prevent bulk of relief and future escapes. Propaganda. We learn from a trustworthy source that steps have been taken to distribute pamphlets, &amp;c., among the Turkish troops ; and that there is reason for thinking that good results have been achieved.12 APPENDIX. MISCELLANEOUS CUTTINGS FEOM THE PRESS. Mr. Asquith and Armenia. SPEAKING on the 9th November at the Mansion House banquet, Mr. Asquith sternly alluded to the systematic massacres of the Armenian race which have been carried out by the Turks during the war—massacres which Germany has never lifted a finger to prevent, and which have been on a scale without precedent. He foreshadowed “an era of liberty and redemption for this ancient people” at the end of the war. That can only mean the determination ot the Allies to rescue the Armenians permanently from the clutches of the Ottoman Turks, and we hope we are not drawing too large an inference from the passage in which the latter were alluded to as “ strangers and intruders in Europe ” if we interpret it as a threat to make an end, once and tor all, of their baleful presence. But, while we applaud, let us not forget that all this postulates, not merely victory, but crushing victory, over the Central Empires, and a long draft upon that “ stock of patience and resolve ” of which the Prime Minister spoke in his eloquent peroration.

The only cause of anxiety is as to whether the Turks will not break through before arrangements have jeen completed. Ihe ensuing period of transition will he very critical. Nure Sha’alan. The news in regard to Nuri Sha’alan is of importance. If the Anazeh tribe begin to rise in earnest they will extend the area of Turkish liability to molestation and attack. Almost the whole length of the ITejaz railway is open to Anazeh raids. If hv any means we can supply the Anazeh with arms, munitions, and money we should most certainly do so—via the Sherif is a long way round, but Arabs find their own way to rifles and money if they know where they are to be got. In order to elucidate the position of Nuri Sha’alan a map is appended showing the approximate spheres of influence of the Arab chiefs. Druses. The action of the Druses as reported by an agent (which is given with all reserve), if it prove correct, indicates that unrest is growing in Syria and Turkish power tending to weaken. It is important to remember that the Druses of the II an re n are a rallying point of deserters and disaffected officers ; the Druses are in touch with Nuri Sha’alan, and may act in co-operation with his northern bands. The Sherif’s Coronation. With regard to the Sherif’s assumption of regal dignity, it is suggested that the exact Arab word used by him to denote his title should be ascertained. He has probably not assumed the title of Sultan or Emir, which are only in the gift of the Caliphate, an office he evidently regards as in abeyance for the time being, 'it is also suggested that the Sherif should be induced to issue a proclamation making it quite clear that he does not pretend to exert any authority beyond his own borders. We could then recognise him and break the news to Ibn Sand and the rest as an ordinary official piece of intelligence. [898—16]i It ! The move of the Sherif in proclaiming himself king has manifest drawbacks ; but it also has the advantage of giving a possible rising in Syria a name and moral sanction which it has hitherto lacked. When the news that there actually is am Arab State with a recognised head percolates to Syria, it will act as a considerable stimulant on the disaffected parts of the population. Arab Troops Serving in Europe. According to intelligence from Mesopotamia Arab troops are serving in the Turkish armies in Europe. It is suggested that it would be well worth while scattering pamphlets by aeroplane describing the situation in Hejaz over the lines of the enemy where there are Turkish divisions. These pamphlets should only be in Arabic, as then the Turks will be unable to read them, and curiosity will prompt them to ask the Arabs to do so. The pamphlets could be printed in London and forwarded to Kussia. M. S.1 rinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence. SECRET. &gt; i For Reference only. 4734 , 3 1 i y i b ■ ARABIAN REPORT. N.S.

Rabegh and the Situation in General. On the 3rd November Sir H. McMahon transmitted [No. 964] a message from Sir R. Wingate TNo. 629J for the Foreign Office saying that he had asked the Admiral C.-in-C. to send one or two monitors to Rabegh, and the G.O.C. Egypt to hold [? a brigade], if immediately available, in readiness to proceed to that place. He also enquired in regard to the French contingents whether he had the authority of their Government to order them to proceed to Rabegh. On the same date Sir H. McMahon [No. 965] transmitted a telegram [No. 632] from Sir R. Wingate asking that a previous telegram [No. 627] might be transmitted, which was done. In this the Sirdar stated :— 1 . That he hoped the aeroplanes would reach Rabegh at the end of this week (ending on the 11 th November), and that as Sir A. Murray could not spare an escort of Moslem troops, he (the Sirdar) was sending two companies of Egyptian infantry with two British officers; 2 . That he could not send another man or another gun, but had urgently requested Sir A. Murray to send a battery of field guns and several howitzers, without personnel, to Rabegh ; 3. That one machine-gun company of the French contingent had reached Suez, the remainder being expected to reach that place about the 15th November; 4. That Colonel Bremond maintained his opinion that this contingent should not proceed to Rabegh unless it be decided to send there four field batteries, two mountain batteries, and an Anglo-French force of a minimum strength of six battalions; but he had urged his Government to present to the Sherif several batteries without personnel, and had represented to it the necessity of sending infantry supports if the French contingent he landed at Rabegh ; [898—16] «/t5 . That the French contingent contains a number of recruits, and probably will not be fit to go inland till about the 15th December, without, that is, its French personnel. Colonel Bremond suggests that then it could be best employed as a single group, under Lieutenant-Colonel Cadi, on the eastern road to stiffen the Arab force. He said, too. that an engineer company could prepare field defences at Babegh. On the same date Sir H. McMahon further telegraphed [No. 966] that Colonel Wilson had informed him that the Senior Naval Officer, who had just reached Jeddah, said that the situation at Babegh was no cause for immediate anxiety; there was but little foundation, in fact, for the report of the Turkish advance. Sir H. McMahon added that Colonel Parker had informed him that an exaggerated report of a recon- naisance of eighty camel corps men at Shatira was the origin of the news of a Turkish advance. On the 7 th November Sir B. Wingate sent a long telegram [No. 9j to the Foreign Office, in which he dealt with the whole situation. Since sending his telegram of the 2 nd November [No. 627], Admiral Wemyss and Captain Lawrence had arrived from a visit to Faisal’s camp, and he had discussed the situation with them. In regard to the military situation in Hejaz, at present the salient features were:— 1. If strongly attacked by the Turks, the Babegh position, even with naval assistance, would be impossible to hold unless— (a.) Begular troops (a brigade at least), with artillery, could arrive there in time, and this is ruled out by the decision of the War Office that troops are not available ; or ( 6 .) A trained Arab force of about 5,000 men, with artillery, were available for defence ; as to this, see under “ Arab Trained Band.” 2 . The necessity for keeping in the field the most important group of Arab tribesmen ; those, that is, who have hitherto operated under Faisal, who during the last five months (they being 3,000 in number) have operated on the hills on a line Kheif-Shofida Ghayir, with their base at Hamra and Bir Ibn Hassani, and have constituted the sole Arab defence against a Turkish advance south. With the full concurrence of the naval Commander-in-Chief, the Sirdar proposed to supply to the tribal army now at Kheif, &amp;c., the moral and material support (guns, machine guns, aeroplanes) necessary to enable them to continue their attempts on the Hejaz rail way and their defensive in the hills. If they are successful in this, time will be given for the development of action as proposed under the following headings :— (1.) Babegh. This will be the British aeroplane station, the training ground for the new Arab trained bands, and a naval base for (group undecypherable) Arab military forces. (2.) French Contingent. Its training can be completed at Babegh, to which place it will proceed direct. Acting on the spirit of instructions received from the Foreign Office, the Sirdar would now convey orders to this effect to Colonel Brbmond. (3.) Arab Trained Bands. For the garrisoning of Babegh, and the provision of a stable element with armed tribesmen in the field, the necessity for an organised and trained Arab force is obvious; and for such trained bands the Sherif has collected a promising lot of townsmen and villagers. The rapidity with which this force can be made efficient depends on the possibility of at once providing a nucleus of partially trained men. The Government of India has therefore been requested to send as soon as possible such a proportion of Arab military [? prisoners] now in India, as may be fit for active service. Arab officers from India confidently expect that a good percentage of these prisoners would join the Sherif; if this should be so, the problem of trained bands would be simplified. A strength of 5,000 is aimed at. Sir A. Murray will assist as far as his resources permit in the equipment, but such requirements as Egypt and Sudan cannot supply must be sent from England.(4.) British Military Mission. H i at there should be a small expert military staff at Eabegh is a matter of great urgency, as its functions would be the superintendence of the organisation of the trained bands and the appreciation of, and advising on, the military situation. Colonel Newcombe should be sent as soon as possible, with an engineer officer and an artillery officer, and, if possible, his assistants should have had previous experience of Arabs. The Sirdar asked for the confirmation by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of his pnposed course of action. The instructions from the Foreign Office referred to above were sent on the 6 th^ November, being to the following effect : The recent emergency at Eabegh was sufficient to show that, when essential issues were involved, the principle of not allowing Christians in Hejaz must be abandoned. The Sirdar therefore should inform the Sherif that he had been entrusted with the supervision of military assistance to the Arabs ; tha't the pivot of the present situation was clearly Eabegh, which, provided they had their Christian officers and technical personnel, could be secured by French and Sudanese troops and artillery ; and that therefore, if he wished to protect Eabegh and the road to Mecca, the Sherif must give the strictest orders for complete facilities for the British and French units at Eabegh, who would have to be entirely withdrawn if there were any difficulties. As regarded the French troops at Eabegh, a note had been received from the French Government which the Secretary of State interpreted as giving the Sirdar a free hand, and he was so informing the French Government. The War Committee^ Proposal. p/:. • In regard to this, Sir F. Wingate telegraphed [No. 5] on the 7th November that the scheme proposed by the War Committee was not practicable. Great difficulty was experienced in keeping the Sudanese units up to establishment, and the only means of increasing the supply rapidly would be to adopt conscription ; and this would not be advisable, as the steps necessary for enforcing it inevitably arouse bitter recollections in the mind of the older natives, and fear and resentment in that of the younger. The effect would be to excite fanaticism, and also hostility to the British Government. Nuri Shaalan. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 977] on the 6 th November that Colonel Wilson bad informed him that the Sherif had heard from Faisal that the Arab chief, Nun Sha’alan, had revolted against the Turks, and had had a fight with their troops, which he had defeated. The Coronation. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 978] on the 6 th November, that Colonel Wilson had telegraphed that he had been privately informed by Abdulla that the Sherif was crowned on the morning of the 4th November, and that 60,000 people acknowledged him King. On the day of the coronation the Sirdar telegraphed [No. 2 ] that Colonel Wilson had reported conversations which had taken place between himself and Abdulla m regard to the assumption of the regal dignity. Abdulla said the royal style had been assumed in compliance with the request of the Hejaz shaykhs, and that his action was not only for the good of his people and of Moslems in general, but also would refute enemy reports regarding his dependence on Great Britain. The declaration had been deferred as the Sherif had been anxious to obtain the complete confidence of His Majesty's Government, and if his ally was dissatisfied with him, he was prepared to resign the style he had adopted. He had no intention to interfere wuth Ibn k.aud or other Arab chiefs or to extend the boundaries of his kingdom ; and he left the question of the caliphate to the decision of the Moslem world. tt i\/r ivr The Foreign Office telegraphed [No. 880] on the 3 rd November to Sir H. McMa on saying that Colonel Wilson should be told to inform the Sherif that His Majesty s Government had been informed of the coming coronation and that he had been instructed to offer sincere congratulations, adding that His Majesty s Government was in consultation with its allies on the question of a joint official recognition of the ne position, but there might be some delay, as the enemy was not yet comp e e y e ea e , and a premature recognition might greatly injure the Sherif s cause. The French Government instructed Colonel Bremond to reply m the same terms as Colonel Wilson.IDTIISI of ASIR. The Viceroy telegraphed [P. 4499] to the India Office on the Slst October saying that Idrisi wanted and was willing to pay for the installation of telephone communi cation between Sabia and Jizan, places some 20 miles apart. The Indian Government supported the proposal in view of the importance of the naval and Aden authorities being able to keep in close touch with Idrisi; but it thought that the best arrangement would be for the Egyptian telegraph service, if possible, to erect and maintain it, as the Indian Telegraph Department would find a difficulty in arranging maintenance. On the 4th November the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon jfNo. 883] asking him to make the necessary arrangements if he should see no objection. IBN SAUD. On the 27th October the Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Viceroy in regard to Ibn Sand. Mr. Chamberlain said that if Ibn Sand’s letter of the 20 th July indicated a disposition to play off Egyptian authorities against India, Sir. Percy Cox should discourage any such attempt, at the same time allaying any suspicion either that the Sherif was not acting in good faith or that the British Government would sacrifice his, Ibn Saud’s, interests. Ibn Sand’s military value is small in regard to the Turks, but he can help indirectly by keeping Ibn Pashid in check and preventing him from attacking Basra or the Sherif; and this need not involve the capture of Hail. Sir Percy Cox might report Ibn Saud’s actual requirements, if some assistance in the way of munitions is really needed. MASKAT. Among papers received from Basra is a memorandum, written in September, in which it is stated that the Sultan had issued a few passports to Maskat subjects wishing to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.

The G.O.C., Force D, telegraphed on the 4th and 5th November saying that there was strong evidence of the arrival of considerable reinforcements at Bagdad since the middle of October; that a deserter Algerian officer had reported that his battalion of French-Africans and Indians, 400 strong, was at Kermanshah early in September; that the Kurds frequently raided the Turkish lines of communication ; and that the first 45 miles of telegraph lines under construction from Bunder Abbas to Kerman should be complete by the 6 th November.

THIS report contains a large amount of miscellaneous information which is difficult to appreciate in a general way. It is therefore taken under various headings CD * The Rabegh Cinsrs. The sduation at Rabegh is the most important factor in Ilejaz affairs : apparently the Turks are making the expected advance, and we are suffering to the full from ad the inconveniences arising from our complicated and practically unworkable system of management as described in Report XIY (N.S). We do not know— 1 . Where Colonel Bremond’s contingent is. O This is owing t &gt; lack of liaison between French and British. 2. YThether aeroplanes have gone to Rabegh or not. This is owing to divided control. 3. What available troops the Sirdar may have. This is owing to the Sudan being independent of the War Office. 4. Whether the Sherif’s message in regard to his son’s victory or Aziz’s message in regard to the danger to Rabegh is the correct one. This is owing to lack of organised intelligence. o o o The only thing that can be said is that, by repeating simultaneously everybody’s telegrams to everybody else, the best effort has been made under the circumstances to meet the emergency which has arisen. If we get through this crisis, it will certainly be necessary to reorganise the political and military control. The Rabegh crisis has shown the grave dangers to which our present system exposes us. Had we taken the matter in hand in a businesslike way in June it is safe to say that by now we should have financed, raised, equipped, and drilled an adequate regular force for the Sherif, and that we should be able to get an accurate account of the situation from day to day, and have the whole Arab movement throughout the peninsula tending to coherence. As it is, we have been drifting along until we have come up against a very dangerous crisis, which finds us in great disorder. As matters now stand, the Foreign Office is the only channel for the issue of military orders m Hejaz, which has become a field of operations. Ihis is contrary to all sense and experience. It is urged with all seriousness and earnestness that the moment has come to set matters right once for all in regard to Arabian policy and management. [898—15]2 The Shepjf declared King of the Arab Nation. Ths reasons for the Sherifs action are difficult to gauge. The following are suggested as possible contributing causes :— 1 . That Abdullah, his son, desires to assure his own future. 2 . That the Sherif may imagine that, in the event of defeat, it is better to he in the position at present held by the Kings of Belgium, Montenegro, and Servia than in that of a refugee pensioner. 3. That the Arabs are doubtful of our good faith, and wash to commit us definitely. 4. That the Syrian officers have set up an intrigue against France on the false hypothesis that the French intend to annex Damascus as French territory. It is suggested that the best course is for our representative to congratulate the Sherif privately, and to inform him that we shall consult our Allies as to future official recognition. Colonel Wilson should be asked to give us the exact title (in Arabic) assumed by the Sherif. The Italians and Idrisi. With regard to the reported despatch of rifles and ammunition to Idrisi by the Italians, it must be remembered that the Italian officials at Massowah are exceedingly imbued with expansive ideas, remote from control, and mostly Giolittists. Islam Kultur. Special attention is drawn to the proceedings of the Islam Kultur Society in Berlin. If the Turks are successful in their operations against the Sherif and retake Mecca, we may expect to see a great development of the idea of assassination for political-religious ends. There will be a private as well as a public Jehad, and (as a personal opinion) it is anticipated that the world will be surprised at the success which the Fidais will achieve. Mecca will be necessary to the organisers of this scheme as a furnace to generate enthusiasm. The idea of assassination is based upon the scheme of the ancient assassin sect who destroyed kings, sultans, Christian princes, and even ordinary persons of note during a period of about 150 years. Aden and the Press. Mr. W. T. Massey, who writes on the Bed Sea and Egyptian operations, gave some accounts of the Turkish reconnaissance at Bomani out of all proportion to the importance of the affair. His description of the Aden operations is much to be deprecated. It gives the Turks first-hand information regarding the extraordinary success of their army and of our inability to deal with this little Turkish detachment. An isolated force blockaded Aden and has occupied 9,000 square miles of British territory ever since it hunted the British expedition into Shaykh Othman, over a year ago. I he facts are unpleasant enough in themselves ; and such articles only give oppor- tunities to Turkish journalists, one of whom said “ the English army was made by God to give Turks victories.”3 To publiso our shame m this way shows a lack of appreciation of the meaning; of the word prestige. It very lascar who passes Aden knows that we cannot deal with the mi : s, ? ut we might leave the Turkish General Staff in ignorance of the details of our humiliation. )l r ilate Co-operation with the French. Piiwite nevys comes to hand that there is great suspicion and misunderstandino- between the British and French in Hejaz. This is deplorable in every way, and is based on both parties being unaware of the actual relations of the Governments of the two countries and the complete harmony which exists on Middle East questions, t is suggested that a tactful instruction to British officers engaged in Flejaz work, uiging them to fiankness and the cultivation of mutual good feeling’, would do much to allay a temper which will tend, if left unchecked, to do harm to British, French, and Arab alike.

Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 941] on the 27th October that Colonel Parker had reported that on the 23 rd Faisal had retreated towards Hamra : and that on the 26th Colonel Wilson had telegraphed [No. 412] that he had received a private letter from Abdulla and a telegram from the Sherif. The latter stated that Faisals retreat was expected ; but Abdulla says that the Sherif was very much worried about it and was awaiting with impatience immediate British military help to garrison Rabegh and stop the expected Turkish advance. Under instructions from the Sirdar, Colonel Wilson was replying that, for reasons explained to Abdulla at their meeting, it was impossible to send British troops, but that their needs had been fully represented to His Majesty’s Government, whose decision would be communicated as soon as possible, McMahon tele g ra ph e( } 0 n the 30th October [No. 943 ] that Colonel Parker had reported that the situation did not improve, and that the Rabegh force was entirely unready either to defend that place or to advance.

Intormution Iid lieen i eceived thut 1 regard to the situation on [898—15]tij, J Medioa the Turks had, on the 21 st, spent, or proposed to spend, about 50,000h on camels and 2,0001. on goods from Abyssinia—which may mean cash sent to Abyssinia. The Turks occupied Bir Abbas on the 22 nd as an aeroplane base ; a company of the 23rd battalion was sent to Buait from Medina, and two companies detrained at Abu el Nain, for straightening rails ; 500 rifles with ammunition were sent from Medina XT' Tebuk. On the same day the 30th October, the Arab Bureau telegraphed to the Sirdar that the Turks, south and south-west of Medina had been reinforced, and that each of their three regiments consisted of four battalions each with from 800 to 1,000 men. They were well supplied with camels. Between Medina and Bir Abbas, they were engaged upon improving roads, communications, and water-supply. Faisal witli 4,000 men had retired from Jedieda to El Hamra, 15 miles, S.W., of Bir Abbas. The situation at B-abegh was not considered satisfactory. At present Ali has only about 2,000 good men there. On the 31st October Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 951] that the Arab Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Mecca had informed him that Faisal had compelled the Turkish forces to withdraw from “the two northern localities in the neighbourhood of Medina,” and that the pursuit would be followed up. But on the 1 st November the Arab Bureau telegraphed [A.B. 126] to the D.M.I. that Ali and Aziz, then on board the “ DufFerin,” stated that an advance had been made by the Turks to Ebn Al Hassani [group undecypherable] 30 kilom. south of El Hamra and only three days march from B,abegh. Both of them thought that the Turks were advancing seriously, not only by the Sultani but also by the inland road, and Aziz added the men of Shaykh Hussein of Babegh were with the Turks. They said that, if seriously attacked, they could not hold Babegh and urgently [group omitted] assistance as soon as possible, guns, and machine guns, especially, complete with British crews. On the same date, 1st November, the French Embassy communicated a note to the Foreign Office in regard to the sending of a force to Babegh. The note began by pointing out that His Majesty’s Government had systematically replied to all suggestions that such a force should be sent by urging the inadvisability of sending Christian officers to Hejaz. The situation had, however, changed. On the one hand, the Turks ^had taken Germans to Medina, as everyone in Arabia knew; and on the other, the Sherif and Abdulla threaten to open negotiations with the Turks if this help be not given Again, Colonel Bremond says that it would be highly imprudent to land the guns and mitrailleuses sent from Algiers unless they could be protected bv a sufhcient escort to secure their not falling into enemy hands. In these circumstances tne Charge d Affaires has been instructed by his Government to request in the most pressing manner His Majesty’s Government to examine afresh the question of sending a sufficient force to Babegh to constitute a base, to suggest to the Sherif that he has not been abandoned, and to calm the spirit of doubt which has arisen among the t? 11 ^ ovren ]^ er a ^ ar Committee was held at which it was decided that e Foreign Office should telegraph to Sir H. McMahon instructing him to request the Sir ar t? communicate with the Admiral Commanding in Chief, who had been instructed to give what naval protection he could at Babegh. It was understood from a previous report that he considered that the Arabs could hold the place with naval assistance ; if this should not be the case, Sir H. McMahon should send to Babegh Sudanese mi ^ assistance mi g ht be immediately available, French, British, or French Troops for the Sherif. On the 26th October Lord Granville telegraphed from Paris [No. 1107] that mountain batteries, with complete personnel, were being sent to Suez, where, if His Majesty s Government so desired, the Christian officers would be left, and the batteries, with their Moslem personnel, sent to Babegh or anywhere else. But the French overnmen emphasised the fact that this Moslem personnel was comparatively useless without its officers being new and slightly trained. ^ ^ Request for Pecuniary Assistance. u J ? r H ; 5 cMahon telegraphed [No. 942] on the 28th October that Captain Storrs i o d ooo 7 0U ? ht i *5' request from Abdulla, the Sherifs son, for a further grant of 10,0001., to help him m dealing with tribes to the north of Hejaz.

Visit of a French Warship to Jeddah. • ^ re . nc ^ Admiralty telegraphed to the Admiralty on the 23rd October saymg that, in response to a request made to the Arabian political mission by the bhern s son Abdulla for permission to visit a French warship, the French cruiser -rothuau had been sent from Djibouti! to Jeddah ; she would only remain a few days at the latter place, and would return to Djiboutil as soon as her mission was accomplished. IBN SAUD. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 31st October that he had received a telegram from Sir Percy Cox, dated the 29th October, transmitting a telegram which he, Sir Percy Cox, had received from the Political Agent at Bahrein to the following effect. The Political Agent said that he had received an open letter, addressed to Sir Percy Cox, from Ibn Sand, who requested that he should'read it and telegraph its contents. This gist of this letter was: ( 1 ) The Turkish Government had sent twenty-five officers (German and Turkish) with 300 men, with guns and supplies, to Ibn Bashid, and with them Bashid Ibn Lyla, the Constantinople agent of Ibn Bashid. One Turkish and two German officers had left Hail with Bashid in the direction of Iraq ; ( 2 ) The troops detailed for moving on Mecca had returned to Syria, the Turks in Medina having abandoned this expedition ; (3) Ibn Sand was very anxious to have an interview with Sir P. Cox. The latter added that he was just leaving for Bahrein, and suggested that if the Army Commander had no objection it would be well for him to see Ibn Sand, who, if he did not do so, would misinterpret his having been so near at hand and not having complied with his request. The Viceroy thought that this meeting should clear the air. MASKAT. [Nil.] KOWEYT AND THE TBUCIAL COAST. [Nil.] BAHBEIN. [Nik]4 PART 11. POLITICAL NOTES FKOM THE FIELDS OF OPEEATIONS. r Aden, The Pesident at Aden telegraphed [2G9 A.P.] on the 23rd October that H.M.S. “ Minto ” had reported from Jizan the arrival there of an Italian ship of war on the 19th October, and that it was reported locally that she had landed 100 cases of rifle ammunition. She left on the following day for Massowah. The Italians, during their late war with Turkey, had an agreement with Idrisi, but for a long time all relations had ceased. Subsequent, however, to the commencement of the present war, it v^as said that a mission had gone to Pome from Idrisi, but this was afterwards contradicted. The Pesident has recently sent quantities of Wetterli ammunition to Idrisi, wherefore, if what is now reported be true, he cannot understand it. The Pesident telegraphed again [272 A.P.] on the 27th October, saying that it was then reported from an authentic source that an interpreter of the Italian Government had taken to Jazin from Massowah 100 cases of rifles as a present for Idrisi. On the 26th October the Foreign Office instructed Sir P. Podd, Ambassador in Pome, to enquire into the matter. From a private telegram sent to him at the same time it appears that the Italian Government was asked by us some time ago to send ammunition to Idrisi. Sir P. Podd replied [No. 1064] on the 28th October, saying that he had been informed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the Governor of Erythrea had sent the ammunition without consulting him. The Governor had possibly acted thus in consideration of the fact that we had suggested that a certain amount of ammunition should be supplied to Idrisi; but he had given orders that no such measures should be taken without consulting him, and it would not occur again. Sir P. Podd further said that the Minister did not appear to be at all pleased with the Governor’s action. A nephew of the latter was secretary-general at the Foreign Office, and Sir P. Podd, thinking that he is not sympathetic with his chiefs moderate action, would not be surprised if he had suggested to his uncle resumption of contact with Idrisi. The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 28th October [7533 G.I.] that reports indicated the departure on leave from Said Pasha’s force of about 100 Arab irregulars ; and on the 30th [7548 G.I.] that reports also indicated that about the 20 th ^October letters from Somaliland and Abyssinia had reached Said Pasha, the purport of those from the former place being an offer of men by the Mullah. Said is reported to have replied to this, and to be endeavouring to get an answer across to Abyssinia. An ea.rher telegram [7492 G.I.], sent on the 25th October, said that lurkish artillery had fired at our patrol, but there had been no casualties. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. An Agent's Report on the Situation and Feeling in Syria. Arab Feeling. (Note. With reserve.) Djemal Pasha is making great efforts to curry favour with the Ulema Ashraf and all Arab notables by distributing decorations to some and granting favours to others but with no success. An Arab soldier, who recently arrived from Medina, informed the people that the Stmiif was e\eiywhere victorious, and that the fall of Medina was expected shortly which would be a proof of his success. These statements were received with approbation by the audience. r The Bedouins at Bir Saba and district are reported to be anxiously awaitino- the arrival of the Sherd’s troops before rising against the Turks. The Druses of the Hauran are the most eager for revolt, recognising the opportunity for complete Arab independence owing to the position of Turkey.

Germans. Many German officers have arrived at Beirut from Bir Saba and El Arish, and among them two senior officers who have been wounded. The German officer who commanded the last attack on the Canal is at Hotel Gassmann, in Beirut. Reported Turkish Opinion on Last Attack on Canal. A captain, Christian Doctor, on leave at Beirut from Sinai, told Agent that he estimated the Turkish losses at 30,000 dead, wounded, and prisoners. The soldiers expected the British to follow them even as far as Domascus. The troops were most depressed at their failure, and it was expected that they would leave El Arish. Guns and troops have already been withdrawn in order to send them to Arabia. Those troops who were not sent to Arabia were expected to go to Constantinople, as much anxiety was felt for the safety of the city. After the withdrawal of their troops, many of whom had already left for Arabia, only two Christian Labour Battaiions would be left at El Arish. Recruits. “ Five days ago '’ (? 16th September) orders were received from Constantinople that persons between the ages of 18 and 40 years who had paid their “bedel” would not be permitted to do so again, but would be compulsorily enrolled for service. Miscellaneous. Two motors have been mounted in two boats, which will be sent to the Dead Sea to act as tugs. The Germa?i Society Islam Kultur. There was a notice in the last Arabian Report [p. 8 ] of a meeting of this society in Berlin at which it was resolved to murder Mohammedan rulers and notables on the side of the Allies. An agent has furnished further information on this subject. He says:— “ The promulgation - of the ‘ Fetva ’ decided upon at the above meeting in Berlin is to be expected as soon as may be. The scope of the same is to excite armed revolt against enemy Powers, and to confirm the mandate given in words to the agents (Eidai) by the Pan-Tslam propagandists. The ‘ Eetva ’ will be drawn up by the Sheik U1 Islam with the help of the several Ulema representing the various religious Mohammedan communities who are attached to the caliphate. These will assemble at the next anniversary of the ‘ Pavlud ’ in the royal palace of Top Capu, where the bones (relics) of the Prophet are preserved, with a view to an under standing in this respect. [898—15] C/ 6 “ In these ‘ Fetva ’ there will be specified the lawful reason whereby every Moslem shall consider himself authorised to help the ‘ Fidai ’ both morally and materially, since the ‘ Fidai ’ are charged to punish by death those amongst the princes and chiefs of the Moslem world who, continuing their present policy, are ruinina: the power of Islam and the influence of the caliphate of Constantinople. “ The significance of the mandate conferred on the emissaries and Young Turk homicides is that it is strictly limited to princes and chiefs of the Mohammedans, guilty of treachery and hence liable to the death penalty according to the ‘ Sciaria,’ whereas the political and military heads of the Quadruple Alliance being free to act in their own interests in support of their own cause, their murder, according to Moslem law, would be unjustifiable under the circumstances. “ In preparation for the general Moslem rising, the central empires are sending a large quantity of arms and munitions to North Africa by means of German submarines and neutral sailing ships which appear to have bases on the Spanish coast. “ Among those Arab nationalists who are interested, there is specially indicated Mohamed Scetuan, brother of the late deputy for Bengasi-Jussf, Scetuab Bey, who is now in Berlin, to assist Pan-Islamic propaganda receiving a monthly stipend from the German Government. “ It has not been possible to date to obtain information of the arrival in Switzerland of the Young Turk homicides. The number of students from the East has been increasing for some time at Lausanne-Ouchy and the neighbourhood. Amongst others there are young Egyptians, Libians, and youths from French North Africa, who travel freely between Germany and Switzerland, and are consequently suspect. Some of them come from Turkey as finance students. These must evidently have left their country of origin, before or after the war, with Entente passports which they will use when returning.” Saiyid Talib Bey. Saiyid Talib, who is at present residing in India, offered his services to the British Government; explaining that previously he had been prevented by promises made to the Turks not to actively help the English, but now he was free to do so, as the Turks had included his name in a list of those appointed for execution. The matter was referred to Cairo, but tbe High Commissioner regretted that at present there was nothing open for Saiyid Talib either in Cairo or Mecca. [I.O. : P. 4270.] r r V The Indian Officers who Visited the Sherif. The D.M.I. telegraphed to the Arab Bureau on the 31st October that these two officers had been granted three months’ leave of absence to India. APPENDIX. Cuttings from the Press. Buns in Palestine .

The defence of Aden is well organised, as a strategic point m the Imperial chain should be, and is in safe hands. • e . U , r 1 k lias ^ad many troubles with the Arabs in the Yemen, and some are still inconveniently unfriendly. Doubtless his position in Southern Arabia would have been ope ess i e a not made a show ot activity, and it may well be his eyes were directed more to the tribesmen than upon winning the key to the Bed Sea. ■ i- ^ T as ^ year Ali Said Pasha, with the 39th Turkish Division, descended 1T t t u G - r&gt;^ n '• 1 EL | :ei ^ an h’ and has remained there ever since. His headquarters are at Bahesj, miles by road from the port and 13 miles from our front line. If you cross e is mus which connects the rocky promontory of Aden with the mainland, you presently come to the populous village of Sheykh Othman, a pleasant spot in an arid country, with a water supply of its own. . Sheykh Othman is well entrenched, has been made strong by careful forethought and an infinite expenditure of labour, and is connected with Aden by a railway, over which runs rolling-stock bearing the letters of a we - nown Indian line. Sheykh Othman is the lock of the gate to Aden, and the qu i f ^ llke ? J t0 get P ossession of the . key. About 4 miles to the north-east of ey h Othman is the village of Imad, which we also hold, and which denies to the urk access to the trade route by the coast east of Aden. There was a serious attack on Imad six months ago, but it was well beaten off, with 200 enemy casualties. In this affair a number of Germans from Java who had landed on the Arabian coast a long way from Aden took an active part. British and Indian troops are doing hard work, but the climate, which takes a heavier toll on physical energy than even the blistering sun’s rays m the Egyptian desert, is the white man s greatest burden. Some of the officers here have seen service in France, Egypt, and Gallipoli, and there is not one officer in the garrison who would not be chafing to take a share at the Western front if he did not appreciate how important it is to guard this rocky station on the Imperial line.

One example, however, may be cited, since it shows at goe 6 tW 6 f undaaiental viciousness of the existing system. The standard telegram is No. 905 Egypt-Military. In it Sir Henry McMahon tells Lord Grey that the Girdar_ha s_told him (Sir Henry Mc~Mahon) that he (the S irdarrproposes to tell Colonel Wilson to tell the Sherif c^tMTthh^s, but thTThe (SirH^TTlvicMahcn) has made certain alterations m the text of the message which the Sirdar desires Colonel W ilson to convey to the Shenf, and that the Sirdar concurs m the amendments. It is very lucky for us that for the moment nothing is happening in Arabia that requires either thought, decision, or action ; since, if there can be thirty telegrams a week about nothing, it would require a nice calculation to figure out how many telegrams would be necessary if something urgent were afoot. Hitherto we have had an easy time in Arab affairs, but unless we mend our ways we shall presently be confronted with some emergency, favourable or unfavourable, which will find us so helplessly entangled in the folds of our own garments as to be unable to either take advantage of good fortune or avert impending evil. The contingencies of successful Turkish action, or a spread of Arab disaffection, can be plainly foreseen ; but they cannot be provided against until an end is made of the present confusion. TV ith regard to the rest of the report, the following matters are worth watching :— (i.) There is a certain tendency to friction and suspicion between the British and French in Hejaz, with the natural corollary of the Sherif being tempted to set the two parties by the ears. This can be guarded against [898 — 14]2 by urging the British officers to close and frank co-operation with the French mission, and warning them against giving the Sherif any opportunity to discuss dangerous matters with any of our representatives, (ii.) The Rabegh Brigade is again to the fore; now that the scheme has been turned down definitely on our side. Colonel Brernond raises the proposal. Although it is almost trenching on the field of operations, it is ventured in this appreciation to suggest that if Colonel Bremond cannot see his wav to allow of the landing of the French guns at ftabegh without an escort of infantry and a large complement of European officers, these guns and men might be of use to the SheriFs cause at some other point on the Bed Sea coast north of Weg or south of Jeddah, where there can be no religious objection to their presence. (iii.) The success of the two Indian officers’ visit to the Sherif announced by Captain Bray is satisfactory, and should tend to allay the fears expressed when his mission was first proposed. (iv.) Special attention is drawn to the report of an agent on the German society Islam Kultur. The resolution regarding the despatch of assassins, for the purpose of murdering Moslem rulers favourable to the Allies, is a very probable development. This side of Young Turkism will require careful watching now and hencefbrw’ard. (v.) The King case has its bearing on Arab affairs. Mr. Ptaffolovitch was in contact with Pickthall, Field, and Posher, and probablv in touch with Zeynab Charlton and Margaret B,obimon, all persons in close sympathv with the inner aims and objects of the C. IT.P. and not ordinary Turco- phiis of the sentimental type. Pickthall was mentioned in King’s letter to Baffolovitch as being a recipient of Baffolovitch's letters to Kincr. (vi.) Agha Khan’s letter on Middle Eastern affairs suffers from the usual Indian fault of its writer not knowing exactly what he wants to sav. According to Agha Khan, whether we beat the Turks or sue for peace, Vith Kut and Gallipoli to our discredit, is one and the same thing. Although he repeats this idea three times in the letter, it is obvious that it is not the one he wishes to convey, but what he really intends it is impossible to make out. (vii.) Special attention is drawn to Ghalib Pasha’s message to Abdulla Bey [the son of the Sherif] previous to capitulation [see p. 20], it is a good example of the tone in which a Turk addresses an Arab w r hen the latter is victorious. This document might be useful in India at a later date. M. S. (SECRET. For Reference only. ARABIAN REPORT. N.S. No. XV. October 25, 1916 (night). A A Contents. PART 1. The Sherif of Mecca.

McMahon transmitted [No. 914] a telegram received by him from the Sirdar asking that all communications, political and military, passing between England, Egypt, and India, and bearing on his responsibilities, might be communicated to him ; and asking whether it would save misunderstanding if he telegraphed direct to London and repeated to Cair o ; he also enquired as to his position in regard to the naval commander-in-chief. On the 20 th October Sir H. McMahon informed the Foreign Office [No. 919] that he had informed the Sirdar that all communications bearing on the Arab movement had been and would be communicated to him ; that he understood that on military matters the Sirdar would communicate direct with the War Office, but that communications on other matters should be sent through him unless the Foreign Office should otherwise direct; that when necessary he had better address the naval commander-in-chief directly, repeating to Cairo, but in most cases it would suffice to communicate with the senior naval officer in the Red Sea, to whom wide authority had been delegated. Sir H. McMahon added that it was important for him to know what passed between the Sirdar and the naval authorities. As to the delegation of authority, Sir H. McMahon had remarked in a telegram [No. 905] to the Foreign Office on the 16th October that the need of such important alterations as he had made in the Sirdar’s proposed communication to the Sherif illustrated the difficulty he felt in formulating such [group undecypherable] to him, even in Hejaz matters, as would preclude the possibility of inconvenient overlapping with wider issues. But on the 20 th October he telegraphed [No. 918] that he had informed the Sirdar that, in regard to the delegation of political authority, in the control of local political matters which concerned Hejaz only, and did not relate to outside affairs or affect the general policy of the Arab movement, the best arrangement would be for him [898—14] Bwas proceeding to do so that afternoon ; the Turks were rapidly forming a market there at the expense of Comfida, and were terrorising the local tribes, who would be forced to join them. On the 23rd October Sir H. McMahon [No. 930] transmitted a telegram sent on •e previous day to the Sirdar by Colonel Wilson, who said that Abdulla had informed him : — 1. That a party ol Harb had, east of Medina, defeated a force from Ibn Hashid, killing 15 men and capturing 25 rifles, 10 horses, and 30 camels ; 2. That a lurkish force had been destroyed near Medina by another party of Arabs. The Salieh tribesmen captured 150 from the Turks. The Defence of Rabegh. On the 13th October the Secretary of State telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon [No. 821], for the information of the Sirdar, that, after careful consideration, the War Committee had already decided that a brigade could neither be spared for RaOegh nor sent to the Sudan to replace one sent from there ; that the doing so was made more than ever impossible by demands to assist Roumania ; and that the Indian Government considered the political objections to sending British troops to Hejaz to be most serious. He suggested that a visit to Rabegh of someone so important as the Sirdar might create some difficulty of the same kind: a point on which he was consulting the India Office. On the 15th October Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 901] the Sirdar’s reply. Sir R. Wingate was of opinion that they should await a further expression of the War Committee’s views, as they might be modified by the telegrams he had sent to Sir H. McMahon, which he presumed had been transmitted. He definitely cancelled his visit to Jeddah ; and if the War Committee should confirm its instructions, he would cancel the orders for despatch of aeroplanes and the holding a brigade in readiness for Rabegh. In this event he considered that the Sherif should be informed that British troops could not be sent to him, and that His Majesty’s Government would raise no objection to the landing of French troops in Hejaz. On the 16th October Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 905] that the Sirdar had communicated to the Arab Bureau his intention to send a message to Colonel Wilson for the information of the Sherif, subject to any observations which the High Commis sioner might wish to make. Sir H. McMahon struck out rather more than half the proposed telegram, which then read as follows :— “ His Majesty’s Government, after full consideration of political and military situation, have decided not to send a British expeditionary force to Rabegh. In arriving at their decision, His Majesty’s Government have been particularly influenced by necessity to refrain from any action which would be liable by [group undecypherable] to damage prestige of Arab movement in the eyes of Moslems outside Hejaz. Reasons which preclude despatch of British to Hejaz coast do not appear to militate with equal force against acceptance by Sherif of Moslem Arab contingent which has been placed at his disposal by French Government; and you should therefore advise that, provided Sherif considers French assistance may be useful and necessary to him, he should accept it in the same spirit as he accepted services of Egyptian artillery and escorts. You should further impress on Sherif Abdulla that with assistance in personnel and war materiel they are receiving, Arab armies, although inferior with regard to artillery, should be sufficiently numerous and formidable to prevent a successful advance by Turks from Me u in a, and that, provided proper arrangements are made by Arabs to interfere with Turkish commurncati'ons, reinforcement of Turkish force at Medina will prove increasingly difficult, and ultimately it is hoped impossible, owing to British operations now in progress north of Hejaz.” Viscount Grey telegraphed his approval of the amended message on the 17th October [No. 831]. On the 18th October Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 911] that the Sirdar had informed him that, as he had received no modification of the instructions sent by the Foreign Office on the 13th October [No. 821 ], he had formally issued the instructions to Colonel Wilson noted above as modified by the High Commissioner, and further instructions [no copy received] regarding the return to Suez of the flight of aeroplanes.4 Sir H McMahon added that these aeroplances were on their way to Rabegh under instructions to the Commander-in-chief from the Sirdar. In a later telegram, transmitted by Sir H. McMahon on the 21 st October [No. 924], the Sirdar explained that he had decided not to send the aeroplanes, because their employment at Rabegh would necessitate the presence of a large British force. On the 18th October the Foreign Office forwarded through Sir H. McMahon [No. 834] a communication for the Sirdar from the C.I.G.S. to the following effect. The War Committee had decided not to send British troops to Rabegh, and British troops could not be sent to relieve Sudanese troops for the Sherif, who must rely on his own resources except as regards munitions and supplies (which would be sent as far as other calls permitted), and such assistance as the Sirdar himself could give in the shape of Mohammedan personnel raised and trained either in Hejaz or Sudan by such Moham medan instructors as could be found. It was hoped before long to keep the Turks busy on the Egyptian frontier, and there did not seem to be any immediate danger of the Sherif collapsing now that the pilgrimage had been successfully completed. The Government’s military policy was that France and Flanders were the chief theatres of war, and consequently our efforts were concentrated on being strong there and on reducing commitments elsewhere as far as possible. This policy should guide the Sirdar, as all other commanders in secondary theatres. On the following day the Foreign Office telegraphed to the Sirdar through Sir H. McMahon [No. 836], telling him that His Majesty’s Government had decided that neither a British nor a Sudanese brigade could be sent to Rabegh, as, apart from military reasons, there were political objections to the sending of either British troops or British officers; but that he had full discretion to arrange with the Commander-in- chief, Egypt, to send guns, aeroplanes, and supplies which were really required and could be spared, and, further, to arrange with Colonel Bremond for the despatch, when ready, of the guns and instructors sent by the French Government. In regard to the landing of British troops in Hejaz, an absolutely reliable agent reports that, in talking with the Sherif’s son Ali, he explained to him our grave reluctance to send them even to the coast; and he seemed to agree that, from the Arab point of view, it would be a heavy blunder, save under rmperrous necessity. Ali said that three batteries of quick-firing guns would suffice them—one for defence and two for a possible advance against Medina. On the 19th October the Arab Bureau telegraphed to H.M.I. [A.B. 34 ] that Captain Lawrence (at Jeddah) had reported that nobody knew the real situation at Raoegh, to which place he and Aziz were going on the following day. Abdulla apparently wanted a foreign force there in case the Arab attack on Medina should end badly. Azrz, however, hoped to prevent any decisive risk, and thought that a British brigade was not necessary and would not be prudent ; the only way, in his opinion, to bring continuity and sense into the operations was to have a British staff' at Rabegh dealing directly with Faisal and All, without reference of details to the Sherif, of whom t e} \\ eie all afraid. The withdrawal of British aeroplanes was unfortunatelv simul taneous with the appearance of Turkish machines, but Aziz himself attached but little weight io them. Aziz speaks well of the Sherif’s troops and is cheerful On the 21st October the Sirdar telegraphed to C.I.G.S., saying that he had recalled the flight of aeroplanes directly, in consequence of the decision not to send n 18 . ces ^ fffibegh. lor future guidance, he asked to be informed as to whether the necessity of the presence of a strong British force at Rabegh was known to the War Committee at their meeting on the 17th October, at which the despatch of aeroplanes was finally considered and sanctioned. He asked to be informed, to prevent any conflict of opinion in the future, whether, apart from military considerations, the present aircraft personnel (English or French and certain selected officers excepted) with foreign contingents participating in operations in Hejaz, but not entering reserved or sacred areas, was or was not objectionable on political grounds. wo attenes, he said, were included in the French contingent, and they might supply the present urgent need of Arabs for artillery, and so make it unnecessary to ask for a battery of mountain guns from Egypt, which could be ill spared. io this C.L.G.S. replied on the 23rd October, saying that the War Committee’s mien ion was to eep the number of Christians landed in Hejaz as low as possible, for winch reason it would be advisable that the escort sent with the Aeroplanes (should u 6 U t 6 ^ ^ Mohammedan. Aircraft technical personnel might be European, but this should be kept at the minimum necessary for efficiency; any Europeans with le oreign con urgent^ should only be sent to Hejaz if their services should be required oi some specific technical work which Mohammedans could not do.To sum up :— 1. Disregarding the opinions of Colonel Parker, Colonel Wilson, and the Sirdar, the War Committee has decided that neither British troops nor Moslem roops from Sudan shall be sent to Hejaz ; this decision being based both ^ on military and political grounds. That so far as may be consistent with other claims the Sherif may be furnished with necessary munitions and supplies. Aircraft, too may be sent; and the technical personnel may be European, but t ns should be kept at the minimum necessary for efficiency, and only sent a ^° r technical work which could not be done by Moslems, s to ra opinion—Aziz expressed the opinion that a British brigade was unnecessary, and that the sending of it would be imprudent; Ali that blunder ° ne? Un ^ er ^ m P er ^ ous necessity, would be a heavy 2 . 3. French Rely for the Sherif. Sm H McMahon telegraphed [No. 912] on the 18th October that the French military attacne m Cairo had been informed that the steamship “ Mazon ” left Marseilles 2^ e , , c 0 er W1 ^h 400 troops and 800 tons of arms, ammunitions, and stores, hive days later he transmitted a [No. 929J telegram, sent by Colonel Wilson to the ir ar. n is, Colonel Wilson said that Colonel Bremond had informed him that eight machine-gun sections (four horse and four mule), in all sixteen guns, had left Maiseilles on the 19th October ; but that the date of sailing of the remainder of the contingent was unknown. The whole contingent would disembark at Suez and remain there pending developments. On the 19th October the French military attache wrote to the D.M.O. saying that / he had communicated to the French Minister for War the note in which the British Government insisted that no European should form part of the Moslem troops supplied u un 1106 ^° r t ^ e t ^ e ^ er ^- Orders have been given that the technical units shall be composed, as far as possible, of Mohammedans ; but, where strictly indipensable, they will be provided with French officers and technicians. Colonel Br^mond is quite opposed to the penetration into Arabia of the French Staff, which might be kept at Port Sudan. Colonel de La Panouse concludes : “You may then rest assured that no Europeans will enter into Arabia as long as Lieutenant-Colonel Bremond will not be entirely in agreement with the British authorities on this point, and so long as necessity does not require it.” In regard to this point, Sir H. McMahon on the 21 st October transmitted [No. 924] a telpgram from the Sirdar in which he said that he had instructed Colonel Wilson to advise Colonol Bremond that it appeared desirable that as soon as possible the Christian personnel should be eliminated from the French contingent, and that, in any case, such personnel would not be permitted to go inland. This probably explained the meaning of a passage in a telegram sent on the 21st October to C.l.G.S. by the Sirdar, who said that he had instructed Colonel Wilson that^ he should be prepared to advise Colonel Bremond that the elimination as soon as possible of the French contingent appeared advisable. On the 23rd October Sir H. McMahon transmitted [No. 929], as stated above, a telegram sent to the Sirdar by Colonel Wilson, who reported Colonel Bremond’s opinion on this point, and on that of the necessity for infantry support. Colonel Bremond showed Colonel Wilson a despatch from the French Foreign Office saying that the contingent must be composed exclusively of Moslems, but he expressed the opinion that neither French Moslem artillery nor infantry could be used without their French Christian officers, except in a great emergency and at great risk, and appeared to think that French Christian officers must accompany any troops sent to Babegh. He further gave it as his opinion that the contingent could not land there without infantry supports, and said that he had telegraphed to his Government saying that a brigade of infantry was needed to hold Babegh, and that he presumed that the British and French Govern ments were arranging as to the troops to be sent. Colonel Wilson suggested to the Sirdar that the French Government should be asked to lend a mountain battery to the Sherif without personnel, and that it should be sent to Babegh. He thought French assistance, as at present arranged, of “ somewhat negligible utility.”6 Indian Officers* Visit to the Sherif, The Arab Bureau telegraphed [A.B. 35] to D.M.T. on the 19th October that these two Indian officers had returned to Egypt. Their mission had been highly successful, and they now asked for six months in India. The Bureau added that after^ making arrangements for them, Captain Bray would bring home his report in person,' as he had left Jeddah before the arrival of the permission for him to remain another month with Colonel Wilson. The Pilgrimage. On the 15th October Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 903] that information had been received from Jeddah that the Egyptian mahmal and pilgrimage had returned safely from Mecca on the 14th, and on the L 6 th he telegraphed [No. 906] that the mahmai and pilgrims had left Jeddah by ship on the previous day. There had been no cholera during the pilgrimage and only one death, which was due to ordinary disease. The French pilgrims were to leave on the following day, and their medical officers reported that there had been no sickness during the pilgrimage. In reply, on the 17th October, the Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 830] that he regarded it of the greatest importance that a long and detailed communique should be at once issued to the native and to the European press, laying great stress on the importance of the pilgrimage which had been successfully concluded l he instructed Sir H. McMahon to act accordingly. But on the 20 th October the Secretary of State telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon [No. 846] that he should defer. action, as the French Government wished that there should be no mention in the Allied press of the return of the Jrench Moslem pilgrims, and that any information should be withheld which could give the enemy, even indirectly^ a clue as to their itinerary or date of sailing. Colonel Parker. The position of this officer is defined by the report of the Arab Bureau for September, in which the following passage occurs :— “ Consequent on the decision to despatch a flight of aeroplanes to Babegh, Colonel Parker has been installed there as political officer. He is being provided with an Egyptian army officer who speaks English and an interpreter. Though primarily placed there to act as political adviser to the flight commander in his relations with the Arabs and to keep the High Commissioner in touch with the current situation he will be in a position to gain valuable information about the country and its people, which will be reproduced in the second edition of the Hejaz handbook.” IBN RASHID. The Arab Bureau telegraphed to D.M.I. on the 17th October that several notables of Ibn Rashid’s tribes had attended the pilgrimage ceremonies. Ibn Rashid himself is considered hopeless by the Sherif, who thinks, however, that his cause has progressed among these tribes. But on the 22nd October Abdulla informed Colonel Wilson that a force from Ibn Rashid had been defeated by a party of Harb east of Medina. * IBN SAUD. Colonel Wilson says in his report, dated the 28th September [see Appendix B], that 600 of Ibn Saud’s men have been for some weeks with Ali. MASKAT. ' .[Nil.] KOWEYT AND TBE TRUCIAL COAST.

The Shaykh asked for ms stipend, which has not been paid since March last, and was told that it had been suspended pending investigation into his conduct. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. An Arab Newspaper for Propaganda Purposes. General Clayton, having estimated that the initial expenses in connection with such a paper would be 607, and the monthly cost 2007, the Foreign and India Offices have each agreed to provide (1) half the initial expense, up to a maximum of 307, and ( 2 ) half the monthly cost, up to a maximum of 1007, for a period of three months, when the matter will be reconsidered. Arab Bureau. The report for September says that considerable progress has been made with the maps of Syria ; that Lieutenant Nalder, R.N.V.R., political officer of the Red Sea patrol, has been instructed to make a special study of Yemen and Asir; that Colonel Parker, at Rabegh, is in a position to gain valuable information about the country and its people which will be reproduced in the second edition of the Hejaz handbook ; and that Mr. Young, at Jeddah, is also collecting materials for this in his spare time. It was also noted that Captain Ormsby Gore had been lent to the Bureau for the period of the war, and that he would devote himself chiefly to arranging for the military needs of the Sherif and in writing on connected history of Arabian affairs since the beginning of the war. Moslem Prisoners of War.the last two months, large numbers of Mohammedan prisoners of war had been enlisted by the Germans and sent against the Tlussians ; that there had been an increase of propaganda among the prisoners ; and that a supposed Turkish division was believed to consist chiefly of Moroccan, Algerian, and Sudanese prisoners. D.M.I. suggests that perhaps the 55th Division is disposed of by this. ^ The German Society Islam Kultar. An agent reports that this society held a meeting in Berlin on the 10th September under the presidency of Enver: among those present were the heads of Islam propaganda m Afghanistan, Persia, and Central Asia, the Moslem attache with the German Emperor, and delegates of the Committee of Union and Progress, of the Egyptian nationalists, and of the Senussi. Besolutions were passed for the despatch of Fedei to assassinate the Mohammedan rulers and notables on the side of the Allies ; the list of whom included the Sultans of Egypt and Morocco, several Indian princes, the heads of the Turkish opposition in Egypt, and Sherif Pasha. Enemy Propaganda. $ Mr. Joseph King, M.P., has been fined 1001. with 25 guineas costs, for writing to Mr. Bafiblovitch giving information forbidden by the Defence of the Bealm Act. — 1 1 —— APPENDIX (A). Extract from Private Letter from His Highness the Aga Khan, dated October 11, 1916. ****** I FEEL it my duty as a loyal subject of His Majesty and as one who has but one political ambition namely to serve His Majesty to the best of his ability, to place before you and on record what I feel is the shortest and safest way to victory in this war. I am not marking this private so that you may use it in placing it before the highest powers that be. My qualifications for holding decided opinions on questions of this nature may well be doubted, but I have studied the war and its course and specially enemy arms and objects with greater thoroughness than most people, and have also been well au courant of Turkish (modern Turkish) mentality, and for years before the war, both in France and Switzerland, made a close study of Turkish and Persians of the class that rules and leads these unhappy lands and also how stoutly German and Austrian influence grew on their minds. Well, I have no doubt in my own mind as to what Germany is fighting for and what she will go on fighting for. Even if she begs for peacj and offers and gives all we ask of her in France and Belgium, her diplomatists will try and bring about such a situation as will give her middle Europe and Near East supremacy. This view is represented by the class that in Germany expects and has expected Turkey to be her colony. 1 am by no means alone in holding this view of German ambition. The best Swiss, Norwegian, and other neutral and pro-Ally observers and writers agree with this. Besides, though I have no doubt that we can and will beat her in a military sense in the West, yet it may very well last two years more, and the prospect of the United Kingdom being crippled in men and money to put Germany out—after all only one rival amongst many others (Japan and Russia are both potential and possible Germanys)—does not appeal to me. And besides we must not forget the oldest dictum of human experience in difficulties—a knot can be untied most easily at its weakest point. These considerations moved me last year to place before His Majesty’s Ministers, through the India Office, a memorandum on Turkey urging a separate peace. Paradoxical as it may appear, the alternative of a stunning and killing blow at Turkey and peace and protection of Turkey come to the same thing as far as results are concerned—the elimination of Turkey in this war and her falling within the Anglo-French sphere of economic develop ment after the war. (I do not mean Armenia, of course, which in any case is a natural Bussian province.) .... The Dardanelles expedition failed because we wentthere too late and too soon. We did not wait till the Turks had gone well into the Armenian expedition nor into the Egyptian or the Galician business. And we went to work with people who knew little of Turkish mentality or drew their conclusions like some of our youthful authorities on Turkish and Arabian affairs from their own inner ^romantic natures aided by travel and the reading of the Arabian Nights. The Mesopotamian expedition had a legitimate half that did succeed and admirably, namely, it was necessary and important to get hold of Basra and the head waters of the Gulf and such inland positions as made the Shat-el-Arab a British waterway. But the second part, the move to Bagdad, was useless even if it succeeded for Bagdad and Erzeroom and Mecca are limbs and not the heart of Turkey and the modern governing Turk is neither a sentimental nor a romantic Moslem, but will go on fighting for his German-made ideals, even if such “ Holv ” limbs are cut off. From the larger point of Moslem sentiment too, I feel that the ultimate solution of Turkish-Caliphate questions is not much aided or advanced by amputations of Bagdad or Mecca. So the part of the Mesopotamian expedition that failed was the illegitimate second half, which was not worth the risks. We must give a blow much further up, much nearer the heart of the Turkish Empire, if we want to put the weakest member of the enemy group out of the combat If it is decided later on to try a knock-out blow or a separate peace—and I again repeat both come to the same thing in results —-then I place my experience and knowledge, and all I have, entirely and fully at His Majesty, my master and Emperor’s disposal. Please place my full offer of services before His Majesty’s Throne’s-steps. I have purposely loitered on in Europe for months since my return from India because I have not any direct or immediate work now in India, my affairs there being on sound foundations, and because I think I may have a chance of serving His Majesty in Turkish affairs, just as happily I was able to do in Persian affairs last year when the Zil returned, and when at least the governing and Court lot in Tehran were freed from German influence, and to a certain extent by my humble writings, and suggestions. Well, if later a real knock-out on Turkey is decided, I am entirely at your call, or for a separate peace, for I have always held both come to the same result. I daresay our military and other authorities are as yet too busy with the Western objectives to give a serious consideration to the weakest point theory, but if it is ever decided on I am at your call. Half measures are no use. Since I got your letter, and I saw there is no immediate chance of my being able to serve the Government, I have postponed my return to England and will go on to Nice and wait, in case you ever decide on sending for me. I do not like the idea of travelling for nothing tangible in these days, and of taking up the place of useful voyagers on Boulogne boats, nor crossing the sea for nothing. Besides, I will take this good chance of going through a small but long-drawn and neglected operation on on ankle that I broke playing tennis last summer. P.S.—I like to make it quite clear that no half-and-half expedition with numbers that are not overwhelming, and without munition and naval and shipping support of unprecedented extent, will do any good. To send 100,000 men to Syria or Anatolia is useless, for such an expedition will be only a limb cutting, and not a knock-out blow.APPENDIX (B). Colonel Wilson’s Reports. Report of Meeting with the Sherif Faisal Bey at Yambo, August 27 and 28, 1916. I LEFT Jeddah on the 21st August in H.M.S. “ Hardinge” (Commander Linbury, R.N.,) and arrived Yambo at 9 A.M. on the 25th. Shaykh Abdel Khader Abdu who acts as private representive of the Sberif at Yambo, came and saw me at once, I gave him a letter for Faisal Bey in which I stated I was coming to his camp, this letter was passed to El Said Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Bedawi (the official representative of the Sherif) a man I did not trust and who was looked upon with contempt by the other chiefs. He sent my letter off but at the same time, as Faisal found out afterwards, sent a message to the Turks to warn them of my intended visit to Faisal’s camp. Faisal is sending the man to Mecca on some excuse and is informing the Sherif who will deal with him there. I tried to leave on the afternoon of the 25th and again on the 26th, but was always met with excuses for delay the reason for which is now of course apparent. On the afternoon of the 26th Sherif Abdullah Ibn Tawaad, a trusted friend and relation of Faisal’s who is collecting Arab recruits at Yambo, came to see me and at once arranged that I should leave the next morning with an escort of 150 Ashraf Shaykhs and men. While he was with me I received a reply from Faisal to say that he was on his way to Yanbo and would arrive early the next morning the 27th. I arranged to ride out to meet him and left at 6 A.M. with Sherif Abdullah accompanied by some 80 Shaykhs, 150 camelmen, and about 800 Arab riflemen. We went out about 4 miles until we met Faisal who was escorted by about 200 camelmen and horsemen and after greetings between the tv^o parties which included an inspiring speech from Hussein Rouhi to everyone in general we returned to Yambo, Faisal and I riding together. He accompanied me on board H.M.S. “ Dufferin ” for some light refreshment when it was arranged for further meetings, one for 3 P.M. that afternoon, which lasted till 8 P.M,, and another on the morning of the 28th, which lasted from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. Faisal is about 28 years of age, and struck me as being an exceedingly nice man, well educated, and altogether impressing me very favourably. Though he may at times, perhaps, be inclined to exaggerate matters it is clear he regards his position as verv critical, and I think there is no doubt that it is so. j ' % He opened by saying that he would like to start from the beginning, to which I assented, and kept notes throughout. The following is practically what he said He had written from Syria to the Sherif in May, strongly urging that the revolt should not take place for at least two months; before, however, he got a reply to this he was ordered back to Hejaz, and seven days after his return the revolt broke out. When the revolt occurred, numerous tribes joined at once; some had only old guns, and others only flint-locks. He attacked the Turks on the railway and pulled up lengths of the line, but lack of arms forced him later on to leave the neighbourhood of the railway, and he therefore sent messengers to all tribes with wdiom he could get into touch to obtain ammunition, and urgent messages to the Sherif, stating that no proper attack on Medina could take place owing to lack of arms. He proceeded to destroy the railway in various places, dividing his force into three parties, one close to Medina, another at Dursieh (10 kilometres north of Medina), and the third at Hafira (40 miles north of Medina), his object being to capture - the forts at Bowat and Hafira. Eventually he was forced to abandon this idea, since each night the Turks repaired the damage done with the aid of construction and armoured trains against which he could not compete.;) His original intention was to go to Medain Salih, where he expected rifles to be sent him for arming the Anazeh and the Geheina tribes, but as none were forthcoming he was forced to remain with Ali Bey.Most of the Anazeh Shaykhs remained waiting a long time near the railway, and Faisal continued to send them messages that arms would surely come next week, &amp;c., until at last the tribes and others began telling him : ‘‘You promise arms and food and none come ” ; the result being that they have now all dispersed. ■'&gt; He hoped Great Britain would help quickly and to the utmost limit, and he blamed ohe Sherif for not realising the seriousness of the situation, even at the beginning of the revolt. Early in July he was only a few miles from Medina, and saw the Turkish reinforcements arriving. He and Ali consulted together as to whether they would remain where they were or retire, since the Turks were beginning to come out of Medina; they decided to remain, hoping that arms and guns would be sent before the Turks really attacked. At this time they had three camps of 10,000 Arabs each, but not one camp had 2,000 good rifles. About the middle of July the Turks began to attack, and heavy fighting occurred for most of the day until the Arabs had no ammunition left. Ali then ordered a retirement to Ghadir Rageh (about 14 miles south of Medina). Soon afterwards 500 Japanese rifles arrived, which they could not use, as the ammunition sometimes did not fit, and many were broken. Faisal thinks Shaykh Hussein, of Babegh, did this. Ali ordered Faisal to go northwards, as otherwise the Arabs might leave him; he went to the Sultani Boad and the Beni Salim joined him there ; Ali remained in the Beni Maoruh country. Their retreat was solely due to want of arms, and they began to think that the British Government and the Sherif had forgotten all about the Medina operations. Early in August Faisal received 2,500 English rifles, which they like very much. He was hoping for more but none have come, and his Arabs have begun to lose heart. About this time the Turks proclaimed Haidar Pasha as Emir and Grand Sherif of Mecca, and during the last month gold has been lavished right and left among the tribes. Up to the 21st August there has been continual fighting since the end of July, Faisal gradually retiring every now and then, by which means he increases the length of the Turkish line of communication with Medina. The force opposite him consists, he is certain, of three allai (about 9,000 men), with an independent Tabour, an allai of camelry (about 700 men), and cavalry (500); roughly about 1,200. About 6,000 against Ali Bey and 6,000 in Medina and in lines of communication. (By careful cross-examination, these figures may be checked fairly accurately by questioning the Turkish Yusbashi who left in H.M.S. “ Scotia” yesterday for Suez with seven privates.) Faisal has been gradually recreating along the Sultani Boad, and his main head quarters are now at Khaif, which commands the road at Bir Abbas, the nearest gorge in the mountains, after which the road opens out down to the sea coast. It is now impossible for him to push the Turks back, and if the latter make a really strong and sustained attack he states they will succeed in breaking through, in which case he fears most of his Arabs will disperse, but in this event he himself, with all who remain with him will keep harrying the Turkish rear and lines of communication. As Ali found that the force opposite him at Hafer was acting on the defensive, he decided to make a bold sweeping movement, to try and get between Medina and the Turks who are against Faisal. Ali left Hafer on the 26th August, and it will take him at least ten days to get round. Faisal lays great stress upon having some trained troops with him, or even at Yambo or Babegh, which would enable him to try and take the offensive and enor mously encourage the Arabs, many of whom do not yet believe that Great Britain is really backing the Sherif. These Arabs say that Great Britain is stronger than Germany, and ask why she does not help. Faisal asked that Great Britain should do for the Arabs one-tenth of what the Germans are doing for the Turks. I asked Faisal if he would like the Arab capital, army, and country to be under the British Government, as the Turkish Empire is now under Germany. To this, of course, he replied “ No.” i i ii a u I asked him if he knew of all the British Government had done to help the Arabs. He replied expressing his ignorance. _ I then proceeded to tell him that trained men for blowing up the railway had been sent to Port Sudan, but were stopped from coming across by the Sherif: that dynamitefor them to use had been sent back by the Sherii from Jeddah : that sixty odd boxes of bombs had been on board a warship for weeks, as the Sherif said he did not want them landed. I told them all this, thinking it as well for Faisal to know that all the blame tor the shortage of munitions did not lie at the door of the British Government. Faisal went as near cursing his saintly father as I suppose a son of a Grand Sherif could, and added : “ My father tries to do everything, but is not a soldier.” Having had a month’s experience of the old gentleman I was able to agree cordially. Faisal stated that he considered his position most critical, and that he dare not return to his troops until he could tell them help was coming ; I do not know if I succeeded in persuading him to give up this absurd attitude, but I did my best. He said that he had suggested to the Sherif that he and his force should leave the Medina district and go to Mecca in readiness to defend it. On being told that the Sherif objected to British officers coming with Egyptian troops unless dressed as Arabs, he swore and assured me that if British troops landed and put on Arab cloaks he would them [sic] to discard them, as what he wanted was to show the Arabs that Great Britain was really helping, which knowledge would do an enormous amount to buck up the Arabs, and would make “ fence-sitter^ ” get down on the Sherif’s side. All Arabs loathe the Turks, and have the greatest opinion of the might of Great Britain. He formulated his urgent requests as follows :— 1. Three thousand trained troops to represent Great Britain, even at Yambo or Rabegh. 2. Aeroplanes. 3. Permanent cutting of the railway, which would bring in the and have the greatest effect. 4. Mountain- and machine-guns. 5. Rifles. Re 1.— As I telegraphed yesterday the Sherif will only sanction about 300 British troops, who would ostensibly be an escort to the aeroplanes ; if half a battalion could be spaied and stationed at Yambo or Rabegh it would have a good effect. At the former place there is a condenser which requires coal, but at the latter place I have no personal knowledge of the water supply. I shall be in a better position to judge after visiting Rabegh ; but at present I am inclined to think that—providing the water supply can be arranged—Rabegh will be the best place for ths aeroplane depbt and for any troops which may be sent. This would give Faisal a position to fall back upon if the worst happens ; he would also probably have the support of the guns of some patrol ships. Re 2.— I have sent Faisal a letter telling him that aeroplanes are coming, which is excellent news; I have also informed the Sherif, who expressed his gratitude. Re 3.— X quite appreciate the difficulties of the Oommander-in-Chief fArbur’s telenram No. 1.296, dated 30th August). My point is that, in my opinion, the 'permanent cutting of the Hedjaz railway, so as to prevent the despatch of any reinforcements, is (especially now that aeroplanes, guns, and machine guns are coming) the most urgent and important operation necessary at the present moment; whether my various recommendations are possible or not to carry out I have no means of knowing at the time they are made, but I assume it to be my duty to make such as I consider necessary. If the proposed operations north of Yambo turn out alright I am hoping that operations from Akaba will start as soon as Colonel Parker returns to Suez. &amp; Re 4.— Bimbasni Hassan Effendi Zeki arrived yesterday with men and mules, the two guns are expected here about the 6th from Suez, meanwhile I am getting Zeki Effendi on to training Arabs in artillery work. Re 5.— I have persuaded the Sherif to send the whole 5,000 brought by H.M.S. “ Suva ” to Xaisal, and the ‘ Fox is, I believe, bringing the remainder, 2,500. if they remained Northern TribesFaisal informed me that if the railway was cut he would require 15,000 rifles to arm the Anazeh and other tribes who would at once join, but are at present mostly unarmed; I suggest 10,000 be earmarked for this purpose if 15,000 cannot be obtained. ^ I attach a plan drawn by Ituhi’s assistant from a rough plan I worked out with Jaisal; I doubt its accuracy, but it may be of use.* I also attach a message received from S her if which I have no time to type before the mail leaves ; and one from Faisal. Perhaps Arbur could have a suitable tent sent for him. Since the above was written I have received Arbur telegram No. 1301 ot the 31st August, saying that seaplanes, not aeroplanes, are coming. It is a very great disappointment, useful as the former will be for coastal work. There was not a figure wrong in the telegram as received here ; informing the Sherif and Faisal will not be a very pleasant task. HM.S. “Scotia” left at noon yesterday before receipt of the above telegram, and I propose to meet the S.N.O., as stated in my letter sent by “ Scotia,” and get to Suez the first opportunity. The wTiole of this town is seething with unrest, constant rumours arrive from Rabegh that the Turks are advancing; several of Haidar’s proclamations have been brought in, and a reverse to Faisal would have a very bad effect and possibly would prevent any pilgrims leaving here for Mecca. I am well aware that the fate of Arabia and all other spheres of operations depends on our success on the Western Front, and that even if the Turks reoccupy Hejaz, Arabia—after the war—will be free and independent; but to allow this to take place will not tend to make the Sherif and Arab chiefs our loyal and faithful friends, and will seriously impair our prestige and influence in the future, to retain and gam which, is surely worth an effort now. C. WILSON, Lieutenant-Colonel. Jeddah, September 1, 1916. i^) (Secret.) (Despatch No. 5.) , ^ gi r&gt; Jeddah, September 28, 1916. I have the honour to repeat that I arrived at Jeddah on the 24th September at 4 p.m. . ^ -o i u I reached Yambo the 21st September and left the same evening for Rabegh, arriving there on the 22nd September. , I met Faisal Bey at Yambo, and learnt from him that his brother, Ah Bey, had arrived at Rabegh; it being obvious that the two brothers had no real plan o co-operation, I managed to persuade Faisal Bey to accompany me to Rabegh to consu t his brother and come to some definite agreement. On arriving at Rabegh, Ali Bey, Zeid Bey (recently arrived from Quadima), and Nuri Bey came on board ; shortly afterwards Aziz Bey el Masri arrived, and jome the conference with the above, which 1 purposely did not attend. . The conference lasted from 9-30 a.m. to 2-30 p.m., during most of which time Zeid Bey was not allowed to be present. _ , . . After the conference Ali and Faisal saw me privately and told t e ecision come to, &amp;c., after which Faisal returned to Yambo in H.M.S. Northbrook, ycoui esy of Captain Boyle, R.N., S.N.O. tvt i On the 22nd I landed with Captain Boyle, R.N., and the two Nava or P 8 officers who were on board H.M.S. “ Dufferin,”' to ascertain if a suitable site dor an aeroplane camp could be found. I informed your Excellency by telegram b. o the 22nd September of the result. i . , . . . u I had a private talk with Aziz Bey, and went over the mornings ecision wi him; the various requests he made were telegraphed to your Excellency (my o ^I^DefenTelaemefor Rabegh consists of an entrenched position N W.W. and N.E, of the village and palm grove, it is 6,500-8,000 yards from the anc orage an guards the water supply and is astride of the Sultani Road. Sent to Arab Bureau. 898—14' EI i mil! I The telephone wire, &amp;c., asked for is to connect three fortified posts with a central reserve in the rear and another line to the aeroplane camp and ships. The entrenching tools are urgently required as are also the Q.F. guns as Ali Bey has only three guns including one of those recently captured from the Turks. I gave Ali Bey the five Colt and the remaining five German Maxims (two of th^ latter I gave Faisal); 2,500 rifles for himself and 1,000 for fiaisal. . . The general idea in case of a Turkish advance down the Sultam Boad was given in my telegram 0210 of the 22nd September to your Excellency. The places named—with the exception of Hakshush—are, I think, marked on the plan I produced at the Ismailia conference, which the G.O.C. C.-in-C. retained and promised to forward copies which your Excellency has probably received. The patrol ships guard the flanks of the Arab position, and if three Q.F. batteries complete are sent (Nuri Bey assured me he could find personnel for them) the Arabs should be able to hold their own if they keep a good heart and really fight; on the other hand they may get a knock and give up the struggle ; the fall of Taif has had an excellent effect and the morale of the Arabs generally is certainly improved since 1 first saw Faisal. 1 left Captain Bray, 18th Bengal Lancers, at Rabegh as my representative where he will be most useful as a liason officer between Ali and the R.F.C. detachment and in many other ways. 1 hope that your Excellency will obtain permission for this officer to remain at my disposal for a month or so at least ; he is very keen on the work, and is just the type of officer I require. Aziz Bey and Nuri Bey particularly ask that the following officers be sent as soon as possible :— 1 Said Mahmud. —An artillery officer with the Sultan of Maskat. Aziz Bey asks that a letter may be sent to the Sultan asking for the loan of this officer’s services for a few months, together with any of his friends, who would all return after a few months. Yuzbashi Rashid, Mulazim Rasim. —These two officers were prisoners in India, and according to Aziz Bey did not come to Jeddah with the Arab prisoners from Egypt last month owing to a misunderstanding, but are both quite trustworthy and keen to come. Gaafar Pasha. —Aziz Bey is very anxious for him to come, which form thinks he would like to, and states that Gaafar Pasha would be absolutely loyal to the Shenf. If he comes, Aziz wishes him to be given a chance of talking to the Arab prisoners, as several may be willing to come and serve with Gaafar Pasha. Taif. % I gather from Aziz Bey and the Egyptian officers now with Faisal who came from Taif, that the Sherif and the conduct of the Arabs are the reasons of the long delay. The Sherif wished to capture the place without bloodshed or destruction of houses, but the Arabs could not be got to make an assault. I am glad to say that I do not consider that blame attaches to Said Pasha Ali for the lengthy operations. Wedj. Sheikh Saad Ghoneim, of the Geheina, was to leave Yambo on the 22nd instant with 1,200 camelry to raid the Billi country which he will probably do thoroughly. Turkish Dispositions. From several talks with Nuri Bey, I gather that the total force under Fakri Pasha amounts to about 15,000 men, distributed as follows :— 1. On the Faree and Ghayer roads from Bir El Mashi to El Hafe: 1 regiment. 2 mountain guns. 4 machine guns. 2. Medina and immediate neighbourhood : same as 1, with a certain number of old field guns in forts.3. Bir El Dervish (Sultani Road Force) : a full division (3 regiments). 4 mountain quick-firing batteries of recent make. 7 field-guns (fairly modern). 12 machine guns. 1 squadron Cavalry. 1 company Camel Corps (about 500 strong). The regiments have been brought up to full strength (3,000) by gendarmerie, Arabs, and scallywags. Regular Army probably 60 per cent. The morale of the force is not good, supplies are short, and transport increasing!v diffacult for the enemy to obtain. The luikish communications are daily harassed by Arab parties, many of whom do not belong to the Sherif s forces, but are working on their own. Nun Bey obtained this information ve the lurkish force from the Arab officers who recently deserted from the enemy. i Turkish Mahmal. Nuri Bey does not think the Mahmal has arrived at Medina ; its special escort reached there about the 2nd September or earlier, which possibly accounts for the report that it had actually arrived; if it arrives Ali Bey proposes to offer to take it over and guarantee its safety to Mecca. Ibn Saud. Six hundred of his men have been some weeks with Ali Bey. I could obtain no confirmation of the report that Ibn Rashid had sent a force* to attack the Harb. / Medina Railway. Faisal Bey informed me that 3,000 Geheina are now north of Medina, near the railway, between Bewat and Hadiyah, to prevent any Turkish force coming to Yanbo b 7 a road from Bewat which runs north of the Sultani Road Shaykh Assaaf (who went to Suez for instruction in the use of explosives) and his men will work with the above force, and has been instructed to endeavour to destroy the railway engines. I handed over the gelignite, &amp;c., to Sheikh Assaaf at Yambo, and he now has everything he requires. General. One of the two Turkish guns sent on H.M.S. “ Dufferin ” had no elevating wheel. Nuri Bey is only taking one with the spare parts of the other, as the ammunition available is not enough for the two. The second gun will be taken to Suez by H.M.S. “Dufferin” for delivery to the G.O.C.-in-C., who, I think, expressed a wish to have them back if possible. The full discussion between Ali and Faisal and the opportune presence of Aziz Bey has, I think, done a lot of good and cleared the air. Hussein of Rabegh. Left Rabegh when he heard that Ali Bey was approaching._ He has written letters to the latter to say that he cannot come into Rabegh, but that if the Turks advance he will attack them. Ali Bey has now refused to have anything more to do with him until Hussein goes to Mecca and sees the Sherif. His action in running away, after taking the oath of loyalty, instead of fighting Zeid Bey, has done much to discredit him. Arabs desert him daily and a nephew of his, who is in Ali s camp with about 800 of the tribe, will probably be appointed Shaykh in Hussein s place, if he proves himself loyal to the Sherif. French Mission. The mission had an excellent reception on their arrival at Jeddah, which included two public dinners of eighty covers. i . . Aziz Bey appears to be somewhat concerned as to the object of the mission. I told16 him it was an act of courtesy to the Sherif on behalf of our Ally. He also volunteered the information that, after the fall of Medina, he and Abdulla Bey would go to Egypt, endeavour to have a secret meeting with your Excellency on the subject of Syria and French aims there, with the idea of making a secret treaty between the British Government and the Sherif, after which he would return to Mecca. The fact of his going to Egypt was to be a deep secret. After remarking that it would be better to wait until Medina was captured before making any plans, I changed the subject. In addition to Colonel Bremond and his two othcers, M. de Bettel (French Consul at Jeddah up to the outbreak of war) is also of the party. He informed me that he was here in an unofficial capacity only, but I would have preferred his absence at the present time. Colonel Bremond informed me that the mission had an excellent reception at Mecca; he and his staff (which is, I hear, to be considerably augmented) are occupying the French Consulate, which, of course, flies the Tricolour. Egyptiaji Mahmal. H.M.S. “ Hardinge ” arrived on the 26th instant, and she and H.M.S. “ Fox” fired salutes to which the shore saluting battery replied. H.M.S. “ Euryalus,” with his Excellency the Admiral Commander-in-Chief, arrived later in the day. All ships were “ dressed.” All the Egyptian army escort with the exception of some horses were landed on the 27th, and the Mahmal itself at 7 A.M. to-day (28th), being saluted by the flagship as it left H.M.S. “ Hardinge.” 6 F I went on board H.M.S. “ Hardinge ” on her arrival to call on El Emir El Haj (Lewa Ahmed Fetin Pasha). A fine-looking Egyptian guard of honour received me. The Emir particularly expressed his grateful thanks and appreciation for all the arrangements made on board, and the treatment he and the escort had received from Commander Linberry, R.N., Commanding H.M.S. “ Hardinge.” His Excellency the Admiral Commander-in-Chief, with his staff, came ashore before the Mahmal to assist in its reception. On the morning of the 27th the Admiral Commander-in-Chief and his staff came ashore to call on Sherif Mehsen Ibn Mansur (the Sherif’s representative), who met his Excellency on landing. The shore battery fired a salute, and two guards of honour (new levees and police) were paraded to receive his Excellency. A procession was formed to the Government officer, and from there His Excellency proceeded to the french Consulate and visited the British Consulate before returning to the flagship. In the afternoon, at the invitation of his Excellency, the Sherif Mehsen and various notables came off to the flagship and were shown the guns, &amp;c., by his Excellency himself. They were very greatly impressed. It is difficult for me to adequately express the excellent effect of his Excellency’s visit which has made a very great impression and will be of immense assistance to me, especially after the reception accorded the French mission, the effect of which has now been entirely eclipsed. The fact that in the first year of the new regime, the Mahmal was brought in one of His Majesty s Ships and saluted in the harbour by three British warships, coupled with the piesence of his Excellency the C.-m-C. has not been missed by leading people of Jeddah and has caused genuine satisfaction. I am both glad and relieved to hear from Colonel Parker that he remains at Rabegh. The strain of trying to deal with the Arab military operations from Jeddah as well as with the very numerous other matters with only two Civil British Assistants, has been very great. 1 return to Jeddah on the 30th and shall report on the result of the visit to Rabegh with his Excellency the Admiral C.-m-C. as soon as possible, meanwhile Mr. Storrs, C.M.G., will be able to give your Excellency the result personally in a few days, as I understand he returns direct to Suez from Rabegh.

Just after finishing my letter to you I have received the enclosed letters from Hussein-ibn-Mebeirik, which are sufficient for you to peruse. I gathered from them that suspicion related to him does not exist at all, and if anything that you should go to Babegh to prevent any danger which may appear in case of rebel. The way will be smoothed. The communication will be safe and the result desired by Faisal will take place. Consequently you should proceed to Babegh with the blessing of God. This is indeed a sign of prosperity. If possible you can give a letter to Hussein Buhi to inform him all about the matter, telling him that he may come to meet you at Babegh for the purpose of salutation, and that he may stay one day or two with you there. If he has some work to do he can go and come back to you. This is what I thought satisfactory and no better opinion than that Try to let Beni Bishr and Beni Hussein to avoid such mendacity and other things that may happen. Bead this letter to Mohammed-ibn-Hamaadi, warning against such things, and tell him that such this must be of the elusion of Bishr. W rite a letter to Hussein Buhi and leave it with a special man whom Ahmed or El Sayid may choose, and he is to wait at the harbour. You can tell him the matter is prosperous without fighting, and that there must be a ship to frighten the people. Be very careful in this matter, and write to your brother Faisal, either by wireless or by a special messenger, that you have occupied Babegh, and that you are there with your troops. Tell Hussein Buhi to send you the gun with its men, ammunition and mules,, which we had sent to Yambo with the troops, and to bring you also the guns which were sent to Suez for repair.

Mote .—Time after time I have pointed out to the Sherif the very great importance of sending Eeisal as many guns as can possibly be spared from Taif; also that a general assault should be made on the Turkish positions, pointing out that if it is true that the Turks are in such a bad state as Said always reports, such action should cause the fall of the town. C. E W. September 1, 1916. Telegram from Sherif to Wilson Pasha. His Excellency the British Agent in Jeddah. September 1, 1916. I have given strict orders to whomsoever it may concern at Taif, to send the mule guns and Maxims which you asked for. The arrival of the above will be about ten [898 14J G20 days from date. I think it is necessary to send the guns coming from Suez to Faisal as soon as possible, because their arrival there will create a rumour which will be a good means of contending with so many important and unexpected events. I must emphasise to his Excellency the British Agent that I did not in the beginning accept more than two guns from each battery on their arrival at Jeddah, which I thought better, but you refused to separate them from the batteries, showing that it was impossible. Now I wish it to be understood that if there was any objection whatever in sending the guns from Taif, it was for the above-mentioned reasons only. The guns will arrive in the time given above, by the will of God. The Sherif and Emir of Mecca, HUSSEIN. * A Message from Ghalib Pasha, the Commander of the Turkish Troops at Taif, to Abdulla Bey, the Son of the Sherif. [The original in Turkish.] To His Excellency Abdulla Bey, the Commander of the Eastern Troops in Hejaz. Excellency, Taif, 2Mh Keida, 1334. All the operations which you have made from the beginning of the battle were strategically necessary, as I explained in my former message, which I forwarded a week ago to his Highness the Grand Sherif of Mecca through your Excellency, and it is useless to continue the defence and shedding blood after we have understood your real aims and intentions, and we have begged the solving of this problem and settling the result of this war according to the principles of humanity and Mohammedism. Our aims in begging you to send us with our arms to Medina was that you may show to the civilised nations of the world an example of the high principles of Islam. In consequence of this, and as there are no provisions and ammunition, to avoid the shedding of blood, I prefer to leave off the quarrel and to stop continuing the war. If it suits your Excellency, I will send to you representatives to make the agree ments, or you may send us representatives from your side. Accept my great respects, GHALIB, Commander of the Turkish Troops at Taif, Telegram, His Excellency the British Agent at Jeddah. With great pleasure I congratulate you for receiving a letter just now from Farik Ghalib Pasha, the commander of the enemy force at Taif, saying that he wants to surrender, and that is just after our continual daily firing with big and small guns, which weakened the enemy and forced them to surrender at once. I will send you fuller explanations after it is finished. Commander of the Egyptian Force, LEWA SAYID ALY. 2Mh Keida, 1334. The Message of Abdulla Bey to Ghalib Pasha. After titles. I have received your letter with great pleasure, and thank you much for your religious zeal towards Islam, and, in order to avoid quarrel and shedding of blood, I will wait for your representatives to-morrow, Friday, at 4 o’clock, in the former place of the past week at Shoubra, near Bab-el-Basra. Consequently, we will give orders to stop firing in the central points to-morrow, and at the other points after to-morrow, because it is not possible now, and I beg you to accept my great respect. (Signed) ABDULLA.Wilson Pasha to the Sherif. His Highness the Sherif and Emir of Mecca. September 2, 1916. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Highness’s telegram of r^terday, by which I am delighted to see that your Highness has issued orders tor two mule guns and two Maxim guns to be sent here from Taif at once, and that they will arrive in about ten days’ time. I am sure this is the best course to follow, and they will be of the greatest possible use to your son Faisal Bey. When the two guns arrive from Suez I will send Bimb. Zeki Eff. with them, and one howitzer from here to Babegh, as soon as there is a ship to take them. Zeki Efl*. wishes to train twenty-five Arabs for artillery work, and I understand that your Highness is giving orders for these men to be supplied and go with Zeki Eff. Your Highness requires artillerymen, and this is the way to get them. I do not understand your Highness’s reference in your telegram where }mu state that I refused to separate the guns and send some to Medina and some to Taif; possibly there is a mistake in the transmission. As your Highness will no doubt remember I stated on my arrival that I could not arrange for the batteries to be divided until the arrival of Said Bey Ali, their commandant. When he arrived, he did not want to separate the batteries if possible, but when your Highness stated that you particularly wished two gtms to go to Taif and four to Medina I agreed that the four guns and the whole Maxim battery did go to Babegh, but were not allowed to land by Shaykh Hussein’s people ; they therefore returned and joined Said Bey at Mecca. I expect your Highness will also remember that more than once you asked me to return the Maxim battery to Port Sudan, as you did not require it; finally it remained, and has, I understand, been useful at Taif, and will be more than useful to Faisal Bey. Please accept my best salaams, and I beg to inform your Highness that I leave to-morrow and am going to Suez, where you may be sure I shall do all I can in the interests of your Highness’s cause. WILSON PASHA. APPENDIX (C). Miscellaneous Cuttings from the Press. Italy arid Asia Minor. THE “ IdeaNazionale” (13th October), in another leading article on “ The Oversea Bights of Italy,” congratulates itself on having secured the support of “ the best part of the country ” to its programme of “ compensations in Asia Minor.” But Franchetti, in the “ Corriere della Sera,” while agreeing in the main with the “ Idea’s ” desire to see the Ethiopian zone reserved to Italian influence, passes over certain elements necessary to the attainment of that object. Italian influence cannot be paramount so long as other Powers retain control of the traditional caravan route of Zeila, the southern confines of Abyssinia, the coast of Yemen facing Erythrea, and still more the valley of the Suba with the only waterway and the only port commanding the trade of the lower regions of Ethiopia. But still more grave is the seeming acceptance both by Franchetti and by Giuseppe Piazza in the “ Tribuna,” of England’s prescriptive right to the Gulf of Alexandretta.^ The “ Idea” has already explained that the only terms on which Italy could waive her claim to this most important access to one of the great arteries of international trade would be the acquisition in compensation of all Southern and Central Anatolia “ as far as the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora, including the whole development of the railway from the coast as far as west of Sivas.” According to Franchetti and Piazza England’s claim to the Gulf of Alexandretta rests on its possession of Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, and India. ^ As well say that because France and England are going to own three-quarters of Africa, it is logical that they should have the fourth quarter ! . . . Alexandretta is even more important for the development of Anatolia than it is lor that of Mesopotamia, and, though we may waive our claims in favour of England, it would be a mistake to recognise any prescriptive right on the part of England.The “ Idea” then finds great fault with Senator Franchetti for allowing England so large a zone north-west of Alexandretta, a zone stretching 200 kilometres as far as the River Seitun. Even the Pyramus would give an unnecessarily extended limit and would deprive us of the Bay of Ajas. The article goes on to claim “ domination ” for Italy in Asia Minor and to arg|r^ that an end must be put to Turkish rule, in answer to Signor Piazza, who wouiu maintain the.fiction. A continuance of Turkish rule would provide a field for German intrigue and an excuse for a revival of Hellenism, “ that morbid parasite which flourishes on coast regions,’ and threatens Italian expansion. [From the “ Daily Review of the Foreign Press” (W. O.) for 20th October, 1916.] The .Syrian Agitation. According to the u Berliner Tageblatt ” of the 14th October, the Turkish Government has published an official account of the Syrian troubles. It states that a rising was planned and that French officers were to lead the insurgents ; but “ these plans never materialised owing to lack of followers and dissension amongst the conspirators, greatly due to British machinations to spite the French.” 4 O DSECRET. APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARABIAN REPORT No. XIII Series). . ^ ^' Tinks continue to menace Rabegh, but are not showing signs of a very u il )lc a ..' a 1 n . c ^‘ ^ ne y appear to have the advantage of aerial reconnaissance, the moral enect oi which may be considerable when the Turkish machines fly. Ihe Italian official whom it is proposed the Italian Government should send to -Port 011 the situation at Jeddah will be a constant cause of anxiety, he will antaonnise tie Aiabs against the Entente Powers, and be in considerable danger of his life ; it is suggested that his stay should be as short as possible. 1 he successful completion of the Haj pilgrimage should be well boomed in the pi ess in all Entente countries, and especially in India; it is su ggested that Cairo should Abe requesied to issue a full and detailed commu nique cn this subject, and that it should be suffered to appear in the Indian press. Attention is drawn to the proclamation of Ali Plaidar, the Turkish pretender to the fe her hi an odice. It will be observed that he makes much pley with pretended landings of British in Hejaz; doubtless this is written with the intention of influencing the local Arabs, but c s these latter are in a position to know the truth little danger need be apprehended. The results of our divided system of control on Arabian affairs are made very clear in the text ©f a telegram from Aden, and also in a phrase taken from a letter written by Ibn Saud to Sir Percy Cox. Both are here reprinted with certain lines italicised. Telegram from Resident, Aden, to Political Department, Simla. Shaykh Ali, of Birk, has reported through His Majesty’s ship “ Minto ” that on the 27th September the Turks recaptured Comfida, being assisted by the tribes Hali and Yebha, which originally petitioned the Sherif. Sir (?) fled, wounded, after a desperate resistance, and is reported safe with Shaykh Hussain Abdalla, of the Zubeid tribe. Ali Jifri and other refugees from Comfida are now at Birk. Comfida and district, including Muhail(?) goz [next word undeeypherable] are held by from 400 to 600 Turks, with guns and machine-guns. There are now no Idrisi troops near that district, and no large Sherif forces, and in case of a naval demonstration at Comfida the Turks would first evacuate that town and then reoccupy it. Comfida requires no food and is exporting grain, but requires imports of coffee, cloth, and petrol. The “ Minto ” considers this rep ort reliable. For the present I am regarding Gom fida as outside my sphere, as it is supposed to be controlled for the time being bij the Sherif. Extract from Letter of Lbn Saud to C.P.O., Basra. As soon as I was certain of the accuracy of the Sherit’s news, and even before your letter reached me, I had the intention to write to your Honour regardingmy position and circumstances vis-d-vis the Sherif, and also regarding the questions which affect you in this connection. I feel it incumbent on me to state to you (though you are much better informed in regard to the affair than I am) that my fear is that the Sherif may obtain from the British Government an undertaking for his independent control over Hejaz and the Arabs. Although you yourself 'probably appreciate my fears, it' is possible that the representative of the British Governme nt, who is actually conducting negotiations with the Sherif, is not acquainted with the position. The telegram exhibits the result of the inevitable partizanship which arises when two independent authorities negotiate with and support rival chiefs. Study of Ibn Saud’s letter shows how an Arab chief attempts to set one English officer against another. In the case of Idris and the Sherif, the authorities of Egypt and Aden have become practically two parties, one backing one and one the other, and between the two there is little or no co-operation as the last line of the telegram shows. There can be only one of two remedies for this, and that is to put Aden under Egypt, or both under one authority. As much may be said in the case of Ibn Saud and the Sherif, though matters have not got so far advanced for geographical reasons, but the same forces are at work. The following is an attempt to analyse the root cause of the evil. No people have a greater natural aptitude for playing off persons and departments one against the other than Arabs. Political manipulation in town or desert is an inherent talent in all people of Arab stock. The Arabs can play English against French, Turk against German, Young Turk against Old, or Anglo-Indian against Anglo-Egyptian. The Arabs have charm, tact, and a deep insight into the relationships and weaknesses of men. It is instinctive in an Arab to seek a patron, and then work his patron against the patron of an enemy, our system of divided control is an incentive to this vicious tendency. Ibn Saud and Idris both realise quite plainly how the land lies, and make all they can out of the situation. The relations of London, Simla, Basra, and Cairo are perhaps clearer to these untutored desert folk than to British officers themselves. Consequently Ibn Saud rejoices in the Sherifs success, but tempers his satisfaction with the regret that probably the British in Egypt are not as wise as those of the Gulf. Idris adopts the attitude of sorrow rather than anger, and is in the running for a knighthood. Comfida falls and the authorities at Aden take no action as it has ceased to be in their sphere. So long as we continue to conduct our policy on the basis of divided control this state of affairs will go from bad to worse. A natural Arab tendency to divisions and feuds is increased by our own divisions, and our natural British tendency to team rivalry is increased by the artful tricks of the Arab notables. Both evils feed on each other. It is impossible to hope for a united Arabia until our Arabian policy is under one firm hand. Once Arabs know they are up against a single and undivided force they are extremely accom modating, but so long as there is a chance of setting people by the ears they will indulge in the exciting sport of promoting rivalry. In peace time this is a matter of little consequence, but in war concentration and unity of purpose are both vital. The Arab movement may or may not have much in it, but it is* bad policy to let a great potential asset fritter away merely because the Indian Government was established before the Suez Canal. Single control could beset up without moving any member of the personnel. M. S.SECRET For Reference only. ARABIAN REPORT. N.S. No. XIII. October 11, 1916 (night). Contents. PART 1.

Capture of Comfida by the Turks. It was mentioned in a postscript to the appreciation of the last report that the Turks had recaptured Comfida. Sir H. McMahon, telegraphing on the 4th October [No. 843], transmitted the report of Colonel Wilson, who said that the Turkish force was 1,800 strong with two guns; this, he thought, must be a part of the Ibha garrison which is believed to have been only about 3,000 strong. The Sherif said that he would send a force against them after the pilgrimage ; and he asked that meantime a ship might be sent to bombard them. ta-o ocoi- On the 8th October the Resident at Aden telegraphed to Simla [A.r. 258J m regard to the report of the capture of Comfida. He said that there were then m the Comfida district no large Sherif forces and none of Idrisi’s, and in the event of a naval demonstration at Comfida the Turks would evacuate it and reoccupy it again later. _ As for himself, as Comfida was supposed to be controlled by the bhenf, he regarded it as being outside his sphere. Bir Abbas Captured and Recaptured. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 10th October [No. 875] that Colonel Parker at Rabegh) had reported that, on the 6th October, the Turks took Bir Abbas and the listrict as far south as Jaff. It was reported that the Turkish force was composed of a •egiment of two battalions [? batteries] of artillery, the 130th and 42nd regiments, i mixed regiment, a regiment of mixed cavalry and [? infantry], and three aeroplanes- me of which was already broken and the other two not yet flown On the following day Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 878] that he had received i communication from H.M.S. “ Fox ” to the effect that Faisal had reported that the An-abs had, on the 6th October, retaken Bir Abbas, pursued the Turks, and taken arisoners, munitions, &amp;c. [898—12]2 Colonel Parker s Appreciation of the Situation. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 6th October [No. 852] a report on the situation which Colonel Parker, at Rabegh, had made to Colonel Wilson on the 3rd October. Colonel Parker said that, in brief, he appreciated the military situation as follows: If Mecca be denied to the Turkish force, the Arab cause will be successful; and, probably, the Turks will not be able to send more than one division south from Medina! According to all reports the Turkish force must pass by Rabegh ; therefore, if this place be held^ the Arab cause is won. The opposition to be offered to such a Turkish force before it reached Rabegh, though of the nature of a guerilla, would be con siderable ; if a Turkish division were successful in pressing through it would probably be able to take Rabegh from its present garrison. Two battalions of British troops entrenched at Rabegh would probably deter the Turks from making the advance ; and a British brigade landed two days before an attack should be sure of beating off the Turkish force. As to aeroplanes, though a valuable addition to a British, they would not be of material assistance to an Arab force. Moreover, the landing of a flight of aeroplanes commits us to co-operation in land operations of which, unless troops were laiided, we couM not ensure the success, and, without an advance, seaplanes are only slightly less efficient than aeroplanes. f orwarding this, Colonel Wilson asked whether there was any chance of the batteries asked for by the Arabs being sent. In his opinion they were most necessary. Sir H. McMahon added that, having regard to the conflicting views as to the need of them, he and the Commander-in-Chief were agreed that the despatch of the proposed flight should be held up for the present. On the 7th October Sir H. McMahon [No. 854] transmitted another telegram from Colonel Parkei of the same date. Faisal, with the greater part of his armv, was to have left Khshef or Beduna on the 6th October. To facilitate Faisal sending com munications, a ship was going to Bureika for the next few days. Faisal did not wish to fight a decisive action. Colonel Parker strongly recommended that Edallah should go to Rabegh if the Turkish advance should prove to be serious. Colonel Parker added that Ali Bey was asking when he might expect some quick-fiimg mountain guns ; one battery he said was promised long ago, and three more were asked for on the 22nd September. This matter is again referred to in another report of Colonel Parkers, telegraphed by Sir H. McMahon on the 10th October [No 875], in which it was mentioned that Ali was asking that the mountain batteries and barbed wire be expedited. The Prisoners of Taif. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 9th October [No. 866] that the Sherif was sending to Egypt the Turks captured at Taif, including Fesalil Pasha, Governor of Hejaz, the late Cadi of Mecca, the Director of Finance, the Director-General of Posts and telegraphs, and the Secretary-General of the Hejaz Government. These weie to arrive on the 10th October, together with the Governor’s civilian staff eighty-one women and children, seventy-seven officers, and 690 rank and file The remainder were to follow in batches. The Haj. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 9th October [No. 873] that Colonel Wilson had reported that the pilgrimage had been concluded by the safe return of the piWims from Arafat to Mecca. r s Supplies sent to the Sherif. Sir H. McMahon has forwarded [No. 230] the following list of munitions sent to the Sherif up to the 7th September : supplies and (A.) Money. 528,000Z. in gold.

En route from England. 5 colt machine-guns and 200,000 rounds. \ The Sherifs Subsidy. Sir H. McMahon has transmitted [No. 219] the translation of a letter, dated the 25th August, received by him from the Sherif relating to the latter’s subsidy of 125,000L a month, in the course of which the Sherif says : “Your Excellency knows that the above-mentioned monthly pay of 125,000L is for the organisation of Govern ment and its necessary administrations, and, will be deducted from the amount which we left to the justice of Great Britain to decide for our deficient Government, which is under Great Britain’s guardianship and protection dnring the occupation of Basra and Iraq.” Meeting of Colonel Wilson and the Sherifs son, Abdulla. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 7th October [No. 855J that the Sherif was about to send his son Abdulla to Jeddah to see Colonel Wilson, and that, in accordance with request, he was sending Mr. Storrs to the meeting, merely to act as a medium of communication. Colonel Wilson intimated the possibility of the Sherif himself coming. The object of the meeting was to convey to Sir H. McMahon the views of the Sherif either on Arab affairs in Syria or on the questions raised by the French mission, the nature of which was still unknown. Colonel Bray. On the 9th October Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No'. 872] that Colonel Wilson had made a special request that he might have the services of Colonel Bray, who accompanied the two Indian officers to Jeddah, for a month after these officers had returned to India. Sir H. McMahon hoped that this would be approved. The French Mission. Sir H. McMahon on the 9th October [No. 865] transmitted a telegram from Colonel Wilson, dated the 3rd October. Colonel Wilson said that Abdulla Bey had informed him by telephone that the French mission had brought a letter from the French Government for the Sherif intimating friendly feeling for the Arabs and their new Empire, and enquiring as to the safety of pilgrims, and the ideas and intentions of the Sherif. The mission was to leave after the end of the pilgrimage, and the Sherif wanted advice as to the form his reply should take : Abdulla was sending French and Ara^b copy of the letter from the French Government. The Sherif also wanted advice as to the presents he should make in return for those received. On the 7th October Arab Bureau telegraphed to Colonel Wilson that, as the contents of the letter were unknown, the High Commissioner could only advise Sherif to send a reply of a non-committal nature, guarded but friendly ; to which Colonel Wilson replied that, as he had not received the promised copy, he had suggested a reply of this nature. ? An Italian Consul at Jeddah. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 8th October [No. 860] that Colonel Brdmond had informed Colonel Wilson confidentially that he had heard that an Italian consul was coming to Jeddah. Colonel Bremond had informed the French Minister at Cairo that both .he and Colonel Wilson considered it most undesirable for any consuls to be allowed at Jeddah. Sir H. McMahon had already telegraphed on the 5th October [No. 848] that he should be reluctant to accept responsibility for the safety of any Italian, especially of one connected with Hodeidah ; and he added that, without the introduction of Italian elements, the difficulties of the Hejaz question were already sufficiently complex. Dutch Bilgrims in Mecca. On the 5th October Sir H. McMahon [No. 847 (B)] transmitted a telegram from Colonel Wilson saying that there were 2,050 Dutch pilgrims in Mecca, of whom 1,500 were fed by the Egyptian Wakf and 550 by the Sherif. Though all were destitute, Colonel Wilson w T as informed that, on their arrival at Singapore, 1,430 could pay theirpassage money. In regard to the refusal of the Dutch Government to help on the ^iouni i ^ that these pilgrims had stayed behind of their own freewill [see “Arabian import AI, N.S., p. IG], several of them state that they had no time to wind up their a rairs oefore the steamer provided by the Government sailed. It was desirable that s ^ 10u ~d be got out of the country, and Colonel Wilson asked whether the Netherlands Government could be approached again. AH Haidar s Proclamation. Sir H. McMahon has forwarded [No. 221] the following translation of the proclamation of Ah Haidar, appointed Sherif of Mecca by the Sultan of ' turkey. [See Arabian Report No. 1. N.S. p. 5] :— In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate. i his is our letter to the people of our country El Hejaz and those near them, whether townsmen or nomads, far or near. We thank God for having brought us up in the cradle of Islam, strengthened us all by Mohammed (prayers and peace be upon him), made us with you neighbours to the Holy House, and granted us all the privileges and rights of the neighbour—thanks that no words can express, and we prav to and salute our Lord and ancestor, the best of men who was chosen from the Arabs, and who combined his obedience to God with his obedience to the Imam according to His saying, “ Obey God and His Prophet and your masters,’' and his household and friends, who obeyed him to the last degree. Thirteen cmturies have passed since the beginning of Islam, during which it has gone through different stages of welfare and of adversity, has lost many of its territories and strength, but also at times regained and revived them. It has not left a single enemy country into which it has not entered, and there is not one Mohammedan country into which the enemies have not tried to enter, except our country the noble Hejaz. History does not record any invasion of Hejaz except by Moslem nations, it has remained immune from invasion in spite of the changes in times and destiny, it has been raised to a point that no enemy could reach. The enemy has invaded Egypt, the Sudan and India, Yemen, Ahkaf, Amman and vicinity, and this time he made an attempt on Basra, but did not dare to approach Mecca and the Hejaz, the blessed country of the Moslems and the Caliphs. The enemy continued his efforts until the general war broke out and the Ottoman Government rose to avenge Islam. The enemy then could not hope for anything in Hejaz as well as in any other country, nor could he aspire to set his foot near the noble Haramein. All of a sudden, however, the Sherif Hussein leagued himself with that enemy and is now trying to place the House of God, the Kibla of Islam, and the tomb of the Prophet under the protection of a Christian Government, war with the Turkish Government, and doing what it can to subjugate all Moslem nations. All the Sherif s allegat ions to justify himself in revolting against the Government and in setting Moslems fighting against each other do not beneiit him in the least before God, who knows the secret; neither before the Prophet, whose Law is that of the sun ; nor belore the people of Islam, who know what the English are and what they are doing. The Sherif Plussein cannot efface a single word of the truth, nor convince anybody of his competence to be an independent Emir, to fight against the Government and to assume charge of the affairs of Moslems, and to claim full ability to protect Islam. Therefore to be able to fight against a Great Power like the Ottoman Government^ he must necessarily shield himself under the wings of a foreign Government. This is hat he has actually done in agreement with England, who is deceiving him and picturing to him all sorts of false hopes to make him revolt against the Government whey is protect- ino - him, so that when England succeeds in this policy (may God forbid it !) his case with her will be the same as that of the Khedive of Egypt, the Sultan of Zanzibar, Emir of Lahj and the Emir of India, and the rest of the Islamic Governments who have fallen into the English trap. j-j 0 who sggs wh&amp;t hus befallen others should beware lest the same misfortune befall him also. The Sherif, before opening hostilities with a Power much superior to him, should have considered the fact that England would not help him unless she was afterwards to govern him, and that the moment she stretches her Unger to Hejaz, she will not relax her efforts until by degrees she annexes it to the other countries which she has already fraudulently occupied. Let him ask those Emirs who have done likewise before him, and let him read the treaties whicli England made with them and with others. lie will then understand how those Governments have changed from existence [898—12] C6 = to non-existence, and how they regret now what they have done. No matter how much the Sherif Hussein contradicts our belief that Hejaz will be a field for Christian troops, the fact is that the troops whom England will send him, whether Moslem or Christian,'are but servants of England, fighters in the army of a Christian Government, wearing her arms and obeying her orders, and thus there is really no difference in them, {'* whether they are Moslems or Christians, so long as the consequences that are going to fall upon Islam are the same. The head is the leader, and the other numbers follow. There is no one who denies that if those Moslem troops (according to the Sherif) conquer the Ottoman troops the result will be a victory for Christian England over Moslem Turkey. In other words the result will be (God forbid it ) that Christianity will have the upper hand over Islam, in the cradle of Islam and the house of Mohammed (prayers of God on him). Whether those Moslem troops are in the service of the Christians or of the Sherif Hussein himself who has joined them, they are officially under the command of England. God said “ He who governs them is from them.” His argument that because the Ottoman Government is allied with the Germans, who are Christians, he has the riuht then to be allied with England, does not hold water, for the reason that Turkey joined the Germans to fight with them against Christian government, and to ’use them for revenging Islam on its enemies taking the opportunity of their disunion to separate them more and more. She has succeeded, and has seen them torturing each other, thus punishing them for their oppressions of Islam. Further, the Germans, although Christians, have not occupied a yard of territory in Moslem hands, neither did they reduce to poverty and servitude 150 millions of Moslems like the English, who have enslaved the most respectable Moslem countries and their inhabitants, and who earnestly endeavour to destroy all political power in Islam, and to deprive it of all power of defence, so that the Moslems may be able to revolt against them. The first thing they will do, if they attain any success in Hejaz, will be to deprive the Arabs of their arms, first, by way of purchase, as they have done with the tribes of Irak, Oman, and South Yemen, which resulted in the revolution of Maskat ; and, second, by force, as they have done with the tribes in Egypt and Sudan, so that if they wanted to enter the country the Arabs shall be unable to resist them. Therefore there is no comparison with Germany and the alliance with England, although both belong to one religion ; and God says “ God does not forbid you from being friends with those who do not fight against your religion, and who do not chase you from your country; you should treat them with justice, fur God loves the just; but God forbids you from befriending those you fight your religion and chase you from your country by using some of you to help them do so.” The English have severed India, Egypt, the Sudan, Zanzibar, Somaliland, and a part of Arabia from the body of Islam and occupied them. They turned the strength of their inhabitants into weakness. They were not satisfied with that, but helped the French to occupy Morocco and Central Africa ; helped the Russians to occupy Persia, and the Italians to occupy Tripoli. They even came into agreement with their own enemies against the Moslems. There remains nothing they have not done in order to destroy Islamism. Hejaz only remained exempt from their aggression ; but now, unfortunately, it is no more so. They have found a means for their aims in the person of a man who should have been the first to defend Hejaz, putting at his disposal money and men, and because our family is responsible for the safety of the House. All men know how our ancestor, Ei Hussein Ibn Ali, relinquished the Caliphate in order to prevent Moslem bloodshed, and out of sympathy for the religion ; therefore, he in whose days the Christian Powers stretch their hand to Hejaz for the first time in history, is not one of us, and this great trespass should not be recorded in our history after our glorious stand in the past in support of the religion. For this reason and in conformity with the conduct of our ancestors when the Emir of the Faithful,” our lord Sultan Mohd. Fas had Y, has conferred upon me the Imarat of Mecca at a time when Hejaz is in real danger, I accepted it with the help of God not because I desire authority and power for this already pertains to us—but out of sympathy for the Holv Places lest they should fall into the hands of the enemy 7 , who if he once interferes in its affairs and is not opposed will shortly 7 enter it and tread on its sacred soil that has been sacred for over 1,300 years. If God and His Prophet command a thing we must obey and rise up to the Jihad. We must also explain to y 7 ou clearly how in joining the Christians the Sherif Flussein has placed the Holy Places under their mercy, that the weak among you may not be deceived by the falsehood that has affected the poor people of the desert, and in order that the ignorant, who have been taken in by these falsehoods, may not oblige us to unsheath our sword in their faces. We cab you all to obedience, it being the call of the Koran, the call of the Sultan,7 i 1 and the call of our forefathers whom the affairs of Hejaz concern. v We call you to be united and to rush to hg'ht the troops who are sent by the Christian English and those who dare to befnend them, and to support the troops of the Sultan who are advancing on Medina and Mecca to cleanse them from the infidels And he who disobeys the call of God and His Prophet, the anger of God will fall upon him.^ He who sees the foreigner begin to send his forces to the Holy Places and does not rise to defend them does not belong to the Prophet; and he who dares to help those foreigners who are the enemies of the religion, in any way, or agrees with anyone who revolts against the Government, he will render himself liable to torture in this world and in the other. I do not wish to believe that there is anyone among the people of these Holy Districts who will choose to obey Satan, and disobey the Sultan, or accept the infidel rather than the faithful, and I do not wish to see the people of those places give their necks to our swords whose deeds they have witnessed in our battles with the English and the French when thev attacked Chanak Kalaa and returned with failure. We have no doubt that God will protect those places where His House is, and which hold the bones of our Prophet, and will help you to succeed in this Holy War. Fight so that the word of God may be uppermost, and you may gain the riches of this world and the next, and bring shame and defeat upon those who dare to play with the House of God as well as upon the foreigners who keep them. Fight so that you may shortly enter the Holy Mosque in peace with your heads uplifted. Do not be deceived by the intriguers and the liars, and do not be afraid of their power, for God will make you conquer. May He include you in His Army and support you.

The C.P.O. at Basra telegraphed to Simla on the 6th October that he had received a further letter from Ibn Saud, dated the 3rd September. In regard to his attacking I bn Rashid m or near Hail, he alluded to the before-mentioned need of guns, but then went on to say that tire only obstacle at present was that the political juncture appeared to him to be unfavourable. If the question of attacking Ibn Rashid or assisting the Sherd were merely matters of policy concerning the chiefs themselves, then it was simply a matter of watching for a suitable opportunity; but if it was a question of our interests as well, then he would doubtless conform to our will after discussion with the C.P.O. ' Sir Percy Cox says that with the Army Commander’s permission he could arrange a meeting for the latter part of this nionth, but if it is not desired to press upon him any specific form of action [see “ Arabian Report, N.S. XII, p. 3], it would perhaps be better not to have the meeting just now. Sir Percy Cox asked for instructions on this point. _ , • p i Among other papers received this week from Basra is the translation of a long letter written by ibn Saud to the C.P.O. on the 20th July. The gist of what it contains has already appeared in the reports, but there is one passage which it seems advisable to quote. Speaking of the Sheri f he says : “ As soon as I was certain of the accuracy of the Sherif s news, and even before your letter readied me, I had the intention to write to your Honour regarding my position vis-d-vis the Sherif, and also regarding the questions which affect you m this connection. I feel it incumbent on me to state to you (though you are much better informed in regard to the affair than I ami that my fear is that the Sherif may obtain from the British Government an undertaking for his independent control over Hejaz and the Arabs. Although you yourself probably appreciate my hears it is possible that the representative of the British Government who is actually conducting the negotiations with the Sherif is not acquainted with the position. MASKAT. [Nil]SECRET. APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARABIAN REPORT No. XIV (New Series). THE political confusion arising out of a multiplicity of councils and counsellors and overlapping functionaries reaches a climax this week. There is no way of summarising what we are doing, because the telegrams are a perfect babel of conflicting suggestions and views, which interweave and intertwine from man to man and place to place in almost inextricable tangle. The best way of discerning the situation is to read the following list of dramatis 'personae who act in a piece in which it is impossible to observe the unities :— -Sir Archibald Murray, G.O.C., Egypt, must be consulted on any political move which has a bearing on the military situation. Sir Henry McMahon, High Commissioner in Egypt, the funnel through which all Arab political matter relating to Sherif and a good deal of military matter must pass. Admiral Wemyss, Commander-in-chief in the East Indies, responsible for all naval moves, consequently in direct touch with the lied Sea Arabs and in touch with the operations in the Gulf. Lieutenant-Commander Hogarth, head of the Arab Bureau, Cairo, collects information from all parts in regard to the Arab movement, and is responsible for co-ordination of policy between Cairo and Basra. General Clayton, D.M.I., Cairo, frequently advises Sir H. McMahon on Arab matters, is a sort of buffer between the G.O.C. and the Besidency. Sir Begin aid Wingate, Sirdar, normally lives isolated at Khartum, now in charge of the whole of the military and part of the political conduct of affairs in Hejaz. Corresponds with the Foreign Office through Sir Henry McMahon, but does not see him. Colonel Wilson, British representative at Jeddah, the only person in direct contact with the Sherif. Used to correspond through Sir H. McMahon, but it is presumed will now do so through the Sirdar at Khartum. Colonel Parker, British representative at Babegh, reports through Colonel Wilson. Colonel Bremond, French chief of the mission to the Sherif, will be responsible for about half the material and most of the Sherif s personnel when the French contingents arrive. Corresponds through M. de France with Paris. M. de France, French Minister in Cairo. G O.C. and Besident, Aden, controls our policy south of the sphere of the Sherif’s activities. When Idris holds Comfida it is in the Besident’s sphere, when the Sherif holds it or the Turks capture it from the Sherif it is out of his sphere. His empire consequently waxes and wanes with the foi tunes of Idris and not with the fortunes of the Arabs as a whole. He controls policy in Hadhramaut and Yemen. He is nominally under the Governor of Bombay, with whom he corresponds, but he is really under _ the Foreign Department, Simla. He sometimes corresponds with London direct. The Governor of Bombay, has some say in the affairs of Aden, but how much is difficult to define precisely.2 Sir Percy Zachariah Cox, C.P.O., Basra, subordinate to G.O.C. Force D in Mesopotamia, but paramount in the Gulf under Government of India. General Maude, G.O.C. Force D, supreme in Mesopotamia under C.I.G.S., London. Foreign Secretary at Simla. Responsible for Mesopotamia-Gulf policy, and has the right to deprecate any action which may be taken anywhere else as regards Arabian affairs. The Viceroy represents the Government of India, and is the channel between the Gulf and London for political affairs. The Secretary of State for India connects Government of India with War Committee as regards two-thirds of Arab affairs. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs connects Hejaz and Arab movement with War Committee, inasmuch as it affects Egypt or Entente Powers. Respon sible for conduct of policy in Hejaz. Mr in in nt :,'nrrn illliMuSy 7 That is to say, suggestions are liable to emanate from, or to be criticised by, mmakmm persons, two civil Departments, the Government of India, and the War Committee, without taking Paris and Rome into account. It may be safely said that, with the exception of the ancient constitution of Poland, it would be difficult to find a precedent for so complex or unworkable a political arrange ment as the British system which has evolved itself in Arabia since the war broke out in August 1914. Attention is drawn to this mess because instead of getting better it gets worse, more and more people get a right of deprecation, and suggestions are fired out from all quarters of the earth—Simla, London, Cairo, Paris, and Rome. The only service which has any power of knowing what it is about and is capable of coherent action, as far as Arabian affairs are concerned, being the Navy, since it alone is under one head responsible to one Department. Admiral Wemyss has only contributed two telegrams on other than routine in the last two weeks, the reason being that his position is clear, and there is no necessity for Ids referring and reporting except on matters of importance. For the rest there is an indescribable fog of suggestions advanced and withdrawn, conferences summoned and abandoned, proposals and counter-proposals, echoes and re-echoes, decisions and rumours. For instance, the Rabegh question has been thrashed out again and again since the 13th September, when the situation was threatening ; yet on the 14th October Sir H. McMahon is still in doubt as to whether the idea is wholly abandoned or no. Colonel Wilson gets information from the Sherif per telephone regarding French forces destined for Hejaz, based on a conversation between the Sherif and one of the French Arabs; instead of comparing the news with Lord Grey’s telegram of the 13th September stating precisely the composition of the French contingent or asking Colonel Bremond what is coming, he telegraphs to Sir Henry McMahon, who in turn telegraphs to London. AVith affairs in such a coil in Hejaz, what hope of efficient conduct of political affairs can there be in Arabia as a whole ? So far things have not gone wrong; the Sherif has done well enough, the pilgrimage is finished with for the year, the railway is cut for the time being, and there are good hopes of the Sherif s holding his own, if not of improving his position; but it is impossible not to see that if there is a failure we shall find it difficult to discover a decent excuse for ourselves. The Turks are almost certainly failing in men, we have a good force in Egypt and i ( ( I c E i ] ( \ tanother m Mesopotamia, the A_rab situation m Syria and. Hejaz is most promising', with policy and organisation the movement may well be developed into a force which will count strongly m frustrating the enemy s war aims ; weakening Turkey, diverting troops from Europe, curtailing the enemy’s corn area, stripping him of much of his treasured railway, bringing about the independence of Yemen, shunting the Caliphate, and fostering a political situation which in spring will give the Caucasus army excellent opportunities. These are all possibilities which can be worked for if there is some sort of order in our affairs, but so long as we are in our present state of chaos we must continue to pass from crisis to inertia, and from coma to panic, watching assets frittered away and opportuities missed. There is one way out of this difficulty, and it is once more suggested that, to set these affairs in order, a special department should be established in London, and two C.P.O.’s should act under it, one in the Gulf and one in the Red Sea, including Aden. That the C.P.O.’s should be subordinate to the G.O.C.’s in fields of operations, and elsewhere subordinate to the department in London. Such a simplification would at once co-ordinate the Arab movement, and put it in its proper relation to military operations as a whole, without disturbing a single official. A Turk once said, if I do my best and fail, it is the will of Allah ; but if I take no heed and fail, I shall have to answer at the Day of Judgment. M. S.SECRET. i For Eeference only. ARABIAN REPORT.

On the 3rd October the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon [No. 787] that the War Committee had had under its consideration the question of the military- control and supervision of all arrangements for assisting the Sherif in Hejaz, and that it had decided that this control and supervision should be entrusted to the Sirdar, who should be instructed to do what was necessary, keeping himself in close communication and co-operation with the commander of the naval forces in the Red Sea. The Commander-in-Chief in Egypt would be notified of this by the War Office, and he would be instructed to help (so far as his own requirements would permit) in the provision of stores and supplies. * Sir H. McMahon acknowledged the receipt of this telegram on the following day [No. 844] and said that he much regretted the decision arrived at for the reason that the arrangement which was proposed had already been given a full trial and had been found to be impracticable. The Sirdar undertook control, at Sir H. McMahon’s request, last June and after some weeks the arrangement had to be abandoned, as it led to overlapping, confusion, and endless correspondence without any compensating advantage. The centre of military intelligence, the Arab Bureau, and (in case of purchase of stores, &amp;c.) financial control were all in Egypt; the naval Commander-in-Chief was in close touch with Cairo and could not possibly he so with the Sirdar at Khartum. Moreover, the naval arrangements in the Red Sea must conform to the requirements of military operations in or from Egypt. Further, the entrance of French military elements on the scene made it desirable that Cairo and not Khartum should be the centre of military control. The military and political aspects of the question were so intermixed that facilities for rapid personal exchange of views between those responsible was necessary. Sir H. McMahon trusted that 'the decision arrived at might be reconsidered or at least held in abeyance till the Sirdar could express an opinion. On the 9th October Sir H. McMahon telegraphed again [No. 871] suggesting, as a solution of the control problem, the sending of a military mission to Jeddah, whose business should be to give well-reasoned and mature advice on the military problems of the situation as they arose. The idea of such a mission wasjfavoured by the Commander- in-Chief in Egypt. Sir H. McMahon suggested, as being suitable for the work, Colonel [898—13]l^ewcombe, R.E., D.S.O., who should be accompanied by an artillery, an infantry, and a medical adviser. On the same day and before the receipt of this telegram, the Foreign Office replied [No. 812] to Sir H. McMahon’s telegram of the 4th October, saying that the Commander-in-Chief in Egypt had expressed the opinion to the War Office that, if the military control were coupled with a large measure of political control, the Sirdar wa^ the best man for the control of the arrangements for helping the Sherif in Hejaz. Sir H. McMahon should arrange to give the Sirdar whatever political authority was necessary for the purpose. On the 11th of October Sir H. McMahon transmitted [No. 879] a telegram from the Sirdar, saying that he proposed, as soon as he could make the necessary arrange ments, to proceed to Jeddah or Kabegh, and that he should be glad if the Admiral in command of the E,ed Sea, one of Sir Archibald Murray’s senior staff officers, and, if Sir H. McMahon should think it desirable, representatives of the Arab Bureau and of the High Commissioner s offices, should meet him there. He also wished to meet Abdulla Bey with Colonels Wilson and Parker. After discussion in all its bearings of the political and military situation, he hoped to formulate definite proposals for the future. He wished this to be kept secret. YV hen the date and place of meeting were fixed, he should give out locally that he was proceeding to Port Sudan for a week or ten days. Sir H. McMahon replied on the 12th October | No. 885] that, in his opinion, the only way of reaching any arrangement workable under the new conditions was for the Sirdar, the naval Commander-in-Chief, and Sir H. McMahon himself to discuss matters. Sir H. McMahon added that it appeared essential that the Sirdar should visit Cairo before going to Jeddah, a course which incidentally would facilitate secrecy. Sir R. Wingate’s reply to this was telegraphed by Sir H. McMahon on the 13th October [No. 888]. He said that for various reasons it was [? inconvenient] for him to go to Cairo, and he did not think that any specially useful purpose would be served by his doing so. It would be impossible for him to be in Egypt and not see the Sultan. He was prepared to postpone his visit to Jeddah and to take over the political and military responsibility for Hejaz affairs as instructed in the Foreign Office telegram of the 9th October [No. 812], andi should like to have Sir H. McMcMahon’s views as to the degree of political control which the latter considered should be entrusted to him. His own idea was that “ it would be simpler if you gave me carte blanche” The Defence of Eabegh. On the 11th October Sir H. McMahon [No. 880] telegraphed a report which he had received from Colonel Parker at Rabegh through Colonel Wilson at Jeddah. Colonel Parker expressed the opinion that if the Turks attacked Rabegh under existing conditions, the attack would probably be successful, but a British or Soudanese brigade at Rabegh would be sufficient to save it, and prevent the Turkish advance on Mecca. Colonel Wilson commenting on this said that as artillery could not be sent now, there was a risk that a Turkish attack on Rabegh would be successful. The Sherif had asked that British troops should be held in readiness for despatch to Rabegh if this should be necessary ; and the principle that British troops should be sent in case of necessity^ had been approved. Both the Sherif arid Abdulla constantly asked whether a British force was ready to go to Rabegh if necessary. Colonel Parker expressed himself as against sending a flight of aeroplanes unless it were part of a British force ; but Colonel Wilson could not grasp why it should be useful with a British force and useless without one. The Sirdar, in his telegram to Sir H. McMahon op. the [?] 11th October, said that he was of opinion that aeroplanes and their escort of 200 men now on board ship at Suez should be sent to Rabegh as soon as possible. Pie adhered to this opinion after receipt of the above Parker-Wilson telegram. On the same day, the 11th October, the.Sirdar telegraphed to Sir PI. McMahon [No. 881], saying that in consequence of tiie views expressed by Colonels Parker and Wilson, he recommended that a British brigade should be forthwith placed under orders for Rabegh and arrangements made for its immediate conveyance thereto. Colonel Wilson should inform Abdulla of this, and if the latter asked for them, they should be sent without delay. On the 12th October Sir H. McMahon transmitted [No. 884] another telegram received from the Sirdar, in which the latter reiterated his opinion in regard to the despatch or aeroplanes and a brigade of British troops. On the following day Sir H. McMahon transmitted [No. 888] a further telegramfrom the Sirdar. In this he said that he inclined even more strongly to his expressed views on hearing of the despatch of French troops from Algiers [see below] ; it would surely, he said^ be advantageous for British troops to be installed at Ttabegh. He did not s are t le mew; that the landing of British troops at JRabegh would be resented by any ut a jew paid 1 urhish agents, whose opposition would disappear when they saw we imeant business. n 0ctober ^' ir McMahon transmitted [No. 889] a telegram from Colonel Wilson saying that he had received a telegram from the Sherif saying that the Arabs wished to advance on Medina, and that therefore he [the Sherif] requested that troops should be sent to Rabegh at once. Colonel YV ilson then had a long telephone conversation with the Sherif and Abdulla. They asked : 1. That Moslem troops should be sent to Rabegh at once by us. 2. That sufficient British troops should be ready to reach Rabegh four days after being asked for by the Sherif or Ali. 3. That if the expected French Moslem troops were sufficient for protecting Rabegh* they should be sent in preference to British troops. Colonel Wilson suggested that if troops mentioned were available they should be sent to hold Rabegh now : if not, that a British brigade should be held in readiness. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 13th October [No. 890] that the Sirdar had informed him that this telegram of Colonel Wilson’s had strengthened his previously- expressed opinions. . Finally, on the I4th October, Sir H. McMahon No. 886] telegraphed that he had communicated his views to the Sirdar :— 1. That it was vitally important not to land European troops in Hejaz until absolute necessity demanded it. It was for this reason, he said, that they had not already sent the sanctioned flight of aeroplanes. 2. Recent reports showing safe completion of pilgrimage, the check of the Turkish advance on Medina, and the damage of the Hejez railway all indicated a great diminution rather than an increase of necessity for immediate despatch of troops. 3. Notwithstanding the willingness of the Sherif and his sons to see European troops at Rabegh., the recent attitude of local Arabs towards the landing of British officers to examine the camping grounds of our force had not been cordial. Sir H. McMahon was therefore of opinion that the despatch even of aeroplanes and their escort was not advisable until some more pressing need arose. The aeroplanes and a brigade should be kept in readiness for embarkation. The immediate need was the provision of Q.-F. batteries; if the French Government could be made to supply these without any European, and with a minimum of Moslem personnel, developments could be awaited before taking further action. The Sherif s Operations. On the 11th October the Resident at Aden telegraphed [216 A.P.] that the “Minto” had reported that Comfida had been reoccupied on the 10th October by 120 of Nasir’s troops; that 400 Turks were 5 miles away; and that strong reinforce ments and provisions were urgently required. On the 12th October Sir IT. McMahon [No. 883] forwarded a report of Colonel Parker’s dated the 9th October (received through Colonel Wilson), to the effect that Faisal [in text Zysal] had retaken Bir Abbas and the Safr deffie after twelve hours’ fiohting, the Turks retiring on Bir-el-Rabba, near Bir-Masai. Faisal took some prisoners ; his loss was twenty killed. On the same date Sir H. McMahon also telegraphed [No. 882] that H.M.S. “ Dufferin ” had informed him that Shaykh Assaf had reported that he had destroyed the rail near Buweit for about 2 miles, and for a distance of forty-eight telegraph posts near Qhazail; also that he had blown up twenty-four of the standards of the Malal bridge and damaged the remaining eight. Assaf asked for more gelinite and red fuses. French Troops for the Sherif. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 13th October [No. 887] that Colonel Wilson had telegraphed on the previous day that Abdullah Bey had that morning informed [898—13] B 2him that the head of the French mission in Mecca had told him that he had received a telegram to the effect that a French Moslem force had sailed for Port Said from Algiers and that it consisted of eight mountain guns and sixteen machine guns, with some infantry and cavalry. The French mission asked where the Sherif would like this force landed, and the Sherif replied that, as it had started, it had better disembaik at Sue^ and await orders. Colonel Wilson, being asked by Abdullah, said that this was the only thing to do.; the alternative, he pointed out to Sir H. McMahon, was a blank refusal of assistance, and this he did not feel justified in suggesting, although the Sherif was not anxious to have French troops in Hejaz except in case of absolute necessity Colonel Wilson adds that he had not asked Colonel Bremond for confirmation of this news.

An agent connected witn the French service reports that he had an interview with Rechid Bey, ex-Minister for the Interior in the Kiamil Pasha Cabinet, in the course of which he made statements regarding the present situation in Turkey which may be summarised as follows : — Not only politically in order to avoid the complete dismemberment which threatens to be the punishment reserved for her persistence in the fatal path she has chosen, but also from an economic and humanitarian point of view it is to Turkeys interest to withdraw from the present war. By concluding a separate peace with the Entente^ Powers she could save herself from the frightful misery and ruin into which she is sinking deeper and deeper at the great risk of never being able to extricate herself, and. could shorten the war by at least several months.

I he sounding of certain elements in the present Government, which I am convinced, by private information, have already pronounced tendencies in the desired direction. “ 2. The exercise of pressure by circles remote from power, but with whom the Government will have to reckon. 3. Lastly, if these regular and pacific means fail, the organisation of a military rising by means of a revolutionary propaganda in the army itself. -^ ie first phase is already by way of being realised, I have taken it in hand myself, and in a fortnight’s time I shall receive sufficiently detailed information to enable me to make a definite statement on the subject. For I do not wish to state anything, and above all undertake anything which does not offer a real chance of success. However much I am against violent methods, the two last methods will have to be faced if they prove to be the only means of arriving at the desired result. In this case it would be necessary to get into touch with the elements to be roused in Turkey, and also with those who are ready to devote body and soul to the leading of a revolution, and who are at present in Malta and Egypt (?). It is an enterprise which can easily be carried out by means of small subsidies, and does not require any fabulous sums—a few hundred francs, a few thousand at the most. If I were not myself in a difficult position through my condemnation and the confiscation of my property, I would have paid the expenses myself. “ Three emissaries would suffice : at Salonica, at Malta, and in Egypt. In Roumelia we have a large number of men on whom we can count, ready to cross the frontier at our invitation, to offer their services to the Turkish army. They would be received with enthusiasm, and, being so few, they would almost certainly be divided up among the various corps. ^ Ihey would then be in a position to convey instructions to such of the officers as might be found to be in sympathy with the cause. In Egypt there are numbers of proved officers who are only awaiting the signal to act. ^ There are two at Malta—Colonel Savfet Bey and Nevres Bey—regarding whorn it would be useful to sound the English Government and ascertain if their transfer to Malta was carried out for some important reason or whether this was merely the result of an unimportant measure. “ Immediately I have the answer to the first question I will inform you, and will then ask you to take the steps necesary for the carrying out of any eventual action : small subsidies, facilities for communication, and correspondence through diplomatic or other channels. “ As a sincere friend of the Entente in general and France in particular, I am quite willing to devote myself to this work for the mutual good of my country and of the Allies.” German Views in regard to the Balkans. An agent reports that at a friendly meeting of several members of the German and Austrian legations of Berne, as well as the Bulgarian Charge d’Affaires, the Germans were heard to state, in connection with the question of the Balkan situation, that the result of the various campaigns in the Balkans was considered to be of vital importance to Germany, and that in order to prevent the complete overthrow of their6 Balkan allies, Germany would be prepared to send, if necessary, a very large number ol troops, and that the Balkans were considered by Germany so important, that they would be prepared to sacrifice a large amount of ground on the Western frontier and so shorten their line and enable them to send the necessary troops to the Balkans. APPENDIX. Committee of Union and Progress. The “ Frankfurter Zeitung ” publishes long extracts from the report submitted to Constantinojfi ^ ommittee Union and Progress, which is now meeting in The reference to the military situation includes the following: Thanks to tlm efforts and help of the German military mission we have succeeded m perfecting our military organisation. By restricting the system of payment for exemption from military service, and as a result of the extension of compulsory service for all, our armies, which according to the common belief could not number more than from 700,000 to 800,000 men, have been brought up to the figure of more than 3,000,000. The organisation and the reforms introduced m the schools for reserve officers and non-commissioned officers have enabled us o complete, and more than complete, our cadres of officers. Thanks to the zeal of ^ \ ctlve [this is evidently a characteristic compliment P f [j hy Enver to himself], the military education of our soldiers and the increase of their moral efficiency have reached such a pitch that they have been found worthy to defend themselves successfully against the greatest European armies and to take their place by the side of the best organised armies in order to defeat our enemies. The Armenian Atrocities. The report deals at length with the Armenian question. Most of the space is devoted to an account, on the usual lines, of the dangerous and revolutionary character urkey s Armenian subjects, the disorderly behaviour of Armenian “bands” and the almost benevolent methods of repression adopted bv the Turks.

' ■ rf LITTLE news of consequence comes from Hejaz, where Arab want of artillery and Turkish lack of transport seem to produce a temporary deadlock. The Rabegh situation remains unchanged, and is to that extent satisfactory. The arrival of the Haj at Mecca marks one important stage in the Arabian movement. In a reply to a question as to what effect the collapse of the Sherif might be expected to have on the Orient, the G.O.C. Egypt observes that though it might provoke a formidable upheaval, it might have “as little effect as the evacuation of Gallipoli or the surrender of Kut.” This suggests that in certain lights these two public humiliations have had little influence, on the other hand, it is submitted that both these events have had a repercussion far-reaching and profound. The Turks, in spite of disaffection and exhaustion, have an enhanced prestige, while ours has declined, consequently the moral value of very moderate enemy elements is increased, while our troops lose in containing power, owing to the growing disbelief in our offensive capacity. Two ideas general in the East are :— (i.) That a number of British Generals had to give up their swords to a young Turkish officer. (ii.) That the English are the only European soldiers, except the Greeks, on whom the Turks can inflict unavenged defeat. It is submitted that the number of men we have to employ against the Senussi, as compared with the number of men the Turks use to contain a possible rebellion in Syria, is a good example of what our mutual moral position is in the eyes of Orientals. The Viceroy’s telegram in regard to Ibn Saud is in consonance with the general policy of the Government of India in regard to the m ovement. What the “ immense benefits” are which accrue from the passive friendship of JNejd it is ditticult to see. Ibn Sand’s friendship implies the enmity of Ibn Reshid, the situation being one of Coddling and Short, with both gentry equally unwilling to fight each other or anyone else, except at a safe distance. The suggestion that if Ibn baud sent 1,0 0 i men at our request to Hejaz, he might at some future date make embarrassing claims on the Sherif, would appear to show a bias in favour of inaction. The rumour of offers of bribes to Swiss journalists to undertake pro-lurk anti- German propaganda coincides with the information conveyed to Mr Bourchier at Constanza regarding a Talaat-Enver split and a plot against the existing regime a C ° The purpose of both these schemes is obviously the splitting of the Anglo-Russian 1produce a variety of singular manoeuvres on the part both of Germans, Turks, and international financiers, in event of further allied military success. Notice should be taken of the cutting from the “ Morning Post.” No enemy could of malice devise anything more likely to encourage the enemy than the publication of such matter, impugning our Generals, showing want of discipline among officers, and. suggesting that Indian troops are unfairly used. It is strongly recommended that some steps should be taken to prevent the enemy receiving such useful moral support in future. M. S. P.S.-—Since going to press a telegram has been received from Sir H. McMahon announcing the recapture of Comfida by the Turks. This move is an operation under taken by the Turks from Assir, and probably indicates a desire of the Turkish commander in Assir to co-operate with the forces at Medina, which he naturally assumes is endeavouring to get to Mecca. What part Idris has played in the matter time will show ; unless the Turks achieve some success in the north the event will probably not have much importance.

THE War Council having asked what would be the effect on the Moslem world of a collapse of the Sherif’s revolt, Sir H. McMahon, on the 29th September, telegraphed [No. 824] the opinions of the Commander-in-Chief in Egypt and himself. The Commander-in-Chief said that he was not in a position to speak authorita tively. Such a collapse “ might have as little effect as the evacuation of Gallipoli or the surrender of Kut.” Rut, if there should be an upheaval, he anticipated that it would be of a formidable nature; and if experts think that such an upheaval is likely, then the forces in Egypt ought to be reinforced by three divisions at least. Sir H. McMahon expressed the opinion that the collapse of the Sherif would have a great effect throughout the whole Moslem world, varying, however, in importance in different countries. It would do away with the present effective barrier against Teuto- Turkish designs and would afford the enemy the base necessary for military and political activity on the lines of the Stotzingen mission in Yemen, the Red Sea littoral, Abyssinia, Somaliland, and the Sudan. It would endanger Idrisi and Ibn Saud, and so add to our difficulties in Aden and Mesopotamia. As each one of the political results mentioned would involve demands for additional troops elsewhere, the supply of which might primarily fall on Egypt, the Commander- in-Chief’s estimate of three divisions might prove to be too moderate. The Sirdar says that, for the Sudan alone, probably two additional brigades of British troops would be required, solely for defensive measures, on his frontier. Sir H. McMahon adds that fortunately the trend of recent events gives every reason for hoping that the present discussion is of a purely academic nature more especially so if a force is held ready in Egypt for the rapid effective defence of Rabegh if the necessity for such defence should arise. On that point he was sending a separate communication. The result of failure was also dealt with in a report made to the Sirdar by one of his secretaries, Ibrahim Bey Dimitri, a Syrian, who accompanied Colonel Wilson to [898—11] BJeddah at the end of July. Ibrahim Bey is an ardent supporter of the Arab cause and, in spite of his being a Christian, has been elected a member of the Arab Party. In this report, Ibrahim Bey said that he had a discussion with a number of natives respectable people, in the house of the Sherif’s agent at Jeddah. The general opinio^’ was that if the Sherif should fail in his attempt his failure would, beyond doubt be^ severe blow to the moral position of Great Britain and to its influence over the Arab Chiefs and Emirs in Arabia and Mesopotamia, as well as in India, Egypt, and elsewhere. In fact it would annoy the whole Mohammedan world, which, although it looks at present on this movement with displeasure and uneasiness, on account of the fears that are entertained about the integrity of Islam, yet would be prepared to respect the Arabian Government if it succeeded in replacing Turkey ; and these feelings would be intensified if the new Arabian Government were seen to be on the way to prosperitv and success, and that no loss had been caused to Islam by its establishment. The Sherif s Operations. On the 29th September the D.M.I. telegraphed to Colonel Marsh a revised estimate of the Turkish forces in the Medina area, showing a total in all of 8,900 infantry, 1,000 camelry, and 36 guns, sixteen of the latter being old-pattern field guns. Fakhri Pasha was in command. The Haj. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 3rd October [No. 842 (R)] that Colonel Wilson had reported the safe arrival at Mecca of the Holy Carpet and the Egyptian pilgrimage. r The Arab Prisoners. The explanation of the defection of the Arab prisoners who, having been sent from gypt and Jeddah for that purpose, refused to join the Sherif’s forces, is given in the above-mentioned report of Ibrahim Bey Dimitri. He says that he found the Turkish prisoners were permitted to move about freely, no effort being made to put them under control. They spread “all sorts of false reports and poisonous ideas” about the town. ^ t art “ ler b men wil ° come from Egypt fell a prey to pro-Turkish intriguers at Jeddah, and two days after their arrival they refused to go to Mecca on the plea that they could not fight against their Caliph and their co-religionists IF O 187454.] &amp; l • Opinion in Afghanistan. , Kabul.-ln his diary for the week ending the 23rd August last fl.O.P., 3988] the British agent at Kabal records that a special Darbar had been held by the Amir, at which all the ‘ elders and men of light and learning,” the remnants of the German mission and the members of the Shvra were present. The object of the meeting was to consider the Sherif s action. The speaker who opened the discussion said that the ewA qu been . 1 received consternation all over the Moslem world; that the Sherif had been guilty of obvious disloyalty, perfidy, and treachery against ns mg o s am and his Caliph, and that owing to his misdeeds the Sherif deserved the universal abhorrence and curse of the Moslem world.

He had already urged him to arrest Ibn Faraon[See “ Arabian Report,” XI, N.S., p. 14], but he felt certain that he would not do it. If exhortations were confined to general terms he would probably do no more than continue to worry Ibn Rashid in a desultory way and at a respectful distance from ^lail. The O.P.O. was of opinion that Ibn Sand would be unwilling, and unable, to 'Attack Hail without assistance in money and guns, with men to man them. The C.P.O. enquired whether, if he were willing to do this, with such assistance, it would be worth while to give it. Short of that Ibn Sand might be definitely pressed to arm and equip a contingent of his own tribesmen on camels to join the Sherif. In regard to this, the Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office on the 30th September [P. 4050] that the Indian Government deprecated any attempt being made to press Ibn Saud to take specific action, to help either the Sherif or us. Should he do so spontaneously, well and good ; if not, we should be satisfied with the immense asset; we have secured in the passive friendship of Nejd. The Indian Government was certainly unable to spare guns, and the despatch of 1,000 Nejd tribesmen would be of little material value to Sherif, would weaken Ibn Saud vis-d-vis Ibn Rashid and, perhaps, would lead subsequently to embarrassing claims by Ibn Saud against the Sherif. KOWEYT AND THE TRUCIAL COAST. Some notes from the diary of the A.P.O. at Koweyt, for part of the month of • August, have been sent from Basra. It is recorded that on the 17th August the Shaykh left Koweyt to inspect his date gardens, and expressed the intention of calling on the C.P.O. at Basra before his return. Also that, two days later, some men arrived from Nejd and retailed gossip about the Sherif and his revolt which they had picked up there ; among other items was a story of our having landed men at Jeddah and Rabegh. The A.P.O. did not mention how he had-dealt with this. BAHREIN. [Nil.] MASKAT. [Nil.] PART II POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. Situation unchanged. The Caucasus. [Nil] PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. Turkish Propaganda. An agent reports that a certain Nafilian who is in close touch with, and has been worW for the Ottoman Legation in Berne, has recently approached two Swiss news- ZersL Lusanne viz., th e S “ Gazette of Lausanne” and the “Tnbuna of Lausanne,” ^ •?! rvffhr of a larffe sum of money if they would commence a strong propaganda m fovouTof Turk y He fsTaid to ha/e statel that a sum of 20 000L had been received in Berne from Turkey for this purpose, and that the bulk of this sum had come from4 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Constantinople. Both papers refused the offer. It is also stated that the offer was for a campaign in favour of Turkey and ao-ainst Germany ; but this needs confirmation. The same agent reports that an emissary from Naby Bey (ex-Minister at Home who came to Switzerland recently), has approached an English agent asking hini^ whether the British authorities would be willing to receive a communication from Talaat Bey. Report on the Sheri fs Revolt made by a highly-placed Diplomat in Constantinople in a Letter to his Government dated July 7. The Turks greatly feared a revolt in Arabia and the opening of an Arabic question. And all those who closely followed the course of Turkish affairs foresaw it. But owing to the present state of affairs and to the declaration of the Holy War. it was not considered likely that Arabia would rise so soon; certainly before the end of the European war. Therefore the events in Hejaz have frightened not only the Turkish Government but also Turkey’s allies, and specially Germany. According to information received here, the Emir of Mecca, Hussein Pasha, having declared himself Great Kalif of all the Mohammedans (a title which was hitherto borne by the Sultan), attacked, at the head of many Arabs, the Turkish garrison of Jeddah, which surrendered. Then he marched towards the city of Tayif, whose garrison also surrendered. The Arabs, spurred by these initial successes, attacked the Turkish troops in Medina but were repelled, at least according to the assertions of Turkish official circles. On receiving the news the Sultan by an irade deposed the Emir of the Mecca, and named as his successor the Vice-President of the Senate, Ali Haidar Pasha, who has left last week for Damascus. The commander of the 4th Syrian Army, Jemal Pasha, has received orders to suppress the Arab revolt and to establish the new Emir in Mecca. To carry out these orders two Turkish divisions were sent from Syria, and began their concentration in Medina. Experts in Arabian affairs seem most pessimistic, and consider the extraordinary military measures to suppress the movement as inadequate. The revolt of Arabia will, they believe, reach great proportions if England, as is most likely, supports the insurgents by sending munitions and guns to Jeddah and if the ambitious imam, Yahya, all powerful in the Yemen, and the dervish Idris, all powerful in Assyria, join the Emir of Mecca. Arabia s insurrection was undoubtedly fomented by the British ; but what greatly contributed to hasten its outbreak was, on one hand the be ginning by the Turkish Army of the Arabian town of Kerlela, sacred in Mesopotamia and on the Euphrates ; and on the other hand, the persecutions exercised by the Turkish authorities upon the Arabs of byria. The Turkish authorities at Bey rut and Damascus, having reason to suppose that the majority of the influential Syrians had made a private agreement with the French, seized the activities of the French consulate, and unfortunately found many official clbcuments incriminating Syrians. The most incriminating, upon which the charge was founded, were the reports of the French Consul at Cairo, Mr. de France, who described the proceedings and resolutions of the Congress of Syrians at Cairo in 1913, which had voted for achieving by all means the independence of Syria, selecting as sovereign the councillor Shefik-bin-Ahmed el Mulayed, who belongs to the great and powerful family of the El Azam. Another most incriminating document was a report from the French Minister at Constantinople, M. Bompard, dealing with a long interview between himself and Shefik el Mulayed, in which formal promise of France’s support was asked in case of an uprising in favour of Syria’s independence. The remainder of the correspondence showed that the official agents of France in Tmkey strove to establish French influence over Syria, and had come to an under standing with many influential Syrians. After these discoveries Jemal Pasha, fully empowered by the Turkish Government to act according to his own judgment, displayed great severity. He sent before the courts martial (incompetent to judge political offences anterior to the outbreak of the war) all the notable Syrians incriminated by the documents, insisting, in order to dominate by terror the Arabian people, that the best known and most influential should be condemned to death and hanged. The. effect w T as^ widely different from what he expected. So far as I know, the indignation of the Syrians is such that they would have revolted forthwith, followingthe Emir of Mecca’s example, had not the whole of Syria been occupied by the fourth army, preparing for the Egypt expedition. Such is in brief the situation in Arabia and Syria. It pre-occupies Turkey and Germany extremely. An Arabian question is created; and if the Hejaz movement is ^ot promptly stopped, it will surely extend to Mesopotamia, which will render the position of Turkey still more critical. Plot against Enver Pasha. The following confidential report was communicated by Mr. Bourchier to Sir George Barclay, British Minister at Bucharest:— Among those who are secretly working for the overthrow of Enver Pasha may be reckoned almost all the members of the Imperial Family, including Prince Vahid-ed- Din, the Heir-Apparent. The list:also includes the Grand Vizier (Prince Halim Said) Djemal Pasha, commanding the army in Syria; Hadji Add Bey, Governor of Adrianople ; Djavid Bey, former Minister of Finance ; the greater portion of the Moslem deputies, and a number of notables and functionaries. Even Talaat Bey, the Minister of the Interior, who is personally jealous of Enver, is now said to be associated with this group, which is in common with the Ittilet, or Old Turk party, sympathisers with the cause of the Entente. The Old Turk leaders had recently come to the decision to attempt a coup d’Etat; but in view of the small chances of success against the German troops, they have abandoned this plan for the present. Some of them are now endeavouring to cajole Enver, and to persuade him to dismiss his alter ego, Ismail Hakki, chef des expeditions (Sevkiat reissi oumoumisi), accusing him of malversation and negligence, which, they allege, have been the cause of the recent reverse in the Caucasus. After getting rid of Hakki, the Ententists hope to instal Djemal Pasha in the place of Enver as Minister of War, and then to initiate negotiations for peace. The Ulema, who are extremely hostile to Enver, are said to meditate a coup in favour of the Grand Sherif of Mecca. The Shaykh-ul-Islam is also said to favour him. A renewal of British activity in the Mesopotamia region would, if possible, be desirable in order to encourage the tendency of the neighbouring Arab chiefs to support the Sherif; the Shaykh of Koweit is especially his friend. It is difficult to see how the present order of things at Constantinople can be changed except by a military revolt. Till recently the city has been almost completely denuded of Turkish troops, but latterly two regiments have arrived from Tchorlou.APPENDIX. Miscellaneous Cuttings from the Press. Enemy Propaganda in England. Views of Settlement. (To the Editor of the “ Nation.”) Sir, PERMIT me to resume the theme of my last week’s letter, and to come to the more difficult questions involved in the settlement of the terms of peace after the present war. If I take as my basis the supposition that we and our Allies win a complete victory, this is not because I assume such an issue as certain; but it is at any rate a possibility; and it is only on this assumption that we can determine for ourselves what our real purposes are; what we shall do, if nothing impedes our doing it. Imperfect success may bring results of real value ; but we shall only know our own mind if we assume our success to be complete. In the event supposed, Germany will (it can hardly be doubted) lose Alsace and Lorraine ; Germany and Austria will lose those parts of Poland which have hitherto been subject to them ; the foreign territory invaded by our enemies will revert^ to its original status ; Russia will win Armenia, also Constantinople and the land adjoining that city up to Adrianople, and also the suzerainty over Poland. It can hardly be doubted that Italy will win the Italian Tyrol and Trieste ; and it will seem natural that Bosnia and Herzegovina shall cease to be Austrian and become part of a greater Serbia, as also that to this greater Serbia the seaport of Cat taro shall be attached. In con sideration of this extension of Serbia, it is probable that Bulgaria might be allowed to resume that borderland which, though now under Serbia, has a Bulgarian population. What of ourselves ? We could not, without giving deep offence to our own colonies, contemplate the retrocession to Germany of South-West Africa, or of that part of New Guinea which before the war was under Germany, or of the adjacent islands, or of Samoa. The results which I have just been enumerating are almost inevitable, if the victory of ourselves and of our Allies be complete. But they are results which cannot be accepted by Germany, Austria, and Turkey without humdiation; and now comes the question how far we wish that humiliation to be pressed. To be humiliated, is an experience which has belonged some time or other to every nation of Europe ; and there has, generally, been something salutary in the effects of it; but if we wish the countries of the world to be united in a permanently peaceable bond, we must not allow that humiliation to be an enduring memory. Bearing this in our mind, let us consider each of our foes in turn. The Turks are, in some simple ways, an excellent people; honest, brave, and of great dignity ; but they cannot conceive of government except by military methods; that a government should accept the will of its subjects is an idea foreign to their character. As a governing race they are a danger to the world ; they ought to be treated, like all Mahommedans, wixh consideration and respect; but they ought not to govern; and now is the time for their government practically to cease. The Germans, during the last half-century, have allowed the military aspect of government to grow upon them in a lamentable degree, and herein has lain the cause of the present war ; but the spirit of warfare, though present in them, is not deeply engraved. In so far as it has been the result of pride and ambition, it is to be hoped that the issue of the present war will correct it in them. But fear has also been a potent influence m producing it; if they no longer fear their neighbours, they will cease to be warlike. The same is true of Austria ; and the peaceable achievements of both Germany and Austria have been so numerous and so striking that we may trust, if they are not too deeply wounded in their self-esteem now, they will fall into the general line of European progress without resentment against other countries. Whether the Hohenzollerns should be permitted any longer to rule in Germany is a question to which perhaps I need not give a determinate answer. But the main key to the solution of the situation lies, I think, in the committal of the greater part of Asiatic Turkey to the supervision of Germany and Austria. Not, however, Syria ; that ought to be under the super intendence of France, as Egypt is under that of Great Britain. But if Germany and Austria have the task of restoring Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to their ancient prosperity, they will have their hands full of peaceable occupations, and such asmagnificent. &lt;« Morn i n g p 0 st,” 29th September.] eminently need effective supervision. To enable them to administer such supervision^ one or more harbours on the Mediterranean coast ought to be reserved to them. The fortifications on the Dardanelles and on the Bosphorus ought to be destroyed, gnd never to be rebuilt. Then, I confess, I think that the dependencies of Germany in Africa, with the exception of German South-West Africa, ought to be restored to her as they were before the war. The Germans may not be the best governors of colonies, but they are surely as good as the Belgians, and they will improve, as all Christian nations improve, with time. Lastly, there is one measure which, if it were adopted immediately after the war, would serve the cause of peace unspeakably. Let representatives of all nations meet at The Hague, and obtain information as to what great engineering works in the interests of peaceful progress are needed in the world; let these works be assigned to those firms which hitherto have been the chief constructors of guns and other implements of war ; and let it be forbidden henceforth to any private person or private company to construct weapons of war. In this way a great inducement to war, influencing the minds of powerful private persons, will be removed. I have tried to suggest a way of peace, which shall consist in diverting the minds of men to their true interests rather than to false ones ; and this, surely, is the Christian method. Yours, &amp;c.

The following is an extract from a letter written by an officer of the Indian army, recently with the Mesopotamia forces. It is dated some months ago : “In Mesopotamia they are handicapped by the appalling bungling and mis- manao-ement of the entire organisation of I.E.F.'D,’ and the appalling economy of the Indian Government. Also, they have some of the most awful bunglers in charge of the field ambulances at the front that you ever saw. ‘ Kutcha ’ B.A.M.C. fools, who don’t know a mosquito when it bites them, trying to treat tropical diseases.

APPRECIATION OF THE ANNEXED ARABIAN REPORT No. XI {New Series). THIS week’s report is more than usually bulky owing to several large papers having come in simultaneously from various quarters. However, there are certain items which require careful attention. The whole of the reports of the narratives of the two Arab officers should be read, as they give a very good general view of Turkey since the beginning of hostilities and a useful survey of the Arabic-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The special points which may be gathered from the reports of these officers are : (i) the usefulness of aeroplane pamphlet propaganda, which both officers urge should be used freely in Syria, having given excellent results in the past; (ii) the great prestige which the British Navy enjoys on the Mediterranean littoral, a prestige which has not suffered in the same way as that of our land forces; (iii) the feebleness of the Hejaz railway and its liability to interruption from purely natural causes; (iv) the situation in Syria and Palestine, which will be referred to in a later passage; and (v) the corroboration of the reported horrors perpetrated on the Armenians. With regard to the Armenian evidence it is suggested that the matter should be made public in such a form as will not expose the source of information. With regard to the rest of the report, the outstanding question is that of the military position at Rabegh. Admiral Wemyss’ latest report is distinctly reassuring, and, combined with the fall of Taif and the consequent addition to the Sherif’s forces, and the evident difficulties which the Turkish commander has to combat in coping with transport problems, gives grounds for good hope of the Sherif’s being able to hold his own; however, it must be remembered that the Sherif s men are still only raw levies of irregulars, deficient in artillery and organisation. The proposal to land British or European-led troops at Rabegh (it is submitted, j as a personal opinion) is one fraught with grave danger both to the Sherif and to ourselves, and should only be used as a last resort. The Arabs are fiercely independent, and the appearance of European-led troops in large formed bodies in what is undoubtedly Hejaz territory might provoke violent confusion and dissension amongst them. The Sherif may have made the request for such assistance in a moment of panic, but should the request be made again it would be well to remember that such an act could only be justified by the certainty of its necessity and the equal certainty of its success. In event of a 'collapse of the Sherif’s power it would be wiser to offer him safety at Jeddah than to embark on a risky campaign in forbidden lands; however, for the moment there does not appear to be any ground for serious apprehension. Presuming that military arrangements are being macie for action from Egypt, the most efficacious assistance we can give the Sherif is^ to make this action as con centrated and successful as possible; on the same hypothesis the best political assistance that can be given to such military action is to work up the elements of rebellion in Syria, Palestine, and the Syrian Desert, which will have the double effect of impeding Turkish operations in Hejaz and Southern Palestine by causing confusion in the area where the Turkish central military control is stationed. It is suggested that from some point in tne Gulf of Akaba it should be possible to [898—9] &lt;3tel establish touch with the Anazeh, Sakhr, and Kerak Arabs, and through them with the Druses and bands of deserters. To supply these people with arms, money, and munitions, and get into better communication with them should not require anything in the shape of an independent military operation, and provided a successful issue attended the presumed military action from Egypt, a very favourable turn might be given to events in the whole of Syria and Palestine, besides putting the Sherif out of all danger. The state of affairs in Syria and Palestine described in the two officers’ reports, which have every evidence of being conservative and moderate statements, show that we have the possibility of a rising of at least 65,000 men securely based on natural strongholds and supported by large numbers of Bedawin, who are not counted in the above figure. Should the presumed military action and the hypothetical rising offer the Turks a combination sufficiently formidable to oblige them to anticipate the contingency of invasion and rebellion by the despatch of divisions from the Caucasus, there would be at least the advantage of having drawn troops from more important fields. 1 Having dealt with the major issue, there are certain points of minor importance which require consideration. Taken in geographical order, there is first the question of Idris ; it is unfortunate that here we have the natural results of dealing with one problem from two centres of control. Idris is the client of Aden, and writes to the Governor of Aden, without apparent rebuke, complaining of the action of British officers, while doubtless sooner or later the Sherif will do the same in Egypt when similar j circumstances arise. Both men will naturally fall into these lines of conduct so long as they are not dealt with by one person ; probably the Sherif is out for position and Idris for money. It is quite beside the point to feel resentful at Arab divisions when our own arrangements tend to promote them. It is suggested that Idris should be made to withdraw his criticisms of our officers, and should not be made a knight until he has won his spurs by catching or killing some Turks. It might also be pointed out to him that no matted how he may dislike the Sherif, he (Idris) will be heard of no more if the Sherif falls, as the fall of the Sherif must mean the end of Arab inde pendence in gross and in detail. Idris’s past record does not go to show that a little plain speaking will upset him; he is a professional conjuror, viz., a worker of miracles, and a very smart man about money ; has had his ups and downs, and knows when to bluster and when to be discreet. dhe^ fall of half suggests that, when the news reaches the Imam of Sanaa, he will possibly reconsider his position in regard to the Turks. If any opportunity offers of inducing the Imam to declare his independence and to expel the Turks, it would be very advantageous in view of the persistent claims of Italy to interests in Yemen. No minor considerations of post-war readjustments of our Aden frontier, or the annexation of Taiz, should stand in the way of such an advantage. The reports from Maskat, Bahrein and Koweyt are somewhat chilly : it is not very flattering to British amour-propre to learn that at Maskat the story of the Sherif s rising is not credited, and does not speak very well for our methods of propaganda. Of course, allowance must be made for the fact that the C.P.O., Basra, had assumed that the idea of a confederation of Arab States was defunct; it naturally follows that there could not be much enthusiasm in pushing what was supposed to be an abandoned idea.The coldness shown by the Government of India towards the Arab movement since j its inception will always prove a deadening influence in the Persian Gulf, and must ? naturally act as a damper on the keenness of our political officers there. An excellent j example of this anti-pathetic attitude is displayed in the Straits Settlements papers ; General Hideout, Officer Commanding Forces, Singapore, by tact and guidance fostered the popularity of the Sherif and his cause as against the Teuto-Turkish propa ganda of our enemies; he gave a favourable account of the situation as regards Moslem feeling in the Far East in a telegram of the 7th August. On this being communicated ] to the Indian Government the latter, on the 25th August, requested that no portion of ; this information should be made public. Why favourable news should be suppressed at I this late date, when it is patent to the world that the Allies are supporting the Sherif, I it is difficult to understand. Lastly, attention is drawn to the peculiar significance of the small cutting from the “ Bystander ” f this paper has consistently, under a cloak of apparent levity, * devoted its time to uttering similar sentiments since the beginning of the war. It has hinted at collusion between the Emperor of Bussia and the German Emperor, suggested that the French were feeling for peace, and been actually fined for insulting the British Army. The construction and substance of the small paragraph show a knowledge and purpose neither to be despised nor overlooked. The rest of the paper is devoted to actresses’ photographs and comic pictures. M. S.SECRET ARABIAN REPORT. N.S. No. XL September 27, 1916 {night). Contents. PART I. Arab Movement—General Situation.

Junior-Captain Shukri Shurbaji’s Account of his Adventures from February 1915 to September of the same year. On the outbreak or the war I was at the Mditary College in Damascus, and was called up as a cadet. In February 1915 I was made 2nd Lieutenant, and afterwards promoted to Lieutenant. I remained about a year in Damascus as Instructor first, and then was made A.D.C. to Place Commandant and Military Police Officer. On the opening of hostilities the Turkish authorities ordered that great demonstrations should be held. I he majority of the population, however, did not want war, it was still feeling the disastrous effect from the Tripoli and Balkan wars. The authorities tried to raise the spirits of the people by the promise of swift victories and the conquest of Egypt. Besides they spread news of great German victories over the Allies. Apart from some ignorant people and those who were under the influence of the Unionists, the population was not deceived oy bombastic promises. The Arab Committee, to which 1 belong, increased its activities, foreseeing the downfall of Turkey, and the emancipation of the Arabs from Imkish misiule, with the assistance of England and franco. While at Damascus 1 was sent to Iben in the Sinai Desert, to accompany 500 soldiers recruited to do railway and load woik. One halt oi this company deserted on the road to Iben, and I was informed afterwards that the other half deserted after the failure of the expedition to the Canal. Iiom Iben I returned to Damascus. At that tune Jemal Pasiia showed great con- si dei a Mon foi the Arabs, anti never betrayed his antagonism. He sought the friendship of Arab notables, and extended hospitality to them. Jemal’s outward benevolence towards tne Arabs lasted uncil the failure of the Dardanelles Expedition, then he unmasked, and began his rule of terror with wholesale hangings and deportations. About tne middle of June 1.915 I received the order to go to Constantinople with mneteen other young Arab officers, all like myself belonging to the Arab Committee. Ihe l aikish authorities^ began to get alarmed at the spreading of the Arab movement, md to undermine it by dispersing the Arab officers. Being in no hurry to arrive at Constantinople we travelled leisurely, and spent about a month on the way. We vveiw by train from Damascus to Aleppo and Rajun. From Rajun to Osmanieh by carriage, train to Tarsus, carriage to Bozanti, and train to Haidar Pasha. At thattime typhus tuis i aging everywhere in Syria, especnally in Aleppo. On my way to ons an mo pe I saw thousands of Armenians being deported south. They were in a pin u condition, and subjected to cruel treatment by the gendarmes and soldiers accompanying them. Several thousands were killed and others died from exhaustion, ^tarva ion 01 disease. ^ The highways were strewn with their bodies. A week after y arriva ng onstantmople I was attached to the Place Commandant as a military lc ^ l ° 1 ^ a ^d' a lion.^ On the 15th August the battalion was ordered to join e egiment, J5th Division at Saros. We proceeded by train in twenty'- our loins to Ozun-Kubri, and irom there we marched in four days to Saros. After a montns stay at Saros, our battalion was annexed to the 1st Regiment, 2nd Division, and ordered to proceed to Mesopotamia Second Lieutenant Ahmed Youssef Shaykha’s Adventures between October 1914 and September 1915. At the time Turkey entered the war I was at Damascus, a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, 74th Regiment, 25th Division, all Arabs. The populace of Damascus made great manifestations, organised by the authorities, who spread the news ol great German victories, and announced that Egypt would be conquered soon. The better cla^s people did not join in the demonstrations. The condition of Damascus was normal at the time, and food supplies were plentiful. The Druses of Hauran and Lebanon kept aioof and refused to give men for the army. A fortnight after the outbreak of hostilities I was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant, and ordered to Dera’a, where I was incorporated in the 75th Regiment of the same division. I remained at Dera’a till the 26th October, when my regiment received orders to proceed to Pales ine in order to join the expedition against Egypt. The soldiers were cheered up by the assurance that there would be hardly any fighting in Egypt, and that as soon as they reached the Suez Canal the Egyptians would rise against the English, and welcome the Turkish Army with open arms. The troops would be treated royally in Egypt, and live on the fat of the land. At that time the troops were well fed, well clothed, and paid regularly, even two or three months in advance. There seemed to be plenty of gold and silver coins then. We left Dera’a on the 26th October, 1914, and went by train in twelve hours to Zile. We stayed six days at Zile. From the latter place we marched in six hours to Nablus. We spent one day at Nablus, the officers being quartered at the Zawias (meeting places of Moslem clergy)and the soldiers in mosques. We marched in one day from Nablus to Lubban, another day from Lubban to Eire, and a third day from Eire to Bethlehem, going through Jerusalem, where the regiment was welcomed by the population and offered cigarettes and refreshments. At Bethlehem we were quartered at the French Convent of the Sisters of Charity. We remained a fortnight at Bethlehem* then we moved on and marched in one day to Hebron. ’There we were allotted quarters for the night in the Russian building. We marched the following day to Dahie. Another day’s march brought us to Bir-es-Saba, where we arrived on the 11th December, 1914. My regiment stayed three days at Bir-es-Saba and then proceeded to the Canal. I was left behind and assigned the duty of telegraph operator. At Bir-es Saba there were several German officers with the Genera] Staff, also several German engineers, gunners, mine-laying experts, and trench designers. The total number of the Expeditionary Force from Bir-es-Saba was about 13.000 troops, about 3,000 of them being camp followers and Army Service Corps. They had 15,000 camels for the transport of munitions, food supplies, Ac. Only about one-half of the troops returned to Bir-es-Saba. The losses in killed, wounded, prisoners, and missing were very Davy. A large number of troops died from thirst. Over two-thirds of the camels died. I heard officers aod soldiers say that if the English had pursued the Turks, not one man would have escaped. After the return of the expedition, the 25th Division was ordered to Gaza, as they were afraid of the English landing troops there. At that time i received instructions to go to Ibn and lay wares between Ibn, Bir-es-Saba, Khan Younes, Kalaat- el-Nakhl, and Arish. Having completed my work I returned to Ibn. The German General Staff headquarters vvere at Ibn. They bad vfith them 1,000 infantry troops, 1.000 dromedary riders (Hejin Sawari) and about 1,000 other troops including, engineers, general service men, &amp;c. I vans tvm days at Ibn and then was ordered to proceed to the Canal with the battalion of (Hejin Sawari) dromedary riders and Captain Krest, a German engineer who was going to lay mines in the Canal From4 Ibn we halted at El-Kabra an oasis where there is plenty of water. From there we proceeded to a p jsition named Tell Jemal Pasha thence we made our way to the Canal. We were detected and attacked by the English, and lost about 200 men. Captain Krest threw one mine in the Canal. We retreated, and on our way to Ibn we stopped at a position called Ikinji-el-Kabra, two days from the Canal, where we buried threg^ mines in the sand, 4 metres deep. The place where the mines were hidden li&lt;£k 2 kilom. north of a large pond in the centre of three mounds covered by trees. From Ikinji-el-Kabra we returned to Ibn. I was taken ill and went to a hospital in Bir-es- Saba. I came out two weeks later and asked to be relieved from telegraph service, and to rejoin the regular army at Gaza. I was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 75th Regiment, 25th Division. I was two months at Gaza. Owing to the failure of the expedition to Egypt and ill-treatment, the troops began to show signs of discontent and demoralisation. Desertions were a daily occurence, twenty to thirty every day. An order came from headquarters to shoot absentees without leave and deserters at sight whenever they were caught. This, however, did not improve matters. The daily bombardments of our camps by British warships contributed to add to the despondency of the troops. Men were killed and wounded by shell fire every day; as an instance, the 73rd Regiment lost twenty-five wounded and eight killed in one day. English aviators flew frequently over our camps and threw leaflets printed in Arabic stating that England was very friendly to the Arabs and was eager to deliver them from the opposition of the Turks. The proclamations urged the Arab officers and soldiers to desert, and that a very cordial welcome would be extended to them on board British warships, and would be well treated. The Turkish command sent men to collect all the leaflets, and gave strict ordersthat the soldiers should not pick them them up orread them ; many, however, got them and hid them. The impression made on the troops by these proclamations was very great. Since then some men who had been sent to the Canal to throw torpedoes gave themselves up to the English. At Gaza, Jemal Pasha took severe measures; soldiers were not allowed to approach near the sea shore. The Government, fearing a rebellion amongst the troops, and on account of increasing desertions, decided to send the 25th Division to Gallipoli. This decision, however, was kept secret, and the troops were told that orders had come from Constantinople to send them to Mount Lebanon. We left Gaza about the end of May, and proceeded in two days to Yououn- Kara, a Jewish colony near Jaffa. We stayed eighteen days and went to Aftuleh, where we were entrained for Damascus. It took us three days to reach Damascus, the wheels of the train slipping on the rails and backing, on account of the myriads of locusts that covered the tracks. At Damascus we were only allowed the tune to change trains and get on the Damascus-Beyrout Railway. We witnessed scenes of great commotion and despair at the station. Thousands of men, women, and children crowded the station and clamoured to see their sons and-relatives but were not allowed to get near the train, and were brutally pushed back by the soldiers and gendarmes. The train started amidst the cries of agony and imprecations of women and children. At Suk-Wadi-Barada the train stopped owing to bad fuel, and had to wait eight hours until better coal was despatched from Damascus. The soldiers who thought they were going to Lebanon were informed that the battalion was ordered to Aleppo. Very strict measures were taken at every station against desertion. Soldiers were not allowed to leave the train. I was refused leave to go to Beyrut and see some relatives, and having remonstrated, I was punished with twenty-four hours prison on the train. From Rayak we proceeded in two days to Aleppo, where we stayed two days. At Aleppo a proclamation was read to the troops that the Sultan informed of the brilliant deeds of our regiment in the Canal fighting, was very anxious to see the troops and confer honours upon them, and that we would be charged with the defence of Constantinople. Between Damascus and Aleppo twenty men deserted, throwing themselves out of the carriage windows at night, the train going very slowly. From Aleppo we marched in six hours to Kurd Keui. Then, in spite of all precautions, tour men from Nablus deserted, and one Egyptian who had passed to the Turks in the Canal fighting. From Kurd Keui to Katma in six hours, two deserted. Then in seven hours to Yeni Kupri, where eleven men deserted with all their kit and arms. We proceeded in eight hours to Takhta Kupri and another eight hours brought us to Isiahie. Here we rested for two days. We then marched to Hassan Bey, an Armenian village. There was not a single soul in the place, all inhabitants having been deported. I rom Hassan Bey we proceeded to Mamurie, and by train in one and a half hours to Tarsus, from bars us we marched to Kurd Musa where we rested for twenty-four hours. We proceeded to Kavakli Khan in seven hours, thence in ten hours to Tchanli Here, two men deserted. We marched eight hours to Gulak Benghazi, and anotherstage of fourteen hours to Bozanti. Here we rested two days. Then we proceeded in three^ days to Eregli, ^ where we had eight days training. From Eregli we were entrained to Tuzla Keui, where we were quarantined for two days. Then we marched t wo days to Iskidan. At Tuzla Keui we heard that a British submarine had entered ^the Bosphorus. From Iskidan we crossed the Bosphorus by steamer at night to Serkeji. Ail lights were put out tor fear of British submarines. From Serkeji we marched in three days to St. Stefano, where we arrived on Bairam day. I asked leave to go to Constantinople, but was refused. [ went just the same and spent eight days in Constantinople. I rejoined my battalion at Burgas Keui, and was not punished, having brought with me letters of recommendation from my uncle who is on the General Staff. Alter four days at Burgas Keui the battalion was ordered to Makri Keui, two days march. From there we were entrained to Kulali Burgas and marched to Uzun Kupri, Kapcham, aud Suleimanie (Zaros), where we arrived at night. We received strict orders not to smoke or make the slightest noise in order not to attract the attention of the British warships cruising in the Gulf of Zaros. At Suleimanie I had a quarrel with the commander of my battalion and was transferred to the fourth battalion of the same division. There I met my companion, Lieutenant Shukri Shurbaji. Lieutenant Shaykha’s Account of Dardanelles Operations. Lieutenant Shaykha was at Dardanelles from the 2nd September to the 13th October with 2nd Battalion 7oth Begiment, 25th Division, acting as reserve for 17th Corps; and Bak Pasha, a German. He was on the coast between Bulair and Kala’a Alti. On the 15th September he went to Gallipoli for eight days. He described the effect of the indirect fire of the monitors as very destructive ; the fire of our land artillery as ineffective. At the above-mentioned date the Turks had practically abandoned all hope ; the troops were despondent, over their heavy losses, and also the officers. There was little sickness, and the food supply w T as good. The f Turks never looked up until Bulgaria came in. He was told that on the 18th July the 4th and 15th Divisions were practically destroyed. The Turks were very rnudh afraid of a weapon called the Kar Torpil (land torpedo). Both Lieutenant Shaykha and Lieutenant Shurbaji are certain our prisoners were not murdered. The English were notorious for their bitter resistance. The Turks had no regard for the British except as Giaurs. There was a consistent campaign afoot to work up hatred against the British, on the score of bombardment of hospitals, white flag treachery, and use of hospitals as shelters for batteries. The normal force on and about the Peninsula was 250,000. Mr. Ashmead Bartlett’s articles in the Daily Telegraph ” used to be translated and read to the troops. They had a great effect in giving them hope and courage. Junior Captain Shurbaji says that the conduct of the British in failing to attack the small forces at Suvla Bay which opposed their landing was always a mystery to the Turks, who looked upon the day as lost. The troops which ultimately came up from Are Burnu, one division, were in a deplorable state, and half of them collapsed from heat and fatigue e7i route. General opinion in the Turkish army was that the English got off the Gallipoli Peninsula without loss because the Turks never imagined that they would go. The following is the Narrative of the Two Arab Officers, Junior Captain Shurbaji and Lieutenant Shaykha, from the Time they left Zaros with their Begiment on the 1st October, 1915 : — They proceeded to Uzun Kupri and thence to Derakoi, where they were stationed for fifty days ; the country around was very desolate, only old men, women, and children remaining; here they saw no fighting at all, but were much harassed by the British aviators, who inflicted constant casualties on the troops at Derakoi and in the vicinity’, the 1st October, 1915, to 10th November, 1915. From Derakoi they proceeded to Constantinople. At Constantinople the city was empty and depressed, the quiet gossip was about the systematic drownings and murders of Armenians by night, and the executions of Armenian leaders and notables by day. The city was beyond any hope of revolution, the hold of the committee being absolutely complete over every section [898—9] C6 I of the people ; both officers are of opinion that no revolution can ever be hoped for at Constantinople, as those who might have led have been exterminated, and those who would have followed have been dispersed. f rom Iskidar the battalion crossed the Bosphorus to Kaputash in the dark with all lights extinguished, owing to fear of British submarines. After refitting, the battalion proceeded to Haidar Pasha Station, entrained, and started for Bozant?; shortly after starting, the train was delayed four hours by a British submarine which was shelling the coast from the Gulf of Ismid. From Ismid to Bozanti the journey lasted seventy-two hours. The railway rolling-stock was good, but the locomotives showed signs of deterioration owing to the use of wood fuel. At Bozanti the troops were encamped for the night and proceeded to Tarsus in four marches, the battalion carried its own tents and equipment on 110 pack animals. The troops suffered con siderably from cold during the first three stages. The rations were Urbswurst soup in addition to Burgul, ghi, and mutton. The officers messed separately, and always had a three-course dinner cooked in European style. At Tarsus the battalion was detached from the division and delayed owing to an expected landing at Alexandretta or Ayas Bay , ibis delay lasted fifteen days, when the battalion entrained once more and proceeded to Maahmura (Osmanie) in six hours, detrained, and marched to Hassan Bey in tour hours, where it encamped, and proceeded by daily marches to Islahie-Takhta Kubri, Raju, Yeni Kubri, Katma, following the railway from Islahie, but not entraining owing to shortage of fuel and rolling-stock. At Katma the battalion entrained, reaching Aleppo in two hours. However, this last stage could only be accomplished by taking two companies at a time, as the locomotive could not get up sufficient steam to pull under wood fuel. r xileppo was reached about the 25th December. At Aleppo the battalion was halted about fifteen days, and Lieutenant Shurbaji was sent on duty to Damascus. The journey from Aleppo to_ Damascus occupied thirty hours by rail, the road was in fair order, the rolling-stock in good condition, and the shortage of fuel less noticeable. The main points this officer noticed on the way from Aleppo to Damascus was the result of the locusts in 1915, which had almost destroyed the crops and reduced the country to great poverty, the all-pervading typhus epidemic in Homs, Hama,.Baalbek districts, and the forcible migration of Armenians who were swarming south by road and rail. Lieutenant Shurbaji estimates that he saw 1,000 dead Armenians during the daylight hours or his journey, lying by the railway at various points. These people had perished from famine and typhus. The survivors were, on arrival at Haimi, near Damascus, dispersed among the various towns and villages where they were well cared for by the Arabs, but hastened the spread of typhus. At Damascus, Jemal was ruling by terror and force. The situation was as follows: the papers of the french Consulate at Damascus had been obtained early in tie war and the fact was secretly known to nearly everybody, and the Turks were o ding the papers in terrorism over the heads of the Arab notables, and occasionally hanging a man here and there. It would seem as if the papers from the Consulate at Bey rut had also been tampered with earlier than is usually supposed, but it is open to que^ ion. ^ aisal, the son of the Sherif, was in attendance on Jemal, and certain no caffes, viz., Ibish and the Emir El Haj were made much of as Turco-phils. . Committee was very powerful in Damascus, and Jemal could never ascertain its actual personnel or whereabouts, nor have the recent executions destroyed 1 ’ . u e ^ 10 ence the Turks having produced an Arab Committee as occult and elusive as the Lommittee of Union and Progress itself. About fifty officers and many sons of notables of Homs, Hama, and Damascus had &lt;&lt;'en ie uge m the Leja and Jehel Druse with the Druses, and were protected bj 7 the 1 ash ami y. I fie Arab Committee at Damascus arranged for these peoples’ passage from Damascus to Jebel Druse. It is estimated, that deserters and refugees inclusive, that m the Leja, Hauran, and Jebel, there were at that date (1st January, 1916) above ,JU armed men^ ready to rise in event of propitious circumstances. Lieutenant mi &gt;aji is 0&gt; opinion that this situation still holds good, and he is satisfied that the I if Ce f exec ^Lons in by ria have not had any fundamental effect on the power of the r . a , , oram dIee w ncn is secret enough to survive the disappearance of many individual As far as the Lebanon was concerned, Emir Arslan was the acting Governor, and T l \? ma 1(3 j 0 ' ie ^ lir ks and Jemal, i here was constant communication between the ebanon and Hauran Druses, the Druse policy was to maintain good relations with the Ty 0Ve ' nil V nL I ° U ° ^ lve ^ 110 0 PP 0I1 funity to strengthen its hold on them. A hundred luse vo un eeis were sent from Hauran in response to an appeal by Jemal, for a levy7 masse, these were low class men who subsequently deserted. Jemal’s policy in regard to the Hauran was to let sleeping dogs lie. While Lieutenant Shurbaji was at Damascus a Moslem was hanged for robbing an Armenian. ±his larce was enacted to impress the neutral consulates. ^ On returning to Aleppo Lieutenant Shurbaji rejoined his battalion and found tjqihus and dysentery raging. Henceforth the narrative gives the joint experiences of the two officers. The battalion left Aleppo on the 3rd February and reached Ras-ul-Ain in twel\ hours, passing the great bridge over the Euphrates, which was well guarded. At Has-ul-Ain some 12,000 Armenians were concentrated under the guardianship of some hundreds of Kurds, drawn not from the local tribes, but from the urban riff-raff of Mosul, Bit!is, and Diarbekir. These Kurds were called gendarmes, but were in reality mere butchers; bands of them were publicly ordered to take parties of Armenians, of both sexes, to various destinations, but had secret instructions to destroy the males, children, and old women, and dispose of the young women among the villagers of the Urfa plain. These Kurds always returned after absence of three or four days on such expeditions. One of these gendarmes confessed to killing 100 Armenian men himself on the various journeys he had taffien. The Armenians were dying of typhus and dysentery, and the roads were littered with their decomposing bodies. The empty desert cisterns and caves were also filled with corpses. Both officers agree that this was the most appalling state of allairs, and that, unless it had been a matter of ocular demonstration, it would be incredible. The Turkish officers of the battalion were horrified at the sights they saw, and the regimental chaplain,* on coming across a number of bodies, dismounted his horse and publicly prayed that the Divine punishment of these crimes should be averted from Moslems, and, by way of expiation, himself worked at digging graves for the dead bodies. When marching from Bas-ul-Ain to Er-Badi the soldiers of the battalion often put up their hands to avert the sight of the numerous bloated naked corpses of murdered women who lay by the roadside. Two sayings were common among the common soldiers: “ Bas-ul-Ain is a shambles” and “ No man can ever think of a woman’s body except as a matter of horror, instead of attraction, after Bus-ul-Ain.” Bus-ul-Ain was used as a place of concentration for Armenians, and 12,000 was the number usually there. The average number of the incoming parties and outgoing parties (viz., those going to be murdered) cannot be estimated accurately. / From Pvas-ul-Ain the battalion proceeded after two hours halt to Mosul, through the following halting places : Er-Badi, Tel-Ermen, Amudeh, Nisibin, Duker, Kir Bekil, Demir Kapu, Oqlat El Kujer, Owevnat, LIuqina, Zelazeh, Humeydat, Mosul. Between Nisibin and Duker the battalion had to take the precautions usually adopted in the presence of an enemy, owing to the existence of a Kurdo-Arab-Armenian Committee in the Tur Abdin, which raided this section of the line of communications at intervals. Between Oqlat El Kujir and Humeydat similar precautions had to be taken against th© Yezidis of Sinjar, who had chased away all Government officials in Sinjar, defied any attempt to tackle them on their own ground, and had frequently waylaid isolated bodies of troops. On this journey the supplies were well maintained, the men getting a good daily ration of Burgal mutton and occasionally bread, the biscuit issued was almost uneatable. On arrival at Mosul, the battalion was reduced from the original 1,300 men to 1,000, 250 having fallen by sickness (typhus and dysentery) and 50 having deserted. Junior Captain Shurdaji considers the sickness figures as above the average, but the desertion figures as below, owing to the battalion being a good one with a popular commander. At Mosul the officers visited two British aviators, who were housed in a filthy barrack and very discontented; saw eleven British and Indian officers with whom they did not speak —they were struck by the good fellowship subsisting between the British and Indian officers. They also saw 125 Indian soldiers, who appeared doomed to die of sickness and want, having no medicine or attention of any kind. The popular discontent at Mosul was excessive, but lacked any signs of organisation or leadership. After six days’ halt at Mosul the battalion embarked on rafts and proceeded in eight days to Samarra, the transport going by road, ihe river journey was without event, but precautions had to be taken each night. The transport was harassed by Arabs between Hamam Ali, Gayara, and lekrit. At Samarra the railway was working with 8 locomotives and about 100 trucks, all in good order, the train journey from Samarra to Baghdad occupied about four hours. The battalion airiveu at * A Moslem divine.8 Baghdad on the 26th February, 1916, and stayed there twelve days. The division to which the battalion belonged had gone to join the force at Kut, but the battalion was detached and sent to Kasr-es- Shirin. The situation at Baghdad was that there were neither horses or vehicles of any kind, that the population was almost denuded of men, most of whom were known 0 have perished in the Caucasus, that there was an absolute crisis over the Turkish paper money, which could hardly he made to pass, ihe remnants of the population hoped for a British victory and occupation, but were helpless. Numbers of troops from Baghdad deserted, and took refuge at Kerbela, where they formed a sort of republic, killing the Turkish Government officials. Indeed, to the assistance of these deserters with their arms and munitions, the officers consider must be attributed the real cause of the Turkish abandonment of Kerbela. The battalion left for Kasf-es-Shirin about the 7th March, proceeding along the following route : Khanat Ibn Said, Barcuba Khan, Abu Jezr, Sharriban, Khusabad, Khanikin, Kasr-es-Shirim The march was through safe calm country, well affected to the iurks. At Kasr- es-Shirin were gathered about 10,000 armed irregulars in German pay, recruited from Persia, officered by Persian gendarmes. These men seemed quite worthless, deserted freely, and were very unready to fight. The battalion was detailed as guard for Colonel Bop, the chief German officer in charge of operations at Kasr-es-Shirin, and performed this duty for four weeks. At Kasr-es-Shirin the officers came in^ contact practically for the first time with the Germans since leaving Constantinople. Hitherto they had hardly met a German, though it was a matter of common knowledge that most staff moves and political measures, such as the extermination of Armenians, were due to German advice or pressure. At Kasr-es-Shirin there were about eleven German and Austrian officers with an equal number of orderlies, mostly Austrian. The relations between the German and Turkish officers were extremely bad. The origin of the ill-feeling had arisen through friction between the well-known Turkish naval officer, Rauf Bey (ex-commander of the “ Hamideh ”), and Colonel Bop. Rauf Bey had been entrusted with an expedition of desperadoes, 600 in number, who were to force their way to Afghanistan and work up a Jehad. Rauf Bey had desired to follow a violent policy of terrorism in Persia, the German agents had objected on the ground that such action would set the population against them, and imperil isolated operators like Wassinuss. Matters reached a crisis in February when Fausi Bey was appointed to conduct an enquiry, he reported that, from a military point of view, Rauf was in the right, and that from a political point of view Bop was right. Rauf retired to Constantinople and Bop remained, and the friction increased. It was also stated that the Germans had desired to send an Austrian or German division to Persia, that the Ottoman Government had objected on the score that this would render the Jehad propaganda nugatory, and had arranged for a Turkish division to proceed to Kasr-es-Shirin, allowing it to be supplied and controlled by Bop and Yon Lebben. The battalion of the two officers making this report was a part of a mixed force carrying out this part of the Turkish bargain. Ihe Turks and Germans were not on speaking terms, one of them even coming to blows with Junior Captain Shurbaji, who reported the matter, and was acclaimed by his commander and the other Turkish officers. After four weeks the battalion returned to Baghdad, ten days being occupied in the journey owing to the overflowing of the “ Diala ” and the opening of the Barcuba pontoon bridge. The battalion left Baghdad on the 15th April and reached Kut on the 16th, arriving in the middle of the fighting, which continued for eight days. In the opinion of the officers Kut was almost relieved, and would have been had the garrison been able to make any effort to support the relieving force. The officers state that the Turks under-estimated the garrison, and that the garrison over-estimated the Turks, 4,000 men was the total number used to contain Kut. The officers also state that it was the general impression among the Turks that the Indian soldiers were badly trained, but that the British were extremely tenacious and plucky. W hen Kut surrendered, there were two matters of general comment; (1) the large numbers of the garrison, and (2) the completeness with which they had destroyed their weapons, stores, and munitions. Hardly a rifle or a cartridge was to be found. The British artillery was good, and the British infantry remarkable for their expenditure of ammunition in night firing. After the surrender of Kut nine Arab notables were hanged ; this piece of cruelty was to show that the British were either unable or unwilling to guard their friends. After the fall of Kut the hostilities w T ere confined to the British wasting ammunition. After three weeks’ stay the battalion returned to Khanikin, takingtwenty-nine marches and losing on the way about 350 from sunstroke, all of whom died. After five days at Kasr-es-Shirin the battalion engaged the Russians at Klirint- Mahadasht and Kermanshah. The Russian retirement was admirably conducted, not ^te man being left behind. At Kermanshah the battalion remained one month, having been reduced to 400 strong by heat-stroke and casualties. The Persians afc Kermanshah were at first glad to see the Turks, but regretted the Russians when they found that the Turks always paid in worthless banknotes. On arriving afc Kermanshah the Turks were checked by losses of baggage animals and the impossibility of replacing them owing to the Russians: having carried off all local animals. The stories of Russian ill-treatment of the Persians are quite baseless, the Persian feeling in favour of the Turks being only ordinary prejudice, and not very violent at that. While at Kermanshah the two officers learned of the Sherif’s rising, through aeroplane pamphlets dropped by the Russians, and determined to take the first opportunity to escape. Junior Captain Shurbaji had desired to go to Jebel Druse when at Damascus, but had been dissuaded by his father, who feared reprisals ; he awaited his opportunity, and on the pretext of leading a raiding party, with Second-Lieutenant Shaykha, managed to get behind the Russian lines and give himself up with his companion on the 2nd August. At Tiflis he met a Serbian officer who had been handed over to the Turks by the Bulgarians ; while with the Turks he had adopted Islam in order to obtain greater liberty; profiting by this he had dressed up as a Persian and escaped to the Russians. He informed both officers that their names had appeared as deserters in tlie orders of the Turkish Army. The Hejaz Railway. (Report by Second-Lieutenant Shaykh, ex-stationmaster at Amman.) Condition of the Line. —The line is by no means in good condition, and lacks solidity. The road bed from Amman to Medina is all sand, and needs constant care. Between each station fifteen or more workmen are employed in clearing the sand from the tracks. If the line is neglected for two days the sand piles up on the rails and makes the circulation of trains impossible. Stations from Amman to Medina —The following are the stations on the Hejaz Railway between Amman and Medina : El-Kasr, Khan-Zebib, Ei-Katrani, Kala’at-el- Hasa, Jifr-el-Darawish, Kala’at-Anayze, Kasr-el-Bint, Maan, Akhabet-el-Shamieh, Batn-el-Goul, Harat-el-Hamra, Mabrac-el-Naaka, Tobouk, Khadra, El-Mokaddam, El- Plamra, El-Hujairafc, Al-Ula, El-Zamurrud, Madaien-Saleh, Hadieh, Ei-Shwefat, El-Dwera, Medina. The line measures 1,375 kilometres from Damascus to Medina. Administration. —The general superintendent of the railway is a German. The station-masters are all Arab Moslems. The firemen were all French, Lebanese and Greeks before the war Italians were entrusted with the repair workshops. Turks are not employed on the line for fear of Arab assaults. Rolling-Stock. —The rolling-stock is interchangeable with the Beyrut-Damascus Railway. Second-Lieutenant Shaykha estimates the entire rolling-stock at about 1,400 units, comprising passenger and merchandise carriages and waggons, and twenty engines. Each train cannot carry more than one company of troops, unless double traction is used. The carrying capacity of the trains must be diminished a great deal at present on account of the deterioration of the engines by using wood for fuel, and the lack of lubricating oils. &lt; . . Safety of the Line. —The line has never been safe from incursions by the Bedawm. Even in peace time it had to be guarded the whole length from Amman to Medina. Verv often the Bedawin attacked the trains, and plundered and robbed the passengers. A favourite point for attack by the Kerak Arabs is a place called Istabel-Antar, 1 5 kilom. from Akabet-el-Shamieh. Here the Arabs held a strong position on a wooded hill near the line, where they hid themselves and attacked the train, as it had often to stop near by on account of the accumulating of sand on the rails. Another place at which the Arabs made systematic attacks on _ the trains is Mabrac-el-Naaka. The situation here became so unsafe that the station was closed and the trains went through without stopping. Two companies of infantry with two guns were detailed by the Turkish Government to guard the railway. But these have been probably withdrawn and sent to join the expedition against Egypt. Besides [898—9] D10 robberies, the Bedouins have frequently removed the rails and damaged the line. Once, in the neighbourhood of Mabrac-el-Naaka, they tied up the rails and attached them to a flock of about 800 camels on a length of 4 kilometres. Then they drove the camels forward, who carried away the rails for several miles in a wild gallop. Between Amm^ and El-Katrani there is a tunnel 1,500 metres long. Trains never pass the tunnel aT night for fear of a surprise attack by the Arabs. Water Supplies for the Engines.—The engines are supplied with water at the stations of Amman, El-Katrani, Ma’an, Tobouk, Madamen-Saleh, Medina. Besides, each train carries two tanks of water. Bail Stocks. —At each large station there was, before the war, a reserve stock of about 1,000 rails measuring a length of 5 metres each. The total reserve may cover 25-30 kilom. of line. Probably since the war a large portion of these rails has been transported for use in the Sinai Railway. Train Service. —Before the war there was a regular daily service of one passenger and mail train, and one, or sometimes two, goods trains. Means of Damaging the Line. —Junior Captain Shaykha believes that the Hejaz Railway can easily be partly destroyed and put out of action. Arabs friendly to the Sherif could easily remove the rails and destroy the line at several points. British aviators could easily reach the railway from Akaba, and, flying low, throw bombs on the line and destroy it at different points. At Akaba there is usually only one line of empty trenches and one company of Turkish gendarmes. A surprise landing of troops at Akaba can be easily effected almost without opposition. The force could proceed to Amman 60 miles and wreck the line before Turkish troops could be brought up. The following was the number and disposition of Turkish troops along the Hejaz Railway in peace time. Two companies of soldiers were stationed at Mabrac-el-Naaka and one at | Istabel-Antar. From two to ten soldiers were assigned to each station. The total | number was of about 500. The Arab Movement. (Report by Second-Lieutenant Shurbaji, Member of the Arab Committee in Damascus.) The Arab movement originated through secular and systematic oppression of the Arabs by the Turks, who always treated them wdth contempt as a conquered race, and persistently refused to grant them any privileges or any prominent show in the administration of their own provinces. An Arab movement has always existed, latent in the cities and villages for fear of persecutions, but open and defiant with the Arab tribesmen, who never recognised or accepted Turkish rule. During the last fifteen or twenty years the movement acquired some kind of organisation. Before the advent of the Young Turks, it was directed against the despotic rule of Abdul-Hamid, and during the revolution of 1908 the Arabs rallied to the Young Turks and supported them unreservedly, as the latter had promised them equal rights and all sorts of privileges. The illusion, however, vanished, and the Arabs found out, at their expense, that the Union and Progress rule was infinitely worse than Hamidian tyranny. The climax came after the Balkan war in 1912. Turkey was defeated, and the Arabs threatened an insurrection if the Government would not fulfil its promises of decentralisation in the administration of the Arab provinces of the Empire. A Congress was held in Paris in May 1913, to which were present over 400 repre sentatives from all parts of the Peninsula, including Moslems, Christians, Druses, and Jews. The iRrkish Government sent a representative, Abdul-Kerim-El-Khalil. (It is interesting to know that the latter and the President of the Congress, Abdul-Hamid- Alzabraoui, and two members, Abdul-Ghani-El-Arisi and Mohammed-Mahmasani, have been hanged by Jemal.) d he Congress held two private and one public sitting. The decisions were communicated to the Turkish Government. The Unionists fearing an Arab insurrection, gave in at the time, and actually started making some reforms. But as soon as the European war broke out they not only withdrew all their concessions, but also intensified the oppression of the Arabs, culminating in the hangings and deportations in Syria and the starvation of the Lebanese. The object of the Turks is to kill the Arab movement, but Second-Lieutenant Shurbaji assures that the lurkish crimes have contributed to strengthen it and to draw the Arabs in a closer union. ihe movement is conducted by a secret body of men whose names and headquarters —are unknown even to members of the Committee. Letters are headed Al-Badieh (The Desert). The organ of the Arab Committee used to be “ Al-Mufid,” published in Bey rout. When suppressed, it appeared under the title of £e Fatat-el-Arab.” Both the editor, Abdul-Ghani-el-Arisi, and the manager, Mir A’aref-el-Shihabi, have been nanged by Jemal. Second-Lieutenant Shurbaji believes that the Arab Committee was in constant communication with the Sherif, through the latter’s son, Feisaal. At Constantinople the Arab movement was kept alive by the Arab University students, who gathered in the Arab club, called Al-Muntada-al-Adabi-al-Arabi. Arab officers in Constantinople used to frequent the club. Selim-Bey-al-Jazaairih, Colonel in the General Staff, used very often to address the students. He also was hanged by Jemal Pasha at Constantinople. On the outbreak of the war, about 400 of the Arab students in Constantinople were made Deserve officers, and detailed to various fronts, but mostly to the Caucasus and the Dardanelles. The 300 Arab students of the Military College at Damascus were also made Deserve officers. Even in the army they are keeping up their aspirations for freedom and independance. They are undaunted, and have been seen marching through the streets of Damascus singing revolutionary songs against the Turks. Second-Lieutenant Shurbaji thinks that the young Arab officers are the backbone of the Arab movement. The Arab organisation is sound and complete. Christians, Moslems, Druses, and Jews are ready to rise up in arms and strike at- the first sign of intervention by the Allies. The aspirations of the Arabs are known. The principle object is to throw off the Turkish yoke. As to the Government and administration of the country, Second-Lieutenant Shurbaji states that the majority of the populations lean towards an autonomy, under the suzerainty of Great Britain. He admits, however, that the majority of the Lebanese and a number of Syrian Christians have a preference for France. However, both powers are looked upon as the saviours of the Arab race. The greater sympathy for England is a result of a comparison between French colonisation in Algeria and Tunis and British rule in India and Egypt. The following is an approximate estimate of the numbers of the disaffected armed men who would rise in Syria and Palestine if opportunity offered :— Place— Jebel Druse Nablus Lebanon ... Jebel Kalbie Number. 22.000 Druses. 8.000 deserters. 7.000 deserters. 20.000 Maronites. 10.000 deserters and local rebels. 67,000 The rank and file of the troops in Syria and Palestine are at least one-third Syrians, and disaffected. Forty per cent, of the officers are Syrians, and hostile to the Turks. N.B.—'No account is taken here of the Bedawins and Nomads of the Shameyih. THE SHEDIF OF MECCA. Capture of Taif. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 23rd September [No. 805] that the Sherif had reported the capture of the Turkish garrison at Taif; and on the 20th September [No. 811] he sent further particulars. Abdulla has taken 83 officers, 1,982 rank and file, 10 guns, 160,318 rounds of rifle ammunition, 275 of gun ammunition, and a large number of rifles and tents ; together with 72 civilian employes. Other Operations. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 24th September [No. 807] a report received from Colonel Wilson at ^Babegh, dated the 22nd September. He said that a long conference between Ali, Aziz al Masri, and Nuri had been held that morning on die “ Dufferin,” and that the following decision had been arrived at. Ali was to remain at Dabegh with at least 5,000 men, and Thissal [? Faisal] was moving to Al Makshush, aplace half-way between Rabegh and Yambo, at about 10 kilometres from the coast. He will have about 4,000 Arabs with Egyptian artillery—four mountain guns and four Maxims. He also said that there were 3,000 Arabs at Tail* and along the Turkish communications to Bir Darwish, and that they were to harry those communications as much as possible. If the Turks should descend on the Sultaneh road, Faisal will allow-h them to get well on their way and then attack them in the rear when they attack Ali^ at Rabegh ; to which place Aziz and Ali think the Turks mean to come eventually. Colonel Wilson had gone over the whole question with Aziz al Masri ; the latter asked for three quick-firing mountain batteries complete; if to be carried on mules, then the mules must be provided as well. Sir H. McMahon added that it appeared, from other information received, that the Turks did not get further along the Sultaneh road than Bir Abbas which is 50 miles from Medina. They were still reported to be there on the 20th September. It was further reported that they were short of provisions and had many deserters, and that they had not sufficient transport for serious advance. The situation, therefore , appeared more favourable, especially as the fall of Taif frees the Arab force under Abdullah, Aziz al Masri recently joined the Sherif from Egypt and has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of his forces. The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 25th September [Baba 57] that Nuri Bey Saacl had reported that the lurks had two [?] divisions with two aeroplanes in A.edina and its vicinity. And (apparently on the same authority) that in Medina there was one mixed regiment of three bat talions with three batteries of old pattern field guns ; at Bii El Mashi 800 men, the^ headquarters of a regiment with strong advance detachments at Ghayer and Sari, each of which consists of about a battalion each having two field guns and four maxims; at Bir Abbas on the Sultani road one full division with two batteries of quick-firing guns and three mountain batteries of the man type, and with four machine guns per regiment. There are contradictory reports as to the possibility of advance ; probably the transport is still defective. The Bureau also reported that Hussein el Mabeiriq was in the hills, and that his attitude was apparently doubtful. Further that Colonel Parker had an unsuccessful meeting near Wejd with Suhiman ibn Rufada, Shaykh of the Billi, whose attitude was uncompromising. He expressed sympathy with the Sherif, but definitely declared that he and his Arabs were allied with the lurks. Raids on the railway are therefore impossible at present through the Bilh country. .^ n following day it telegraphed again certain comments on the statement of . un -It sard to at aeroplanes had not, up till then, been reported in the air ; and that it was unlikely that the Germans would be allowed in Medina, so that it was to be presume t rat on y Turkish pilots and mechanics were available who would greatly reduce their value. Nun’s figures were then considered. The gist was, that there were rom thirteen to eighteen battalions, which with artillery and supply would make the two divisions he estimated the Turkish forces at; though from their heterogeneous and inferior elements they should be of much less fighting value than line divisions. io-day, the 17th beptember, a communication has been received from the Naval cm man er-m- nef m the East Indies stating that Rabegh is garrisoned by 5,000 of r lov® tr ° 0pS J Wel armed and wel1 under the cover of H.M. ships; and they shouid be m a position to hold their own against a Turkish attack, and that it will probably be possible to land the aeroplanes at Rabegh under cover of this force Arab Prisoners for Sherif. From telegrams sent from Simla to Cairo on the 16th and 19th September, it appears that 2o officers and either 232 or 234 rank and file, being Arab prisoners of war, were leaving Bombay for Jeddah to join the Sherif. Of the 5 officers and 125 gunners who were sent from Egypt, most of them Arab W V ^ TP? 0rt ’ IV ’ N - S -’ P- 2 J 102 returned to Suez on the 13th August Writing on the 1/th August, Colonel Wilson said [F.O. 182183] that to wYbh AlT hat r i e k Were under the lm P ression that they were released in order to live in the Hejaz until the war was over, and were never asked if they were willing TowtA^of t 6 ^ady fought for the Turks, they could not He dhfnot know iTtf 1 ’ and v at ‘A W , ould mean oertain death if they were captured, oi know if the sounding of these men as to their willingness to fight for theOther Help for the Sherif. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 17th September [No. 794] that, as the present crisis can only continue for two or three weeks, assistance given by the French Government x-is unlikely to arrive in time. The Naval Commander-in-Chief is making arrangements lo increase the number of warships on the Hejaz coast temporarily. The main thing is to keep up the spirits of the Arabs, and for that reason he still urges the sending of a flight, or even of half a flight, of aeroplanes, which the Sherif has so urgently asked for. The Sherif s Stamps. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 16th September [No. 1447 (It)] that the Russian Government had no objection to an issue of stamps by the Sherif for the duration of the war. On the 18th September the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon [No. 755] that as a temporary measure for the duration of the war, the Allied Governments had agreed to the issue of stamps, and asked him to telegraph the date of issue. [The “Near East” of the 22nd September gives a reproduction of “the first specimen to reach England of a new issue of postage stamps ” made by the Sherif of Mecca. “The issue,” it says, “consists of three values, i.e ., one piastre (very dark blue), half-piastre (red), and quarter-piastre (green).”] French Mission to the Sherif. Reuter reports the arrival of the French mission at Jeddah and of the French Moslem pilgrims at Port Said [“Morning Post,” 23rd September]: also that the Sherif has telegraphed to M. Poincare expressing satisfaction at the arrival of the mission and his thanks for the interest the French nation had shown towards Islam, and that M. Poincare has replied thanking the Sherif for his warm reception of the mission, and assuring him of the sincere good wishes of the French nation for the success of his arms. [Ibid., 26th September.] The Haj. In a despatch dated the 4th September the Consul-General at Algiers reported that the Algerian Government-General had, by advertisement in the local newspapers, offered to send a party of Arabs on a pilgrimage to Mecca. All passage and food expenses as far as Jeddah, and from that port back to Algiers, were to be paid by the Government. [F.O. 181,437.] In a report dated the 24th August, a copy of which was forwarded by Sir H. McMahon on the 5th September, Colonel Wilson said that there was no doubt that the Sherif realised the importance of the pilgrimage being a success and of the pilgrims being well looked after ; his orders to that effect were stringent. It remained to be seen how they wuuld be cained out. [F.O. 182,184.] The “ Times ” correspondent in Cairo telegraphed on the 21st September that the Holy Carpet left for Mecca on that day, and that it was accompanied by a large number of Egyptian pilgrims. [“ Times,” 23rd September.] The Sherif and the Moslems of the Far East. In “Arabian Report,” N.S., No. IV (page 3), it was recorded that the G.O.C. in the Straits Settlements had reported on the 7th August that the Arab feeling in that place in regard to the Sherif and his move was satisfactory, and that tie sympathies of other Mohammedans were gradually inclining to the Sherif; that in the Federated States indifference prevailed, though in one ol them the Malays weie in * sympathy with the Arabs; and that in Java there was diversity of opinion. _ A despatch, dated the 15th August, from General Ridout, the G.O.C., is now to hand [W.O., I.S., 477]. He gives information regarding Mr. Algasoff, who made a free offer to the British Government of houses possessed by him at Jeddah; and speaks of the steps taken by himself at the very outset of the revolt to guide “ m an unostentatious way, Mohammedan feeling in the Far East as far as possible, and to draw attention to the misrule of Turkey. ” EX 14 Annexed to the despatch is a copy of a telegram to dated the 25th August, informing him that the Indian Government did not wish any portion of his telegram of the 7 th August to be published. IDKISI OF ASIR. The Resident at Aden telegraphed to Simla on the 15th September [252 A.P.], suggesting that the moment was opportune for the conferring an honour on Idrisi • the doing so would certainly serve as a sop after his recent humiliation at Comfida. The Resident is of opinion that too much capital should not be made of his comparative inaction ; this has not been without cause up to date, and his long enmity with the Turks is a useful asset to us. Ab the last moment the copy of a long rambling letter, dated the 20th August, from Idrisi to the Resident at Aden, casting aspersions on British officers, has come to hand ; it is printed in Appendix G. IBN SAUD. I he Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 19th September [I.O., P. 3827], in regard to suggestions recently made by the C.P.O. at Basra: (1) He said that the policy of encouraging an Arab State or confederation of States was not dead [as had been suggested], and that any repudiation of it should be avoided. (2) That any reference to the treaty with Ibn Saud should be confined to article 1 [see Arabian Report, IX, N.S., p. 3], as it could not be admitted that article 2 was bindino- on us as against other Arabs. (3) Ibn Saud should be encouraged, as proposed, to unite with the Sherif in his own interests and that of other chiefs. (4) The question of communicating the treaty with Ibn Saud to the Sherif was under consideration. [The agent of the Arab Bureau at Basra has reported to Cairo that sons of two well-to-do inhabitants had recently reached that place from Damascus by way of Medina and _ Koweyt, having escaped disguised as Bedawin. They reported that Qasim, Anaizah, and Buraidah were completely under the control of Ibn Saud.] IBN RASHID. Basra agent of the Arab Bureau also reports, on the same authority as above, that it was thought unlikely that Ibn Rashid would oppose the Sherif; but much more that he would loot Tewfik Ibn Faraon, Turkish emissary to Ibn Saud, who had left Medina by the same caravan as the Basra young men and had quitted it at uraidah He came to buy on behalf of the Turks, and was believed to have 20 000L or 30,000k with him. MASKAT. Q+k laS ^ S °^i e tiaS COme from Maskat &gt; though nothing of a date later than the 9th August. The C.P.O. at Basra reports to the Arab Bureau that then but little interest was taken m the Sherifs revolt. The Sultan had observed that he had for ong ee n an advocate of the course adopted, and had expressed satisfaction at the reports of the Sherd s successes. The Khojas, a large element of the British Moslem subjects, disbelieved, or were indifferent to, the stories. Most of the Sunnis, who cr V e « tle r ®P orts ’ saw them matter for satisfaction; many, however, did not credit them and some resented the Sherif s action. BAHREIN. New® bas also come from Bahrein, though here again nothing is of later date than the beginning of August. In a report, dated the 1st August, Captain Fowle, officiating po i ica agent, reports on the state of feeling. He sums 1 up thus :— Turkish r^l° ^ a ^ iran ^ s ’ e ^ ier ^hia or Sunni, have, or ever will have, any desire for n 2 ‘ ,“^ s W as the Turkish Empire remains an entity there will always be, mongs re Sunnis, an under-current of pro-Turkish sympathy, and since this en imen is ased as much on political as on religious grounds, it will not be verymuch affected by occurrences lowering only the religious prestige of Turkey— though, of course, the Hejaz revolt is of military and political significance also. 3. “ The Bahraini Shias, alienated by the Turkish atrocity at Kerbela, are a at present anti-Turkish, and will in all probability remain so, especially 4 if kept up to the mark ’ by further propaganda.” But on the 9th August he sent a memorandum to the C.P.O. at Basra (who transmitted a copy of both report and memorandum to the Arab Bureau) saying that from opinions expressed by a trustworthy individual he was inclined to believe that the pro- J urkish and anti-Sherif feeling was somewhat stronger than he had previously indicated. But the same individual also expressed the opinion that the people of Bahrein were more interested in the pearl market than in religio-political matters which took place in foreign parts. KOWEYT. At the same time the C.P.O. reported that the first news of the Sherif’s revolt created some stir in Koweyt, but that the interest had then subsided. There was, he said, considerable divergence of opinion ; but, generally speaking, the Koweyt attitude was one of expectancy combined with some sympathy for the Turks in that the Sherif had taken advantage of the difficulties in which the war had involved them. PART II. POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. Situation unchanged. The Caucasus. [Nil] PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. The Arab Bureau. The Bureau has issued its report for August. Since the departure of Lieutenant- Commander Hogarth, R.N.V.R., Captain Cornwallis has been director. The instalment of Colonel Wilson at Jeddah has thrown much additional work on the Bureau, which has also been able to assist the military authorities in the preparation of a map of Syria on a scale of 1/500,000. It hopes that Lieutenant Nalder, R.N.V.R., Political Officer of the Red Sea Patrol, will soon be appointed its correspondent in the Southern Red Sea, and that he will be able to devote some of his time to research work, as the “ Handbook of Asir ” is necessarily inaccurate and incomplete, and first-hand knowledge of the tribes and their boundaries will be of importance when His Majesty’s Government is called upon to arbitrate between the Sherif and Idrisi. Trade with Jeddah. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 22nd September [No. 803] in answer to an enquiry from Mr. Chamberlain in regard to trade with Jeddah. He said that between Egypt and Hejaz a limited amount of strictly controlled trade by steamers was allowed. The Khedival Mail Company sent a steamer weekly to Hejaz, which met local needs, and he deprecated any extension of commercial relations for shipment.Javanese Pilgrims in Mecca. On the 17th August Sir EL McMahon telegraphed [No. 702] that Colonel Wilson had reported that there were 1,500 Javanese pilgrims in Mecca, of whom the Sherif was anxious to get rid. The Foreign Office requested Sir A. Johnstone to inform the Netherlands Government, and to ascertain whether it wished His Majesty's GovernmeiC to take action, as there was no Dutch consul in Jeddah. On the 11th September Sir H. McMahon telegraphed again [No. 771] saying that there were then about 3,500 destitute Java pilgrims in Hejaz, of whom about 2,000 were Dutch subjects. On the 16th September Sir A. Johnstone telegraphed [No. 1143] that the Netherlands Government had made arrangements during the last three months for the repatriation of the pilgrims, and as those still in Hejaz had remained of their own accord they did not desire to avail themselves of the offer of His Majesty’s Government. 1 he Minister of Foreign Affairs told Sir A. Johnstone that the majority of the Netherlands subjects now in Hejaz were not, properly speaking, Javanese pilgrims but people who came from different islands of the Indian archipelago and established themselves in Mecca, or were born there of pilgrims. Turkish Designs on Red Sea Littoral. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 17th September [No. 793] that the Sherif had sent him note-books found on Germans in Hejaz, attacked by Arabs last May. From these and other sources of information it appears that the Germans had intended to use Hejaz and Yemen as a basis of operations against us. The German expeditionary force, which reached Medina last May, had planned to advance by way of Mecca and Comfida to Sanaa, to threaten Aden, to attempt the destruction of British commerce, and to stir up trouble on the African coast, in Abyssinia, and in Somaliland. It was the arrival of this force that compelled the Sherif to’ revolt sooner than he had intended, and by so doing he saved us from serious trouble. If Germans and Turks regain Hejaz they will resume these attempts ; and this is a cogent reason for helping the Sherif to the utmost we can. Gazetteer of Arabia.

Circulation of Vernacular Paper in Lower Mesopotamia. f Basra, August 14, 1916. While the circulation of the English edition of the “ Basra Times ” has mounted steadily until it is now close on four times that of last February (2.300-2,500 as against 610) the circulation of the vernacular edition has remained with slight fluctuation at about the old level:—- some weeks been trying to arrive at the causes thereof, especially with a view to remedying any radical defects in our methods. On the whole the results of this research have been gratifying. I summarise thus :— 1. The number 700-800 represents probably very nearly the maximum we are number of literate natives. (This on the authority of intelligent local natives and of Captain Young, late A.P.O., Basra.) must be remembered that each copy that is bought probably serves not only several readers but a still larger circle of hearers. so far as the number of native readers seems to be slightly on the decrease we find not a slackening of interest in the news but a tendency to buy the English edition as being fuller and sometimes fresher (see footnote*). It seems that it is increasingly the fashion for any Arabs and Persians who know English to translate the English paper to an admiring circle in the coffee houses. r r * present modest sale as reflecting either on the interest taken by the local population in the Basra Times or on the zeal and intelligence of the £&lt; Basra Times ” m catering foi its public and pushing its wares, and no need for us to do more than we are doing to keep the paper before the native public. The settled lands watered by the tv\o great rivers of Mesopotamia are bordered to the south and west by deserts _ which are the home of nomad tribes. The line of demarcation between the Bedouin and the fellaheen is not, however, an ethnological frontier nor is it a sharply defined economic or political boundary. The cultivator of nee neidb and palm gardens is ol the same race as the wanderer in the desert; in the past and often in a past not very remote^ his forebears dwelt in the black tents; his habits of life have undergone little radical change, and his ways of thought have suffered no alteration. After the winter rains half the village will revert to a nomadic It is true that the Engtish paper is frequently twenty-four hours ahead of the vernacular with its 110 W S l i. Because the vernacular has to go earlier to press. Both the papers have to be printed by the one machine, and the shorter run of 700 odd has to be got off before the run ot 2,300 odd begins. &gt;ecause i news aruves at the last minute it necessarily takes longer to have it translated and publisiied than to publish it in its original form. In the main, however, all telegrams are triplicated and handed simultaneously to the English, Persian, an- papers, anc no eLorts are spared to keep the vernacular papers abreast of the latest news.

The Independent Chiees of Eastern Arabia.existence ; with their tents and household goods borne on donkeys, they will drive their flocks out in to distant grazing grounds, where they will remain until the grass has wit leieo and the water pools are exhausted. Hospitality in turn is extended by them to their neighbours in the wilderness, who in the height of summer come in to the ^permanent waters and to the comparative sufficiency of pasturage near the rivers. But the dependence of the desert upon the cultivated lands implies much more than a summer visitation from the outlying tribes. The desert does not produce so much as the necessities of existence; not even the oases of Central Arabia are self- supporting, and nowhere are there any industries for the manufacture of the elementary utensils which the Bedouin require, the clothes they wear, or the arms with which they defend themselves from their enemies. For all these essentials they must come to the inland towns and to the seaports and they must, therefore, remain on good terms with the people who inhabit them and with the Government which can forbid them access to the markets. Thus it is that not only can remote parts of Arabia be controlled from without, but the rulers of the settled countries must inevitably find themselves thrown into economic and political relations with the independent Sheikhs whose wants they only can supplv. Before the occupation of Busreh, the British Government had already come into contact with the Chiefs of Eastern Arabia, but except for a treaty with I bn Saoud in f 86'j we had confined our dealings strictly to those whose territories bordered the sea. With the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast, and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit. we had long had agreements, some of which dated back as early as 1820, our main objects in every case being the preservation of commercial security in the Gulf and the suppression of traffic in slaves and in arms. Our interests were brought more sharply into line with those of the Sheikh of Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf when, in 1899, certain foreign Powers seemed to be turning their attention to Koweit as a possible terminus of a Mediterranean-Baghdad line. The Sheikh saw in that suggestion a fatal end to the position of virtual independence which he had succeeded in maintaining; the British Government saw in it the ominous beginning of a Teutonised Turkish supremacy over waters which, for more than a century, we had policed and lighted, and where our trade was still of greater value than that of any other country. We cut short years of dalliance with Ottoman suscepti bilities, during which the Sheikh had never felt certain whether as a last resource we would or would not support him in his efforts to checkmate the pretensions of Constantinople, threw our influence into his scale, and extended to him such protection as the nominal subject of another Power could enjoy. A year and a-half before the outbreak of war with Turkey, another potentate, who for years past had been seeking for an opportunity for closer relations with Great Britain, forced himself into our line of political vision. Ibn Saoud, ruler of Nejd, that is to say, of the, oases and deserts of Eastern Arabia, overran the province of Hasa, which had formerly been in the possession of his house, and pushed down to the shores of the Gulf, ejecting the three small garrisons which upheld the rule of the Sultan. Abdul Aziz Ibn Saoud, perhaps the most striking figure in recent Arabian history, has known every vicissitude of fortune, though he is not yet past middle age. He and his father were turned out of Biyadh, their capital, by their northern rival, the Amir of Jebel Shammar, Mohammed Ibn Rashid, who was the dominating personality of his day in Northern and Central Arabia. For several years Ibn Saoud wandered in exile, seeking refuge for a time in the Syrian desert, in the tents of the great Anazak tribe, with whom he claimed kinship, while his father found hospitality with the Sheikh of Koweit. But when, in 1897, Mohammed el Rashid died, leaving no man of his own remarkable quality to succeed him, Abdul Aziz was not slow to seize an^ opportunity. Aided by the Sheikh of Koweit, he rode into Riyadh with a small picked band of followers, and, by a master stroke of daring, recovered the town. The tale of his entry at the dead of night, of the swift overthrow of Ibn Rashid’s vice-regent, and of the subsequent years of contest with the Sbammar, which ended in the re-establishment of his supremacy over Central Arabia, has already grown into an epic on the lips of Bedouin storytellers and songmakers, and when this hero of many battles swept over the Hasa the Ottoman Government was not a little perturbed. The Turks had lavished gifts on Mohammed Ibn Rashid and his successors and studiously cultivated their friendship, hoping through them to maintain some measure of influence in Central Arabia. Ibn Saoud’s success was not only a direct hit at their claims to sovereignty, but also the extension of his authority to the Gulf presented the signal danger of opening the deserts to the dreaded influence of that watcher of coasts, Great Britain. Whether we should have been able to preserve our policy of non-interference with20 Central Arabian affairs, or whether the proximity of Ibn Saoud to the sea would ultimately have drawn us, as the Turks feared and as he wished, into direct relations with him need not now be determined. The outbreak of war brought our consideration for the Turks to an end, and as soon as he was assured of our friendship Ibn Saoud cast away all shadow of allegiance to the Sultan. ^ The occupation of Busreh must inevitably bring us into touch with Ibn Rashid and the Shammar ; for though the building of the Medina Railway has made it possible to travel from Hail to Damascus in less than a week, the commercial intercourse of Ibn Rashid’s oasis is all with the markets on the Euphrates. Every spring the Amir’s caravans, 500 or 600 camels strong, make the fortnight’s march from Hail to the Irak to replenish the stores of corn and oil, tea, coffee, and sugar which the unlimited hospitality of his palace demand, as well as to purchase the garments with which every tribesman who pays his respects to Ibn Rashid must be presented, in accordance with his rank and importance. By camel caravan the merchants of Najef furnish their partners settled in Hail with the stock-in-trade of the bazaars. Of the markets frequented bj the Shammar two are already in our hands. The little towns of Zubair and Khamisiyeh, outposts in the desert, depending respectively upon the metropolitan Busreh and the provincial Souk-el-Shuyoukh, the “market of Sheikhs” on the Euphrates, are in the occupied territories. The seaport of Koweit is administered by our firm ally. Ibn Rashid, therefore, unless he be willing to keep the peace with us, will be reduced to seek his supplies higher up the Euphrates, and even there he is beginning to find access difficult. By sea and land we hold the eastern neck of the Arabian bottle. The Shammar have suffered since the death of Mohammed Ibn Rashid from inefficient and imprudent leading and from family jealousies, resulting in bloody upheavals in the ruling house. The present Amir is a boy of 18, untrained in statecraft, ungoverned in temper, and lacking in wise advisers. He clings blindly to the old policy, -which has hitherto proved very profitable, of close.adherence to Turkey, and shows no leanings towards the pan-Arab sentiment, with which from time to time the Sheikh of Koweit and the ruler of Nejd have coquetted—for reasons not strictly connected with an Arabian patriotic revival. Under the Amir’s feeble rule the tribe is, as might be expected, divided against itself, but the Shammar are a proud and valiant people, possessors of their full share of desert virtues, and obedient to their old ideals and desert conduct. They must always be a factor in Arabian politics, and a turn of the wheel might restore to them much of their former supremacy. One other great tribal group touches the Euphrates. The Anazah, most powerful of all purely nomad confederations, roam the Syrian desert from the borders of Mesopotamia to the eastern frontiers of Syria. They wander north almost to Aleppo, and in those northern regions cross the Euphrates and occupy the rich pastures of the Khabur. Over this wide area more than one Sheikh bears sway. The tribe is divided into four main sections, of whom the Amarat come up to the confines of the Irak. Their paramount chief, Fahad Beg Ibn Hadhdhal, is nominally the ultimate lord of all Anazah, though, in fact, his western neighbour, Ibn Shaalan, who commands the Syrian side of the desert, is a more notable personage. Unlike the Amir of Jebel Shammar and the ruler of Nejd, Fahad Beg has no fixed abiding place. He lives with his tribe, true people of the Camel, who follow where their grazing herds lead them. Yet the strong castles of Ibn Saoud and Ibn Rashid are not more impressive to the imagination than lahads encampment. In spring you may find him in the grassy steppes of the Syrian desert, with a couple ol hundred tents around him, widely scattered in complete security from attack, and during many hours before you reach him you ride through his camel herds, for the Anazah are the greatest of all breeders. The old Sheikh, seated on fine carpets in his guest tent, with his hawk and his greyhound behind him, offers a picture of tribal dignity which the walled cities and lofty halls of the Central Arabian Princes and their troops of armed slaves cannot rival. I he Amarat scarcely come as far down south as Samawah, on the Euphrates, their market towns being Kerbela and Najef and smaller settlements higher up the rivers. A certain amount ol Syrian merchandise—wearing apparel and cotton goods—reaches them also through the enterprise of Damascene traders, but for provisions they are dependent on Northern Irak, and, therefore, on those who rule it. Fahad Beg himself owns some valuable palm gardens which are watered from the Euphrates, and whoever controls the river has some grip on the sources of his private fortune. The Ottoman Government, save for its constant regard for Ibn Rashid’s friendship a relic of Abdul Hamid’s statecraft—followed no consistent policy in its dealings with semi-independent Sheikhs. The Pasha had no sympathy with nomad Arabs, and the half-educated townsman of Constantinople or Salonica, who misguided the fortunes of®Ss 21 the State throug-h the Committee of Union and Progress, looked upon them as abhorrent relics of barbarism. A strong Governor of the Irak would chasten them, per aps not v holly without reason; but under his weaker successor their liberty ran ^veu more wildly into licence. Nazim Pasha might have held them firmly, if not wisely, put the high positions of the Turkish hierarchy were precarious eminences, and after nme months of office at Baghdad the jealousy of the Committee brought about his overthrow. Yet the task of controlling the tribes of the desert should not be one of the most difficult problems of Mesopotamian administration. The diplomatic parleying^ ana the alarums ot war which sound among the tents, the wildernesses which change hands, and ^the dynasties which topple down are of no concern to the rulers of the settled lands. It is enough for them that the de facto master of the waters should show respect for ironuier, road and rail, and for outlying cornfields. Rewards for the observance of agreements are easy to devise—they are familiar and time-honoured in all intercourse with tribal countries ; but for any breach the closing of the markets of Irak and the Gulf is a swift and sure retribution. [From the “ Near East,” 15th September, 1916.] APPENDIX (D). Public Opinion in Egypt. [From “Arab Bulletin,” No. 17.] The fellaheen of Egypt, those that live in the villages of the provinces and cultivate the lands of Egypt, have always been less keenly interested in this war than the townspeople. But in the beginning of the war they seemed to think like the rest of the Egyptians that Germany will win and that Egypt will be once more a dependency of the Moslem Sultan of Turkey who is the ally of “ Hajj Ghallioum.” The idea gave pleasure to those whose lands were mortgaged to European banks or were indebted themselves to foreigners. Now things have changed altogether. There is not 1 per cent, of the village population that still believe Germany will win or the Turks will rule Egypt. The rural population of Egypt is now convinced that things will remain in Egypt as they are, that all the changes are over, that the English have taken Egypt and that their ruler has become a Sultan of Egypt under British protection. Turkish raids in Sinai seem not to affect them more than the raids on the Western or the Eastern front in Europe. I was in my farm at Soufieh in Kafr Sakr District (Sharkieh Province) when the battle of Romani took place. I heard the booming of guns very distinctly and when I asked the natives on my farm what that meant, they answered me in the most indifferent way : “ It is the English firing at the Turks who are raiding in the desert,” and they took no more notice of it whatever. All the people of Egypt have grown very tired of the war. “ When will it end ? ” is the first question they generally ask when war is mentioned. It is the rise of prices of imported things on the one hand, and the difficulty of borrowing money now-a-days on the other, that makes them especially wish the war will soon end, not to speak of the general wish of mankind for the cessation of bloodshed. Before the Allies began their offensive on the Eastern and Western fronts, Egyptians seemed to believe that the war will end with no decisive victory from one party or the other of the combatants, but that peace will be concluded on the same terms as things were before the war. The idea gave some relief to those who were anxious for the maintenance of Turkey as the only Moslem independent Power. But the great offensive of the Allies, the victories that have been won by England and France, and by Russia and Italy, have altogether changed that belief, and there are few Egyptians now who do not admit that during the last six weeks or so, the Allies have been showing themselves stronger and their enemies weaker than they seemed to be before. They believe the catastrophe will begin with Austria or with Turkey, though they try to avoid naming Turkey when they discuss questions of the war. But when the name of Turkey is brought into the discussion they begin by levelling curses at the head of Germany and the German Emperor for dragging Turkey into tais war. After the Germans, the Young Turks of the Union and Progress are the objects of their anger. They have nothing but abuse for them. But it is “ a contra coeur that they mention these bitter facts—the wrong-doings of the Young Turks, I mean, as [898—9] G22 they cannot help counting them for the time being the pillars of the Khalifate and the only independent Moslem Power with which they believe it is their religious duty to sympathise. But the recent events between Turks and Arabs seem now to puzzle them. Moslem Egyptians profess to be Arabs and are very proud of their Arab origin. They consider^ I it an insult to be called the descendants of the Ancient Egyptians like the Copts. But this feeling is not based on real racial grounds, but purely on religious grounds. They consider it an honour to be called Arabs, -because the Prophet was an Arab and Islam had its rise in Arabia, and their sympathy with the Arabs is based on religious grounds, like their sympathy with the Turks. They admired the Turks for massacring Armenians, and never sympathised with Syrians who groaned under the Turkish yoke, because they believed it was only the non-Moslems who suffered. Even when Moslem Syrians began to complain, they showed themselves against them and with the Turks, believing it was only a minority of discontented Moslems who complained. But now that it has been made quite clear to them that it is not a question of Moslem against a non-Moslem, but a question of the Moslem Turk against the Moslem Arab, they seem like one who has been taken by surprise and does not know what to do. I gather from the many persons who discussed the subject with me both in the Capital and in the provinces, that they are now in a state of expectation, and have not yet made up their minds. They still lean towards Turkey because the Khalif is still the ruler of Turkey, and because he still figures as the most powerful and independent Moslem ruler. The influence of Germany in Turkey is to them quite different from the influence of the English in Egypt or the French in Tunis and Morocco. The Sultan of Turkey is still considered by them outside Christian protection. But the fact that the Shenf of Mecca is challenging Turkey in the name of the Arabs and of Islam makes them pause to see if he will prove more powerful than the Turk. If he should succeed in his cause and should drive the Turks out of his country and show that he is able to protect Islam, I have no doubt that all Egyptians will lean to him and morally support him against the Sultan of Turkey. l^.B.—This report is from a pro-entente newspaper editor who spent the summer on his estates in the provinces. It represents what the non-intelligent peasant thinks he thinks, while he is talking to a richer man whom he knows to be pro-British. Had he been talking to a red-hot Turk his opinions (equally sincere) would have been less favourable to us. The point is really that the men of this class are painstaking chameleons, who would not for worlds be thought to have no mind at all, but who cannot lor long conceal that their main interest is in the cotton worm. the effect of the attack on the Canal and the rumours to which it has given rise among large classes of the population may rightly be considered as a subject of ridicule. The fact that such rumours, however, really obtain credence and are firmly believed, is not without interest and merits consideration. It proves once again that there are no bounds to the credulity of an Eastern population. As regards the Moslem population this credulity, however, is undoubtedly increased by the “ wish being father to the thought.” It once again emphasises the fact that, in spite of the recent Allied successes in Europe and lurkish defeats in Armenia, the Germans and Turks are still firmly held to be in the ascendant and are stiil the chosen of the Moslems in Egypt. After two years of war, therefore, there has been no change of opinion, and Great Britain as a military Power is still considered a negligable quantity 7 . As to an attempt at concerted action, from within, to aid the Turks, very careful enquiries were being made during and subsequent to the attack, and as a result it can be said that there was no trace of any such. There was indeed much activity on the part of evilly disposed persons who sedulously spread rumours as to the crossing of the Canal by the enemy, tne capture of Pott Said and Ismaiha, Ac. The only tangible results they achieved, however, was to succeed in inducing some families to pack up and prepare tor flight. Hie absence of concerted action last week does not necessarily prove that the elements that made for concerted action do not exist. For with the enemy 25 miles distant from the Canal (which would be well enough known to those that meant business) it can hardly be said that the circumstances were favourable. finally, therefore, what has appeared is: Firstly, that the population has lost nothing m credulity. Secondly, that this credulity, if things went badly for us, would easi y ris ^ to a panic. thirdly, that there still exists a good number of evilly disposed persons ready 7 to exploit both the above, and lastly, that a more determined effort On uhe part oi “ the enemy in the gate ” to relieve those within the city 7 will berequired if the former hope to induce the latter to emerge from the obscurity into which prudence, and the knowledge that they are all well-known to the authorities has at present driven them.] ’ APPENDIX (E). The Rebellion against the Sultan of Maskat, May 1913-July 1916. [Written by Miss Geetruue Bell.] The rebellion against the Sultan of Maskat is due partly to old and deep-seated matters of disagreement and partly to the reflex action of modern European politics in the Uruh on the internal affairs of Oman. Chief among the former causes of unrest is the curious and interesting survival in Oman of the very ancient rivalry between the Ahl Qibli and the Ahl al Shimal, the southern tribes of Yaman origin and the northern tribes descended from Nizar ibn Ma'add, represented respectively in Oman by the Hmawi and Ghafiri groups. Though these two factions, which are almost identical with the older divisions, did not spring into existence as actively hostile elements until the civil wars which rent Oman in the 18th century, they revived an enmity which goes back to the days before the Prophet. Roughly speaking the Ghafiri or Nizarites are at present with the Sultan, while the Hinawi,or Yarnanites, are with the Imam. A second and' very fertile source of division between the Sultan and his subjects in the interior was the transference of the capital in 1784 from Rustaq, in the Wadi Para, to Maskat. This was done by Hamad, son of the Imam Said ibn Ahmad. Said, son of the founder of the Al Bu Saidi dynasty, was the last elected Imam of Oman to hold sovereign power, and when he was forced to abdicate in favour of his more capable son, he was left to vegetate at Rustaq while the seat of Government was moved to the coast. Thereby the rulers of Oman were assured of an easily collected customs revenue enabling them to preserve a semblance of authority by bribery alone, they were absolved from the necessity of maintaining themselves by military and political efficiency, and exposed to foreign influences which alienated from them the sympathies of the tribes in the interior. To these foreign influences, to the reliance of the Sultans of Maskat on foreign naval and military power, and their enforced submission to foreign requirements in the matter ol the traffic in slaves and in arms, the modern causes of unrest belong. The late Sultan, Saiyid Faisal ibn Turki, saw in the suppression of the arms trade by the British Government a distinct advantage to himself, since his rebellious subjects were unable to furnish themselves with weapons to use against him, but before his death the discontent which it had caused among the tribes had come to a head. The chief Shaykh of the Ibadhi, to which sect most of the Hinawi tribes belong, roused the country by his preaching, in which he represented the Arms Warehouse as a device of the English to deprive the tribes of Oman of modern weapons, and in May 1913 the Imam of Tanuf, Salim ibn Rashid al Kharusi, rose in revolt. Nizwa, one of the chief towns of Oman proper, fell in June; Izki, immediately to the east of Nizwa, in the following month. After the fall of Izki the rebels, who already had among them as temporal leaders Shaykh Hamyar ibn Nasir and Nabhan, the Tamimah of the Bani Riyarn, were joined by Shaykh Isa ibn Salih, son of the famous Shaykh Salih ibn Ali Al Harithi, who led the great revolt against Saiyid Faisal in 1895. Shaykh Isa, an austere man of strong character, though far from unamenable to bribes, is the leading figure in the confederation. In July L913 the situation became so threatening that the British Government sent a small garrison to Matrah on the coast north of Maskat, but the rebels continued to gain ground, and in August Samail fell into their hands. In September we doubled the garrison at Bait al Falaj, near Maskat. Saiyid Faisal died in October and was succeeded by his son Sayid Taimur who, relying on An old personal friendship with Shaykh Isa, opened negotiations with him, as a result of which Shaykh Isa visited Maskat in December. No permanent result was, however, attained. In April 1914 the rebels were intimidated by the bombardment of Barkah and Qaryat by H.M.S. “ Fox” and H.M.S. “Dartmouth,” but in August fresh hostile movements were set on foot which made it necessary to send reinfjrcements to the garrison at Maskat. In January 1915 the Imam’s followers attacked the British outposts and met with a crushing defeatThe Viceroy visited Maskat in the following month and took the opportunity of recommending the Sultan to come to terms with his rebellious subjects, pointing out that the British garrison would not be maintained indefinitely. He offered the services of the Political Agent as mediator. The latter summed up the difficulties of the situation in the following terms :—- ^ T The rebels held the key of the situation in the possession of Samail valley and fort, which were essential to the commercial prosperity of Maskat. 2. The rising had assumed a religious character, and the Imam was preaching a Jihad. Moreover, so many of the rebels had been killed by our troops in the unsuccessful attack m January that feelings of resentment had been aroused which it would be difficult to allay. 3. The offer of tribal allowances was not likely to prove a strong inducement The Imam might be prevented by religious scruples from accepting an allowance, and the Afol Skt WsTfhe interior. 00 ” 68 ^ ^ ^ the snmf't reductlon °/ the garrison to normal strength would leave the Sultan without within i few\fuJAll of Ma’slaf^ 8 * 7 ’ 8 ^ n0t ’ “ ^ time ’ hv tlPf» rtS Wer8 ’ h0WeVe J &gt; rec ? ived from the interio '- that the rebels were discouraged by the January reverse and anxious to come to terms, the Sultan was glad to accept to thlThV m f d ! a f on of tK ® Political Agent, and m April the latter despatched letters Sal h Vnd V ^ W erS ’ th t Pr- SaKm ibn Rashid al Khasu «.

Any demand implying the contravention of treating rights between Great Britain and the ouican, m which connection wm recognised no one but Saiyid Taimur. 3. Any demand that might injure or hamper our trade. 4. Any demand for tne discontinuance or the existing arms warehouse arrangements. In June letters were received from Humaid al Fulaiti and from the cadi of the Imam., Abdullah Ibn Rashid al Hashimi, the latter unsigned, unsealed, but purporting to represent the views of the Imam. Humaid admitted that he |had had no success with the Imam, and said it was essential that escaped slaves should be returned to their owners, the purchase of arms and ammunition should be allowed, the excess duty levied by the Sultan stopped, and the Ulema administer justice. No law but the Shara would be recognised. The cadi complained :—- 1. Of the stopping of the slave trade and trade which is consonant with the laws of Islam. 2. Of the British claim to command the sea, which is common to all. 3. That the British interfere in the affairs of the Sultans of Oman, and support them in matters contrary to their religion. 4. That the people of Oman are suffering from :— (a.) The fall in the value of the dollar; (b.) The increase in the price of food and cloth. 5. Finally he lodged a general complaint against the British from the standpoint of Islam, for permitting the forbidden, such as the sale of wine and tobacco, and forbidding the permitted, such as the trade in arms and in slaves. It was impossible to take action upon a letter which was not from the Imam himself, and might not represent his views completely, the Political Agent therefore refused to enter further into the negotiations until the Imam himself had acquainted him with his terms. Toward the end of June the Bani Battash, a Hinawi tribe to the south of Maskat, broke into open hostilities. A force of 500 raided and damaged the date gardens of the Wadi Hatat. They were reported to have reached Hajar, six hours from Bait al Falaj, vdiich is the headquarters of the British garrison. The naval contractor, Khan Sahib Nasib Ibn Muhammad, received a letter from them demanding 1,100 dollars as Zakat in respect of his date gardens in Hajar, but was subsequently informed by the Imam’s Wali of Hail that 300 dollars would be sufficient. This sum be paid with Sultan’s knowledge and approval. The latter lost no time in organising a punitive expedition against the Bani Battash, and towards the end of July they submitted to him, and surrendered unconditionally their chief town in the interior, Hail al Ghaf, together with Daghmar, on the coast, where the Sultan proceeded to build a fort. From Qaryat, whence he had conducted the Bani Battash operations, the Sultan went with his successful troops to Sib, but the Imam was in possession of the Samail forts, and the Sultan dared not trust the local tribes, though they had been profuse in protestations of loyalty to him. They ultimately went over to the Imam, but their chiefs were seized and imprisoned by him for having visited the Sultan at Sib. All the tribes were reported to be suffering under the excessive levies oi Zakat, the tax being levied doubly, in the interior by the Imam, on the coast by the Sultan. In July a joint letter was received by the Political Agent from Humaid Fulaiti and the cadi. They reiterated their former grievances, and mentioned as additional [898—9] Hsubjects of complaint the bombardment of Barkah by the “ Fox ” in 1914, and the fact that direct trade between the coast towns and Aden, Karachi, and Bombay was stopped, all vessels being obliged to call at Maskat and pay duty there. ^ In Auo-ust the rebel chiefs communicated with the Political Agent in a letter signed by the Imam, Isa ibn Salih, Hamyar, and the cadi. They requested him# arrano-e for a meeting with the Imam’s representative, Shaykh Isa ibn Salih, near Sib. They added with no little effrontery that the meeting must take place as soon as possible since the Imam had collected a large body of troops for the purpose of attacking the Sultan and could not postpone operations for more than a few days. He had gathered together the heads of the rebellious tribes at Sarur, near Samail, to hear the upshot of the Conference, The projected meeting was approved, and the Political Agent went to Sib on the 10th September in H.M.S. “ Dalhousie,” but news was brought to him by Humwaid al Fulaiti that owing to trouble in the interior Isa ibn Salih would not be able to come to Sib till the 15th September. The excuse seemed to be genuine, the trouble in question was the murder of the Shaykh of the important Hinawi tribe of the Bam Ali, Khalaf ibn Siuan, and the Political Agent consented to return on September 1915. On that date he met Shaykh Isa, his brother, and the cadi of the Imam ; the grievances and demands of the rebels were discussed, and the Political Agent came to the conclusion that, with one or two exceptions, they did not seem to be incapable of adjustment. The main difficulty arose over the Sultan’s demand for the surrender of the Samail forts. Shaykh Isa was at lirst inclined to agree, but he was overcome by the bigotry of the cadi, who declared that the forts could never be surrendered in the Imam’s lifetime, and supported his attitude by references to the Shara. Shaykh Isa gave way, and the demand was unconditionally refused. Since the Conference the rebels have been reported at action in preparation and propaganda. In October 1915 the Imam and Shaykh Isa were said to be in Sharqiyah awaiting the arrival of Shaykh Hemyar to attack Sur. All the local tribes had joined them except the Bani Bu Hasan (Hinawa) and the Jannabah (Ghafiri). The people of Sur were much alarmed, and had sent messages to Saiyid Nadir, the Sultan’s brother, asking for help. In November news reached Maskat that Ali ibn Salih, brother of Shaykh Isa, had fallen out with the latter and was seeking the Sultan’s friendship. Shaykh Isa’s brothers, Ali and Hamad, are mere marauders, much inferior to him in political calibre. The Hahbiyin, a Ghafiri tribe, usually followers of the Sultans of Maskat, were said to be about to attack the British garrison at Bait al Falaj. In June 1916 a further defection from the Sultan took place. Shaykh Nasir ibn Hwmaia, principal fehaykh of Bahlah, was obliged to make peace with the Imam.and to turn out Muzaffir, the Sultans Wall in the coast town of Khaburah, who was with him in the fort at Bahlah. Shaykh Nasir is a man of forcible character, who attained his position about 1885 by^ the murder of his two brothers. He was a protegd of the Sultan, who had paid him a large sum of money and given him, in addition, arms, ammunition, and rice. He was obliged to take refuge at Araqi, on the extreme western limit of Oman, in fear of his life. According to the last reports (July 1916), the Imam is near Nakhl, in the fertile Wadi Ma awal, and is said to intend to make himself master of the whole complex of valleys which passes under that name. The neighbouring Shaykh of Mazahit, near Hustaq had joined him—a defection from the Sultan of 500 to 1,000 men. Towards the end of July, rlamact ibn Ibrahim, a cousin and friend of the Sultan, in more or less independent possession of the forts of Rustaq and Hazam, surrendered to the Imam, borne discussion concerning him had arisen between the Imam and Shaykh Isa, the ormer wis mg to remove him from Hustaq, while the latter was in favour of his being allowed to remain. The incidence of Ramazan has, of course, helped to delay any active revival of the rebellion, but the trend of current reports seems to indicate that Maskat affairs may come into prominence again during the coming winterAPPENDIX (F). Miscellaneous Cuttings from the Press. Egypt: The Port Said Air Raid. As i sit down to v.rite this letter tne two main topics of conversation are the cotton bour« e onsis and the last air raid on Port Said. There is no disguising the fact that ,he latter has come as an unpleasant surprise, and has made a very bad impression. It was certainly thougnt that the defeat of the Turks at Katia and Bir-el-Abd would have meant the cessation of this kind of warfare, and that, even though it had been considered inadvisable for the present to extend our line further east, the air service would have had the situation well in hand, and would have put it out of the power of the enemy any longer to indulge in these little joy-rides. Apparently, although we have unven back the Turks, they are still in possession of strategic points whence they can with impunity raid the Canal. To the ordinary person it would seem that the next sensible plan of action to follow would have been systematically to bomb and destroy all these stations as soon as any attempt was made to make them an aerial pied a^ terre by preference to attacking points in Syria, where it may be true the enemy’s communications are vulnerable, but the destruction of which does not in any way relieve the Canal from the danger which it runs from air raids. Our air service must by tms dme be fully aware of the position of the enemy aerodromes, and it is to be hoped that energetic steps will xorthwith be taken to prevent a recurrence of these incidents, for, as was demonstrated on this last occasion, the danger is not confined to buildings, &amp;c., but extends also to shipping, the destruction of which might well have serious consequences. Apart, however, from the fact that these raids are an upleasant reminder that we are^ still not completely masters in our own territory, there is the local political effect which ought to be taken into account. So long as these raids continue, so long will certain elements of the population persist in believing that the Turks are unbeaten. The manner in which this last raid has followed the recent fighting in the Sinai is regarded as significant by many Egyptians, and as confirming the statement in circulation at the time that the story of our victory was a pure fabrication. With the Oriental, especially the Egyptian, seeing is believing, and, though I am far from being alarmed, yet I will go so far as to say that the air raid on Port Said, on the 1st instant, which was the largest that has taken place so far, has largely counteracted whatever good effect our recent defeat of the Turks had in this country. [The “ Near East,” 15th September, 1916.] The “ Reasonable Programme ” of Italian Nationalism. The “Idea Nazionale” of the 10th September sums up in an editorial leading article what it has set forth in previous articles as Italy’s reasonable claims to territorial compensation in consideration of her voluntary intervention in the war. These may be further summarised as follow T s :— 1. Adjustment of Boundaries of Existing Colonies. Libya .—Inclusion on the west of the caravan route between Ghadames and Ghat; on the east of the oasis of Jarabub. Agreements securing freedom to trade with Borku and Tibesti and free use of the Chad caravan route, fhe Tripolitan would thus recover part of its “ hinterland ” and its former trade, while the possession of the Senussite capital would facilitate the pacification of Cyrenaica. Ethiopia. —Return to the Treaty of Uccialli, which recognised Italy s exclusive right to influence in Ethiopia without the limitations imposed in the hour of misfortune by the triple accord of 1906. Somalia.— -Cession of the valley of the Juba and the northern extremity of British East Africa as far as Lake Rudolf, and the British teomaliland coast and French Somali (regions of small importance to our Allies, and only claimed to the prejudice of Italy in the days of rivalry in Africa). Ti 1 ^ ~ ^ T t • Arabia. —Exclusion of all European influence from the Holy Places of the Rejaz and the recognition—avoiding any form of direct dominion—of Italian influence over Yemen—the necessary complement of Erythrea.These adjustments would merely amount to a “reintegration of what Italy had for the most part obtained less than thirty years ago.” Ihe Government should see to it that no new situation prejudicial to Italy’s reasonable expectations is created during the war. The Egyptian press has repeatedly alluded to the Islet of Kamaran (ofi the^. Yemen coast) as an ancient British possession, whereas it has always been under* Ottoman suzerainty. 2. Direct Acquisitions and Actual Compensations. Italy’s claim, already set forth at length (see “ Daily Review,” 17th August, p. 10; 24th August, p. 9; 2nd September, p. 8) to a share in the partition of Turkey in Asia, which shall include the largest Mediterranean ports and an effective coast connection with the Bagdad Railway. Over and above this programme (set forth in a sketch-map) there are various accords, which might be negotiated with individual States, apart from the peace nego tiations, such as a guarantee for commercial expansion in China, safeguarding of Italian interests in Egypt and Palestine, settlement of the school question in Tunis, connecting up of Massowah with Kassala by a short railway (if it proves necessary after the enlargement of Port Sudan). These demands are modest in comparison with what the Allies possess, and are about to acquire. For Italy they represent a simple rounding-off of existing rights of absolute national necessities. They are based on a fair balance of power. If we were inclined to go in, like our Allies, for a really Imperialistic policy, there are many other claims we might fairly set up in the Far East, in Western and Central Africa. The compensation claimed in the Mediterranean—our most essential aim—is necessary, not only for the sake of balance of power, but to afford a suitable outlet for our emigration, and to provide us with the minerals which Italy lacks, the raw materials for her defence and her industry. The programme represents an absolute minimum—what is absolutely necessary to Italy’s existence as a Great Power. [From the “ Daily Review of the Foreign Press ” (W.O.) of the 15th September.] On the 10th September the “Idea” published a final summary of its various articles on “ Italy’s Plights Overseas.” I .—Rectification of present Colonial Frontiers. (a.) Libya .—From France : the inclusion of the caravan route between Ghadames and Ghat; and agreements securing free passage for trade with Borkum and Tibesti. By this means alone could Tripoli recover part of her age-long trade lost since the war with Turkey. From England: the Oasis of Jarabut would facilitate the pacification of Italy's Mohammedan “ entity,” the Senussi. (b.) Ethiopia and Somaliland .—Ethiopia is exclusively an Italian question, and Italy’s exclusive right of influence there ought again to be recognised without limitations as once provided for in the Treaty of Uccialli. British Somaliland and French Somali ought to be ceded to Italy, together with the Juba Valley and the northern and north-eastern fringes of British East Africa from the coast to Lake Rudolph, in order that Italy may possess unhindered access to Abyssinia. (c.) Arabia’s Holy Places must be freed from all European influences and the Yemen must be granted to Italy. II .—Increase of Empire. (a.) Asia Minor .—The “Idea’s” claims to Turkish territory have already been analysed jn preceding summaries (e.g., 25th August-lst September), and the new r problem for an Italian Asia Minor, as modified by the British occupation of Alexan- dretta, is dealt with above Here Italy’s demands are summarised as : “ a zone which shall comprise the chief ports of the Mediterranean and a real outlet of the Baghdad Railwav.” And (b.) Miscellaneous pretensions (to be negotiated with individual States): commercial expansion in China ; the safeguarding of Italian interests in Palestine ; theM^Xt^t^Kaiak. 11001 QueStl0ri Tunis; fecilities for constructing a railway from Ihe “ Idea ” justifies its case with its usual arguments : are abou^to ^uire^ al ’ e m ° deSt “ ““P™ with what the Allies possess and nntiofiVn Ital ^ they r ®P resent a simple rounding-off of existing rights or absolute national necessities They are based on a fair balance of power If we were other'll •° ln ’ ■ ^ 4 .°^'• ^ llles ’ for a really Imperialistic policy, there are many Africa We ml? alr!j Set Up in the Far East - iQ Western and Centra 3 !

He, having visited the Danube once, regards that notoriously blue river as the cynosure of all eyes. It seems that the object of the war—originally the rescue of small nations and the crushing of militarism—is now to frustrate the Berlin—Bagdad Railway scheme. When I, with my tiresome memory, recall that the said scheme was practically sanctioned to the Germans a few months before the war, I nnd it difficult to regard the taking of it from them as now the prime object for which our youth is offering its glorious life in its millions. I suggest, as an amendment, that the object oi our war is still to dear the Germans out of Belgium and Frayice, not out of Bagdad, which, being a long way off, seems really quite a desirable place to let them go to and lose themselves in.” APPENDIX (G). Letter from Idrisi to the Resident of Aden. From Saiyid Moliamed-bin-Ali-bin-Mohamed-bin-Ahmed-bin-Idris, the Idrisi, to Major-General Stewart, Political Resident, Aden. A.C. We have received your esteemed letter dated 15th Shawal, 1334 (14th August, 1916), and we have understood what your Honour has alluded to, concerning the Comtida affairs. We would like that you should know the inner meaning of the casa, and hope that you have known for certain the pleasure we felt in the action taken by Sherif Husen, the Emir of Mecca, because we regard him as the best of friends, and the old enmity that existed is considered as an incident of the past and as actuated by the Turks. We had a hope that his (Sherif’s) ideas and action would harmonise with ours, as through his medium, co-operation is possible against the enemy, especially when the enemy is powerful and has strong supporters and allies. We long to have all^ the people with us in this matter. Re the question of the port of Comfida, although our claim to it is a substantial one, the temporary surrender of it to the Sherif would not be harmful to us, had the action on his and our part been a joint one, so as to ensure our overcoming the whole district and arranging matters such as the mobilisation of troops. We have more [898—9] Iexperience of this part of the country and are and bad. Those who are afar off and the ^ood are devoted own men. The evilly-disposed people aie in their tavo &gt; ^ ^ hen yom . ships force them to behave properly, but also enlist them as &amp;0 ‘ a o took refuse with their supporters in the near vicinity (as was done five J«»rs ago). they to ■ g the Sherif of Mecca, thus setting up intrigues useful solely to th 0 i.uik • . fc . g not The Sherif will be content that these people have simp } , , -u , r; ] -,, in his power to force them to take further action. Consequently the ^rkswJl gam shelter, and no forces from Mecca to Asm are likely to come. , , , aa p aTe available the people of Asir, who are powerful, will not be affected by s them. they strontlv fortified bills. It is a matter for wonder that such a stratagem should have annealed to the Sherif of Mecca, for he has actually assisted the partisans ol the iutks, :inas ala that the people on whom reliance could be P^-^lbrlurils i have never befriended the Turks, should stop our operations. What is m° r e ™r ous is the support given to him (the Sherif) by British officers m this the ship at Comfida, in order to propitiate the confederates o[ the lurKS m the name of the Sherif, threatened the removal of our people under humiliating terms, uot^it - standing that these were posted at Comfida by Government. The ‘^dship rf these people with us and the Government has resulted in such an tmpasse, and the difficulties arising therefrom may be summarised as follows :— 1 The tribesmen will not hereafter have confidence in us nor in the acts or the British Government. , 2 On the liberation of the Turkish party from our control, they have become powerful and are working in the interest of the Turks As a result they have actually removed the remainder of the soldiers of Comfida, who with their guns and equipments were in open places, to Mohan, which, owing to their fear of us, they could not venture to do before. 3. Our friendlies, on seeing the success of the pro-Turks, will nave an ardent desire to join them. r £ u . 4 The Turks at Abba and Mohail have nothing to fear from any attack of fighting men from Comfida, Tihama (low land), and hills. We had already organised armies from these men in the year when we besieged xvoha. the soldiers who proceeded from us were able to draw them to a fight, because they are natives of the place and are better acquainted with its wa^s. 5. The country of Asir belongs to us, and if we are cut off from it we shall have no supporters left there. . „ G. Our preparations for defence and our preliminary measures made m the event of the Turks’ return are thereby rendered fruitless. 7. The blockade against Abha and its dependencies is removed, because the opening of Comfida for trade is tantamount to allowing goods to leach the interior which is enemy country. 8. All the work done by our posts, such as the interruption of communication between the south and Asir will have been in vain. Had it not been for this, the Sherif of Mecca would have had no success in his present under taking. The Turks had made all necessary preparations at Mecca, hut they were afraid of the day when troubles might arise from the South and Asii, and so they had also made preparations to meet such eventuality. The action was started at Mecca, and our posts intervened between the^ Turks and Sherif. The Sherif, therefore, was able to attain his object through us. Inis is oui explanation of the circumstances. We deem it incumbent on us to withdraw our soldiers from Comfida, and a delegate of ours has been deputed for ^this purpose on Wednesday last, and left in the ship with our mutual friend, Captain Turton. These matters are obnoxious to us, and we feel sorry to see the Sherif of Mecca is pursuing the old policy of the Turks and trusts these hypocritical friends. This is because he never had any fighting against the Turks, and has no experience of theconduct of the tribes in the fight. He placed no reliance on one like ourselves who had experience of the^ same year after year, until he got his independence, which we heartily wish him to attain. J In fact, we consider this the first letter written in our defence. The matters of the ^Jst and future rest with God. As regai ds the question of the gunners which you referred to in your esteemed letter, please note that our tribesmen are not accustomed to visit the ports, and we fear that their behaviour may not be altogether the best. As foi the matter of the dhows, please note that it has become an urgent one owing to the irregularity of the visits of Cowasjee’s steamers, and we therefore request of your praiseworthy benevolence to solve this difficulty. May you be preserved. Dated 21st Shawal, 1334 (20th August, 1916.) Visecret. k .LI 'i- , L_±Ej6 \ DEPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARAB RKPH^Vn [New Seri as. ) ARAB SIIUATTON. ; U' f; factors: ^ pr ° S0nt situat i°n in Hejaz is influenced by two ,1^ the snowfall in the Caucasus. 1 c ? ain S of ' th ® c 03 ! weather in Northern Arabia. The coming into p_a/ of these two factors was anticipated in the appreciations dated 5th June, 19th June and 18th July. ' (}) vKhen the Thrks have dealt a blow at the Grand Duke^m the_ Caucasus, they will probably despatch a coapxe of divisions to the Hejaz aha make short work of the Sheri?. _ Ihis would mean henceforth a Turkish nom inee as Sherif and the final squashing of any hopes of a weakened Turkey or of a non-Ottoman Caliphate and would prepare the way for a real pan-Islamic rising. I am of opinion that if a rising takes place in Hejaz, which the enemy is given leisure to quell in Turco-Teutonic style, the ciiddle East will become a source of greater danger than ever it was before, and a serious drag on operations in the West, The Lahej episode will be repeated on a grand scale, (2) At present it is urgent that the Sherif should be given all possible assistance in munitions, food and money to enable him'to make headway during the hot months of July and August, during which time the Arabs have a greater power of action than the Turks. As regards military operations the Sherif f s position may become critical in September, when the weather improves and a release of Turkish troops in Armenia may be anticipated. (3) Should the railway be liable to interruption between Damascus andMa T an owing to the activities of the Bedawin the Sherif’s position at Mecca will be fair ly secure; but should the Turks establish easy access to Medina, the situation to the south will be precarious.* It was not then foreseen that the participation of Roumania would call away a large number of troops from Turkey- in-Asia, and the forecasts quoted are modified by this fresh factor. However the main point which has to be taken into consideration is that if the Turks can maintain effective Railway communication between Medina and Damascus or even be tween Medina and Dera’a, collect sufficient transport at Medina, and there organise a mobile force with a fighting head H ■;head of 7,000 men supported by artillery and aerial recon- unissfstei? the ^ rab8 cannot withstand them permanently if unassisted. the consequences of the retaking of Mecca ^T^K he as b ^if M^cffalls alter «r« Pilgrimage as if it fell before.

THE SHERIF OF MECCA. The Sherif s Operations. On the 13th September Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 778] that Colonel Wilson had arrived oh the previous day and that after discussing the situation with him with the G.O.C.I.C., and with the naval C.I.C. he had. addressed a memorandum to tiie G.O.C.I.C. the terms of which he telegraphed. The situation in Hejaz, he said, had reached a point which demanded an immediate decision. Ali Haidar, who had been appointed Sherif by the Turks, had reached Medina with the Holy Carpet, and the Turks were determined to try to break through to Mecca, along the Sultaneh road, by way of Rabegh, in time for the pilgrimage. Whilst Faisal was opposing them on that road, Ali was operating on their left flank and rear. The former told Colonel Wilson that his forces were beginning to doubt the reality of British support, and if they did not receive the moral backing of trained troops at Rabegh they would lose heart and give way to a really determined advance on that place ; and in it the Sherif has large quantities of supplies and munitions of war on which the Turks reckon for 'their advance to Mecca. On the other hand, Faisal maintains, and Colonel Wilson agrees with him, that the presence of trained troops at Rabegh would so hearten his Arabs that he and Ali would be able to hold up the Turkish force and sever their communication with Medina. If the Turks should succeed the pilgrimage would be seriously endangered, and the whole Arab movement would run grave risk of collapse. The retaking of Mecca would gravely damage our prestige throughout the Moslem world ; would open the whole of Arabia to the Turks; and would give them free access to the Eastern shores of the Red Sea. The situation in Somaliland and Abyssinia would be seriously affected; and the whole political and military situation east of Suez would be jeopardised. Recent information proves that the Turkish aim was expansion down and across the Red Sea; this was barred by the Arab revolt, and it is essential that this bander should be maintained. More than this, in case of the Sherif s failure, we should certainly be held largely responsible, for we are morally bound to support him. Sir H. McMahon fully appreciates the objections to landing British troops in Hejaz, and the use which would be made of such action by hostile propagandists, especially in India ; but His Majesty’s Government must now decide whether this would not be preferable to a total collapse of the Arab movement, which has the sympathy, if not the actual support, of the majority of Arab peoples. _ Sir H. McMahon is of opinion, after very careful consideration, that an offer should be made to the Sherif to send an infantry brigade to Rabegh, and that, if the offer is [898—8] yA \ \accepted, the troops should be sent without delay. He therefore asked that, subject to the approval of the consul, a brigade ol infantry, two batteries of artillery, a company of eno-ineers, a field ambulance, and half the Sirdar’s aeroplanes should be held in readiness to proceed to Rabegh at the earliest possible date. If available, Moslem troops would be preferable, though this is of less importance, as European officers ancj^ mechanic troops would be necessary for any such force. . Sir H. McMahon says that he knows that if we do not send the troops the French Government is ready to offer to send Moslem troops to Hejaz. He greatly deprecates this, as it would rob us of the very great political advantages which the Sherif s success will give us. Moreover, in his opinion, the French troops could hardly reach Hejaz in time to be of use. He then said that since writing the above the Sherif had telegraphed to him urgently asking for three battalions. In conclusion, he asked the G.O.C.I.C. to submit the question to the War Office, with such observations as he might see fit to make. Sir H. McMahon further said that there was every hope that the Arabs would, by their own efforts, attain the desired success, but it seemed to be imperatively necessary to provide moral support to ensure this. As to French troops being sent, he greatly doubted whether they would be in time to be of use ; but in any case such assistance would entail many inconvenient consequences. To this the Foreign Office replied, on the 14th September [No. 744], that the War Committee had, on the 2nd September, considered the proposal to send Sudanese troops to Hejaz, and were decidedly of opinion that British troops could not be spared from Egypt to replace them. This would equally apply to sending British troops to Hejaz. No hopes of overcoming the objections of the military authorities could be held out, and, that being so, we must facilitate any assistance which the French may be able to send. Help for the Sherif. On the 7th September the French Ambassador informed the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that his Government was willing to help the Sherif, and that Colonel Bremond had precise instructions to come to an understanding with the British authorities in Cairo in regard to this matter, and to give all possible help to the new Government without interfering in any way either with the administration of the country, the complete independence of which the English and French Governments are, by their recent agreements, mutually pledged to respect, or with questions which concern the political status of the Red Sea littoral. [F.O. 178,497.] On the 12th September the Admiralty informed the Foreign Office that it concurred in informing the Sherif that His Majesty’s Government was prepared “ to afford him such naval support as may be practicable in the Red Sea or Gulf of Akaba, with due regard to other operations.” | F.O. 181,689.] This was telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon on the 14th September [No. 737]. French Mission to the Sherif, Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 15th September [No. 785] that he had been informed by the French Minister that the Civil and Military Mission would leave Suez on the 17th September for Jeddah, whence the Moslem members would proceed to Mecca. He added that Colonel Bremond and the other French officers appeared to be intending to remain at Jeddah for a considerable time. New Turkish Force for Hejaz. An agent reported on the 14th September that a force of 9,000 men was being sent against the Sherif, under the command of Fuad Pasha. He said that the lines of communication were very bad, and that the expedition need not be seriously feared. IBN SAUD. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 13th September [No. 779], with reference to the telegram of the 8th September from Basra to the Secretary of State for India, that there was nothing in the negotiations between [group omitted] and the Sherif which was incompatible with [? our] undertakings in regard to Ibn Saud, and in consequencethat there seemed to be no obstacle to the proposed communication to Ibn Saud f? norl to communicate [group omitted] of the Nejd treaty to the Sherif. - he C.P.O. at Basra telegraphed on the 13th September I I.O. : P. 3745] that the Political Agent at Koweyt had reported that Fahad Beg and Nuri Shalaan las to the letter see “ Arabian Beport,” N.S-VI, 1] had been corresponding with Kerbela and ^ e]e , and had already joined the Sherif, but that the Anazeh were waiting for a signal from Ibn Saud ; if he would move, the rest of Arabia would follow. He also said that news had come from Kiadh that a brother of the Sherif had come to persuade Ibn Saud to help, but that t he latter was reported to be hesitating and unwilling. [See “ Arabian Report,” N.S. IX, p. 2.] Further, that it w 7 as reported that Ibn Saud had written to the Turkish Government and was awaiting a reply. In regard to this, the C.P.O. at Basra says that it very likely refers to Ibn Saud’s letter to himself, remarking that news from Koweit relating to Ibn Saud is liable to be unfriendly. MOHAMMERAH. The C.P.O. at Basra reports that the Shaykh of Mohammerah has written a latter of congratulation to the Sherif on his efforts for the Arab race. KOWEYT AND THE TRUCIAL COAST. The C.P.O. at Basra reports that the Shaykh of Koweit has written to the Sherit in the same terms as the Shaykh of Mohammerah. MASK AT. [Nil.] BAHREIN. [Nil.] PAKT II. POLITICAL NOTES FROM THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. The Caucasus. An official report was issued in Petrograd on the 14th September, to the effect that in the Kyghi region the Kurds, who are hostile to Russia, were displaying considerable activity. [“Morning Post,” 15th September (Reuter).] And on the following day another official communique stated that on the Russian positions, in the coastal region of Gumishkhaneh, snow had fallen in places to a depth of over 2 feet [“Times, 16th September (Reuter).] Northern Mesopotamia. The C.P.O. at Basra sends a note of information given by Nahya al Yahya, an Arab of Mosul, on the 11th August, 1916. Miss Gertrude Bell, the writer of the note, says that he is a man very well known in the desert. He has a special medicine or ointment,^ ■which they call Hadid, for the curing of mange in camels. Miss Bell has often heaid of him, with much vaunting of his skill. He has a son with Ibn Saud, and another with Ibn Sabah. Nahya al Yahya left Mosul three months ago and travelled by laknt to Ramadi on the Tigris, and then by the desert near Shithathah to Shaqrah, where he found Ibn Rashid and treated his camels. iiaia- The northern Shammar, the Jerba, are wholly out of hand. Ihe old Shaykh Al Asi is still alive, about 65—70. His son Zaid is the most notable figure among them. They take blackmail from Mosul to Baghdad, and from Mosul most of the way to Aleppo. They have been raiding the Anazeh this year Sba £ and Fadan. No soldiers along the Mosul-Baghdad road, and you scarcely ever see a gendarme.4 ■ipp^Pip! The Jebel Sin jar is quite independent—no Turkish officials or soldiers at Balad Sinjar. The carriage road from Dair to Mosul via Sinjar is impossible by reason of Yazidi raids. Mahmud al Bajwal rules over the northern part of the Jebel Sinjar, Khalil Qasim al Ghiran over the southern part, and Mata is the Shaykh of Samugah in f the plain. The Yazidis are friends with the Shammar, but foes with the Anazeh. . When we marched on Ctesiphon, the Turks summoned Shammar and Anazeh to help them, but not a man came from either tribe. If we got to Baghdad, Nahya is of opinion that they would all join us. Of the Dulaim, Nijris ibn Qu’ud, paramount chief of the Al bu Nlmr, and the Al bu ‘Ubaid, is the leader of the c^mel owners, while £ Ali Sulaiman is the leader of the fellahin. The latter is the richer in goods, but Ibn Yu ud is the more powerful in fighting men and arms. He is said to have 6,000 men. This summer Abu Tayy (Huwaitat) raided the Sha’ up to near Aleppo and took 80 ra’iyahs of camels (a ra’Iyah is 80 to 100 camels). Nahya is ready to take letters to Fahad Beg and to ‘Ali Sulaiman when he comes back from Koweyt. The ambassador at Madrid has forwarded a letter received by him from Habib Lotfallah Bey, “ex-president de la Defense nationale en Syrie,” now residing in Madrid, for transmission to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [F.O. 179,473]. The writer suggests that the Syrians in Bgypt should be allowed to organise themselves, forming a republic or principality, and march against the Turks in Syria. Further, that Michel Bey Lotfallah, now residing in Egypt, should be invited to England and given an interview; he is the son of H. Lotfallah Pasha, was born at Cairo in 1880, and was nominated a member of the Egyptian Legislative Council by Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, when High Commissioner, to officially represent the Syrians. The £&lt; Moustakbal ” reports from a reliable source that the Turkish Government has entrusted the defence of the Eastern Mediterranean coast from Haifa to Gaza to certain Arab chiefs who are at the head of armed groups of Arabs from Karak, Nablous, Acca, and Djenin. These chiefs were lately decorated by Djemal Pasha, who bestowed upon them the title of Shaykh-al-Mujorhidin. The same paper states confidently that the regular Turkish army in Syria did not exceed 14,000 men at the beginning of August. About two-thirds of these were lost in killed, wounded, prisoners, and deserters during the last attack in the Canal zone. Aden. * Situation unchanged. PABT III. MISCELLANEOUS.

No. 740o Shereef has made urgent demands for full-equipment for a force of 40,000 men of which following are most important items.

Five machine gune are on the way from England and Military Authorities here have supplied the rifles. I have consulted Sir Archibald I,array who is not able to supply the Q.F. Batteries or Aeroplanes with limited resources at command. I therefore urge most strongly that War Office is approached with a view to cope v/ith despatch, complete in every detail except personel. Batteries should be supplied with ammunition in proportion of three quarters shrapnel and one quarter common shell.

Sent to India and Sirdar 740,SECRET. f p 3772 1916 j APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARAB REPORT No. IX (New Series). THE immediate local situation in IJejaz has apparently improved. Colonel Wilson, whose prognostics have hitherto proved very accurate, evidently anticipates the probability of a successful pilgrimage, while Shaykh Hussein, of Rabegh, who may be relied upon to take no steps contrary to his personal interests, has seen fit to swear allegiance to the Sherif. These symptoms should indicate at least a temporary immobility of the Turkish forces at Medina. If the pilgrimage is carried through without a hitch a very great advantage will be gained both by Great Britain and France, and Turco-German prestige will suffer a considerable eclipse. The comments of Ibn Saud on the Sherif and the attitude he adopts are reminiscent of our late affair with Idris at Comfidah. Arab notables always endeavour to play off one Government against another and to get themselves regarded as the local favourite. Our task is somewhat difficult as our business is to draw the Arabs together rather than to play them off one against the other. The Arab chiefs are prone to disunion by nature and perceiving that our political control is not outwardly united under one hand, probably jump to the absurd conclusion that British, like Turkish, officials can be induced to vie with one another in backing local celebrities. However, as there is now complete co-operation and cordial sympathy between Egypt and India it should be possible to overcome this tendency; though it might be suggested that in future all the various departments and officials directly and indirectly concerned in Arabian affairs should be acquainted with the proposed texts of treaties which local officers may have to make with chieftains and others. The French contribution to the Sherif s armament should be of considerable value to him ; it is regrettable that we should have been unable to find the armament and instructors ourselves, as we shall naturally suffer in prestige. It is to be hoped that Indian officers will be able to be spared, as was suggested in the last report. As regards Indian Moslems special attention is drawn to the letter by Siraj-ud-Din Ahmed. This letter is very remarkable as showing a knowledge of Moslem history and an understanding of the actual situation in Arabia rare in Indian writers. The author is not only on the Arab side in the matter, but apart from this he speaks the plain unvarnished truth with a directness and simplicity which shows the special pleading of the Indian Turco-phil seditionists to be as ridiculous as it is dishonest. It is to be hoped that patriotic and conscientious writers, who have the courage of their convictions like Siraj-ud-Din Ahmed, will receive the encouragement they deserve. An appreciation of the Sherifs proclamation by Siraj-ud-Din would be very valuable. Before closing, attention is drawn to two events which may, within the next three months, have a very important influence on the general Arabian situation. I he first is the commencement of the snowfall in Armenia, announced in the Russian communique; the second the presence of Enver at the Imperial War Council taking place at the German headquarters. . . ' The snowfall heralds the commencement of the period when we may anticipate the release of Ottoman troops from the Caucasian front; the presence of Enver at the War [898—7] ■v£ seH^d NAL msail £ 2 f, Council indicates that some decision will be come to in regard to the campaign in Hejaz It is to be noted that the release of troops coincides with the commencement of the cooler season in Arabia. e&gt; :• Pr'rnV-, M. S. P.S. (3 p.m.). —Since going to press a telegram, dated the 12th September, has been received from Cairo saying that Faisal had stated that the Mahmal had arrived at Medina, and that the Turks were determined to try and break through. Colonel Wilson was to have reached Egypt on the 12th September to report on the situation. From Basra news had come that Ibn Rashid had left Hail with the intention of attacking the northern Harb, who are helping the Sherif. It is plain the Turks will try their best to break south if an opportunity offers. The importance of frustrating this until the pilgrimage is over grows as time goes on.- —; /•.- SECRET. r f 3772 i9!6 For Refereince only. 22 ARABIAN REPORT. N.S. No. IX. September 13, 1916 (night).

On the 9th September he telegraphed [No. 769] that Colonel Wilson had that day reported that the situation was entirely satisfactory : Shaykh Hussein and his followers had sworn allegiance to the Sherif. Colonel VV ilson was proceeding to Yambo. The Haj. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 9th September [No. 769] that Colonel Wilson had expressed the opinion that the pilgrimage should not be stopped. Among some notes “ compiled from letters received from Albanian friends now in Switzerland,” furnished by the Foreign Office, the following^ passage occurs in regard to the Committee of Union and Progress : 44 They are terrified at the idea that the approaching pilgrimage may be attended only by subjects of the Entente Powers under the auspices of the Gfrand Sherif, without iurkish participation or mention of the Caliphate of Constantinople. They recognise that this would be a death blow to their prestige, and would do almost anything to avoid it.” / ■ . . French Mission to the Sherif. Lord Bertie telegraphed on the 5th September [No. 923] that Lord Granville had been informed by M. Gout that one of the Algerians in the mission to the Sherif was a fully trained officer of the French artillery, and had been at the front in command of a battery. The French hoped that he might be kept by the Sherif as a permanent organiser and instructor. [898—7] B2 In a despatch dated the 29th August [F.O. 177828], Mr. White, agent at Tangier, said that he had been informed by his French colleague that the Algerian and Tunisian delegation would be headed by Sid ben Ghabrit, an Algerian employed at the residency, who before the establishment of the protectorate was interpreter at the French Legation. Mr. White also said that at first there was some question of sending Moors with tire deputation, but that General Lyautey disapproved, on the ground that it would e likely to give rise to dissatisfaction in Morocco, as the Moors had never recognised one caliphate of the Sultan of Turkey, and regarded their own Sultan as the “ Emir el Mumenin ” or Prince of the True Believers. French Help for the Sherif. The Army Council has informed the Foreign Office that it has learnt from the French military attache that his Government is prepared to furnish substantial military assistance for the Sherif of Mecca on hearing from him that their offer meets with the approval of the British military authorities. The proposed assistance comprises the personnel, equipment, and ammunition for a field battery, a mountain battery, and eight machine gun sections. It also includes a company of engineers, the personnel of a railway and telegraph section, and sufficient officers to enable the Sherif to organise locally two infantry battalions and four squadrons of cavalry The personnel is in all cases to the Mussulman. In view of the importance of rendering early assistance to the Sherif in the matter of guns, machine guns, and technical personnel, the Council recommend that the French Government be invited to proceed at once with the training and despatch of the units specified above, provided that Viscount Grey of Fallodon considers that no political difficulties would result therefrom. Opinion in Somaliland. The following is taken from a letter [C.O. 172,763] on the political situation in the western area of the Somaliland Protectorate sent to the Colonial Office by the Commissioner, Mr. G. F. Archer, C.M.G. : “ The news of events at Mecca has met with a most favourable reception here, and I am confident that a profound impression will be made upon the Somali mind on the publication, in due course, of the Grand Sherifs proclamation which, as you informed me .... is being forwarded direct to me from Khartoum.” IBN SAUD. In a telegram, dated the 5th September, from the Arab Bureau, Basra, to D.M.I., it was stated that the C.P.O. had received a long letter from I bn Saud, dated the 25th July. In regard to his not having moved againsr, Ibn Bashid, he explained that his expedition against the Almurrah was necessary in our joint interests, as otherwise they would have joined Ibn Bashid. He w~as glad to hear of the Sherif’s action, as in any case it meant a severe blow to the Turks and, it might be, their expulsion from Arabia. He went on, however, to remark that the wording of the official communique caused him some uneasiness, as there had been a feud between him and the Sherif for years. He and his tribesmen had always opposed the Sherif s interference and would never tolerate any control on his part or interference with their well recognised and defined boundaries. Fie expressed the belief that the Sherif s original intention was to play off the British against the Turks, and so to get the Turks to grant him inde pendence guaranteed by Germany. He advised us to give the Sherif just enough assistance to ensure the protraction of the struggle between him and the Turks, so as to keep them employed and unable to detach troops to Mesopotamia. On the 8th September the Arab Bureau, Basra, telegraphed [No. 4523] to Cairo that another letter had been received from Ibn Saud stating that he had received a letter from the Sherif asking for alliance and assistance ; to this he had replied that in regard to assistance he would do his best, but as to alliance he had reminded the Sherif of the latter’s habitual endeavour to interfere with his tribes and territory. If the Sherif was now sincere in his request for an alliance, he should solemnly undertake to refrain from such interference. In regard to this letter Ibn Saud informed the C.P.O. that he had no personal wish for an alliance with the Sherif, and had entertained the proposal because we desired it and because he hoped for the expulsion of the Turks. Should the replyit el suggest that the Sherifs intention was to deeeire him and to seek to exercise control over him, Ibn Saud would take steps to protect his own interests: unless his relations with the^ bhenf were a matter which concerned us, in which case he would be guided reply 11 * W1SheS ' In any CaSe he WOuld refer to Sir P - Cox a g ain on getting the Sherifs ^ at Co J rimentin g on Sir Percy Cox refers to the Sherifs letter of the 5th November, and the_ High Commissioners reply of the 13th December, 1915. The lattei, he says, specifically assumed that the recognition of our treaties with Arab chiefs by the Sherif applied to “ all territories included in the Arab Kingdom.” Sir Percy Cox earnestly hopes and understands that “ we have decided to regard this lattei [conupt gioup] as defunct as far as we are concerned,” but asks whether it can be assumed with safety that it is also dead in the mind of the Sherif. In any case he thinks that Ibn Saud should be definitely informed that no undertakings, present or future, between us and the Sherif will prejudice our adherence to the terms of the first two articles of the treaty of the 26th December, 1915, and that it is highly important that he should unite with the Sherif “in championing the common cause of the chiefs and tribes of Arabia, the emancipation of whom is one of the chief features of British policy.” He adds that it is a matter for consideration as to whether the terms of the treaty with Ibn Saud should not be communicated to the Sherif. [The two articles of the treaty referred to by the C.P.O. are the following :— “ (1.) The British Government do acknowledge and admit that Najd, A1 Hasa, Qatif, and Jubail, and their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and determined hereafter, and their ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf, are the countries of Ibn Saud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Ibn Saud as the independent Buler thereof and absolute Chief of their tribes, and after him his sons and descendants by inheritance; but the selection of the individual shall be in accordance with the nomination (i.e., by the living Buler) of his successor; but with the proviso that he shall not be a person antagonistic to the British Government in any respect; such as, for example, in regard to the terms mentioned in this treaty. “ (2.) In the event of aggression by any Foreign Power on the territories of the countries of the said Ibn ISaud and his descendants, without reference to the British Government and without giving her an opportunity of communicating with Ibn Saud and composing the matter, the British Government will aid Ibn Saud to such an extent and in such a manner as the British Government, after consulting Ibn Saud, may consider most effective for protecting his interests and countries.”] IBN BASHID. An agent reported [07465] on the 1st September that the Young Turks had made an agreement with Ibn Bashid to attack the Sherif of Mecca simultaneously. MASKAT.

The two Arab officers who were offered to us by the Grand Duke Nicholas [see “ Arabian Report,” N.S., VI, p. 5], and accepted by the D.M.L, are now on their way to England, and should arrive in the course of the next few days. On Thursday, the 7th September General Dessino, of the Russian General Staff, now attached to the War Office, expressed a desire to the D.M.O. that he should be fully informed as to the general situation in Arabia, and its influence on the Russian field of operations in Armenia and Kurdistan. A memorandum, with a map, was accordingly prepared by the secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence, giving the actual political situation in the regions chiefly inhabited by Arabs, and this was handed to General Dessino on the 11th September. The papers report that snow has begun to fall in the mountains about Erzerum. Aden. Situation unchanged. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. Turkish Propaganda in Abyssinia. Mr. J. H. Dodds, consul at Harran, reported [C.O. 176292] that on the 19th July a three-paged address in Arabic was exposed to view outside a Turk’s shop in that place. In this it was stated that we had bought the Sherif and the Bedawin, and that with their help we meant to crush Islam ; that we meant to use Mecca and Medina as a meeting-place for men and women, and that immorality would be facilitated ; and that the Earl of Cromer had referred to the Koran as a damned book. It also contained an exhortation of a Jehad against us—-there was no mention of the Allies. The consul was not allowed by the Governor to take a copy ; but the verbal report of his Somali interpreter was confirmed by others. The Turkish agent told the chief of police that it had been published by order of the Turkish consul. A French-Ai'menian Corps. The French Government proposes to raise a corps of Armenians, and Cyprus has been selected for their place of training [C.O. 180004]. Moslems in Java. The consul-general at Batavia telegraphed to the effect that the majority of the Arabs in his district (all of whom come from Hadramut), and especially the Said section, desire evidence of British sympathy. They suggest that one way of showing this effectively would be to establish a post and telegraph office at Makalla, so that they could solidify relations and remit money to their friends there. The Secretary of Stale for India repeated this to the Viceroy on the 11th September [P. 3608], and asked for his views, adding that, from letters from the Resident at Aden earlier in the year, it appeared that the influence of the Java Moslems might be hostile to the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. Enemy War Council. News from Amsterdam and Zurich, that the most important war council ever held by the Central Powers is now in progress, is published in the “ Evening Standard ” of this date (13th September). It is under the presidency of the German Emperor, and among those present are the King of Bulgaria, the Archduke Charles, Enver Pasha, and the German Chancellor.5 APPENDIX (A.) i Revolution in Arabia. Claims and Conduct of the Turks. (From the “ Times of India.”) SIRAJUDDIN AHMED, Bar.-at-Law.—A few weeks ago I published a pamphlet, “ Haqiqat-i-Khilafat ” (the truth about the Khilafat), in which I put together a few articles' written by the late Sir Syed Ahmad Khan in 1897, on that subject of vast importance to the Muslim world—the claims to the Khilafat. I had added to these articles some fifty pages of explanatory notes, in which, besides presenting a brief review of the subject matter of the articles, I discussed the political situation at that time and its bearing on the subject. At the time of publishing my pamphlet I had no idea that events in Arabia, which are, however, in no way unexpected, would in the very near future bring the question of the so-called Khilafat into prominence. The effect upon the minds of the Musalmans of India, of the news that the Sharif of Mecca had announced his independence, may be embodied in a few words. The illiterate Muslim public showed complete ignorance of and indifference to the significance of the news, while the majority of the educated Musalmans, although they kept an open mind on the matter, failed to analyse the real nature of the revolution. Both parties, however, are perfectly satisfied when the cause and effects of the event are placed before them in a true light. Some of the enlightened Musalmans have given expressions to their satisfaction at the event, and their feeling is that this uprising in Arabia will solve for all time the vexed question of the Khilafat. A protest has, however, been raised by one of the Maulvies of Lucknow, who seemingly has failed to grasp the true significance of the Arabian revolution, which, in his opinion, has greatly perturbed the minds of the Muslim community in India. Following him, a few Muslims of Lucknow have raised their voices in condemnation of the Arabs as rebels and enemies of Islam, and have passed a resolution to the effect that the Arab revolt endangers the sanctity and safety of the sacred places of Islam. Let us examine the sentiments of our sensitive brethren of Lucknow and their resolution. Do they really mean to assert that the Arabs are enemies ot Islain because they have renounced their allegiance, such as it was, to the Turks, who have lent our sacred religion to Germany to be one of its weapons wherewith to gain an infamous supremacy in the world ? Are the Arabs guilty because they refuse to be identi e with a nation who side with our Empire’s enemies and tacitly concur in their inhumanity and utter depravity ? •, i ^ u-i- n If the Arabs are enemies of Islam because they have endangered the sanctity and safety of our Holy Places, let us see how far the accusation is true. As regards the sanctity of Mecca and Medina, it is difficult to imagine how it can be endangered If these Holy Places derived their sanctity from being under the domination of Dir key, then, with the elimination of Turkish control, undoubtedly their sanctity would disappear But if they derive their sacredness from their connection with Abraham, the first and with Muhammad, the last and greatest of the prophets, then their sanctity will remain undiminished. In the past, attempts were made to desecrate the_ sacred places of Islam. For instance, Yazid, son of Muaw va turned the Masjid of the Prophet into a stable, levelled the sacred tombs and pulled down the Kaaba Yet in the minds of all true believers those places still reipain as sacred as before, and will remain so despite the condemnation of the Arabs by certain misguided and biassed Musalmans who seem to overlook that the Sharif of Mecca is the direct descendant of the Prophet, and that the Arabs are his kith and kin. # # tv/t i So far as the safety of the sacred places in Arabia is concerned every Musalman has only to remember that God himself has provided for this. He has ordained that Mecca and Medina should be situated in a country containing not mg w o tempt the ruthless invader. It is a country barren and inhospitable with not a mg, of mineral wealth or any other worldly attraction. If m the distant past this part of Arabia was ever invaded, it was for the purpose only of chastising i s U ; | times its possession has been sought by Muslim ruling dynasties, so that obtain thereby the privileges of the so-called Khilafat and thus be a o e o wi . privileges for their temporal advantage. [898—7] C- The Arabs have been styled the enemies of Islam because they have freed them selves from the Turkish domination, but is it not more correct to say that Turkey has practically by her own conduct compelled the Arabs to disconnect their country from Turkey ? We need not discuss whether Turkey before the war was capable of defending the safety of the Holy Places, although the Musalmans of Lucknow would not have sucP~ , bad memory as to forget the threatened bombardment of Jedda and Yembo by i.lo Italians during their invasion of Tripoly and the intervention of Great Britain to stop them from the sacrilege of the Holy Land. But after Turkey joined in the Great War, to whom did they entrust the safety of the Holy Places ? There is no difficulty in answering this question if events leading to the participation of Turkey in the war are scrutinised. The Turkish military party led by Anwar Pasha compelled Turkey, against the inclinations of the Sultan, the Prime Minister, the Sheikh-ul-Islam, several other Ministers, and the Heir-Apparent to the Turkish Throne, to join Germany. The Turkish Heir-Apparent, who was the ablest statesman in the country, was subsequently murdered because of his peaceful and moderate policy. When Turkey was precipitated into the war, she withdrew from Arabia the heavy garrison which she had been compelled to keep there for the purpose of overawing the Arabs, and left the Arabs practically free to do as they listed. It is a well-known fact that the Arabs have never been conciliatory to the Turkish domination, and the Turks never succeeded in gaining their confidence. During the 400 years of the Turkish control of the Hedjaz, the Arabs have never missed the opportunity of struggling against and throwing away the Turkish yoke whenever one presented itself. Turkey, therefore, by weakening her military strength in that part, virtually invited the present revolution in Arabia. It is a question now whether the Turkish military party, who are the real rulers of Turkey, will desire to recover the Hedjaz, and whether it will have sufficient value at all in their estimation to make it worthy of recovery and retention. It is generally known that Turkey never derived any material benefit whatever from their dominion over Hedjaz. In fact, the nominal possession of that country annually cost Turkey crores of rupees in bribes and otherwise. This heavy expenditure was-borne by the Turks, either that they might reap the fruits of it in the world to come, or that they would be compensated in this world by purchasing the sympathies and aid of every Muslim community in their hour of need. In this latter expectation they have been utterly disappointed. Germany hoped and Turkey believed that, when the call was sounded from the so-called Khilafat, every Musalman would rise to help the Turks. But ^ the Muslims outside Turkey were neither so foolish nor so ignorant of their religious duties as to allow themselves to be led away by the Turkish military party and German intriguers. Of the two conjectured objects of Turkish expenditure in the Hedjaz, there only remains the hope of spiritual reward, and it is to be seen whether or not Turkey is willing to spend her money as before for that purpose. those people, who are pleased to call the Arabs rebels, perhaps are unaware that the lurks have never claimed to be the rulers of the Holy Land, nor have they ever treated the inhabitants of those parts as subjects, and the Arabs would, in fact, never have borne such treatment. The Sultans of Turkey have always taken pride in calling themselves the servants of sacred Mecca and holy Medina. No taxes were ever levied on those cities, but, on the other hand, enormous sums, as we have already stated, were paid out from the Turkish Treasury as salaries, stipends, presents, &amp;c. The government of the Hedjaz and the holy cities was entirely in the hands of the Sharif, who was paid 12,00,000 karash per annum as a subsidy. The Turkish representative, called wall, has always been liable to transfer if he incurred the displeasure of the Sharif According to M. Mahboob Alam, no less than ten to twelve walies were transferred in a period of two years, because they did not please the Sharif Therefore it would be absurd to call the Sharif a rebel, although it may be said that the Sharif has not acted wisely in asserting his independence, and thus deprived himself and many others of monetary advantages which they received from the Turks. But the Sharif s answer to this is that whatever he has done, has been for the purpose of upholding the sanctity of the holy cities, and for protecting and saving them from those dangers which the Turks had created. Previous to the war Turkey had no enemies amongst the big Powers and the Turkish dominions were safe. But when Turkey joined in the war, the Arab opinion must necessarily have been that any part of the Turkish dominions was liable to be invaded by her enemies, and this view must have been strengthened by the invasions of Gallipoli, Armenia, and Mesopotamia. It is known that when Anwar Pasha visited7 Mecca, some time ago, the Sharif told him: “You are an ignorant person, and you are dragging Turkey downwards to its ruination.” The Sharif has therefore achieved the separation of Hedjaz from Turkey, so as to remove it from any danger of a hostile action and being included in the ruin of Turkey. The Sharif, in declaring the independence of the Hedjaz, has acted for the best in the light of his own understanding, and, if his act can be attributed to a good motive, no one has a right to use strong language in condemnation of it. Apart from the question as to whether Turkey or the Arabs have the power to protect the Hedjaz, the whole world knows, and the Muslim gentlemen of Lucknow, who, like good Musalmans, are feeling anxiety for the safety of the holy cities, must also know, that our sacred land is being protected by the greatest Muslim Power in the world, for the sake of her eighty million Musalman subjects, or, in other words, the eight crore Muslim subjects of the British Empire are responsible for the safety of the Hedjaz. It is to be hoped that Musalmans have not degenerated to the extent, and lost their sense of fairness, that they are unable to feel grateful to those who have acted in a noble spirit towards them, and have done good to them. It is neither loyal nor honest to increase the difficulties of the Government at the present time by publishing false views, and thereby misleading the Musalman public. It does not require any deep thinking to come to the conclusion that it is abject disloyalty to sympathise with Turkey, even under any cloak, as long as she is fighting against our Empire, and it is disloyalty all the same to condemn Arabs, under any excuse, who are in their present position the enemies of our enemies, and therefore our friends.SECRET. APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARAB REPORT No. VIII (New Series). . THE Sherif’s position still gives cause for anxiety. The Turks maybe relied upon to make every effort to get into a position to prevent the pilgrimage taking place. Attention is drawn to Sir H. McMahon’s request for the assistance of selected Indian officers from the Indian force now in France. I, It is suggested in regard to propaganda in Mesopotamia that General Clayton should be given sufficient funds to enable the Arab Bureau to produce the fortnightly literary supplement for the “ Haqiqat.” . v The letter from the Resident at Aden to the Secretary of the Political Department of the Government of Bombay is interesting: it would have been more interesting a month ago. Examination of the Iraq Code shows that the Shara’, or Ecclesiastical Courts, have been abolished, and that in Ecclesiastical cases, though a reference is made to a Mohammedan Jurist, the judgment is given by the British Court [see section 41 (p. 16)]. There is no objection to this as a provisional arrangement in occupied territory under military administration, where the population is mostly Shia, but such a S 3 T stem cannot be extended to Sunni areas without giving rise to considerable trouble and discontent. In Appendix (A) will be found a history of Sayyid Talib, which is of special interest. Sayyid Talib was an able, ambitious, and powerful leader. He practically gave life to the Arab movement after the Young Turk revolution, and managed by various means to maintain a very strong hold over the Basra province, although almost always in opposition to the Government. In May 1914 he was at the zenith of his power, and was playing for the rulership of Southern Mesopotamia under Turkish suzerainty. In October of the same year, when we appeared on the scene, he retired “ voluntarily ” to India. The note m the appendix does not mention the fact that from November 1915 to March 1916 Sayyid Talib was engaged in correspondence with the Government of India, begging permission, on grounds of health, to move from the place chosen foi his retirement. His request was granted after it had been under discussion for four months. ' We have been unable to make any use of this remarkable if unscrupulous man, because we have hitherto not had any general defined policy in regard to the Arab movement. . ^ „ , „ . . , rf, In Appendix (C) is reprinted an article by Mr. Candler, the official correspondent with Force D. This article is not good propaganda either for this country or Arabia The “white man’s burden” motif is precisely the one to eliminate from British and Arab minds; nothing is more calculated to vex the modernised Arab than writing in this strain. Mr. Candler is sincere and truthful, and after an affair like Dargai or Omdurman such an article would not be out of place ; but after Kut and Gallipoli it will appear to educated Arabs as uncalled for as the condescending airs of a “ nouveau riche ” of doubtful solvency who buys an ancient estate and patronises the tenantry^ [898—6] fay Ac $ (ty Ai- ,1 2 Nothing is more galling to the Arab intellectual than the picture of the “ omniscient Sahib” and the “ comic native.” Reference is made to the tone of Mr. Candler s ttaniD ana xne uumic nauivo. — . &gt; j + ^ n r article, because it suggests that people on the spot m Mesopotamia do no u ly realise that Mesopotamia is not an isolated problem, but part of the Arab world which, no matter how divided, is one in race and literature. , , . ..

In Appendix (D) the “ Tanins ” observations indicate that the Turks have a definite policy as regards the Holy Places. ^ ^ V &gt;SECRET ; Foe, Reference only. ARABIAN REPORT. N.S. No. VIII.

Colonel Wilson, with Faisal’s concurrence, proposed to try to persuade the Sherif to allow the bombardment of Rabej and the removal of supplies. Faisal had not sufficient forces at his command to prevent the Turks from reaching Rabej if they made a sufficiently sustained effort; therefore Colonel Wilson strongly urged that at least 1,000 Moslem troops should be sent to Yembo with twof^ aeroplanes.' Faisal was remaining at Yembo ; unless he could promise them that help was coming he could not face his Arabs. Sir H. IvlcMahon in regard to this expressed the opinion that the situation was critical, and demanded immediate action. Quickfiring guns and aeroplanes were essential, and, as a temporary measure to supply the place of the latter, the Naval Commander-in-Chief was sending seaplanes. With regard to the sending of Moslem troops he found it difficult to express a definite opinion on account of the views of the Government of India and those of the Sultan of Egypt; the latter fearing that the sending of troops to Hejaz might destroy the Sherifs chance of success as showing his dependence on our support. In reply to these two telegrams the Foreign Office informed Sir H. McMahon [No. 708] that it was impossible to send Mohammedan troops to l r embo, but that munitions would be despatched. As to the possibility of supplying aeroplanes, the War Office was making enquiries, and the French Government was considering the possibility of providing a quick-firing battery with Moslem personnel. On the 2nd September Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 751] that Colonel Wilson was arranging concerted action against Rabej with the S.N.O. in the Red Sea and the Sherifs troops then on their way from Mecca. Colonel Wilson would probably be at Cairo for a conference about the 8th September. The Sherif and Idrisi. The Arab Bureau telegraphed [Baba 51] on the 29th August that at the conference at Birk, between the Sherif’s representative and Idrisi, it was agreed that the latter should strengthen his troops on the eastern border; that he should cut the com munication between Sabbiyah and Ebhah, and in case of attack that he should take offensive action ; and that until the Imam’s intentions (still believed to be pro-Turk) are known, he should remain on the defensive on the southern border. The Sherifs Stamps. Sir R, Rodd telegraphed on the 2nd September [No. 862 (R)] that the Italian Government raised no objection to the Sherif making a provisional issue of stamps as suggested. [See Arabian Report, N.S., VI, p. 2.] The Haj. On the 4th Septembey the Viceroy telegraphed to the High Commissioner in Egypt in regard to the Haj, asking whether intending pilgrims should be prevented from proceeding, in view of the situation in Hejaz. If they should meet with serious trouble it would discredit both us and the Sherif’s cause ; but if there was a reasonable chance of a successful pilgrimage, it was obviously undesirable to stop them. In reply, Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 756] that in Egypt it had been decided that, so long as there was a reasonable chance of success, it would be unwise to prevent the pilgrimage, and therefore the arrangements for it were proceeding. He suggested that, if first pilgrim ship had not already started, and if it could be done without exciting comment, it might be well to delay it till the 10th September, the date fixed for the starting of the second. For the moment, he said, everything seemed to depend on the situation at Rabej, as Jeddah might be threatened later on if the Shakyh were not disposed of. If it held out, the danger to Jeddah might make it advisable to stop the pilgrimage. Propaganda. The suggestion that a literary supplement to the “ Haqiqat ” should be prepared in Egypt for insertion in Basra was transmitted to Cairo. General Clayton in reply said that the suggestion was regarded as most excellent, but that it was impossible to | take it up on account of the expense and the lack of staff to run it properly.IBN SAUD. The C.P.O. at Basra has sent, among other papers, a copy of a treaty between the Indian Government and Ibn Baud which was signed on the 26th December, 19lo, and ratified on the 18th July, 1916. By this Ibn Baud undertakes not to enter into any treaty, agreement, or correspondence with any foreign Power or JN ation ; and no ■ &gt; C ede sell, or mortgage any territory recognised by the British Government as belonging to them, without the consent of that, Government. He also agrees to keep open the road to places of pilgrimage; to protect pilgrims ; and not to interfere wi the territories of Koweyt or Bahrein, or those of the Shaykhs of the Qatar and Oman coast under the protection of the British Government.

Ihe G ™7 n FL mmercial Code was restricted in application, and in cases French in origin ; but the Co Muialli, a code, resting on religious law, beyond its scope recourse was had to the mujani,4 a. m ’ l ' ', ir| i -f &gt; 11,0 . drawn up by Turkish jurists. A large number of cases were beyond the jurisdicton of the ordinary civil Courts; such were domestic disputes, marriage, divorce, relations between husband and wife or father and child, inheritance, and all questions relating to land. These were dealt with in the c ‘ ecclesiastical Courts by Shara law. The religious law administered in the Shara’ Courts and those which applied the Muj^tq code was that of one school of the Sunni—and this in Mesopotamia, where 90 per cem. of population is Shiah. Theoretically the same law was administered throughout the Empire, but in the Arab country it was practically operative only in the towns. Elsewhere recourse was had|to the Emir or to the headman, who judged without code or settled procedure ; or to the tribal Saiyid who acted as arbitrator. For the people of whom Miss Bell here speaks, Sir John Nixon, as General Officer Commanding the Army of Occupation, promulgated a Code, of which the Chief Political Officer has sent a copy. The effect of the promulgation of this Code is practically to apply the law, civil and criminal, of British India to the occupied territory : and, in a schedule attached, between thirty and forty Indian Acts are set out as having the force of law. Among these are the Indian Contract Act, the Indian Companies Act, the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, the Indian Merchant Shipping Acts, the Negotiable Instruments Act, and the Indian Lunacy Act. Provision is, however, made for cases which came within the jurisdiction of the Shara’ Courts. Proceedings are instituted in the British Court, by which the matter is referred to a Mohammedan jurist for arbitration, such jurist to be selected, as far as possible, by the parties. His decision may, in certain circumstances, be referred back for further consideration : should he refuse or fail to revise it, the decision is treated as void and the matter is referred to another. In certain circumstances, too, a decision may be set aside; but this is only done in case of corruption or misconduct on the part of the jurist, or fraudulent deceit on that of one of the parties. Eventually, when an unchallenged decision has been given, judgment, in accordance with that decision, is given by the British Court. 91 I 15 V** APPENDIX (A). History of Sayyid Talib and his Family. (By H. Dobbs.) THE family of the Nakibs of Basra claim to be descendants of the great Mohammedan saint, Sayyid Ahmad-er-Bifai, whose tomb stands in the centre of the Jazira, half way between the Albu Darraj territory and the Hai. He was a purely Sunni saint, and is held in no honour by the Shiahs. Large tracts of land from time to time assigned to the Nakibs for the upkeep of the tomb of Sayyid Ahmad-er-Bifai, and also for that of the less well-known saint, Sayyid Shaban, whose tomb lies between Basra and Zobair. These lands were properly Mulhaqa Waqf, the Nakib of the time being Mutawalli; and the Nakibs were bound by religious laws to spend the proceeds of the lands entrusted to them on the upkeep of the shrines. The latest Nakibs have been :— Sayyid Talib (from Mendeli). (Succeeded his brother-in-law, Abdul Rahman.) Sayyid Abdur Rahman (died 1874 childless). Sister. Sayyid Muhammad Said (died 1896, having resigned in 1890). Sayyid Rejjeb Sayyid Ahmad (present Nakib appointed in 1890). (died 1904). Sayyid Talib. Sajyid Yusuf. Hamad. Sayyid Hashim. It appears that about the year 1890 the present Nakib, Sayyid Rejjeb, under the influence of his brother, Sayyid Ahmad, who had made much money by gun-running, managed by bribery and other means to get the various lands held by him as Mulhaqa Waqf registered by the Tapu Department as the private property of himself and his brother. This was to the advantage of Sayyid Ahmad, as otherwise the Waqf property would have descended to the elder branch as Mutwallis. There happened to be in Basra an exceptionally honest Wall, Hamdi Pasha. He got wind of this transaction and began moving to prevent the fraud. Thereupon Sayyid Rejjeb used his influence in Constantinople and Bagdad to get Hamdi Pasha dismissed. In 1899 Hamdi Pasha was again appointed Wali at Basra, and again came into conflict with the Nakib, Sayyid Rejjeb. The Nakib, in council with Shaykh Mubarak of Koweyt, who also disliked Hamdi Pasha, and who was a firm friend of the Nakib’s family owing to their joint participation in gun-running, sent Sayyid Talib, his son, to Constantinople to represent that all troubles with the Shaykh of Koweyt was due to Hamdi Pasha. This was the first occasion of Sayyid Talib’s entry into Constantinople politics. He succeeded in getting Hamdi Pasha dismissed and in procuring the appointment as Y/ali of Muhsin Pasha, military commandant, who was friendly both to Shaykh Mubarak and to the Nakib. Owing to this success and the support of the new WhJi, Muhsin Pasha, and of Shaykh Mubarak, Sayyid Talib now became a powerful personality in Basra. His next step in the year 1900 was to secure the support of Shaykh Khazalof Mohammerah by the murder of Abdullah Effendi Rawanduzia Kurd, the particular enemy of Shaykh Khazal. The valuable 'Basra date gardens of the Mohammerah family stood in the name of Muzel, elder brother of Shaykh Khazal. Muzel was a Turkish subject, and so was allowed to hold land. When Muzel was assassinated m Mohammerah, Shaykh Khazal took steps to have the date gardens transferred to his own name. Rawanduzi telegraphed to Constantinople pointing out that Khazal was a Persian subject and could not under the law hold land in Turkey. He claimed 10 per cent, of the value of the land as informer. Thereupon Mirza Hamza, the Shaykh s agent, conferred with Sayyid Talib, who had Rawanduzi shot in the streets ol Basra by two of his men. Frightened by this demonstration, the Turkish authorities gave way and allowed the properties to be registered in Shaykh KhazaTs name. Sayyid Talib was thus instrumental in getting Shaykh Khazal acknowledged as owner of the Basra properties. From this time onwards Sayyid Talib yearly received large sums fiom [898—6] Cthe Shaykhs of Mohammerah and Koweyt to induce him to look after their interests in Basra. About 1902 Sayyid Talib, using the powerful support of the Wall and of Shaykh Mubarak and Khazal, was appointed Mutesarm of Hasa, but his regime there was so cruel that he had to be speedily removed, and returned to Basra. Sayyid Talib, with his uncle Sayyid Ahmad, now set up in Bas^a as a regularf' bully, levying blackmail on all the rich men and plundering anyone who refused to serve him by means of professional robbers, whom he kept in his house. Among others, he openly robbed Abdur Bazzak, son of Haji Taha. His career was checked in 1904 by the dismissal of his friend, the Wali Muhsin Pasha, and the appointment of a strong man, Mukhlis Pasha. Mukhlis Pasha surrounded the house of Sayyid TaUb and Sayyid Ahmad, and arrested their whole band of hired blackguards. Sayyid Ahmad died of chagrin at the end of 1904 ; and the next Wall, Fikri Pasha, in the beginning of 1905, got Sayyid Talib removed to Constantinople, v. here he was made a member of the Saraj Dowla. Here he made friends with Sayyid Abdul Hidr and Prince Izzeddin, who was lately assassinated. When the Committee of Union and Progress was first formed in 1909, Sayyid Talib returned to Basra and tried to be recognised there as leader of the new party. But they feared him, and, in order to get rid of him from Basra, sent him as a deputy to Constantinople. There he made friends with Sadik Bey, and together with him evolved the idea of the “ HuiT-i-Mutadil,” or Moderate-Liberal movement, which practically became the name of the policy of the Young Arab party. He returned constantly to Basra to oppose the Union and Progress party there, and earned the approval and friendship of the late Grand Vizier, Kiamil Pasha, by so doing. His chief partisans in Basra were Arif Bey Mardinli (now in Constantinople), Ahmad-es- Sanaa Pasha, Abdul Latif Mandil, and Shaykh Ibrahim of Zubair. His principal opponent was Sadun Pasha of the Muntafiks, wLo consistently advocated subservience to the Committee of Union and Progress. Him Sayyid Talib destroyed early in 1911, by decoying him into the power of the Wali, after the Muntafiks had rebelled against him. Sayyid Talib thus earned the lasting enmity of Ajaimi, son of Sadun. When Kiamil Pasha became Grand Vizier in 1912 he advised Sayyid Talib to make advances to the British. In pursuance of this policy Sayyid Talib visited Egypt at the beginning of 1912, made friends with the Khedive, and met Lord Kitchener, and on returning from Egypt went up to Simla with letters of introduction from Mr. Crow, British consul at Basra, and saw Lord Hardinge. On his return from Simla in 1912, Sayyid Talib, secure in the support of the Shaykhs of Koweyt and Mohammerah, and, as he probably thought, of the British, seems fcr the first time to have definitely conceived the idea of governing the Basra vilayat himself and becoming Shaykh or Emir of all the Arabs of Basra. He seems to have abandoned at this stage his former ideal of democratic government by local Arab assemblies, and to have substituted the ideal of a great confederation of Arab Shaykhs and Emirs&gt; each of them autocratic in his own dominions, but banded together to carry out general Arab aims under perhaps the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan. The confederacy would apparently have consisted of the Sherif of Mecca, the Jman Yahya in Yemen, Sayyid Idris, Ibn Rashid, Ibn Saud, the Shaykhs of Mohammerah and Koweyt, and Sayyid lalih as hhaykh or Emir of the Basra Vilayat. How the great tribes of Bagdad were to be represented is not clear ; but the Kurdish chiefs were to be allowed to join the movement. The first step necessary for Sayyid Talib was evidently to make himself paramount in the Basra vilayat. This he attempted to secure by cultivating friendly relations with the Amara Shaykhs through the Shaykh of Moharumerah, and by influencing the grant of leases to those Shaykhs at the Basra headquarters. Simultaneously he tried to get nold of the Muntafiks oy winning over Abdullah-el-Faleh, the rival of Sadun Pasha and of Ajaimi, and one of the claimants to the headship of the Muntafik tribes. Ibis Sayyid lalib diet through Ahmad-es-Sanaa Pasha. He finally induced the Wali to support Abdullah-el-Faleh against the recalcitrant tenant of Muamer, Haji Neghaimish, and to put the Faleh family in 1913 into possession of this very valuable estate which had long been useless to them. Having now temporarily secured all the Arabs of the Basra Vilayat, Sayyid Talib proceeded in April 1910 to get up a public protest against the new vilayat law, and threatened to use force against the Wali. His proceedings were suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Ajaimi with a considerable force outside Basra, who appeared openly as the supporter or the Wali and of the Committee of Union and Progress against Sayyid lalib. Simultaneously the Wall of Basra (Ala-ud-Din Bey) and the Military7 Commandant (Firid Bey) seemed to have secret instructions from Constantinople to help Ajaimi and to murder or capture Sayyid Talib. Fights began in Basra between the adnerents ot Abdullah-el-t aleh and Ajaffni 5 more and more of Ajaimi’s men drifted into Basra, with the connivance of the Wall and Commandant; and Sayyid Talib’s position seemed exceedingly precarious when on the 19th June, 1913, his adherents assassinated Commandant as he was landing from a boat in the Ashar Creek, and mortally wounded the Mutesarrif of the Muntafik who was with him. This frightened the Turkish Government. The Wali was dismissed, an acting Wall, Izzat Bey, was appointed, and in August 1913 a programme of reforms was published which made many concessions to the Arabs. This does not seem to have satisfied the Arab Committee, who at the end of August distributed among the troops and Arab tribes a long address calling all men of xlrab race to rise and throw off Turkish tyranny by asserting the independence of Iraq. Enver Bey, who was now in power, ordered the Military Commandant to arrest Sayyid Talib, but the Commandant reported that he was powerless. In December 1913 Sayyid Talib sent a second threatening address to Constantinople. Enver Bey then telegraphed to him making advances and saying that he had ordered the Walis of Basra and Bagdad to consult him about everything. The Sultan conferred a high order upon him, and Sayyid Talib issued in January 1913 a manifesto saying that all differences were removed between him and the Turkish Government, and that he would in future do all that lay in him to promote Ottoman unity. Finally, in May 1914, Sayyid Talib seemed to have reached the zenith of his power. The Minister of the Interior telegraphed offering him the choice between the posts of Ambassador, Wali, or member of the Senate, and in July Talaat Bey informed the British Ambassador that Sayyid Talib was to be made Wali of Basra. In the meanwhile Djaved Pasha, Wali of Bagdad, seems to have had secret instructions to arrest Sayyid Talib. He tried to induce Subhi Bey to do so, and failing, started down in October 1914 towards Basra himself for the purpose with a considerable force, arriving just after the outbreak of war with Great Britain. Sayyid Talib had news of his intentions and withdrew to Koweyt, ostensibly with the purpose of negotiating to bring Ibn Sand in against the British. Sayyid Talib was still in Koweyt when the British occupation of Basra took place. He made extravagant demands as to the price of his assistance and, when these were refused, voluntarily withdrew to India. It is said that the Shaykhs of Mohammerah and Koweyt no longer desire his return, since their estates in Basra territory are now safe and he could be of no use to them. APPENDIX (B). The Italian Peess on Italy and Asia Minor. In certain towns (for instance, in Borne and Milan, hut not in Turin or Bologna), an'Athens report, according to which British transports have been seen near Bhodes and a landing was imminent at Alexandretta, was allowed to appear in the press. To this report the “ Tribuna ” (23rd) appends an important editorial note :— “ England has now disembarked her troops there. This is an event of great importance, whether locally or in relation to the general facts of European policy. For England Alexandretta has always been a point of first-rate strategical import ance in her Oriental activities To-day, now that Germany’s ambitious plans are defeated, it may well become in England’s hands the railhead of an English Bagdad-Persian Gulf Line. Whilst noting with sincere satisfaction this landing of our Allies, we hope that our own interests in the East have been successfully and adequately protected by our Government.” To this reported landing the “ Idea Nazionale ” (25th) devotes a long editorial leader, which will be dealt with in next week’s Summary. However, the Italian press did not await the publication of this report in order to discuss the problem of Asia Minor. As lias been noted, all important articles on the Salonica landing refer directly or indirectly to this question. Indeed, during the week under consideration there seems to have been what amounts to an organised agitation for Italy’s “ Asiatic rights.”Thus, the “ Stampa” (18th) prints a long article from its Petrograd correspondent, Virtdnio Gayda, urging that the Government should lose no time in coming to an under standing with the Allies on the question of Italy’s interests in Asia Minor and the Balkans. Gayda makes the following main points : 1. England and Pussia have twice discussed, and apparently have now settlec^ their Eastern and Near Eastern relations. On both these occasions Italy seems to have been absent. 2. The Eastern question is, then, approaching its solution. Italy is the Ally of the Powers that opened it, and who are now about to solve it. ^ She ought to have from her Allies an explicit recognition of her Oriental interests. 3. Salonica is almost certain to be taken aw r ay from Greece and internationalised, and Italy must have her part in the matter, t here is also question of the southern limits of the new Serbia—again of interest to Italy. _ ^ 4. Finally, there is the question of the Straits, of Constantinople, and of Pussia s entry into the Mediterranean, with which is involved the question of Asia Minor—of vital importance for Italy. Before the war four Powers England, Pussia, France, and Germany—had reached a definite agreement by means of reciprocal concessions. This agreement is important, because it provides a ready-made scheme for the new agreement under discussion among the Allies, which is to substitute actual possession for concessions of influence in Asiatic Turkey—Germany’s share now apparently being assigned to France. Italy came late to Asia Minor, and only obtained a conditional concession from the Gulf of Budrum as far as Adana. And even this was contested by her neighbours—by the Germans and Austrians, and, moreover, by the English, vdio wished to keep Italy out of the Gulf of Budrum, and who talked of a plot on the part of the Triple Alliance to get command of the Eastern Mediterranean. It seemed that there was no place for Italy in Asia Minor while she formed part of the Triple Alliance. But now the position is changed. Italy has taken her part in the war, and has a right to her part in the settlement. England was very liberal in her offers to Greece earlier in the war, and Italy ought surely to rank before Greece. The correspondent concludes by again urging that Italian troops should be sent to Salonica, as a symbol of Italy’s interest in the Eastern question. (This article was, of course, written before the Salonica landing was made public, and was followed by the editorial note to which reference has already been made in the last Summary. It was also published in the “ Mattino ” (Naples), which shares the “ Stampa’s” news service.) On the 20 th the “ Corriere della Sera ” followed with an article by Senator Leopold© Franchetti:— In view of eventual peace negotiations and of the attempts which are sure to be made to create trouble between the Allies, it is to be hoped that a stable settlement may early be reached, which will leave no question open that may be a source of danger to peace. To this end the claims of all parties should be clearly made known, so that Governments may have public opinion behind them. Italy’s legitimate aspirations are modest in comparison with those of the other Allies, for any expansion outside the lines of her natural development would exhaust rather than strengthen her power. For Italy’s right in Libya and Erithraea and Benadir, Dr. Franchetti refers his readers to his own pamphlet on the subject, adding that it would be only reasonable that the zones of influence to which Italy’s right was recognised by Great Britain m the protocols of 1891 and 1874 (Kassala) should be restored to her, and that French Somaliland (a small strip of territory, originally occupied as a menace to Italy—-a purpose incompatible with present Franco-Italian relations) should be ceded to Italy m exchange for some fair equivalent. As regards Asia Minor, the parts which the Turks would continue to occupy would become “ zones of influence,” the rest possessions of the Allies. The lines of eventual partition were clearly indicated. Russia could have Armenia, i the Asiatic coast of the Black Sea, the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmora, and the Dardanelles. Enaland would take the nnrt ni Alexandretta. to he the terminus of theBosphorus, the Sea of Marmora, and the Dardanelles, by the ^gean Sea and the Taurus and anti-Taurus ranges.” c5 It will be noticed that Franchetti grants to England the zone of Alexandretta and south-eastern Taurus. This is not the intention of the “ Idea,” which, on the 23rd, provides its promised discussion of the frontiers of the future Italian Asia Minor. The article is headed “ Anatolia Necessary” : — The Asia Minor problem is entirely a matter of railways and ports. The country is, in fact, an age-long centre of trade communication between continents, of a traffic which has been intense in the past and is going to be still more intense in the future. “ That is why international policy in the Near East has been during the last decades a railway policy : the concession &gt;of a railway like the Bagdad line is as valuable as a conquest; a monopoly in the exploitation of a port is equal to the acquisition of a colony. And for this reason a rational redistribution of spheres of influence can only be made on the basis of the various networks of communications.” The zone of Adalia, even if the neighbouring coastal region of the Taurus were added to it, would be a perfectly worthless concession ; not only is Adalia cut off from the main routes of maritime traffic, which go directly to Smyrna or Alexandretta, but also from the great railway system of Anatolia. Moreover, it is barren and possesses no good roads. Italy, then, must have a sphere of influence linked up to the railway and maritime system of Asia Minor. The Bagdad line is the backbone of Asia Minor, and its main outlets indicate perfectly the spheres of influence for the various Allies:— 1 . Russia would have the network of Northern Anatolia with the ports of Trebizond and Samsun (which in the future would probably be provided with railway communication to Batoum and Kars, and, if Allies agreed to it, to Ismid on the Sea of Marmora). 2. England the Mesopotamian stretch of the Bagdad line with its railhead on the Persian Gulf. 3. France the ports of Syria with the Palestine trade, and, more important, the trade with the Holy Places of Arabia. 4 . To Italy would fail the fourth and essentially Mediterranean zone, with the four ports of Smyrna, Adalia, Mersina, and Alexandretta. Of these four ports the natural and legitimate hinterland is Southern Anatolia. And the surrender of Italy’s claim to any one of them would fatally compromise her participation in the Turkish inheritance. The article goes on to describe with minute detail the precise frontiers of this Italian zone, and then points out that these concessions to Italy would be made almost entirely at the expense of Germany, and would in no way prejudice any important interest of any Ally. It concludes by describing tbe eminently suitable character of the country for the purposes of colonisation. . -i • ti To the “ Stampa” and “ Mattino” (24th) Yirginio Gayda contributes an admirable discussion of the Busso-Japanese Treaty, which, be says, frees Russia from all Tar Eastern preoccupations, and will enable her to intervene in the Near Eastern a lairs in a way which may prove a serious problem for Italy. Here, again, is an appeal for a definite staking-out and recognition of Italy’s Mediterranean claims. And, lastly, the “ Mattino ” (24th) demands that England should cede Kismayu (port on the Indian Ocean at the mouth of the Juba River) to Italy. . * , . , From the articles which have been summarised above, the dominant place wnicti Imperialism—with the related event of the Salonica landing occupies at present in newspaper discussions, will be realised. FTaken from the “Daily Review of the Foreign Press ” (W.O.) for the 1st September, 1916.] “II Secolo” (25th August) reports from Rome that “the news of the British landing at Alexandretta, and the questions concerning Italian influence m Asm ^ tuor, have been the subject of various polemics during the last few days. 1 e Nazionale” is then quoted. After again describing the immense increase of territory and influence in the East which Great Britain stands to gam from the war Ofl/* Review ” 15th July, p. 9 ; 17th August, p. 10 ; and 24th August, p. 9 ) the iNationalist journal adds that, if to all this were to be added the “ hinterland ” of Alexandretta, thejr*. ■ 10 gain of Britain would be increased to a quite unforeseen degree. But Italy would be content to give up her claims to Alexandretta if her sphere of influence were enlarged so as to include not only all Southern and Central Anatolia from Mersina west of Alexandretta to Smyrna on the west coast, but also the Asiatic coast of the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora as far as Scutari, so as to reach the railheads at Ism id and Haidar Pasha. And this solution would not be so difficult as it might appear to be(^ For while Russia would get Armenia, the Black Sea coast, and the European side of the Straits, England would avoid the danger of leaving both shores in the hands of a single Power. If Italy were given possession of the eastern shore there need be no feeling of rivalry between the occupiers of the opposite shores, as there would be if Great Britain were established there. [From “ Daily B,eview ” (W.O.) of the 2 nd September, 1916. J APPENDIX (C). The British Subaltern as Judge. (From Edmund Candler.) Nasiriyeh. Nasiriyeh when we first occupied it during the flood season last year was more than a physical island ; it was an island in an abstract sense, a small cosmos isolated in chaos, but a cosmos that was always extending its bounds. Outside the walls of the town the anarchy that had ruled for generations was rife, inside was peace and content. A student of British methods could not do better than pass a day in a town like Nasiriyeh a year after occupation, and spend a morning in the Court of the Military Governor. In the seat of authority you will probably find a very young* officer— one of the type who has been in the habit of spending his leave before the war in Persia, Arabia, or the Himalayas, shooting strange beasts, picking up strange dialects, and studying the ways of stranger people. Here you have Empire in the egg ; and such young men—subalterns, generally “ acting captains,” or captains generally “ acting majors”—are indispensable during the incubation of any new Imperial brood. Decision is a habit with them, they are used to hard cases ; they have acquired an insight into obscure motives. Their judgments are quick and summary, free of pedantry, and seldom hampered by doubts and hesitations. And the proof of this system is its popularity. In the mornings the approach to the Military Governor’s Court is crowded, you will meet in the passage haughty Arabs, meek Sabaeans, furtive looking Jews, mysterious women wrapped from head to foot in black weeds. Here are some of the problems they submit to the decision ot youth. Enter Shaft az Hussein; he claims a horse from Shaukat now in jail. Decree: “Two thieves fallen out. Court refuses to act.” Enter Sabhi ( Sabsean , mukhtar and priest. Complaint that the Sabsean girls are all marrying Mohammedans, and the race is in danger of dying out. Petition: That the Governor may summon all the Sabman ladies of Nasiriyeh and address them on this matter ; doubtless they will be persuaded to change their ways. Or, if they persist in error, that a law may be passed prohibiting such undesirable alliances. Decree : Sabhi, mukhtar and priest, informed that the Sabseans must settle their own affairs. Enter a Mashhufchi. Petition : Licence to export five dead bodies (for internment at the Holy Shrine) to Nejef. Decree : “ Granted.” Enter (a) Fatima, veiled and shiouded in the prevalent black; (b) Fatima’s husband. Complaint : Fatima’s husband has confiscated her house and jewellery and cow, beaten her, and turned her out of doors. She unfolds a pitiful tale. But the voice proceeding from the black bundle is the voice of a shrew. Altercation ensues. The husband is a browbeaten creature. There are faults on both sides—chiefly the woman’s, whose lies are the more gross and palpable. The end of it all is that she shrieks and gesticulates and so generally gives herself and her shrewish temper away that she is given a week’s imprisonment for contempt of Court. A Jewish woman complains that her husband has deserted her and her child.' Decree : Husband to live with wife or pay her 8 annas a day ; woman to report again in eight days. * \11 Applicant is mother of a, girl who wishes to remarry, her husband being reported dead or prisoner of war in India. Decree : Enquiries to be made at internment camp, and if husband is not traced, the girl to be permitted to marry again. In one case a husband and wife came to Court with tales of domestic strife, and the Judge noted that the name of a third party was continually cropping up in their ^|omplaints. At last the husband disclosed the root of the evil. u I do not wish to divorce my wife,’’ he said, “but I cannot endure that the mother of my wife should dwell in the house.” The Governor’s advice: “ Remove the mother-in-law, delivered with the authority of a decree, was acted on with no great reluctance on either side, and the issue was peace. . It augurs well for future relations that famdies should he so ready to confide their troubles in a Judge who is not only very useful, but a stranger to them in accents anc mien and habit of thought. , , I was told—and it is probably true, or the Courts would not be so crowded tna the Arabs regard our justice as prompt and summary; cheap, and at the same time final; capable of error, but not of corruption. The Turkish system was too cumbrous ; it was difficult to get a decree executed, and the balance of the scales woulc not lespon to a lean purse. The general impression seems to be that the Biitish officii at tie sea of judgment may not be Solomon, but that he is more often right than wiong. One more picture, which is in its way symbolical. In a provincial Court a certain old lady—not of Nasiriyeh—brought a petition in a matter that was very near her heart. ' It was an ancient wrong ; but with a new kind of Judge, she thought, there might be some faint hope of redress ; justice, after years of suppiession, img i eme.ge in her naked brightness from her wrappings of prejudice and corruption 1 his was exactly what happened, and the old lady so far forgot her composure that she stooped quickly and aimed a kiss at the top of the Deputy Military Governors head. Happily for the dignity of this young officer, he saw it coming, dodged, and received the salute on the nap 3 of the neck. . r . . 4 -u ™ No doubt; a generation will pass before the machine runs with perfect smoothness, but one may read into this scene a certain comtorting allegorical suggestion. [The “Times,” 6 th September, 1916.] APPENDIX (D). Miscellaneous Cuttings from the Press. The “ Tan in ” and the Sheri fs Revolt. The revolt was started by the former Emir, Hussein Pasha (who sold his conscience to the Britisbl with help from several brigand tribes. The British, with the intention of sowing discord among the os ems,^ ooc advantage of the situation and prevented the Holy Pilgrimage; this owever, exasperated the tribes which derived benefit from the Pilgrimage. Hussern, intoxicated bTBrilish gold joined the enemy, while at the same time he promised the Ottoman Government thft he would help in the Egyptian campaign and asked ^ “ g r P s 1 j Arab volunteers to be enlisted and equipped; he also asked that his child succeed him in direct line. , ic- a Tbp Offoman Government did not fall mto this tiap, . . •, ,, Before he received a reply he attempted to attack Medina and destroyed m Heja One small force of a few hundred at Jeddah had to cope with brigands by land and thT BrMshby sea ; they only surrendered when water and ammunition were eX “mi*hes took place at Mecca ; the attacks of the rebels on Medina and the •i wppp remi sed the railway repaired, and order re-established. ^Ajr TJTXJt arraifisbnaCer of the situation, and possesses plenty of ammumUo^ Eiml f Igp troops, will shortly march on Mecca and meet out severe punishment to Hussein. „ ^ ^ 2(;th July0appreciation of attached ARAB REPORT No. VII (New Series). THE situation in which the Sherif now finds himself is somewhat dangerous. The Turks have evidently not been much demoralised by the losses they sustained in the reconnaissance at Romani, and still occupy almost as large an area of Egyptian territory as before. While concentrating formidable forces at Medina they can impress one of the best informed of our agents with the strength of their potential offensive against Egypt. The most favourable news is the entrance of Ibn Sha’alan into the Sherif’s ranks. The general impression to be gathered regarding the internal condition of Syria from our agent’s reports is that the Turks deem their best way of keeping Syria quiet is to endeavour to show that we cannot attack them, but that they can attack us in Egypt; although weak and unpopular, the Turks can thus produce the impression in Syria that we are even more feeble than they. Should the Turks manage to reach Mecca before or during the pilgrimage the result would be in every way disastrous ; there are great difficulties in the way of the Turks, and doubtless the Arabs will make a brave resistance, but it must not be forgotten that in war Turks sometimes make efforts beyond expectation or even calculation. The Idrisi affair at Comfida has been satisfactorily settled for the present, justifying Colonel Wilson’s optimism. In India the excitement regarding the Arabian revolt seems to have subsided; however, a Turkish reoccupation of Mecca or an unsuccessful pilgrimage would doubtless serve to raise the ferment in an aggravated form. The two appendices by Miss Bell, one on education and one on administration in Irak, deserve careful study. The administration, it is to be assumed, is of a temporary nature, and so long as it is applied to such wild and chaotic country as the area now occupied by us, there is little to be concerned about, one way of keeping order being as good as another ; however, it is my opinion that Indian law and Indian method cannot be adopted in areas which may presently come under our control. Baghdad has been under a rdgime of a continental European kind'for many years, and the upper and middle classes have lived on terms of social equality with the ruling race, and have had opportunities of holding the highest executive offices in the capital of the Empire. The appendix regarding education also requires consideration. In the Arabs we have a people who combine exceedingly sharp wits with intense vitality. Sooner or later the Arab race will make itself felt. It depends upon us now to adopt a really intelligent attitude towards the Arabs. If our education is merely a stupid infliction of information, without history, poetry, and the humanities, we shall produce instead of the futile seditionist of Egypt and the loquacious pleader of India a really dangerous and desperate Sinn Feiner. To tackle the educational problem in Irak, we require to study.Ai^b mentality and [898-5]tiff 2 TM/t potentiality with attention, and our past blunders in educational work in the East with fearless humility. Attention is drawn to the extracts from the Italian press, which, in view of Italy’s declaration of war against Germany, assume a special significance. M r S. P.S., AlO p.m., August 31, 1916 — Since the report and appreciation were written, a telegram has come from Sir H. McMahon giving the results of Colonel Wilson’s interview with Faisal. It is now clear that the Turks are about to begin an advance upon Mecca, and that without assistance neither the Sherif nor Faisal has much hope of checking it. M. S.SECRET. For Reference only.

G. 1247] that:— 1. Deserters from Tail said that the garrison was getting short of food; it was strongly entrenched on a hilltop with a water supply. 2. There was heavy fighting at Medina. Faisal estimated the Turkish force to be nearly 30,000, but this was doubtless an exaggeration. He also reported fighting both south and west of Medina, at about a day’s march from the town, the intention of the Turks being to reach Yambo or Mecca. 3. The Sherif regarded the position as critical; he was sending up all possible reinforcements, including two mountain guns and two maxims ; he begged for two aeroplanes to be based on Yambo, partly for intelligence purposes and partly to influence the noithern tribes, who will join the side with most resources. 4. Colonel Wilson was going to Faisal’s camp, and would report. 5. The Sherif said that the Nejd Shaykhs had offered to cut the Hejaz railway, and to keep it cut. Sir H. McMahon, telegraphing on the following day [No. 724], said that:— 1 . Military Intelligence estimated that the Medina force could not exceed 15,000. 2. The Sherif was making urgent demands for rifles, guns, ammunition, and aeroplanes. Machine-guns were on their way from England ; the General Officer Commanding would try to supply quick-firing guns ; rifles were being sent; but there were no available aeroplanes. 3 . The Sherif thought that the Turks were making a desperate effort to get Ali Haidar into Mecca before the pilgrimage. [An agent reports [jNo. 07112] that he reached Medina on the 8 th August.] [898—5] B2 On the 26th August Sir H. McMahon again telegraphed [No. 728], saying that. 1 . The Sherif had repeated to him a telegram from Faisal stating that he had gained a great victory over the Turks, who had lost two complete battalions, these having been exterminated. Faisals telegram was dated the 25th August, and he was expecting another encounter on the following day.r 2. Faisal reported that the Turks were much stronger than had been expected in artillery. S. Colonel Wilson was to have left for Yambo on the 25th August. The Sherif and Idrisi. Colonel Wilson’s forecast has proved correct. The differences between the Sherif and Idrisi have been arranged, and Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 29th August [No. 731] that he had received a telegram from H.M.S. “ Dufferm ” notifying him that Idrisi’s troops had withdrawn from Comfida without friction on the 25th August. The Prodamaiion. On the 16th August Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy asking for his views as to the publication of the Sherif’s proclamation. Tne Viceroy replied on the 19th August, but his reply could not be given in the last report, as it was only received on the 29th August. The Viceroy said [P. 3316] that they considered the Sherif very ill-advised not to have expunged from his proclamation all reference to the violation of the Holy Places, still, as India was so comparatively quiescent, if it was thought expedient to publish the original proclamation in Egypt there appeared to be little risk in letting it filter through to India in the ordinary course by post, provided that it bears no official information and is published by the Sherif’s own agents. On the 28th -August the Resident at Aden telegraphed to Simla that he had received a copy of the proclamation from Sir H. McMahon, and proposed to circulate it, as nothing but good could accrue from so doing. The proclamation was published in full in the “ Daily Telegraph ” (London) of the 28 th August. The Sherif s Stamps. Lord Bertie telegraphed on the 26th August [No. 882] that the French Government agreed to the proposals of the English Government [see “ Arabian Report” VI, N.S., p. 2], and was giving the necessary instructions. The Haj. General Clayton telegraphed on the 23rd August [I. G. 1247] that the sanitary and police provisions at Jeddah were reported to be good, and that preparations were being made for the pilgrimage next month. Opinion in Afghanistan. An extract from the “North-West Frontier Provincial Diary” for the week ending the 15th July has been received from the India Office. Information is given therein of the attitude in official circles towards the Sherif’s revolt, and of preposterous reports circulated in regard to ourselves. But as the news is six weeks old it is hardly worth while to reproduce it in detail. Opinion in Baluchistan. An extract of the Agency Confidential Diary for the month ending the 15th July shows that the news of the revolt caused very little comment in Baluchistan, though sympathy appeared to be on the side of the Turks. French Mission to the Sherif. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 23rd August [No. 719] that the French Minister had handed him a note verbale in regard to the mission of the Sherif to the following effect:—1. It would be entirely political, and would have nothing to do with the Caliphate, a matter in which his Government had decided not to intervene. The object of the mission was t.o get into touch with the chief who would in future be responsible for the Holy Places and to settle the pilgrim question _ with him. 2 It would consist of two divisions, one civil and the other military ; the latter being subdivided into two groups, one consisting of Moslems who would proceed to Mecca, the other of French officers who would not go to Arabia. The military division was intended to discuss with the Sherif, in agreement with the British military authorities, how best to assist him. i 3. Colonel^ Bremond, the chief of the military division, would also direct the political one; he had been instructed to act only in complete agreement with the British authorities. 4. The military division was to leave Marseilles for Alexandria on the 23rd August. 5. The French Minister had been instructed to ask for the help of the High Commissioner. Sir H. McMahon asked for instructions, and on the 28th August was informed by the Foreign Office [No. 699] that he should put Colonel Brernond in touch with the military authorities, and give the mission every assistance; that Colonel Wilson should be instructed to inform the Sherif of its impending arrival, and otherwise to facilitate its progress, but that he should not describe the mission as “ political.” Sir IT. McMahon was also informed that it was understood, unofficially, that the French Minister’s note went beyond the intentions of his Government, who only wished to make it quite clear that the mission was in no wise concerned with the Caliphate. Sir H. McMahon again telegraphed on the 29th August [No. 735] that the French Minister had informed him that the mission was taking presents of great value and that therefore it was fitting that the Sherif himself should do what was necessary for its transport and safety, and that he should send a suitable representative to Jeddah to take full responsibility. Sir H. McMahon proposed to communicate this to the Sherif. He added that he had suggested that it might injure the Sherif and frustrate our efforts if the mission were advertised as an official one from a Christian Power. He suggested that it would be better for it to be know^n as a congratulatory mission from the Moslems of the French Empire coming with the approval of its sympathetic Government, The French Minister promised to bring this suggestion to the notice of his Government.

More papers have been received from the Chief Political Officer at Basia dealing with the condition of the occupied district and the manner oi its administration on Indian lines. Two of these papers (both written by Miss Gertrude Bell) are printed^ as Appendices (A) and (B). Another, also written by Miss Bell, calls attention to existing-'vXj. si a very and points out that, “ in the event of our remaining in Iraq, the question of our official attitude towards slavery will be a thorny one to handle ; meanwhile it is obviously an issue which we should do our utmost to avoid during our military occupation.” ^ The G.O.C.

The general reports of the G.O.C. have been that the situation was unchanged* but on the 24th August be telegraphed [6875 G.I.] that the Turks were making an increased effort to stop the caravan traffic between Lahej and Aden, and on the 29th August [6919 G.I.] that six of our agents were overdue. ► PART III.

A DMINISTRATION of Justice in the Occupied Territories of Lower Mesopotamia. (By Miss Gertrude Bell.) It was recognised from the first that the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1890 ceased to be applicable in these territories from the moment they came under our military occupation; that any laws made or administered must be based solely on the fact of effective military occupation, in conformity with the provisions of section 3 of the Hague Convention, and that in consequence such enactments must take the form of Orders issued by the army commander, who can by notification depute his powers to civil judicial officers and regularise the exercise of them in the form of codes or otherwise. The recognition of the capitulations in the occupied territory during the war was judged inadmissible. The fact that practically all Turkish civil and judicial officials had left their posts before the occupation and that most of those who remained were not willing to continue their functions, was considered to make any general application of Turkish law imprac ticable ; but the general spirit of the Hague Convention, which required that the law of the country previous to the occupation should, so far as possible, be administered, was conformed to by the ‘Iraq code, which provided that, subject to stated exceptions, Turkish civil law should be applicable. The exceptions, however, include the bulk of cases coming before the Courts. The judicial staff at present consists of:— 1 . The Senior Judicial Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Knox, C.I.E., barrister-at- law, exercising the powers conferred on the District and Sessions Judge under the ‘Iraq Occupied Territories Code. 2. The Junior Judicial Officer, Captain C. F. Mackenzie, exercising the powers of Assistant Judge and District Magistrate under the same code. Together with the Assistant Judicial Officer, he was invested with the powers of a Small Cause Court Judge. 3 . Assistant Judicial Officer, Khan Sahib Agha Mirza Muhammad, invested: (1) with the powers of a first-class Subordinate Judge and Magistrate ; and ( 2 ) with those of a Small Cause Court Judge. He is President of the Court of W ards. 4 . Begistrar of the Basra Court of Small Causes, Mr. F. F. Chapgur, invested &amp; with the powers of a judge for the trial of suits the subject matter of which did not exceed 20 rupees in value. As regards the subordinate establishment employed by the Courts, 9 Indians have been imported and 34 local men are employed, of whom 25 are Mohammedans of ‘Iraq origin.

P T j- • . ,i Indian Laws.—The experiment of introducing a number of Indian laws into the occupied territories will be watched with interest. Indian laws are now_ quoted m e Courts by litigants at least as frequently as Turkish, and on y one ms ance q ne litigant’s objectiug to come under Indian laws has occurred^ t was an app ica 1 ° 1 p &gt; 5 the'President of the Court of Wards to the District Court for the removal of a guardian alleged to be unsatisfactory^ It was contended that this case shou d e rans erred o the Sharah The case is still sub judice. , • r* i • + Fees.—A fairly substantial court fee is charged on the presentation of a plamt, with the object of preventing unnecessary and light-hearted litigation such as had c■I 6 swamped the Turkish Courts. The court fee is regulated by a sliding scale, as in India. Non-litigious Character of People. —The population of the ‘Iraq is not, however, litigious like that of India, and the people show much greater probity in their cases than is common elsewhere. As a rule, the defendant will admit the facts of the caa^ Evidence on oath is exceedingly reliable among the better classes; moreover, the testimony of an oath on the part of the defendant is readily accepted by the plaintiff. The people are accustomed to settlement by arbitration and some 10 per cent, of the cases are thus adjudicated. Arbitrators in Basra, are usually wealthy merchants or landowners, and may be trusted to do their utmost to come to a just decision. It is more difficult in the adjacent country districts to get reliable men, and it has been necessary, on occasion, to reverse the decisions given by them. Appeals.—Appeals are remarkably few, partly because of the cost involved in payment of court fees to the Court of Appeal (tbe District Court). There were, in 1915, eight appeals to the District Court, and in seven cases the decision of the Court of First Instance was upheld. The number of appeals, however, must naturally increase if our administrative area increases. Expedition shown by Courts. —The people, accustomed to the dilatory processes of Turkish Courts, are amazed and delighted by the expedition shown by the British Courts. Much executive work was inherited from the Turkish Courts, but the suits based on Turkish decrees were almost all disposed of before the end of 1915. Anj extension of our administration area must make the transaction of legal business a more lengthy process, and in order to keep pace with growing needs a liberal increase of well-paid judicial officers should not be grudged. Criminal Cases. —Only four criminal cases came before the Court in 1915, most of the criminal work being dealt with by deputy military Governors, who do not exercise functions under the Traq Code. There is, however, remarkably little serious crime, and that which exists is mainly theft or robbery under arms. Murder is infrequent. The bulk of the criminal cases in the country districts are not brought before a British tribunal, but go for adjudication to the tribal chief. On the Shatt-al-Arab he is generally the Sbaykh of Muhammerah, whose tribesmen inhabit the greater part of both banks of the river ; while small disputes are settled by the sheikhs of the sections, all of whom, with one exception, live in Persian territory. Pleaders. —A difficult question had to be considered at the outset, nor has a specific solution as yet been reached. It was felt to be advisable to prevent, if possible, the influx of a large body of Indian pleaders, and there being in Basra a wholly insufficient number of accredited Arab pleaders, who had passed the Turkish examinations and qualified as advocates, pleaders, as such, were prohibited. Litigants were, however, permitted to have agents, and these were taken from the old class of Turkish pleaders, supplemented by a few touts who would not have been qualified to appear in Turkish Courts. The question will in all probability adjust itself naturally at the end of the war, meantime, the only pleaders who had received the Turkish certificate are Umar Fauzi, an Arab ; Yusuf Elyas, a Jew ; Jamil Sarkis, a Christian ; and Muhammad Wasfi (who had been turned out of the Turkish Court). In addition to these, competent agents are the partners of Jamil Sarkis, one Gabriel, and a Jew named Munaishi Ishaik, who had not taken certificates. Reference^ to Shara ( Law. —Provision is made under the code for the reference of any suit in which at least one party is a Mohammedan to the Shara‘ Law. The selection of the jurist by whom the case should be adjudicated is left to the parties concerned, preference being given as a rule to the choice of the defendant. No qualifications for serving as jurist are laid down, but any person recognised as a religious leader can be selected. The suits referred to the jurists are such as would in Turkish times have come before the Cadi in the Shara‘ Court, that is to say, they are mainly domestic, i.e., relating to marriage, divorce, breach of contract of betrothal, and all questions touching inheritance, &amp;c. But whereas under Ottoman rule the Cadi was always a Sunni, the • Shiahs, who form some 90 per cent, or more of the population of the ‘Iraq, can now have their cases decided by Shiah jurists. On the whole the system has worked verv success fully. Litigants willingly go before the jurists and accept their decisions with respect; the jurists are learned and acute, quick to seize on the points involved, and punctual in replying to the reference made by the Courts. They take a serious view of their responsibilities, expend praiseworthy labour on their decisions, and give clear replies on which it is easy to found a decree. But while they are never unwilling to pronounce decisions on questions of pure law, they are reluctant to deal with issues of fact. This reluctance, though it seems to be justified by the principles of 8 hara‘ Law, is greatly tobe regretted, as it materially detracts from the utility of the jurists. The jurist receives half the court fees, and no difficulty has arisen over this provision of the code. When large interests are involved the very considerable fees which fall to the jurist should go far to place him beyond temptation of corruption. Inheritance. —In one branch of the law only has a change been made which might be regarded as a destruction of existing rights. With the exception of Mohammedans who form the large majority of the population, all classes have been brought under the Indian Succession Act. The Christians put forward no opposition, but with the Jews there was considerable discussion. They agreed that the continuance of the Sunni law of inheritance was hateful to them, but the Conservative party among them wished to return to the old Mosaic tradition, while the Progressive party were in favour of a modern law suitable to a thriving community. The Indian Succession Act appears, however, in practice to have worked among them also with smoothness. Limitation. —It was necessary to waive the Indian Law of Limitations in favour of the Turkish Civil Code by which debts can be collected after the lapse of fifteen years. The period is no doubt too long, but it cannot be modified without full and sufficient notice. Court of Wards. —The Court of Wards has done much good work in a field where it had ample opportunity for its activities. The Turkish Wards Department was a part of the Shara‘ Court, and consisted of one Mudir (at a salary of £ T. 10 a month, subsequently reduced to £ T . 5) and one bailifi*. A board, under the presidency of the Cadi, was formed in connection with the Wards Department ; it was composed of the following officials:— The Mufti of Basra. The Mudir of the Wards Department. The Accountant of the Financial Department. Two members of the municipality. Most of the relatives of those whose estates were under the superintendence of the Wards Department looked on the property as lost. No provision, was made for the education of minors, and the Department was accused of mismanagement and bribery. During the interval between the disappearance of the Turks and the establishment of our Courts, almost all the guardians took possession of the lands of minors under their care, and recovered the incomes themselves. The work of the Court of Mlards has included the investigation of claims against the Turkish Mudir, the examination of the accounts of guardians, the recovery of loans long overdue, and enquiry into the very numerous claims connected with the estates, which are an inheritance from the Turkish administration. Much good work has been done by the Court of Wards_ had it not been for the salutary limitation imposed by the Court of Ward Begulation (G.O.C. Reo-ulation No. 2 of 1915) which fetters the activity and interference of the Court in a manner unknown in Turkish days more might have been accomplished. But this very wholesome restraint is on the whole acceptable to the inhabitants of the country. Incidence of the Code. —As courts have been established nowhere in the occupied territories, except in Basra, the incidence of the Traq Code has hitherto been practically limited to the Basra district, save that the Basra Courts will summon a man from remoter localities to appear before them in a suit initiated at Basra.^ Outside the Basra district the decision in civil, as well as in criminal cases, is mainly in the hands of the Assistant Police Officers and Military Governors, and the law is defined by decrees promulgated in the areas. They make large recourse to the arbitration of local notables and religious men, and to settlement of cases by oath. Outside the immediate area of the towns most cases are referred by the disputants to the tribal authorities, Shaykhs and Saiyids, and are not brought to our cognisance. As in Basra, crime!is rare and is mainly robbery. Itiver theft is common. Murders are rare and are usually connected with tribal and personal blood~leuds.8 APPENDIX (B). Educational Measures in the Occupied Territories of Lower Mesopotamia. (By Miss Gertrude Bell.) Prior to the British occupation there were in the Basra vilayet two Turkish schools, one in Basra and one in the important suburb of ‘Ashar. The principal language taught was Turkish, Arabic being only a secondary language. The schools were very badly run and very expensive, head teachers receiving 150 rupees a month for instruction of two hours a day. The teachers were of bad. moral character, and the schools were hot-beds of vice, to which respectable Arabs hesitated to send their boys. The buildings were insanitary and dirty. Apart from the Mullahs’ classes, which taught only the knowledge of the Koran by rote, the total number of primary schools in the existing primary classes was less than 500 for the whole vilayet. There is thus no basis of primary education on which to found any form of middle or higher education, nor are there any available primary school teachers of good character and attainments, except two or three who are being turned out by the American Mission School. It was obvious from the character of the Turkish schools that no attempt could be made to maintain them or their staff. There was, however, a pressing need for educational establishments; in the first place because the Arab population was most anxious that the children should be given the opportunity of learning English, mainly because that language would be essential to a successful mercantile career ; and in the second place because it is of urgent necessity to provide educated Arab youths to enter the Government service, which must otherwise be filled by employes of a different race and language. It was therefore impossible to delay opening new primary schools until the requisite number of efficient primary school teachers of good family and moral character could be provided. There were in Basra two foreign schools, the American Mission School in the ‘Ashar suburbs and the Carmelite Fathers’ School in Basra itself. The American Mission School, presided over by the Bev. J. Van Ess, is the only school in Basra giving secondary education. It is devoted almost exclusively to the education of Arabs, no attempt at proselytising is made, and the only element of missionary teaching is the reading of the Gospels, to which no exception has ever been taken by the parents of Moslem children. The school contains 108 boys, including secondary and primary classes, and is run on a grant from the American Mission, supplemented by private subscriptions. To this school a grant-in-aid of 5,000 rupees per annum has been made by the British Government, in return for which Mr. Van Ess undertakes to provide for a normal class to teach methods of teaching, turning out three first class primary school teachers a year. He will also provide for the increase which he expects of ordinary secondary and primary scholars, sacrifice some of his most promising teachers for two new primary schools to be started by the British Govern ment, and give us to some extent the benefit of his supervision over them when first set on foot. He welcomes Government inspection of his own school. The following primary schools have been established under these auspices :— 1 . A school for boys in Basra. 2 . A school for girls in Basra directed by Mrs. Van Ess. 3 . A school in Abul Khasib, a town of 12,000 inhabitants on the right bank of the Tigris below Basra. It possessed a school in Turkish times, and is badly in need of one. The district is the richest on the Shatt-al-Arab. 4 . A school at Zubair. The demand here for facilities for learning English was particularly insistent. The population is of a good type, the pure desert Arab, with high standards and morals. The residents are many of them men of force of character and wealth, and have great influence upon the Arabs of the surrounding country. Men of this type have not hitherto been anxious for Government service, nor is it desirable to encourage them to look for it in the first instance. The people of Zubair are independent men of commercial instinct who are chiefly interested in trade, and for commercial purposes they are very anxious for education, especially for English education. An English teacher is attached to this school. On Mr. Van Ess’s advice it was agreed that the teaching given in these schools should be on the group system, i.e., the pupils are not arranged in classes but in groupsaccording to their efficiency in each separate subject of instruction. This system is more troublesome and expensive to work, and requires a larger staff, but has a much more stimulating effect upon the intelligence of the pupil. Arabic is the main medium of instruction, but English is taught even in the lowest classes ; if this were not done 'Tere would be no inducement to the parents to send their children to the Government schools rather than to the Mullahs’ classes, where instruction in Arabic can be obtained. A fee of 1 rupee a head is charged per month. Government inspection will not postulate any system of written examinations or of stereotyped standards, but will consist of a careful personal inspection and oral examinations. The teachers are given the comparatively high salary of 75 rupees a month; this is, however, considerably lower than that which was paid by the Turks to extremely inefficient persons; teachers knowing Arabic and English are hard to find; the cost of living and general standards are higher in Mesopotamia than in India, and it is essential to attract- to the primary schools teachers of ability and of good social status. The second foreign school which existed in Easra before the occupation was the Carmelite Fathers’ Elementary School for Oriental Catholics. It is most desirable to have Catholics educated separately from Moslems, and this is in accordance with the wishes of both sects. From Oriental Catholics the clerks hitherto employed by the Turks and in commercial firms have mainly been drawn, and however much we may encourage Moslem Arabs to enter our service it is to be feared that clerical duties in the offices will never be very popular with them, although they may be eager to take executive service when they realise how much larger are the powers which we grant to, Asiatic executive magistrates and subordinates than any which were granted by the Turks. We cannot afford to neglect the education of Oriental Christians since it is probable that clerical posts will mainly be filled by them. The principal teaching agency is that of the Carmelite Fathers, one of whom is an Englishman. The number of their pupils is about fifty, the principal language taught has been French, the education given is not so efficient or so well thought out as that of the American school, but it has turned out clerks sufficiently good for the work which has been asked of them. We have given a grant-in-aid of 1,500 rupees a year to the Carnielite School, the Fathers in return agreeing to Government inspection and making English the principal language taught. All the Latin Catholics in‘Ashar have joined together for educa tional purposes, and a girls’ school has been opened there under the auspices of the Carmelite Nuns. When the primary schools begin turping out a large number of boys with some knowledge of English and a good knowledge of Arabic, the question of middle and higher education must be decided, and we shall have to consider whether the reserve of educated youths thus created is not to be diverted mainly into the channels of commercial and technical education, so as to axoid tne evil of turning out a multitude of scholars endowed with imperfect literary education and fitted only for the lower grades of Government service and for the profession of pleader. A commercial school and a practical agricultural school might be found useful. APPENDIX (C). The Italian Press and Asia Minor. ( 1 .) The “Stampa” (18th August) prints a long article from its correspondent in Petrograd Virginio Gayda, urging that the Government should lose no time m coming to an understanding with the Allies on the question of Italy’s interests m the Balkans and Asia Minor. . , , , J ^ -n ■ He takes as his starting point (l) Mr. Asquiths statement to the Kussian repre sentatives when they visited London that between England ana Russia a perfect accord had been reached regarding Persia and the East generally, and ( 2 )^ “ the fact that at present (the article is dated August) there is said to be a resumption of exchange of views between the Allied Cabinets.” -p t? + On both occasions Italy seems to have been absent, and it looks as if the itastern10 question, in which Italy is so vitally interested, were to be settled without her direct participation. Italy’s war is not merely national, but also European; and for Italy, as for others, its solution must be European in scope. Her declaration of war on Turkey and Bulgaria meant that she claimed to be present in the solution of the Eastern question. The Eastern question is now open, and seems to be approaching solution. Italy is tlf~ ally of the Powers who opened it, and who are now about to solve it. She ought to have from her allies an explicit recognition of her Oriental interests. As regard the Balkans -it seems likely that Salonika will not be restored to Greece, but inter nationalised in the interest of all the countries of the Balkan hinterland and of the European countries. This idea, though not expressed, is diffused in many European capitals. The commercial and cultural effects of such an arrangement would be very great, and Italy must have her part in the matter. Then there is the question of the southern limits of the new Serbia, and finally of Constantinople and the Straits, and Bussia’s entry into the Mediterranean, which affects Italy as a Mediterranean Power. Gayda then goes in great detail into the question of Italy’s and the Allies’ interests, railway concessions, and spheres of influence in Asia Minor. Before the war the four Powers—England, Bussia, France, and Germany—had reached a definitive agreement by means of reciprocal concessions. This agreement is important because it provides a ready-made scheme for the new agreement under discussion among the Allies which is to substitute actual possession for concessions of influence in Asiatic Turkey— Germany’s share being apparently assigned to France. Italy came late to Asia Minor, and only obtained a conditional concession for preparatory work of the southern coast from the Gulf of Budrum as far as Adana. And even this was contested by her neighbours—by the Germans, who did not want to see Italy in Cilicia (in spite of the Triple Alliance), by the Austrians, and further by the English, who wished to keep Italy out of the Gulf of Budrum, and who talked of a plot on the part of the Triple Alliance to get command of the Eastern Mediterranean. It seemed that there was no place for Italy in Asia Minor while she formed part of the Triple Alliance. But now the position is changed. Italy has taken her part in the war, and has a right to her part in the settlement. England was very liberal in her offers to Greece earlier in the war ; and Italy ought surely to rank before Greece. The correspondent concludes by again urging that Italian troops should be sent to Salonika as a symbol of Italy’s interests in the Eastern question. An editorial note is appended to this article underlining the reference to Greece, and refusing to believe it possible that the Government of Salandra can have neglected in April 1915 to obtain guarantees for Italian interests in the East, or that the Allies can expect Italy to establish each of her claims by some fresh enterprise and fresh sacrifices. [Taken from the “ Daily Beview ” (W.O.) for the 25th August.] ( 2 -) On the 16th August the “Idea” returns to the question of “Italy’s Overseas’ Bights,” and amplifies and explains its case for an Italian Asia Minor :— \ K* ^ r ' # f Now that the Greek phantasm has once and for all been cleared out of the way, the colonial policies of Bussia, France, and England leave open to Italy the shores of Asia Minor. Bussia, having made sure of her zone in Persia, now concentrates all her efforts upon the conquest of Armenia ; indeed, so important does this zone seem to Bussia that in order to devote all her energies to this end, she has made vast concessions to Japan in the Far East. Again, it is obvious that England and Bussia have come to an understanding about the Straits. With the definite annexation of Egypt, England has realised what seemed to be but a fantastic dream : the mastery of the gates of the Eastern Mediterranean. Still greater are England’s triumphs in Arabia and Mesopotamia. With the revolt of the Arabs—an achieve ment obviously hers—England has now under her influence all the Arabian coast except the Yemen. She holds the best part of Mesopotamia, has blocked the Bagdad Bailway, and thus possesses the key to the other route to Asia ; whilst her occupation of Kerman consolidates her position and shields the frontier of India.These gains are worth more than all her sacrifices in the war. France has now more or less insured her future possession of Syria. Thus, the direction of our Allies’ activities has left untouched the southern part of Asia Minor; and there—from the Gulf of Smyrna to Alexandretta—a zone of influence remains for Italy. This zone falls naturally to Italy in compen sation for—but still more as a direct political consequence of—her allies’ gains. For all these gains injure Italy in varying degree : Russia’s opening of the Straits will add a further formidable Mediterranean competitor ; England’s annexation of Egypt cuts Italy off from her Red Sea colonies ; a French Syria will mean the cutting of the one other route to the East which could possibly compete with the Suez Canal and connect the Mediterranean with Mecca. This last point—'the absolute severance of all possible direct connection bet ween Italy and the centre of Islam—is worth emphasising, since it must not be said that Syria is too slight a compensation for France, and that Italy’s with drawal of all claim to the zone from Alexandretta to the Egyptian frontier is no great sacrifice The sole road—now that the Suez route is cut—-which can connect the Mediterranean with Arabia and the Red Sea will be the Hejaz railway^ with its branches to various places on the Syrian coast. Now we resign our claim to this connecting route in favour of France. But that is not all ; the Hejaz has long been an isolated province, and the Holy Places have therefore fallen under the influence of Egypt. The opening up of the Hejaz Railway will withdraw from Egyptian influence the centre of Mohammedanism, and will tend to transfer it to the influence of the owners of Syria and Lebanon. influence we also renounce, together with all other titles to Syria which for many years Italian settlers, and, above all, Italian religious foundations, have constituted^ But we do lay claim to the southern part of Asia Minor. Since our right to it cannot be gainsaid, its precise boundaries alone remain to be discussed. ^ (The “ Idea ” promises to point them out in a further article.) [Taken from the “ Daily Review” (W.O.) for the 25th August.] APPENDIX (D). Miscellaneous Cuttings fbom the Press. The Yeni-Turan Movement. [The following appeared in the “ Daily Telegraph” of August 24. It has also appeared in other papers.] A special correspondent of the Central News states . For some years a new movement has been noticeable m Turkey, known as “ Yem- ;' U raii ”—New Turan. Its object is to revive Turkish nationality at the expense ot he Moslem religion, and on this basis to unite in a general federation all the iurco- [artar and kindred races (Bulgarians included). Its promoters are hostile to Is am, on he ground that (so they say) Islam tends to destroy the feeling of nationality, and las prevented the formation of a “Turkish” civilisation: they want to make the Darkish national soul independent of Islam.” Islam, in fact, has no place in their wogrammeovement has both a literary and a political side. The former seeks, among ,ther things, to glorify the history of the Turanian races; Chingiz Khan is made a ero and f statesman by those who dream of restoring his empire. The political side mncerns the Arab race. Bitter hostility is shown to them. They are a “ misfortune hr Turkey; they must be Turkish ; their lands must become Turkish colonies; their Story and customs must be forgotten ; above all, their language must be forbidden nd replaced by Turkish. All this has been constantly advocated by Turkish nationalist writers’, Ld a Turk, preaching in Syria, has declared that the existence of the Prophet wrs &amp; fiction invented, by the ArBibs.l ;g!^g ^ g , • ' 1 ■ ' r 12 Yeni-Turan is worked by a society, subventioned by the State, known as “The Turkish Hearth,” and behind it are the Committee of Union and Progress, whose leading men are not Moslems in any sense. German Encouragement. The movement is, of course, encouraged eagerly by Turkey’s German taskmasters. Since Germany discovered that it was impossible to seduce from their allegiance the great Moslem populations embraced in the Empires of Prance and Britain, her enthusism for Islam has cooled remarkably ; while the world now knows ^thanks to the capture by General Smuts, at Moshi, of the famous circular addressed by the German Government to its colonial agents) that all the time Germany was seeking to destroy the Moslem religion in her late African colonies. . . , Islam has done much for the world ; but the Turanian races, ap their history shows, have done nothing but destroy. They have never created anything ; but where they have passed they have not only, time after time, destroyed civilisation and its works, but have debased and degraded their subject races by the most abominable methods. The Neo-Turanian idea that Islam has prevented the formation of a lurkish civilisation is not true. Ottoman civilisation is certainly only a patchwork borrowed from Arabia Persia, Byzantium ; but then these Turanian peoples who are not Moslems have created no civilisation either, but borrowed from China. Islam is the one thing that has held the Ottoman patchwork together. The Turk can still only destroy , he has massacred the Armenians because they (he thought) stood in the way of his jommg hands with the Turki peoples of Azerbaijan and the Caucasus, and m Yem- l uran he has a deliberate programme for the destruction of Arab nationality. But that is a subject on which both the Arabs and the Allies will have a good deal to say. Progress of the Arab Movement. A brilliant success for the Arab movement for independence' appears to be close at hand. It is semi-officially announced that diplomatic agents^ of the feherif will shortly be appointed in those countries in which Arabia has special interests. Indeed, the Sberif’s agent at Cairo, Omar Bey El Farouky, is already practically recognised as such ; and it is said that very shortly the Sherifs flag will fly over his residence, which was taken only a few weeks ago. Omar Bey belongs to one ot the noblest families of It Irak. He is young, energetic, and enlightened, and achieved distinction as an officer of the Turkish Army before he left to realise the dream of his life. He belongs to the secret Reform Committee of Arab Officers, and has played a leading part in the present great movement in Arabia. •. j i j The following facts, simple in themselves, serve to throw into relief, and lend practical significance to the momentous announcement made lately by the British Government in regard to Arabia. The Egyptian Postal Administration has notified the public that correspondence from the Hejaz, even though not bearing any stamps, may be delivered to the addressees if it simply bears the mark denoting that it has been sent through the Hejaz Post Office. As a matter of fact, the Sherifs Government has decided temporarily to stamp all correspondence emanating from the Hejaz with the letters T. SH., to indicate that it has passed through the Hejaz Post Office—this pending the new issue of Hejaz stamps, which have been ordered m Europe. It will interest philatelists to know that the issue consists of two series, one of 1 piastre, sky-blue in colour, and the other of half a piastre, red in colour. In the middle of the stamp are inscribed the words “ Mecca the Honoured,” and at the top, “ Hejaz Post,” while on the two sides figure the date of the current Arab year. Thus, the incredulous pro-Turk and they are still legion over here will soon have a concrete proof of the existence of an independent Arab State.

The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 21 st August [Baba 50] that ( 1 ) Sherif AH had been ioined by Nuri Bey Es-Shaalan with maxims, mountain guns, and Arab reinforcements from Mecca.

The Proclamation. It was noted in Arabian Report N.S. V that Sir H. McMahon had reported that the Sherif continued to urge the desirability of publishing his original proclamation in Ecypt and that he stated that copies of it had already been sent to India. On the 16th August, Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed [P. 3278] to the Viceroy asking for his V10W ()n the 22 nil August the Foreign Office telegraphed [No. 687] to Sir H. McMahon, in reply to his telegram [No. 695] of the 14th August, that there was no objection to the original proclamation being published m Egypt. . ^geographical position, is the obvious person to be chosen as its head, the matter has^ two sides : political and religious; as it would appear to be desired that the bherit should enjoy a status in regard to Islam similar to that enjoyed by the first caliphs. It must, therefore* be considered under each heading separately. (a.) Political. —The object of a political union I understand to be the advantages resulting from dealing on large questions with a central authority rather than with several chiefs separated from one another by great distances, particularly in view of the desirability of keeping out other foreign influence. But we have yet to define the extent to which the foreign affairs of each chief are to remain in his own hands, and it will be found that this is an extremely difficult question in cases of strong and independent personalities, such as Bin Baud, the ruler of Nejd. I notice that he has written to the Sherif placing his services at his disposal, but knowing the man and his love for isolation and independence, I imagine that this means nothing more than an offer of help in the present crisis ; and we have Idrisi reported on the 3rd July as having accepted the suzerainty of the Sherif, and a month later.holding out with great tenacity ^ over the question of Comfida. The fact is that there are several sheikhs of importance who will probably be ready to join him in a combined .effort to obtain release Bom Turkish misrule, but who would resent deeply any proposal that a part of their independence should be surrendered, however delicately it might be put before them. Moreover, as Mr. Carruthers points out, Arabia abounds with tribal jealousies and family feuds, these are of such importance to the parties concerned that they would at best only he laid aside temporarily for the attainment of a common purpose, itven it a national spirit is growing among Arabs, there are obstacles m the national character which will take years to overcome. For these reasons I am doubtful of success m this nroiect from the political side at present. . . . p (b.) Religions. —We cannot be too careful to remember that this is no concern ours, and that any public support by us of the Sherif m the assumption yy un ^ ^ title of Caliph would do us infinite harm besides ruining his chances. I notice that the Sherif makes no claim in his proclamation, but should he proclaim himse a ip a ei we should express neither approval nor disapproval but merely continue to supper i foliticn attitude W-J'the Turks according to our pdertafangs Noth ln g is more important than that the question of the Caliphate be left enti e &gt; Ti &gt;nrMt should receive no public attention from us, at least, until we are a—hed by a large aXepresenhtive body of Moslems.

Perhaps the history of the enmity existing hetweenthe first-named Shaykhs was not sufficiently considered when instructions wereSKIP m- t 4 issued to Sir P. Cox to bring about a rapprochement between them. Each claims territory actually in the possession of the other, and it is for this reason that the hostilities will probably have no termination until one or the other has attained his object. Considerable feeling also exists in Koweit on this subject, as Bin Bashid and the Shammar have committed various acts of aggression against Koweites during the past few years, for none of which compensation has been obtained. Hence the efforts made by us to establish good relations with Bin Bashid were not looked upon with complete favour by Shaykh Jabin and his people. It would appear from the records that Bin Saud has a strong claim to the possession of Hail and its neighbourhood, strong enough, in my opinion, to enable us to support his cause. The Shammar were greatly delighted at the death of Captain Shakespear in battle with them—he was not fighting—and Bin Bashid has recently declared himself openly to be on the side of the Turks, and to be only waiting for their aid to attack us. I suggest that it is desirable to support Bin Saud against him. Bin Saud’s feelings towards us are too well known to need description here. It may, perhaps, be thought that with the possession of Hail he would become too powerful, but I am not of that opinion, knowing the man and his views. 3 . General treatment of Arab Chiefs. Experience shows that some difference of opinion exists in regard to the extent to which a Political Officer should interfere in the internal concerns of an Arab State, and the line which his interference, if any, should take ; I therefore venture to state my views. I have never had any difficulty in obtaining control of the foreign relations, neither has any of importance been experienced by me in regard to matters between the ruler and His Majesty’s Government; but any control in local and tribal matters can only be acquired very gradually and unobtru sively. It will generally be found that a Chief will resent at once any attempt to interfere by a new Political Officer in local affairs, and that he will pointedly reject all suggestions. This attitude should be treated with unconcern by the Political Officer when possible and sympathised with when necessary ; it will gradually disappear with the increase of affection for and confidence in him on the part of the Chief, and he will find sooner or later, provided that he exercises sufficient patience and tact (with a complete absence of patronage), that his advice will be asked more and more frequently, probably on the very points upon which it had been formerly treated with disdain. HOWEIT AND THE TBUCIAL COAST. From two telegrams sent to the Foreign Office by Sir H. McMahon [Nos. 682 and 699], it appears that, on or about the 11 th August, Sir Percy Cox telegraphed to Simla that the Shaykhs of Koweit and Mohammerah had sent him letters addressed to the Sherif, with a request that they should be forwarded to their destination. These letters merely expressed the loyalty of the writers to the Sherif, with congratulations on what he had already achieved and prayers for the further success of his efforts. Sir Percy Cox asked permission to forward these to Sir H. McMahon for transmission to the Sherif. MASKAT. [Nil.] BAHBEIN. [Nil.] PART II. POLITICAL NOTES FROM THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS.

The Treachery of the Emir of Mecca. [Article published in the “ Berliner Tageblatt ” of the 8 th August, 1916.] Up to the present, the defection of the former Emir of Mecca, tlussein Pasha, has been wrapped in mystery. The newspapers announced on the 2 nd July that the first Vice-President of the Senate, Sherif Ali Haidar, had been created Emir of Mecca, and the public was informed at the same time that the deposition of Hussein Pasha had become a necessity. According to information which they have received from mysterious “reliable sources,” 'pro-Entente circles in Pera, and circles hostile to the Committee in Stamboul, state that the English had landed a considerable army in Jeddah, the port of Mecca, and that Medina and Taif were in the hands o? the apostate Emir. There appeared to be a violent rising of all the Arabian tribes, which threatened the Turkish Syrian army seriously on its flank. The impression was produced that a general rising of Syrian Arabs was to be expected, and for this new misfortune which threatened Turkey a hypocritical regret was expressed. No one who knows the conditions in Arabia can be deceived by these reports. It is well known that the two powerful neighbours of the Emir of Mecca on the east, Imam Jachja and Ibn Baschid, are faithful to the Turks, as are also'the Arabs of Southern Arabia, the so-called Hadramaut. The twelve brave Germans who landed in Southern Arabia a few months ago from their small cutter “ Weddigen ’ were received with friendliness by the Bedouins, and treated as guests of honour. It was only beyond Jeddah, amongst the Bedouins in the pay of England, that their tragic late overtook them. The Turkish troops before Aden are reinforced by soldiers of Imam Jachja, and Ibu Baschid Pasha, whose power extends to Mesopotamia, dealt the English, on whose side his deadly enemy, Ibn Sand, is. fighting, a considerable blow between Basra and Subeir. On this account he was granted the title ol General Commander-in- Chief of the tro &gt;ps and volunteers in that district by the Sultan, who presented him also with two orders. _ _ &gt; . Hence the report that all the tribes of Arabia have risen in revolt against lurkey is a fiction. Even the news that the former Emir Hussein Pasha has comp to an agree ment with his southern neighbour. Seid Idris, is not entirely reliable. It is true that Seid Idris, the Lord of Assir, is making common cause with the enemies of Turkey as he did in the Tripoli war—but there exists an ancient enmity between him and Hussein Pasha. And in any case, whether a reconciliation has taken place or not, it signifies no increase of danger. , . . , Ll , j_i In spite of the unreliability of the above reports, it is reassuring to know that the Turkish Government has decided to publish a detailed account of the troubles in Mecca. The contents of the -statement published in the “ Tamn ^ have been already telegraphed to foreign papers. Some complementary information which I have received from reliable sources may be of interest. . . The “ Tanin ” emphasises the fact that the behaviour of the deposed Emir since the beginning of the war has been suspicious. In point of fact, though the Holy War ” was announced with great solemnity in Stamboul, Damascus, and Keibela, m Mecca itself- which, as the “ Holy City,” should have been the first to receive it—no such proclamation was made. /&gt; tt • The organ of Young Turkey states that English money was the cause of Hussein Pasha’s silence ; but it also points out that the English are able to bring pressuie to bear upon him by the fact that they have the coasts of the Bed Sea and all its commerce m their power. England pays for the Emir of Mecca’s neutrality by allowing t le supply of provisions to Jeddah. It appears that some of the provisions landed there found t heir wav via Medina to Syria, and that the English were principally concerned to prevent a delivery of provisions to the Turks. If this version is correct, then a definite split between Stamboul and Mecca, contrary to the interests of the English, who prner to carry on their intrigues m secret, occurred when Hussein Pasha attempted to maxe the Turks waive their claim to the provisions landed in Jeddah. [898 — 4] - D/ 11 ( 8 ) It is, however, quite certain that the English suddenly changed their course in June. According to the Turkish war reports they had been bombarding the ports on the Red Sea, especially the mosques and mausoleums, without military purposes. A bombardment of the town of Jeddah was also announced. During this bombardment Hussein Pasha wired to the Turkish Government demanding that his office should be made hereditary. If the English wished to force the Emir to a decisive step by the bombardment, they had succeeded) on the other hand, it is more probable that the bombardment was arranged between the Emir and the English, to supply an excuse for the withdrawal of the Turkish garrison from Jeddah. Hussein Pasha was, of course, perfectly well aware that the Government of Stamboul could not make his office hereditary. The giving of the office of Emir is a privilege of the Turkish Sultan, who has also the right to withdraw it if required. It is a condition that the Emir should be in direct descent from the Prophet. By the nomination of the present Emir the office returns to the line of Synch There is no apparent connection between the fall of Hussein Pasha and the execution of Arabs at Damascus. It is true tha.t Hussein Pasha sent one of his sons to the well-known Arab congress in Constantinople, in the spring of 1914, but he appears not to have been concerned in the treasonable intrigues in Syria which have now been justly punished. A publication, which is shortly to appear, consisting of important documents found in the French consulates at Beyrout and Damascus, will give further information of the intrigues of the French and English in Syria, and demonstrate the guilt of the Arabs who were executed. The energy of Dschemal Pasha saved Syria from dangerous revolts, and it is to be hoped that his troops will soon conduct the new Emir to Mecca. [From the “ Daily Review of the Foreign Press” (W.O.), 17th August, 191G.] 2. The Sherifs Reforms. While pressing on with military operations, the Sherif of Mecca is working aho on administrative reform. Ridding Arabia of the Turk is for him not the sole aim, but rather a means to an end, which is the establishment of order and security, and the leading of the people along the higher path of moral and material progress. Here, as in other parts of the Empire, the presence of the Turk has so far been a stumbling-block in the way of such progress. Arabia is in need of a great leader and reformer, and the Sherif seems to have realised that military success alone may not entitle him to this high position, and that collateral achievements in the domain of administrative and social reform are calculated to secure the support of hesitating admirers. He has just founded in Mecca a paper bearing the appropriate name of £ 'A1 Kibla*—the Polar Star, so to speak, of Moslems. This may serve not only as a public record x&gt;f the Sherifs doings for the welfare of the Arabs and Arabia, but also as an organ for the dissemination of his political, religious, and social views. In Jeddah the task of administrative reorganisation has already been started. Enlightened doctors and custom-house officials, some ot them Christians, have been appointed. In Mecca itself, whose soil is sacrosanct, and where only Moslems may be admitted, the recruiting of the personnel destined to carry on the work of reorganisation will take more time. Egypt and Syria, however, can supply a sufficient number ot enlightened Moslems of modern education to fill the posts ; and now that the pacification of the country is likely to proceed apace, thanks to the fall of the last important port on the Hejaz coast—-viz., Yambo, the port of Medina—we may expect this serious problem to be tackled and solved ere very long. An official communique has just been published here, declaring that postal communications between Egypt and the Hejaz have been re-established. [From the Cairo correspondence of the “Near East,” 18th August, 1916.] 3. News from Hungary. A correspondent of the “Morning Post,” in a communication dated Buda-Pesth, 9th August, after dealing with the operations in the Carpathians and the lurco- German reinforcements, says :— “The Turkish soldiers in their conversations with journalists always talk of the Peninsula and the fine fighting and fairness of the English and Colonial troops The Near East ” says that this will be edited by Fuad Effendi Khatib, late lecturer in Arabic literature at Gordon College. to who: of i» te every] At all majorh either The revolt in powerful of years, can he a to Divine their pro masters £ their pos without Hejaz o: hold ovi dispensa indepem is not a gain tin consider cousidei in purs eventui have e: t the Tu the oul hifficul paid i Const; the “' he del their e Tbr over' that so Hod’ oftto whom they were opposed there. At least twenty articles containing accounts of interviews with Turkish officers have appeared in the Hungarian press, and in every case the story was the same—that the English were fine and noble enemies. At all these interviews English was spoken, for the Turkish officers, at least the majority of them, prefer to speak English rather than German, a language very few of them understand.”—[“Morning Post,” August 18, 1916.] APPENDIX B. The Arab Bevolt. Extracts from Indian Newspapers. I.—Punjab. 1. Moslem Papers. The “Paisa Akhbar ” (Lahore), of the 30th June, 1916, tries to show that me revolt in Arabia will succeed if it has been decreed bv God. The establishment ^oi a powerful Ottoman Empire and the continuance of Turkish rule in Europe for huncuec^ of years, as well as the Ottoman custody of the sacred places of Islam and Christianitv, can be ascribed to two causes—partly to the Turks’ own strength of arms and partly to Divine dispensation. But if the Turks cease to hi sufficiently strong to safeguarc their property from their enemies and if God does not will that they should remain t masters and custodians of the sacred places, no power can help them in maintaining their position. Those who believe in the Koranic tenet that not anatom can move without God’s command will not credit the possibility of the Turks ceasing to rule the Hejaz or any other land contrary to the will of God. Indeed, if the Turks lose t rm hold over the Heiaz, people will believe that this is the result of the v\i l ay dispensation of God. If, on the other hand, the Arabs do not succeed m their independence, this, too, will be ascribed to the will of God. “ Arabia ioi the ona s is not a new idea, whether the Arabs desire it themselves or other people help them o gain their own ends. However, these are points which the Turks should have .u y considered before embarking upon the war. It is possible that they may have considered the matter and that Enver Pasha’s last tour in the Heiaz may have bee. in pursuance of this very object. If, then, the, Turks were not prepared for all eventualities it is difficult to see why they came into the war. But now that , have entered the lists, they and the Islamic world should be prepared to face the consequences of their action. No doubt many Mahommedans .U ' 1 'pUpg the Turks in their present misfortune, but they shouffi bear in mind that when Defore the outbreak of the war Indian Mahommedans urged the lurks not to place them . difficulties by participating in the war the latter heeded only own inl and naid no attention to the telegrams sent from India to the furhish Pieimer in Constantinople nor to the articles which appeared in the Indian newspapers, including the “ Paisa Akhbar which printed a series of four or five articles to show that it »omi be detrhnentel to Turkish interests to join the war. Now if Arabia passes away from their hands, Indian Mahommedans should consider t he r ^‘°“ h ^ e f^ e t ^ equanimity, and should paper over to whomsoever he wills. Having quoted some vei e whenever concludes bv remarking that verily God is the master of a country, and that whenever t^ft country na“ses away from the possession of a person it must be held that God that country pas y ^ lncumbent on Mohammedans to resign themselves to GoTs will Many Indian Mahommedans will disapprove of the Arabs’ bad treatment of the Turks and J of their rebelliousness; because they know that the Arabs wi.cmy , i j-j H&lt;’iaz If Turkish rule was characterised by defects, Arab ime “e worse Even now the Arabs are responsible for the existing mismanagement m the Hejaz to a greater extent than the Turks. The “ Paisa Akhbar ” (Lahore) of the 5th July, 1916, in a I yyV “[J^yb'lish I Arabia, says that the present is the best opportunity for the Arabs to establish( 10 ) permanent national government in their country. Turkey is engaged m a hfe-and-death struggle in Mesopotamia and Asia Minor, and the Arabs know full well that she can send no reinforcements to the Hejaz just now. She could do so only by the Hejaz railway, but the stations on that line to a distance of 100 ^ miles from Medina are reported to have been destroyed by the Sherd. And even if the Turks manage to collect troops they wdl find it difficult to bring them to Medina. Again, although Medina is a fortified city there is no hope of reinforcements to the Turkish army besieged there reaching the place soon, or indeed at all, even if it is supposed that the besieged are sufficiently numerous and have sufficient provisions with them. The paper then goes on to say that the Turks are both to blame and blameless in the revolt. During the 400 years of their rule in Arabia they have never been able completely to subjugate the Arabs, while it has become the second nature of the latter to obey no one but the chiefs of their tribes. As to these chiefs, they obey the Sherif of Mecca for two reasons—firstly, owing to his being a direct descendant of the Prophet, and secondly because the Arab clans have always recognised the chiefs of his family as their head. Nor is this all. The Sherif already occupies in Arabia a position in no way inferior to that of a k ng, and was under the Sultan of 1 urkey only in name. The “Vakil” (Amritsar), of the 1 st July, 1916, having printed a short historic retrospect of Arabia in the XVIIth, XVIIIth, and the earlier part of the XIXth centuries, adds that after many vicis situdes Turkey at last gained a footing in Arabia and the custody of the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. There was, however, no love lost between the Turks and the Arabs ; nevertheless, the power of the Turks and the Sultan’s position as Caliph secured for them the greatest respect all over the world. The Sherif of Mecca, hitherto a servant of the Sultan, could not muster courage to rise against his master. But it is undeniable that adverse forces, though quiescent, were alwavs in existence. It will not be strange if the Turkish Government loses its spiritual prestige after these events. Nor will it be surprising if the crown of the Caliphate is seized from the Ottoman dynasty and placed on the head of the Sherif of Mecca. This will, in other words, mean that the succession to the Caliphate, before whose greatness the Powers of the East and the West trembled like the willow, will be now conferred on the unworthy shoulders of one who will be a mere puppet in the hands of others. In these circumstances, we consider the resolution of the All-India Moslem League and the decision of the public meeting of Lucknow, as also the telegram sent by Maulana Abdul Bari to the Viceroy, to be a correct expression of the views of the Mahommedan world. AVe also fully understand the significance of the adverse opinion expressed by a few Mahommedans of Calcutta, Khan Bahadur AValji Lalji, of Madras, the ulema of Egypt, and the students of the Jama-i-Azhar. We are also not ignorant of the true significance of the hope expressed by Mahommed Quddus Badshah, of Madras, that with the guidance of the British the Sherif of Mecca will render magnificent services to Islam. We also realise the importance of the views expressed by an Anglo-Indian newspaper, which says that, so far as the sacred places are concerned, the British Government has already announced that it will protect them from external aggression. There can be no doubt that the Sherif of Mecca is* destroying the railway stations of the Llejaz railway and is cutting the wires, and has also organised, with surprising rapidity, three armies, and has stationed them at different places. But we hope that if the Turks make an attempt to suppress the Arab rebellion the British Government will not interfere, because the Turks will fight, not against the sacred places, but with the rebels. As it is the duty of every Government to punish rebels properly, other Powers should not place obstacles in their way if the Turks perform their duty of suppressing rebellion. Besides, this is not a matter wherein the Governor of a province has rebelled against duly constituted authority. I he subject is connected with important question of the Caliphate of Islam, in which no one except Mahommedans is interested. The British Government will act wisely on the present occasion and will not be misled by the misleading views of some persons in Calcutta, Madras, and other places, so as to misunderstand the situation or act in a manner opposed to the views of the Moslem public. 2. Hindu Papers. 1 he “ Desh ” (Lahore) publishes a number of notes and articles on the declaration of Arab independence. In its issue of the 25th June it prints the news of the declaration, and says that the liberation of Arabia has undoubtedly caused great injury to the Turkish Government. The foolishness of the Turks is responsible for this. In its issueof the 27th June, 1916, the paper says that if the Sherif succeeds in establishing his independence the Sultan of Turkey will assuredly lose his claim to the Caliphate of Islam. The position of the Sherif appears to be a strong one, and this is the third loss which Turkey has suffered since her alliance with Germany. She has already lost Cyprus and Egypt. The “ Desh ” of the 28th June, 1916, refers to the news from Calcutta that there is general rejoicing in Moslem circles over Arabian independence. Indeed, Mahommedans should realise that since the Young Turks have assumed the administration of Turkey pilgrimage to the Hejaz has become a dangerous enterprise, and pilgrims have been plundered at the instance of the Turkish authorities at Mecca and Jeddah. It may be now expected that the Arabs will be able to protect the pilgrims properly with the help of the British. Many Mahommedans in India are rejoicing over the attempt of the Arabs to throw off the Turkish yoke. The “ Desh ” of the 30th June, 1916, states that some Mahommedans deplore the Sherif s proclamation and characterise his action as rebellious. The Mahommedans of Lucknow held a meeting on the 27th June to consider how far the protection of the sacred places of Islam will be endangered by the Sherif s rebellion. It remains to be seen what view of the situation is taken at the meeting. The Mahommedans of Calcutta, however, are rejoicing over the Sherifs proclamation, and are saying that the Arabs have a natural right to independence. In its issue of the 1 st July, 1916, the paper says that the Mahommedans, not only in Arabia but in several Indian provinces, are glad that the Sherif has declared Arabian independence. K. B. Walji Lalji, a prominent Mussulman of Madras, declares that the news has been received with satisfaction by the Mahommedans of Madras. Indeed, many Indian Mahommedans, who formerly used to sympathise with the Turks, are now regarding them with abhorrence. The “ Panjabee ” (Lahore), of the 4th July, 1916, reproduces the remarks of the Englishman” regarding the resolution of the All-India Moslem League on the declaration of Arab independence, and observes :— “ As this is a matter which concerns only the Moslem community, we entirely agree with a Calcutta contemporary that it is no part of our business either to applaud or to condemn expressions of Mahommedan opinion either in the press or at public meetings. An attitude of aloofness is what befits other communities in a matter which clearly does not concern them.” Writing about the Lucknow meeting, the Urdu “Bulletin” (Lahore) of the 5 th July, 1916, remarks that Indians should feel pleased at the Arab independence, although ’it has been proclaimed at a distance of hundreds of miles from India. It is, however, surprising to see that Indian Mahommedans, so far from feeling glad at the event, are expressing sorrow and indignation at the conduct of the Arabs. 3. Sikh Papers. The “ Hindustan ” (Lahore), of the 5th July, 1916, publishes a note headed “ Independent Arabia,” in which it says that the Sherifs army hap demolished stations on the 1 Hejaz Bailway for a distance of 100 miles, wrecking the line at the same time. To tell the truth it is this railway which has brought about the revolt of the Arabs; seeino- that it has thrown out of employment as many as 180,000 Bedouins, whose livelihood depends only on carrying pilgrims from Jeddah to Mecca, from the latter place to Medina, and thence to Damascus. This was why some years back they did not allow the Turks to proceed with the section of the Hejaz Bailway proposed to be constructed between Mecca and Medina. In another place the paper quotes an extract from the Paisa Akhbar disapproving of the conduct of the Arabs in rebelling against Turkey, and says that it is surprising that those who rejoice over the independence of every other nation should feel offended at the independence of the Arabs. The present war is being waged to restore their liberty to the weaker nations, and Bussia and Great Britain joined in it only to preserve the independence of Serbia and Belgium. Again, it has also been decided to confer Home Buie on Ireland, while Egypt has freed herself from the clutches of Turkey And if the Arabs have now secured their natural right, why should anyone feel ofiended at it ? Are the Arabs, who once ruled half the world, now unfit to administer their owncountry and throw off the Turlnsh yoke ? Elsewhere the paper re.ers to the meeting of the Lucknow Mahommedans, at which abhorrence was expressed at the conduct of the Sherif, and says that in all probability this opinion is entertained by only a few particular Moslem residents of Lucknow, and that even these will have o change their views after pondering over the real facts. It is difficult to understand why the Mahommedans in any other country should take umbrage at the independence of the Arabs. The Arabs can achieve greater progress if they are a fiee people than by continuing as the slaves of Turkey. XI.—United Provinces. 1. Moslem Papers. The “ Indian Daily Telegraph” (Lucknow) of the 29th June, 1916, contains an account of the proceedings of a largely attended Mahommedan meeting at Lucknow on the 27th June to discuss the Arab revolt. Mr. Saiyid Nabi-ullah, barrister-at-law, who presided, pointed out the deep anxiety and alarm which had been caused among Mahommedans bv the reports of the Arab outbreak in the Hejaz. I he first resolution was moved by Maulvi JNlizam-ud-dm Hasan, seconded by Mr. Muhammad Nasim, advocate, and supported by Hakim Abdul Qavi and Mr. Mumtaz Husain, barrister-at- law. The resolution recorded the deep abhorrence and indignation of the Mahommedans of Lucknow at the reported detestable conduct of the Arab rebels, endangering the safety and sanctity of the Holy Places of the Hejaz and Mesopotamia. The resolution condemned the Arab rebels and their sympathisers as enemies of Islam. The speakers dwelt on the unique sanctity of the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina and laid emphasis on the sacred Islamic injunction which declared these places to be Dar-ul-Aman or the “ Abodes of peace.” They condemned the action of the rebels, who had let loose all the sanguinary horrors of war around their holiest shrines. I hey said a true Mussulman could only look with detestation on these happenings, as long as he remembered^ his supreme duty to preserve the House of God and the tomb of the holy Prophet from desecration and outrage. The second resolution was moved by Mr. Shahid Husain, seconded by the Honourable Mr. Saiyid Wazir Hasan and supported by Mr. Saiyid Zahur Ahmad and Dr. Nasir-ud- din Hasan. This resolution repudiated the suggestion contained in a Calcutta telegram that any class of Mahommedans can be delighted with the reported Arab rebellion or can view with any feeling other than alarm and disgust the consequences likely to ensue^ therefrom. Mr. Shahid Husain, in the course of his speech, referred to the loyalty of Indian Mahommedans to the British Government, He said that the Arab revolt in the Hejaz was to Mahommedans a purely religious question, as it involved the safety and sanctity of their Holy Places. This question and the equally important one of the Caliphate touched them most deeply, and they could not tolerate any gratuitous suggestion or advice in regard to them. The other speakers denounced the attempt recently made to show that the Mahommedans welcomed the news of the revolt and characterised it as mischievous and misleading. The “ Indian Daily Telegraph ” further says that information has been received from Maulvi Salamat Ullah Sahib, secretary, Majlis Alia Anjuman-i-Khuddam-i-Kaaba that “ the Mahommedans repudiate in the most emphatic manner the suggestion that any guidance or assistance by the British Government in the affairs of the Hejaz will be welcome to them ; and consider it imperative in the interests of the Government that it should be apprised of the fact that even the contemplation of a contingency of an un-Islamic protectorate would be repugnant and most painful to them, being wholly opposed to the principles of Islam.” The Nizam-ul-Mulk ” (Moradabad) of the 30th June, 1916, refers to the reported Arab revolt and remarks that every Mahommedan will be perturbed at hearing the news. He asks his Indian co-religionists to exercise patience and to entertain the hope that the British Government will find some way to remove the unrest among Mahommedans. In “ A1 Khalil” (Bijnor) of the 1 st July, 1916 (received on the 5th July), the editor says that it is a matter of the greatest pride to Indian Mahommedans that theyconsidered their loyalty to their king to be their paramount religious duty. They looked upon the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and Turkey as an act of purely political^ significance, and from that point of view they expressed their regret at the action of the Ottoman Government. The only thing that did make them uneasy and anxious was the apprehension lest the war should lead to a violation of the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam. This fear was, however, put at rest by the declaration of the British Government and her Allies to respect the sacred ness of those places. The peace of mind of Indian Mahommedans has once again been seriously disturbed by the news of the Arab revolt, which means that the Sherif of Mecca turned traitor to the Sultan and broke the vow of fealty. The news of the Arab revolt should not have been allowed publication in India. Being at war with Turkey it will be only natural for the British Government to receive the news with satisfaction. He affirms that the uneasiness at the news is due merely to religious sentiments because the act of the Sherif will discredit Islam. The Mahommedan world wishes the sanctity of its sacred places to be respected. He goes on to say that the end of the revolt can be foreseen and it has no greater significance than that of a local disturbance. The attention of the Turks may for a time be diverted but they will easily overcome the Sherif. He observes that though all anti-German countries will welcome the news of the Arab revolt yet it should not be imagined that the British Government has had any hand in the matter. The British Government has always shown great consideration for the feelings of its Mahommedan subjects, and it should be correctly informed of the feelings of Indian Moslems in the matter. In the “ Bohilkhand Gazette” (Bareilly) of the 1 st July, 1916, the editor expresses indignation at the Arab revolt. He views with disapprobation the action of the Sherif of Mecca in causing human slaughter within the precints of Mecca, where even the killing of animals is prohibited. He says that the news of the Arab revolt has caused a sensation among Indian Mahommedans and has filled their hearts with indignation and contempt. He asserts that it is a violation of shariat, and for this reason every Mahommedan looks upon the Sherif and his supporters as the enemies of Islam. He is sanguine that the Ottoman Government will easily put down the revolt. He discredits the report that some Mahommedans have welcomed the news, and says that if the report is correct no importance should be attached to their attitude. In the “ Nai Roshni” (Allahabad! of the 2 nd July, 1916, the editor refers to the comment of the “ Leader ” (Allahabad) on the Arab revolt and says that in suggesting that the Arabs should seek the protection of the British m maintaining _ their independence, the “Leader” has made an indirect attempt to create suspicion m the minds of Indian Mahommedans that Britain was secretly in intrigue with the Arabs. He invites attention to the fact that ever since the outbreak of the war Government has, by declaring that the sanctity of the sacred places of Islam will be respected, tried to prevent the growth of such suspicions m the minds of the Moslems of He urges Government to warn the “ Leader not to mar the noble policy of Government by irrelevant and uncalled for expressions of loyalty. A correspondent who signs himself “ M.M.” writes from Dharmpur to the Indian Daily Telegraph” (Lucknow) of the 4th July, 1916 on the subject of the Arab revolt. The writer says that he is glad to hear that the Lucknow Moslems are perturbed at the news^of r ®™J t J. he rebek cannot be regarded as good Moslems He says that what he is afraid of is that this is the beginning of the Egyptian Caliphate, and that the outside world is responsible for the revolt. He asks his co-religiomsts m India o beg Government to keep strictly loyal to its announcement that the Holy Places would not be interfered witk ^ ^ ^ ^ of Moslemg to ask Government “to influence the situation” Is Moslems cannot suffer the humiliation of seeing the Holy Places m the protection of non-Moslems, including the Bntis .n i W ' V. ( 14 ) The “Nai Roshni” (Allahabad) of the 7 th July, 1916, notes with gratification the Moslem League’s expression of indignation at the Arab revolt, and remarks that from the attitude of Indian Moslems in the matter and their action in boldly giving expression to their feelings, it is manifsst that though Islam may be a slumbering lion in worldly affairs, yet it is wakeful as ever in religious matters. The editor says that as long as no danger threatened Islam (Indian) Mahommedans gave no thought to the doings of the Turks, and regarded with regret the act of the Turks in alienating the sympathies of the British Government. The Arab revolt is calculated to have a deep effect on the future of Islam. Mahommedans of all parts of India have expressed their indignation at the action of the rebels. He remarks that the degeneration of Mahommedans was due to the laxity of their religious belief, and he is glad to note that now Mahommedans are holding fast the “ rope of God even if they are hanged by it.” 2. Hindu Ta'pers. The “Leader” (Allahabad) of the 29th June. 1916, comments on the meeting of the council of the All-India Moslem League held recently at Lucknow at which a resolution was passed expressing abhorrence at the action of the Arab rebels and condemning them as enemies of Islam. The editor says that it is clear that the Grand Sherif and the Arabs by whom he is supported are not hostile to the British, and consequently “ may rely upon British support for the maintenance of their independence.” He says that it is not clear how the sanctity of sacred places has been placed in jeopardy by the action of the Arabs and how these and their “ sympathisers ” are the enemies of Islam. The “ Anand ” (Lucknow) of the 1 st July, 1916 (received on the 5th July), refers to the Arab revolt, and says that the inhabitants of Syria |and Mesopotamia and the educated Egyptians are gratified at the news of the revolt. The editor observes that some of the Indian Mahommedans, the All-India Moslem League, and other Moslem societies, have protested against the action of the Grand Sherif on religious grounds. He remarks that the Egyptian Mahommedans do not see any harm to Mahommedanism at the proclamation of independence by the Grand Sherif, while the Indian Moslems consider his action to be injurious to their religion. He wonders why the Indian Mahommedans make such undesirable protests, and remarks that they regard even the sympathisers of the Grand Sherif to be the enemies of Islam. He says that Indians should sympathise with the enemies of Turkey, and that the more Turkey is harassed the better it will be for the Allies. He remarks that the loyalty of the Indian Mahommedans is set aside on the slightest pretext. In the “Leader” (Allahabad) of the 1 st July, 1916, the editor says that in connection with the Arab revolt there seems to be a difference of opinion between the Indian Mahommedans and their co-religionists in Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia. He says that the latter are reported to be whole-heartedly with the Grand Sherif, whereas the Lucknow Moslems strongly condemn the Arabs. He says that it may be that the Moslems in Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt being more in touch with 'local conditions are better able to understand and appreciate the situation. In any case, says the editor, it seems unlikely that the attitude of Mahommedans outside Arabia will have any effect on the leaders of the revolt. The “ Gharhwali ” (Dehra Dun) of the 1 st July, 1916, says that the Arab revolt against Turkey is advantageous to the Allies and remarks that if it assumes a serious aspect, as it is hoped it will, the Turks will fare very badly. The “ Prem ” (Brindaban, Muttra) of the 5th July, 1916, refers to the Arab revolt, and remarks that the tyranny of the Turks has led the Grand Sherif to proclaim his independence. The editor expresses regret that the Indian Mahommedans have held meetings to protest against the action of the Sherif on the ground that the Arab revolt will cause harm to the Holy Places of Islam. He observes that the Arab revolt has made the Hejaz pilgrimage more convenient and enquires why Moslems express indignation at it. He says that it is possible that there may be some bloodshed at present owing to unrest, bu there will be peace andorder when the Arab control becomes firm at Mecca. He says that the British Government has already assured the Mahommedans that it will protect their sacred places, and Indians should be gratified at the news of the revolt. &amp; III.— Behar. 1. Moslem Papers. [None.] 2. Hindu Papers. The “ Pataliputra ” (Bankipore) writes to say that the Grand Sherif of Mecca declared war on the 9 th June, 1916, against the Sultan of Turkey and captured the towns of Mecca, Jeddah, and Taef, taking 45 military officers, 1,400 soldiers, and 6 guns. The paper quotes Doctor Suhrawardi (who says that the Sultan of Turkey has no authority to be a Khalif), and receives the news of the Sherif s activity with satisfaction. It is gratified with this news, because on the one hand this will make the Moslems of India peaceful and, on the other hand, it will lead to the humiliation of the Sultan of Turkey. Besides this, says the paper, the Mahommedans of Egypt and Kabul will deny the religious suzerainty of the Sultan of Turkey, and their loyalty and devotion to religion will be guided by one principle, because the Sherif of Mecca is friendly to the English. The “ Pataliputra ” (Bankipore) observes to the following effect: “The Moslem League of India has- expressed its sense of abhorrence and dismay at the Arab revolt, and has said that those who have sympathy for this rebellion are enemies to Islam. On the other hand, the telegram from Egypt tells us that the Maulvies of the mosque at Al-Azhar have praised the work of the Sherif of Mec . The Moslems of Syria and Mesopotamia are in favour of the Sherif. It appears i om the teleorams from Egypt that the educated Mussulmans of that place are pleased at the rebellion of the Arabs, and the Mahommedans of India are agitating serious y. What else can we call it but an aberration of the Moslem mind . The “ Mithila Mihir ” (Darbhanga), referring to the Proclamation of Independence by the Grand Sherif of Mecca (and the capture of the towns of Mecca, Jeddai, an Taef, with many prisoners, by him), observes to the following effect “ Things that were never dreamt of before are now taking place. Nobody knew before thaf such inimical relations would ever arise between^ the two important Mahommedan countries We do ^Moslem 8 world is affected bjOt, forThe Sultan” Turkey and the Sherif of Mecca are both looked upon by the Mussulmans with reverence. py.—B engal. 1 .

This reveren_ nd respect has nothing to do with the personality of the Sultan, but with his services o Mecca and Medina. Now, if the Sherif wants to acquire that honour tor pmse naturally it will be a very great change. Such changes cannot but cause anxie y o the Moslems.” — The “Sadaqat” (Calcuttaf of the 2 nd July says “We have already said that there cannot be any event so sad for the Moslems of India as the fact that the present war has created a very sad change m the re ations existing between Britian and Turkey. We are affected by this change simply because our fate is hound up with that of the two countries in question. _ While one is our protector, the other is the guardian of the Holy Places. This is why the Indian Moslems have ever been anxious for the maintenance of good relations between t em. It is our conviction that if we wish to stand among the rising nations oi the woi d, we should maintain our connection closely with England, because by loving hei a one we can reach the summit of our desires. When we look from the Moslem standpoint, then it becomes clear to us that the solidarity of the Moslems depends upon the met that the Moslems should make Mecca and Medina the centre of all their hopes and suppli cations. Under the circumstances, we have to show our deepest respect to the bultan of Turkey. In spite of this connection with the Sultan, the conduct of the Moslems since the declaration of war has been so good that even the Imperial Government had to acknowledge it. This should be considered a severe test of the^ practical loyalty of the Moslems. Thank God that Moslems have not been found wanting. “ The Moslems were just becoming used to the new condition of things during the war when suddenly and in a most unexpected fashion the Declaration of Independence by the Sherif game upon them like a great surprise. But there is nothing to wonder at in this. The Turks and Arabs have been at variance for a long time. ^ Taking advantage of the present difficulties of Turkey, the Arabs want to establish an independent State. No one can say how far the Sherif will succeed in this. No one, whether a Moslem or a non-Moslem, can deny this fact: that the action of the Sherif of Mecca is pure and simple rebellion against Turkey. His action is capable of ho other interpretation. “ If this rebellion had only a political aspect, then we would have called him a great rebel like Sir Boger Casement, but in the eyes of the Moslem world the action of the Sherif is more heinous than this, because this action of his has created the apprehension that the Holy Places may become the scene of bloodshed. “It is especially forbidden in the Koran to shed blood kp the^ Holy Places. Should not then the Sherif be considered an enemy of Islam who is going to involve these id oly Places ? “We are extremely grateful to the All-India Moslem League and Maulana Abdul Bari for expressing their indignation and abhorrence at the conduct of the Sherif of Mecca, and we hope that other Moslem Anjumans will follow the lead of the Moslem League. The problem of the Holy Places is a purely religious one and has no connection with war, and we can deal with it in perfect freedom. We distinctly remember that when the Italians during the Tripolian war wanted to make an aerial raid on the Holy Places, the British Government, exerted its influence and prevented them from doing so. When the British Government has got such a consideration for the feelings of its Mahommedan subjects, then we believe that it will prevent the Sherif from doing anything which will endanger the Holy Places. The “ Sadaqat ” (Calcutta) of the 4th July says :— “We regret very much that the opinion expressed by Lords Crewe and Cromer in regard to the rebellion of the Sherif of Mecca and the protection of Holy Places is altogether against Moslem sentiment, and are at a loss to understand what justification they had for dealing with the question of the protectorate of the Holy Places of Hejaz and Mesopotamia, seeing that the British Government itself has declared the present war as one exclusively prompted by political considerations. It we remember aright, when an attempt was made to discuss the question in Parliament, the Government stopped it, and issued a declaration to the effect that the British Government is only opposed to the present Turkish administration and not to the spiritual headship of the Sultan of Turkey. We recognise the fact that Turkey did not do well in joining Germany. It would have been better if she had sided with England. She will have to suffer for her mistakes. But all this does not in the least affect the spiritual position of Turkey. Lord Crewe thinks that the action of the Sherif of Mecca willsecure increased conveniences to the Hajis. He also says that it has been the wish of the British Government to maintain Moslem dignity in the Holy Places. Does Lord Crewe think that this is not the case now ? Does he think that the Sultan of Turkey is not a Moslem ? Does he think that a rebel official of the Sultan of Turkey is capable \)f becoming the custodian of the Holy Places? Will this rebel command the respect that the Sultan of Turkey does? We consider the opinion of Lords Crewe and Cromer as their individual opinions only and not that of the English Government.” 2. Hindu Papers. The “ Nayak ” (Calcutta) of the 28th June is surprised that the Mussulmans of Arabia should have risen against the Turkish Government. Turkey is fighting with great heroism against England, the greatest country in the world; has^ driven a Christian Power out of Gallipoli and Kut-el-A.mara, and has kept General Xownshend a prisoner at the latter place. There is, therefore, nothing in the Arab revolt which may cause rejoicings in the Moslem world. The late Sultan of Turkey did much to facilitate the pilgrimage to Hejaz. It is a well-known fact that the existence ol Moslem dominion in the world depends solely on Turkey being victorious in the war, for otherwise England and Russia will divide Turkey between themselves. The present situation in Asia Minor is such, that if Russia continues extending her power, and Turkey is weakened under Hun influence, Mecca will perhaps pass into the hands of the Christian Huns. England has always been a protector of religions. Arabia has been obliged to rise against Turkey out of consideration for her own future. Besides, this event will help the English to weaken German power. The Mussulmans of India and Eo-ypt are loyal to England; and if the Mussulmans of Arabia also take the British side Turkey’s downfall will have no effect on Mussulman interests. It will be a very p-ood thino- if the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina pass into the hands of the Koreish dynasty, 'indeed, the loss of these two places is as disgraceful to Turkey as its possession by the Koreish dynasty will enhance the dignity of the Moslem world. The “ Damik Bharat Mitra 5 (Calcutta) ol the 2 nd July says . The Moslem League has protested against the Declaration of Independence by the Sherif of Mecca. This feeling of the League seems to be shared by all thoughtiul Indian Moslems, but Lord Crewe and Lord Cromer have expressed their approval of the Sherif’s conduct. It would not be well for us to express our opinion on the subject because it is a question which has close connection with the spiritual requirements of the Moslems who do not want that their Holy Places should pass out of the hands of t p “n? custodians of the heritage left by the Prophet There - ample histonea evidence to show that the Sherif of Mecca has never been held m honour by the Moslems. The “ Hitavadi ” (Calcutta) of the 30th June does not exactly know whether the fact of traWa throwing off the Turkish yoke will please or displease the Mussulman community^ but sincere “Englishman” and other papers are rejoicing over the event ihe paper is inclined to think that Arabia’s Declaration of Independence is favourable to the interests of the Allies. The “Dainik Basumati ” (Calcutta) of the 3rd July is surprised at the hasty opinion expressed by the All-India Moslem League on the Arab revolt, and observes . “The a-entlemen responsible for the expression of this opinion do not seem to have itie gentlemen ^ The Sherif of Mecca is as good a given the question any careful L ' ^ there anv r e as0 n to suppose Mussulman as the members of the Moslem L ea ^ ' ^ - devotion to £f am . that the Mussulmans of Arabia and Egypt a 3 / f A2kia a anc [ Eownt what Now if the Arab revolt can commend itself to the peoples of can there be in it for the Moslen League to find hiult whh^ The question whether, after the dethronement of Abdul Kami y th Y e satisfactorily decided Turks when they deth ^°“ e f 3 d tricf adherents of the Islamic faith, because of their LTnf in^e |eik-u Alam ^a^the Mussulmans’of iS Th “they wel nol pre'paredTo accept the Caliphate of the Sultan, so they ought notnow to take a strong exception to the action of the Sherif of Mecca. We fail to find any justification for the fear expressed by the Moslem League as to the sanctity and safety of the Holy Places in Hejaz and Mesopotamia being threatened by the Arab revolt. Have the Young Turks ever been able to protect these places ? In fact, it isj due to them that there has of late been a state of anarchy in Hejaz and Mesopotamia. What reason is there for the Moslem League to suppose that the Sherif of Mecca will not be able to establish peace and good government ? If the Mussulmans of Arabia, Syria, and Egypt, who being practically “men on the spot,” and having an intimate knowledge of the state of affairs in Hejaz, can support the revolt, we do not think the Moslem League should have taken a different view, especially in an important political question like this.” Y. —Bombay. 1. Hindu Paper. The “ Shri Yenkateshwar ” is surprised at the protest meetings held by Mahom- medans touching the Declaration of Independence by the Grand Sherif of Mecca. It is of opinion that the Mahommedans should, on the contrary, be glad at the event, inasmuch as the Arabs will take care to protect the life and property of the pilgrims. It was the weakness of the Turkish Government which was responsible for their maltreatment, in spite of the noble assurance given by the British to keep the Holy Places inviolate. It therefore asks the Mahommedans to desist from any more needless protesting in the matter. 2. Parsi Paper. Contributing a letter to the “ Praja Mitra and Parsi,” an anonymous correspondent refers to the belief entertained in some quarters that the political prestige of the Anjuman-e-Islam has greatly suffered, and attributes the fact to the leaders of that body expressing their opinion when they should not, and to their remaining silent when they should speak out. The writer refers to the reticence of the Anjuman on the question of the revolt of the Sherif of Mecca, which has pained Moslem hearts, as witness the opinions expressed by the different branches of the Moslem League. He asks what the leaders of the Bhendi Bazar meeting of 10,000 Mahommedans, that met to protest against the Bombay session of the Moslem League, are busy thinking about. YI.—Madras. 1. Moslem Papers. The “ Qaumi Beport of the 29 th June, in continuation of its previous issues, gives a sketch of the history of Arabia, and writes that the British Government (which is a Christian Power) has solemnly promised the Mussulmans that they will protect the Holy Places of Islam. If the Government which is a friend of Islam had not been so considerate and sympathetic, God alone knows what would have happened by now ! The natural result of this occurrence is that most Mussulmans have forgotten the Turks and have begun to complain against the Arabs. Beally this enlightenment and sympathy are worthy of all praise. We do not say this event is remarkable because the Arabs have inopportunely changed sides, but we are of opinion that in what they have done they have been actuated by political rather than by religious motives. It has not yet been ascertained what religious grievances the Arabs have, or how the sacred law has been wrested to sanction their procedure. If, in reality, this idea of independence has been prompted by political aims and motives, it is advisable for us to await in silence for future development and let God judge between them, “ For is not God the supreme Judge ?” The “Qaumi Report ” of the 2 nd July gives, “in continuation,” a sketch of Arabian history, and observes :— “ It is out of place and inopportune to discuss here Turkish politics and civilisa tion ; our object is simply to prove that Arab government has never been, nor is it likely to be, beneficial.. Recording to British books of travel and the accounts of travellers, Arabian administration was never regarded as of any utility. It is an historical taunt that the Arabs would not have lost the Spanish Caliphate if they had been able to rule. “Ihe Arabs doubtless have the right to rule the followers of Islam, but in this; modern age they will find it difficult to establish their claims to that right until such time as they educate themselves and become civilised. The matter for most apprehen sion will be that certain Mussulman States and Administrations will not be able to recognise the Arab Government because they have foolishly made Mecca and Medina their centres of war. “ If they desired to declare their independence of Turkish rule they might have issued such announcement from some other province. As the Arabs have, however, drawn the sword in the sacred territory of God and the Apostle, they have by this act of theirs, and by laying siege to Medina, violated the sanctity of the Holy Places and made them the scene of war. These are the reasons why most Mussulmans condemn the procedure of the Arabs, and express their regret at and detestation of their mad act. “ It appears from the telegrams that the Turkish garrison have been taken prisoners. If this be true the Arab affair becomes more detestable, for to the generality of Mahommedans it means that the Turks did not consider it lawful to shed blood in the Holy Places. It is these things that will make a disagreeable impression on the public and create anxiety among the people. Most Mahommedans consider it to be a very grave occurrence and that the Arabs are entirely to blame. Apparently the religious importance and sacred influence of the Holy Places have created this sensational impression upon people’s minds—that the Arabs have proclaimed their independence and at the same time invited the Turks to stay in the sacred territory. “We frankly say that these ideas are baseless and that there is nothing in the occurrence, and we should not pay much attention to it, for history records several similar incidents. There have been revolts and rebellions in the Holy Places before.” The writer observes with regret that the contemporary English papers, which are unacquainted with both the Moslem mind and the spirit of Islam, are guilty of egregious blunders in this matter. Eor example, the “Statesman ” of the ‘25th June stated that the Arab revolt had^ created a feeling of joy among the Mussulmans of Calcutta, but the telegraphic messages of yesterday show that the Mussulmans of Calcutta repudiated the statement at a public meeting. ' On the 29th June the paper published the opinion of two Madras Mussulmans, but we and our local contemporaries, in spite of being on the spot in Madras, have not been able to hear “ their voices.” We fear this informa tion also is more or less as false as the report regarding the reputed feeling of the Calcutta Mussulmans! In any case, no individual or combined Moslem opinion can nullify the divine commands, Koranic texts, the traditions of the Apostle of God, the sacred law, and the consensus of opinion of the Moslem community. The “ Qaumi Beport ” of the 4th July writes that a meeting of the Council of the Madras Presidency Moslem League was held at the “ Anjuman,” under the presidency of Nawab Kauf Ahmad Khan Bahadur, Parthan, yesterday evening, when Mr. Yaqub Hasan Sait Sahib explained the present position and the substance of the resolution of the All-India Moslem League, &amp;c. After some deliberation and discussion he moved the following resolution, which was carried unanimously: “ That this Council of the Madras Presidency Moslem League records its opinion that the news of the revolutionary action of the Sherif of Mecca ^ in proclaiming Arab independence and bringing about a state of war in the region of the Holy Places, utterly regardless of their sanctity, has caused the Mussulmans of Southern India much pain. . . . “ The Council is also of opinion that the interference m the matter on the part of any European Power would be resented by Indian Mussulmans. 2. Hindu Paper. The “Sasilekha” of the 30th June has the following: “ The authorities here [Pondicherry] admitted 385 Hindus into the military service, gave them training for some months, and sent them to France,” _ _ . , , After pointing out that there is nothing in common between the Arabs and the Turks except that they are both Mahommedans, and that the former have been dissatisfied with the administration of their country by the latter, the Kerala [898—4] GPatrika ” of the 1 st July observes that the news of the declaration of independence by the Arabs is likely to be hailed with joy by all Mahommedans but the Turks, as it will remove all obstacles to their free access to the Sacred Places of Mecca and Medina, and that it will tend to diminish the power of Turkey by half. APPENDIX (C). STOTZINGEN-N EUFELD MISSION TO ARABIA. [From “ Arab Bulletin ” No. 13.] IT was reported in No. 2 of this Summary (L* 2 th June) that a small party of “ Germans,” including a lady, had come to Yambo and was lodging there when B.I.M.S. “ Dufferin ” arrived oil the port on the 4th June. A previous report about the movement of this party had been obtained when the same ship was at Hassani Island, near Umlejh, on the 3rd June. It is now possible from a report brought by the son of the cliief Sheikh of Yambo, and from certain papers which have come into our hands, to give some further account of the composition and fortunes of this party. The head of it was Major (Colonel ?) Freiherr Othmar von Stotzingen. He is, presumably, the Major of that name appointed Senior G.S.O. to the 27th Division of the XIII Army Corps [Wurtemburg] in February 1913. He left Berlin on the 15th March last, carrying with him (among other documents, doubtless) a private recom mendation to Enver Pasha from the Countess Schlieffen. This letter says that “ the duty which the gentleman in question is to take over in the east is in a certain sense the result of a decision of your Excellency.” It proceeds to recommend him as knowing English (his own letters support this) and French perfectly, and being acquainted with Arabic, “as he spent four winters in Africa in the years before the war and travelled in the company of Arabs.” The lady goes on to say that Baron von Stotzingen “ does not obtrude his personality and has not those characteristics which often make the Germans disliked in foreign parts.” This letter was written with the knowledge that Enver would be absent from Constantinople when the Freiherr would arrive, and it was in fact never presented. Yon Stotzingen took £T. 30 with him from Berlin and reached Constantinople in the course of the 17th March. He remained there, at Tokatlian’s in Pera, till the 26th, and then proceeded by the Baghdad railway to Adana where he was on the 30th. Probably there, and in relation to the break of the railway on the Amanus, he wrote a note, an English version of which lias come into our hands, to the commandant at Tarsus stating that Monday (3rd April ?) was “ the last day that motor-cars are going from one station to the other of the interruption of the railway. He must himself have left early that day, for he was at Aleppo in the course of the 4th April, and stayed there till the 8 th April. On the 12 th April he was at Damascus, and appears to have had something to do with the wireless installation there; for one Fr. Hammer “ Leiter F.T. (Field Telegraph ?) of the Turkish IV A.C.” writes to him, on information received from Unteroffizier Tholber, that one of the masts of the receiving station is bent; proposes to repair it with the plant in the Kadem railway shops, and thinks he could set it up again in two days’ time. He evidently expected an order from Yon Stotzingen. It is worth making the suggestion, on the strength of this letter and of another indication, that Yon Stotzingen’s mission was (in part at any rate) connected wdth the installation of wireless telegraphy in Arabia. We have received from Aden rumours of an installation in Yemen communicating with Mecca ; but the Emir of the latter assures us these are false, and that no wireless apparatus existed at Mecca. Anticipations of Yon Stotzingen’s work, translated into fact, may explain these rumours. Yon Stotzingen stayed in Damascus till the end of April. That his delay was largely due to differences of opinion between Enver’s party, which had commissioned him, and Jemal Pasha, into whose jurisdiction he had come, is clear from an interesting document published later. This was written by Yon Stotzingen at El-Ala on the back of the letter from Fr. Hammer already quoted. In it he reveals his relations withJemal Pasha and his chief of staff, Fuad Bey, who, it appears, had done their best either to prevent him going on to Arabia or to hinder him there. This is the best evidence we have had yet of the continued variance between Enver and Jemal ; of the precarious position of Germans in the Arab area; and of the unlikelihood of their being allowed to be in the region of the Holy Cities. ^Accompanied by two German soldiers (mechanics or orderlies), an Indian servant (Haji Mohammed) and a Moghrabi (probably the secret police-agent told off by Jemal to watch him), Yot Stotzingen left Damascus at last on the 2 nd May, and went down the Hejaz railway to El-Ala, where he arrived late on the 4th May. There he encountered an old acquaintance whom he calls H.N. (the first initial being possibly K not H), an apostate to Islam. This man had taken to himself a Kurdish wife only 18 years of age, and was accompanied by her. He had, apparently, gone to Arabia in concert with, but earlier than, Yon Stotzingen, and failed in an attempt to get through to Yemen. He was impecunious and had used for private expenses the funds given him for his mission. He had recently obtained permission to make a second attempt to get to Yemen, and his fluency in Arabic made him a desirable companion for Yon Stotingen. There can be little doubt that this man was H[err] or K[arl] N[eufeld], once a notorious captive of the Khalifa at Omdurarm, and known by us to have been in Arabia last spring. The indications given in Yon Stotzingen’s statement fit him admirably. The party had to wait four days at least at El-Ala for an escort and camels, the latter provided by the Billi. The escort when it arrived seems to have brought with it a (wireless?) telegraphic apparatus and other telegraphic plant for Yon Stotzingen’s use. Then the party went down to El-Wejh, expecting to embark for a southern port. But it must have been disagreeably surprised to find that, since the 1 st May, a stricter naval patrol of the coast had been instituted by us, and that the long-sea route was out of the question. Yon Stotzingen, therefore, determined to continue the journey by land. He proceeded on Billi camels to Umlejh, which was reached in the latter part of May, and thence on Juheinah camels to Yambo. Before the end of this month Yon Stotzingen, Neufeld, the latter’s wife, the two German soldiers, Haji Mohammed, and the Moghrabi were guests of the commandant of Yambo, being lodged at first in the quarantine station and later in the “ serai.” The Sherifs revolt broke out at Medina on the 5th June.'and was imminent m the south. Yon Stotzingen seems to have realised that his further progress was barred on both land and sea. The Arabs were displeased by the presence of Europeans in Yarnbo, and were further incensed by the efforts of their Sheikh (Ah Ibn Abdullah of the Juheinah?), who had just returned from Suakin in his sambuk. The upshot was that the commandant arranged for the flight northwards of Yon Stotzmgen, the lady and one other German (no doubt, Neufeld) ; but apparently he dared_ not send a laro-er party through the tribes. The three got safely to Umlejh again by the 11 th June and Baron von Stotzingen sent a pencilled note back to Haji Mohammed, the Indian servant. He sajs that they met with _ molestation from bedouins 10 kilom. from Umlejh, and it appears they had to drop their baggage. The others, four in number, who had been left behind at i am bo, succeeded, with the commandant’s help, in chartering a dhow from three Juheinah Sheikhs, Ahmed el Hassani and another of the Ahmadi sub-tribe, and Makbul of the babra, who guaranteed their transport to El-Wejh in safety. They put to sea, but were pursued from Yambo and overtaken. The two Germans (mechanics or orderlies) were killed either by drowning or otherwise ; but the Moghrabi and the Indian were spared. Ihe naners of the party were taken and some of these have eventually reached us via the Sudan They include Turkish staff-maps.pf the south Red Sea coast (Asjr and Yemen) • two copies of the Vienna staff’s “ Ubersichtskarte von Vorderasien ^ ; the documents made use of in this account; some books of travel, geography and anti- British propaganda (not yet tp hand) ; a photograph of a German soldier with h,s two little boh and a cut from ad illustrated paper showing a group of Pathan soldiers n the company of Turks, with a legend written beneath m four Indian scripts, setting “orth thahkisE “A photograph of those Indian soldiers British army on the Suez Canal, joined the Turkish forces. The Ottoman government has treated with great respect and honour these patriotic soldiers. This last document was probably taken from Haji Mohammed, the Indian servant as were other papers of his master. It is possible this Indian was himself one of the Llrters from the Canal. It is difficult to see how Von Stotzmgen could have come otherwise by a servant of that nationality.No. 3, could not have reached Constantinople yet, I telegraphed that a merchant had proposed to me, giving full assurance of my safety, a route El Ula to Taif, which would skirt the region forbidden for religious reasons. I hoped to succeed in moving G[emal] P[asha], through the War Office at Constantinople, to grant permission, seeing that only a short stretch would be covered from El Ula to the latitude of Medina within the region under his control. ^ •• •• # , On the chance of the effort to obtain this permission seeming likely to prove abortive. I fixed May 1 as the day of my departure. On May 1, a telegram came to hand from the Acting Military] A[ttachb] from which I thought I could gather that to use any further Constantinople influence, was futile. Further demarches with G[emal] P[ashaJ seemed quite hopeless, because he was trying to delay, if not to prevent, the expedition by all sorts of pretexts : first came religious reasons ; then danger to our safety; finally considerations of internal politics were pleaded; and the use of roads, which had been unhesitatingly permitted before the war, and even in part during the war (e.g., to the merchants from Massawa), was refused. G[emal] P[asha] seemed to be influenced by his Chief of General Staff, Fuad Bey, whose sympathies are well known to lean towards France.* The War Ministry at Constantinople] contrary to the promise it had previously communicated to me, bowed to G[emal] P[asha’s] will as regards the expedition, not merely in his district but further on to the south of Medina. When I reported myself on leaving, F[uad] B[ey] declared that the stretch between Kunfuda. and Loheia must be covered by sea : but G[emal] P[asha] gave us free choice of going by road from Kunfuda with the Turkish detachment, or going by sea. On May 2, I started on my journey accompanied, on G[emal] P[asha’s] order, by a secret police agent, detailed to look after our “ safety,” and I arrived here on the evening of the 4th. In spite of the promise of F[uad] B[ey] to order the necessary camels and escort of gendarmes here by telegram, we have to wait, on arrival here, three or four days for our escort and baggage-animals. The detachment is bringing the apparatus and telegraph station and the surplus money. TEN. obtained permission a few days ago to continue his journey, and had begun it : here we joined forces again. It had seemed expedient that we should make the journey separately, because the possibility that one of us two could reach Yemen [would be] greater, and H.N.’s linguistic facility might always serve henceforward to get us over difficulties. It is questionable whether N. can get through with the money allowed him, since he [had] imoortant private expenses (not solvent) at Damascus, which he could only meet by expending the sum allowed him for his mission. Before his departure he married in Moslem fashion a Kurdish girl of only 18 years of age, whom he took with him on his journey. It is reported here that the Turkish Government has not allowed any trains with foodstuffs for North Arabia to pass for a month, and that consequently a lively trade has developed in the towns of the Bed Sea coast between British merchant-vessels and the Arabs. Note by Arab Bureau, ’Cairo .—The general interest of this document has been already emphasised. It remains to call attention to certain points of detail and certain inferences :— 1. Jemal Pasha’s authority is not limited to the southern boundary of the Damascus vilayet, but extends south of Ma’an all down the Hejaz Bailway to Medina. 2. There is a possible trade route from El-Ala, which passes east of Medina to Es-Seil and Taif. Probably in the latter part of its course, it coincides with the Dark es-Sharqi from Medina to Es-Seil and Mecca. 3. Jemal Pasha had reason last April to be nervous about the Arab attitude towards Germans, and probably some foreknowledge of the coming revolt in Hejaz, which was not imparted to Yon Stotzingen. 4. Fuad Bey is a former Military Attache at Paris, known to have been Jemal Pasha’s alter ego and right-hand man ever since the latter’s arrival in Syria. 5. Enver acts independently of Jemal, but is unwilling or unable to coerce him in his proper province. ' . . , . , 6. The Turks in April and May were virtually blockading Hejaz as strictly by land,, as we were by sea. * Follows erased unfinished sentence. It is incomprehensible how G[emal] P[asha] has come to take', views not only .... tt [898—4]One or two documents of less interest not yet quoted have come into our hands, notably a letter in Hindi addressed to Haji Mohammed by Mulazim Naji, of Umlejh, under date May 31. It shows that the German party had gone on some days previously to Yambo, and that it included a person called “ Dik,” to whom Najy gives the title “ Monsignor” (this probably means nothing more than Monsieur): presumably, as he too made friends with a mere Mulazim, he was of inferior estate, and, probably, one of the German soldiers afterwards killed. Naji mentions that an enemy steamer had appeared recently oh Umlejh, and says “ you have seen with your own eyes the state and poverty of Hejaz.” Other documents, taken from this party, are said to be still with the Sheikh ot Yambo. Every effort will be made to obtain them. APPENDIX (D). The Turkish “ Committee ” and Islam. THE following is a translation of an article which has just appeared in “ A1 Mokattam.” It is headed : “ A letter addressed to the Mahommedan world, and a demand for the opinion of the Ulema (Theologians) ” :— I have mentioned in a series of articles, which were published in “ A1 Mokattam ” some months ago, bearing the signature of “ Ghanani,” something about the pan- Turkish propaganda in Turkey, stating that the Turks in general and the officers in particular are the strongest factor in the formation of the policy of the Ottoman Government, and that the energy of this party, which is all in all there, was directed to Turkifying the nationalities of which the Empire is composed by any means available. I now add that because they realise that the Mahommedan religion is based on the Arab nationality, the present Turkish Government also intend to modify that faith in such a way as to harmonise with their own national traditions. A young Turkish graduate of a Constantinople high school once told me (not knowing that I was an Arab) that the mention of the name of Mahommed within the mosque and on their minarets is the most impor tant advertisement for the Arab races in the Moslem communities and throughout the world. !£ It has therefore become,” said he, “ very difficult for us (the Turks) to enlarge the sphere of our influence or establish our national ideals^until we have modified the Moslem religion. This should be done by degrees, ending with its absolute abandonment.” He further said that the traditions of the Ottoman Government are purely Islamic or Arabic, and that in order to trace and understand these traditions it is necessary to trace them in the Arabic language and Arabic literature, which is one of the factors that tend to give the Turkish nationality an Arabic tinge ; and “ so long as we are brought up as Mahom- medans, the Arabs will continue to be our moral masters, which mastership we are all convinced is the only deterrent to our progress. We have therefore decided to be Turks before every other thing, and to attain this end we must begin with the modification of the Mahommedan religion.” This statement is typical of what we have been hearing of late years in Constantinople and the provinces. As a matter of fact the Committee had begun to put this policy into force. They sent their envoys to Asia Minor and delegated the preachers to initiate the public into their new mode of thought by means of sermons in the mosques of Constantinople. The foremost exponent of this movement was the notorious Obeid Alla, who launched the first of his sermons in Hamadan, 1331, in the Mosque of Aya, Sophia, poisoning the public mind, instead of directing it in the right way according to the dictates of his religion. This campaign against Islam was further enhanced by publications and pamphlets, which were freely distributed in Constantinople and Asia Minor. The work entitled “ Kum Gedid,” which was published by the Shems Printing Press in Constantinople in 1331, in ninety-four pages, and of which I possess a copy, is typical of these publica tions. This, if circumstances permit, I propose to photograph and publish for the information of the Mahommedan world, but I now quote some passages. In this connection I ask for God’s mercy for the souls of Emir Aref El Shihabi and Abdel Ghani El Areisi, who were lately hanged by Jemal Pasha because of their zeal—theoutcome of deep-rooted faith and piety—in their attacks against this book and the infidel teachings contained therein. In publishing these facts I feel I am doing my duty, otherwise I should be sinning against truth and religion, as in keeping these dark lies tne possibility of danger to Islam, and I should be guilty before God in the hereafter. I desire to put before my Moslem brethren the cause which made me take this view of the Committee, so that they may be in a position to understand the various points at issue; because I believe that the difference 'of opinion between those who have despaired of them and those who still hope to reform them is due to their being thoroughly understood by the former and not by the latter. The energetic and wily Germans have been parading for some years the idea of “ Berlin to Baghdad,” and convincing Anwar (Enver) and his clique that they intend to introduce nirkey into the Germanic Union. But, realising that Moslems would find this idea highly repugnant, as it means the placing of Islam under the power of a non- Mahommedan Government with absolute control over the resources of the Empire, they prevailed upon the Committee leaders (whose religion was benumbed by German education) to get rid of Islam, which they believed to. be a hindrance. They thought of attacking the tenets of Islam, beginning with the abolishing of mosques and the seizure of the revenue of their Wakfs, utilising it in their novel enterprises such as “ Bar Badaai ” (Hall of Fine Arts), which was built in Constantinople to be a dancing and music school, and such as “ Turan Bera Khana si” (Turan’s Brasserie) and “ Ashiai Askaria Tigaretkhana si ” (Army and Navy Stores). The reader may think I am exaggerating when I state that the Committee have actually abolished the mosques utilising their Wakfs to the benefit of dancing halls, coffee houses, &amp;c. To such a reader I say that the idea of abolishing the mosques was made public. I quote hereunder some passages of the sermon delivered by Sheikh Obeid Alla in Itamadan, 1331, and which was inserted by the Government in the book entitled “ Kum Gedid ” :— “ The prophet used to prevent the people building mosques in proximity to each other. He used to think that one mosque would be enough for several villages, with the idea of preserving unity amongst the Moslem community. It would be better therefore to abolish all the “ takias ” and all mosques not built by the Sultans, and to utilise their funds for military expenditure.” The theory of abolishing mosques and takias was translated into action by Government, who demolished the takia at “ Baghdji Kabusi ” and built in its place a hotel called “ Bir Nomrolo Awkaf Khani ” (Wakfs Hotel No. l). I now wish to explain to the reader why the book in question was entitled “ Kum Gedid.” The Committee call the libraries which contain Islamic books, and which are requested, the books of “ Kum Ateik,” because they contain the tenets of Islam and Arabic literature, &amp;c. These, in their opinion, are old and unworthy conceptions which should be substituted by the new thoughts and conceptions of the “ Kum Gedid ”; and if we enquire what are their beliefs and new conceptions, and in what they differ from our beliefs and conceptions, which are stigmatised as “ old,” we shall find the reply in a passage in “Kum Gedid,” pp. 51 and 52, quoting Sheikh Obeid Alla’s sermon in the Aya Sophia Mosque :— “ The ‘ Kum Gedid ’ do not repudiate the rites of fasting, prayer, pilgrimage, almsgiving, and the confession of faith, they adhere to them, but they do not consider them to be essential. The essential points, according to ‘ Kum Gedid,’ are : I. Beason ; II. The confession of faith; III. Good character; IV. Jehad and waging of war, by giving life and substance; V. Unity and concord under the banner of the great Turkish Sultanate to obtain the necessities of war.” The Committee’s hatred of the Arabs made them hate Islam, which they designate as Arabic. It made them further hate the four pious Khalifs—Abu Bekr, Omar, Osman, Ali (who are the glory of Islam), because they were Arabs. In p. 89 of “Kum Gedid” we find the following passage quoted from Sheikh Obeid Alla’s sermon in Aya Sophia Mosque : — “ What folly ! What stupidity ! You write the names of the Arab Khalifs in your mosques, and do not mention with due respect a name of one of your Turkish Khalifs who were made sacred in the Hadiths of the Prophet. When the r 898—4] II’t ( 26 ) name of the Turkish Khalif is mentioned the preacher descends a step down the pulpit in order to minimise his importance and degrade him ; you say your midday prayer • all these formalities were introduced by the Arabs with a view to humiliate you. You did not stop at that; you went further to neglect your sacred people, to sanctify foreign Sheikhs such as Abdel Gader El Gilam and El Sayed El Badawi, &amp;c. You maintain that Arabic is the language or the inhabitants of Heaven (Paradise), that it is the tongue of Munkir and Nakir (the angels of death) and other angels, and that it is the language of God the Almighty Himself. You also say that Syria is the land of Resurrection. 1 hese sayings were invented by the Arabs for your deception. They made you believe that a man will rise from their midst called El Mahdi and such other tales.” r* On p. 88 :— a I am astounded because of the dulness of your minds and the falsity of your beliefs. Where was El Khudr* before he visited this city (Constantinople) ? This mosque is the heritage of the Turkish conqueror.! Why did El Khudr not c&lt;&gt;me here before the Turkish conquest and turn its front towards El Eaabaljl ? He apparently waited until the conquering Sultan came, to follow m his wake. You fail to sanctify the Turkish conqueror (Peace be upon him) and venerate an imaginary person you call El Khudr.” Sheikh Obeid Alla was not content with applying the phrase “ God bless him and preserve him ” to the conqueror, but he equally applies it (p. 71) to members of the Union and Progress party, such as “ Rida, Asad, Gaweid, Shukri, Anwar. ^ Sheikh Obeid Alla dared to deliver his sermon in the Mosque of Ay a Sophia because he was under the protection of an armed Turkish police force. A Sheikh of the mosque expressed a desire once to repudiate some infidel statements made by him, but he found himself in the hands of a policeman. The Sheikh tried to explain to the policeman that he had no desire to ask Sheikh Obeid Alla to a duel, and that he simply meant to discuss a religious point with him; but the policeman informed him that he had orders to silence by force anyone attempting to object to any of Sheikh Obeid Alla’s statements. . The above is only an insignificant part of what I know of the Unionists, ibis I put before the Moslems that I may not be guilty of silence. It is, then, for everyone to form his own ideas about them. It is for each one to be either for or against the truth as his conscience and faith dictate to him. _ In the meantime I wish to have the Fetva of the Grand Mufti, the Sheikh of El-Azhar, and all those who are entrusted with Mahommedan learning, about a Government that defends with its police a wicked Sheikh who declares in the biggest of mosques that prayer, fasting, almsgiving, pilgrimage, and the Confession of Faith are not essential in religion. Mfhat do they think of a Government that demolishes the mosques of God in order to erect in their place hotels to spend their resources on, and “ Dar El Badaai” for teaching of dancing and music ? What do they think of a nation in whose mosques it is proclaimed that it is a folly and ignorance to mention the names of Abu Bekr, Omar. Osman and Ali, whom they classify, together with the other Moslem Ulema and Moslem Saints, among the foreigners ? And what do they think of the use of the formula “ God bless him and preserve him ” for persons like Gaweid and others, who are known, beyond all doubt, to have decided to alter and modify the Koran and to lead the people by degrees into infidelity and paganism because such are Turkish and because Islam is Arabic ? Please give me your Fetva.

The Islamic Caliphate ” by Shaykh Shaweksh, President of the Uniyersiy of Salaheddin-el-Ayoubi in Jerusalem. [This note was written by a member of the War Office Staff under the direction of O’Poss.] This booklet, like several others published since the beginning of the war in Turkey, Switzerland, and Germany, both in Arabic and in Turkish, has principally in view the vindication of the right of the Sultan of Turkey to the Caliphate, and the checking of the movement started years ago by a large body of Arab Moslems for independence and the proclamation of the Arab Caliph from the Koreish family to which the Prophet belonged. The author accuses France and England of fomenting the discontent of the Arabs and keeping alive their aspirations. Abdul Aziz Shaweesh endeavours to prove that not only the prestige but the very existence of Islam demands that the Sultan of Turkey should be the sole and undisputed Caliph by right of succession and power, as he alone can defeat his enemies and the enemies of Islam, and gather his enemies under one flag. Abdul Aziz’s arguments, though weak and vague, are compiled in a manner that may stir Moslem fanaticism, especially amongst the ignorant classes. The author, naturally inspired by the Young Turks, appeals to the religious sentiments of Mohammedans, and strongly impresses upon them the necessity of rallying to the Caliph and upholding him, as he alone is the defender of the Islamic faith. “ If it was’nt for the dynasty of Othman,” he says, “ the political status of Islam would not have existed, and the Moslems would have become a scattered and abandoned nation.” The danger of such an argument lies in the fact that ignorant Mohammedans do not stop to consider the lack of sound reasoning, but are carried away by religious and sentimental misgivings. The writer does not underrate the strong claims that a Koreish, a descendant of the Prophet, has on the Caliphate, and therefore in a lengthy argument he tries to prove that the last of the Caliphs invested, of his own free will, Sultan Suleiman I with the dignity and title of Caliph : he then recalls several passages from the Koran in order to impress on his readers that the Prophet’s wish was that the Caliphate should not be hereditary but elective, and to be invested in the man who has the power and means of upholding the faith, end preserving Islam from the evil intrigues and desecration of its enemies. Ubdul Aziz Shaweesh concludes his discourse by saying: “This war will end and will reveal three hundred million hearts believing in God and Mohammed and in that victorious Caliph who waved the flag of Islam, exalted its word, and confirmed its laws.” APPENDIX (F). The Sherif of Mecca ^nd the All Moslem League. (Leading article in the Calcutta “Statesman” of July 2 , L916.] We have received a number of resolutions, purporting to come from representative Mohammedan bodies, in which the action of the Grand Sherif of Mecca in declaring his independence is denounced in violent terms. It is obvious that these protests, even if they were genuine expressions of Mohammedan feeling in this country, could have no effect upon the proceedings of the Moslem potentate against whom they are ostensibly directed. He is not likely to hear of them, and, should he by chance come to know that resolutions condemning his conduct had been passed, he would probably treat them with contempt. It would not be suggested, we suppose, by those who have concocted these pronouncements that the British Government should intervene in the- interests of the Young Turks who have forced their country into hostilities against Great Britain, Turkey’s oldest friend and protector. What, then, is the object of the protest of the A11-India Moslem League ? In order to appreciate the position it is necessary to realise that the body which calls itself by this high-sounding name represents only a very small section of Moslem opinion. The control of the League has been captured by young politicians who plume themselves on advanced ideas but who.* . m 28 ) do not possess the confidence or command the support of the influential members of the Mohammedan community. When, therefore, the League passes such a resolution as it has just issued it is expedient to ask by whom it was proposed and who were present when it was carried. Without these particulars it is safe to surmise that the President met the Secretary or the Secretary conferred with himself and that the imposing resolution merely means that a handful of persons deemed it desirable to declare their disapproval of the Grand Sherif. There can be very little doubt that this is precisely what happened. Committees are not easy to assemble in this country on short notice, and in point of fact there was no time to obtain a representative gathering to approve the protest sent forth in the name of the All-India Moslem League. The ease with which resolutions can be manufactured and circulated is seen in the case of the pronouncement which professes to come from the Moslems of this city. Calcutta Mussulmans, it was stated in the resolution, assembled under the presidency of a most reverend imam, had united in denouncing the Arabian rebels. Inquiries showed that Calcutta Mussulmans had been in blissful ignorance of the great gathering at which they were supposed to have been present. What actually happened was that a private meeting was. held in someone’s house. It is alleged that fifty persons were present, but fifteen would probably have been a liberal estimate. From this hole-and-corner caucus issued the pronouncement which claimed, with gross impertinence, to express the views of Calcutta Mohammedans. From one investigated case may be deduced the character of the other protests, and the Government of India would be well advised, before allowing more resolutions from Mohammedan gatherings to be telegraphed all over the country, to take steps to ascertain whether they are what they profess to be. Genuine Mohammedan opinion is entitled to the highest respect, and will always be treated by Government with full consideration. But there is no reason why the lynx-eyed censors should sanction the transmission over the State telegraphs of mischievous-fabrications which misrepresent Mohammedan feeliim. The significance of the resolutions, regarded as expressions of Mohammedan opinion, is probably less than nothing. But the framers ot these missives have some motive for their action. That they are really concerned for the Holy Places seems improbable. Doubtless there are many conservative Moslems who contemplate with keen regret the misfortunes of modern Turkey, though brought on by herself, and who lament the troubles of the Sultan. The resolutions, however, do not proceed from this respectable class. They come from the politicians, and, this fact being remembered, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that they have two objects, to create a hostile feeling against the Government of India and to express sympathy with the Young Turks. The announcement that a rebellion had occurred in the Hejaz came from the Government of India, and it was couched in terms which implied that the Government were not ill-pleased to learn that the Grand Sherif was in revolt. The impression thus cdven may not have been intended, but the ordinary reader would certainly derive the conviction that the Indian Government looked upon the action of the Grand Sherif with approval. Whether it was wise or necessary for the Government to announce what had happened in the Hejaz is a question on which opinions will differ. So far as can be seen, there was no reason- why the news should not have been disseminated through the usual channels, in which case the attitude of the Government of India towards the rising would not have been defined in any way. Bightly or wrongly, however, the news was officially communicated, and in-a form which conveyed a plain intimation of official opinion. The agitators have cleverly utilised this fact and, while they ostensibly denounce the Grand Sherif of Mecca, they are fully aware that they are in reality condemning the Government of India. It is clear also that, by protesting against the rebellion of the Grand Sherif, they are implicitly proclaiming sympathy with Enver Pasha and his motley band of Germanised Turks. They dare not openly profess their support of the enemies of Great Britain, but they think it safe to express their real views under the mask of anxietv for the Holv Places. 4 -SECRET. O' -J 1 APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARAB REPORT No. V. (New Series.) unofficial means. There are various indications that the Turkish Government will presently begin a i new reign of terror in Syria in the form of massacre, execution, and violence. The extract from Sir George Roos-Keppel’s letter to the Viceroy deserves careful attention, as giving in non-telegraphic form his precise views of the situation in the North-West Frontier province. As regards the co-ordination of work between Mesopotamia and Cairo, there still seems to be some vagueness as to the functions and status of the personnel of the Arab Bureau. From the printed form forwarded by Sir P. Z. Cox, it would appear that he is under the impression that the Bureau’s headquarters are in London and not in Cairo. There is still no information from any of the Arab ports in the Persian Gulf which, J after a lapse of two months, is somewhat singular; especially when it is remembered f that G.O.C. Singapore, found time and opportunity to report not only on the reception of the news in Singapore itself, but also in the Dutch territories of Java and the Federated Malay States. Special attention is drawn to the Appendix, and if time will allow the reprinted newspaper articles should be read. The contrast between the newspaper propaganda of the French controlled press and the leading article of the independent Indian newspaper is more than instructive. The Arab article is admirably designed in every way, and shows policy, learning, and purpose; the Indian article is windy, confused, forensic, and ignorant to a degree. The negotiations between the Sherif' and Idrissi have not reached a dangerous stage, and there appears to be ground for hope that the matter will be settled. Attention is drawn to the difficulty of carrying on negotiations between two fractious notables by officers who receive instructions which have to be considered by or emanate from two offices in London, the High Commissioner (Egypt), the Indian Government (Simla), and the General Officer Commanding at Aden. THEBE is no material change in the situation since last week, but this report contains a number of items which will repay study. The general tone of the information from Hejaz is more hopeful in regard to the Sherif’s operations, but the future depends on the effectiveness of our action against the Turks in the Sinai peninsula, such success as we have obtained is probably responsible for the increased activity of the Arabs. With regard to the French mission to the Sherif, it is suggested that this would best serve the ends of the Entente if it were confined strictly to business in regard to the pilgrimage and to financial assistance therefor. As regards the Sherif’s proclamation, as the French Government have now no objection, it would appear advisable that its publication in Egypt should be proceeded with, and that it be spread about the Arabian littoral and in Lower Mesopotamia by [898—3]Had the Indian Government at its disposal any native journalist sufficiently interested or well-informed to write pamphlets and press correspondence equal in quality to the Algerian production, it would seem possible that Moslem public opinion in India might have been decently prepared for the present situation. In India the Moslems seem to know as little of Turkish politics as of Islamic history. The Tunisian’s memorandum on the Sherif is a remarkable piece of current history and should assist in arriving at a proper estimation of the Sherif s policy and character as well as the political world in which he moves.

McMahon [No. 664] that (l) he saw no objection to the withdrawal of Idrisi’s forces from Comfida if Idrisi could be induced to consent, leaving the matter to our arbitration after the war ; and every effort should be made to induce him to take a reasonable view ; (2) the Sherif should have it clearly pointed out to him that Idrisi is our ally, and he should be asked why he objected to the latter occupying Comfida ; (3) His Majesty’s Government will use their good offices to mediate after the war, but has no intention of taking sides in Arab disputes ; (4) now all should concentrate their efforts in defeating the Turk This was telegraphed by Mr. Chamberlain on the following day to India and Aden with the following addition : “ You will realise the importance of making the withdrawal as little distasteful as possible to Idrisi, whose loyal attitude we appreciate.” Sir H. McMahon, in a despatch dated the 13th August [No. 688j, reported the course of the negotiations with idrisi. The commander of the “Northbrook,” lying at Jeisan, acting for and under the instructions of the S.N.O. in the Red Sea, informed Idrisi that the ship would leave Comfida, and that the garrison should be withdrawn within forty-eight hours. Idrisi objected on the ground that the summary ejection of the garrison would damage his prestige and ours, as he had been installed at Comfida by us ; he flatly refused to withdraw in forty-eight hours, and asked for at least twenty days’ extension to allow him to confer with the Sherifis representative and so save his face; if the ship left Comfida he should hold us responsible for the safety of the r8Q8—si Bmu that garrison, and if the extension of time were refused he should join the Turks, and at once commence hostilities against the Sherif. This was on the 8th August. Two days later the commander of the “ Northbrook ” informed the S.N.O. that as the evacuation depended on a satisfactory interview with the Sherifs representative Idrisi would certainly refuse to guarantee its being done by the 28th August ; he meant business, and the evacuation of Comfida without his orders would precipitate a crisis. The commander of the ^ Suva telegraphed on the same day that the garrison would not leave without Idrisi’s written order, and that reinforcements were said to be on their way. Eventually Idrisi wrote to the commander of the Northbrook,” admitting that hostilities against the Sherif would be opposed to the general interests, and agreeing to withdraw the garrison provided that appearances could be saved with the tribes. H &gt; urged the importance of his meeting a representative of the Sherif, as this would enable him to explain that the withdrawal was not compulsory, but a matter of policy; other wise the tribes might go over to the enemy. Colonel Wilson advised the Sheri! to send someone to discuss matters with Idrisi, at the same time informing him that it had been decided that the garrison should leave, and that twenty days or thereabouts should be given for the making of the necessary arrangements. The Sherif agreed to send a representative, and said that he placed his interests entirely in our hands. feir H. IVfcMahon expressed the opinion that we were bound to support the Sherif, whilst making things as easy as possible for Idrisi, whose claim to Comfida was very weak. The Sherif s Operations. General Clayton telegraphed on the 12th and 13th August [LG. 1155 and 1177] (1.) An Egyptian battery had silenced the fort at Taif, and cleared most of the barracks. (2.) Faisul reported from Medina that the morale of the Arabs had been restored by the arrival of the rifles and supplies to such an extent that he contem plated a renewal of the attack on the town. (3.) The Turks had sent Arab troops from Medina back to Syria as unreliable, and had leplaced them by a smaller number of Turks drawn from all units m Syria. (4.) Shaykh Ghanb had taken Um Lejj for the Sherif, and had reported that all . . of Juhema tribe were ready to join in as soon as they had arms. \ nm as ^ e T for an aeroplane or seaplane demonstration at i ambo. (6.) I he moral effect of the Sheriffs action in Syria seemed to have been very great and most harmful to the prestige of the Turks. (7.) Colonel Wilson hoped that action would be taken as soon as possible against the railway, as it was of the greatest importance. (8.) The Turks,_ advancing somewhere, seemed to have been met on the 3rd August .)} Shenf Ali [son of the Sherif of Mecca], who, in a running fight of twenty-eight hours, took an officer, some men, mules, and arms, and stated that the Turks lost heavily. He led part of the Turkish force into the desert, where it seems to be surrounded, and'to be without food or water. rxr o! en §! a g® ment &gt; Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 13th August fM 089 t ^ t J^ he S ^ ri f °f Yambo had asked him to transmit the news to the Sherif 11 ■ ' c ''Ialion notes that whilst the news is encouraging, it shows that the Medina garrison is operating outside of Medina, and that it is necessary to do whatever can be done to encourage the Arab tribes into more energetic offensive ; the ea est, most eflective and, in the end, cheapest way of doing this would be a demons- ia ion rom Akaba against the railway. General Murray’s latest information, he adds shows that Ababa has been more strongly fortified than was anticipated. In his 1 tk A i°k 6 j ' Au g ust ’ General Clayton said that the latest information in regard to the Akaba garrison pointed to its consisting of about 150 men. The Sherif s Subsidy. forwaWE-iff A g “ St i Colonel Wilson inf °™ed Sir H. McMahon that he had not 1 , ‘ ,. r’ Anf 1 S eU ! Jr „ t0 ti,e Skerif informing him that he would be given a subsidy of 125,0001. a month for four months.Colonel Wilson said that the Sherif could not obtain much regular revenue for some time, and that he (Colonel Wilson) did not see how the Sherif could carry on without considerable financial assistance. He strongly urged that the monthly allowance should continue for a year at least. He said that he was convinced that in the Sherif we were backing the right horse, and that much depended on how we treated him during- the next year or so ; that we had a unique opportunity, which might never occur again, of ^curing through him an important influence in. and perhaps a certain control over, Moslem opinion and policy throughout the world—whole-hearted support now would repay us enormously. He added that the Sherif recently told Mahomet Massif (a reliable man, who is his confidential religious agent at Jeddah) that about a month ago Germany and Turkey offered him complete independence and whatever money he wanted if he would cease the revolt. The Sherif replied that he would have nothing to do with them. Colonel Wilson expressed his belief in the accuracy of this. Sir H. McMahon [No. 691] reported this on the 14th August, and endorsed Colonel Wilson’s request asking permission to substitute in his letter the words “ for the present ” instead of i£ for four months.” He realised, he said, that since he suggested a limit of four months on the 30th June the Sherif’s prospects ot ultimate success had greatly increased, and in the same ratio the importance to us of his success and the need of ensuring it. The Foreign Office sent a telegram | No. 678] to Sir H. McMahon on the 15th August authorising him to make the change he suggested in his letter to the Sherif. The Sherif and Colonel Wilson. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 14th August [No. 69-] that Colonel Wilson had reported that he had been cordially welcomed by the Sherif on his appointment to Jeddah. He was proceeding to Yambo to see the Sherif’s sons, Ah and Faisal, and to discuss their military situation—this by arrangement with the Sherif. French Mission to the Sherif. Sir H. McMahon reported on the 14th August [No. 693] that_the French Minister had informed him as to the proposal of his Government to send a mission to congratulate the Sherif. Sir H. McMahon said that he understood that the mission would also arrange at Jeddah for the reception of 500 selected pilgrims of good - status whom the French Government proposed to send from Morocco, Tunis, and Algiers. The Proclamation. Sir H. McMahon reported on the 14th August [No. 695] that the Sherif continued to urge that it was desirable that the original proclamation shou d e pu is e m Egypt, and that the Sultan also desired that this shou d be done. He himseli considered that the time had arrived when publication should be allowed m Egypt, and asked whether there was any objection to this being done. i • u i i r In this same despatch Sir H. McMahon also reported the formal withdrawal of the French objections to publication; objections which the French Minister stated had been based on small technical points, which had been misunderstood m the brief summary of the P g° e cl ^^ r n reported that Sherif had informed Colonel Wilson that he had already sent the original proclamation to India. The Turkish Government and the Revolt. One agent reports [06839] that the Turks attribute this to British g-old and the ruthlessness of Djemal Pasha. Another [06772] that the Turkish Government threatened to confiscate all the real property of Arabs, and to send a large expedi ion if propaganda fails. Opinion in India. On the 16th July Sir G. Boos-Keppel, in a private letter to the Viceroy, wrote as follows of the reception of the news of the Shenfs revolt m the 01 Provinces:—1 WIFI l &lt;£ The news was at first received with incredulity, but the English-owned and Indian press have combined to confirm the truth of the news, which is now generally believed. The people suspect that we have engineered the revolt, but the feeling ^ has not yet gone beyond suspicion, though that suspicion is almost universal : if they get definite proof of the correctness of their suspicions, the effect on feeling may be very serious. I say £ on feeling’ advisedly, as at present thep* seems no prospect of the news causing any actual outbreak ” Writing at about the same date to the Foreign Secretary of the Government of India, he said that: ££ The arrival in Peshawar of the £ Sadaqat ’ of the 11th July, with the columns referring to the Sherif blacked out d la Basse” had ££ caused a good’ deal of unfavourable comment.” THE AEAB BUREAU. The report of the Bureau for July has been published, and the following are the principal points contained in it:— 1. It has issued provisional handbooks of Asir and Hejaz. 2. The “ Arab Bulletin ” is to be printed for the future. 3. General Clayton s absence caused a great increase of advisory work to fall on the assistant-director. 4. The Bureau had also been required to perform multifarious executive functions of a staff character which were outside its normal province ; it must continue to perform this work until military operations and measures in regard to Hejaz are included in the purview of the Egyptian command. 5. The collection of other than Hejaz intelligence and all research work had, almost entirely, to stand over. 6. It is to be hoped that with the appointment of permanent and salaried assistant- director, inspectors, and clerks its work will be able to develop. 7. With the installation of Miss Gertrude Bell as correspondent at Basra, information from Mesopotamia greatly increased in quality and quantity. 8. There appears to be still some confusion in Mesopotamia as to the status of the Bureau, its relation to the Foreign Office, and the relation of the Basra political department to it: and it is suggested that an explanation should be sent from London. MASKAT. [Nik] KOWEYT AND THE TRUCIAL COAST. [Nil] BAHREIN. [Nil.] PART II. POLITICAL NOTES FROM THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. I he G.O.C. Aden reported on the 9th, 11th, and 12th August that the situation was unchanged. # * , South Mesopotamia. A number of documents have been received from Sir Percy Cox, addressed to the irector Eastern Bureau, c/o Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence : they are copiesof documents sent by Sir Percy Cox to “ The Officer in Charge, Cairo Section, Eastern Bureau, Cairo.” None of them are of sufficient current interest to print in the Appendix, but the sending of them suggests the idea that there is some misunder standing at Basra in regard to the Arab Bureau. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. Armenian Massacres. An agent reports [06870] that the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, referring a few days ago to a detailed report on the Armenian massacres received from M. Callerghis, Minister at Constantinople, stated that it was estimated that 800,000 Armenians had been massacred. Turkish Deserters. An agent [06836] gives the newspaper “El Balag” for the 20th June as his authority for the statements that all deserters were in future to be condemned to death, and that ten had already been crucified at Damascus and eleven hanged. The Turkish Opposition in Switzerland. An agent reports [06805] that several members of this party have again met in Switzerland, and that:— 1. They are persuaded that the time is ripe for a revolution in Turkey; for which they suggest the ground should be prepared by an extensive distribution of pamphlets and leaflets dropped from aeroplanes, particularly in the Smyrna district. 2. They propose to get into touch with Bahmi Bey at Smyrna, and if he should be willing to move, they wish to know whether the British Government would help him, and if so to what extent and in what manner. PART IV. THE PRESS. Syria. Syrians starved. The state of the people of Syria is past all belief, and many hangings have taken place. They are not exactly hanged, but suspended from a frame vuth their toes on a stool, which they often kick from underneath them. There is a new terrorisation of the Arabic-speaking Moslems. It is estimated that from 60,000 to 80,000 have died of starvation in Northern Syria. The process of Turkifying this country is being carried out with great thoroughness. The unfortunate people who are deported are made to give up their holdings, and the Turkish Government then sells the land and promises them that they will have similar allotments granted them in the north or in Angora. They are then transported and sent to Sivas or some similar town, where they find that the Turkish Government has done with them. This has been the procedure in thousands of cases, and the depopulation of Syria is fast proceeding. In some of the vilayets there are none of the Arabic-speaking Christians left. The typhus epidemic everywhere gains new impetus, and a great number of the Turkish army doctors have succumbed to it. Many of the civilian prisoners, mostly British, have contracted the disease, and at least twelve Englishmen M 7 ere ill with it, but recovered.—(The “Times,” 12th August.) [ 898—3] C6 ml 3- u &amp;£■ ' Neutral Aid for Syria refused, Washington, 11th August .—Turkey has refused to grant the request of the United States to permit a neutral committee to distribute relief in Syria, where thousands are reported to be starving.—(Reuter, “ Times,” 12th August.) r 1. German Activities. Enemy Propaganda Writing from Berne, Mr. Julian Grande gives in the “ Daily Graphic ” (2nd August) some astonishing facts regarding Germany’s propagandist activities in Moslem lands. After remarking that he is assured from a perfectly trustworthy source “that her budget for propaganda in Switzerland alone for the last two years has amounted to 2,000,000 M., which does not surprise us,” he proceeds:— “ I have no means of knowing what she has expended upon propaganda in Mohammedan lands, but it must be also a considerable sum, for, according to one of our Egyptian fellow-subjects, Mr. Aly El Gha’iaty, she has, to his certain knowledge, published and circulated in these countries seventy-two different pamphlets, and, of course, there may be others which he has not succeeded in discovering. “ The pamphlets are published in a variety of languages, principally Turkish, Arabic, Persian, Tartar, Hindustani, Chinese, and modern Sanskrit. Some of these productions bear on their covers the statement that they were printed in Paris or London; but most ostensibly proceed from Zurich, Rio de Janeiro, or some neutral European capital. Some are illustrated, some actually printed on art paper, while in order the better to impress the Arabs and Persians in particular, the writers of pamplets intended for them have blossomed forth into poetry. “ As for the contents of these precious productions, they may be judged from some of their titles : ‘ A Verdict on England,’ printed in Berlin ; ‘ British Atrocities,’ ‘Russian Cruelties,’ ‘French Lies,’ and ‘French Intrigues against Islam.’ The so-called Young Egyptians, or Egyptian Nationalists, who idle about the lake promenade in Geneva, and who are not, as a rule, true Egyptians at all, but Levantines and nondescripts generally, have, of course, been pressed into the service. If those for whom these pamphlets are destined could but see the individuals whom Germany has employed for their writing, they would scarcely be edified. Nowhere are these ‘ Young Egyptians ’ looked upon with more contempt than in their headquarters, Geneva, where no serious newspaper will have anything to do either with them or with their silly resolutions.” [This was taken from the “ Near East” of the 11th August.] 2. Rumours from Paris. According to a statement of the “ Frankfurter Zeitung ” from Constantinople, reliable information is to hand concerning differences which have arisen between England and Russia concerning essential points in connection with Persia. Shortly after the capitulation of Townshend at Kut-el-Amara, England expressed an urgent desire chat Russian troops should be removed from the English sphere‘of influence in Southern Persia. In London there was obvious depression at Russia’s failure to succour the English troops in Mesopotamia. Despite great resistance from the Russian military authorities, Sazonov acceded—at first hesitatingly and finally absolutely—to the English desire. After Sazonov’s fall, St firmer endeavoured to go against this promise. It is no mere circumstance that the English Embassy at Tehran, for the first time, should have its summer residence at Ispahan.—(“ Kblnische Volkszeitung,” August 7.) [This was taken from the “Daily Review of the Foreign Press” (W.O.) for the 14th August.] 3. British Attitude towards the Moslems. An agent reported [06772] that in the “ Tanin ” (the organ of the Young Turk party) of the 28th July it was stated that the principal British political aim was morally to crush all Moslems. /APPENDIX I. Explanatory Note on Eecent Events in Hejaz. [N.B.—Ibis is the translation of a paper written by a Tunisian Moslem, which was kindly lent, with permission to print, by the French Embassy in London.] AT the moment when, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Mameluke Sultanate of Egypt fell before the conquering Ottoman, its dominions spread over four Arab countries — Egypt, Syria, Hejaz, and Yemen ; the two first of which were administered directly, whilst the other two were governed by Emirs and vassal chiefs. When the Ottomans had conquered Egypt and Syria by their arms and suppressed the Sultanate of Cairo, Yemen remained for half a century abandoned to its fate at the hands of the local Arab chiefs, only passing under Ottoman domination as a consequence of another conquest by arms. Ottoman domination over Hejaz, on the other hand, dates from the day when the Sherif of Mecca hastened to offer his submission with the keys of the holy towns and the relics of which he was the guardian to the new Caliph, the conquering Sultan Selim I, after he had been invested with the Islamic Caliphate by the last Abbasid Caliph Mutawakkil, who lived in Cairo destitute of any temporal power. The Sherif s voluntary submission won for him the good-will of the Turks ; he was kept at his post, and the Sherifate of Mecca has lasted even till now. Ottoman rule over the two shores of the Ped Sea needed, however, a more homo geneous administrative organisation ; the division of authority, throughout the whole of this district, between Arab chiefs, who were frequently too feeble to resist external pressure, was a political danger. Immediately, therefore, after the complete conquest of the Red Sea basin had been accomplished, a new province was formed —the Eyalet of Jeddah and Habech (Abyssinia), with Jeddah for its chief town. It included the coast of Hejaz and, on the other side, that of Africa; the latter comprising the ports of Suakin, Massowah, Zeila, Berbera, Obok, Tadjura, &amp;c., with the territory behind them. The Sherif (like all Arab chiefs enfeoffed in the new vilayet ) became by this fact a chief of the Hejaz tribes and the representative of the Caliph’s authority in the holy towns, with the obligation of occupying himself with the suitable upkeep of the pilgrimage places and the security of the roads which led to them. He was often appointed by Imperial firman on the nomination of the Vali; and he was always subject to dismissal. Matters remained thus till the beginning of the nineteenth century. Then the Wahabi revolt upset Hejaz, and the holy towns passed, with Jeddah, for a short period of three or four years, under the rule of the savage sectarians who aspired to better Islam by restoring its primitive simplicity. The Sherif of the day, Caleb by name, fled before the revolt from Hejaz, and was imprisoned at Salonika as a punish ment for negligence. The Empire was going through a very difficult period of trans formation, and had not sufficient forces at its disposal, so the new Governor of Egypt, Mehemet Ali, was charged by the Porte with the duty of calming the Wahabi revolt and reconquering the holy places for his suzerain. Mehemet Ali took the work seriously in hand, and, after two or three lucky campaigns, reconquered the whole of Hejaz, pacified the country, and drove the Wahabi leader to his dwelling-place in the midst of Nejd ; there he took him prisoner and sent him to Constantinople, where he was beheaded. _ . When he had put things straight, Mehemet Ali (who was credited at that time with ambitious views in regard to Hejaz, to be accomplished by the creation of a new dynasty of Sherds) obtained an Imperial firman investing a certain Sherif Mohammed Ibn Aoun with the Sherifate of Mecca. This nomination brought about dissension in Hejaz, and at the present moment there are two dynasties of Sherds—the Dewi Zeid and the Dewi Aoun—the former being the old and the latter the new dynasty. Both are treated on the same footing by the Sublime Porte, which is tree to fill the Mecca post from either and to revoke the nomination when it pleases. On the death of Mohammed Ibn Aoun, the creature of Mehemet Ali, the Sherif Abdul Moutalib was nominated to succeed him; he belonged to the old dynasty of the Zeid. This famous Sherif, who died a centenarian about the year 1882, several times filled the co\eted post at Mecca, but each time he caused difficulties at the Porte (as, for example, when he opposed the abolition of the slave trade) and was deprived. During the nineteenth century, for the greater part of which the dynasty of the Aoun) ( 8 ) was in power, the rights of this new line were established. Mohammed Ibn Aoun, the founder of the dynasty, was succeeded as Sherif of Mecca by the Sherifs Abdallah, Hussein, Aoun-er-Refih, Ali, Abdillah, and the present Sherif Hussein. The Zeid have failed, during these latter years, to produce men equal to the task, whilst the Aoun have always had scions of real worth, like the present Sherif; so that in spite of p suspicions suggested against them of being creatures of the Khedival family of Egypt, the Porte, dominated by Palace intrigues, continued to choose candidates from the Aoun. When the Young Turks came into power, the Zeid threw in their lot with the Committee of Union and Progress in the hope of working it in their favour. But no occasion arose for revoking the appointment of the present Sherif, a subtle politician, a faithful servant (!) of the Caliph, an honest functionary, a model administrator of the turbulent tribes of Hejaz, the vigilant guardian of the safety of the holy places, the peacemaker when the Arab chiefs of Nejd oi A sir broke out into mutiny or revolt. The present Sherif Hussein Pasha is a man of about 60 years of age ; his father, the Sherif Ali Pasha (a son of the founder of the new dynasty, the Sherif Mohammed Ibn Aoun), died at Constantinople about the year 1872 whilst awaiting his turn for nomination to Mecca. Hussein has spent nearly all his life in Constantinople, where he filled the honorary post of Counsellor of State. He is a bold and ambitious man, externally polite and self-effacing. Abdul Hamid, who thoroughly understood his character, had him strictly watched at Constantinople, and, whilst outwardly loading him with favours and courtesies, in reality regarded him as a very dangerous subject. During the period of despotism in Turkey he was regarded as a malcontent and credited with liberal ideas—of course, very unlike the European idea of liberty, and more like that of the desert Arab. A ll the same, he played a skilful game during the despotic period. Three months after the restoration of the Constitution in 1908, the Young Turks in their first fervour deposed the Sherif Ali of Mecca, who retired to Egypt, and then nominated the present Sherif Hussein, a malcontent under the old regime, and therefore in the eyes of the Young Turks, very Young Turks, a Liberal! Hussein, coming as he did after a time of injustice and iniquitous despotism, easily acquired great influence over the whole population of Hejaz, sedentary or nomad. The Young Turks were simple enough to encourage him to reconcile the Emirs of Nejd, which he heartily undertook to do, and with great ostentation made a notable tour in the interior of Hejaz. His offers of warlike service were equally T accepted, and during the Italo-Turkish war he was authorised to raise Arab contingents to help in the crushing of his neighbour, the famous Idrisi of Asir, who had revolted and had been subsidised by Italy. On his triumphal return to Mecca he was followed by Idrisi’s artillery, an Italian gift, and by the greater number of the chiefs of Asir in fetters. This raised his prestige in the eyes of the Arabs ; and it was clear enough that he was preparing to play a part hitherto undreamt of by the Sherifs of Mecca. Ambition aside, there was another motive predisposing him to revolt—the fear of dismissal. He was very fully informed as to all that his rivals, the Zeid, plotted against him; and in 1913 he must have seen the first step of the Porte towards his removal from office and the terrorisatiou of the Hejaz in the nomination to the vilayet of Hejaz of Colonel Wahib Bey, a man of the same type as himself. The difficulties created at the Porte by the too daring behaviour of the Vali (from whom the Sherif had at one moment taken refuge at Taif) coincided with the first indications of a general European conflagration, and the Porte elected to disavow and change the Vali, that thus h* might avoid the creation of complications at a moment when it was about to throw itself into a war against three of the Great Powers. Even if the new political horizon spread out before the eyes of the Sherif by the creation of the Sultanate of Egypt be disregarded, and it one follows the English Under-Secretary of State in his expression of English surprise at the news of the Hejaz revolt furnished by Reuter, that revolt can, in these circumstances, be explained; it is, from a certain point of view, the necessary result of events in Hejaz. In regard to the civil administration of Hejaz, when the Eyalets and the new administration division of 1865 were suppressed, the Eyalet of Jeddah and Hahecli disappeared and the new vilayet of Hejaz was formed; this consisted of the three sandjaks (prefectures) of Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah, with Mecca for its capital. The Ottoman Vali, leaving Jeddah, installed himself at Mecca, and the Sherif became more than ever simply a decorative personage. When the Constitution came, the sandjak of Medina became independent of the Vali of Hejaz and was placed immediately under the Minister of the Interior f rat Constantinople. This was a step towards the division of forces in Hejaz and the lessening of the importance of the high functionaries installed at Mecca—the Vali and the bhenf. The moment came when the wish of the Sultan to instal a Sherif at Medina was spo en of; a Sherif who was to be on the same footing as the Sherif of Mecca. And t e name of a Sherif of the Zeid dynasty was mentioned in connection with the new post. Ihe limit was reached. The Sherif of Mecca had conformed to the wish of the Forte m regard to the so-called modernisation of the administration of Hejaz by the gradual introduction of administrative reforms to bring it into line with the other vilayets, but they^ could never tolerate the cutting-up of the patrimony, simply decorative though it ^ might be, which had been handed down by their ancestors for close upon ten centuries. The people of Hejaz, on the other hand, who live solely on the profits of the pilgrimage, combined with the charity of the Government and the Islamic world, finding their interests injured by the actual state of war (which an active propaganda could easily so explain to them as to incriminate the Young Turks in their eyes), were disposed to accept any change which might procure a little more ease for them or restore the means of existence which in part they have lost. _ AH these intrigues centred in one man, originating with him or being either for or against him ; and that man being a bold personnage like Sherif Hussein, what happened was inevitable. APPENDIX II. Reasons for the Resignation of Khairi Effendi Shaykh-ul-Islam. [Translation of an article published in the “ Akhbar-el-Hart ” (Algiers) of the 28th July, 1916.] THE reasons which led, some time ago, to the resignations at Constantinople of Shaykh-ul-Islam Khairi Efifendi, and the substitution of a Young Turk (devoted to the Committee of Union and Progrbss), Moussa Kadhim Rey, are now known, Precise information coming from a sure source explains the change, which was a consequence of German intrigues. In the religious circles of Constantinople some hostile feeling was shown in regard to Germany, whose interference in the affairs of Turkey has been so disastrous to the &lt; )ttoman Empire. Outbursts in the religious schools placed under the direction of the Shaykh-ul-Islam, in which hodjas and cadis are trained, left no doubt as to this. Under German pressure, the Young Turks at the head of affairs decided that they would not accept for administrative posts candidates from these establishments, but would reserve the posts of hodja and cadi for pupils of lav schools founded by the Young Turk Government under German direction. The Ministry of Pious Foundations, in obedience to German agents, went so far as to order the prosecution of the masters of religious instruction who had taken part in meetings at which the “ goings-on ” of Germany in Turkey had given occasion for strong protests. Khairi Effendi did not fail to resist measures of this kind : German functionaries then exacted the removal of religious instruction from the programme of the high schools which provided for the education of officials, so as to withdraw their students from the influence of the Shaykh-ul-Islam. Other incidents sharpened the struggle between the Shaykh-ul-Islam and the Young Turk Government. Several Moslems who had been arrested and prosecuted for high treason for having preached against the Germans in the mosques were acquitted by*the “ Mahakem-ch’eria ” ecclesiastical tribunals, before which they it ad been taken. The German agents, profoundly annoyed with them, ordered the Young Turks in power to lessen the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts ; and so it came about that in Syria a certain number of hodjas who had been imprisoned for having spoken against the Germans in the mosques were, in defiance of Moslem law, tried and sentenced to death by the u Mahakem-Nidhamia.” The Shaykh-ul-Islam worked energetically against these innovations; far from paving attention to his protests, the Government decided that all lawsuits, other than [898—3] Dthose concerned with family law, should for the future be tried by the “ Mahakem- Nidhamia,” which practically meant the complete suppression of the power of the Shaykh-ul-Islam. This new state of affairs, which entirely annihilated the authority of the Shaykh- ul-Islam, made the position of Khairi Effendi an impossible one; disheartened and disgusted he tendered his resignation. The Young Turk Government, in agreement with the German agents, chose as his successor the advocate Moussa Kadhim Bey, a politician who had had no religious education and had no acquaintance with the questions which concern the Moslem religion. So out-of-place a nomination made a great impression on the religious circles of Turkey; no one can take the new Shaykh-ul-Islam seriously. The attention of the Moslem world had for long been drawn to the despotic rule of the actual rulers of Constantinople ; the circumstances of the resignation of Khairi Efiendi and the appointment in his place as Shaykh-ul-Islam, of a man possessing no ecclesiastical qualification for this high post, can only increase the indignation of all believers against the Young Turk Government. APPENDIX III. The Lies of the Young Turk Government. [From the “ Akhbar-el-Harb ” (Algiers) of the 14th July, 1916.] STUNG by the Hejaz revolt and the profound impression produced on the Moslem world by the energetic action of the Grand Sherif of Mecca, who has withdrawn his country from the Ottoman yoke, the Young Turk Government, in accordance with its habit, forges lies to create a diversion. For example, in an official communique of the 28th June, it alleged that British ships had bombarded defenceless places on the shores of the Bed Sea, and had fired on the sacred places, on mausoleums, and on mosques. This assertion is of course false in every particular. It is, in short, a matter of common knowledge that the British Government, like the French, has everywhere shown the greatest respect for the Moslem religion. British ships in the Bed Sea have never committed any hostile act which was not directed against the military organisa tion of the Turks. The Young Turk Government hopes, by its grotesque inventions, to excite the animosity of the Arabs against Great Britain, and to cover up the horrible sacrilege of which Ottoman soldiers were recently guilty in Mecca, when they fired on the sacred temple of the Kaaba ; but these childish falsehoods neither deceive anyone nor effect any change in the hatred and contempt felt throughout the Moslem world for these sorry Young Turks, who have nothing of the Moslem about them but their fez. APPENDIX IV. Moslems and their Holy Places. [Article published in the “ Indian Daily Telegraph ” (Lucknow), July 18, 1916.] NOTWITHSTANDING irresponsible and mischievous writings in certain news papers, we trust the feelings evoked by the recent events in the Hejaz among the Mussulmans of India will not be misunderstood. We hope this both in the interests of the general situation in the country, which has continued calm and unruffled throughout the crisis of the world-war, and of the peace and contentment of the 70 millions of His Majesty’s Indian subjects whose loyalty to his throne and person has remained steadfast and unquestioned. No responsible journalist can, of course, forget his duty to say or do nothing that might cause the slightest distraction to Government in its supreme task of organising victory. But it is equally his duty to keep it well and accuratelyinformed of the real state of public feeling. A newspaper that thrives by scare- mongeimg and detects a bloody revolution lurking behind every little innocent noise ot the hour, deserves something harsher even than the Press Act. But the newspaper that deliberately suppresses the truth, trifles with the deep-seated religious convictions of a section of the people, or fails to point out the gravity of any large movement of ▼public opinion is a traitor to the peace of the land. . I ns t ea d, therefore, of hastening to denounce the recent manifestation of Moslem feeling, the really helpful and serviceable frame of mind would be to try to understand it and gauge its true character and significance. No one with his eyes and ears about him can deny that the feeling exists in marked intensity. The resolutions adopted by the Council of the All-India Moslem League, of the provincial leagues of Lahore, Calcutta, and Madras, and by representative public meetings at various Moslem centres like Lucknow, Calcutta, and Delhi (the Delhi meeting having been summoned by almost all the notable Moslem religious leaders and presided over by the Imam of the Jam’i Mosque), cannot be set down to the wire-pulling of agitators and dismissed with cheap sneers. We know how deep and bitter is the resentment caused to Mussulmans by the mischievous and fatuous effusions of a few newspapers like the C£ Statesman,” and we can well respect and admire the self-restraint they are showing in face of such insult and provocation. But this restrained attitude of the Mussulmans, in spite of misrepresentation and calumny, should not blind one to the anxiety and alarm which have been agitating their minds since the news of the Arab revolt in the Hejaz was first published in this country. To understand this fully it is necessary to realise how a Mussulman looks at the situation created by the action of the Sherif of Mecca. The question is purely of a religious nature and goes to.the roots of the Moslem faith. First of all, it should be remembered that Moslems are enjoined by the most positive commandments of the Koran and their Prophet to keep the sacred soil”— where the Kaa’ba or the “ House of God ” is situated—absolutely immune from all manner of desecration, strife, and bloodshed. To preserve the safety and sanctity of the holy places is the supreme duty of the Caliph of Islam, who exercises it in trust for the “ faithful,” and who on that account commands the spiritual allegiance of the entire Moslem world. A petty Arab chieftain, like the Sherif, should first of all be “ capable of exercising supreme temporal authority and independent of all outside control,” and he should command the allegiance of all Moslems before he can assume the office of the protector of the holy places. What has alarmed the Mussulmans is that the Sherif of Mecca has no such capacity and even a temporary success of his action would imperil the integrity of their holy land. Some “friends” of the Mussulmans are congratulating them on the heaven-sent opportunity to appoint a Caliph who is directly descended from the Prophet. They do not know that the supreme attribute of the Caliph is his fitness and not his lineage. The Sherif of Mecca's assumption of the Caliphate by the simple fiat of a Calcutta newspaper will not do. For, to quote Mr. Ameer Ali, “ there cannot be two Imams coexisting at one and the same time.” The present lawful Caliph has not yet been deposed, and he can only be deposed “by the consensus of the people (Ijmat-ul-Ummat) for consistent and flagrant infringements of the rules of religion and law,” and not by the fatwa of the “ Statesman,” or of an Indian newspaper at Allahabad. It would be much more safe and proper and decent if these “ friends” of the Mussulmans left the Mussulmans themselves to decide a question which is of such vital moment to their faith. From this brief analysis of the character of the office of the Caliph as “ Servant and Keeper of the Holy Places,” one can readily see why it is that the situation in the Hejaz has caused the liveliest anxiety and concern to Indian Mussulmans. Those who have tried to belittle these feelings do not know the facts. It is not a matter in which the professional politician or agitator has carried all before him. No wire-pulling was needed in this case to get up clumsy shows and half-hearted demonstrations to impress or embarrass the Government. But, as a matter of fact, only a few public demonstrations of Moslem feelinir have been allowed to take place, owing to the good sense of Moslem leaders and their anxious solicitude to avoid any semblance of organised agitation. And yet the “Statesman” denounces them as “agitators . . . . ; who are in reality condemning the Government of India and are implicitly showing their sympathy with Enver Pasha.” The wickedness and levity of this statement can be explained only on the hypothesis that this Calcutta journal considers itself to be safe from the operations of the Press Act and can apparently indulge in cowardly slander and abuse of His Majesty’s loyal Moslem subjects with perfect impunity. It need hardly be emphasised that the Mussulmans have implicit faith in thepledges given to them by His Majesty’s Government that their holy places will remain free from interference or molestation of any kind. They also 'recognise that His Majesty’s Government, being at war with Turkey, cannct be expected to help His Majesty’s enemies in restoring their authority over the recalcitrant Sherif. Again, Mussulmans have no secular concern with the Turk, the Persian, or the Egyptian! Their first and foremost duty is to their own sovereign, whose beneficent rule and protection they enjoy and treasure beyond anything else. They cannot, however, be ' indifferent to the fate of the Hejaz to which they are attached devotedly and to which they feel drawn by the deepest and most sacred associations of faith and history. PBTHTKD AT THE EOKEIGir OFFICE BT C. K. HARKISOH. 17/8/1916.SECRET. APPRECIATION OF ATTACHED ARAB REPORT No. Ill (New Series). THERE is no matter of outstanding importance recorded in the accompanying report. However, there are points which will repay study. Colonel AVilson’s report deserves attention, as does the Sirdar’s covering letter to Sir H. McMahon, particularly his observations regarding propaganda. Sir P. Lake’s reply to the Secretary of State’s telegram shows that the Mesopotamian problem is rendered more difficult by our want of a defined policy ; it we knew precisely what our future administrative intentions with regard to that area were, the General Officer Commanding Force D would not be obliged to reply in such doubtful terms. Major Grey., late consul at Koweyt, is now in London. He states that the news of the Sherif’s revolt was received favourably by the ruling Sheikh and his people. ^ No reference to this will be found in the report, as no news has been forthcoming from Koweyt since the rebellion in Hejaz began. Ibn Rashid’s policy and movements will probably be more influenced by our military actions in Mesopotamia than by the Sherd s The Amir’s action in Kabul in suppressing reports of meetings would seem to indicate that he understands how to deal with Turco-German agents and their propaganda methods. _ . ... , „ The political news from the Caucasus is somewhat disappointing, it wou.d be of o-reat advantage if good political propaganda could be introduced into North Mesopotamia via the Dersim, but the Grand Duke’s forces are so isolated from our own, and are doing so well from a military point of view that we cannot expect much political co-operation. Should events develop in such a way that we re-establish touch with the Russians later on in the year, some advantage may be taken of the situation, for the present study and consideration of political plans contingent on possible military action is the limit of P The reluctance of the Arab prisoners to serve the Sherif as artillerymen might perhaps be overcome by a personal interview between them and the Sherit at Mecca , Egyptian gunners served in the Mahdi’s forces for many years with great effect, thong i alTfirst they were neither eager nor willing to serve. # . Mr. Cunliffe Owen’s article in the “New York Herald” is_exceedingly mischievous. Steps might be taken to ascertain whether or no the mischief is intentional.

Missions of Colonel Wilson and Captain Cornwallis to Jeddah. THE report of Colonel Wilson to the Sirdar is printed in extenso in Appendix (A), and that of Captain Cornwallis to the Arab Bureau in Appendix (B). Colonel Wilson remarks' in his report that the seriousness of the consequences to us if the Hejaz revolt should fail are too obvious to call for remark. Sir Reginald Wingate strikes the same note : “ It is needless to point out that the failure of the Sherifs movement would be disastrous to our prestige, and would gravely complicate our future relations with Mohammedan peoples; such assistance, consequently, as the Sherif requires from us, should be given him without stint, and despatched with the least possible delay.” This passage occurs in his letter to Sir H. McMahon, covering Colonel Wilson’s report. He says, too, that the part we have taken in the revolt will certainly be advertised by our enemies; and, therefore, in his opinion, we should “ seize this opportunity openly to espouse the Arabs’ cause, and, at the same time, to institute throughout our Moslem possessions an uncompromising anti-Ottoman propaganda.” The Haj. Communications are still in progress between the India Office, Simla, and Cairo. On the 21st July the Viceroy telegraphed that he proposed issuing a communique that the Government of India was glad to announce that all obstacles had been removed, but that there was a great shortage of shipping which would entail considerable delay. Mr. Chamberlain approved [P. 2906] subject to Sir H. McMahon being satisfied that [898—1] B41 local situation warrants and that quarantine arrangements are sufficient. Sir H. McMahon, in a telegram dated the 29th July [No. 637], protests against tendency to throw too much responsibility on him personally, the •Indian Government being as much in possession af the facts as he was. Mecca and Jeddah are now in the possession of the Sherif who is very desirous that there should be a pilgrimage this year. Sir H. McMahon will know more when Colonel Wilson has arrived at Jeddah. Issue of Postage Stamps. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 30th July [No. 639] that the Sherif had asked to be provided with an issue of postage stamps ; that he had had a suitable stamp designed ; and that he proposed having a small issue prepared as he thinks the political effect would be favourable as emphasising the Sherif s independence of Turkey. A Mecca Gazette. The “ Times” correspondent in Cairo telegraphed on the 29th July that the Sherif proposed to publish a weekly newspaper at Mecca which would be his official gazette. Position in Hejaz. The D.M.I., Cairo, telegraphed to D.M.I. on the 28th July [I. G., 1002] that at Medina the siege seemed to be practically raised; that the Sherif had begun to recruit for a standing army and had raised 1,000 men in three days; that he had asked for British aeroplanes and pilots to fly everywhere except in the neighbourhood of Mecca and Medina ; and that he pressed us to cut the railway as soon as possible. In addition to Haidar, who is said to be in Medina, the Turks have sent there Abdel Rahman el Yusuf, Assaid Shoukair, [and Mohammed el Azm, their three chief adherents in Damascus. He discredited report of Germans being in Medina—the fanatical towns folk would hardly allow such a thing. The Sherif has twice given assurance of his absolute solidarity with the Entente, and has offered one of his sons as a hostage of good faith. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the |6th July [No. 620] that the Sherif was asking for 2,000 Egyptian troops to help in the taking of Medina, and for a further 10.000 to be held in readiness. It is impossible to supply these troops. Sir H. McMahon added that he should he in a better position to judge the Sherd’s real requirements when Colonel Wilson had got into touch with him. The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 30th July [Baba, 45] that Yamboa surren dered to Sherif on the 27th July. Also that the Bureau had arranged to take off 2.000 prisoners and sick from Jeddah by instalments. The Arab Prisoners in Egypt. In answer to an enquiry from the Foreign Office [No. 618], Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 27th July [No. 621] that a selection was being made among prisoners of war in Egypt and in India of Arab officers willing to serve in Hejaz. The G.O.C. Egypt telegraphed to C.I.G.S. on the 30th July [I. A. 2266] that the Arab Bureau had intormed him that it was being found very difficult to persuade Turkish trained artillerymen to go, even under their own officers, to the Sherif; but according to a telegram of same date from Arab Bureau [Baba 45] to D.I.D., though they could not send much trained personnel, a heavy battery was going. Moslem Opinion, Opinion in Aden. The Resident wrote under date the 10th June that news of what happened at Jeddah had been spread in Aden among the Somali population by the Somali boys landed off H.M.S. “Fox,” and that it had been well received; on the 17th June he said that the news apparently had caused little or no comment among the Arab population, and that the local residents were much more interested in the consideration of the effect of the present situation on their trade than in the religious side ol the question ; and on the 24th June that generally it was looked on as a welcome relief,and that some of the travelled merchant classes were reported to go so far as to say that they would welcome British rule even in Mecca, as they know we should not interfere with their religion. The Resident also sent copies of two letters written to the Imam by Sultan Abdul Karim bin Fadl bin Ali the Abdali, and of one of congratulation from the Idrisi to the Sherif. The Abdali is distinctly anti-Turk, pro-Sherif, and pro-British. Of us, he says : The English came to Aden before the Turks came to Yeman, but they have not quarrelled with any of the chiefs about his independence in his own soil; on the contrary, we govern our country according to our own religion, and do as we like. Over and above this, they give us continuous subsidies, whereas the .Turk's came into the Yeman after them, fought with their co-religionists, and turned them out of their own dwellings. Opinion in India. From telegrams published in the “Indian Daily Telegraph ” (Lucknowi of [?] the 29th June it appears that opinion in India is far from being unanimous. Resolutions antagonistic to the Sherif were passed at meetings held at Lucknow (under the chairmanship of a lawyer) and at Calcutta, as well as at an emergency meeting of the Council of the All-India Moslem League. On the other hand, another telegram from Calcutta, dated the 25th June, published in the same paper, says that the Mohammedans generally are delighted at the news; and a telegram from Madras, dated the 28th June, said that one influential Moslem declared that the whole community was glad to hear of the Sherif s declaration of independence ; and another, that he was confident that, “ with British advice and guidance, the Sherif would perform an immense service to the Mohammedan world.” Opinion in Afghanistan. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 26th July that the British agent in Kabul had reported, in regard to the Arab revolt, that the Amir and his council were taking drastic measures to prevent dissemination of news or general discussion in Kabul. The Viceroy regards this as further evidence of the determination of the Amir not to be hustled into war by a popular outburst, and as an indication of his unwillingness to commit himself till the result of the revolt is clear. Opinion of Russian Moslems. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed from Petrograd on the 28th July 'No. 1193] that the Russian Government had informed him that but little impression had been produced on Russian Moslems by the rising. Opinion of Turks in Switzerland. Agent reports that the Turkish Opposition party in Switzerland is in favour of the Sherif 'being proclaimed Caliph in place of the Sultan ; that it is most anxious to help us in every way ; and that it is of opinion that the time is ripe for an extensive propaganda, in the form of pamphlets and leaflets, distributed among the Arabs and the Turks. Suggested Propaganda in India. On the 27th July the Viceroy telegraphed his views in regard to the suggestions made by Risaldar Major Gul Mawaz Khan in his interview with Sir Arthur Hirtzel: (1) that some (say ten) carefully-selected Indian officers from France should take leave, and find their way in twos and threes to Hejaz, where it might be arranged that the Grand Sherif should receive them and tell them his case. They would then go to India (still on leave), scatter to their homes, and relate what they had seen and heard; (2) that the Grand Sherif should put out a proclamation to the Moslem world, which should also bear the signatures of the leading Arab notables, and that a deputation of these notables, with facsimiles of the proclamation, should visit India and give lectures or hold meetings. The Viceroy says that, after very careful consideration, they had come to the conclusion 'that neither suggestion was _ really practicable. As regards the first suggestion, ten or twelve native officers would in any case have but little influence, if anv on public opinion, and in this particular case, being Government servants, they would be discredited ; and as regards the second, while there was no objection to thepublication of a carefully-worded proclamation, the arrival of an Arab deputation, under official segis, would be positively dangerous. Indian Moslem opinion is settling down to a satisfactory condition of quiescence : if the Sherif makes good his revolt Indian opinion may be- relied upon to resign itself to the fait accompli. Suggested Propaganda in South Mesopotamia. General Lake telegraphed to the Secretary of State on the 25th July in regard to the suggestions made by the letter in the telegram noted in the last report. The Secretary of State it will be remembered suggested a propaganda among the Arabs in favour of the Sherif s movement, and the possibility of starting a local Arabic newspaper. In regard to active propaganda, by us, General Lake is of opinion that in face of the apathetic attitude of the Arabs it would produce an undesirable impression, though the Sherifs proclamation, which might be distributed by suitable agents, would be likely to have effect. As to the proposed newspaper: this “ would need very expert and close supervisionand “ might very easily tend to force the pace unduly—- disadvantages which are considered to out-balance possible good. He says that the Arabic edition of the c&lt; Basra Times ” had been considerably improved, that a considerable number of copies of the Cairo newspapers “ A1 Umram ” and “ Mokattam” are distributed, and that the £&lt; Haqiqat ” also reaches them ; and suggested that a separate Arabic literary supplement should be issued with the latter. THE IDBJSI. The G.O.C. Egypt telegraphs to C.I.G.S on the 30th Jnly [LA. 2266] that it was at present quite impossible to get any of the Turkish trained Arab artillerymen to go to the Idrisi; but according to a telegram of the same date from Arab Bureau to H.I.D. [Baba 45] guns are going. IBN BASHID. In the last report it was noted that Mr. Chamberlain had suggested an attempt to reconcile Ibn Rashid with Ibn Saud. In a telegram dated the 25th July, General Lake says that relations with Ibn Rashid have been broken off, and intimates that there is no chance of arriving at a good understanding with him; efforts, however, will again be made when the Sheriffs proclamation is received as that will give a new opening. The Arab Bureau [Report 10, p. 6] reports that Ibn Tawala, with some 400 tents of the Aslam section of the Shammar, has quarrelled with Ibn Rashid ; it is reported that they are making overtures to Jabar of Kuweit. They are friendly. The Bureau also states [p. 7] that Ibn Rashid’s caravan is somewhere in the vicinity of Zuhair, the Sheikh of which place has refused him free access till he has answered a letter written to him by the C.P.O. on the 27th May. Also [p. 7] that the A.P.O. at Khamsiyah reports that there is no doubt as to Ibn Rashid being in constant communication with the Turks. MUSCAT. Nil. KOWEIT AND TRUCIAL COAST. Nil. PART II. POLITICAL EVENTS IN FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. N Mesopotamia. The Arab Bureau [Report 10, p. 7] reports under date the 12th June that “ G.O.C. XVth Division states that travellers, agents, &amp;c., all report that the Nejf Ulema are writing letters to the tribes stirring them up against the Turks and representing the British to be safer allies.”It also reports under date the 8th June that comparatively reliable news of the disturbances at Kerbela has been received at Nasiriyah, in the form of a letter written about the 18th May by Sheikh Attiyah Abu Galal, of Nejf—the most powerful secular authority at Nejf with inclinations strongly pro-British. From the sheikh s letter it appears that Turkish “ guns and bombs were directed on the Holy Places. Caucasus. Colonel Marsh telegraphed on the 25th July to the D.M.I. [T.L. 328] that on the 23rd July General Baratoff had reported skirmishes with the Kurds; and again on the 27th July FT.L 336] to say that the Grand Duke had decided that at present there was no need for an Arab expert on that front, but that he would give timely information if the occasion should arise. Colonel Marsh added that he gathered that the Grand Duke was not satisfied with the result of Prince Shahovskoi’s mission. t ; An agent of the Arab Bureau [Report 10, p. 7], who was lately with the Russian army near Mahidasht, puts the tribal elements assisting the Turks at some 3,000 1 and horse. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. Syria. An agent of the Arab Bureau states [No. 10, p. 1] that the Turkish Government appears to have adopted during the last few weeks [Report dated the 14th July] a policy of persecution of Arabs in Syria—at Jaffa alone fifteen to twenty ^y r ‘ a “ 3 hanged in one week, they having been accused of trying to foment trouble, though there had been no outward signs of rebellion. , ,, Another agent reports [p. 3] that the Government has placed guards on the crops in thf interior Q g f Syria, all of which must be sold to the Government at a price fixed by ^^Rs agent wrote : “ I cannot describe to you the black misery that prevails] at Outilias, Jedeide, Junie, and Burj, and in the neighbourhood, on accou^ of the amine He added [p. 4] that the famine had depopulated entire villages m the Kesrouan. Most of the sick whom the agent had visited had their bodies swollen from having eaten weeds from the fields. In the Beirut district from forty to fifty people die daily from want of food, and it is said that from twenty to twenty-five a day are dying in Damascus. C.U.P. and Sherif Pasha. An agent of the Arab Bureau reports that the C.U.P. is negotiating with Shenf Pasha in the hope that he may join them. This is believed to be m connection with a possibility of obtaining satisfactory terms of peace. Moslem Prisoners in Germany. The Arab Bureau [Report No. 10] states that a committee has been formed in Berlin to push German commercial and industrial interests after the wai, un er Ihe presidency of Baron Max v. Oppenheim. The committee is composed ot Arabs P Turks/Persians, Africans, Egyptian Nationalists and ndmns Gadhr part^ To assist the scheme the Germans are treating their African, Asiatic, and nd a prisoners well. German Moslem Division. On the 25th July an agent reported the formation of a new division composed of North African Moslem prisoners captured by the Germans on the French front. French Moroccans i the Turkish Army. The General Officer Commanding, Basra, telegraphed to the Director of Military Intelligence on the 24th July [I. G. 3350] that three Moroccans, who had belonged to.I : a French Tirailleur regiment, recently escaped from the Turkish army and reached Basra. 1 hey stated that they had left Constantinople 1,000 strong, with other French Moroccans; _ officered by French-speaking Turks; that many escaped en route for Bagdad, which they reached early in May ; that they stayed in Bagdad for twenty-four days and were then sent to Khanikin, whence 300 escaped to Russia. Ill-treatment of Indian Pilgrims by the Turks. Tii e A rab Bureau [Report 10, p. 5] gives the story of the ill-treatment of some Indian Moslem pilgrims a man and his family—who were in Kerbela when the war broke out. They were detained by the Turks, who issued orders that the goods and women of Indians were the legal property of those who plundered them. The family escaped after eighteen months detention. Ths man expressed the opinion that the lurks were no Moslems, and that they did not act in accordance with the precepts of Islam; they hardly ever saw a Turk in a mosque. He noted that the local Arabs disliked the Turks.APPENDIX (A). Colonel Wilson’s Report on His Mission to Jeddah. THE Grand Sherif appears to have started his revolt without sufficient preparation and somewhat prematurely; he has entered into a struggle which is taxing his powers to a high degree, and intrigue amongst his own people, which appeal's to be rampant, does not tend to make matters easier for him. I do not, however, feel much doubt as to his ultimate success, but to ensure this he must be kept well supplied with foodstuffs, of which he is in urgent need. _ _ There appears to have been some delay in forwarding foodstuffs to the Sheriff and one serious error as to amounts ; should any serious set-back to his forces occur ^ at Medina, the Sheriff will more than probably try to put the blame on the British Government, owing to supplies not being available when he expected them. The seriousness of the consequences to the British Government should the present Hejaz revolt fail is too patent to call for remark. _ . . , To facilitate matters of supply and communications between His Majesty s Government and the Sherif, I am strongly of opinion that a senior British officer or official who knows some Arabic and understands Arabs should be appointed, without loss of time, to be the representative of the British Government with the Sherif, having his residence at Jeddah. This representative should not be termed a consul, but a special British envoy, or given some similar status, he should have full power to deal with questions as they arise, on lines which would require defining. While I consider that such an envoy should receive his appointment direct from His Majesty’s Government, thereby greatly strengthening his hands, I do not propose that he should communicate direct with the Foreign Office, but be under the immediate orders of the high official who may be in charge of the military and political affairs of the Sherif; these duties, in my opinion, must be run by one official, it being almost impossible to separate the military operations from the political side. Such a division of responsibility must, I think, lead to confusion, and it would presumably entail two British representatives at Jeddah entirely independent of each other. The envoy would require the following staff to begin with : 1 A member of the consular service, who could eventually fill the position of British Consul at Jeddah, which, after the war, will, I imagine, become a port of considerable importance. 2. A British officer or official who knows Arabic and has had previous experience with Arabs. 3. A British doctor. . 4 A really capable and energetic Moslem doctor who has experience of the duties of Medical Officer of Health, who could be usefully employed to organise sanitary services, &amp;c., at Jeddah; under existing conditions Jeddah runs a very good chance of being visited by an epidemic of cholera, plague, typhoid, or some such disease. . . 5 At least two really capable senior clerks and intelligence agents, such as Hussein Effendi Rubi and Ibrahim Bey Dimitri, of the Sudan Civil Service. Until the British Consulate at Jeddah has been overhauled and put into a sanitary and habitable condition, the Envoy and his staff will have to live on a ship in the harbour, and a small launch, drawing not more than 2| feet will be necessary. ^ The existing method of communication with the Sherif would appear to be inadequate, it is certainly unsatisfactory, and unless there ps some permanent British representative at Jeddah the present confusion of the continual re( l]Jf sts ^ &gt;r SU PP ies ’ &amp;c will continue. It is somewhat difficult to know at present difficult to kn-w-n't mre^mt definitely whether a sudden request for supplies is an entirely new order or already included in a previous demand. A representative would be able to keep a record of and sift such demands settling any doubtful points on the spot. There appears to be a very real fear of a shortage of foodstuffs yjust before I left Jeddah Sheikh Mohammed-bin-Oreyfan informed me that a sheikh just arnved 10 m Medina had said that the ration issued to the Arab forces round Medina was one sheep for each seven men every two days, without any rice, flour, &amp;c., and also what wou [898—1]' ( 8 ) MBBh appear to be a somewhat serious point—that a large number of Arabs were still with the Turkish Medina force, and that others had left Sherif Faisal because they got food with the Turks and little with the Arabs. As far as^ I can gather the Sherif expects the British Government to supply the A whole of his force in the ilejaz, and possibly part of the population with foodstuffs. * If the Sherif s view is correct, the urgency of getting large quantities of supplies ready at f^nce is clearly indicated and of the first importance ; further demands for munitions of war may also be expected. I have no knowledge as to what extent the British Government encouraged the Sherif to revolt, nor as to how far it is committed, but it is obvious that if any respon sibility has been incurred the Sherif should receive the fullest possible support now, half measures may easily mean disaster and future trouble. should a British representative be appointed as recommended above, I suggest that supplies should be collected at Jeddah, where he would issue them as required, and not send to Port Sudan, which would entail an extra loading and unloading ; should be nb such representative, Port Sudan, as a supply depot, is preferable to Suez, as the Sherif s dhows could be utilised for transport purposes. If the depot is at Jeddah, a trained storekeeper and clerk will be necessary. I wo cargo steamers of about 3,000 tons, or at least one, should be detailed at once for transport of supplies work only. The Sherif appears, at present, anyhow, to be inclined to resent any British inter ference though this is possibly due to his fear that the Arabs should think that they had exchanged British for Turkish rule, &amp;c., and the general situation requires careful handling owing to the intrigues among the Sherif s own people. Captain Cornwallis informed me that when he was ashore with Sherif Faruki he looked into a cafe now used as a genera] hospital, and although he was only inside a matter of seconds, Sherif Faruki was furious at his entering the place at alh Again one ^ evening Sherif Faruki informed Captain Cornwallis that instructions had been received from the Sherif to the effect that no one was allowed ashore, and that communications were to be carried on in writing. Captain Cornwallis and I refused to accept such an_ order unless we received it in writing from the Sherif. . AfP' 1 ” a certain amount of argument, it was agreed that Captain Cornwallis, the Senior JNaval Officer, and myself could go ashore when necessary on business; we ascertained afterwards, and I have no reason to doubt its truth, that'Sherif Faruki’had enlarged on the Grand Sheriffs orders on his own account. All that the Sherif wished was that parties from the ships, &amp;c., should not land. Considering the state of Jeddah and the fact that Bamadan had begun, I did not consider that any objection could be taken to this, if the Sherif considered that there was any chance of a disturbance. follow a l ° W ° f n ° British intervention at a11 would, I submit, be an impossible line to The British Government should insist on an agent, as recommended above, being at Jeddah and on its being kept fully informed, through him, as to all movements and intentions of the Sherif s forces and on the Sheriffs taking advice should such be deemed necessary, more particularly with regard to the administration of Jeddah. The British Agent would take no active part in Jeddah administration, but would give his advice as occasion arose. The Grand Sherif should be instructed (or requested) o inform ms local representatives at Jeddah that, in regard to quarantine, sanitary, and such like matters, they should consult freely and accept the advice of the British Agent. Great care must, of course, be taken in so wording such requests to the Grand Sheiif as to allay any exciting fears that the British Government intend to take over the administration of Jeddah entirely and actively interfere with the adminis tration of the Hejaz, to do either, especially at present, would be a great mistake politically, and that we have no such intention should be made clear to the Grand bherif. Assuming that the Grand Sheriff is informed on the lines indicated above, on the grounds that the British Government must insist—in the Sheriffs own interests—that Jeddah shouM be properly run and the advice of its agent taken, the method of getting things done might well be left to the latter, who will not have an easy problem to solve and whose position will not be a “ bed of roses.” It might usefully be pointed out to the Grand Sherif that, should an epidemic occur m Jeddah, the fact will be proclaimed and the Pilgrimage and ordinary shipping and trade intercourse—which is so much desired by him—will be greatly interfered with. I am inclined to go so far as to recommend offering the Sherif to supply him with r ■' ra complete Quarantine and Town Sanitation Staff as may be required, who would, of course, be all Moslems. The British Government has the whip hand over the Sherif, as he probably could not exist without money or supplies ; advantage should therefore be taken now, tactfully but firmly, of the existing situation to make a start in introducing British influence on the lines—presumably already decided on—along which British relations with the Sherifis Government will run in the future after the war. As regards the howitzer batteries and other artillery which I understand is to be supplied, the personnel for which is to be provided by Sherif Faruki from Arab prisoners, I suggest that these guns complete should be sent to Jeddah and the personnel trained there, instead of in Egypt, for political reasons. C. E. WILSON, Commandant of Troops and Governor, Red Sea Province. Erhowit, July 7, 1916. This report was transmitted to the High Commissioner, with the following covering etter from the Sirdar :— gf r eCret ^' Governor-General Office, Erkowit, July 8, 1916. I have the honour to transmit the copy of a report received from Colonel C. E. Wilson on the subject of his visit to Jeddah. The substance of Colonel Wilson s recommendations has been already telegraphed to you, and I iiave expressed the opinion that his proposal regarding the despatch to Jeddah of a British representative is sound, and should be acted upon without delay. I take this opportunity to recapitulate the salient points of my recent telegrams connected with the revolt in the Hejaz . 1 The immediate despatch of all foodstuffs required by the Sherif is imperative if the latter is to keep his Arab levies in the field and the success of the Sherife movement be not gravely prejudiced. _ ,1 cm -r u wi u 2 The monthly subsidies in cash and kind asked for by the Sherif should be granted. This is all the more necessary if His_ Majesty’s Government is not in a position to arrange for a military diversion against the Turkish forces in Syria and elsewhere nor to offer the Sherif a suitable expeditionary force for service in Arabia. 3 The training of the “ new ” Arab army should be carried out in the territory of the Sherif at Jeddah, and all war material that we can provide and the Arab ex-prisoners and personnel required for the organisation of these troops should be senr to that P° a r * auine that the offioial announcement by His Majesty’s Government regarding the revolt is to pend its favourable development, and the issue by the Shent of his formal proclamation to the Moslem World. A draft of the latter proclamation, which I have seen appears to me to strike the correct note in the emphasis laid on the terri torial independence of the Arab State and hostility to the Com oittee of Union and Progress. The Pan-Ottoman policy of the latter is evidently approved by important sections of Moslem opinion in India and elsewhere : and the particulars of the assistance rendered by the British Government to the Arabs will certainly be advertised by our enemies We should therefore, I consider, seize this opportunity openly to espouse the Arab cause and at the same time to institute throughout our Moslem possessions an uncompromising anti-Ottoman propaganda, based on the new conditions obtaining in the Hejaz, and the Sheriff’s refutation of the spiritual claim of the Ottoman Sultanate. It is needless to point out that the failure of the Sherif’s movement would be disastrous to our prestige, and would gravely complicate our future relations with Mohammedan peoples; such assistance, consequently as the Sherif requires from us should be given him without stint, and despatched with the least possible delay. &amp; , I have, &amp;c.

He returned with the news that he had been unable to alter the Sherit’s decision, and that the latter hadinformed him that he no longer needed the Maxim battery which was to return to Fort Sudan. Hussein Effendi Ruhi handed to me on my arrival a report from Sherif Effendi Faroki for General Clayton (see Appendix II), three letters from the Sherif to the High Commissioner (see Appendix III), and a copy of a proclamation from the Sherif to the Mohammedan world (see Appendix IY). I understand that the gist of Appendices II and III had already been telegraphed to you. _ The proclamation was sent by the Sherif in consequence of a request by the Sirdar that he should write to the Abyssinian Kadis with a view to counteracting the pro- Turkish propaganda in that country. I understand that it has not yet been published, and will probably be altered in certain particulars. On the 29th June Colonel Wilson, Captain Warren, R.N., of R.I.M.S. “ Dufferin,’’ Major Pearson, Said Bey Ali, and myself, with the interpreter, Hussein Effendi Ruhi, went on shore to interview Sherif Zeid, the youngest son of the Sherif. After a hot and dusty walk of fifteen minutes we arrived at his house, which is near the north gate of the town, and were shown into the presence of Sherif Zeid, Sherif Naser Ibn Shukr, a relation of the Sherif. who has been many years one of his special messengers. Sherif Abdulla, a large and unattractive looking man of about 60, who maintained complete silence throughout the proceedings, and Jamil Effendi Rafei. I briefly introduced myself as the High Commissioner’s representative, and after giving a few polite messages said that I would defer the presentation of my letters until Colonel Wilson and Captain Warren had settled the question of the batteries. Sherif Zeid informed us that Sherif Faroki had just arrived from Mecca, and that he would send for him. Sherif Faroki arrived in a few minutes, and the matter was explained. The Sherif must have been informed that Colonel Wilson was in the house, as presently a message came up that he would like to speak to him on the^ telephone. Colonel Wilson and Said Bey accordingly went downstairs, and after some discussion it was decided that Said Bey should go to Mecca with two mountain guns and an escort of twenty men, and that the other four guns, the remainder of the escort and the Maxim battery, which the Sherif now said he wanted, should be sent to Rabigh under the command of the two Yusbashis. After arranging this, Colonel Wilson and Captain Warren went back to the shi,p, and Major Pearson, whom Colonel Wilson had presented on arrival as the representative of the Sirdar, and myself were left with Sherif Zeid, Sherif Faroki, and Jamil Effendi Rafei. I presented my letter of introduction to Sherif Zeid, and he at once went downstairs and informed his father, coming back with the message that I was very welcome, that Sherif Faroki was going to Cairo at once with ali his commands, but that he hoped I would stay as long as I liked. _ Sherif Faroki took up the line that he had his orders from the Sherif to discuss certain matters with the High Commissioner, that he had^a full list of all ^ his requirements and that therefore there was nothing which I could usefully do in Jeddah. I pointed out that I could perdaps expedite matters by telegraphing the gist of his requirements to Cairo, but his attitude continued to be so uncompromising that I was finally compelled to request Sherif Zeid to telephone to his father and ask him whether I was likely to be of any assistance as I had only come for that purpose, and if my services were not required I proposed to inform the High Commissioner of the fact and return to Cairo at once. On this, Sherif Faroki consented to accept my help. During this conversation Jamil Rafei and Zaid Bey had played the part of silent spectators, n Zaid Bey was throughout perfectly polite and cordial, but he did not once assert himself. He is obviously a nonentity and dislikes having any responsibility thrust upon him. During the course of conversation, as directed by his Excellency the High Commissioner, I had spoken of the pilgrimage and the importance of its being a success this year, and was assured that the point had not been lost sight of. shortly afterwards we, took our leave, after saying goodbye to Zaid Bey who was to return to Mecca that afternoon, and arranging that Sherif Faroki should come aboard the Dufferin about sunset. Both Major Pearson and myself went away with a strong impression that our presence in Jeddah was unwelcome, at all events to the two Syrians. In che afternoon I went ashore to bring Sherif Faroki off and was introduced to certain local notables, such as Sheikh Suleiman Qubil, the chief of the municipality, Sheikh Abdel Latif El Muzeini, the harbour-master, and Sheikh Rashid, Gallatly and Hankey s ^g ei R- Sherif Nazir Ibn Shukr, who was accompanying the batteries to Rabegh, and should have been on board H.M.S. “ Anne ’’ several hours before. He said that he had been saying goodbye to Sherif Zeid. I took him off with me but we were too late to overtake the “ Anne.” His absence was destined to have serious consequences, as the burada,to which he transferred, did not start till midday of the 30th, and by the time it reached Rabegh, the trouble, to which I shah presently refer, had taken place. Major Pearson was also on board the “Surada.” On the morning of the 30th June I had a long conversation with Sherif Faroki, in which he told me frankly the object of his mission. He also showed me his letter of introduction to the High Commissioner, of which a rough translation is attached | (Appendix V). The Sherif is very anxious to be officially recognised by the Allies, and has ordered Sherif Faroki to make a special point of this. He intends to send telegrams to each Government. He is very sensitive about the opinion of the Mohammedan world, but hopes that his proclamation will convince it of the righteousness of his cause. He also intends to conciliate the Azhar Ulema at all costs, and to start a press campaign in his own favour. I pointed out that nothing could help him so much as a successful pilgrimage, as his fair fame would then be spread all over the Moslem world. Faroki replied that this was fully realised and that the Sherif intended to begin by halving the pilgrimage dues. He then went on to say that the Sherif designed to assume eventually the title of the “ King of the Arabs,and “ Calipha of the Moslems, but that he wished to make his position thoroughly secure first. He realises that his present untrained bands are of little use in opposing the Turks, and therefore wishes as quickly as possible to form an army of about 30,000 men, of which the majority will be Hejaz Arabs, stiffened by all the Arab officers and men who can be obtained in the British prisoners of war camps in India, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. Sherif Faroki is empowered to ask the British Government to equip the whole of this force, to collect in Egypt all the Arab supporters from the various prisoners of war camps, and to help in every way possible the formation of the nucleus of the Arab army. Probably Aziz Bey El Masri will be asked to command. Faroki, after obtaining the approval of the British Government to the scheme in principle, will consult with the Arab officers now in Cairo and submit detailed and considered proposals. The ultimate intention which he frankly avows is to invade Syria as soon as possible. He has instructions to raise the Syrian territorial question, and to try to come to some arrangement with the French. As to whether the British Government will be asked to maintain the Arab army in the field depends on what other drains are made on the monthly subsidy of 125,0002. The Sherif is convinced that this sum has been promised to him, and wished it paid in gold at Jeddah commencing from the 1st July. His present immediate requirements are :— 1. 7,000 rifles. 2. 5,300,000 rounds S.A.A., i.e., at the rate of 650 rounds per rifle for the whole 10,000, since he says that the 400 rounds per rifle sent with the first 3,000 rifles were not enough. 3. 50 kilos dynamite to be used against the Medina Fort. Faroki intends to send an Arab sapper officer with this immediately on his arrival at Cairo. 4. 500 hand bombs. 5. 5 trained Moslem armourers for the repair of both rifles and guns. 6. 2 or 3 Moslem experts in explosives, about whom Colonel Wilson has already telegraphed to the Sirdar. The other things which he has already asked for, such as two more mountain batteries, a howitzer battery, 25,000 rifles, a field ambulance and two or four aeroplanes, form part of the scheme for the regular army, and will be submitted by Faroki later. The Sherif hopes and expects that the British Government will keep his present irregular force fully supplied and equipped. He will be glad to welcome a British consul at Jeddah shortly. He wants the Mahmal sent at the usual time. As regards the internal administration of the Hejaz, Faroki wishes to send some Mohammedans of experience from Cairo at once to reduce to order the chaos at present reigning. I do not think he has any cut-and-dried proposal to make. He is very anxious to secure the help of General Clayton in military, and Mr. Storrs in civil matters, and seems to have left the details for later decision. If His Britannic Majesty’s Government intends to afford full help to the Sherif, it will probably be necessary to form two Committees, one civil and one military, composed of British and Arab members, in order that a comprehensive scheme may be drawn up. Faroki also spoke to me of the rising which has taken place in Syria, and whichis generally considered in Jeddah to be of great importance. I heard several different reports. Faroki’s version is that the Druses have rebelled, and that Sheikh Nuri Shaalan with all the Boalla, whom he estimates at 15,000 fighting men, helped by Hakim Ibn Nuheid and various Arab officers refugees, has also revolted and entered the Yilayat of Damascus. He thinks that the operations will consist of frequent raids, for which Nuri Shaalan is most conveniently placed since he can retreat swiftly on Jauf, where he is out of reach of the Turks. His estimate of the Turkish troops in Syria is 10,000 Germans, 15,000 Turks, and 12,000 Syrians, the latter being chiefly officered by Turks, and therefore unlikely to move. Three hundred machine guns are said to have been sent recently from Constantinople to Syria. On the afternoon of the 30th I went ashore with Faroki, and accompanied him to the house of Sheikh Mohd. Nessif, the agent of the Sherif in Jeddah. Faroki wished to speak to the Sherif on the telephone, so I was taken to an upper chamber When we were alone Sheikh Nessif expanded after a few minutes’ conversation, and informed me that the merchants of Jeddah were looking forward with dread to being ruled by the Sherif, the Sherifs in the country were all corrupt and unreliable, that the town council was entirely unfit for its duties, that Sherif Mohsin, the military governor, was a harsh tyrant, and that all the merchants hoped that there would be some form of British control in Jedda. I made no comment on this information, and record it, as it i confirmed the opinion which we have always had, that the townspeople m the Hejaz are opposed to the Sherif. Sheikh Mohd. Nessif is a portly man of about 50, with a large benevolent face, black beard, and gold rimmed spectacles. His family migrated fromEgypt three centuries ago. He is one of the principal merchants of the town, and is said to steer clear of politics. n He enquired anxiously as to what had become of the steamship Jp iruze, a ship^ which had left Bombay two and a-half months before with about 70,0001 worth of goods belonging to Jeddah merchants, and had been stopped at Aden owing to the imposition of the blockade. The captain of the “Dufferin” kindly telegraphed the next day to Aden about her, and found that she had arrived at Aden from Colombo on the 5th May with a cargo of rice, sugar, and dhall for Jeddah, had been kept waiting for some time, and had finally discharged everything there, and returned to Bombay It would be an action much appreciated by the Jeddah merchants if something could be done to expedite the despatch of this cargo, and I suggest that the resident, Aden, be asked to look into the matter. run On our way back to the landing place we met the two guns en route tor 3 eddah, the Egyptian soldiers having discharged their straw 7 hats for kufiyas of a brilliant green and pink. _ . i 0 o During the course of the evening I received news that 98 tons of rice and 38 tons of flour had arrived at Port Sudan, and that a letter from the Idrisi to the Sherif would be there on the 5 th July. The Sherif was duly informed of this. Faroki also handed me a letter (Appendix YI^ containing the Sherif s ultimatum to the Turkish Government, in case any/jirm befell his brother Nazir Ibn Ah at Constantinople. This was forwarded to you in my telegram 606 of the same date. Late the same night came the news that there was trouble at Babegh. Colonel Wilson will doubtless submit a full report to the Sirdar in due course so I w 7 i merely recapitulate briefly what happened.' Soon after BJ.M.S. ‘‘Hardings ™l a t Babegh on the evening of the 29th July, an Arab came on board and was told that a ship was arriving next morning, and that as many dhov 7 s as possible were required. He promised to arrange and said that Sheikh Hussein Mabeinq would come off at 10 am HMS “Anne” arrived at 9 a.m. on the 30th, the dhow 7 s came alongside and proceeded to get ready to land the horses. The captain of B.I.M.S. “ Hardmge then lowered a boat and made towards the shore in order to arrange a place for the disembarkation. An empty dhow 7 from the “ Anne ” passed him on the way m, and he noticed the reis hastily collecting a number of men and send all the women and children inland. When he came near the shore about twenty men took up their position behind an upturned boat, levelled their rifles and threatened to fire if he came any closer. He accordingly returned, passing on his wuy all the^ dhows from the “ Anne ” and found that the reis had told an Egyptian officer that the soldiers c ? u l not be Moslems since they were not wearing hats; that no orders had been received about their arrival, and that they would not be allowed to land The captain repor e to Jeddah, and sent his interpreter in to try and get intc lA 0 ^ but without success. The interpreter was told by an Arab that the Sheikh had s would neither come off nor receive anyone on shore ^hout 5 ^ a 4t ^ ur ^ ,, f id clearly seen floating from one of the chief houses at Babegh. The Suradanext morning, and Sherif Nazir at once went on shore with the interpreter, but, after going a few yards, the latter was sent back. He was told that 9,000 Arabs had come down to oppose the landing; that there were four Turks in the town, and that had he gone on he would certainly have been killed. Sherif Nazir did not return till 7 p.m. when he said that Sheikh Hussein had objected to his landing because an officer had A told the reis of a dhow that the troops would be landed by force. This was obvioudv ^ ^ ' J .li v • i , i i it untrue. Sherif Nazir requested that the supplies might be landed and the batteries remain on board until he had communicated with the Sherifs Feisal and Ali. This would take at least four days. Major Pearson, in consequence of the attitude of the Arabs and of representations made by the Egyptian officers on board, recommended that the troops should be returned to Jeddah, and in this Colonel Wilson concurred. The blame for this unfortunate incident—and it was doubly unfortunate owino 1 to the urgent need of the supplies at Medina—rest primarily with the Sherif for neglectino- to warn Sheikh Hussein Mubeiriq, although Colonel Wilson had several times asked ^him to do so. Bad Sherif Nazir arrived in the first ship matters might have been arranged, but as it was a whole day passed, during which the interpreter picked up various alarming rumours from irresponsible people, which he spread broadcast through the ship. Sheikh Hussein Mabeiriq is supreme in his own territory, and has always been independent of the Sherif. He obviously did not want the troops, and Sherif Nazir’s request for a delay of four days was evidently in order that he might find out where else they would be landed. On the morning of the 1st July I went ashore to pay a call on Sherif Mohsin Ibn Mansur el Kanmi, the military governor of the town, who had arrived from Mecca the day before. The whole town was asleep, it being the first day of Ramadan. After bemg kept waiting for some time, I was shown upstairs and found him lying on a divan suffering from a high Aver. I therefore cut short my visit and merely gave him a message from Colonel Wilson about the happening at Rabegh. He asked me to inform the Sherif by telephone, which I did. _ The Sherif seemed to attach little importance to the incident, and said that Sherif Nazir would put things right when he arrived. Sherif Mohsin is a very fine type of Arab, tall and straight, with piercing grey eyes and' a black beard streaked with grey. He gives one a greater impression of strength and Soon after my return to the ship, Sheikh Ahmed Talaat, the clerk of Sherif Mohsin came on board and said that he had received a telephone message from the Sherif to ie fhect that too large a number of men had been going on shore from the ships, that the inhabitants were upset, and that he must therefore request that no one should land except the captain, Colonel Wilson, and myself, and then only when we had business. We informed him that the Sherif’s instructions would be observed, and that we ourselves wished to go ashore early next morning about the Rabegh affair. He accordingly promised to send horses to meet us and departed. Faroki, who had been summoned by the Sherif, returned presently and repeated the order, but said that it applied to all of us, and not only to the ships’ crews. I insisted on his giving me a written notification of this order, since it varied from that of the military governor, and &lt; T^V 1Un f ^ dl f usse d th e&gt; situation with Colonel Wilson and the captain of the xi 1 x tterm ‘ Earoki what was the real reason of the order, he replied that the town was perfectly safe, but that certain people had been saying that the Sherif was as much m the hands of the British as the Turks were in the hands of the Germans, and that rumours like this were causing harm. It was therefore necessarv that we should communicate any business we had in writing. He also said that Sherif Mohsin ad ommed soldiers to be at the landing-stage and that probably any attempt to land W °i bn r ® slsted - Colonel Wilson said that his business could only' be done on shore, and that the landing of the stores and batteries might be indefinitely delayed, and I miormed haroki that unless permission was given to us to land, I should be obliged to represent the matter to the High Commissioner. He then consented on condition that wee id not talk any politics in the town. At his urgent request, I tore up the written notification, which he evidently viewed in the light of a damaging piece of evidence against himself. From the fact that (a) the first remark of Sherif Mohsin at our next meeting was that we could come ashore freely whenever we had any business, and (/&gt;) that the Sherif next morning, without a moment’s hesitation, gave me permission to Msit the British Consulate, we were all forced to the conclusion that Faroki had H T te l eXCeeded tde Sherif’s instructions in the effort to keep us away from Jeddah. The same opposition had been showed to Colonel Wilson by Jamil Eff. before my arrival. The only reasons that we could think of were, firstly, that they wished to show the people that the Sherif could give what orders he pleased to the representativesof the British Government; secondly, that they did not want us to know too much of what was going on on shore. I am certain that the Sherif intended no discourtesy. I was the more surprised at the suspicion and distrust shewn by Faroki on these two occasions as on all others he has been perfectly frank and friendly. Colonel Wilson, Captain Warren, Faroki, and myself, went ashore early on the 2nd July, and proceeded straight to Sherif Mohsin’s house. The police, with whom Faroki had threatened us, were so far absent that we could not find one to show us the way. We found Sherif Mohsin better, but hardly able to stand. He had asked for the ship’s doctor the previous day, but as Faroki had objected, saying that tho Sherif’s own physician was attending him, we had not pressed the point. It subsequently came to light that Sherif Mohsin is in great dread of being poisoned by this physician, and so was not very appreciative of the Sherif’s care of his health. Our visit only lasted a few minutes, and after failing to get any reply to our telephone calls downstairs, we went round to the exchange. After waiting nearly an hour the Sherif came to the telephone; the matter was explained to him by Faroki, and he at once said that everything should be landed at Jeddah. Disembarkation accordingly began the same afternoon. While we were waiting the following telegram came for me from him :— “ To the Honourable Captain Cornwallis, “ Representative of his Excellency the High “ Commissioner on board the man-of-war off Jeddah. “ As soon as you receive this please forward it by wireless to his Excellency in Egypt. Said Bey has arrived Mecca with two mountain guns and has been making difficulties. He asked for an ambulance and an armourer for the two guns which we gave him in order to simplify matters. He is now making further difficulties which will not be to the good of the common cause. I beg that you will either send two aeroplanes as soon as possible to destroy the fort at Taif, which is about 150 kilometres from Jeddah, or order Said Bey to go to Taif, or send two quick firing guns of the latest pattern in addition to any asked for before. Please arrange one of the above alternatives as soon as possible. I beg you to reply. I urgently request you to give orders to whom it may concern to prevent the officers with the guns going to Medina from acting in the same way. “ Sherif and Emir of Mecca, Hussein. “July 2, 1916.” About half an hour after the receipt of this, a message came through to cancel it. Evidently Said Bey had been asked to do something which was impossible from a military point of view and had refused. The employment of Egyptian troops in the j Hejaz is unpopular both with the Arabs and the Egyptians themselves. On leaving j] the landing-stage ou the way back I was handed two letters for the High Commissioner and one addressed to myself (Appendix VII). The latter contained a request for 250 tents, and stated that the monthly requirements starting from the 1st July would be 50,000 okes of flour, 70,000 okes of rice, 2,000 okes of coffee, and 2,000 okes of sugar; three quarters to be landed at Rabigh and one quarter at Jeddah. As the Sherif is reckoning to feed not only his army, but also the indigent civil population it appears probable that the above is underestimated and that a further demand till be received shortly. Faroki also informed me that the Sherif wished three quarters of the supplies still due to be landed at Rabigh and one quarter at Jeddah, and that he was very anxious for two ships to be detailed permanently for his requirements. The Sherif also wants a sea-going yacht manned by Mohammedans, a request which I did not think necessary to forward by telegraph. About sunset, Faroki brought a letter from the Sherif saying that he had heard from Sheikh Hussein Mabeiriq that the ships had arrived and that everything was being taken off. At the same time the ships themselves arrived back at Jeddah. Early on the 3rd July Faroki came to me to say that he had had a message from the Sherif that he very urgently wanted 1,000 rifles, with 1,000 rounds per rifle, at Rabigh. It appears that the Medina garrison, which numbers about 7,000 men, made a sortie from the town and inflicted heavy losses on the Arabs. As Faroki says that the Arabs only number 9,000 men, Medina cannot be seriously besieged. The Sherif also sent a message complaining once more of the Japanese riflles, and requesting that an officer should be appointed to see that only articles of good quality were sent, to him.It has been stated that 20 per cent, of the Japanese rifles have burst, mostly after firing a few rounds. I repeatedly asked to be given as many of these as possible, in order that they might be examined in Cairo, but no notice was taken of my request beyond the usual vague assurances that they were being sent. One of the burst rifles was shown me on my arrival; but I had little time to examine it, and was unable to recover it subsequently. The_ Sherif also sent a message to say that he no longer needed any Le Gras ammunition. It appears that he has been wanting this for several months, and that there is no such ammunition as Aza, for which we have been searching. The confusion was due to the translator’s mistake. As I thought that the High Commissioner would like to know the condition of the British Consulate, I obtained the keys from the Chief of the Municipality and went over it on the morning of the 3rd. The Consulate is a large four-storied building facing north, situated a few yards from the North Gate. It needs colour-washing and paintino-, but no structural repairs. The only furniture left consists of three or four cheap cup ooards and a few old chairs. There are two safes, which were opened by the Turks and of which the keys are missing. I was informed unofficially that the Sherif did not want the British Consul to hoist the British flag for the present. I took no notice of this, and. as matters stand, the Sherif has agreed to allow him to come in under a month. I strongly urge that the appointment be made without delay. If it is undesirable to give him the title of Consul, he might be called Assistant British Agent, and work under the officer whose appointment I have recommended on the last page of this report. ” J transferred to R.I.M.S. “ Hardinge ” during the course of the afternoon. Faroki who had been summoned on shore by the Sherif, returned with a message that no more stores were to be landed from H.M.S. “Anne,” and that sambuks would be sent next morning to take them to Rabigh. I flagged this further change of plans to RIMS “ DufFerm ” as we steamed out. Faroki also gave me a letter from the Sherif (Appendix VIII) in which he complained that the failure to land the batteries and supplies at Rabigh, in spite of the assurance irom the Sherif Nasir and Sheikh Hussein Mubeiriq that it would be safe to do so, had adversely affected his position at Medina. The facts of the case had evidently been misrepresented and all the blame placed on us. We arrived off Yenbo at 9 a.m. on the 4th instant, and Ruhi Effendi was sent to find £ Ut 1 au teS ^?? WS ;! crowd c . ollected &gt; and presently a big fat man, who called imself Sherif Ibn Abdullah, came off in a canoe. He said that Yenbo was in the hands oi the Sherif that the tale of the Germans and their women, previously reported, was untrue, and that there were no Turks in the town. Having ascertained that the’ship had no supplies for Yenbo, he said to Ruhi : “ You cannot land. Go away quickly.” His attitude was the reverse of friendly. On his return Ruhi saw a dozen Turkish rLii' 8 ^ P r °kakle that Yenbo is in the hands of the Arabs, who care as little lor the Sherif and the English as do those of Rabegh. Jamil Effendi Rabei.~On my arrival at Jeddah I found that Jamil Effendi Rafei who is an employe m the Sudan Agency, in Cairo, and who was sent to Jeddah as the secretary of Faroki, had been treating the English officers there with consistent rudeness, At the first meeting between Colonel Wilson, Captain Warren, tnd Sherif Zeid he had sat on a table with his tarbush off, and had neglected at any time during the conversation to give Colonel Wilson the titles which his rank of Pasha demanded. This was a deliberate act of discourtesy, as Jamil Effendi is a Government servant and cannot plead ignorance. He told Colonel Wilson that the Sherif had appointed his Civil Repre sentative in Jeddah, a statement which was not in accordance with facts On two occasions { he was very rude and off-hand to the Captains of R.I.M.S. ‘‘Bufferin’’ and . . .b Hardinge, and actually paid a call on the latter in his pyjamas. At my first meeting with Sherif Zeid he repeated to me the tale that he was Civil Representative m Jeddah and added that Sherif Zeid was merely looking after some arrangements about camels I had to check him sharply on two occasions during my interview with S enl Zeid, firstly, when he rudely snatched up my letters to the Sherif, which were ymg on the table at my side; and again, when he broke into my conversation with 4 i ar °n 1 m dur y :is ( 1, I believe that the Sherif was also annoyed with him. He lived in 1 ^ Governor s house, and in about two days after his arrival had gained complete influence over Sherif Zeid and was managing all the affairs of the town. He sent a letter purporting to come from Sherif Mohsin to the Sirdar, in which he very broadly hinted that Colonel vYilson would be doing better work governing his province. I showed the letter to Sherif Moshin afterwards. He was very annoyed, and said thatboth Jamil and Faroki were no better than Turks, and that the letter was a complete fabrication. Jamil Effendi made no difficulties about returning to Cairo. Re-opening of Trade. —In Appendix III will be found the Sherifs request to re-open the trade of the whole Hejaz coast. I have already telegraphed to you about raising the blockade as far south as Lith, which the Sherif wishes to use as his port for provisioning the Azir army. In this connection I would point out that the re-opening of trade will only mean a return to the conditions of two months ago. To allow the passage of such things as sugar, petroleum, and other luxuries, it is necessary to cancel the existing regulation and publish a new one. I recommend this being done in the case of Jeddah on bn A cone of sugar costs 8s. in Jeddah, and other commodities are in proportion. It is very necessary that prices should be normal before the influx of pilgrims. Turkish Prisoners. —There are about 1,700 men and 60 officers in Jeddah. The officers live in houses in the town, the men in barracks at the south-east corner of the town. Faroki asked me to go and see them one afternoon, but afterwards said that it was inconvenient. Officers’ servants are freely allowed into the town to buy food. Faroki separated the Arabs from the Turks, and made certain changes in the diet. I have no reason to believe that the prisoners are not being well treated. The Sherif evidently intends to keep them as hostages. Cable. —The cable ship “Cambria” was expectedly shortly at Jeddah. It is not anticipated that extensive repairs will be necessary. The Sherif does not ^ want the Eastern Telegraph Company to have to do the working of the cable. He intends to have his own staff both at Jeddah and Suakin. Conclusion. —The fort of Jiyad, with its garrison of fifty men and three or four guns, has fallen, and there remains the larger force of over 800 men defending the barracks. This force possesses no guns, and is said to be holding out chiefly owing to the Sherifs desire to avoid bloodshed. The Egyptian batteries will probably force it to capitulate. Taif is a more difficult problem, but may reasonably be expected to surrender in course of time. Medina is the danger point. The garrison there is said to number 7,000 men, and is commanded by an energetic general, Fakhri Pasha. He has already made a sortie from the town, and inflicted severe losses on the Arabs, who altogether do not number more than 9,000. There is always the possibility that he may try to march south and force an issue with the Sherif. The water and transport difficulties are immense, but not insuperiable. Our experience at Habegh and Yenbo showed how slender is the Sherif’s control over the Arabs in the outlying districts. Another defeat might have serious effect on their morale. The Sherif has no trained officers of any sort with him—but only tribal sheikhs leading their undisciplined followers. It is important to send back by H.I.M.S. “ Hardinge ’ an Arab military mission. They will put new life and confidence into the Arabs. To conquer, or at any rate contain, the Medina garrison is the most important question at the moment. The Sherifs dream of an advance on Syria is impossible of realisation for a long time to come. . Government in the Hejaz is in a state of chaos. There is no one who has any idea of organisation. The smallest details are referred to the Sherif by telephone, and he can have no time to work out a proper scheme of government or see things from a broad, standpoint. The townspeople of Jeddah think well of him personally, but fear his Sherifs, and are equally suspicious of any Arabs who may be sent from Cairo to govern them. The Sherif, in order to conciliate both his own Sherifs and the Arab party in Cairo, is going to put the former in as Governors, the latter as their Advisers. This means a double pay-list and, perhaps, a two-fold toll from the merchants. ^ Jeddah is at present a hotbed of intrigue ; all the chief men are striving to secure a niche for them selves, and are quite indifferent as to the means employed^ to gain their ends. The townspeople hate the Arabs, the Arabs return the feelings with interest and are deeply suspicious of each other. Broadly speaking they are divided into two opposing factions, the one led by Sherif Mohsin and the other by Abdel Latif El Muzeini, ttm harbour master. The agent of Sherif Mohsin told me himself that neither he nor his master dared to eat or drink outside of their own house, and, doubtless, their opponents are equally careful. _ . -p . . , The most satisfactory way of administrating Jeddah would be to appoint a Adviser to a Hejazi Governor like Sherif Mohsin. _ The Arab party in Cairo who do not want anything from England except an unlimited supply of gold supplies an munitions, would cry out that local Moslem opinion would never sanction this; but the fact that Sherif Mohsin has himself said that he would welcome an English Adviser shows that their objection is without justice. It would be advisable to give such an.Adviser some unpretentious title, so as to avoid drawing attention to his real functions. These would be to act as the connecting link between the British Government and the Sherif, with a free hand to settle all questions of detail as regards the landing of stores and the like, and also to exercise an undefined though real control over the organisation of municipal afiairs at Jeddah. In addition to an official with consular experience (to be called his Assistant), he would require a British officer to assist him and a small staff of clerks. It would also be as well to send a trustworthy officer of the Egyptian Army who has had experience as a Mamur in the Sudan. The alternative is to send a Native Adviser nominated by the Arab party. There are several obvious advantages in this if a man with suitable qualifications could be found, but, so far as I am aware, the Arab party has not yet indicated any candidate who is both experienced in the affairs of Government and at the same time a proved friend of Great Britain. To send a man of the type of Jamil Eff. Bafel would be fatal to British and Arab interests. I therefore recommend, in the absence of any suitable Arab candidate, the immediate appointment of a Senior British Officer. The Sherif has not yet fully realized his responsibilities at Jeddah and may possibly put forward an objection. He has, however, always shown himself to be reasonable and can doubtless be convinced of the importance of establishing an organized svstem of Government before the beginning of the pilgrim season. The local Town Council is doing its best but does not know where to begin. There are two or three indifferent doctors in the town. What is wanted is a trained Moslem doctor with a gift for organization, and an adequate staff to work in conjunction wfith the Adviser; otherwise there is grave risk of an epidemic when the pilgrims begin to arrive. Presumably the International Quarantine Board will now resume its work at Jeddah. The Police Force, as a force, does not exist; when the importance of safeguarding the pilgrims en route to Mecca and Medina is alluded to, the invariable reply is°that the Arabs will not dare to disobey the Sherif. Their attitude at Babigh and the fact that they have had three years forced abstinence from raiding makes one sceptical as to their obedience. The Arabs leave too much to Allah and must be saved from themselves, since a disastrous pilgrimage would not only be fatal to the Sherif’s prestige but would affect the lives of British subjects and harm us in our Mohammedan possessions. Adequate medical precautions, safe passage in the interior, and cheap food are the three most essential desiderata to the pilgrims and should be urgently attended to. I should have liked to have talked to inherit Mohsm about the pilgrimage but he was, unfortunately, top ill. Public security has been well maintained in Jeddah, the only house to be looted being that of Sheikh Ahmed Hegazi, the Jeddah Agent of Sherif Haidar Ali. The presence of a British warship off Jeddah has probably had a restraining influence on the Arabs. Cairo, July 8, 1916. K. CORNWALLIS, Captain, APPENDIX I. The fodowing is a summary of the Sheriffs requirements :— I.—Military. (a.) For Immediate Action. 1. 7,000 rifles, of which 1,000 are very urgently required at Rabigh. 2. 5,300,000 rounds of S.A.A., of which 1,000,000 are very urgently required at Rabigh. 3. 50 kilog. of dynamite. 4. 500 hand bombs. 5. Five Trained Moslem Armourers for the repairs of both rifles and guns. 6. Two or three Moslem experts in explosives, about whom Colonel Wilson has already telegraphed to the Sirdar. 7. 250 tents at Rabigh.9. 10 . Monthly requirements to start from the 1st July. 50.000 okes of flour 70.000 okes of rice 2,000 okes of coffee 2,000 okes of sugar (Three-fourths to be landed at Ttabigh and one-fourth at Jeddah.) The detailing of two ships permanently to carry the above. Three-fourths of the supplies still due to be landed at Rabigh and one-fourth at Jeddah. (b.) For Immediate Consideration. 1. The formation and equipment of a force of approximately 30^,000 Hejaz Arabs. 2. Collection, equipment, and preliminary training of all Arab sympathisers in British prisoners-of-war camps. These to he subsequently sent to the Hejaz to form the nucleus of the Arab Army. 3. Possibly the maintenance of this army in the field, both in supplies and munitions. 4. The two extra mountain batteries, one howitzer battery, one field ambulance. and two or four aeroplanes, already asked for by Sherif, are included in the above scheme. If.—P olitical and Miscellaneous. 1. Official recognition by the Powers. 2. Official recognition by the Moslem world. (To be arranged by the Arabs themselves.) 3. A monthly grant of .125,000L, to be paid in gold from the 1st July, 1916. (This is required for the organisation and maintenance of Government.) 4. The dispatch of the Mahmal at the usual time. 5. The raising of the Blockade as far south as Lith and the free entry to the Hejaz of all articles. (This involves cancelling the order now in force, which only sanctions the import of necessities.) 6. A Sea-going Yacht with a Moslem crew. (I do not think that the Sherif expects to get this. At all events, Faroki regards it as impossible.) III.— Recommend ations. 1 Immediate appointment of a British officer to act as liaison officer, or, if a thoroughly experienced and Anglophile Mohammedan cannot be tound, as Advisei*, under some unpretentious title, to the Hejazi Governor of Jeddah. He will need a junior British officer, an Egyptian officer from the Sudan Civil Service, and some clerks. 2 Immediate appointment of an official with Consular experience, but without the title of Consul. He would work under the English Adviser, if appointed. _ _ . . 3. Appointment of two small committees, one civil and one military, composed of English and Arab members, if the Arab pioposals are approved m then entirety. _ ait 4. Arranging for the cargo of the steamship “ Firuza,” now at Aden, to be forwarded to Jeddah. _ 5. Immediate dispatch of an experienced doctor, with an adequate staff, to Jeddah.My ^PRESENT to your honour my best salaams, and I heartily thank you for your kindness and good hospitality. ^ ^ Sir, I am intoxicated with my good luck which created the opportuniuy for me to be honoured by being in the presence of my Grand Master, whom I found ^eiy well and very capable to administrate all the Arabs’ and Muslems affairs. He is more than fit to be their Grand Kaliph, Governor, and Director of their policy. All my dreams and desires can really be attained through him. He is very well informed of all the needs and the necessities, consequently I am quite pleased and lejoiced, and in the meantime I am powerless to describe him, may God protect him for the Muslems in general and for the Arabs in particular. 1 have drunk the cup of happiness for being able to hit the mean Turks actually. You know, Sir, that I had worked for several years to humiliate the Turks politically and to have all happiness for the Arabs. Praise be to God who granted me the means and enabled me to fight against the Turks and smash them. Taking the Turks’ guns in Jeddah we brought them to Mecca—the Pdessed- and to-day we have fired at the barracks which is the only shelter for the Turks. We fired at it strongly by our Lord’s command (Sherif’s). Sir, each gun I fired had echoed in my heart with pleasure and gladness. Neither the champ igne, which the honourable Mr. E. Storrs promised to drink with me after the Turks had been defeated, nor any other thing in the world would please me more than hitting the Turks and destroying their barracks and killing their soldiers by their own guns. No better life than it is now. It is six days now that I have only few hours sleep and this does not affect me nor the weariness. I thank God who guided me to such doing which none of my brethren whom you know and who are my partners, in such a luck. I I The Political State concerning Great Britain in Turkey. The Arabic and Turkish newspapers issued in Syria and Constantinople publish many an article against Great Britain. They state that Great Britrin is a cheating Power who always gives unfulfilled promises, and it is tyrannical; its policy is based upon ambition ; its mere desire is to annihilate the people, and stain the world with blood ; it is a bitter enemy to the Muslems and the Arabs, neither its words nor its treaties are to be d&lt; pended upon. . The Turks are preparing greater forces to attack Egypt. The papers state also that the. first attempt was only a test of the enemy’s power, but the next attempt will smash the English in Egypt, which will be the grave of the English, and that they will ask the Egyptians to create disturbances and call the help of the noble Arabs for such a conspicuous conquest. These papers are distributed gratuitously. I myself had seen their paper called “ El-Rai EL Am,” full of such statements and distributed freely. The Political State of the Arabs. The news which we received in Egypt concerning the hanging up, the deportation, and the imprisonment in Syria was true. They hung, lately, Sayed Abdul Bahim el-Zahrawi, who was a member of the Senate and president of the Arabian Congress held in Paris. Shafic Et-Moayad, Abdul Aziz El-Arces, and others were also murdered. They scratched the tomb of the late Amir Abdul Kadir el-Jazayri. The Syrian p ipers are puffing Jamal Pacha, a great deal as they used to do for JTertx-Abdul Hamid, and it seemed that they were compelled to do so with the exception of “ El-Alam El-Islami,” edited by Abdul Aziz Shawish in Constantinople, and “El-Shark” (the Orient), edited by Shakeil Arislam, in Syria. The above-named papers may praise the Turks and their Sultans and the courage of the troops. They abuse the English, and slam [sic] their honour because of the Dardanelles and Cout Elemara. They are exerting their zeal to stir tiie Arabs and the Egyptians against the English. They abuse also the people who are working for uplifting the Arabs. The editor of “ El-Sl lark ” expressed his joy on the day of El-Zahrawi’s murder.The Political State in Hejaz. All the people of Hejaz bear obedience to our Lord, and all are devoted to his cause, as I told you before, and they are ready to give up their lives in his path, and none would object to carry out his commands. Such a spirit is possessed by the people in Yemen and Neja. All speak of the independence of the Arabs under the suzerainty of our Grand Lord whom they call “ Our Lord ” and the “ Lord of All.” All the Arabs are glad to learn of our Lord being an Ally to Great Britain, to have in all their affairs. When they find themselves lacking something, they say : “ Our true friends the English will send it to us.” They also say : “ If the Turks would attack the Suez Canal before he attack them (Turks) in Syria, and drive them out of it, we will take the side of the English and fight against the Turks. They really hate the Turks. The Turks who refuse to surrender to the Arabs, they call them infidels (Kafirs). In short, if the Allies will use a better policy in dealing with the Arabs, they will find the Arabs quite useful to them, and specially for the English, more than they got from their Ally—Italy. The War State in Hejaz. All the Arabs are fighting men, together with their children and septuagenarians. It is very easy for Our Grand Lord to levy from 160,000 to 250,000 fighting men from the Hejaz alone, with the exception of Yemen, Nejd, Enez tribes, &amp;c , and such fighting people are devoted to our Lord’s cause; they are courageous, intelligent, contented, and of good characteristics. They can bear all difficulties and hardships, and never taKe them into consideration. They lack constructors and trainers. If the Arab Officers would come and train them, I am sure they will make the best of soldiers upon earth for courage, contentedness, and devotion to their ruler whom they love intensely, and also for ability to stand hunger and thirst, and trust one another. I thought in such time there would be much looting and robbery, but, to my astonishment, nothing happened of this sort, and security is established everywhere m all Hejaz. _ , Our Grand Lord has used in this blessed rise about 15,000 men only, to fight against the Turks in Hejaz. The number ot Turks here is as I told you before. The Turks beseiged in Medina are under command of Fakhir Pasha, whom I was the Aide-de-camp of, and was the Commander of the 12th Division. Jeddah has surrendered, and plenty of ammunition, guns, and machine-guns were c .ptured. Taif is beseiged. Arabs won many a battle af Medina and Taif, and news comes daily from there. Mecca Barracks is besieged strongly, and its quick surrender is expected daily. ... The Arabs who were among the Turkish troops shall join in our Lords service with the Arabs. _ . I took six soldiers of the captured battery in Jeddah for firing at Mecca Barracks, after explaining to them how the Turks were and are oppressors. “ Just see that great difference ” ; they were firing at us before long, and now they are firing at the Turks. They are quite happy, and pleased to fire at them. The Turkish forces in Syria number 35,000 to 40,000. The things which we talked about long ago, concerning the organisation of the Government and the Army, met our Lord’s approval, and he knows ^ everything He told me to do what is necessary. Consequently, I shall come to Cairo, to settle all about the things required when my Lord gives me permission. Accept my salaams. , _ Mohamed Shenf, EL-FABUKI. APPENDIX III. A Separate Slip from the Sherif of Mecca. I CONSIDER that it is necessary for us to appoint an agent who can represent me in intercourse with the British Government, and I should like him to be in Cairo&gt; as it is the nearest place.( 22 ) I recommend Sherif El-Faruki as my representative, and should be glad to have your opinion as to his suitability for this position. [Unsigned.] To the Eminent Vizier, the High Commissioner in Egypt. With the help of God, the rising of the peoples of all our countries has obtained our independence through their success and victory, with the exceptions of garrisons of a fort and barracks at Mecca, and only a garrison (of a fort) at Taif. In order to save bloodshed we are leaving them to fall by themselves, as they are completely surrounded. Consequently, and owing to the existing relations between the Islamic world and the British Government, we beg you to raise the blockade for the whole Hedjaz coast, and to protect all dhows dying our flag, which is a plain dark red with the Arab, until we inform the other Powers of our flag, which will shortly be hoisted by the help of God. (Signed) Sherif, Emir of Mecca, HUSSEIN. 23rd Shaaban, 1334. To His Excellency the High Commissioner in Egypt. In the Name of God the Most Merciful, the Compassionate! “ 0 God, grant us guidance in our cause ! ” To the Honourable and Eminent Grand Vizier, the High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Arthur MacMahon, the Bespectable. With the providence'of God, the blessed and the exalted, this country was able to rise against the Turkish Government. I am sure you have heard of the entire fall of Jeddah and the capture of its forces and civilians, and also of the fall of Mecca, with the exception of a garrison of a fort upon a hill and a barracks outside of it, which are still holding out uselessly. It is beseiged absolutely. God willing, I shall before lone send my official reports to His Britannic Majesty the King and to other Kings and Emirs of the Muslems whom we think it necessary to send to. But to save time 1 hasten to inform your honour of the following :— Firstly. Inform whomsoever it may concern to bring us from the beginning of next month the 125,000b, the monthly sum for the organisation of the civil and military (services) and all the affairs of the country, as was previously decided. Secondly. As the war is going on between my sons (who are camping around Medina) and the Turkish army, and as they are in need of supplies and war materials, of which there is a sufficient quantity for the moment stored at Port Sudan, please give orders that they should be sent to Rabigh, as soon as we ask for it, in a ship, and and the other lot, especially the two batteries, and one Abus, with all their necessary requirements, which will be, through your energy, of the latest pattern, ready with one mobile ambulance at Port Sudan, to .ask for when needed. Thirdly. All the supplies sent to us from Port Sudan were in very small sacks, the two of which are equal to one ordinary sack. Accept my great respect. (Signed) The Sherif and Emir of Mecca, HUSSEIN. Dated Shaaban, 1334. APPENDIX IV. The Sherif s Proclamation (Translation). [This was reproduced in extenso in the Appendix to Arabian Beport No. II N.S.] r Vfl ■e, ( 23 ) APPENDIX Y. His Excellency the High Commissioner (usual title and compliments). ^ I MUSi tliank you in this letter also for facilitating matters by sending Faroki to me. We send him back to talk over important matters concerning the declaration of the reality of our lawful rising and the reasons which compelled us to rise, in order that we may have the support in every case of the lovers of truth and the like. Secondly (to discuss) what is connected with the formation of an army to face whatever may befall the country—such as the despatch of the Arab officers available and their preparations, and also to state all our requirements as regards arms—their kinds and amounts, &amp;c. No doubt the realization of these important and far-reaching results will depend upon the facilities given to him by your Excellency. I express my greatest respect and honour to your Excellency.

Dear Sir, June 30, 1916. MY august master has instructed me to forward the attached telegram to his Excellency the High Commissioner in order that- he may pass it as soon as possible to the President of the United States. I, therefore, request that you will kindly send it to the High Commissioner, begging him to do so. Kindly acknowledge the receipt of this and accept my best respects. (Signed) Mohamed Sherif EL-FAPOKI. Translation of Telegram. To His Excellency the Honourable the President of the United States. We beg your Excellency to inform Enver Pacha, Talaat Bey, and Jemal Pacha that according as they treat our brother, Sherif Nasir Ibn Ali, or any of his household who are now in Constantinople, so will we treat the civilian and military prisoners now in our hands in the Hejaz, Asir, and Yemen, and that if any harm befalls any of them, the like will befall the prisoners. In conclusion, we present to your honoured person our warmest compliments. (Signed) Sherif and Emir of Mecca the Blessed, HUSSEIN ALI. June 30, 1916. APPENDIX VII (a). From Mecca the Blessed to Cairo the Protected. His Excellency the Eminent Vizier and High Commissioner in Egypt. WITH the fingers of esteem and respect I received the letter of the Grand Vizier dated the loth Shabaan 1334, which contained the congratulations and-compliments on what God has granted us in freeing the country from the oppression and evil of the enemy. In very truth, God has brought it about that our endeavours are successful, and there remians only a garrison in a high fort in the Holy Town of Mecca, Jiyad by name, and its garrison is not now more than fifty persons, but the barracks ouside the town are strongly fortified, having a garrison of more than 800. The Vali and his [898—1] Hpan j : ‘ : n ( 24 ) people, both Civil and Military, took refuge in the fort of Taif. In Mecca we have contented outselves with little fighting in order to save bloodshed, being well assured of the ultimate result of the siege. The garrison is cut off from water. In Taif in the last battle my son, Abdulla, who commands the force there, captured a gun with a number of men, and he has surrounded the fort on all sides. We are awaiting the two guns which you have sent with your energy and which will be sent to him to-morrow from here, and no doubt on their arrival God will grant him the fall of the fort. We consider that nothing is so important now as the operation of the troops of the enemy and other forces on the Northern Frontier ; consequently, we have sent a Maxim battery, and the remainder of the other battery via Rabigh to strengthen the troops of my other sons who are camping there. We hope that on the first opportunity after the fall of the above-mentioned forts we will reinforce them with the extra forces now scattered all over the country. Though the help of God all the country is being managed without any opposition and is completely quiet and contented. In conclusion, I beg you to accept my best regards. (Signed) Sherif and Amir of Mecca, the Blessed, HUSSEIN. 30 Shabaan, 1334. r APPENDIX VII (b). The Honourable His Excellency the High Commissioner in Egypt. His Excellency the Eminent Vizier, WITH all sorrow and regret I received your noble letter, issued in Cairo on the 18th Shabaan, 1334, which brought the news of the death of the distinguished soldier Lord Kitchener. The existence of those who will fill his position and act his part amongst the sons of Great Britain and the subjects of His Majesty will make us forget our grief and our lost hopes. Indeed ages are fixed, and I beg to express my consola tion to His Majesty the King on account of his bereavement. Only the existence of His Majesty will remove the mourning of Great Britain for his death.' May God grant us His mercy and benevolence ! With my best salaams to your Excellency. (Signed) Sherif and Emir of Mecca the Blessed, 30 Shabaan 1334. HUSSEIN. APPENDIX VII (c). The Honourable and Most Respectable Captain Cornwallis. WE have learnt from the letter of his Excellency the High Commissioner, Sir Henry MacMahon, dated the 15th Shabaan, 1334, that your Honour has been appointed his representative at Jeddah, in order to expedite all our demands and needs. Faroki Bey also informed us of the same yesterday, as you know, and no further explanation is needed. To fulfil our promise, we have instructed Faroki Bey to inform you that our monthly requirements are in accordance with the list appended, which we wrote m order to confirm what we had told him. We also wish to bring to your notice the fact that we had previously asked his Excellency for 20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 150 sacks of coffee, 150 sacks ol sugar, 1,000 sacks of barley, and 5,000 rifles, with ammunition and various kinds of cartridges, and that all the above should be ready at Port Sudan. The reply of his Excellency showed that they were in readiness. We asked for a consignment of 1 500 ri j sac ^ s fl° ur &gt; 50 sacks of rice, and 30 sacks of coffee, to be sent to Rabigh; aim this was done, with 500 sacks of dura and 500 sacks of dukha. Since then several i erent consignments have been sent of which we have no details, except in the case o ne rifles, a certain number of which our son Zaid asked you to send to .Rabigh when( 25 ) y°u met him El Badia. He also asked for 4,000 sacks of what was stored to be sent o a L g, , m ^ rom recent correspondence I do not think that this was done. In conclusion, accept my best regards. (feigned) The Sherif and Emir of Mecca the Blessed, on 07 7. HUSSEIN 30 Shabaan 1334. -Ihe different consignments were not sent at our request. APPENDIX VII (d). (Enclosure.) You informed us yesterday that the following are at Port Sudan, and that some more will come in a week’s time;— At Port Sudan : 1,224 sacks of flour ; 2,303 sacks of rice. Balance to come: 9,991 sacks of flour = total, 11,215; 8,332 sacks of rice— total, 10,635. To-day we have instructed Faroki Bey to inform you that the monthly amount •which we require in order that three months’ supplies may be provided. This is 50,000 okes of flour, 70,000 okes rice, 2,000 okes coffee, and 2,000 okes of sugar.

The following- is the announcement which has been promulgated among- the Moslem communities m the British colonies :— 6 “ For many years the Arabs, chafing under the misrule of Turkey, have looked orward to the day when they could regain their former freedom, and revolts against lurkisn domination m Arabia have been frequent in the past.

(New Series.) ! S‘- iI9L&gt; NO reference is made in the report to the action at Katia as it is a military operation^and the report is confined strictly to political information ; hut nevertheless it is the^ principal political event of the week in the region affected by the Arab movement. At present it is difficult to gauge its general influence on the situation as it is not yet clear what the total result of the action amounts to. The Turks will lay stress on the fact that the action was offensive, and fought on enemy soil; should, however, the fighting result in the destruction of their expedition, movement in Syria may fie expected. ,p:The agent’s reports of Syria, which correspond very closely with M. Eddeh’s account as given in the interview at Paris, show that Syria is in a state of almost complete political disorganisation, and that it will not require much to bring about the deliverance of the country from Turkish rule, provided always that the Turks have not at their disposal an additional organised military force which they can withdraw from other fields of operation. Though no precise proofs can be shown, it is suggested that there are signs of a “rapprochement” between and an access of strength to the various parties opposed to the Committee of Union and Progress. The tone of the Sheriffs mani festo, various rumours of mutiny among Turkish troops, and the attitude of the Syrians, all go to show that either a Turkish disaster of a magnitude that cannot be concealed or a further shaking of the prestige of the Central Powers may very probably result in a political upheaval in Turkey, with the object of destroying the Germanophil group. In such an event the Committee of Union and Progress may he expected to survive by diving under the surface, sacrificing one or two of its most notable puppets, and taking charge of the rebellion against itself. The friction between Idris and the Sherif is typical of the difficulties of working with a race of people in a pre-nationalist state of political existence. These difficulties are not minimised by the fact that the Indian Government pays, arms, supports, and influences one local magnate while the Egyptian Government does the like for the other. A divided people is difficult to unite with a divided authority in control. However, it is to be hoped and expected that our officers on the spot will surmount the difficulties which our system and Arab racial peculiarities have laid in their path. As far as can be seen neither party has much claim to Comfida, and matters are complicated by ancient animosities and feuds. However, it must always be remembered that the di ei ence between a state of war or peace existing between Arabian chiefs is not so great as might be supposed. There is often as much fighting between two sides who are at peace but on bad terms as between two parties at war but not violently Hostile to each other. In judging the Sherif of Mecca and Idris in these matters account has also to be taken of two factors :— (a.) That the chiefs are obliged to placate their followers^ and relatives by marriage, the latter multiplied by frequent and prolific nuptials. (b.) That chiefs are not in close telegraphic control of their lesser expeditions. [898—21 /A*'''The French Government’s proposal of sending a deputation to the Sherif would he best dealt with by making the deputation a matter solely concerned with the pilgrimage. There is no news of any consequence from other parts of Arabia. It is to be noticed that we are still without any official information in regard to Koweyt, Bahrein, the Trucial coast, or Maskat. The^ publication of the Sherifs proclamation is held up in Mesopotamia for reasons which are not quite clear. The G.O.C. at Singapore gives an encouraging account of the feeling among the Moslems towards the Arab movement. The evident interest taken by the Government authorities in the matter perhaps explains this. As regards the press there are several points which deserve attentiofi. Mr. Lovat Fraser’s letter should be read. He is a leading journalist in oriental maffbrs who has forgone many opportunities of writing articles of a remunerative kind in deference to the policy advocated by the Press Bureau, and is naturally somewhat amlbyed that | others should profit by his silence. The Indian press extracts sent by the Indian Government to the India Office’ are too numerous to attach to this report, but it is recommended that either they^ be printed and circulated by the India Office or attached to the next number of the Arabian Keport. They are interesting as showing (a) the extraordinary confusion of thought obtaining in the Indian Moslem mind in regard to the Caliphate, (6) that the telegrams from the Government of India during the early stages of the Arab movement give a stronger impression of hostility than do the articles themselves. Mr. Kidwai’s letter to the “Nation” appears to advocate by implication the assassination of the Sherif of Mecca. His knowledge of early Moslem history appears to be somewhat hazy. Mr. Kidwai is evidently either the anonymous Moslem, resident in London, whose address, which was printed in Arabian Report 22 a, was separately circulated by the India Office, or a collaborator. It is suggested that the issue of the “Nation” containing Mr. Kidwai’s letter should be suppressed in India and Egypt. The article referred to by Mr. Fraser appeared in the current “ Contemporary Review.” It is a very moderate and useful account of the Caliphate, well worth reading. Its author does not seem to trespass beyond the “Encyclopaedia Britannica” (last edition) in search of information, but the account is readable and brief. The two extracts from the “ Idea Nazionale ” are indications of the line which a certain school of Italian politicians may be inclined to follow, to the general un-ease of the Middle East. M. S. P.S.—The news of the Turkish reoccupation of Bitlis and Mush and General Baratoff’s retirement only arrived after the report w 7 as compiled and the appreciation written. From a political point of view the news is regrettable, as it suggests that the Russians will be out of touch with the area affected by the Arab movement for some time to come, and that the Turks may be able to increase their anti-Entente and anti-Arab propaganda in the direction of Afghanistan. Further, if the present Russian line is the one to be held during the snow-bound months October 1916 to March 1917, the Turks will have some leisure to attend to Syrian troubles. M.

THE SHEEIF OF MECCA. The Sherifs Operations. ON the 4th August Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 664] that the Sherif had informed Colonel Wilson that the Turkish troops in Medina were mostly from Aleppo, that 10 per cent, of them had deserted, and that the Turks were sending others back to Syria. The Sherif had also stated that the arms sent by us had improved the condition of the Arabs at Medina. He asked for a man-of-war with aeroplanes to be stationed off Yambo. The French Government and the Sherif. The French Charge d’Affaires has informed the Foreign Office that his Government proposes to send a mission to the Sherif, composed of notables and Moslem officers from Algeria, Tunis, and Morocco. They would carry presents and congratulations to the Sherif, and would arrive before the end of the Haj. It also proposes to organise a restricted pilgrimage in those countries. The Sherif and the Official Announcement. In regard to the announcement promulgated among Moslem communities in British dominions [ £C Arabian Beport,” N.S. Ill, p. 26], Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on the 5th August [No. 671] that he had. received a telegram from the Sherif’begging him to convey his heartfelt thanks to His Majesty the King, to whom he was also telegraphing direct. The Sherif and Idrisi of Asir. On the 31st July Sir H. McMahon reported [No. 643] that he had received a telegram from the S.N.O., Port Sudan, stating, that: (l) by order of the Sherif, Said Mohammed Nazir, of Lith, was advancing on Comfida, (2) the G.O.C., Egypt, had requested the S.N.O. to inform Nazir that the Turkish garrison at Comfida had been [898—2] B2 i! » : I captured and Idrisi’s flag hoisted by the British, with whom and the Sherif he was co-operating, and that therefore Nazir must withdraw ; and (3) the S.N.O. had commu nicated by telephone with the Sherif, and had told him that H.M. ship at Comfida would support Idrisi if attacked, but the Sherif refused to countermand his order. Sir H. McMahon instructed Colonel Wilson to impress on the Sherif the folly of ^ making an enemy in his rear, and, should he prove obdurate, to tell him that a collision s with Idrisi would be regarded with great displeasure. On the 3rd August the Besident at Aden telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon [No 232 A.P.] that if Idrisi’s claim to Comfida was the real cause of difference, he should recommend its withdrawal, as it was not well founded. .On the same day Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 655] that the Sherif and Colonel Wilson had been in communication. The Sherifs story was that thirteen prominent Shaykhs of Comfida and its neighbourhood, having received his proclamation, wrote to him acknowledging him as their over-lord, and hinting that Idrisi was disloyal. He thereupon sent Nazir to Comflda with thirty men, his orders being to consult Idrisi’s representative and the local Arabs who had threatened to attack towns; he was to report and to prevent friction if possible. The Sherif said that it would be a breach of faith for him to hand over to Idrisi tribes with whom he himself had made definite agreements. Colonel Wilson unsuccessfully tried to persuade him to recall Nazir. The Sherif declared that he could not submit to arbitration, for the possession of Comfida was at present vital to his interests, though he was willing to surrender it at the end of the war. Colonel Wilson urged the importance of showing a united front to Turkey, but the Sherif was firm. He accused us of a breach of faith in bringing Idrisi’s forces north without his consent, and then issued a virtual ultimatum that we must choose between him and Idrisi. Colonel Wilson thinks that this need not be taken too seriously, and that the Sherif will not break off relations; but a rupture would compromise the situation. Sir H. McMahon agreed that a rupture should be prevented at all costs, and sent instructions to the S.N.O. in the Red Sea not to intervene. In his opinion Idrisi’s troops should be withdrawal ; the tribes round Comfida have always been opposed to him.. On the 4th August the Resident at Aden telegraphed [No. 234 A.P.] to the commander of H.M.S. “Fox” that, in view of the importance of making the Sherif concentrate his efforts against the Turks, it was essential that Idrisi’s troops should be withdrawn at once; and he asked Commander Boyle to urge “on so good a friend ” the necessity of his acquiescing in the withdrawal of his garrison, leaving his claim to be settled after the war. Commander Boyle replied on the same day [No. 235 A.P.] that Suva from Comfida reported that Nazir had retired, and that the inhabitants expressed loyalty to Idrisi. The Resident asked to be informed as to the High Commissioner’s washes. On the 5th August Sir H. McMahon instructed the Resident that the withdrawal of Idrisi’s garrison was still desirable, and suggested a consultation at Jeddah between Colonel Wilson and Commander Boyle. He himself was informing the Sherif that Comfida should be left unoccupied by either side until a settlement was reached.' :i: ' On the 6th August Colonel Wilson telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon that Commander Boyle of H.M.S. “Fox” was with him and that they were working together; time being of importance they considered that they should be left to do as best they could, on the principle that Idrisi’s garrison should leave. They both considered that the only possible solution was for the Sherif to have Comfida nowq leaving the final decision to be made after the war. The High Commissioner informed the Foreign Office [No. 675] that, in view of the urgency of the situation, he had given Colonel Wilson and Commander Boyle a free hand, and had informed Aden. 'V ■ The Raj. In a telegram to Sir H. McMahon on the 3rd August [No. 651] Viscount Grey said that the Indian Government had expressed the opinion that the most natural and effective propaganda agency in India would be pilgrims returning without grievances; he therefore suggested that the Sherif should be so advised, and that, if necessary, he should be subsidised to enable him to lighten the cost of the pilgrimage. * The facts mentioned in this and the preceding two paragraphs are taken from three despatches of Sir H. McMahon, all dated August 5 [Nos. 666, 667, and 668].Tl-i' 2.1 \ h Sir H. McMahon had already intimated to the Sherif on the 25th July that His Majesty’s Government trusted that, in consideration of the large grant which had been made to him, he would make “most satisfactory arrangements for the pilgrimage, which His Majesty’s Government considered to be of paramount importance. ^ The Viceroy telegraphed on the 31st July [P, 3043] that he was issuing a com- ununique, in regard to the Haj, that it would only be possible to arrange for a reduced traffic. Visit of Indian Officers to the Sherif. On the 2nd August the D.M.J. telegraphed to D.M.I., Cairo, informing him that the suggestions made by ftisaldar Major Gul Mawaz Khan [see “ Arabian Report, N.S., II, p. 2] had been rejected by the Indian Government \jihid., N.S., III, p. 3j, but that the India Office had no objection to two or three such officers going to the Sherif for Intelligence purposes if the War Office should apply for them. H.M.L proposed sending them if D M. I. Cairo concurred, which the latter did by telegram on the same day [I.G. 1048]. ftisaldar Major Gul Mawaz Khan and Mir Alum Khan, with two orderlies, left London on the 5th August and were to embark at Marseilles on the 9th, full instructions having been sent to General Clayton. Mr. Chamberlain informed the Viceroy by telegram on the 6th August [P. 3093]. Arab Prisoners in Pgy'pt. On the 3rd August, Sir H. McMahon telegraphed [No. 656] that 125 gunners with five officers had been sent to the Sherif with guns and ammunition. Of these three officers and 112 men had been taken from prisoners of war sent from India. I his he said must be regarded as an experiment. He said, too, that the M ar Office had asked for six Arab gunners for Idrisi; he considered the sending of these to be very undesirable, and added that Arab prisoners who were willing to serve the Sherif were unwilling to serve other Arab chiefs. , n t n q rx a oovrl On the preceding day the G.O.C. Egypt had telegraphed to O.I.G.S [LA. 2W6] that the Arab Bureau strongly advised that men should not be sent to Idrisi ; so that the officers at Suez who had agreed to go to the Sherif had required much persuasion to induce them to give their consent, whilst the men had agreed to serve under their own officers in some place unknown. Though not directly concerned m his opinion, great risk would be run unless the men were fully conscious of what they ; were doing and their officers really anxious to go. The Sherif and the Moslems of the Far Fast. The G O.C. Singapore reported on the 7th August [O.N. 58] that the Arab feeling in that nlace m regard to the Sherif and his move was satisfactory, and that the sympathies of other Mohammedans were gradually inclining to the Sherd ; that the news of the execution of Arabs by the Turks had caused profound indignation among the Arabs who were also much 'exercised by the resignation of the Sheik-ul-Islam Ham Effendi • that Syed Omer Alsagoff, a merchant prince of hingapoie had te.egiaphed Us congratulatioL and good wishes to the Sherif, Jeddl ItThe dtposal (Syed) had also offered to place his extensive house property at Jeddah at the d^ of the British Government— an offer which the G.O.C. had passed on to the Governor district magistrates in the Federated States had reported as follows (1 in Selangor the Malays were generally indifferent, except that now they i Udglt intokh with relations andfriends in \ Lk T VtLbld fan's S 3 ) In (2.)

MUSKAT. [Nil.]KOWEYT AND THE TRUCIAL COAST. [Nil.] ■ C ♦ PABT II. POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. Aden. G.O.C. telegraphed to C.I.G.S. on the 1st August [6630 G.I.] that an agent returned from Hajariya had reported all quiet; and on the 2nd [6640 G.L] that an agent who left Kataba on the 17th July reported all quiet and that the Imam’s troops were tax-collecting in the vicinity of Damt. The latter agent reported a story current at Dala that the Sherif had sold Jeddah to the British and that he had also sold his religion. On the 3rd August he telegraphed to C.I.G.S. [6650 G.I.] that the situation was unchanged ; also that there had been constant reports for the last fortnight of Turks sending ammunition to Subar and Fiyush. South Mesopotamia. On the 28th July the \iceroy telegraphed the concurrence of his Government in the objections of General Lake to Arab propaganda and the establishment of a newspaper. [See “ Arabian Report ” N.S. Ill, p. 4]. On the 4th August a telegram was sent to Sir H. McMahon [No. 653] stating that the G.O.C. in Mesopotamia thought that a proclamation from the Sherif might have effect if distiibuted. The present proclamation being considered unsuitable, the High Commissioner was asked to press the Sherif to issue another. On the 2nd August the India Office telegraphed to the Viceroy [P. 2957] that the Arab Bureau had been asked if a literary supplement to the u Hakikat ” could be produced in Egypt for insertion at Basra. G.O.C. reported on the 7th August that there was no change m the situation. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. 'Ihe Present Position in Syria.

Eddeh impressed me as a very sober- minded man, and not inclined to exaggerate. “ He stated that the situation of the Turkish Government was precarious in Syria, and that the Christians and Moslem Arabs had come too-ether in a most surprising wa J to misery and oppression. He remarked that there had never, even at the first outbreak of the Young Turk revolution in 1908 been such a rapprochement between the people of the two religions. There had been no actual outbreak of rebellion in Syria up to the time when he left, but the situation was only kept m hand by the Government striking hard at those leaders they5 cou!ftr I v y cli t ) h e e fi r . h T dS l-° n ’ ^ P i ying lai i g6 subsidies to those could not, viz., Sy“an Desert Tt, 1, ?10US ea 1 ers 0n , the 1 coas . t &gt; and the Shaykhs of the trarible esnecinll - e and wa,d he described as existing m all parts was very no nnn’ m P 7 m the L e ban °'&gt;; he estimated that of the Marionites, perhaps seizure °of 12^’ ^ had P erisbed ^ -tMcial famine prodLed ^ SyrianfhoneT^ 8 • he - Sh f rif ° f MeCCa ’ S rebellion . ^ was well received, and the „ h P. ed t0 .Pm in when opportunity offered, but were handicapped bv want of organisation and by the general confusion and poverty which existed.” “ I have, &amp;c. “ The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs “ MAEK SYKES - “ Foreign Office, S.W.” Syria.

G.O.a Basra telegraphed on the 6th August that the three Moroccans had been sent on to Bombay for transhipment to Egypt. Italian Enquiry as to Ottoman Territory. In a prevjous report [N.8. 1, p 8] the substance was given of a despatch in winch Lord Bertie reported that the Italian Ambassador had raised this question with the President of the Council. It had also been raised here, and Lord Bertie informed M. Briand that the Secretary of State thought that it would be difficult to exclude the Italian Government from the discussion of the subject, and asked for an expression of the views of the French Government^ On the 15th July M. Briand furnished a note on the subject, and Poped that the British Government would support him in the line he had taken vyith the Italian Ambassador—that when the proper moment arrived the questions relating to Asia Minor and Syria would be settled by the Powers in complete [898—2j { ,agreement one with the other. On the LiOth Jnly the Secretary of State dealt with this note in a despatch [ No. 495] to Lord Bertie, in which he urged that it was not worth while risking the alienation of Italian sympathy by refusing to make known to the Italian Government the agreements which had been arrived at, and by declining to define a claim to which Italy’s right was admitted. His Majesty’s Government,^- however, was prepared to support the French Government in rejecting the Italian claim^ to any part of Asia Minor beyond the Adalia region ; Italy was to receive vast compen sation in Europe for its participation in the war ; and in Asiatic Turkey it had neither the historic, nor the commercial, nor the political interests of the other Powers. The recognition of Italy’s claims in the Adalia region should encourage her to declare war on Germany, as that Power had designs for the exploitation of the district. A copy of the French note and of this despatch were sent to the Ambassador at Petrograd [No. 185] on the 27th July. Sir G. Buchanan being asked to explain to M. Sturmer that His Majesty’s Government thought that it would be impolitic for the three Powers to refuse compliance with the wishes of the Italian Government. PART IV. THE PBESS. Correspondence on the Caliphate in the “ Nation.” A correspondence has been going on in the Nation” during the last few weeks on the Sultan of Turkey and the Caliphate. A Mr. M. H. Kidwai, of Gadia, contributed a letter, dated from 158 Fleet Street, and published in the issue of the 29th July, in the course of which he said :— “ This is not the first time in Moslem history that a revolt against the established Khalifat has been made. Everybody knows that Hosain, the most beloved and saintly grandson of the Prophet himself, revolted against a wicked Khalifa named Yezid. For want of help and-sympathy from the general Moslem public, Hosain, with all the male members of his family, excepting one, was mercilessly butchered by the army of Yezid. Sunnis and Shiahs alike mourn his martyrdom every year in Moharrum, but neither did the Moslems of Hosain’s . days, nor do those of to-day, excepting Shiahs, give him any recognition of Khalifat. “ 1 he Sherif of Mecca, if he has revolted against the Khalifa, doubly deserves the same fate, and perhaps even worse than that of the Irish leaders who revolted against their Sovereign. Islam does not encourage rebellion and revolts.” Having read this letter Mr. Lovat Fraser, who is now on the editorial staff of the “ Times ” and was formerly for several years editor of the “ Times of India,” wrote as follows :— “ Dear Sir Mark, _ ^ _ The White House, Slough, July 29, 1916. “ In to-day’s ‘Nation’ you will find two letters discussing the question of the Khalifate, apparently in continuation of a correspondence which seems to have been going on all this month. One letter, signed ‘ M. H. Kidwai of Gadia,’ makes the agreeable suggestion that the Sherif of Mecca doublv deserves to be ‘ butchered ’ foy revolting against the Sultan. I dimly fancy that I have heard something suspicious about this man Kidwai, but cannot recall what it is. I should fancy from his letter that he is worth keeping an eye on. There seem to be a number of very queer Mahommedans knocking about this country. Sometimes they write to the ‘ Times,’ and I always advise the suppression of their letters. “I notice that the August ‘Contemporary Beview’ is to contain an anonymous article on ‘ the Sultan of Turkey and the Caliphate.’ “ My object in pressing these points on your attention is this.

The writer urged that it was necessary for Moslems that the Holy Cities should not be touched dmectly or indirectly by any Christian Power; and that it was necessary for Italy that a a ip late should not be founded under foreign influence, and so become aninstrument of antagonism to Italian expansion in the East. .

The same paper, in its issue of the 14th July, dealt with the Sherif s revolt. It said that its only information being non-official it could not state exactly-what had occurre but evidently, whatever it was, it was due to English action. It had already dealt the practical difficulty of creating an Arab Caliphate in place of the Turkish and w the nnmediate consequences which would flow therefrom m regard to the Moslem population of the Italian colonies. Events in Arabia should be carefully watched as the action of the rebels was of importance as affecting Eritrea. i 'A M - i &gt;SECRET. j- ''UV ^ • AiVv.-l APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED ARAB REPORT. No. ] (New Series). As the present Report rs cast in a somewhat different form to that hitherto adopted a cursory study of the paper as a whole is recommended, as it will give an indication of the system, which it is proposed to adhere to in future, and will make reference easier m forthcoming numbers. In the general situation there is little or no change since the issue of Report AaIIa, dated loth July. The mention of the fact that a post has been stopped between Medina and Syria suggests that some of the Northern Bedawin may have begun to 'co-operate with the The reception of the news in various parts of the Mohammedan world is generally satisfactory. The Indian situation, according to the latest telegrams, appears to be calming down after a certain amount of effervescence in pro-Turkish literary and journalistic circles. It is interesting to note that the Central National Mohammedan Association (composed chiefly of government officials) reserved its opinion on the situation, and that the Indian Ulema were rebuked by the Sadaqalz newspaper of Calcutta for not condemning the Sherif; since the Ulema were rebuked, it may be assumed that they^ also reserved their opinion; thus we have officials ’and regular ecclesiastics adopting a less hostile line to the movement than the ordinary representatives of political pro-Turkism in India. This, if Islam in India has any resemblance to Islam m other parts of the world, is a natural consequence. The Committee of Union and Progress devotes its attention to, and recruits its adepts from, the disaffected, discontented, and progressive unemployed of literary professions who hope that the overthrow of the existing system may enable them to obtain offices and emoluments which are under existing circumstances beyond their grasp • the more stable elements of a community are generally left alone or prove less susceptible to the propaganda of the Committee of Union and Progress which cannot hold out to them similar hopes of reward. In previous reports it has already been noticed that the leading Mohammedan rulers, such as the N izam, the Begum of Bhopal, and the Nawab of Tonk have not expressed the same irritation at the Sheriff action as those sections of the press which represent the views of the All India Moslem League and the Khudam-i-Ka’aba. The news from Kabul is still meagre, the condemnation of the Sherif’s action may be attributed to the steady stream of Teuto-Turkish propaganda which has been directed against Afghanistan since the beginning of the war. The Committee of Union and Progress methods in Afghanistan are different to those followed in India. In Afghanistan the appeal is to ignorance and fanaticism in distinction to the anneal to “ Intellect ” and “ Progress ” in India. PP S 316 30—7/1916The views of Major-General Powell are deserving of careful consideration since they give the point of view of one who has had long experience of the feelings of the native military classes in India. The two papers written respectively by Professor Margoliouth and Mr. Carruthers are of special interest since they expose the views of two persons who between them compass almost all that there is to be known about Arabs and Arabia; li©lessor Margoliouth is a scholar of European reputation, and Mr. Carruthers an explorer who ranks with the late Captain Shakespeare and Mr. Doughty. The attitude of the German agents in Tangier is worthy of notice, they are described as desirous of denying the fact of the Sherif s movement, this combined with the silence of the Germans and Turks on the subject of the Aiab movement m their communiques seems to indicate that at least they do not like the situation, and regard it with some annoyance if not alarm. The Italian enquiries in regard to the future status of Ottoman territories mark the appearance of a new T factor m the situation which will soonei or later lequne careful consideration. M. S. Committee of Imperial Defence, 19th July 1916. (9 a.m. ) P.S.—Information from an agent, dated 25th June, has been received, stating that rumour has it that the Ottoman Government will endeavour to settle matters with the Sherif by arbitration, and will not resort to strong measures until the attempt has failed. The existence of this rumour tends to confirm the idea that the Ottoman Government is uneasy about the situation. It is possible that the Sherif has sympathisers among the anti-Committee members of the Turkish Moslem clergy. Late news suggests that General Baratoff may retire still further to the North-East. This wdll reopen German and Turkish political communication with Afghanistan, a matter of somewhat serious moment in view of the situation at Kabul. M. S. 19th July 1916. (12 noon.)SECRET.

On i tli July tlie Slienf issued ti proclamation to the Moslem world m which after recalling Ids services to Turkey, he showed how the Committee of Union and Progress had oppressed Hejaz, had dishonoured Islam, had desecrated the grave of Abdul Kadir and had shelled the Kaaba, setting the Kiswah on fire and hitting the Black Stone and the sepulchre of Abraham. On account of these misdeeds he declared the independence of the country then controlled by the Committee of Union and Progress together with his intention to return to the strict law of Islam and to provide for the education of all classes. Attitude of the Indian Government. In regard to this proclamation, the Indian Government urged that, if it were open to revision, it should be amended by expunging the reference to the violation of the Hoi) Places by the Turks as Indian resentment against the Sherif was due to the accusation that his revolt had placed the Holy Places in jeopardy. This sugo- e stion has been endorsed by the Secretary of State for India, by Brigadier-General Clavton by the High Commissioner in Egypt, by the Commander-in-Chief in Egypt, and by the Arab Bureau. It was proposed that the substance of the proclamation after revision in this sense, should be published by Reuter ; in regard to this the Hio\h Commissioner expressed a hope that the Foreign Office would be consulted On 15th July, the High Commissioner informed the Foreign Office that he had repeated rhe advice he had already given to the Sherif, that is, that he should expunge from his proclamation all reference to the vdolation of the Holy Places. There is no information up to the present as to the advice having been taken or rejected Ihe rrench authorities in Morocco and Algiers have also asked for an omission’ I hey request that m the press communique giving the summary of the Sherif’s S 316 30—7/1916 A Turkey and Germany.

Sir H. McMahon has been informed of these representations. I.Gr.P. 2719. P. 2677. s Effect oil the Moslems in India and Afghanistan. The Viceroy reported on 10th July that the Indian Ulema had been violently attacked by the Sadaqat, a Calcutta newspaper, for not having openly condemned the Sherifalso that on the north-west frontier opinion generally was against the Sherif’s action. On Idth July he further reported that this had been condemned by meetings held at Bareilly and Moradabad (both in tlie United Provinces), but that in Calcutta a resolution had been passed by the ventral National Muhammadan Association (chiefly run by government officials) reserving its opinion and welcoming the assurance that ihe Hejaz would remain under independent Moslem rule and that Moslems would decide the question of the Caliphate. The Viceroy further stated that the press was still adverse to the Sherif, but, he added, Indian Moslems weie not likely to commit themselves seriously at present. Reference has already been made to another telegram of the same date in which the Viceroy attributed Indian resentment to the belief that the Sherif had jeopardised the Holy Places by his revolt. It must be noted at this point that there appears to be diversity of opinion as to the feeling in India, for the Arab Bureau in its report on current events reproduces a censored telegram stating that the Moslems of Calcutta were elated at the news from Hejaz, and that they felt assured that with British help the safety of the Holy Places would be secured. 1 his telegram was published by the Mokattam, a Cano newspaper. The Indian Government has been greatly perturbed by the Sherif’s action, and wishing to conceal the facts looked to the India Oflice for help. In reply to their representations the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 10th July. He pointed out that it was impossible to prevent the publication of Turkish communiques in neutral countries, and that the facts could not be indefiniteb concealed. All possible measures would be taken to conceal, as long as possible, the indirect connection of His Majesty’s Government with the revolt, but that he thought it could not be the wish of the Indian Government that Turkish falsehoods and bazaar rumours should be the sole source of information for Moslems in the East. So long as these considerations are borne in mind the Foreign Office was prepared to instruct Sir Charles Marling, the Minister at Tehran, to consult the Viceroy before publishing anything connected with the Arab revolt. Finally, he suggested that the Viceroy should instruct Sir Percy Cox and other officers to publish a plain statement that British ships have not fired upon the Moslem Holy Places, and that the Viceroy himself should similarly contradict falsehoods. As to Afghanistan, the Viceroy telegraphed on 13th July that the British Agent at Kabul reported that the revolt was condemned universally and ascribed to English intrigues ; but so far there had been no great excitement as the revolt in Hejaz was believed to have been promptly crushed. The latest communication from the Viceroy to hand is dated 15th July. In this he says that the Indian Government would prefer not to make any announcement in India at present for the reason that any official announcement would be liable to be distorted and misconstrued and would give food for fresh Pan-Islamic agitation ; that they had the Indian situation well in hand and _ thought it better for the Moslem community to get accustomed to the fait accompli in Hejaz than for it to be hustled into a definite attitude; that an announcement in Afghanistan of our sympathy for the Sherif (which would be construed as instigation and co-operation) would embarrass the Amir, who, until we declare ourselves, can answer the party in favour of the Turks by saying that he has no ground for quarrelling with us over this matter ; that reports from Kabul indicate that the Amir has called a secret council to discuss the matter and that there is excitement, which would be increased by the proposed announcement in India. As to the announcement itself, the Indian Government considered it to be unobjectionable and saw no reason why it should not be published in other Mohammedan possessions from which it could filter to India through the post. I&lt;} f Effect on other Parts of the Moslem World. It will be seen that the effect of the Sheriffs action in Morocco, Egypt, and the Sudan, on the Sunnis of Lower Mesopotamia, and, so far as can be judged from Jnformation to hand, on the Moslems of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been very different &gt;»om that in India and Afghanistan as repoited by the Viceroy. (1) Morocco. —In a despatch dated 29th June, Mr. Herbert White, His Majesty’s. Consul-General at Tangier, stated that no excitement had been caused in that part of Morocco ; that the report of the Sherif’s revolt had passed unnoticed by the majority of the people, and that among the educated there was uncertainty as to its truth, German agents having persistently spread about the statement that the report was devoid of foundation ; that the people of Morocco have no veneration for the Sultan of Turkey ; that the transfer of the guardianship of the Holy Places would be welcomed if it were accompanied by an assurance that there would be absolute immunity from non-Moslem control ; that most importance was attached to the reopening of the road to the Holy Places ; and that considerable enthusiasm would be aroused in Morocco if it were announced that pilgrims could proceed to Mecca. (2) Egypt. —The High Commissioner reported on 11th July that the general attitude in Egypt in regard to the Sherif remained tranquil. He also reported that, through an oversight of the censor, an allusion to the violation of the Kaaba had appeared in the newspaper El Ahram on 9th July, but as it lacked confirmation it had passed with little or no notice. The Arab Bureau has put together a number of extracts from the local press which are of value in estimating the situation :—The Mohaitam of 19th June published the first notice of trouble in the Hejaz It pointed out that the Arabs had given men, money, and time to the war and had for their reward been subjected to greater oppression and renewed attempts to “Ottomanize” their civilisation. The result being that in the Hejaz the Emirs have arrived at an understanding “ to strive with “ all their strength to change their present condition. They show us that they are “ the heirs of the old Arabian spirit, lighting the oppressors as did their forefathers. “ Idle Committee will now see the fruits of its tyranny.” The Arab Bureau says that this article “ with its half-veiled allusions to what the whole town was rumouring, “ was generally thought to be inspired and. created a considerable impression. It “ declared the direction in which much subsequent comment has run.” El Akhhar of 25th June says :—“Every Arab who still feels in him the blood of “ his ancestors, every Moslem on earth who knows how the Turk has scorned and “ exploited Islam, making its interests subservient to the needs of the policy of his “ own race, all who love justice and abhor iniquity will rejoice at the rebuilding of “ Arab independence by the hands of their great Sherif. We hope that the present “ indications that all Arab Emirs will throw in their lot with him and make his “ movement universal will be fulfilled.” ' , To these quotations may be added another from El Ahram which the Near East of 14th July reproduces from the Egyptian Gazette of 27th June. This is taken from an article written by Sheikh Hamid Ibrahim, who, after referring to the different views taken of the Sheriffs revolt, says :— “ Arguments cannot change the established fact that the people of Arabia have for a long time past longed to attain independence, and made various efforts to secure it, owing to the misrule and injustice of the Turks. Their attempts failed on previous occasions because every one of their Emirs thought himself fit for the leadership. Matters have uoav changed. The present movement has been started by an Emir whose superiority cannot be doubted, for he is the influential descendant of the Prophet and the inheritor of the wisdom, courage, and prudence of his worthy ancestors of the Koreish and Abd IVlunaf. All other chiefs must bow before the Grand Sherif of Mecca, and follow him in the realisation of the long-cherished hope of Arab independence and the revival of the old glory of fhe people .... Those among Moslems who have a sense of fair play wall see that the Sherif’s movement is only right. It cannot be disapproved, for all that the Moslems of the world desire in this 'respect is to have a safe path in the Hejaz to the Holy Shrines, and it is to be hoped that the pillage and robbery which prevailed in the Holy Land of Islam will henceforth cease to exist under the independent rule of the greatest Arab Emir.” (3) The Sudan. —The High Commissioner forwarded, on 13th July, a telegram from the Sirdar stating that so far as then known the Sudanese, of all classes, universally acclaimed the Sherif’s action as being an Arab and anti-Turkish movement No. 5^6. to restore the guardianship of the Holy Cities to the Arabs, their lawful and natural guardians, in a further telegram, received here on IIth July, the Sirdar says that the incident of the bombardment of the Holy Places had become known in the Sudan and had evoked yet greater bitterness against the Turks.4 (4) Lower Mesopotamia.- -The General in command at Basra reports, under date 9th July, that the small sprinkling of enlightened Sunni Arabs in that district were delighted at the news, and that among these was the chief Arab resident after the Naikib ; this man, who was made acquainted with Reuter’s communique by the Chief Political Officer, remarked spontaneously “ What the Sherif ought to do now is W declare himself Calif, everyone would welcome it.” Intelligent Shiah Arabs, to^ appear to be pleased with the news. On the other hand, an active pro-Turkish element, of which a number of former Turkish employees form the nucleus, regret it and consider it unfair of the Sherif to rebel whilst Turkey is in the throes of war. But, the General says, minds there are slow of movement, and it is yet early to gauge the full effects of the Sherif’s action ; the news has created no particular stir, many of the inhabitants are disinclined to credit the report, and the great majority are toe ill-informed 1o appreciate its significance. F. 0. tele- gram to Hio-h Com- rmssoner, Xo. 570, 12th July. No. 579. No. 587. (5) Bosnia-Herzegovina .—The Tribune de Geneve of 8th duly publishes a statement made by Moslems of this country who are students in the University of Geneva. They begin by unanimously acclaiming the action of the Sherif, “ head of Islam and sovereign master of the fatherland of Mahomet.” As faithful sons of Islam they fully approve the action of the Sherif and equally blame the actual regime in Turkey which had dishonoured their faith in placing it at the service of Germany and Austria. They regard as a great error the belief that the Sultans of Turkey were protectors of Islam, and point out that before the proclamation of the Jehad Islam had been in no way menaced, but that by that proclamation, made in favour of the German-Austrian alliance, of people who were the secular enemies of Islam, the. Moslem world [notre religion entiere] had been placed in jeopardy. Memorandum of Major-General Powell, C.B. Appended to this report will be found a “ memorandum on the rebellion of the- Grand Sherif of Mecca against the rule of the Young Turk,” with an appreciation thereof by Mr. D. S. Margoliouth, D.Litt. F.B.A., Laudian Professor of Arabic in the University of Oxford, and another by Mr. Douglas Carruthers. Payment to the Sherif. His Majesty’s Government has authorised the payment to the Sherif of 500,000/. in four monthly payments of 125,000/. each ; payment to be made by the Egyptian Government, which will be re-imbursed. Adviser to the Sherif. It appearing desirable that an English official should be near at hand to advise the Sherif, the High Commissioner proposed the appointment of Colonel Wilson. By telegram, dated loth July, the Foreign Office agreed to the appointment of such an official and suggested that it should be based on the need for supervision of the pilgrimage. It also pointed out that from the Indian point of view the sending of a soldier would proclaim our close relations with the Sherif. and that therefore the Government of India would probably prefer Dr. Richardson, the former Consul at Jeddah; His Majesty’s Government, however, would consent to the appointment of Colonel Wilson, unless the High Commissioner should be of opinion that Dr. Richardson would be equal to the duties required. But in any case it would only be a compara tively short time before our relations with the Sherif became publicly known. To this the High Commissioner replied on 15th July that the situation demanded an officer of military experience to discuss the Sherif’s requirements with him; and beyond this, a capable military adviser was much needed by the Sherif, but every care would be taken to keep the military character of “ Mr.” Wilson’s status and duties in the background. The appointment of Colonel Wilson was sanctioned by Foreign Office on 17th July, by telegram giving permission to apply to the Sirdar for his services. * 1^*1Cable from Suakin to Jeddah. 1 his has been repaired. The Jeddah oflice is worked by the Sherif’s operators, and the bhenf de^red that they should also work the office at Suakin. But the ^ JJjgh Commissioner was of opinion that we should keep that end of the cable entirely in 0111 hands, in which opinion the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed ms entire concurrence by telegram dated 13th July. The Sherifs Operations. On 10th July, 28 officers, 950 men, and 150 sick and wounded in the barracks at Mecca surrendered to the Sherif. On 7th July the position at Medina was causing the Sherif grave anxiety. The town was no longer invested, and one Turkish division was reported to be in the place. A telegram from the High Commissioner, dated 12th July, gives the information that a post captured on its way to Medina contained a despatch to Fahri Pasha, oideimg him to make a stand to tiie last possible moment and promising reinforcements. In a letter dated 6th July, Lieutenant-Commander Hogarth, R.N.Y.R., Director of the Arab Bureau, says that a short conversation with Captain Cornwallis, just returned from Jiddalg had given him the impression that affairs in Hejaz were not very promising. Destruction of the TIejaz Railway. On K ith July the Chief of the Imperial General Staff telegraphed to the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, suggesting that he should concert with the Sirdar with a view to seeing whether any assistance could he given to the Sherif in regard to the destruction of the railway, as the Sherif was probably ignorant of the art” of railway destruction. But on 14th July the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, replied that the Sherif was averse to destroying the railway, as it was built by Mahometans and was a Mahometan enterprise; he was, however, making arrangements to train Arabs in demolition work. Fhe Sherif appears to have changed his mind in regard to the railway, for the Senior Naval Officer in the Red Sea reports under date 24th June that the Arab leaders had reported having destroyed about 90 miles of railway north of Medina, and that on 20th June a message from the Sherif of Mecca asked for, among other things, charges for the demolition of the railway. On 22nd June another message reported that the Turks were repairing the railway destroyed by the Arabs. The Sherif and the Syrian Question. In this same letter Lieutenant-Commander Hogarth says that the Sherif has sent Faruki to Cairo to raise the Syrian question again ; and that, he says, “ will have to be emphatically turned down.” Djemal Pasha. It is rumoured that Djemal Pasha has been ordered to Arabia. Emir of Mecca appointed by Sultan of Turkey. An agent reports that Ali Haidar Bey was appointed Emir of Mecca by the Sultan, but dare not leave for Arabia. Turkish Troops for Arabia. Another agent reports that 5,000 troops have left Damascus and are now stationed at Mezerib for the purpose of invading Hejaz. Hejaz Officials. A telegram from Cairo, dated 17th July, announces that these have not been paid for the last five months.6 No. 7 Summary. LG. 3228. '! ! The.Idrissi o f A sir. On 30th June the Idrissi proposed his readiness to co-operate with the Sherif. He said that he had 30,000 Wetterli rifles, hut no ammunition. This information came from the Arab Bureau. On 3rd July it was reported that the Idrissi had accepted the Sherif’s suzerainty. On 9th July the Idrissi took Cumfida with eight officers and 50 men. On 12th July the Viceroy telegraphed that he agreed that the Idrissi should be trusted, and supported liberally with arms and ammunition. His alliance had been of some military and of very considerable political value, and, so far as his resources allowed, he had carried out his engagements. The Indian Government had warned him to avoid collision with other Arab Chiefs as far as possible. The Imam. Viceroy telegraphed, 12th July, that there was no likelihood at present of the Imam coming off the fence on our side. If, however, he showed an inclination to do so he should certainly be assured of full subsidies, equal to those which the Turks granted. No territorial promises should be made. Ibn Sand and Ibn Rashid. The General Commanding at Basra telegraphed, 9th July, that reconciliation with Ibn Rashid had been suggested to Ibn Sand by the Chief Political Officer. Nothing came of this, and eventually Ibn Rashid avowed that he was paid by the Turks, and would join them in attacking us if they sent troops to support him. The Arab Bureau reports that on 28th June Ibn Rashid came to a point within eight miles of Khamisieh on the Euphrates and there attacked Ibn Towala of 4he Aslam Shammar, who is friendly to us. A detachment of the 12th Cavalry went to the support of Ibn Towala. The forces of Ibn Rashid were defeated, and fled after losing half their strength. Sultan of Mushat. Nil Koireijt and Trucial Coast. Nil PART II. FIELDS OF OPERATION. (1) Mesopotamia. Nothing of importance except that Major-General Maude assumed command of 3rd Indian Army Corps on 12th July, and on 15th July General Gorrmge proceeded to India. But it may be well to insert here extracts from an important article on “ The Mesopotamian Campaign and its Objective,” published in the Near East of 14th July : — “ The proper co-ordination of the military efforts of the Allies in the Middle East calls for a very vigorous thrust on the part of the British Mesopotamian Expedition at this moment with a view to relieving the pressure on the Russians in Western Persia. Bagdad has been proclaimed far too emphatically as the British objective in this region to allow [the campaign go [came to an end before British troops enter the city. It would, therefore, be a grave mistake to regard the Mesopotamian Expedition now as merely a side-issue of the European War. Whatever it may have been in its origin, it has become, owing to the course which the operations have taken, an entirely distinct enterprise. On the battlefields of Europe the Allies are fighting for the cause of liberty and justice among the nations. In Mesopotamia—no good purpose can be served by attempting to hide the fact—the issues at stake are British prestige throughout the whole Arab world and the future peace of India. If the resistance of the Central Powers collapsed to-morrow and the Allies dictated peace a few days later in Berlin, the Middle East would remain largely unaffected in its estimate of British power, and would base its future attitude towards Great Britain on the facts of which it has been able to take note itself, namely, that the British were flung back from Ctesiphon by a Turco-Arab force, were compelled to capitulate at Kut, .. ^I and were unable to register a decisive success against tlie Turks. In these circumstances there can be no question of the Mesopotamian campaign being an unimportant appendage of the European war. It- can only be regarded as a separate war, albeit a small one, and it requires to be treated as such. In other words, thanks to the way in which the campaign has been handled, or mishandled, Great Britain cannot afford to rely upon the Allies’ ultimate success in Europe covering up failure in Mesopotamia, ^ait must see the expedition through to a victorious finish, if there is to be lasting peace in the East as ;ell as on the Continent. We are not concerned now with the antecedents of the campaign, or with the question whether it was necessary or advisable to advance beyond Kurnah in the first instance. The salient points are that a British force has matched itself against the Turks and their Arab levies in this region, and that it has been so far unsuccessful. Before the campaign can be allowed to come to an end failure must be wiped out, and this can only be done by the entry of British troops into Baghdad.” ^ 'k ,# # “In the face of all that has happened in Mesopotamia, including the despatch of an expedition ill-equipped and the absence of satisfactory measures for its reinforcement, there is a natural anxiety lest ignorance in high quarters should make the supreme blunder of all, and lay np a serious heritage of trouble for a time when the world is looking forward to an era of peace. No one asks that military secrets should be revealed, but it should be possible to allay the public anxiety lest Mesopotamia and the importance of its campaign should continue to be ignored. In many quarters the feeling is entertained that, if the steps that ought to have been taken to retrieve the mishaps of this expedition had been taken in time, General Lake’s force would have been in a position to render timely aid to our Allies, now beinu pressed back in Persia.” (2) Aden. General Stewart took over the cominand on lltli July. On 14ili July telegraph line between Lahej and Maargh was reported to have been cut, but this was not considered significant of any general Arab hostility. (3) Red Sea. Senior Naval Officer reports under date 24th June in regard to a protest from the Government of India against naval activity at Jidda!] that the Senior Naval Officer of the Red* Sea Patrol had stated that naval action was entirely confined to Turkish military positions, and that nothing was done except at the request, in writing, of the Arab authorities. The attitude of the population of Jiddah was most friendly. (4) The Caucasus. On 11th July Lieutenant-Colonel Marsh telegraphed to D.MJ. a message sent by the Grand Duke to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on that date. The Grand Duke said that the situation was complicated by the hostility of numerous bands of Kurds and other hillmen, who were actively assisting the Turks; this had been brought to the notice of the Persian Government, who had been asked to co-operate to the effect that the Kurds, even if they would not assist the Russian Army, should at least remain quiet. The Grand Duke attached the greatest importance to this, and expressed the opinion that if the Kurds would be induced to appear on the Russian side, the Turks would not be able to maintain their position against General Baratoff. On 17th July, C.T.G.S. telegraphed to Colonel Marsh that the Foreign Office had asked our Minister at Tehran to co-operate with his Russian colleague in bringing- pressure to bear in the direction desired by the Grand Duke. PART III. MISCELLANEOUS. Turkey and Germany. An agent who has travelled through Europe, Turkey, Asia Minor, and Syria, reports that in Constantinople, German shops are quietly boycotted by the Turks; that sentiment against the Germans is very strong ; and that the war is greatly regretted, especially in view of the Russian advances. The Sheikh-ul-Islam resigned because he would not agree to a proclamation proposed by the Germans to retaliate for all future enemy occupation of Turkish territory by a massacre of Christian subjects of Turkey. Public opinion has changed greatly since December last—there is now no bitterness in Constantinople against England or France. In Beirut, on D.M.I. (4094)./■f I I 20th May, 20 English prisoners were marched through the streets and, as they passed, were cheered in English and Erench with cries of “ Vive I’Angleterre.” In connection with this reported change of feeling, it is interesting to note that the Spectator [Sth July) sees signs of a “ reaction in the attitude of the British people towards Turkey,” and strongly disapproves, for “ the gentlemanly behaviour oh “ Turkish officers at Kut and Gallipoli cannot make us forget the horrors of thi “ Armenian massacres or condone the action of Turkish Government in selling “ themselves to Germany.” Treatment of General Townshend. This is still made use of for purposes of propaganda. In the Nieuice Roiter- damsche Courant of 24th June, there was an article by its Balkan correspondent making much of the favourable treatment of General Townshend, and a summary of this has found its way into the English press. The Arab Bureau in Cairo. It has been arranged that the Arab Bureau shall be responsible for propaganda in connection with the Arab movement, the Bureau keeping in close touch with the Foreign and India Offices, the W ar Office and the Admiralty, as well as with the Government of India, which is especially concerned with such propaganda anywhere east of the Suez Canal. As regards propaganda initiated in London, articles should be submitted to M.I. 7, and by them transmitted to the Bureau, who should either deal with them or telegraph approval, disapproval, or amendments to D.M.I., when it is desirable to publish from London. Italian Inquiry an to Ottoman Territory. On 16th July Lord Bertie telegraphed from Paris saying that the Italian Ambassador had raised the question of spheres in Asia Minor and especially in Syria. The President of the Council informed him that there had been conversations in London and Petrograd, but that those conversations could not be considered definite agreements. The Italian Ambassador insisted that Syria was large enough for both France and Italy to be able to satisfy their ambitions and interests, whereupon the President of the Council reminded him that Italy’s position in regard to Asia Minor had been defined by the London Agreement of April 1915, and that the region to which Italy’s aims were directed had, although in general terms, been defined and accepted by the other Powers. The Ambassador replied that he had in view the region of Adalia and Adana, and the President observed that Adalia was in the zone ear-marked by Italy, but that Adana was of special interest to France. The President, in conclusion, expressed his conviction that when peace came all these questions would be settled by the Powers in full agreement with one another.^ A j 3 9 APPENDIX. MEMORANDUM ON THE MECCA AGAINST REBELLION OF THE GRAND SHE RIF OF THE RULE OF THE YOUNG TURK. 0) 1 Lave been greatly interested in the sudden and unexpected action taken by the Grand Sherif to throw off the suzerainty which the “ Committee of Union and Progress” (through the Sultan of Turkey) holds over the sacred places of Islam in Arabia. (2) The Grand Sherif has no doubt taken this action firstly, owing to the long continued and persistent misrule of the Turk over the sacred spots ; and secondly, owing to the folly of the young Turk in breaking with the Great Power which rules over a larger number of Mahommedans than does even the Sultan of Turkey—a Power, moreover, which has always done so much to promote the welfare of the Mahom.nedan religion. (3) The Grand Sherif must have heard, and read with the greatest possible satisfaction the announcement made by the Viceroy of India, on the outbreak of war with Turkey, that Great Britain would refrain from taking coercive measures against the Turks at those Ports on the Red Sea littoral which give access to the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina, provided there was no interference in the pilgrim traffic from India, &amp;c. This was as sound a move on the part of the British Government as it is possible to conceive ; it can best be described as a politico-strategic move of high value, as it at once ranged the Grand Sherif as the firm friend of Great Britain, and it is to our present as well as for our future interests that we should do all in our power to cement this friendship. A friend, no doubt, he has always been, as it would manifestly have been folly for him to quarrel with the Power which sends to him—as custodian of the Holy Places—such ever-increasing hordes of pdgrims, who enrich these sanctuaries with their wealth. (4) The continual revolts of the Arabs in the Yemen, in Mesopotamia, and in Arabia generally, are a matter of common knowlege, and though the Turks have often suffered severely at their hands, the Arabs have never possessed sufficient military resources to enable them to throw off the yoke of a more or less organised Power. Now, however, a unique opportunity has occurred to enable the Grand Sherif to completely throw off his allegiance to Constantinople, and I. sincerely hope that we have lost no time in supporting him with every means at our disposal—physical as well as moral. (5) A mission to the Grand Sherif should start without delay, but, more important than all is the immediate despatch of Indian Mahommedan regiments, machine guns, and artillery. Our Mahommedan troops would fight for this cause—the protection of their Holy Shrines — with the zeal of a fanatic. (G) No doubt a great deal was at once made in India by our authorities when the Grand Sherif announced his revolt against what is nothing more nor less than Young Turk atheism in regard to the Mahommedan religion. The Indian Government should take every step to explain to the leaders of Mahommedanism the true nature of this rebellion ; in so far as it affects their religion, and as it affects the pilgrimages of their co-religionists to Mecca and to the other Holy Places in Arabia. Every true Mahommedan hopes to journey to Mecca at least once in his life. It is, therefore, politically incumbent on the Government of India to make easy, and to foster these pilgrimages to the fullest possible extent, because, by so doing we do more than in any other way to cement the loyalty of the Mahommedans in India. If we were to make a false move now by which the steady flow of this pilgrim traffic was stopped, or even threatened, it would do more than anything to disturb Mahommedan feeling in India, not to put it stronger. S 316 C''IMPH 10 (7) I look upon this revolt of the Grand Sherif as giving us the strongest strategic lever we have .yet had against the Turkish power, and we should use it without delay, and to the fullest possible extent. F'u'sth/ — By sending immediately military assistance in men and munitions, and Secondly —In educating Mahommedan opinion to the true nature of this revolt by sending emissaries to every possible Mahommedan district ; notably to Afghanistan and the many Arab tribes. If we can assist the Grand Sherif dry proclaiming a “Jehad “ against the Young Turk amongst the Mahommedans in Africa and Asia, we shall do more to defeat the Turkish power than we have yet been able to do in either Gallipoli, Egypt, or Mesopotamia. The Sheriff probably sees clearer than anyone that the whole question of IsJamism is to a large extent shaken to its foundations by the fact of Turkey entering this war against Great Britain. (8) What //as already happened is this : Great Britain deposed, as it were, the Sultan of Turkey on the outbreak of war, and immediately set up a new Sultan, with Egypt as his country (centre ?). What we may be certain will happen is as follows :— The Allies will win this war, and, as a result, Turkish power will cease to exist both in Europe and Asia, and with it, the Sultan of Turkey—the Khaliph. The Sherif recognises this more than anybody, and that now is his opportunity for asserting himself as true head of Islamism, and the true descendant of the Prophet. And can anyone argue that this might not end in being the best arrangement ? Geographically it is sound, as he—the Sherif—actually holds sway in Mecca. That he is also revered as a true descendant of the Prophet, and as a Holy man, goes without saying. (9) I foresee very clearly myself that this is even as great an opportunity for Great Britain as it is for the Sherif: We are, I trust, on the eve of driving Turkish power and misrule from Mesopotamia for ever, and it is our mission to regenerate that unhappy country, and to bring it back once more to the rich civilisation which obtained in ancient days. It is a country rich in Holy Mahommedan Shrines, venerated by the numerous tribes of Arabs who really hold sway in Mesopotamia. If we make a firm friend of the Sherif now, as we have it in our power to do, we at once consolidate our friendship with these numerous tribes. It requires no argument to prove how great an asset that would prove to be in taking over the government of this now turbulent country—a strategic asset of the highest possible value, and we should lose no time in setting the necessary machinery in motion, which may be briefly summed up as follows : — (u) Despatch of a mission to the Grand Sherif. (6) Despatch of Mahommedan troops to his assistance. (c) In concert with the Sherif, the despatch of Mahommedan emissaries to every Arab tribe to preach a “ Jehad ” against the Atheist Young Turk. (10) In conclusion, I cannot do better than bear testimony to the loyalty of Indian Moslems : - At the outbreak of war with Turkey, the “ Khaliph of all Mahommedans,” at the instigation of the Kaiser, proclaimed a “Jehad” against Great Britain. It fell flat amongst the millions of that faith whom we govern, and the reason for this failure was due to the loyalty of our 70 millions of Mahommedans in India. This lovalty was voiced by a celebrated Moslem Judge, who may be said to have for ever cemented the affection of his Mahommedan brothers to the British Raj m a beautiful poem, and it may not be inopportune to quote here one verse : — “ Oh England, in thine hour of need Thine equal justice, mercy, grace Have made a distant alien race A part of thee. they whom thy love hath guarded long, They whom thy care hath rendered strong. In love and faith. Their heart strings round thy heart entwine, They are, they ever will be thine, In life, in death.” 'V ■I 11 a.' We have it now in our power to instil this same loyalty and affection into the Jieaits ol millions ol Arabs, l^et ns not miss the opportunity. Uwldiam, Hants, (Signed) 0. H. Powell, ^ 'thJtdy 1.916. Major-General. ^ote on the foregoincj proposals by D. 8. Margoliouth, D. Lilt., F.B.A. The general wisdom of these proposals will, I think, be clear to students of Islamic History and politics, from tlio following’ considerations * . L The custody of the Sanctuaries, Mecca and Medina, is a matter of the utmost importance tor the Islamic communities. The transference of it from an unfriendly to a friendly Power must be highly beneficial to the Allies, who, between them protect a large proportion, perhaps five-sixths, of the Mahommedan population of the y 01 ; 1 ?- yommon hostility to the Turk forms, at any rate for the time, a natural bond Ol mendship between the Allies and the Sherif. 2. Although the religions headship of Islam has at times been usurped by dynasties unconnected with the Prophet’s family, attachment to that family has always been a poweriul motive m the Moslem mind. It seems likely that any loyalty to the Park is h Caliph which may linger in the breasts of the Mahommedan 'subiects of.the Allies would be counteracted by the knowledge that they were fighting for the recovery of supremacy in Arabia and at the Sanctuaries to a descendant of the Prophet, and indeed a descendant whose pedigree is well attested. d. I he relations between Arabs and Turks, which have rarely been cordial, appeal to have been more than ever strained since the proclamation of the Ottoman Constitution, and the attitude adopted by the \oung Turkish Party. In June 1913 an Aiabian Congress was held in Paris, representing an endeavour to consolidate the interests of the Arabic-speaking countries. It seems likely that the secure possession of the Sanctuaries by an Arab potentate would cause the loyalty of the Moslems of Syria and Mesopotamia to gravitate in his direction. 4. Phe consciousness ol the fact that the policy of the pro-German party in Turkey has led to the permanent loss of the Sanctuaries should lead to the discredit and downfall of that party, and more than counteract the effect of the Turkish successes in the Dardanelles and Mesopotamia. For this reason efforts that can be made to secure the Sherif in his occupation are likely to lead to the speedy elimination of the Turk as a combatant. 5. Evidence is now before the world of the almost avowed hostility of the German Government to Islam. It seems clear that such a mission as is contemplated by General Powell would be of great use to the Sherif in furnishing him with material for his proclamations, which might then be circulated among the Moslem subjects of the Allies and their brethren elsewhere with the approval of their religions leaders. (). I he record of the Sherif for competence as a ruler and negotiator would seem (from occasional notices in the Cairene Mahommedan monthly Manar) to be good. V Some account of this should be compiled for the instruction of those who have not followed the internal politics of Arabia in recent times. Oxford, 13th duly 1916, Dear General Powell, With reference to the comments you have asked me to make Memorandum on “ The Rebellion of the Great Sherif of Mecca against the Young Turk.'’ R.G.S., 12th July, upon your Rule of the I quite agree with you that the questions of the Caliphate, the backing of the Sherif of Mecca, and the future of Arabia, are questions demanding the most urgent and careful consideration. The unsatisfactory state of affairs in those regions has been disregarded far too long. The immense latent powers of the Arab people, the far-reaching spiritual prestige held rightly by the Sherif but usurped by the Ottomans, and especially the “ politico-strategic ” importance of the Arabian pemnsula, in my opinion, have not received the attention and consideration they demanded as a potent factor in the war.12 ft I agree with you that our policy for the future should be determined now. The present moment is our opportunity. The Sherif should receive all possible support, for he is our “Trump Card,” and should he be successful, the blow to 'Turkey would be incalculable. It is essential that he should succeed, for besides the loss of prestige to Turkey, it would settlej automatically the question of the Protectorship of the Holy Places of Islam. * The question of actual military aid depends largely upon whether the Sherif can be assisted without the introduction of Christians. I think we should take the utmost care to avoid anything that might be construed into a desire to occupy Arabian territory, or to interfere in the affairs of the Holy province. Hence our difficult}. Christians should not be sent into the Hedjaz under any circumstances. I do not know whether it would be feasible to send a mission composed of Indian and Egyptian Mussulman notables. Arabia is a cock-pit of tribal jealousies and family feuds. They are not going to be settled in a day. If we interfere too much we may have more on our hands than we bargained for. Over a year ago I wrote the following in anticipation of the present crisis :— --t- “ Whatever the outcome of the present struggle may be, one thing is certain with regard to Arabia ; with Egypt under permanent British protection, and our position on the Persian Gulf and in lower Mesopotamia assured, it will prove impossible to leave a nest of hornets in between to endanger our interests. An independent Arabia is thinkable, but an Arab stronghold liable to remittent agitation by Turkish counter agitation is inconceivable. Considering the relative positions of Egypt and India, and the latent possibilities of a great, new ‘ Egypt in Mesopotamia/ it will be seen that Arabia will some day be called upon to play a part in the development of the Near East, which must inevitably follow on the removal of the Ottoman blight.” It is not unreasonable to think of the creation of an independent Arabian Empire, governed by true Moslems, whose behaviour might be guaranteed by a Power, such as Great Britain, who has interests on her borderlands. The Power that holds the ports—Jeddah, Hodeida, Aden, Muscat and Koweit—would speak with dominating accents throughout the whole peninsula . . By obtaining control of the ports, by the establishment of a prestige which would be unchallenged, by accumulating an intimate knowledge of the internal affairs of all parts of the province (which would serves us when dealing with the various tribal feuds) we might be able to use Arabia to the best advantage. The question of the Caliphate must be approached with the utmost delicacy. Although the Turks are (nominally^) Moslems, they are also Asiatic. To anyone who has experienced the distinction between East and West, this is a significant point. The Arabs, even though they were friendly towards us, would be very unwilling to have dealings with Christians with regard to their Holy Places. It is complete independence that they want; this has ahvays been their character. On any question of religion, or one that touches the Holy Places we may be led into very deep water ; Great Britain may, however, be able to deal with the situation through some of her prominent loyal Moslem subjects. The position of the Caliph in these days must be a very difficult one to fulfil. How can there be any longer “a successor to Mahommed—a supreme Governor— supreme Judge and supreme commander of all the Moslems' when Moslems no longer form a compact unity under one leadership ? One other point. Of the inhabitants of Arabia a very large number are nomadic Bedawin, all of whom are fighting men. It is my experience that these tribes care nothing for Islam, and have but one desire—namely—to be free from all restraint and to be left alone to do as they like. It is this element that the Sherif may have difficulty in dealing with. y Yours sincerely, (Signed) Douglas Carl;others. l\S .—I might add that all existing knowledge on Arabia is being collected and tabulated under the direction of the Admiralty War Staff. An Arab Bureau has been established in Cairo, and we are pushing ahead an up-to-date map, which will cover the whole of the peninsula, and contain the latest information.SECRET APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED ARAB REPORT. No. II (New Series). ia Indian Moslem opinion. The Sherif. Mesopo tamia. Press. This week s report contains several items of interest. The interview between Sir A. Hirtzel and Risaldar Major Gul Mawaz Khan gives the point of view of a type of Indian Moslem which is not vocal in the press or at political meetings, but must be representative of a considerable section of opinion. While not venturing to suggest how much weight should be attributed to Gul Mawaz Khan’s views, ft caii be stated confidently that his mental attitude corresponds very closely with that of Turks, Arabs, and Kurds of the'old school who have not received a European education and who have not consequently become members of the “intellectual” political groups who pull Pan-Islamic strings. It is regrettable that men like Gul Mawaz Khan are somewhat laconic and brief and do not make on paper so gieat a show as the anonymous writer whose letter appeared in the Appendix of Arabian Report NXIIa. The Sherif of Mecca’s proclamation should be read, it is a translation of a difficult composition containing many obscure allusions and probably a sprinkling of pious puns and insinuations that cannot be rendered into an alien tongue. However, it is a businesslike document, and leaves the Sherif a free hand to make terms with an alternative Turkish Government. Careful reading of the paper suggests that the Sheiif is not wholh out of touch with the conservative Moslem clergy at Constantinople nor with the partisans of the Liberal Union. Perusal of the manifesto should make it clear that the drench need be under no apprehension that its context could be used against them. The whole burden of the complaint being the bad advice given to and the illicit control exercised over the reigning Sultan. I he Shenf s piocedme m distributing the manifesto himself and leaving the Intelested Entente Powers to publish as much or as little as they choose shows some diplomacy and political firmness. Tlie enlistment by the Turks of French Mohammedan prisoners of war, and the speech of the Turkish M.P. to the Moslem piisoners of wai in Geimany, has one satisfactory aspect as it clears out of our way any necessity for questioning either the propriety of our employing Arab officer prisoners of war against the Turks or our right to propagandise such Arab prisoners of war as have fallen into our hands. The difficulties v Inch we encounter in dealing wffth the wild riparian tribes of Mesopotamia are only to be expected ; these people have, since the days of the Caliphs, been Anaiclusts and outcasts, and their hand is against every man’s; the m ban population of Basra and the Mesopotamian cities have nothing in common with them, nor indeed have the true nomads of the desert. The telegram in the Appendix, which was published in the Times of Monday the 24th, describing an Arab victory at Medina, and appearing as a Central News S 318 30—7/19162 | telegram from Cairo, is a little difficult to understand; no official news of tins event has-been received, and, if it should prove untrue, we shall find that the issue of false news of a favourable kind is as much to be deprecated as the spread of alarming rumours. The Turkish communiques, it will be noticed, make play with the events m the Sinai peninsula, but are silent in regard to the Sherif and the Russian advance in the Caucasus. The situation in Syria still remains obscure, but such indications as there are continue to point to the existence of some disturbance or unrest. The Russian capture of Erzinjan is of political importance since if the Russians hold Erzinjan they will be able to join hands with the Kurds of the Dersim who have been in revolt against the Turks for some time. The Dersini Kinds aie not m touch with the Arab movement proper, but may form a channel of communication with the Kurdo-Arabs of North Mesopotamia, who are probably favourable to the Sherif. The Grand Duke’s suggestion that we should bring political pressure to bear on the Kurds of the Turco-Persian frontier is probably prompted by the idea that we had taken some steps to foster the anti-Turkish and pro-Arab sentiments innate among these tribes. This might have been done had we had a consistent and general policy in regard to the Arab movement, but in the present posture of affairs we can do nothing owing to lack of previous preparation. Should we see fit to adopt a definite line in regard to Arabs and Kurdo-Arabs it would, perhaps, be possible to improve the situation, but it would take time and an efficient propagandist organisation well acquainted with the views and habits of the tribesmen to achieve anything. It may be remarked that the Kurdish officers in the*Turkish army drawn from these districts were generally anti-Committee, pro-British and anti-Russian, this was well known to the Russian Intelligence officers in the Army of the Caucasus.

THE SHERIF OF MECCA. Mission from the CJJ.P. An agent reported on loth July that he had learnt from a member of the Young Turk party thaR acting on advice from Berlin, the C.U.P. had decided to send a mission to the Sherif, headed by his cousin Sherif Haydar Bey and composed of notable Ulema : the object being to advise the Sherif to settle difficulties by arbitra tion, and to offer different administration, other concessions, and gifts of money for tribal chiefs. Should he refuse to accept this advice, energetic military measures would be taken by both Turks and Germans. [ALL 1—06254.] Pilgrimage. On 21st July the Foreign Office telegraphed to the High Commissioner [No. 603 j suggesting that he should without loss of time urge the Sherif to put the arrange ments for the pilgrimage on a satisfactory footing and make a public announcement on the subject. The Sherif himself, the Arab Bureau reports [No. 9], has asked that the pilgrimage shall take place as usual and has suggested a radical reduction in the pilgrimage dues to celebrate the opening of the new regime. Hejaz Railway. The High Commissioner in Egypt telegraphed on 18th July [No. 591] that the Sherif had urged us to cut the Hejaz railway, and that the Commander-in-Chief was considering with the naval authorities the possibility of doing this from Akaba.9 The Proclamation. A translation of the full text of the proclamation, supplied by the Arab Bureau, will be found in the Appendix. The Egypt, telegraphed to D.M I. on 20th July [LG. 942], in answer to telegram of same date, that the full text had been printed by the Sherif at Mecca and that copies had been distributed by him over Syria and Arabia. The proclamation was issued before the Egyptian authorities knew of its existence. The Sherif refused absolutely to consider the question of omitting or adding anything; but he has suggested the issue of a supplement which might be drafted to suit our views or for publication by us. He does not wish us to issue the original proclamation, but to allow' his agents to circulate it: he has sent 30 copies to his Cairo agent which are held up temporarily. A copy was sent by the Sherif to the Sirdar before the question of omitting the Kaaba incident was raised and before the Sherif’s draft had been received ; it was forwarded by the latter to the Kadi of Adis Abeba and has probably been widely distributed. The High Commissioner telegraphing on the following day [K'o. 601] said that it was not known to what extent the Sherif had already circulated his proclamation. When he asked the views of the High Commissioner he had already sent copies to the Kadi of Abyssinia and, it is understood, to religious leaders elsewhere. The High Commissioner now understands that his opinion w T as sought in regard to the manner and form of the publication of the proclamation in countries controlled by the Allies. He advised the omission of the Kaaba incident and has since suggested that the proclamation should be recast so as to avoid controversial theological matters. This he thought would be done. lie added that there was no present intention to publish it in Egypt. The Objections of the French Government to the Proclamation. In this same despatch [No. 601] the High Commissioner expresses the opinion that the French Government must have based their objections on a brief summary of the proclamation which tv as sent them by their liaison officer, and doubts whether the full text could be held to impugn French military or judicial procedure. Opinion in India and Afghanistan in regard to the Sherif. The Viceroy telegraphed on 19th July that in Bengal the opinion of educated Moslems was generally adverse to the Sherif, but that in Assam there was an inclination to regard the movement with favour. In Afghanistan, the Ameer had lefused to allow the publication m Sirajulakhbar of a report of a meeting held on July by the stall of the Habibia College in Kabul, at which the action of the Sherif was condemned. I he V iceroy added that on 13th July the Afghan postmaster at I eshawai sent the Ameer a highly coloured report on India s hostile reception of the news. Ou. 13th July Sn Arthur Hirtzel had an interview at the India Office with a native officer of the 18th Bengal Lancets. lire following note of this interview' has been furnished by the India Office :— Risaldar Maior Gul Mawaz Khan is a Punjabi Muhammadan, and maybe taken as a o- 0 od repre sentative ot his own people. His account of the situation is that the vast majority of the Indian Moslems are too ignorant even of their own religion—to say nothing of outside affairs—to know or care very much who is Caliph and so far as they think about the Ottoman Caliph they regard him as a bad Moslem for laving joined the Germans. The political “ leaders and the anjumans are, of course pro-Turk and Government must reckon with much violent language from them. But they have no influence with the masses, who care only for what the heads of their clans say. But though the masses are thus indifferent they are capable of being moved; and if they always hear only one side of the case, f.e., the pro-Turk sn e, they will naturally believe that to be true. TV hat is essential is to put the other side to them and he is confident that this can be so successfully done as to make the political agitators neo-lmible. His suggestions are (1; that some (say 10) carefully selected Indian officers from France should°take leave MnnlrW In : j; id tln ' e f. to tlie He jf z , it might be arranged that the Grand Sherif should leceive them and tell them his case. They would then go to India (still on leave) scatter to their homes, and relate what they had seen and heard; (2) that the Grand Sherif should put out a proclamation to the Moslem world, which should also bear the signatures of the leading Arab notables • and that a deputation of these notables, with facsimilies of the proclamation, should visit India and give lectures or hold meetino-s. » Opinion in Zanzibar. The Arab Bureau [No. 9, Intelligence Summary] reports that the Sultan of Zanzibar sent a message to the Sherif to express, on behalf of himself and his people thegratification of all true Moslems in his dominions at the news that the Sherif talong active measures to free the Holy Places aud Arabia L^TurS Opinion m Egypt. f ™ r sa'r,?,.r r.‘“i' s&amp;sffz split it into several discordant groups.

The Sherif and the Allies. The Arab Bureau [ibid] also reports that the Sherif has - 'asked for recognition by the Allied Governments. * J Proclamation as Caliph. A reliable agent reported on 22nd July that the Sherif will he proclaimed Caliph at Barram. 1 English Adviser for the Sherif. Sir H. McMahon telegraphed on 23rd July [No. 610] that the Sirdar had asked that Colonel Wilson should wear British uniform at Jidda and have the rank ofBrigadier-General, and that lie had replied that His Majesty’s Government was desirous of avoiding any possible indication of our connection with Hejaz operations, for which reason Colonel Wilson will be styled Pilgrimage Officer. He added that it seemed undesirable to style him Brigadier-General, it would be better that he should be known locally as Mr. \\ ilson Pasha. IDRISI, IMAM AND ADEN. On 17th July the Viceroy in a telegram TP. 2835] in which he expressed his concurrence in the recommendation of the Resident at Aden in regard to Hashid and Bakil, deprecated any attack on Sanaa so long as the Imam does not definitely join the Turks, thinking it obviously undesirable to hustle him from his neutral attitude. He said, too, that he was asking the Resident at Aden to communicate with the Imam again, avoiding mention of territorial claims at present. And replying to this on 21st July the Secretary of State [P. 2S35] said that he presumed any subsidy granted to the Imam would in the first instance be granted for the duration of the war only, and that it would be conditional on the Imam attacking the Turks if and as required. PART II. POLITICAL EVENTS IN FIELDS OF OPERATIONS. (1) Aden. The General Officer Commanding,-A den, reported on 19th July in a telegram to the Chief of the General Stall [6502 G.I.] that the situation was unchanged ; and that a retainer of Abdali Sultan who arrived from Ibb on 15th July reported that there were no signs of disturbance. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on 22nd July that the caravan traffic with Lahej w T as in a normal state. (2) Blockade of Hejaz coast. The Arab Bureau reports [No. 9] that the blockade has been raised so far as Jidda and Leth are concerned; dhows are again trad ing with stores from Egypt and the Sudan. (3) Caucasus. Colonel Marsh telegraphed to D.M.I. on 20th July [T.L. 311] that the Grand Duke in the despatch which was noticed m the.last report [N.S. No. I page 7] meant to ask that we “should not only co-operate iiP diplomatic action but should” ourselves bimg^ clnect piessuie to bear on the [Kurdish] tribes who w T ere causing General Baratoff anxiety.” Colonel Marsh enquires “whether it would not be possible for this to be done by [our] political officers in Mesopotamia ? ” (4) Mesopotamia. Geneial Officer Commanding telegraphed on 22nd July that the situation was quiet. In legald to the tribes on the Hai the Arab Bureau writes ; — the tribes on the Hai or Gharraf are proving- as difficult to us as they have been to the Turks for mam years, fortunately, we are possessed only of their southern border, and so have as yet had no cause to introduce police or hscal measures, or to exercise any sort of administrative control, ronfedp^n n °V i ra g m * he dls f lct call its inhabitants Muntefich to show that they belong to a loose necSiint »11 ° f - tri ^ S ’ f 11 / recognise the Saadun family as the leading family, but without necessai ily allowing the leading family to lead them in any way. a nu 0f r ie . m ? t I nixed °?f n in blood - ' Some are still nomad, some are semi-nomad, whp ,; 1 1 tt ‘ ihej J Ve i n tents or rood-huts, villages or towns.

(1&gt; -THE SHERIF'S PROCLAMATION In the name of God the most merciful, the compassionate. “0 Our Lord iuijr.-e between ns and between our people in truth.” “ Thou art the best of Judges.” 'Ihis is a Copy of our Proclamation to all our Brother Moslems. amo^^tThe Mnsl™ th Tf'l ,lle fir f n P e&lt; ? ple who recognised the Turkish Government amon st the Moslem Rulers and Emirs were the Emirs of Mecca (the blessed) in theTate fhto 6 th % M £ slem ® m th . e w 1 0rld aild to establish their Society (Islam) because the ate Ottoman Sultans (may the dust of their tombs be blessed and may Paradise be their Residence, were acting in harmony with the Holy Book and the Ordinances ( unna) of the Prophet (prayers be upon him) and because they were devoted to the carrying out of Gods Commandments; for the above exalted reasons, the Emirs ieieiied to aie stil] . aclhcnrig tc) thcrii (The Commandments). Verity I have caused tiie Arabs under my personal command to rise against the Arabs (in Yemen) in 1338 m order to raise the siege of Abha and to protect the honour of the Ottoman Empire. n ■ le o owing yeai a similai using took place under the personal command of one of my sons and he (Abdulla) is even now in command of part of my forces. fhe Emirs were still following the Ottoman Empire until the Government of the Union and i rogress Society was organised and laid their hands upon the Administration o± the country and all its affairs, which resulted in its (the country’s) decrease (in prestige) and the destruction of its grandeur, as is quite evident to the whole world, and also owing to their entering the present war and putting their country in a state ot commotion which is also clear to everybody. All this wns done for certain aims which are well known, but are of such a bad chaiacter that our feelings do not allow' us to mention them ; and also, their aims made eveiy Moslem s heart ache and sad for the Moslem Empire, and the disruption and murdering of its people without distinction—some by hanging, some by treachery, and some by deportation in a cruel manner, in spite of what has befallen them (their departed), such as loss of many relatives caused by the inflictions caused by the war, and the Holy Land v 7 as also affected by such calamities which'made the middle classes sell the doors of their houses, their chests of drawers, and even the wmod from the ceilings of their houses, after selling all their furniture and clothes in order to appease their hunger. It seems that the Enion and Progress could not have considered this sufficient for its object, as it has done that which would loosen the only tie between the Ottoman Empire and the Moslems of the vdiole world, which tie is the adherence to the Book (Koran) and the “Sunna.” One of the newspapers issued at Constantinople, El latihad by name, had unit ten the biography of the Prophet (the prayer and peace of God be upon him) in a very disrespectful maimer (God forbid). Such biography v r as seen and heard by the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, and also its Sheikh-Ul- Islam, the Ulema, the [?] Aliens, the Ministers, and the notables. This was followed by the cancellation of God’s v'ords (concerning inheritance): “ The male must obtain the double of the female ” and made them (male and female) equal in inheritance, and this Government of Union and Progress stated also what should be considered the uprooting and destruction of one of the five corner stones of Islam, and that is the fasting of Pam a dam, as the Government (Ottoman) gave orders that the troops w r ho are at Medina, Mecca, and Syria were not to fast, under the pretence that their colleagues are fighting on the frontier of Rum, vdiile this statement is against the following words of God :— “ Those who are sick or on a journey, &amp;e. : ” and such things are not in harmony with Islamic principles. The law on these points is perfectly clear to everybody. Afterwards they (the Union and Progress) destroyed the prestige of the Sultan of Turkey and robbed him of the right of selecting a Chief for his owm Personal Cabinet and prevented him from looking after the interest of Islam and the welfare of his country and its people, and many other things which meant the destruction of the Khalifate conditions v r hich all Moslems demand, and they ignored the interests of all Moslems. S 318 B—— ■■■ 6 AVe (Emirs of the Holy Land) continue to conceal such \entuious doings in oidei to escape the dispersion of the people and not to cieate disunion amongst IMoslems, but finally what they (Turks) concealed became disclosed and the cover was removed, and it then became clear that the Ottoman Empire is m tbe hands of Envei l acha, Jemal Pacha and Talaat Bey, who administrate it as they like and do whatever they like. The evident proof 'of what has been mentioned above is what has been sent lately to the Kadi of the Mohammedan Courfat Mecca, that he should consider in his judgments the evidence written in the Court before him and not consider any evidence that is written by the Moslems amongst themselves, neglecting the verse in the “ Cow,” and, on the other hand, hanging at one time 21 men among the learned Moslems and the Chiefs of Arabs. Amongst them being :— Shefik Bey el Moayad, Shrukri Be} 7 El Asli, Abdel Wahab el Trijlisi, Tewhk Bey el Bassat, Abdel Hamid el Zarawi, Abdel Ghani el Alussi, Emir Arif el Shahabi, El Emir Omar, and the rest are also well known men. No doubt that even the cruellest people w r ould not commit such murder as killing such people all at once in one hour, even ferocious animals woul 1 not do such a thing. Suppose that they had an excuse for murdering these people, what right have they to deport their bereaved and innocent families with children, and old men and women, the ladies of high birth, delicately brought up, in such a manner, as to melt the heart of anyone and make him sad. The} have chastised them severely without limit in spite of their losing the head of their family.. God said :—“ No punishment must be inflicted on anyone for the sins of others.” If we can ever find an excuse for such things, what right had they to confiscate all their lands and personal property and the houses in which they lived, also the money they had in their possession after losing their beloved. If we closed our eyes to all this, and suppose we say they have an excuse for these misdeeds, what excuse can be found for their action in digging up the grave of the Grand Emir and ascetic person our Lord Sayed el Sherif Abdel Kadir el Jezyrly el Hassani, and taking out his blessed bones and scattering them. Ail the above is a brief account of what they have done, and it is left for all the world in general and Moslems in particular to judge. Another proof which expresses what has been concealed in their (Union and Progress) hearts for the religion (Islam) and the Arabs, is their shelling the “Ancient House” (Kaaba) about which God said “And sanctify my House for all comers.” It (Kaaba) is the “ Kibla ” of all the Moslems and the Kaaba of the Unitarians, and two shells of their big guns were fired at it when the country rose for independence. One of the shells fell on the Black Stone, about 2 yards from the edge (of the roof), and the second fell about 3 yards short of the Black Stone (Kaaba) and the Curtain (Kiswa) of the Kaaba was set on tire, which thousands and thousands of Moslems ran to extinguish, making loud shouts of mourning and anger, and they were compelled to open the door of the house and climb to the roof, in order to put out the fire. They did not stop at the second but sent a third shell at the Sepulchre of Abraham. Bits of the shell reached the Mosque, which was their target for the whole time for all their bombs and shells, and every day three or four persons were killed in the Mosque, until it became difficult for the people to come near the Kaaba. We shall leave the verdict on all this conduct and disrespect for the House of God to all the Moslem world. Yes, we leave the verdict of all their conduct and disrespect for the House of God to the Moslem world, but we will never leave our religion and nationality to be the plaything of the Union and Progress Government. God (blessed is He) had given the country the opportunity to take action and rise, and He guided it by His fervent might to obtain its independence, and He also ciowned its endeavours with prosperity and victory after it had been destroyed by the maladministration of the Turkish employees in its garrison.\Y rXhe'Molwn' &gt; ; a ; m , 1Ml ^ ded ,S V° cause victo »y for the reb-Wof tslam and to we 4all ,?mv ,tf i JaSed llp0n ^ Principles of the Mohamedan law, to which In this movement (the rising) we are trying to do our best for the education of all classes of people according to the needs and ability.

Hie Jiibune de Geneve publishes in its issue of 11th July what purports to be the translation of a proclamation issued on 6 th May by Djemal Pasha to the inhabitants of Syria, dealing with the Decentralization Party and its adherents. It says that complete light was thrown on the matter by documents seized at the French Consulate and by the confessions of the newspaper Al-Moufid, of an ex-member of the first tribunal at Kaifa, and others. Ihose affected were taken before a court-martial at Ale y ; those found guilty, whether present or absent, were condemned. Twenty-one notable persons weie sentenced to death \ eight others were sentenced to imprison ment for periods varying from five to fifteen years ; and thirty-two were acquitted. Of ^ those condemned to death some had been executed at Damascus and others at Beirut on the same day as that on which the proclamation was issued. He published, he said, in the original French, with translations in Turkish and Arabic, the documents seized at the Consulate which proved that there was an understanding between the Decentralization Party and the French Government. These documents showed — ( 1 ) That those concerned had placed themselves at the service of England and France against whom the Moslem world had declared the holy war. (2) The real intentions of France which had so often declared that she would respect Turkish independence, and those intentions showed how right Turkey was to fight her. (3) That the movement was confined to Moslems and Christians of no importance, all of whom have been condemned either in person or par contumace. Discretionary power having been granted him he meant to deport to Anatolia all those who sacrificed imperial interests to their own ; there they will be given an equivalent for their possessions in Syria. The papers seized comprised seven documents addressed by the French Ambassador at Constantinople, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the French Consuls at Damascus and Beirut, dealing with the Syrian question and with the national movements of the Syrian people. The object of the Decentralisation Party was clearly shown in these papers—the independence of Syria with the help and under the protection of France. Visit of a Turkish M. P. to the Gamp at Zossen. The India Office supplies the following translation, from an unnamed German- newspaper, of a speech in Turkish delivered during the visit of the Turkish&gt; 8 deleo-ates to tlie camp at Zossen where the Moslem prisoners of war are interned bv MustafaNedin Bev, Turkish M.P. and President of the National Defence Society ^ are o-lad to 'have been invited here by the exalted German Government. \v e brino- you th^greetings of our Ruler and Caliph, since you are our brothers in faith. For a soldier it is a great misfortune to be taken prisoner. But you have net fought for vour rio-hts, for your faith and for your home; you have been dragged into the conflict by*force. Thanks to the extraordinary goodness of the exalted German Government respect is shown for your religion, your customs and usages, nay more, that in which you Lave been hindered at home, the acquisition of leading and wilting, is provided for you here. Special instructors have been summoned hither to instruct vou in your religion and language. We hope that you are showing yourselves grateful,' and that you will spread farther among your brolhers_ at home what you have learnt here. Remember always that you are sons of the Turkish people, a people of nearly 70 million souls, a people occupying a territory that extends from the Balkans'to Mongolia. If you have that in mind you will progress, and a day_ will come when it is to be hoped that me shall all be united, welded together into a single people. In conclusion I beg you in gratitude to remember in prayer our exalted ruler the Caliph, his illustrious ally the Emperor Wilhelm IF, our allied and victorious armies, and the great German and' Turkish peoples. Hurrah. ^ Tchok Yashasyn.” Those present joined enthusiastically in the cheers. The speech was then translated by the priest of the prisoners’ camp into Tatar. It alien in the original. Fighting at Medina. The Central News published a telegram from Cairo saying that on Friday last (21st July) severe fighting was going on at Medina ; that the Turkish garrison had attempted a sortie but had beeimlriven back ; and that in this sortie the Turks had suffered 2,500 casualties, and those of the Sherif 500.
