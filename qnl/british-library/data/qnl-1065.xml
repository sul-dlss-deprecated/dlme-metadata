In the letter Tronson writes of his journey to the Arab coast, and his meetings with Sheikh Hamdan ben Thanoon, brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, and Sheikh Said ben Butye [Sa'id bin Butti], ruler of Dubai. Tronson warns both against committing breaches of the Maritime Truce;2) A translated extract of a letter (ff 213-14) from Hajee Yacoob, British agent at Sharjah, to Kemball, dated 11 November 1852. The letter is a continuation of Yacoob's report on the succession struggle at Dubai, in the wake of Sheikh Maktum bin Butti's death. Yacoob reports that the sons and brother of the late Sheikh have fled to Ra's al-Khaymah, where they have sought the protection of Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x000050#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
