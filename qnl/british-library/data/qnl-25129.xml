(For Office use only.) Memorandum on Foreigners in India. ’ 1. General. —With the outbreak of the war the question of the treatment of foreigners in India has acquired prominence. Their position is not in all respects comparable with that of foreigners—or, as they are called in British legislation, “aliens,”—in the United Kingdom, particularly if regard be had to the comparatively small European population in India. But it may be useful, first, to refer briefly to the powers exercised in the United Kingdom with regard to aliens. 2. Legislation in the United Kingdom. —In this country a special Act was passed on the outbreak of war—the Aliens Restriction Act, 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. V., Ch. 12). It gave power to impose restrictions on aliens by Order in Council, and under it a series of such Orders were passed which 'were finally combined in the 7 i 78 - 87 Ij0nd0 ' CTazette ’” No - 28im ' PP- Aliens Restriction (Consolidation) Order, 1914, dated 9th September 1914. It may be remarked that in this Order (Article 31) the expression “ alien friend ” is defined as “an alien whose Sovereign or State is at peace with His Majesty,” and the expression “alien enemy” as “an alien whose Sovereign or State is at war with His Majesty.” One provision which indirectly concerns the India Office is that in Article 10 :—“ An alien enemy “ shall not .... embark in the United Kingdom at an approved “ port, unless provided with a permit issued by a Secretary of State.” . 3. The Foreigners Act, 1864.—The Act of the Indian Legislature which has until recently regulated in the main the position of foreigners in India is the Foreigners Act, 1864 (Act No. 3 of 1864). It defines “ foreigner ” as “ a person not being either a natural-born subject of His Majesty .... “ or a Native of British India,” and its preamble runs as follows : — “ Whereas it is expedient to make provision to enable the Government to “ prevent the sub jects of Foreign States from residing or sojourning in British “ India, or from passing through or travelling therein, without the consent “ of the Government, it is enacted as follows . . . .” It may be convenient to give a brief account of its chief provisions. 4. Its provisions — Sections 1-4.-—Section 2 places on any person as to whom a question shall arise the onus of proving that he is not a foreigner. Section 3 empowers Government to order any foreigner to remove himself from British India, and its wording may be quoted in full :— “ The Governor-General of India in Council may by writing order any foreigner to remove himself from British India or to remove himself therefrom by a particular route to be specified in the order ; and any Local Government may by writing make the like order with reference to any foreigner within the jurisdiction of such Government.” Section 4 provides for the apprehension and detention of any foreigner refusing, after order, to remove himself from India or returning without a license from the Government of India or the Local Government. Until the present war the first four sections of the Act were alone operative. The remaining sections could, under Section 5, be brought into force by notitication in the Gazette of India, and on the 8th August last such a notification was in fact issued (Appendix I). A brief account of these sections therefore follows. 5. Its remaining provisions — Sections 5-25.—Sections 6 and 7 require every foreigner to report in writing his arrival in India with particulars asto his name, nationality, destination, object, &amp;c. Section 10 is important and runs :— “ T^o foreigner shall travel in or pass through any pait of Ihitish India ^ in which all the provisions of this Act are for the time being in force without a license.” The succeeding Sections, 11-19, deal with the description of such license the conditions of its grant, the apprehension of foreigners travelling without, or contrary to, those conditions, the procedure upon apprehension, the removal from India of the persons appiehended, and the piohibition of persons not being natural-born British subjects from travelling or passing through any part of India without a license. Sections 20-24 deal with the procedure as regards vessels on which foreigners may be and prescribe various penalties, and Section 2d runs as follows :— “ The Governor-General of India in Council or the Local Government of any part of British India in which this Act may, for the time being, be in force, may exempt any person, or any class of persons, either wholly or partially, or temporarily or otherwise, frorn^ all or any of the provisions of this Act contained in any of the Sections subsequent to Section 5 and may at any time revoke any such exemption.” By the resolution of the 8th August already mentioned (printed as Appendix I.) the Government of India put in force for six months Sections 5-25 of the Act, while they at the same time exempted— “ (a) from the provisions of Section 5 and all the subsequent Sections of of the said Act all foreigners being Asiatics, and “(b) from the provisions of Sections 10-19 of the said Act all non- Asiatic foreigners not being of German or Austrian nationality.” As the result of this, an Italian, for example, would be required to report his arrival in India, while a Chinaman would not; a Belgian would be enabled to travel without a license in India, while a German would not. 6. The Foreigners Ordinance, 1914.—The Foreigners Act as explained above permitted (n) the deportation of undesirable foreigners; (b) the registration of new arrivals; and (c) restrictions upon the journeys of foreigners within India. But these measures by themselves were recently held on military grounds to be insufficient. It was considered essential on those grounds to take authority— (1) To prohibit or regulate and restrict in such manner as may be thought lit the entry of foreigners into, and their departure from, British India. (2.) To regulate or restrict in such manner as may be thought fit the liberty of foreigners residing or being in British India. (3) To impose an obligation upon householders, if so desired, to report the temporary or permanent residence of foreigners within their houses. To effect these objects a special “ Ordinance ” (Appendix II.) was pro mulgated by the Governor-General on the 20th August 1914, in exercise of the power vested in him by the Indian Councils Act, 1861 (Section 23). It will be seen on reference to it that Section 8 provides that “ the “ Governor-General may delegate, subject to such conditions and restrictions “ as he thinks fit, all or any of his powders under this Ordinance to any civil “ or military authority in British India, either by name or in virtue of his “ office”; also (Section 11) that no order made under Section 3 of the Ordinance (“ power to prohibit or regulate entry, departure, and residence of foreigners ”) shall be called in question in any Court. 7. Notifications under the Ordinance. —Besides the Ordinance itself we have received copies of three Notifications by the Government of India thereunder, Home Department, Political, Nos. 907-10, dated the 22nd August 1914 (Gazette of India, Extraordinary, of same date).The first, under Section 8 , delegates certain powers to all Local Governments. The second, also under Section 8 , delegates certain powers to the military authorities in respect of foreigners residing in their commands, as well as “ male subjects of the German Empire ” between 20 and 40 years of age and “male subjects of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary” between 21 and 34 years of age. The third, under Section 3, (Appendix III.), is important from the stand point of this Office. It provides inter alia that “ no foreigner shall enter “ into or depart from British India by sea except by the ports of Calcutta, “ Madras, or Rangoon.” (No mention of Bombay or Karachi). It further explains that nothing in it shall “(a) apply to any Asiatic foreigner; or “ (b) be deemed to prohibit any foreigner from entering into or departing “ from British India in accordance with the terms of any permit granted by “ the Governor-General in Council or some officer empowered by the “ Governor-General in Council in this behalf.” * Telegrams— Prom Secretary ot‘ State to Viceroy, dated 2nd September 1914, J. and P. 3579.

Aliens going to India from the United Kingdom.-—The procedure with regard to aliens desiring to go to India from the United Kingdom has been settled in communication with the Government of India.* “Alien friends” who apply here and satisfy the Secretary of State as to their bona fides may be given an assurance in writing that they will be permitted to land in India (at any port) on the understanding that they will be subject to any restrictions that may be applicable to their case. As regards “ alien enemies,” the Secretary of State has undertaken to make a prior reference to the Government of India in any case in which it may primd facie appear that permission to land in India (at a port to be arranged) may be exceptionally conceded. The “ permit to embark in the “ United Kingdom at an approved port ” (see paragraph 2 above) will not be granted by the Home Office to alien enemies wishing to go to India except after reference to the India Office. 9. Warning to Steamship Companies .—At the instance of the Govern ment of India a notice (Appendix IV.) has been distributed to Steamship Companies warning them against booking aliens to ports other than Calcutta Madras or Rangoon (J. and R. 4079.)

Beli, K.C.V.O., Political Resident, Aden io-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. 1 have the honour to invite the attention of Government to the question of the recruitment of Arabs by the Italian Government for militarvMnnW service in their African Colonies and possessions. y P a x^'r 190.% the Italian Benadir Company sent agents to Mokalia to enlist Arabs for (armed) police service on the Benadir Coast without the knowledge 01 consent of the British authorities. The matter coming to the knowledge of the Resident, he detained the recruits for the time being and telegraphed to Government for instructions. In the meantime, the Italian Ambassador t0 the ^ telegrams iW /Ae Secretary of State for India to the Resident, dated 29th April 1903. Mn ( ,ra- ta ? ian f . st , ates that y° u haTe forbidden departure for p, ° discio of 100 Arab Askaris recruited for Italian Benadir Company Blea,se report by telegram immediately whether Askaris in question are 1 sub -J ec ^: s » or 011 w ^ at grounds they are being detained. Every facility that law permits should be given to the Italian Government in this matter. ” ^ Resident's reply, dated 30th April 1903, . , ^rah Askaris * * * were enlisted at Mokalla, a port included in the Aden Protectorate, for Benadir Police, by agents sent by the Italian Benadir Company. Neither this Besidency nor the Bombay Govern ment had received any intimation on the subject; the Acting Italian Consul at Aden was equally in the dark; and I had no means of knowing whether the Benadir Company was acting under the authority of the Italian Govern- ment. The Bombay Government, to whom I telegraphed for instructions, nave sent me an ad interim reply, promising full instructions. I will now give permission for any of the Askaris, who may not be British subjects, to proceed to their destination .' •» r considerations which induced His Majesty’s Government to allow this recruitment will be seen from the following extract of a letter from the loreign Office to the India Office, dated the 28th April 1903 “His Majesty’s Government desire in any case to meet the wishes of the 1 alian Government in anything which may assist in maintaining order and good administration in the Italian Protectorate of the Benadir, and that it would be most unfortunate if at a moment when we are pressing the Italian AIf If l\f 1,1:'If 1 W |I| 1 | i : F* ■ m i i l li! i-i I Government to fulfil its obligations in regard to measuies of co-operation with us in Somaliland, we were, even in appearance, to obstruct their efforts in that direction.” 3. I have no record of the number of men recruited for the Benadir Coast * in 1903. But in April 1905 the Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Government of India informing them that enquiry had been made by the Italian Ambassador as to whether it would be possible for 400 or 500 Askaris to be recruited in the neighbcurhood of Mokalla for service in Italian Somaliland and remarked that he presumed there would be no objection so long as no British subjects were enlisted. After obtaining the consent of the Resident and of the Government of Bombay, the Secretary of State for India in a letter, dated the 29th April 1905, informed the Foreign Office that the Government of India had reported by telegram that they would raise no objection, provided that no British subjects were enlisted. 4. These recruiting operations begun on a modest scale at Mokalla soon expanded. The Italian Government represented in February 1906 that, although they had sent experienced agents to different parts of Arabia and there was no scarcity of able bodied men, they failed to secure a sufficient number of recruits and requested that the British authorities at Aden might be instructed to second, or at any rate not to hinder, the action of their agents. The following reply was telegraphed by the Government of India to the Secretary of State on the 20th April 1906:— “ It is reported by the Resident at Aden that Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla is not unnaturally averse from any action which might be construed into co operation with Italian endeavours to coerce the inhabitants of the coast districts concerned, inasmuch as he derives considerable profit from the trade which passes between his port of Mokalla and the Benadir and Mijjertain coast. No hindrance will, however, be placed in the way of the Italian recruiting agent by the local British officials. ” Shortly afterwards (in November 1906) the Italian Consul at Aden asked the Resident to permit him to enlist Askaris in the neighbourhood of Aden and Dthala, which permission was granted on the understanding that no British subjects were engaged. It will be seen from the Resident’s telegram of the 3rd April 1908, sent in reply to enquiries from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, that every assistance asked for by the Italian authorities here has been afforded; and I now- address Government with a view to ascertaining how long this assistance should be continued. It will be observed that two ag encies have been at work for carrying on this recruitment—one at Mokalla and the other at Aden. I have no information as to the number of men shipped from Mokalla. But going through the records, it appears that the following number of men was shipped from Aden :— 1906 1907 1903 1909 1910 1911 1912 (October*December) 1913 300 men 504 „ 1,178 „ 1,131 „ 940 „ 1,277* „ 671* „ 1,439 „ This total is considerable, but I am inclined to think that it falls short of the actual figures. The recruits come largely from Turkish Arabia, but a good many men from the tribes in our Protectorate enlist themselves. It has been understood here from the beginning that His Majesty’s Government had no objection to the enlistment of British Protected subjects. All recruits are * The recruitment was stopped during the Turco-Italian war—Foreign Office letter ft T o. 38059—11* 3rd October 1911.3 enlisted at Dar-al-Amir, just across our border, but are mostly from the normal strength that comes to Aden from the Hinterland in search ^employ! 6. This recruitment naturally affects the Aden labour market, and I have had complaints to that effect from the Chamber of Commerce, the Shipping Agents and the Public Works Department. Moreover, although the enlist ment is nominally carried on beyond our jurisdiction, a good many men are secretly engaged in Aden itself and complaints have been made to me even by the Italian Salt Works Company at Sheikh Othman. I think that it is high labour f rom Aden U ° Sh ° Uld ^ d ° ne ^ “ “ 0t t0 St ° P ’ thi9 emi S rati&lt; &gt;“ of 7. There is another point for consideration. Speculation has been rife from the beginning as to the object of the Italian Government in enrolling these men. It was stated at first that they were required for Police purposes only. But it is well known here that they are trained to the use of fire-arms and have taken pait in Italian campaigns in Somaliland and even in Tripoli A batch of 500 of these men were shipped only a month ago from the Benadir Coast to Tripoli. This is an entirely new departure. As may be gathered a certain percentge of these men never return to their homes, but a good many do return and being pampered with too good treatment and lax discipline carry tales of Italian goodness and greatness into a tract of country which has so far been very suspicious of Italian activity. It seems to be bad policy to encourage this leaven of Italian influence into the Yemen and,to have at our back a body of men trained to the use of modern arms of precision and ready to take service with the Imam or any malcontent that may choose to cause mischief in our Protectorate.SEC BUT.

Premising that it is most desirable that the British Government should possess unquestionable power to exclude foreigners from the territories in question, I am to say that the Secretary of State for India felt some doubt whether the practice of the local authorities did not to some extent outrun their treaty rights. The treaties will be found in \ oh XIII. of Aitehisoli’s work, and attention is invited especially to numbers 23, 24, 30, 31, 37, 43-45, 47-52, 54-60, 65, 66 , 68-72, 76' 77 79, 81-83. ’ ’ It is clear that these treaties confer certain powers upon the British Government as against the Chiefs concerned ; but it is not clear whether they confer those powers as against foreigners. They entitle the local authorities to ‘ advise ’ the Chiefs not to admit foreigners and to enforce that advice. But do they justify a statement to the Italian Government in terms so wide as those used by the Assistant Resident at Aden to the Acting Consul-General for Italy, that “it is not possible to permit the “ subjects of a foreign power to prospect in tracts which are under the protection of His Majesty s Government, or his refusal of permission to that official to visit Lahej ? In connection with this latter incident it appears from paragraph 6 of the Governor of Bombay’s letter of 9 th November last that the procedure followed in the case of a French subject in 1901 was “ to advise the Padhthli Sultan to cause him to withdraw from his territory ” ; and it will be remembered that in August la-st, when a Turkish Consul was reported to be about to visit the Trucial coast (with whose Chiefs the Government of India have somewhat similar treaties), it was proposed to send a ship in advance and warn the Sheikh that he should refuse to allow him to land. It appears to the Secretary of State for India that the procedure followed in these two cases w'as the correct one. But it will be seen that the Government of India and the Government of Bombay have no doubt that their practice is in accordance with the treaties, though it is not clear that the latter Government appreciate the difference between the two methods of procedure indicated above, and in paragraph 7 of their letter they have misapprehended the intention of the Secretary of State. In view, therefore, of the increasing attention that is likely to be paid in future by Foreign Powers to the regions in question, His Lordship would be glad to have the views of the Foreign Office on the point at issue, and to know whether, if such a proposition as that of the Acting Resident were laid down (for example) in connection with Abu Musa, and were challenged by the German Government, Secretary Sir E. Grey would be prepared to defend it. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, R. Ritchie, Foreign Office. S. 143.Enclosure No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, No. 4738.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1 st ultimo, regarding the extent to which, under the treaties in force, His Majesty’s Government have the right to prevent foreign subjects from entering or prospecting in the territory of the protected chiefs in the neighbourhood of Aden. 2. I am to inform you in reply that Sir E. Grey is disposed to consider that the wording of the treaties in question justifies, as it stands, the prevention of such proceedings, and that be concurs in the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Crewe that the course followed in the last two cases quoted in your letter is preferable to that adopted on the first two occasions mentioned as a means of making such prevention effective. 3. It appears however to Sir E. Grey that, though according to the strict wording of the treaties the chief concerned in each case or his representative is the proper person to inform a particular foreign subject that he must not enter nor prospect in the territory of the tribe, it is undesirable to deprive the Resident at Aden or other British officer of the power to discourage from such action any individual who may apply to him for permission to enter tribal territory, and 1 am accor- diugly to suggest that instructions should be sent to the officers to whom such an application is likely to be made to reply to it by saying that the chief in question has no power to grant it under the terms of the treaty in force between him and His Majesty’s Government.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT, SECRET. External. To My Lord Marquis, The Most Honourable the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., Bis Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Calcutta, the 4th January 1912. In reply to Your Lordship’s secret despatch, No. 21 , dated the 4th August 1911, enquiring how far our attitude in regard to subjects of a Foreign Power who wish to enter, or prospect within, the Aden Protectorate, is consist ent with treaty rights or with recognised practice, we have the honour to # No. 8735 (Confidential), dated the 9th November forward, for Your Lordship’s information 1911, a copy of a letter* on the subject from the Government of Bombay, from which it will be seen that the restrictions placed on the movements and enterprise of foreign subjects within the Protectorate are in accordance generally with existing practice and our treatv rights with the Chiefs. 2 . It will also be observed that the Bombay Government do not consider it desirable to adopt the course, suggested by Your Lordship, of allowing the Protectorate Chiefs, after discussion with the Resident, to take the responsibility of admitting foreign prospectors. On the other hand, if it is thought that the powers at present exercised by us are in accordance with the spirit rather than the strict letter of the treaties, the Bombay Government recommend the strengthening of the clause, contained in all the Protectorate treaties, prohibiting the protected States from corresponding, or making treaties or agreements with foreign nations or Powers. 3. We concur generally in the views of the Government of Bombay, and the action recently taken under their authority in the matter of the relations of foreign Consuls and subjects with the Protected Chiefs of South Arabia appears to us to he within their powers and to be justified by the circum stances. We see no necessity for any alteration of the treaties. The authority under which we control the grant of concessions to, and the movements of 5s \ 2 r foreigners in the Protected States is well established and, like that exercised by us in the States in India, is based on usage independently of Treaty provi sions.

Kincaid, Esq., Secretary to Government, Bombay, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 1551-E.B., dated the 23rd •No, 21 -Secret, dated the 4 th August i 9 ii. August 1911, forwarding a copy of the A 0 , marginally cited despatch* from His Majesty s Secretary of State and to reply as follows. 2 . The Secretary of State has quoted in his despatch 4 cases in which the Governor in Council took exception to outsiders entering or seeking to initiate commercial enterprises within the territories of the protected Chiefs of South Arabia. The first case in order of time was that in which the Governor in Council prohibited on the 24th March 1910 the Eadthli Sultan from granting a coal concession to an Arab merchant of Aden called Sheikh Saleh ^Balaxa. The second case was that in which the First Assistant refused, when asked by the Consul-General for Italy, to give an unrestricted permission to Italian subjects to start wireless stations, commercial and engineering enterprises and generally to exploit the State of Shehr and Mokalla. The third case was the refusal of the Resident^ to permit the Italian Consul General to visit Lahej. The fourth case was that in which the Bombay Government recently insisted that the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla should ask their permission beford^ranting a prospecting concession to the Eastern Syndicate Limited. 3. The fourth case in order of time must, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, be distinguished from the others. For the applicants for concession were Englishmen and not foreigners. Now it is obvious that treaties drawn up by an English Government could not contain a clause which prohibited the party from communicating or making agreements with I he guide, therefore, to such a case must he found in This in the opinion of the Governor in Council fully other contracting O British subjects, existing practice. f Governirx'nt of India dated 24th July 1896. telegram No. 1303 E.A., supported his action. In 1896 the Govern ment of India concurred! with the Go vernment of Bombay in refusing to allow a certain Thomas Brown, a jockey, to enter the service of one Nawaz Jung in the territories of Mokalla. In 1905 it was laid down in the case of A. Knox Brown that the previous approval of the Government of India was necessary to an agreement to exploit and develop Government of India letter No. 1328 -e.b., dated the country round Aden and the Island t e 1 st April 1905 . ^ 0 £ s oco tra. In the same year it was decided that only with the previous sanction of Government could a Mr. Kirkpatrick obtain a guano concession from the Sultan of Socotra. As may be seen from page 1S8, Volume XIII, Aitchisou’s Treaties, the latter’s relations with Government are very similar to those of the South Arabian Chiefs. Thus three instances have occurred in which Government have enforced their privilege of refusing Englishmen from entering the Arab States under their protection. 4. In the second and third cases in order of time mentioned by the Secre tary of State the applicants were foreigners. As regards the former, attention is invited to the Mokalla treaty of 1882 at page 175 Aitchison’s Treaties. In Article 1 the Sultan agreed not to dispose of his possessions or territories or any part thereof to any person or Power other than the British Government. Now the Consul General, as I have said, asked for a general permit to Italian subjects to establish electric stations and initiate commercial enterprises in Mokalla. The establishment of stations and the initiation of such’ enterprises necessarily involved a grant of land. This would have been a disposal of part of the Sultan’s territories to a person other than the British Government and is expressly forbidden by the above article. It is no doubt true that the Mokalla treaty of 1882 was followed by that of 1888 at page 176 ibid, but the latter merely recites with greater emphasis the dependence of the Sultan. It does not abrogate the former treaty. For instance Article 4 of 1882 treaty provides for a payment of the stipend to the Sultan. It still holds goodmm i A although not referred to in the 1888 treaty. Thus the Resident was absolutely within his treaty rights in giving the answer which he did to the Italian Consul General. 5 . In the third case the same Consul General wished to visit Lahej. Now if the official representatives of foreign powers are to he at liberty to establish themselves at the capitals of the South Arabian Chiefs, the latter will be on exactly the same footing as independent States. There will in fact be an abrogation of the protectorate. It is further obvious that the Consul General’s intention was to secure concessions. He had already tried to do so in MoKalla; and Lahej has no attraction for the ordinary sightseer. Now a concession to the official representative of a foreign power is of course a concession to the power itself. But attention is invited to Article 2 of the Abdali treaty at page 91, Volume XIII of Aitchison’s Treaties. Thereby the Sultan is expressly prohibited from entering into any agreement or treaty with any State other than the British Government, for the sale, mortgage, lease or hire or gift of any portion of his territories. A concession involves one at least of the above. Thus the object of the Consul General’s visit was to violate the Abdali treaty and the Political Resident, Aden, was right in forbidding it. 6 . There remains the communication made on the 24th March 1910 by the Resident to the Radthli Sultan. One Sheikh Saleh Balaxa wished to work a coal mine in the Sultan's State. It is not clear whether the Arab was a British .subject or not. If he was a British subject the action of Government in preventing him was, as I have shown, supported by existing practice. If he was not, then attention is invited to the case of Lewis Massot. He was a Frenchman employed in 1901 on certain salt works in the Fadthli State. The •Govemmentof India, letter No. 687 -e.a., dated Government of India authorised* the soth April 1901. Governor in Council to advise the Eadthli Sultan to cause him to withdraw from his territory if any political inconvenience was apprehended from his continued employment. Now it is certain that had the coal mine been leased to Sheikh Saleh Balaxa he could not have worked it without importing Europeans in such numbers as to have caused political inconvenience. Thus no matter what the nationality of Sheikh Saleh Balaxa, the action of the Governor in Council was justified by precedent. 7. In conclusion I am to state that the Governor in Council is of opinion that it would be perilous to allow, as suggested by the Secretary of State, the Chiefs of South Arabia to take after discussion with the Resident the responsi bility of admitting foreign prospectors. It is impossible to dissociate the individual from his Government. If one subject of a foreign power be admitted, it is impossible to refuse admittance to an unlimited number of others. Their welfare or ill-treatment cannot be disregarded by their Government and the ingress of a single foreigner may easily lead to a demand for intervention on his behalf by a foreign Government. On the other hand if it is thought that the existing treaties with the majority of the protected States do not empower Government to refuse the demands of isolated foreign prospectors, the remedy lies in correcting the wording. All of the treaties contain a clause which prohibits the protected States from corresponding or making treaties or agreements with foreign nations or powers. The Governor in Council holds the view that this clause should be deemed to prohibit likewise a corres pondence, agreement or treaty with a member of a foreign nation or a subject rt *ire orgli t of tie ^ risWtoJ India Office, London, 4th August 1911 Secret, No. 21. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Loud, I desire to invite Your Excellency’s attention to the correspondence connected with the grant by the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla of a prospecting concession to the Eastern Syndicate, Limited. S.^In the letter of the Bombay Government Eo. 3503, of 23rd May 1911, it is stated that the Sultan “ has _ been informed that the Governor of “ Bombay will not approve of any outsiders being “ allowed inside his territory without their previous “ sanction,” and I observe that on 24th March 1910 they directed the Resident at Aden to make a similar communication to the Fadthli Sultan. Again, in your telegram to me of 21st June, Your Excellency states that the sanction given to prospectors by the Sultan of Mokalla was invalid until the Bombay Government had accorded their permission. . 3. Further light upon the relations of the British Government with the protected chiefs of South Arabia and the neighbourhood in such matters has recently been thrown by a letter addressed on 23rd December last by the First Assistant to Resident at Aden to 'the Acting Consul-General for Italy in which the latter was informed (in connection with the Sultan of Mokalla) that “ it is not possible to permit the subjects of a “ Foreign Power to prospect in tracts which are “ under the protection of His Britannic Majesty’s “ Government.” I understand that the Government of Bombay are of opinion that, the British pro tectorate over this part of Arabia being beyond dispute, there would be no difficulty in sub stantiating the Resident’s language diplomatically. 4. I further understand that the Resident at Aden has recently refused permission to the Italian Consul-General to visit Lahej, holding, apart from political objections, that the grant of permission would have entailed the provision of an escort and have involved British responsibilities. 5. 88.5. It is obviously of great importance that Government should possess the powers thus claimed for it. But I think it desirable that Your Excellency in Council should now consider how far the actions taken and the language used in the matters referred to are consistent with our Treaty rights or with recognised practice in the Aden Protectorate, and if not, whether any amendment of treaties and practice is called for. It would be inconvenient if any Foreign Power should challenge the restrictions put on the movements of their Consuls or the enterprise of their subjects, and if it should then be found that claims had been asserted which could not be maintained. If, for instance, it is necessary that foreigners should not enter .tribal territory or prospect within it, it must be considered whether existing treaties are suffi cient to empower the Resident to refuse permission, or whether the Chiefs concerned should not, after discussion with the Resident, take the responsi bility. 6 .
