                           Treaties and Undertakings in Force between the British Government and the Sultans of Maskat [Muscat] and Oman, 1845-1914(Government of India Foreign and Political Department). The treaties recorded cover the slave trade, Zanzibar, telegraphs, commerce, cession of territory, arms traffic, and the Sur coalfields. The texts of the treaties appear in both English and (from the rear of the volume) Arabic. A note below the title on folio 4 [folio 40 of the second volume] states that in the event of doubt arising as to the precise interpretation of any portion of one or other of the Treaty stipulations, the English text was to be considered decisive.The second volume is a further copy of the same document. This is part of a file that also contains some loose papers. These are: text of agreement dated 28 September 1920 between the Government of Sultan Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr], Sultan of Muscat and Oman and Sheikh Isa bin Salah bin Ali al-Harthi on behalf certain Omanis, signatories to the agreement; letter from Sayyid-bin-Taimur [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr] to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf acknowledging receipt of his letter informing him of the abdication of his father and his appointment as successor as Sultan of Muscat and Oman; and transcript of treaty between the United Kingdom and Sultan Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr], Sultan of Muscat and Oman, dated 5 February 1939, which replaced the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1891.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">scribe</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh 'Īsá bin Ṣāliḥ al-Ḥārithī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">scribe</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abū-Shahr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hormuz Isle</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002c8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
