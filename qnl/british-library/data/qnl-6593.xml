[In contiimatioii of Memorandum of August 6, 1892.] Guttur or El-Katr Coast. SIR C. EOIID lias learnt, from a secret source, that the Council of Ministers at Constantinople have recommended to the Sultan to endeavour to separate from England those Sheikhs in Arabia who have made Treaties with her, and, for that purpose, to send emissaries to them with presents. In April the Porte informed Sir C. Eord that the Sultan contemplated sending a punitive expedition to the El-Katr Coast, where Jasim- hin-Muhammad-bin-Thani, the Kaimakam, had made opposition to the authority of the Yali of Bussorah. The Sultan hoped to receive the support of Her Majesty's Government. Colonel Talbot, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, was instructed to go in a ship of war to make inquiries and arrange matters, and the Porte was recommended to leave the question to the mediation of Her Majesty's Government. To this the Porte objected, maintaining El-Katr to be Turkish territory, and the Sultan, rather than give any countenance to British interven tion, seems to have preferred to abandon the idea of proceeding to extremities, and to endeavour to procure by indirect means the voluntary sub mission of Jasim-bin-Thani. Colonel Talbot arrived at El Bidaa on the 26th April. The Vali of Bussorah, who had taken refuge on board the Turkish ship of war off El Bidaa, refused to recognize any mediation by Colonel Talbot, and protested against his landing at ♦ Extracted from Eastern Department Memorandum of October 15, 1893 (Confldential Paper No 6404).

Both the Yali and the Captain of the Turkish ship were re called whilst Colonel Talbot was on the coast, the former for bringing about the conflict with Jasim in which the Turkish troops had been defeated, the latter for having afterwards bom barded the town of El Bidaa. As a result of Colonel Talbot 's interviews with j n( ii a Office Jasim and his brother Ahmed, the India Office Ma y 12 ' 1893 * recommended that negotiations should be entered into with the Porte for the withdrawal of the Turkish establishments on compensation from the local Chiefs guaranteed by the Government of India.

IN cgotiations with the Sultan for the surrender ludia Office, of his sovereign claims were obviously im- June 14 ' 18 ' 93 - practicable, but the interests of the El Katr pearl fisheries and the Bahrein trade depend on a durable settlement with Sheikh Jasim. Instructions were therefore sent to the Govern.!

Notice was therefore given to the Porte, as had frequently been done before, that Bahrein being under British protection Her Majesty's Government could not admit of any interference by Turkish authorities with the natives of that island. The Porte endeavoured to show that we had disclaimed any right in regard to Bahrein. It was therefore reminded of the former communi cations from Her Majesty's Government, which had been consistent and undoubted in refusino- to recognize the sovereignty of the Sultan, and of the assurance given by Aali Pasha in 1871 that the Sublime Porte entertained no inten tion whatever of obtaining supremacy over the island. Fao Fort. It was reported from Bussorah in July that work under Engineer officers was being resumed at Pao Port, and that £ T. 800 had been sanctioned for the erection of three military guard posts on the River Shat-el-Arab. Sir A. Nicolson renewed to the Turkish Minister for Poreign Affairs the previous remon strances and warnings, viz., that the fort would be a menace to British commerce, and that, should it be completed and steps be taken to arm it, Her Majesty's Government would regard that action as one of hostile preparation which they would be entitled to resent, and which would justify them in taking the necessary measures to counteract such proceedings. Said Pasha told Sir A. Nicolson privately that the fort was built in order to put money into the pockets of the Ministry of War, and that he himself was opposed to the expenditure. As in September the work on the fort was said to be still going on, Sir A. Nicolson made representations to the Grand Yizier, who replied that the matter was entirely in the hands of the Minister for War, to whom he would speak on the subject. The Commander-in-chief on the East Indies Station has been instructed to send a ship to ascertain the exact nature of the work in progress. P. BEHTIE.
