The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.Related matters covered in the correspondence include the following: the Sultan's initial request for the services of Dr Govind Balakrishna Yamkanmardi (spelling varies throughout the file), a former Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Muscat Hospital, now returned to India; the Political Resident's reluctance to approve the request, on the grounds of Yamkanmardi's apparent 'gross subordination' while previously employed in Muscat; a later request from the Sultan for the services of another Sub-Assistant Surgeon named Dr P B Desai; Dr Desai's unwillingness to take up the post in Muscat, on account of his wife's illness; Dr Yamkanmardi's acceptance of the post, via direct correspondence with the Sultan.The Arabic language material consists of correspondence between the Political Agent and the Sultan. There is no material covering the period 1939-1942.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Doctors</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Recruitment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e1#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e1#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
