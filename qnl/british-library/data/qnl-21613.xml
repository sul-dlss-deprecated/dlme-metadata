HANDBOOK OF HEJAZ Prepared by the Arab Bureau, Cairo. SECOND EDITION, FEBRUARY 26, 1917. CAIRO. Government Press. 1917.PREFATORY NOTE. The first edition of this Handbook was compiled by Lieut. Commander D. G. Hogarth, R.N.V.R., partly from informa tion collected by the Admiralty War Staff, Intelligence Division, for the Handbook of Arabia, partly from other (including native) sources. It was then thought best to issue it at once, without waiting for the results of the political change in progress in Hejaz. The development of events since June 1916, however, has improved our knowledge of many physical features, as well as altered the social con ditions, of Hejaz. The first edition, therefore, which contained errors due to haste, has been recast by the hands responsible for its original appearance; and the second edition, now issued, is based, in considerably greater measure, on the evidence of persons who have actually visited the locality, and been in contact with its society. Much, however, in and about Hejaz, remains uncertain or unknown, and the present edition is only less provisional than its predecessor.PiGl HANDBOOK OF HEJAZ. I.—AREA. When it was a vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, ' Hejaz' meant the north-western littoral province of Arabia, from the head of the Gulf of Akaba to a point between Lith and Qunfudah, about half-way down the east Red Sea coast, i .e. from 30° north latitude to 20°. Its inland boundary was not defined, being dependent on the distance to which the Turkish power had been able to make itself felt, at different periods, in the direction of Jebel Shammar and Nejd. Under the Ottoman theoretic arrangement, both these latter districts were included in the vilayet of Basra, and Hejaz was understood to be bounded by a line drawn vertically from north to south through the desert and steppe east of Teima. But really the limit of effective Turkish authority, and therefore of the vilayet of Hejaz, was never pushed east of the Kheibar Oasis. The province measured, therefore, about 700 miles from north to south by some 250 miles west to east (175,000 square miles). The term Hejaz,' however, in strict Arab usage, especially when the Holy Land is thought of. is not applied so widely, the northern limit being a line drawn inland from the Red Sea coast, just south of Wejh to El- ! Ala and across the steppe-desert to the northernmost point of the Harrat Kheibar, Midian and its hinterland (Hismah) being excluded. But, for the purpose of this Handbook, which is to include all the northern littoral on the east of the Red Sea, Hejaz will be understood in its wider signification as reaching from Akaba to lith and including Midian. Inland, however,it will not be considered to extend farther than a short distance east of the line of the Hejaz railway, prolonged in imagination to Mecca and Ta/if. This is, in fact, the inland limit of permanent continuous settled inhabitation. The rare oases lying eastward again, of which the principal are Teima and Kheibar, are not reckoned by their natives part of Hejaz.3 — short :t '. tlle II.—PHYSICAL CHARACTER. iatives 1. — R elief. Hejaz is the northern part of the uptilted edge of the Arabian continental shelf and consists, mainly, of its short and steep return westward, together with the narrow fringe of Red Sea littoral formed of detritus and coral at its foot; but we include in it also a strip of the main shelf itself, i.e. the uppermost level of the central Arabian steppe. Hejaz. therefore, falls naturally into three parallel zones : (I) Lowland littoral (Tihamah); (2) Mountainous acclivity ('Aqabah) up to and including the Gable Ridge; (3) Strip of declivity towards the steppe desert of Central Arabia. (1) The first of these zones, the Tihamah, is well-marked and of one general surface throughout, sandy, dusty, and coralline ; but it varies much in breadth, being very narrow in the northern part (Midian), and broadening to a twenty or thirty-mile dimension behind Yambo' and again south of Rabugh. (2) The second zone is more complicated, owing to denudation having acted variously on a slope, from 80 to 100 miles long, composed of different formations and rising to from 5,000 to 8,000 feet above sea-level. Harder rocks have been left upstanding in mountainous massifs on all parts of this slope, and, in places, lava-capped harmh, preserving all below it from denudation, maintains the original level of the shelf far westward, as well as eastward, of the Gable Ridge. One such seam of harder rock lies a little back from the sea along virtually the whole coastline, and, in Midian, where the rock is granitic, its summits stand up .from 7,000 to 9,000 feet, forming a Coastal Range higher in places than the— 4 — main Gable Ridge behind, and divided from the latter by a slightly lower tract (the Hismah), which is so little inclined as to be almost a plateau. Further south these upstanding masses are more widely spaced, as behind Yambo c , and, as the rocks become progressively of softer texture, the elevation falls, as we proceed south, to that of low hills. Nevertheless, some sort of Coastal Range can be traced down all the length of Hejaz to a junction with the higher Asir f Aqabah. Inland of this Coastal Range the zone continues to rise. It assumes a plateau character only in the north (Midian). South of Wadi Hamdh blocks of harrah begin to appear, and, below the latitude of Medina, impart a rugged mountainous character to the slope, indistinguishable from that of the main Gable Ridge to east. It is the existence of this interruption of the even decline, which has deflected to Rabugh, in the Tihamah, the projected continuation of the Hejaz railway. South of this mountainous intrusion, the region behind the Coastal Range (the latter less well- marked than elsewhere) has neither a distinct plateau nor a distinct valley character, but is a medley of foothills. In the presence of so much confusion and variety of relief, it serves no good purpose to subdivide this second zone (as in the first edition of this Handbook) into parallel belts — Coastal Range, Intramontane Uplands, and Gable Ridge — although, in fact, in some parts of Hejaz (as south of it, in Asir and Yemen) such a threefold distinction is obvious and helpful. (3) The third zone, the uppermost strip of the Central Arabian declivity, is likewise interrupted by great masses of harrah which buttress out the Gable Ridge eastwards, both north and south of Medina, to points beyond the inland limit here assigned to Hejaz. In these parts, it is more correct to sav that no third zone exists. Moreover, north of the Medina harrah region, the inland slope does not decline directly from the Gable Ridge, but has been f cooped out, on the east of the high Hismah and 'Aweiridh harrahs, into— ;&gt; -- a trough-like valley without outlet to the sea, and about 200 miles in length. This depression has been utilized to carry the Hejaz railway from Batn el-Ghul to Dar el-Hamra. At this last point a low pass (3,700 feet), between massifs of harrah, gives passage into the second zone. After that the railway has had little difficulty in reaching its present terminus by way of the valley and upper feeders of Wadi Hamdh, which itself passes close to Medina. A; has been explained above, however, the continuation of the railway in this zone is blocked by massifs offering no practicable passes due southward, and it must either go down to the Tihamah or repass into the third zone and circumvent the harrah projections of the Gable Ridge along the line of the inland Pilgrim Road which approaches Mecca from the north-east. The drainage channels originating on the Main Ridge which traverse the second zone are, in the north, all of the fiumara type, i.e. without permanent surface-flow. In Midian, where the elevation of all the slope is great, deep wadis follow one another in rapid succession, cutting up the country into a series of detached blocks, and forcing com munications from north to south to keep either close along shore (Egyptian Pilgrim Route) or far inland within th third zone (Syrian Pilgrim Route and Hejaz railway). Nor owing to their exceedingly steep gradients do they favour communication from west to east or create fertility. Midian, therefore, is a conspicuously ill-inhabited, un settled, and unknown district in a peninsula, to almost all parts of which these epithets apply in varying degrees. Such conditions continue until Wadi Hamdh has been passed. In the rest of Hejaz, where the general elevation is lower, while the gradients are more gentle and precipita tion is, on the whole, more regular, the wadis become more beneficent and often have some miles of perennial flow. Even the Wadi Hamdh, which debouches a few miles south of Wejh and unites two main channels from the 0Ridge, one draining the Kheibar harrah, the other the 'Aweiridh harrah, is useful in its upper basin, though uncultivated in its lower course. One of its feeders gives Medina its underground waters and extensive subur ban oasis; the other supplies the palm groves of el-'Ala.- Other wadis of considerable size debouch near Umlej, Yambo , Bureika, Rabugh, Jiddah, and Lith, and, in their middle courses, support a good deal of cultivation and con siderable hamlets. Most noteworthy m this respect are Wadis Yambo', Safrah, Fura, Leinuin, and Fatimah. The valleys of the southern wadis do not affect communi cations so adversely as in Midian. Many, indeed, facilitate communication from the coast, e.g. from Umlej to el-'Ala or Stab) 'Antar, from Yambo' to Medina, from Rabugh to Medina, and from Rabugh and Jiddah to Mecca. Hie principal superficial characteristic of FTejaz is general barrenness, relieved m the first and second zones by rare oases. 1 he littoral, except near wadi mouths, is throughout dusty sand and coralline rock ; the hills of the second zone are of dusty surface where not harrah or naked rock, and only at the bottoms of valleys is there rare fertility. The third zone is stony steppe, softening in the north to sheer nefud. 2.— C limate. • ^ needs , therefore, to be stated, that precipitation is insufficient throughout Hejaz. The Midian highlands get a little more than the Egyptian Delta ; the rest of Heiaz more than Middle Egypt, but not much more. Except at Ta if, in the extreme south, there are no sufficient seasonal* rams as in Asir and Yemen. On the Ridge and the upper parts of the seaward slope (including Mecca) precipitation occurs, both in winter, and occasionally in summer, during bnef thunderstorms, and water flows down the surface of Hejaz jiumaras at very rare intervals, though some times m great volume for a day or two. At Jiddah and inthe Tihamah generally the summer storms are much rarer, and the precipitation is altogether less. The climate of the Hejaz lowland is little better than that of the Yemen Tihamah, the mean annual temperature being over 80° and the air damp. Mecca, owing to its low eleva tion (700 to 850 feet) and its background of naked slopes, is worst off, and is an undesirable summer residence, being, on a still day, like a furnace; but Medina, with a mean tem perature of little over 70°, is healthy throughout the year. Ta'if is the most salubrious of the Hejaz towns ; it shares the keen dry air which purifies all the central steppe-lands, except in spots where water is over-abundant near the surface, as at Kheibar. The latter oasis, like Mecca and the coastal settlements, suffers from intermittent fevers, and Mecca itself has a bad name also for dysenteric and other epidemic diseases. The highlands behind Mecca and about Ta'if know occasional frost during even summer nights, and men cannot sleep in the open, in July and August, except under thick covering. 0III.—POPULATION. The native population, settled and unsettled (some of the latter being at one season in the province, at another out of it on the east), may be guessed at rather under than over a million. Only about one-sixth is either urban or ' on the land,' five-sixths being Beduins, wholly or partly nomadic, who, under ordinary circumstances, are poverty- stricken and therefore predatory. (1) Oasis Life is that of simple and primitive agricul turists. The clay-built houses are often spacious, with an upper floor, and the windows are open casements for light and air. The flooring is of beaten earth ; the doors are rudely constructed of palm-boards. Rafters are made of tamarisk and palm-beams ; for in all the oases tamarisk is largely grown. Palm-wood is used for cooking, but charcoal is burned in the Nejd manner in the coffee-fires, the • men making it in the desert. Twisted rope is manufactured from palm-fibre; but the villagers are chiefly occupied with the tending of their palm-groves and with cultivation. The Hejazis are barren of invention and imitation. Water is their main concern ; but they continue to use old wells, long ago hopelessly fouled, rather than sink new ones. In most of the oases there is a trade in mutton, goat-flesh, and daily provisions. But there are few bazaars, for every one is a merchant of his own produce in his own house. (2) Urban Life cannot be summarized usefully under any series of generalizations, the towns being either cosmo politan centres, as Mecca and Medina, whose societies are not typical of local life, or ports like Jiddah and Yambo*, of mixed population varying greatly from month to month according to the ebb and flow of pilgrims. Ta { if, again, as an official summer resort, stands by itself. Urban life^9 — 0 therefore, will be best treated in the next section under each separate town. (3) Beduin Life has certain common features which distinguish it to some extent from that of the nomadic societies elsewhere in Arabia. While, on the one hand, outside the towns, nomadism is paramount throughout Hejaz, there being few considerable villages or even hamlets, the towns, on the other hand, owing to their external rela tions, remain mo;e independent of the unsettled conditions round them than in any other area where nomadism pre vails to anything like the same degree. The result is that the sharpest contrast exists between urban and rural life in Hejaz. The townsmen are among the best off, the Beduins among the worst off, in Arabia. Thanks to their detach ment from the settled communities, and to the poverty of the soil, the Hejaz Beduins are exceptionally unproductive and uncommercial ; and further, owing to the temptation offered by the pilgrim traffic and also to the check on their natural free development, so long imposed by the con dominium of the Porte and the Emir, they are of exception ally predatory character, low morale, and disunited organiza tion. Though there are very large tribes, such as the Harb and 'Ateibah, there are no chiefs, except the King himself, exercizing any such paramount authority as is vested, e.g. in the great 'Anezah Sheikhs ; and the tribes act less as units than anywhere else, sub-sections considering themselves free to go their own ways. In sum, while the nomads are individually less to be trusted in Hejaz than in almost anv other Arabian province, engagements made on behalf of groups and safe conducts given, in all sincerity, by their Sheikhs, have less validity and less local range. Details of the several Hejaz tribes are given later in Section V. The principal units and their diras are, sum marily, as follows In the extreme north are the Huweitat (also N.E. outside the Hejaz limits) and the Beni ? Atiyah, closely allied.— 10 — sharing each other's diras, and ranging all Midian, as well as ' Petraea ' from Ma'an down to Dar el-Hamra on the Hejaz railway. The former spread down the coast of the Akaba Gulf and south as far as Dhabah; the latter range chiefly inland, on the Hismah and northward. The Huweitat are, probably, more numerous. The southern limit of the 'Atiyah is the upland Jau plain, through which runs the Wejh-Tebuk track. Some small Sinaitic clans also enter Midian from the north-west; the Sherarat impinge on it to some extent from north-east, and small groups of Huteim camp in it; but properly, it is 'Atiyah country. Immediately south of Midian range the Moahib, a very small tribe, and the Billi. The former are inland, in the southern 'Aweiridh harrah country, north of Meda'in Salih and el-'Ala; the latter range from the coast north of, and about, Wejh, where their paramount chief resides, up to within a few miles of the Hejaz railway (Meda'in Salih to Hadiyah) where the Aida and Fuqara (southern 'Anezah) begin. The Billi appear to be more numerous than was formerly supposed. They are more united than most other tribes. Next in order on the coast come the Juheinah, a large and numerous tribe which includes more settled and half-settled elements, and therefore has shown more sub servience to Ottoman authority than most Hejaz tribes. Its paramount chief lives at or near Yambo'. It contains a considerable sherifial (ashraf) element, and its chief is a sherif. As iu the case of the Billi, the rights of the Juheinah extend up to the Hejaz railway (Hadiyah to near Medina), but are often violated by their perpetual enemies, the Harb and the Fuqara (Fejr). The Harb, the first to be encountered of the greatest western tribes, hold the whole central part of Hejaz, and one section, the Zobeid, not only occupies the coast from \ambo' to Serom below Jiddah, but reappears in strength further south, below Lith. The main body of the Harb {Beni Sdlim, Masruh , Beni 'Arnr, and ( Auf sections) lies— 11 — right across the province, from the Yarabo'-Jiddah littoral to the easternmost Medina-Mecca road, and extends beyond Hejaz iTito North Central Arabia. As a whole, the Harb count for more in Hejaz than all other tribes put together; but they are very far from unified, the greater sub-sections, like the Ahamda or Hawazim or Subh, going often counter to the rest and even to their own chiefs. The whole tribe, at present, admits the paramount authority of the King of Hejaz. The other great tribe of the Central West, the ; Ateibah, normally enemies of the Harb but at peace with them at present, hardly enters into our present consideration, since its proper dira lies almost wholly east of the Medina-Mecca- Ta'if line, which we have taken as our inland limit; and, under ordinary circumstances, it has more to do with Qasim and the west Nejdean steppe than with Hejaz. But at least one of its main sections, the Ruqah, cannot be left altogether out of account, since it not only supplies part of the population of Ta'if , but is attached politically to the King of Hejaz. So also, though less closely, is the other main section, the Berqah. Besides these there are three lesser ones. In and about Mecca itself are found fifteen out of the twenty-one small Ashraf clans, which trace descent from Hasan, the Prophet's grandson. Two of these, the Dhawi Surur and the Shenabrah, are nomadic, ranging south of Mecca, while two more, the Dhawi Barakat and Dhawi Hasan, are now regular tribes, just outside Hejaz in North-west Asir. South of the Harb limit Hejaz is parcelled out among several minor tribes, of which the Juhadlah, who occupy the coast from Serom to near Lith, are, by a good deal the most important. Their centre is Sa'diyah, about a day's march inland, and they range north almost up to the Jiddah-Mecca road and east nearly to Jebel Qora. Inland of them lie first a very small nomad tribe, the Beni Fa- ham, then the Hudheil on and about the Mecca-TV ifroad; and to the south of these the Beni Thaqif in and south of Ta'if itself. Below the last again, toward the Asir boundary, range the Beni Nasri, Beni Sa'd, and Beni Malik (roughly in that order from east to west). The small A1 Mahdi tribe of fishermen divides all these from IJth, and from the northernmost of the Asir Tihamah tribes (Dhawi Hasan and southern Zobeid Harb).— 13 — 1 lf in and jward tie and ^ west), all these Hamali irb). IV.—DISTRICTS AND TOWNS. 1.— N orthern D istrict. For convenience, all the northern part of our area, from north latitude 30° to north latitude 26°, will be considered under the name 'Midian,' which is still in native use (Jebel Madyan), though applied to the north-western coast-land only. Midian proper is a desert district throughout, with no permanent settlements at all between the less than half- dozen hamlets on the coast and the line of the Hejaz railway, whose stations, along the stretch from Ma'an to Dar el- Hamra (about 250 miles), have no village or hamlet attached to them except in the single case of Tebuk, a village of some 250 inhabitants in a small oasis. {See Routes Nos. 3 and 12.) The coast is fringed by a low sandy Tihamah plain, vary ing from about fifteen miles to less than half in breadth. It has vegetation only in the mouths of wadis, but has been provided with wells at intervals for the use of pilgrims on the Egyptian Hajj road (Route No. 2). The only settlements of even village rank are as follows ;— Akaba lies within an extensive date-grove, with ample, but brackish, water supply (the best is obtained near the beach), on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Akaba, near its head, which forms a circular bay extending for some three miles to the north and north-west of the village. The shore is very low at the head of the bay, where de bouches the Wadi el-'Arabah, a broad sandy valley bounded on each side by high escarpments. Near the mud-built village, which has about 800 permanent inhabitants but no suq, is a small square fort, in which a Turkish detachment used to be stationed. Close to the west of thefort, a small jetty has been constructed. There are lar^e palm-gardens, and the remains of a high embankment above the village, probably to deflect flood water. The remains on Fara'un Island off the west coast of the bay are ISaracemc. Muweilah, is a village and large fort about 150 miles south of Akaba, containing a small grain-depot for pilgrims and a Beduin (Huweitat and c Atiyah) market. The village consists of some seventy or eighty families, most of them c welling in palm-leaf huts; there are a few stone houses, and some gardens and date-groves. The water supply is from s allow wells, and is abundant but not always good. Sheep are obtainable, and charcoal is extensively burnt from acacia trees m the neighbourhood. A small Turkish garrison used to hold the place. The coast ig low, but gradually rises inland to hills of great height. There is no harbour, but merely a roadstead behind coral reefs, where a vessel might anchor in light winds ; but the approaches are dangerous Good shelter may be obtained at Sherm Yuhar, an inlet about wl 68 S0llth - Tliere is a caravan track from Muweilah to Tebuk. {See Route No. 3.) Dhabah (pron.: Dhubbah), south of Muweilah, is the headquarters of the local Huweitat chief. It is a wretched hamlet, but was chosen by the Turks in 1915-1916 as the base of their coastal defence troops. It has wells and groves. -i-i, se tolements such as another Dhabah, half-wav down he shore of the Akaba Gulf, and Salmah, south of Muweilah are mere blockhouses near which Beduins occasionally camp! he description of the Egyptian Pilgrim Road (Route JNa 2) will give a sufficient general idea of the Midianite linamah. Behmd this narrow coastal plain of the Gulf of Akaba the land rises steeply to moderate heights, falling again to a more gently rising plateau over which the Pilgrim— 15 — track runs south, avoiding the shore till past the opening of the Red Sea. Then it has to come down to the coast, for the land rises suddenly into a series of granitic peaks, from 7,000 to 9,000 feet in height, behind which, at an elevation of about 6,000 feet extends a plateau presenting a continuous escarpment to west at an average distance of forty miles inland. The valleys descending from this escarpment between the coastal peaks, and also those from the peaks themselves, are all sand-choked fiumaras, with none but very scanty desert vegetation. The plateau behind the escarpment is a vast plain of red sand with isolated outcrops of rock and is known generally as Hismah. It is about fifty miles broad, and, on south and east, is enclosed by rugged barren ground capped with lavas, whose peaks are about 1,500 feet higher. When this barrier, the northernmost part of the main Gable Eidge of Hejaz, is passed, there is a steep fall eastward to the long trough like depression described above (p. 5) along which the Hejaz railway is laid at a distance of about 100 miles from the Midian coast. Beyond this depression is hard dusty desert, often strewn with basaltic detritus, reaching to the western flank of the Nefud. Route No. 3, from Muweilahto Tebuk, passes through country typical of Midian. The littoral as far south as Wadi Hamdh was regarded as Egyptian territory under Ottoman suzerainty until 1886. South of Wadi Hamdh, the district which lies between the coast-line and the Hejaz railway (here about 130 miles inland) is ill-known to us, and the Wadi Hamdh itself, which enters the sea by several months, has never been described by any explorer. It can only be said that the coastal plain and range of Midian are continued, the former becoming, if anything, more barren, and the latter declining in elevation, but remaining abrupt. Wadi Hamdh itself cuts through the coastal range, coming from the ! Aweiridh Jiarrah on the one hand and the Kheibar harrah on the other {see p. 6). If we may judge by the experience of travellers on the main caravan-tracks which cross this district, from W ejh to el- Ala,— 16 — the coastal range (or ghat) is backed by a rougher but less elevated tract than in Midian, and this contains some scat tered hamlets of the Billi tribe; but there is practically nothing worthy to be called a village between the Tihamah and the Hej az railway. There are five fairly easy passes leading from the coast to the railway, of which three, those A 6 en -Neid, and Kharar, lead up in this district The other two, Murabba (in Wadi 'Ais) and Bowat, are in the Central District. For the Tihamah, Route No. 2. The principal, and about the only permanent settlement in it, is : Wejh, a small town, including a few stone houses, on the north side of the bay of the same name ; population about ' ' undred yards east of the town is a square fort on a flat-topped hill The bazaar is poorly stocked, but some forage is procurable. Water is scarce, brackish, and mostly from cisterns, but some is obtained from a well some thirty feet deep, about 1,000 yards to the east of the fort. coast m the neighbourhood consists of coral cliffs from fifty to seventy feet high, and between these and the hills, which rise steeply three or four miles inland, is a low plain marshy near the sea and covered with sahne incrustation. The harbour is of easy access and no dangers bar its approach. The fort makes a good mark for a ship entering, as does also a tower, fifty feet high on the south side of the bay. About six miles east of VVejh is a fort, nearly surrounded by hills; it serves as a gram-depot for the use of caravans going to Mecca. Weih was wrecked by the Arabs on January 23, 1917, and will not recover for some time. The fort is largely in ruins. settlement^ 6 lme ^ ^ He ^ az railwa 7 is one important El- f Ala, a large oasis village of about 4,000 inhabitants at the northern limit of religious Hejaz. It lies on the south-west side of Wadi el-Qora, under the steep cliff2 — 17 — of the Harrat el-' Aweiridh. The railway follows the Pilgrim Route to the east of the wadi and the station is at some distance from the town. The town itself is narrow and about a third of a mile in length, but the cultivated oasis extends above and below it to a total length of two miles and right across the wadi. It is walled on the south-west side where it joins the desert, and there are two main gates besides smaller doors ; it is open on the side of the oasis. The houses are well constructed of stone, but the streets are narrow and darkened by the upper storeys which are built high to gain some freshness in the stagnant air of the wadi, shut off as it is by the harrah from the western sea-winds. There is no open bazaar, but daily provisions are sold after sunrise at the street corners. Butchers sell mutton and goat-flesh outside the walls ; the streets are kept very clean. The date plantations and fields are irrigated by a luke warm brook and by some smaller springs which rise in the oasis. All the surface water is tepid, laxative, and sulphur ous, the temperature of the main stream being 92° F. ; in it the villagers wash themselves, and there are enclosed bathing-places for the women. The women go closely veiled. Where the valley begins to shelve the fields are dug out deeply, below the level of the public paths, for direct irrigation ; the outlying palms beyond the level of the springs are watered from well-pits dug to a depth of twenty- seven feet. The ground-water, which is cool and brackish, is drawn up to the surface by small humped cattle. El-'Ala is a great source of date-supply for the north western nomads, and there is a certain amount of traffic in com and imported rice. Of the many kinds of dates, the helw variety is chiefly exported to Syria. There are groves of sweet and sour lemons, but the plum is the only stone- fruit. There are not many vines, and these climb on trees and trellises. Besides the humped cattle employed for field labour, there are a few asses and goats and some poultry. A— 18 — 2.—Central District. Ihis district extends from about north latitude 26°^ to north latitude 23°. The Tihamah after some distance south of Wadi Hamdh — until in fact the foot-hills of Jebel Hadhwah have been rounded — remains very narrow, sandy and desolate, and south of TJmlej it becomes little more than a sandy beach. Indeed, throughout the district, except for the town of Yambo', it is even more deserted than in Midian. But from the southern flank of Jebel Radhwah onwards it broadens greatly, and behind Yambo' is a wide sandy plain, stretching back some twenty miles. South of this point it narrows again, but never to the same small dimensions as farther north ; and, with the outflow of several large wadis between ^ ambo' and Rabugh, it takes on an intermittently deltaic character, supporting a good deal of rank vegetation. The coastal range declines somewhat in altitude from Jebel Radhwah, through Jebel Subh, to Jebel Rahab, until, in the southern district, south of the Pilgrim Route (Darb es-Sultani) from Rabugh to Medina, it will become dusty hills not above 2,000 feet in altitude. Jebel Radhwah itself is a very imposing massif, the finest perhaps on the Hejaz coast, its serrated crests rising to 7,000 feet. Jebel Subh is also a striking group which, owing to the hardness of its composition, presents abrupt scarps and fantastic pinnacles. Both massifs are iron-bound and very waterless, the rain finding no lodgment and running off into the wadis below. Behind them the general slope ascends, in the northern part, fairly regularly, despite a surface accidented with hills and patches of harrah, to the Gable Ridge which here lies from 150 to 100 miles inland. The result of so long a slope is a succession of wadis with much larger and more important basins than exist in Midian. The northernmost, W adi Hamdh, is the largest, its main channel— is) — having a course of some 250 miles from the Kheibar harrah to the sea ; it is said to carry no perennial surface-water in its lower course after its confluence with its 'Aweiridh tributary, some eighty miles below Medina ; but the thick jungle observed near its mouth demonstrates the presence of ground-water, and it contains wells all along its course. Its general direction is at first west, then north-west, then west again ; its most important left bank tributary, Wadi ? Ais,. flows north of east. The valley of the latter is ill- known, but is reported to be more fertile than that of Wadi Hamdh, and to support, in a number of small oases, a considerable population of settled Juheinah of the Musa section. The great mass of Jebel Hadhwah then intervenes and diverts the next main valley, that of Wadi Yainbo', considerably south of west; but the great catchment area, which Radhwah provides, causes the middle part of this valley to be much richer than any yet encountered. A long chain of settled palm-oases, known generally as Nakhl el-Yambo', stretches for twenty miles along its course, and some intermittent fertility is reported to continue still farther towards the head of the wadi, which lies not very far west of Medina. The deflection of the main valleys is accentuated south of Wadi Y^mbo' by the iron mass of Jebels Figra and Subh, and the Wadis Safrah, Milif, Gaha, and Fura, the next important valleys in order, have a direction more southerly than westerly. All, and especially the first, repeat the fertility of Wadi Yambo' in their lower middle courses, but, like the latter, end in barren deltas choked with the pulverized detritus they themselves have brought down. Wadi Safrah carries a series of Harb (Beni Salim) settlements, which begin with Bedr Honein, famous in the history of the Prophet, and almost of urban rank, and run up to Hamra and beyond, a stretch of some twenty-five miles. The oases in the other wadis are more widely spaced ; but there is a group of considerable settlements with large groves, in Wadi Fura, where its valley opens out into a spacious ellipse round Modhiq, about sixty miles above its mouth. ©South of Wadi Fura occurs a feature, as yet very ill-known, but constituting apparently an interruption of the normal slope of the littoral. This is the projection of a mass of lava-capped rocks far to westward of the Gable Ridge of the main continental shelf. This great intruded mass of iron-bound highland cuts Hejaz almost into two parts, between which there is no easy passage at all except through the littoral near Rabugh, or far inland in the third zone, and only very short and unimportant wadis originate on the seaward flank of it. With this projection the Central District ends ; and its fan-like spread north of this point towards Medina accounts for the blank in our maps and our knowledge of much of the eastern part of that district. The chief settlements in the Central District are two on the coast, Umlej and Yambo 5 ; large villages in Wadia Yambo', Safrah, and Fura, such as Bedr Honein, Wasta, or Modhiq; and Medina in the inner country. Umlej, a village of some eighty houses with fort, mosque, and small garrison, lies on a deep bay opening to north-north-west opposite Hasani Island. There is a consi derable, if thin, date-grove in the wadi about one mile north of the village, and others exist in the neighbourhood. Umlej has grown in the last few years, owing to the facilities of its bay for coasting craft, the existence of fairly easy tracks to Istabl 'Antar station on the Hejaz railway (120 miles) or to Medina direct (140 miles), and the comparative fertility of the Tihamah hereabouts. It lies near, but south of, the frontier between Billi and Juheinah territories. Although faced by a dangerous reef, it should develop further in the near future. Yambo' el-Bahr is built on the edge of a barren plain between the mountains and the sea, and walled on the landward side. It stands on the north shore of a bay, protected by a small sandy island on a reef which forms the southern limit of the anchorage, and is used as the port of Medina (130 miles). The entrance to the inlet is oneand a half cables wide between the reefs. The water is deep outside, but in the entrance the depth? decrease rapidly from fifteen to eight and six fathoms. The quay is about 100 yards long, built of limestone blocks, and has a maximum depth of about six feet of water alongside, shoaling to three feet at the western end. Off the town the anchorage is in from four to six fathoms, and the width available is one and a quarter cables. The houses of the town are roughly built of limestone and coralline, and the crumbling of the latter material gives them a dilapidated appearance. It used to be a town of 4,000 or 5,000 people; but since the opening of the Hejaz railway the place has decayed, and more than half the houses are in ruins. It is now a mean and very dirty place; but there are shops where a few necessaries are obtainable. The permanent population is about 1,500; but caravans, especially in the pilgrimage season, swell it temporarily. Pilgrims, who arrive by sea, store their goods if they are too heavy to be transported. Non-Moslems are allowed to reside within the town, provided they do not go outside the walls. Water is brought from wells, three miles east, on camel- back, and from others (brackish) in the town; also from rain-cisterns. It is nowhere good. A condensing plant, recently put up, can make thirty tons per twenty-four hours. The place lies in Juheinah territory. For Bedr Honein and the larger villages see Route No. 9. Medina is a walled town in a large oasis, 130 miles inland from YamlV, and the present terminus of the Hejaz rail way. It lies in a hollow on an elevated plain, at an altitude of 2,500 feet. Hills surround the plain on three sides, at a distance of five to ten miles from the town ; but the country is more open towards the south. The convergence of wadis in the neighbourhood of Medina has made it one of the best watered districts in Hejaz. The city, which is about half the size of Mecca, forms an irregular oval, and is about a mile in .length. It consistsof two parts. The older town, in the north-east quarter, is surrounded by its own wall, and is separated by a broad open space, the Barr el-Munakhah, and on the south side by the narrower Darb el-Jenazah, from the modern town and suburbs, which are protected by a rampart of mud and crude brick joining the wall of the older town at its north west and south-east extremities. Through the modern town runs the Wadi Buthan, a tributary of the Wadi Qanat, which the road from Yambo' crosses. A fort or small citadel shuts in the head of the Barr el-Munakhah on the north side. There are five outer gates, the Bab esh-Shami and the Bab ez-Ziyafah on the north, the former leading to Jebel Ohod and the tomb and mosque of the Prophet's uncle, Hamzah (about four miles from the town) ; in the east wall is the Bab el-Jumah, which opens on the Nejd road, and Baki 5 el-Gharqad, the cemetery in which are the tombs of many of the companions of the Prophet; on the south east is the Bab Kubah, opening on to the Kubah road, and on the west is the Bab el-Ambari, through which runs the road to Yambo'. The east and west gates are massive buildings with double towers. The main bar racks are outside the Kubah gate. The railway station lies about a quarter of a mile to the west of the town, and includes some substantial bullet-proof buildings. 'Pilgrims arriving by rail, or from Yambo c , enter the town by the west gate and cross the suburbs to the Barr el- Munakhah, the great open space, already referred to, where caravans assemble on arrival and before startino-; here those o ' who cannot afford to hire houses encamp in the open. The older town is entered from the Barr el-Munakhah by the Bab el-Misr, from which the principal street runs eastward to the Haram or Prophet's Mosque, which is entered at the principal gate (Bab es-Salam) in the south-west corner, richly decorated with marbles, tiles, and gilded inscriptions ; but the spacious court of the mosque, with its minarets, lofty main dome, and many lesser domes, is hemmed in on all sides by narrow lanes and houses.— 23 — Within the principal gate a portico leads along the south wall to the chamber, hung with curtains, which is sup posed to contain the graves of Mohammed, Abu Bekr, and ' Omar; the reputed tomb of Fatimah is in a chamber to the north of this. Within the court of the mosque are the Prophet's well and some palms said to have been planted by Fatimah. The houses of the town are substan tially built of granite and lava blocks cemented with lime; some of those in the better residential quarters are four or five storeys high and have small gardens behind them. The streets are narrow and dark, but comparatively clean and, in part, paved. Unlike Mecca, Medina has always been a city of agricul turists. It is surrounded on all sides except the west by date plantations and cultivated fields, which extend for several miles. A copious supply of water is conducted from a tepid source (Ez-Zarkah) at the village of Kubah (two miles to the south-east), and is distributed by underground conduits to each quarter. Good water is also obtained from many wells in the oasis, the underground water being within easy reach at almost any point. Some of the wells are brackish, and the soil in places is impregnated with salt. The date-palm grows luxuriantly ; no less than 139 varieties are said to be cultivated, of which sixty or seventy are well known. The best class is exported. Vines also flourish, the best variety {sherifi) having a long white grape ; the fruit-trees include jujube trees ; bananas, limes, some peach trees, three sorts of pomegranates, but no apricots. Maize is largely grown ; and, in smaller quantities, wheat and barley, some Egyptian clover (bersirn), and a large assort ment of vegetables are cultivated. The permanent population, apart from the garrison, is about 30,000, living mainly on the pilgrimage, on the revenues of the mosque, and on a large Government grant (surra). The suburban inhabitants, especially the Beni 'Ali of 'Alawi, profess Shiah opinions more or less openly and tend to marry among themselves. In this respect they 0form a contrast to the motley population of the city, which, through intermarriage with Turks, Kurds, Persians, and other races, is Arab only in language and customs. Further admixture has taken place through new settlers, who have remained behind after each pilgrimage, attracted by the profits to be gained as guides and by the Turkish subsidy. All classes in the town, from the owners of houses to the water-carriers, make large profits out of the pilgrimage; for while a visit to Medina is not compulsorv (like the pilgrimage to Mecca), those make it who can afford the luxury {see Section VIII); thus the annual influx of pilgrims, though much below that of Mecca, is still very considerable. The Harb tribe holds all the vicinity of Medina, and the Beni Ali clan is most to be reckoned with in and near the town itseif, where it is a constant source of trouble to the Turks and disorder among the citizens. 3.—Southern District. I his district lies, more or less, between parallels of north latitude 23° and 20°. Beginning just north of Eabugh, it ends just south of Lith. The Tihamah maintains the mixed character—desert and delta—which it assumed south of Yambo 5 , and is of very uniform surface and breadth (from ten to fifteen miles) throughout. It shows three parallel zones: (1) coralline sandy shore; (2) harder sand with underlying basaltic rocks here and there protruding, and (3) brush-covered sand-hills. Between the wadis, it is very desolate, and even the deltas are not arable. The Coastal Range is not more than a ridge or line of hills which gradually decreases in altitude till between Jiddah and Mecca it is under 2,000 feet. South of this point, however, the Range becomes mountainous again, rising through Jebel Abu Shanq to Jebel Sa'diyah, which runs on into the high 'Aqabah of Asir. After a drop behind the Coastal Range the general upward slope is disturbed, in the northern part, by the— 25 — mountainous westward projection of the Main Shelf, which has been described in connection with the southern part of the Central District. But the southern flank of this mass, slanting south of east from Kabugh, sends down short wadis which support a succession of oasis-villages along the first part of the Mecca Road (Quliyah, Qadhimah, Khalis, Asfa'n). Thereafter the larger type of wadi, which exists north of the harrah mass, resumes in Wadi Fatimah, whose fertility is much the same as that of Wadi Safrah. It is, however, more open. There is a chain of small oases with farms down its course, fed by the abundant springs of its tributaries, the Wadis Leimun and Seil, north and north-east of Mecca {see Routes Nos. 10, 16, and 17). Mecca itself lies in the arid hills south of this wadi; but it is clear, from reports, that south of the Mecca- Jiddah Road, there are similar wadis with fertile middle courses. The Main Ridge increases in aridity as Mecca is ap proached. North of the latter town it is largely harrah. Beyond Jebel Qora, however, conditions improve, and Ta'if is one of the most luxuriant oases in Arabia. South of this, again, there is thin, but more or less continuous fertility in valleys, the beginning of the better conditions which distinguish the inland wadis of Asir. As far south as the Jiddah-Mecca Road and even beyond it, on the coast, the district is nowadays all Harb country, this tribe having pushed the f Ateibah eastward out of Wadi Fatimah, and long ago got rid of the Dhafir and certain small Ashraf clans, which used to range north and north-west of Mecca. South of the Harb frontier, however, there is no big tribe, but the country is parcelled out among the many small units enumerated on page 11. On the coast are three fairly considerable settlements. Rabugh is a group of four hamlets and extensive date- groves about four miles inland from the head of Sherm Rabugh. There are numerous wells of indifferent water.Sherm Habugh. is an mlet, about two miles long, affording excellent anchorage in from eight to twelve fathoms ; it is perfectly sheltered from all winds and easy of ingress and egress to sailing vessels during north-westerly winds. In the entrance are depths of from eighteen to twenty fathoms, and immediately outside no bottom at thirty fathoms. Rabugh is the headquarters of the Zobeid section of the Harb and, during the Pilgrimage, a main halting place with shelters and a temporary suq. Next in order comes Jiddah, a walled town on a well-sheltered natural harbour, almost exactly half-way down the Red Sea coast. The entrance, through three lines of reefs, is, however, difficult. It possesses quays, landing piers, and sheds along the sea-front and is the port of Mecca- (54 miles by road, and slightly under 50, crowfiy) and Ta'if, and the main avenue of pilgrim access to Hejaz from the sea. Steamers, however, cannot approach within several hundred yards, and cargo must be discharged into dhows and lighters. The houses here, as at \ ambo , are largely built of coralline. There are forts at the seaward angles of the walls, and three main gates and three posterns (sea-face); elsewhere the wall is strengthened by smaller towers at intervals. The population is about 30,000, and includes a moiety of negroes and Somalis, most of whom live outside the walls, as well as some Indians, Greeks, and Jews ; about 300 British-Indian subjects are registered, but exact numbers of all families are not recorded. Non-Moslems are not allowed to go outside the walls. The normal Turkish garrison was a battalion with two field guns. The wells in the town are brackish ; but good water is brought from rain-cisterns, or from wells and springs seven miles away. The bazaar (southern quarter) is well supplied. A petro leum engine for a flour mill, turning out about eighteen hun dredweights of flour daily, was reported to have been set up and to be working in 1912; it is of British manufacture.A portable hospital, made of compressed paper and well equipped, was set up by the Turkish Government in 1911 outside the town for the accommodation of 100 pilgrims. The climate of Jiddah, though hot, is not unhealthy, the sea- breeze counteracting to some extent the insanitary condition of streets and houses ; but mortality is high, and bubonic plague to some extent probably endemic. Telegraph and telephone to Mecca ; cable to Suakim. There is nothing on the coast worthy the name of a village, or even a hamlet, for 125 miles south of Jiddah, until one comes to Lith, a village about one and half miles inland from the anchorage. The houses are of mud, and the place possesses a blockhouse, barracks, and a mosque ; water is obtainable as well as a few sheep and fowls. The anchorage is small but well protected by the reef, which extends nearly half a mile off the mosque, and by two reefs eastward of it ; the best entrance is apparently that close eastward of the mosque reef, where the depths are from four to six fathoms (mud). To the west of the inner anchorage is Agha islet, which is small, low, and sandy, and has on it several houses. The outer anchorage is from half to one mile south-south west of Agha islet, in from ten to fourteen fathoms (mud) ; but there is no shelter here from northerly or north-westerly winds. Inland lies the largest settlement of Arabia, Mecca, with its summer station, Ta'if, perhaps the pleasantest residence in the peninsula. Mecca, the chief town of Hejaz and the Holy City of Islam, lies in a deep narrow valley about fifty miles (crow- fly) inland from Jiddah. The valley runs up northwards with a slight easterly trend, and the hills on either side, rising several hundred feet, enclose it so completely that it was never thought necessary to encircle it with a forti fication. The ancient wall merely barred the threeentrances to the valley, where gates led into the town; but walls and gates have disappeared, the names of the latter only surviving, and the town is now quite open. The roads from Medina and from Jiddah join under Jebel Hindi, and enter the city by the west gate, the Bab el-Omrah (formerly known also as Bab ez-Zihir from a village of that name). The road from Yemen approaches up the main valley, and enters the Masfalah, or lower city, by the south gate. The road from the north gate, the Bab el-Ma'lah, leads from the upper quarter of the town to Munah and c Arafat. Considerable suburbs are built out to the north of the city, and just beyond the gate is the Ma'lah cemetery. Farther up the valley is the Beduin quarter, Ma'abdah, and the camp of the Egyptian pilgrims. The camp of the Syrian pilgrims lies to the north-west. On the south-west, below Jebel f Omar, is the other great cemetery, Shebeikah, and the camp of the Yemen pilgrims lies outside the south gate on the east side of the valley. The length of the town from the south gate to the northern suburbs is about two miles, and its greatest breadth, across the valley and up the western slopes, is about a mile and a third. The great mosque, the Beit Allah, containing the Ka'bah, lies in the lower part of the town, and its vast courtyard and colonnades break the line of the streets which run longitudinally up the valley. On three sides it is completely built in with houses, whose upper windows command a view of the courtyard and the Ka' bah. The Madrassah, adjoining the mosque on its north-west and south-west sides, and intended as lodgings for students and teachers of Mohammedan law and doctrine, has long been let out to wealthy pilgrims; lectures are now given between pilgrim seasons in the mosque itself, and a poorly furnished public library is maintained for the use of students. Immediately above the mosque a broad street, the Mas'ah, runs from south-east to north-west across the valley, and at either end of it are the sacred hills Safah and Merwah.This street forms the principal bazaar and centre of Meccan life ; the other chief bazaars are in smaller streets in the neighbourhood of the mosque. Many are roofed over as in Damascus and Baghdad, and there are some good shops. The houses of the town are all of stone, many of them well built and three or four storeys high, with terraced roofs and large projecting windows. The main streets are fairly wide and clean. The water supply is derived from springs at Jebel Arafat, the water being brought to Mecca by a conduit, which runs underground through the city. Here it is tapped at intervals by pits resembling wells ; the water is good (containing a large amount of chlorides), and is fairly abundant. The water-carriers form a special class ; they carry the water in skins and supply houses at a fixed rate per month according to the quantity required. The only well in Mecca is that of Zemzem, in the court of the mosque, ^ employed entirely for religious and medicinal purposes. Ihe special class of water-carriers and attendants, who dispense its water free, is supported by voluntary contributions. The well is about forty feet deep, and the water is unusually brackish and contaminated. It is regarded as a panacea for many bodily as well as spiritual ills, and used both for drinking and ablutions ; many pilgrims have it brought to their houses in order to wash themselves and their clothes in it; and a canister, containing a pint or so, is the most valued present that can be brought from Mecca. _ The soil of Mecca and its immediate neighbourhood is almost entirely barren. There are hardly any gardens, and all supplies are brought in from outside ; fruit and vegetables from Ta/if, rice and foreign products by sea to Jiddah ; poultry can be obtained at reasonable prices, and mutton, milk, and butter are plentifully supplied from the desert. Very little livestock is kept locally, except donkeys and camels. There are no local industries, and all classes of the popu lation live by the pilgrimage, acting as guides and directors— 80 — K during the sacred ceremonies, contractors for transport, and the like. Considerable sums are realized by the letting of houses, of which many more exist than the permanent popu lation requires. Besides the resident merchants, traders arrive from all parts of the Mohammedan world during the pilgrimage, and do a considerable business. The perma nent population, exclusive of soldiers, is about 70,000 (the largest urban aggregate in Arabia), including about 12,000 Indians. The annual pilgrimage brings normally at least 100,000 visitors into the town. The British Indian pilgrims sometimes number as many as 20,000, besides 4,000 or 5,000 British Malay pilgrims. The climate of Mecca is very hot and very drv, but not unhealthy. The town is so shut in by the surrounding hills that a breeze seldom reaches it, and the heat reflected from the rock-faces increases the glare by day and the closeness of the atmosphere at night. Rain falls rarely, but it is tropical in its violence, and does considerable damage to the town. On these occasions, during an inun dation (seil), the mosque is often flooded to a depth of several feet, since it lies lower than the surrounding city, whose level has been gradually raised by debris accumulated through the destruction and rebuilding of the houses. A former . attempt to mitigate the inundation by throwing a dam across the valley was not successful, and the flood-water is allowed to escape through the town and out into the open valley by the south gate. During the pilgrimage there is always peril of devastating epidemics, for the present sanitary system is useless, and the camps of the poorer pilgrims are crowded and most insanitary. Cholera is most dreaded ; the bubonic plague, though equally deadly, is not feared so much, owing to its comparatively slow rate of development and to the speedy dispersal of the pilgrims after the cere monies. There are three forts, the largest, Jiyad, on the south east, a smaller one to the west on a mound called Filfil, below Jebel Hindi, and Laalaa on the north oppositethe Imaret. The city is divided into thirteen quarters: on the east 3 Maabda, Sheib 'Amir, Suq el-Leil, Qushashryah, Jiyad, Masfalah ; on the west, Suleimaniyah, Naqa, Qarara, Shamiyah, Shobeikah; on the north, Haret el-Bab, Jarwal. The public buildings include a court house, post office, and other Government offices ; there are also baths, a hos pital, and hospices for poor pilgrims from India, Java, etc., three schools and ten Jcuttabs, and a public library. The royal residence in known as the Imaret. Slaves are still exposed for sale in certain Khans. The city receives from, rather than pays to, the Grovernment, as it did also in the time of the Turks. Military service is not obligatory, but there is a good deal of ' compulsory volunteering.' A petroleum engine for a flour mill, turning out about 1| tons of flour daily, was set up in 1909, and in January 1912 two others of the same size had been imported and were being set up ; they are all of British manufacture. Telegraph to Jiddah and Ta'if, and telephone to Jiddah. Ta/if is a walled town, situated in a sandy plain sur rounded by low hills, on the high plateau about seventy-five miles south-east of Mecca, at an elevation of about 5,000 feet. It is the summer residence of the King, his palace standing within the Bab es-Seil with an open space before it. The citadel is on the west side of the town. The houses are built of stone, the larger ones covered with plaster. The town is fully inhabited only in the summer months, when the more wealthy Meccans remove there from the capital. It is much cooler than Mecca, and has a plentiful water supply. Both in climate and physical character the dis trict resembles the highlands of Asir and Yemen, the monsoon or tropical rains, which are unknown elsewhere in Hejaz, falling heavily in the early autumn. Water is obtained from abundant springs and brooks, the principal stream, the Sell, being beautifully clear but lukewarm. Beyond the reach of the brooks irrigation is carried on from shallow pits, the water being drawn by small Arabianoxen. The inhabitants,, about 5,000, are in the main settled members of the Beni Thaqif and 'Ateibah tribes. They are principally occupied in tending fruit-trees and vines in the gardens some two miles to the south-west and north-east of the town, in spaces of fertile soil below the hills. In the fields at the end of a valley to the north east is a village, Wahhab. The vines, for which Ta'if is famous, do not lie loosely on the soil, but are bound to stakes. Apricot and pome granate trees bear abundantly; the pear has been intro duced from Egypt, and some olive trees from Syria. The palm does not thrive at Ta'if, where both the water and soil are sweet; but roses are extensively cultivated and their blossoms are transported to Mecca, where attar ( *atr) is distilled, the precious perfume which is carried by the pil grims throughout the Mohammedan world. The 'Ateibah Arabs supply the town with mutton, and a white curd cheese is brought in by the Qoreish. Fruit and vegetables from the gardens are sent in considerable quantities to Mecca and Jiddah.3 — 33 — V.—TRIBAL NOTES. In this section are given fuller particulars of the Hejaz tribes already enumerated in Section III. 1.—HU WEITAT. It is unnecessary to say more of the Huweitat than that only a small part of the tribe ranges permanently in any district of Hejaz. One clan, at present under Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Abu Toqeiqa (but rightfully under Shadli 'Alyan), is scattered along the littoral from Akaba to Na' man Island, its headquarters being at Muweilah and Dhabah. The great Huweitat Sheikhs remain outside Hejaz. This tribe is responsible for the Hejaz railway from the end of the Beni Sakhr stretch just south of Ma'an to a point south of QaFat el-Mudawwarah where the Beni 'Atiyah take over. (£) 2.—'ATIYAH (BENI), The Beni 'Atiyah are an old tribe closely akin to the 'Anezah. They claim descent from Ma'z, who is said to have been brother of 'Anaz, the ancestor of the 'Anezah. Some authorities state that the 'Atiyah tribe was the origin of the Huweitat, the Heiwat, the Terabin, Ma'za, and Tiyahah. Whether or no this be the true explanation of ^ the relation between the 'Atiyah and the Huweitat, it is certain that their connexion is exceedingly close. The two tribes camp in each others country, and aid each other against common enemies. The 'Atiyah occupy the northern half of the 'Aweiridh harrah, and are separated from the Moahib harrah by the hollow plain of the Jau, through which there is a road fromWejh to Tebuk. The Jau is reckoned to be the dividing line between the Ahl esh-Shimal and the Ahl Qibli, the northern and the southern Arabs. The 'Atiyah are held responsible for the Hejaz line from Dhat el-Hajj to Dar el- Hamra. The coast from Na/man Island up to the head of the Gulf of Akaba is in their hands in conjunction with the Huweitat, as well as the high barren hills between the harrah and the sea. Their rugged mountain district is unsuitable for camel-breeding. Their total strength is not known, but it is considerable—reported, indeed, not less than that of the Juheinah {q.v.). Of their sub-tribes, the Sidenyin and the Khutheirah inhabit the Harrat 'Aweiridh, the Sidenyin being at the northern end with the Subut to the west of them. The Ageilat used to be carriers of goods between Ma'an and Tebuk; but the railway must have taken some of their trade. The Ma c za, who range up to and even beyond Ma'an, are the boldest robbers. Other large sub-tribes are the Rubeili and Khamayiyah. The f Atiyah are stout in arms. Their foes are the Sham- mar and the Shammar allies, the Fuqara, and Wuld Sulei man. With the Fuqara, the 'Atiyah maintain an inextin guishable feud. They raid the Harb and the central clans of the Huteim. Their paramount chief is Selim Ibn Harb. 3.—MOAHIB. The plain of the Jau, running through the Harrat f Awei- ridh, is counted the frontier between the Ahl esh-Shimal and the Ahl Qibli, To the north lie the Beni 'Atiyah, to the south the Moahib, who, though they are of ' Anezah descent, being an offshoot of the Siba', are Billi by adoption. They inhabit the southern part of the 'Aweiridh, a rugged mass of volcanic rock upon a platform of sandstone. They are sheep-breeders, and are reduced to small numbers, though they were once powerful enough to drive the BeniSakhr from the 'Aweiridh. Scattered clans are to be found among their kinsmen, the Siba { , and with the Beni Sakhr in the Belqa. There is besides an ancient colony of Moahib husbandmen, keepers of cattle, in the Hasa. ' Their dim marches with the Hejaz line from a little above Qal'at el- Akhdar to Meda/in Salih ; in the west they go down to the country of the Sihamah, a clan of the Billi, and in summer the Sihamah come up with their flocks into the hanah. 4.—BILLI. The Billi, descended from Himyar and therefore Ahl Qibli, are an old tribe whose range extends from Na'man Island to Wadi Hamdh and inland up to the Hejaz railway, a short section of which, south of el-'Ala, the Billi 'are charged to guard. Part of the tribe cultivates land in the neighbourhood of Wejh and also inland, and carries rice and other commodities for the Wejh merchants to and from Medina and the Hejaz railway. It lives on friendly terms with the Juheinah, but at enmity with its inland neighbours, the Puqara and the Wuld Suleiman. Offshoots of the tribe are found in Sinai, and also in Upper Egypt at Baliana. The Billi in Hejaz number, probably, at least 40,000 souls, of which perhaps one-third are semi-settled. Their paramount chief, Suleiman Afnan Ibn Rufadah, resides, normally, at Wejh. There are two chief sections, the Khuzaim and the Makhalad. The former has some seven sub-sections, of which the Wabsah and A1 Asabsin (the chief's sub-section) are the most important. The latter section has at least five sub sections, the A1 Maqlat, A1 Sitamah, and Rumuth being all numerous. The tribe is poor, but well knit together and to its chief. The latter, who has the title Pasha, threw in his lot with the Turks till 1917, his tribe being unable otherwise to find food.— 30 — 5.—JUHEINAH. The Juheinah resemble closely the Billi, claiming the same descent, leading the same partly settled life, and having, in normal times, the same friends and enemies, and, on the whole, the same political sympathies. They are, however, more numerous, somewhat more warlike and more given to plundering, perhaps because the Yambo'- Medina roads offer them more tempting opportunities than the tracks from Wejh. Their range along this coast is from Wadi Hamdh to a little south of Yambo', and inland up to the Hejaz railway, between Hadiyah and Medina. Judged by its actual muster of nearly 9,000 fighting men in Feisal's army, the tribe (allowing for, say, twenty-five per cent men of military age not enlisted) numbers not less than 50,000 souls, and probably this figure is under the mark. Its paramount chief is Sherif Mohammed 'Ali Beidawi, who lives at Yambo'. The Sheikh of the Ghaneim sub-tribe has the dignity of Emir at Umlej ; at present the Emir is Mohammed Ibn Salih, but the local chieftainship is vested in his son, Sa'd, who is chief, in particular, of the Musa section. There are two main sections : (i) Malik, living in the Yambo' district and chiefly in the long valley of Wadi Yambo', which runs up almost to the Hejaz railway, and in the gorges of Jebel Radhwah. Here a succession of palm-groves are cultivated and inhabited by most of the settled Juheinah, including the Ashraf, who number some 2,500. This section, which is under Mohammed 'Ali Beidawi, has some eighteen sub-sections of settled folk and nomads mixed, of which the Erwa, Gufa, Beni Ibrahim, and Rifa'a, are by far the most numerous; also nine of villagers (A1 Hadhar), sherifial and non-sherifial; and three of pure Beduins. (ii) Musa, under Sa'd el-Ghaneim, living north of Jebel Radhwah and behind Umlej, largely in the Wadi' Ais, which contains many small oases. This section, however,is more predominantly nomadic. It has twenty-six sub sections, of which the Marawin and the Samarah are most numerous. The Juheinah do a good deal of slave-running and con traband trade. 6.—HARB. The Harb are Ahl esh-Shimal. They are a powerful and warlike tribe of Hejaz and of Western Nejd, occupying the coast of the Red Sea from south of Yambo* to south of Jiddah, and again from south of Lith to near Qunfudah; also all the mountain country between Medina and Mecca, and the desert to the north-east up to Jebel Abanat. Inland their country extends up to the Kheibar harrah and the upper course of Wadi Rummah, west of Qasim, but it does not touch the latter ; the direct track from Ha il to Mecca is, more or less, the line dividing them from the 'Ateibah. Their clans in the Hejaz Come under the influence of the King, though they pay him tribute only when it suits them. They are responsible for the safety of the southernmost section of the Hejaz railway, i.e. for about fifty miles north of Medina, but their connexion with the pilgrim traffic is chiefly of a less respectable kind; for they rob caravans on the Mecca road, kill and plunder stragglers, and extort money at every opportunity. The ' Auf clans are noted highwaymen, much dreaded by the pilgrimage. The arrangement and constitution of the Harb are less certainly ascertained than those of any other of the greater Arabian tribes. The majority of the best authorities {e.g. among the older ones. Burton and Doughty) recognize only two main sections, Beni Salim and Masruh, and include under thf. latter the Beni 'Amr, the 'Auf, and the Zobeid, all of which are rated by some other authorities as independent sections. While, therefore, the Beni Salim with their principal sub-sections are fairly certainly known, the relations of all the rest remain very doubtful, and the— 88 — sectional and sub-sectional arrangement, given below, can only be provisional. No sub-section, however, is named upon whose existence and relation to a section two good authorities, at least, do not agree. Sheikhs' names are given with all reserves. The Hejaz Harb include all the Beni Salim, most of the f Auf and Zobeid sub-sections of the Masruh, and most of the Beni 'Amr. These are cultivators, fishermen, and carriers for the greater parfc, and not camel breeders; but they include many nomads, e.g. the bulk of the Subh sub-section of the Beni Salim, and several f Auf clans, notorious for predatory instincts and life. The Zobeid as a whole are settled along the coast from near Yambo' down to Serom, south of Jiddah, their centre being at Rabugh ; and there is also an Asir section south of Lith {see ' Asir Handbook,' p. 29). The Harb of the North-east are mainly c Auf and Beni 1 Amr. The latter own most of the date gardens near Medina, and one of the sub-sections of the former, the Beni 'AH (a turbulent lot of Shiahs), cultivate those about Kubah in the 'Awali plains. The total strength of the Harb may be over two hundred thousand souls. The tribe recognizes no one paramount chief, and the Turks used to employ various persons to deal with the clans in different districts. Of these the most influential seems to have been, and to be, the ' Emir el- Harb,' Ahmed el-Mansiir, whose vague authority is accepted (under the King) more or less throughout the western part of the Harb country, if not more widely. Taking the Harb as having only two main sections, we arrange the clans as below. But it must be stated empha tically that the sub-sections, even if here assigned to their proper relations, are not to be assumed to form political unities because so grouped. The same caution applies also to the clans. It is very doubtful indeed how far any sectional and sub-sectional arrangement is valid in the case of the Harb ; and probably, for practical purposes, it would be more useful to regard the tribe as a collection of clans— 41 — and south of the 'Ateibah country. The tribe has no one paramount chief. The whole tribe acknowledges now the authority of the King of Hejaz ; but Ibn Sa'ud of Riyadh puts in from time to time a claim to the allegiance of the Ik Berqah section, which used to acknowledge him, more or less. He has not forgiven them for harbouring the rebel Aulad Sa'ud in 1911, and, unless restrained by agreement with, or fear of, Mecca, he is always apt to raid them, as he did in 1911 and 1912. They, for their part, sometimes raid Ibu into his province of Woshm and interfere with Qasim. The ill^j control of and the right of taxing them form the chief bone of contention between Riyadh and Mecca. The whole tribe is now well armed, and it supplied a considerable contingent to the Meccan army in 1916. The difficulty of making these and Harb tribesmen stand together was overcome. The sub-sections are not well known, and any scheme of them must be regarded as provisional and, probably, incomplete. The following list is given with all reserve, particularly as regards sub-sections :— 1. Rflqah. Feihan Ibn Muheyya. Sub-Sections:— Hafu ( a, Mardshida, Dhawi Breish, Dharabha, Ma- zahma, Dhawi 'Atiyah, Silasah, Qoreish, Mahddlah, Sihdrah, Huteim, Hufdah, Al Himrdn. 2. Berqah. Ibn Himayid. Sub-Sections:— Dawdsir, Jiddn, Thidbah, Al Misin, Fizrd'n, Na- weirah, Dhawi 'Omar, Beni Khawdtir, Al Jaramin, Dhawi Sind ( n, Fuqaha, Warqdn, Haiva* ma, Dhawi Suleiman, Fard ( na, Al Sighayin, Al Qumeishdt, Al Jabarin, Hidddf, Mahamid, Dhafarin, Hijizah, Khandfirah, Al Khimdd, Al Haivdranah, Mafaleit.— 42 — 3, 'Abud. Sub-Sections:— Jibdrah, Al Khalad, Dawaniyah, Al Ashdshamah, Dihasah, Hitamah. 4. Dara in. Hamud Ibn Daran. Sub-Sections:— Muheyya, Jasafin, Dhawi Khalifah, Dhawi * Abdullah. 5c Nafarin. Sultan Ibn Sanhut. Sub-Sections:— Jidah, NiJchdshah, Nifa. 8.—ASHRAF. The Ashraf in general are the descendants of Hasan, who was son of f Ali and Fatimah, and through the flatter grandson of the Prophet. There are said to be twenty-one clans of this descent scattered over Arabia, of which fifteen live wholly or in part in Hejaz or North-west Asir, and chiefly in and near Mecca. For the most part numerically small, they derive importance from the consideration which their individual members enjoy throughout Arabia. The Emirs (Grand Sherifs) of Mecca have been derived from one or another branch of the descendants of Abu Numeyi (who was of the Qatadah stock) for so many centuries, that succession to this office is, in practice, as much confined by prescription to two or three only of these clans, as the Sul tanate of Turkey is to the House of Othman. The mutual affinities, the interconnection, and the present condition of the Ashraf clans, are not well known ; and— 43 — many of them are mere names to us. But something can be said about the chief among them, which are of political or tribal importance. (а) 'Ahddilah is the ruling clan at present, being that to which the King and his house belong. It is descended from Sherif 'Abdullah, grandson of Mohammed Abu Numeyi (1631). It was raised to power by Mohammed t Ali of Egypt in 1827 during his occupation of Hejaz, in place of the Dhawi Zeid who had held the throne since the latter part of the eighteenth century and also in earlier times. Previously, the Emirate had been with the Dhawi Barakat. The 'Abadilah clan is partly settled, the bulk of it living outside Mecca south of the Jiddah road. Many of its members hold office under the King. {See Section VII, ' Personalities.') (б) Dhawi Zeid. The Dhawi Zeid clan, which descends from Zeid, great-great-grandson of Mohammed Abu Numeyi, is settled in Mecca. The descendants of 'Abd el-Mutallib and Ghalib are of this clan, and there is rivalry and bad feeling between it and the 'Abadilah. The Dhawi Zeid own a large amount of property in Mecca and Jiddah and possess many slaves. (c) Shenabrah. The Shenabrah, who descend from an eponymous Sherif, Shanbar, not of a ruling house, form now a small clan to the south of Mecca, numbering not more than 150 men. Being related to the 'Abadilah, they used to support the Emir of Mecca, but are said to have been less loyal latterly. Sherif Judallah is their head. The Shenab rah are brave and lawless and are generally at loggerheads with the Dhawi Surur. (d) Dhawi Surur. The Dhawi Surur, descendants of Sherif Surur, who ruled as Emir in the latter part of the eighteenth century, number about 200 men and wander over the country to the south of Mecca, being entirely nomadic. They are of Dhawi Zeid stock, and opposed to— 44 — the Shenabrah. Sherif Dukhan is their Chief Sheikh. Sub clans are Auldd el-Hasan and Al * Aziz. (e) Dhawi Barakdt. The Dhawi Barakat, descendants of Barakat, third son of Mohammed Abu Numeyi, are no longer m Hejaz proper, where they held the supreme power up to the latter part of the eighteenth century, and at a shghtly later period, were robbers in Wadi Fatimah. ey are said by Burckhardt to have been exhausted bv wars of succession. They are now found in North-western Asir organized as a tribe {see 'Asir Handbook,' p. 29). (/) Dhaivi Hasan. Descendants of Hasan, second son of Mohammed Abu Numeyi, are also no longer in Hejaz, but in North-western Asir, organized as a tribe (see 'Asir Handbook,' p. 28). Other Ashraf clans of Hejaz, e.g. El-Hirdz, Dhawi &lt;Ahd el-Kenm, El-Hurith, El-Menema, Dhawi Jizdn, Dhawi Judallah, El-Manadil, Dhawi Ihrdhim, and Dhaivi f Amr, are, apparently, not of actual political importance. 9.—HUDHEIL. A partly nomadic tribe ranging all round Mecca itself, but chiefly on the road to Ta'if, vid Jebel Qora. Of the' same stock as the Juhadlah (g.v.), they are closely allied with these, but foes of the 'Ateibah and Harb. They go with the King of Hejaz, but are a predatory lot, who trouble the annual pilgrimage to 'Arafat. There are said to be two sections, of which No. 1 has seven clans :— Mutdrafah (Wadi Fatimah), Maiud (Ria es-Seil), Sowahar (Ria es-Seil), Beni 'Amer, Meta'dn (from Mecca to Jiddah) Lahiydn (east of Mecca), Janabir (El-Qora). No. 2 has eight clans :— Garhiyah, MarzuUyah, Sarwdni, Yabkabi, Beni Fahm. Nadwiyah, Dadiyah, and 'Abadiyah.10.—FAHAM (BENI). A small tribe living in Wadi Waghar, to the east of the Juhadlah and between these and the Beni Thaqif. They are entirely nomadic and are noted for their skill in tracking. They are friendly with the Beni Thaqif and Juhadlah and are faithful to Sherif 'Ali, deposed Emir of Mecca, now in Egypt. Their Chief Sheikh is Tsma'il Ibn Dahian. They number about 1,000 men. Related to the Qoreish. 11.—JUHADLAH. The Juhadlah are an entirely nomad tribe with no defined limits; but such boundaries as they have may be said to be ; on the north, a line beginning south of Serom, the southern limit of the Harb, and on the south a line running inland just north of Lith. They occupy all the coast and take a wide sweep inland to the east of Jebel Abu Shanq and Jebel Sa'diyah. Their neighbours on the south are the A1 Mahdi and Dhawi Barakat, and, to the north-east of Lith, the Beni Faham. They also mingle with the Dhawi Surur and Shenabrah to the south of Mecca, and are generally to be found along the road from Mecca to Jebel 'Arafat and east to Shaddad and Jebel Muhram. From Serom to Lith, however, is their original district, their chief centre being round Sa'diyah. They number about 4,000 men, and although good fighters, are not quarrelsome. Their country is a poor one and affords scanty pasturage to their herds of camels in which they are fairly rich. In times of drought they go south to AVadi Dokhah in the Dhawi Barakat country. They do not cultivate but buy all their grain from Ta'if or Lith in return for the semn which they sell. They all carry spears and knives, and, those who can afford them, rifles. For purposes of internal administration, the tribe is divided into two parts, the one under Mohammed Ibn Sa'id,ill — 46 — the other under Mohammed Ibn Hanesh. The former is faithful to the King of Hejaz. Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Hanesh, who rules over the AI Mnnifiyah, keeps chiefly to Sa'diyah and the coast. He has made overtures to Idrisi, but is too far off and too weak to do more than sympathize with him. He was neutral during the Turco- Sherifian expedition in 1910, and removed his tribe into the inaccessible mountains. The two Chief Sheikhs are on good terms with each other, and the sub-tribes freely intermingle. They are friendly towards the Dhawi Hasan and Beni Faham, but inimical to the Harb. The 'Ateibah, though distant, raid them when they stray too far east. The Hudheil and they are of one origin and are on terms of the closest friendship. The Juhadlah are hospitable to strangers but have little religion and seldom go on the pilgrimage. In person, they are taller than most Arabs, wear their hair short and are dressed in a red tob ' which reaches from the waist to the knee, the end being thrown over the left shoulder. (а) Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Sa'id, over sub-tribes :— Alianiyah, Sheyniyah, Hershiyah, Jamshiyah, Tha- baniyah, Hasnaniyah, Jirshiyah. (б) Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Hanesh, over:— (]) Al Munif, of which the chief sub-divisions are :— Al es-Sihim (Mohammed es-Sultan). Al Madathir (Husein Ibn Haneish). Beni Bur (Masud Ibn Mohammed). Al Yam (Mohammed Ibn Muhsin), Al Zahein (Mizhar Ibn Sihman). (2) Hijriah, of which the chief sub-division is :— Al Faham (Haidar Ibn Haneish).— 47 — 12.—MAHDI (AL). The A1 Mahdi are a small semi-nomad tribe near Lith, who make their living chiefly as fishermen. They are a poor and down-trodden people, thoroughly awed by their powerful neighbours the Dhawi Hasan. They do not number more than 200 souls. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Qas'im. Chief clans :— El-Mu]eishah (Ahmed Ibn Masudah). A1 Hasan {Ibn Ahmed er-Rideini). 13.—SA D (BENI). A tribe of Southern Hejaz, tracing its descent to Himyar. It is bounded on the north by the Nasri, on the south by the Beni Malik, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham and Southern Juhadlah. Their country is more fertile than that of their northern neighbours, wells being plentiful, and they raise cereals and fruits. There are no nomads amongst them. They favour the King of Hejaz and can provide him with about 1,000 men. Hamza Ibn Mohammed is their Chief Sheikh.^ There is enmity between them and the Shalawah, and with the Juhadlah they are by no means friendly. They combine with the Beni Thaqif, Beni Malik, and Nasri, in times of danger, 14.—THAQIF (BENI). A tribe, descended from Himyar, in the highlands to the south of Ta'if. They are bounded on the north by the northern section of the Juhadlah, on the south by the Beni Nasri, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham. They are almost entirely settled and agricultural and grow cereals, grapes, and other fruits for the Ta'if market. For— 48 — water they depend partly on the summer rains, but chiefly on well-water. Nasir Ibn Ghawal is their Chief Sheikh, a firm adherent of the King of Hejaz. He commands about 2,000 fighting men. In times of crisis they combine with the Beni Malik, Beni Sa'd, and Beni Nasri. They are always at feud with the Beni Faham, and are not cordial to the Juhadlah. They possess very few camels. A certain proportion of the tribe lives permanently in Ta'if. The chief sub-tribes are Sufidn, Moadher, and Rabiyah. 15.—MALIK (BENI). The Beni Malik of the Hejaz (see 'Asir Handbook' for the Asiri tribe of the name) are a small tribe numbering not more than 2,000 men who live in the mountains inland of Lith. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Sa'd on the north, the Shalawah nomads on the east, the Zahran on the south, and the Juhadlah on the west. The Beni Malik are not a fighting tribe, but they are hospitable and industrious and cultivate figs and grapes in the wadis as well as wheat, barley, and dura. During the pilgrimage season most of them go to Mecca and Jiddah and act as porters. They thus come more into contract with the outside world than most tribes, and are more civilized. They are devoted to the King of Hejaz and pay him taxes. Nasir Ibn Rawwaf is their Chief Sheikh. They live at peace with their neighbours, except the Shalawah, who occasionnally raid them. Most of their villages are clustered in Wadi Luz and Wadi Rum a'an. 16.—NASRI (BENI). A tribe, descended from Himyar, in the country to the south of the Beni Thaqif in Southern Hejaz ; bounded on the north by the Beni Thaqif, south by the Beni Sa'd, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham.They are entirely agricultural and settled, and raise cereals and fruits, utilizing tlie water from wells in addition to the yearly rains. Bakhit Ibn Surur is their Chief Sheikh, a faithful adherent of the King of Hejaz, as are all the tribe. They dislike the Beni Faham and are suspicious of the southern Juhadlah, and, when real fighting is to be done, combine with the Beni Thaqif, Beni Malik, and Beni Sa'd.VI. —POLITICAL. 1.—Government. The Turks. —Under the Ottoman arrangement, Hejaz was a vilayet, whose vali resided at Mecca in winter and Ta'if in summer (except when the pilgrimage fell in the summer months). His province included all the area from the border of the vilayet of Sham (Damascus), south of Ma'an, down to the northern limit of the vilayet of Yemen, south of Lith. Under him were four Jcdzas, Yambo', Kabugh, Jiddah, and Lith. In these the apparatus of government was organized on the usual Ottoman system, the officials of the Porte collecting all taxes, so far as taxes could be collected at all in such a province as Hejaz. The towns of Mecca and Medina, however, were not only tax-free so far as the Ottoman Government was concerned, but in receipt of subsidies from the Treasury {surra) ; and so also were many nomad chiefs, notably certain Harb sheikhs, capable of interfering with the passage of pilgrims or with the railway track. The whole province was exempt from military service, and an attempt to prevail upon the Hejazis to accept conscription in 1914 was resisted success fully by the Emir of Mecca. The Porte, however, maintained its own forces in Hejaz under the exclusive command of its own officers. The normal garrison, including the Emir's own guard of 500 men, was about 7,000 with three batteries, of which force a large part was usually cantonned along the Hejaz railway line, the proper garrisons of Mecca, Medina, Jiddah, Yambo', and Ta'if being kept much below strength. The result was that only the chief centres of settled population, and the Hejaz railway line, were effectively and continuously held. Other lines of communication were all precarious. The road from Medina to Yambo', for example, required a strong— 51 — escort, and the pilgrim tracks from Medina to Mecca were more often closed by the Harb than open, payments of surra notwithstanding. The direct road from Mecca to Ta'if by 'Arafat was notoriously unsafe, and even on the Jiddah road, in the intervals between blockhouses, murders and highway robberies were of common occurrence. Emirate. —Side by side, however, with this foreign govern ment there existed the very real, though long mediatized, authority of the Emir (or 'Grand Sherif'') of Mecca. This Emirate, whose institution (a result of the decline of the early Caliphial regime in the Moslem world) dates from the tenth century, was, until the last years of the eighteenth century, the sole de facto power in Hejaz, having in that century cast off all but the shadow of dependence on the Porte, which kept a precarious hold on Jiddah alone. The Wahabite invasion, however, followed by the impo sition of E yptian rule upon Hejaz, brought about a change. Mohammed ? Ali of Egypt reduced the Emir to a cipher, and when the Porte resumed direct control of Hejaz in 1840, its firmer hand and the internecine dissensions of the Sherifial clans and families in Mecca prevented the Emirate from recovering its eighteenth century position. It did, however, gradually improve its status, having retained the loyalty of the Beduins of West Central Arabia. The Emir's allowance was increased by the Porte to £1,000 a month, and with this, added to private means largely derived from lands in Egypt and Mesopotamia, he maintained a large household and a strong body-guard. He was recognized as the chief executive officer in Mecca itself, and as enjoying an extra-territorial independence there and at Ta'if, with the right to keep official representatives to watch his own and Meccan interests at Jiddah, Medina, and elsewhere. In spite of the strengthening of Ottoman power in Hujaz by Othman Pasha in 1886, the astute Emir, 'Aun er-Rafiq, kept and increased his privileged position, the relation between Vali and Emir being not unlike that between a Resident and a Rajah in a mediatized native state of India.— 52 — Although the Porte could not, the Emir could, call out considerable levies of Hejazi and other Beduins, and by so doing, in order to fight the Turks' battles, the Emirs of Mecca and particularly the present prince, Husein, not only made interest with the Porte, but inspired it with a whole some respect, and, further, kept in touch with a fighting force which could be used some day for their own ends. T his position of the Emir of Mecca as a great Beduin chief was bound to increase with the decline of Ottoman strength ; and it is by using it that Sherif Husein, now King, even -before his revolt, almost restored the Emirate to the power and independence it had enjoyed before the Wahabite invasion. Since bis revolt (begun June 5, 1916), Husein has become de facto sovereign of all Hejaz except Medina ; but tracks leading south-westward from Medina ha\ r e been (and, at the time of writing, are) held by Turkish troops for distances varying from forty to sixty miles. He was recognized as ' King of Heiaz' de jure by the Entente Power? (December 1916), after his assumption of the title ' King of the Arab Nation' in a general assembly held at Mecca on Moharrem 2 (October 29). This dignity is still too precarious, and any development of the governmental machine, consequent upon it, is still too much in embryo for it to be worth while to deal here with anything beyond the provisional organization under which Hejaz has been administered since the Ottoman machine ceased to work. For the moment the King has adopted the existing Otto man system, but simplified it by eliminating much of the bureaucratic personnel, and placing reliance on his patriar chal hold over the sheikhs, both those having authority in the settled societies and those of the tribes. The last he makes responsible for the behaviour and the contributions of the several tribal (clan) units, generally attaching to each man of importance a representative or Hakim chosen from his own immediate adherents. He has set governors over the towns, but checks and controls each, through an agent, /who is enjoined to keep in the background but to report direct to himself. As for taxes, he has tried to collect at present little beyond customs dues and octroi, his financial resources being in the main external. The pure Shari'a Law- is the only code recognized, and any modification of this to suit non-Moslems, or modern conditions, is for the future. A police force has been recruited, mainly from Wadi Bishah Shahran, who are a sturdy lot, feudally attached to the Sherifial house by old prescription, and were constituents of the Emir's body-guard under the former mediatized regime. But outside the towns and to some extent inside them too, the patriarchal authority and resources of sheikhs are expected to do the police work. The King tends everywhere to encourage and rely on immemorial Beduin organization as a basis of society and guarantee of order. For the present emergency he keeps under arms some 30,000 men, mainly from the tribes, and these are organized on an irregular guerilla footing under their own sheikhs and the superior command of his own sons or intimates. A nucleus of a standing regular force has been formed from Bishawa, townsmen, volunteers from without, amnestied prisoners once in Ottoman service, and the fellahin who are an element in the Harb and Juheinah tribes ; but little more than cadres have yet come into existence, and not always these. The King has modern weapons and ammu nition at his disposal, but not yet enough men capable of making effective use of them. The Emirate of Mecca has been, in theory, neither here ditary nor restricted, except by prescription, to any one Sherifial clan or family ; and in actual practice the Emirs, for a century past, including the present prince, who was sent from Constantinople to take the office in 1908, have owed their succession to direct nomination by the Govern ment of the foreign occupying power. The Porte kept to the ' Abadilah house after 1827, twice only interpolating a member of the rival DhawiZeid house for short terms (1851 — 1856 and 1880-1882) on the divide et impera principle. It hasalways been a disadvantage of the Emirs that members, not only of other Sherifial clans, but also of their own houses^ hold themselves as well or better entitled to the Emirate ; and, as a consequence, Meccan history has been one long record of intrigue. But the rival houses have rarely come to blows. It is well to bear in mind that, in Mecca itself, is always centred a strong opposition to the ruling house, and an Emir or King can hardly fail to have foes, 'even of his own household. Grand Sherif is a European invention. The Arabs have always called the prince of Mecca 'Emir' and addressed him as Seyyidna (Our Lord). From the Turks he had the titles ' Highness ' and ' Pasha,' his sons being commonly called Beys.' These Ottoman titles, however, are no longer used in Hejaz, and, if any title is prefixed to the names of the royal princes, it is, in conversation, 'Sidi,' and, on paper, 'Emir.' 2.—Recent History and Politics. The King, Sherif Husein Ibn f Ali, grandson of the first Abadilah Emir (died in 1858;, and great-great-grandson of Aun, who was fourth in descent from Emir 'Abdullah, who was grandson of ' Mohammed Abu Numeyi, is now over sixty-three years of age. He was nominated by the anglophile Grand Vezir, Kiamil Pasha, in 1908, after a long residence at Constantinople. Husein's uncle, 'Abdillah, had died on the way to take up the position at Mecca to which he had been nominated, after the banishment of the former Emir, c Ali, with his family to Egypt. Husein's cousins, the children of f Aun er-Rafiq, Emir from 1882 to 1905, were also interdicted by the Porte. Husein was appointed as a man of pacific character, likely both to serve the Porte's purposes and also to keep on good terms with ourselves. In the earlv years of his Emirate he appeared zealously to be fulfilling the first hope. In 1910 he took up arms for the Turks against the Asirrebels under Idrisi and succeeded in relieving Ebhah, and seriously reducing Idrisi's power. In the same year he sent an expedition to Qasim to assert the rights of the 'Ateibah ; and though, through the defection of Ibn Rashid, he had to retire content with an arrangement with Ibn Sa'ud, under which the f Ateibah were to remain free of the latter's taxes and the Meccan Treasury asserted its right to a contri bution from Qasim, his influence had been extended to Central Arabia. Shortly afterwards he took under his protection certain fugitive rebels of Ibn Sa'ud's house, for sheltering whom the 5 Ateibah had been raided. His rela tions with Ibn Sa'ud continued, however, outwardly peaceful, and those with Ibn Rashid friendly. Husein, however, from the first, under the stimulus of his powerful second son, 5 Abdullah, had cherished the design of emancipating the Meccan Emirate from dependence on the Porte; and though he himself does not seem to have aimed at the Caliphate, 'Abdullah has been credited with that ambition. The Emir's early pro-Ottoman expeditions had served to organize a Beduin force, which could be used at need. From 1913 he began to follow an anti- Ottoman policy, opposing the extension of the Hejaz railway and supporting the Harb tribesmen in their resistance to both this and other Turkish projects. From the outbreak of the present war, he steadily refused to help the Turks to recruit in Hejaz, and though for fear of having to submit to crippling requisitions, he gave way so far as to allow his eldest son, Ali, to raise an irregular regiment of Beduins at Medina for service in Sinai, he continued to organize the Hejaz tribes, which acknowledge his authority, with a view to insur rection at the proper moment; and, approaching Idrisi and the Imam of Yemen, tried to unite them in a common anti-Ottoman aim. His third son, Feisal, was despatched to Constantinople early in 1915, and on his return to Syria, got into communication with the pan- Arabists, and though obliged to accompany Enver to Medinain February 1916, he returned to Syria to continue the same work. By the spring of 1915 Husein had become the only effective power in Hejaz with wide influence outside, extending south ward to Wadi Bishah, and northward to the southern Anezah tribes. Both in Mecca and Medina (in which last city he kept his eldest son, f Ali, as his representative) he had reduced Turkish authority very low, and even in Jiddah, his agents wielded the most influence. But the Porte was maintaining its garrisons, in spite of temporary interruptions of railway communication; and, under their protection, the Ottoman officials held on. In May 1916 a strict naval patrol of the Hejaz coast was re-enforced by us, in order to support the Emir by demonstrating to the Arabs the inevitable results of further submission to Ottoman occupation; Turkish reinforcements^ destined for Yemen, continued to arrive at Medina, and forced 'Abdullah to anticipate his plans; and early in June, an insurrection of tribes, including both Harb and 'Ateibah, broke out under the leadership of the Emir and his sons. Since no static point has yet been reached by this insur rection, and its outcome is still uncertain, we shall only add a calendar of its principal military stages. On June 5, f Ali and Feisal, supported by certain Harb and 'Ateibah units and a few Juheinah, proclaimed the revolt outside Medina, loosely invested the place, and tore up some of the Hejaz railway some miles to the north. On June 9, Sherif Muhsin el-Mansur, with 4,000 Zobeid Harb and other tribesmen, attacked Jiddah; the Emir shut the Turkish troops into the Mecca forts and barracks, and 'Abdullah formed the siege of Ta'if. On June 13, Mecca was altogether in the Emir's hands, except two fortified points, and also the blockhouses on the Jiddah-Mecca road had been reduced. On June 16, Jiddah surrendered. On June 23, a Sherifial detachment occupied Lith. On July 4, the last Mecca fort capitulated, and was followed, on July 10, by the barracks ; this completed the capture of that town. Meanwhile the siege of Medina57 i rnsui- made no progress, and, early in July, after a Turkish sortie to ' Awali, in which the Arab camp was sacked, and outrages were committed, the Sherifs withdrew some distance southward, leaving the Turks free to reinforce the place, Ta'if was now more closely besieged. On July 3, Qunfudah was occupied by Idnsi's troops, its Turkish garrison having previously surrendered to a British warship. On July 27, the Turkish garrison at Yambo' capitulated, after Sherifial troops and a warship had been sent up the coast from Jiddah. Meanwhile, on July 22, a party of the Sherif's men from Lith had appeared before Qunfudah, but Idrisi did not evacuate it until August 25, and then only under protest. On August 3, the Turks made a sortie from Medina down the Fura Road to Ghadir Rabugh and suffered some loss. About the same time Umlej surrendered to a Juheinah chief, acting for the Sherif, Meanwhile the Billi (whose chief, Suleiman Rufadah, was approached by us on September 3 without success) and Husein Mubeirik, the Zobeid Sheikh of Rabugh, remained hostile. An attempt by the Turks early in September to push the Syrian ' Mahmal ' through from Medina failed. On September 23, Ta'if at last surrendered with all its gar rison and officials, including the Turkish mli. Ghalib Pasha, The Egyptian 'Mahmal' arrived three days later, and the Haj j duly took place, the number of foreign pilgrims, how ever, being small. On October 3, Turks from Ebhah retook Qunfudah, but subsequently, on October 10, withdrew to an entrenched position inland, and a force, sent by the Sherif, under Mohammed Nasir, reoccupied the town. The Turks, however, had meanwhile issued from Medina, to prosecute an offensive-defensive, and by October 6 reached Bir 'Abbas on the Sultani Road. They established headquar ters at Bir Derwish and outposts at and near Bir el-Mashi on the Fura Road. Here they remained practically station ary till December. Meanwhile various attempts were made on the railway by the Arabs. A rival Emir, 'Ali Haidar, of the Dhawi58 — I Zeid, had been nominated by the Porte and arrived in Medina on July 26, where he remained issuing proclamations and trying to buy off the tribes. Towards the end of October the Turks came a little forward to Bir Raha and Bir 'Abbas, and sent a reconnoitring party down the Sultani Road as far as Bir Ibn el-Hasani. On October 29, the Emir assumed the title ' Malik ' (see p. 52). Early in November his sons again took the offensive, 'Abdullah going up the Darb esh-Sharqi, Feisal operating from Hamra, and 'Ali pushing his front up to Bir Ibn el-Hasani; but the Turks pushed Feisal back before the end of the month, and early in December advanced again, having received considerable reinforcements at Medina; on the 10th of the month they were between Bir Sa'id and Yambo' on the one hand, and at Wasta on the other, and, after Sherif Zeid had been surprised and put to flight near the latter place, Feisal withdrew into Yambo' and the Turks occupied all the wadi villages down to Nakhl Mubarak. By Christmas, however, they had retired again to Bir Sa'id and Hamra; but on December 23, on a false report that the Subh Harb had deserted, 'Ali and his force retired upon Rabugh. Feisal meanwhile had emerged from Yambo' again, after that town had been put into a state of defence, and 'Abdullah, established at Wadi Khanq, was in a position to cut off the supplies which Medina had been drawing for some time from Kuweit and Nejef, via Hail. On the Gaha and Fura Roads the Turks withdrew somewhat, but continued to occupy Wadi Safrah. Early in December the King had come to Jiddah, and definitely stated that he desired no auxiliary force landed at Rabugh or elsewhere that was not Moslem, and his policy was justified presently by a slackening of the Turkish offensive. By the end of January 1917, Wadi Safrah had been evacuated, and Grhayir remained the farthest point to the southward held by the enemy in strength. This with drawal had been due partly to successful raids made by Harb clans on the line of communications, and by 'Abdullaheast and north-east of Medina. In the middle of the month Feisal, who had reorganized a large tribal army, moved on Wejh via Umlej, and 'Abdullah passed across the railway to Wadi ! Ais to support him. Feisal reached Wejh on the 26th, but found the place had already been captured on the 23rd and 24th by a sea-borne contingent, aided by British naval units. He remained at Wejh to organize further offensives against the railway, and he was joined by most of the Billi (but not their Chief) and some Beni c Atiyah and Huweitat clans. Early in February Dhabah and Muweilah were evacuated by their Turkish garrisons and occupied for the King of Hejaz. Some part of the retreating Turks were cut off by Huweitat tribesmen; the rest got through to Tebuk which, in common with other chief stations on the railway, had been reinforced and strengthened by the enemy. Meanwhile, though the Turks maintained their advanced post at Bir el-Mashi on the Gaha road, they were sending troops north from Medina and evacuating the civil population of the town.— 60 — VIL—PERSONALITIES. 1.—Ruling Family. The King. Husein Ibn 'Ali el-'Aun {see also pp. 54 §.). Succeeded to the Emirate in 1908 and assumed the title of King (Malik) on October 29, 1916. About sixty-three years of age; of medium height and intelligent countenance.. His complexion is fair, and his features are regular and fine; large and expressive brown eyes gazing very directly from beneath strongly marked eyebrows, under an ample forehead; a short and delicately curved nose over a slightly elongated upper lip. The mouth full, but, for an Oriental, far from large; the lower lip prominent and exposed; teeth well formed and well preserved. The beard thick and not long, grey almost to whiteness. Hands long and strong, with square-tipped musician-like fingers. Outwardly so gentle and considerate as almost to seem weak; but this appearance hides a deep and subtle policy, wide ambitions, and an un-Arabian foresight, strength of character, and persistence. Of extreme dignity of deportment, but, at the sam0 time, of gracious and convincing address. His grand-mother was a Circassian, and he speaks Turkish fluently. Through long residence at Constantinople he knows Turks well and something also of Europeans; but he has brought up his sons, since their Stambul schooling, as desert Arabs, and he claims their respect and even fear. These sons are :— 'Ali.—Short and slim, looking a little old already, though only thirty-seven. Slightly bent. Skin rather sallow, large deep brown eyes, nose thin and a little hooked ; face somewhat worn and full of lines and hollows, mouthSon, died young. (0 in er-Ra£iq &lt;r Abdillah Sultan. (]% 1882-1905). (Emir, 1907-1908). f imed f Abdul f Aziz icted : resides at id Constantinople). f Abdul * A member of grandson of the Emir Mesaid, was appointed Emir 1851-1856, and ag'— 61 — drooping. Beard spare and black. Has very delicate hands. His manners are perfectly simple, and he is ob viously a very conscientious, careful, pleasant, gentleman, without force of character, nervous and rather tired. His physical weakness makes him subject to quick fits of shaking passion with more frequent moods of infirm obstinacy. Apparently not ambitious for himself, but swayed some what too easily by the wishes of others. Is bookish, and learned in law and religion. Shows his Arab blood more than his brothers. Used to represent his father at Medina, where before the revolt it fell to him to negotiate the passage of Ghalib Pasha through the Harb tribesmen to take up his position at Mecca ; and later to enroll a battalion of miscel laneous Arabs to join the Ottoman forces in Sinai. In the revolt he commanded at first near Medina, but later fell back and took direction of the miscellaneous force in the Rabugh district. Is (nominally) the president of his father's Ministry. Like all his brothers, he speaks Turkish well. 'Abdullah. —Aged thirty-five, but looks younger. Short and thick built, apparently as strong as a horse, with merry dark brown eyes, a round smooth face, full but short lips, straight nose, brown beard. In manner affectedly open and very charming, not standing at all on ceremony, but jesting with the tribesmen like one of their own sheikhs. On serious occasions he judges his words carefully, and shows himself a keen dialectician. Is probably not so much the brain as the spur of his father. He is obviously working to establish the greatness of the family, and has large ideas, which no doubt include his own particular advancement. The Arabs consider him a most astute politician, and a far-seeing statesman : but he has possibly more of the former than of the latter in his composition. Is called Minister of Foreign Affairs in his father s Ministry, and justifies it by showing more acquaintance with the outer world than his brothers. Seems to understand, andcan read, French, if not English, but, like Feisal, will not admit it, as foreign accomplishments might hurt his prestige. Commanded the army at Ta'if and on the Darb esh-Sharqi; moved to Wadi 'Ais from Henakiyah in January 1917. Feisal. Is tall, graceful, vigorous, almost regal in ap pearance. Aged thirty-one. About 5 feet 101 inches high 24-mch waist, broad-shouldered. Very quick and restless m movement. Far more imposing personally than any oi his brothers ; knows it and trades on it. Dresses very particularly and is almost prudish in speech. As clear- skmned as a pure Circassian, with dark hair, vivid black eyes set a little sloping in his face, strong nose, short chin. .Looks like a European. He is hot tempered, proud and impatient, sometimes unreasonable, and runs off easily at a tangent. Possesses far more personal magnetism and life than his brothers, but less prudence. Obviouslv very clever perhaps not over scrupulous. Eather narrow- minded, and rash when he acts on impulse, but usuallv with tt 0 ^? ® tren o^ to re flect, and then exact in judgment. Had he been brought up the wrong way might have become a barrack-yard officer. A popular idol, and ambitious : lull ot dreams, and the capacity to realize them, with keen personal insight, and a very efficient man of business Is Minister of the Interior in his father's Ministry, and undoubtedly his most capable military commander. Inclined to be contemptuous of detail, and sits still badly • full of nerves. A power with tribesmen generallv, and very po- pular m Syria and Mesopotamia. Has commanded his father s Northern Army (the largest) since the siege of Medina and moved from the Yambo 5 district to Wejh at the end of January 1917. Zcid.—Aged about twenty. Is quite overshadowed by • the reputation of his half-brothers. His mother was Turkish, and he takes after her. Is fond of riding about and playing tricks. Has not so far been successfully— 63 — entrusted with any important commission, but is active. In manner a little loutish, but not a bad fellow. Humorous in outlook, and perhaps a little better balanced, because less intense, than his brothers. Shy. Commanded in the Yambo 5 district after Feisal's departure for Wejh. Nasir Ibn 'Ali, Younger brother of the King. Aged fifty-four. Was a member of the Ottoman Upper House, and has lived mainly at Constantinople. He has three (or four ?) sons.

Pan-Islamist, but inclines to the British interest. Maintains relations with Indian Moslems. Has been proposed as titular Caliph with a small territorial reservation at Damascus or elsewhere, on the. analogy of the Papacy; but it is not known if such was his own desire. His agent at Jiddah, Ahmed el-Hezazi (q.v.), was convicted of plotting against the Emir in 1916, and his house was looted by order on the capture of Jiddah in June. 'AliHaidar, himself, was nominated Emir by the Porte after the outbreak of the revolt, and ordered to repair to Medina. He arrived towards the end of July and was still there early in 1917.

He is a Hasani Sherif, of the Beni Ja'af sect (the other sherifian families in the Juheinah are the Aiaisha, Hajari, and Mahmedi) and is hardly admitted to the inner ring of Meccan Sherifian society, though they admit the authentic descent. He used to be pro-Turk, and later became anti-Feisal, as a result of the influence Feisal was gaining over the Juheinah. In 1910 went up to Akaba on behalf of the Sherif of Mecca, to mediate some family feuds of the Huweitat, and has great influence there, as everywhere in the Northern Hejaz. Joined Feisal at Umlej on January 18, and proved most useful in the advance on Wejh, and was later made Governor of Dhabah. Becoming blind. Mohammed 'All Lari. Of Jiddah. Rich carpet' merchant.

His family is celebrated, presumably for something that'his relations have been or done, as he has little personal authority. Mohammed Ibn 'Arif 'Areifan (Sheikh). Of Qadhimah in Wadi Ithwel. A Sheikh of the Zobeid section of the Masruh Harb, living about one hour inland from Has 'Arab (Makhlukh).

Is a general butt, and enjoys the position, as it makes him familiar with people of sheikhly families. His son, Salih, is a lad of about seventeen, quick, pleasant, intelligent, and did well in the attack on Wejh from the sea. He is quiet. Mohammed Nur. Of Jiddah ; chief tawwdf of pilgrims.

The two great divisions of Moslems, the Sunnis and Shiahs, follow three main land routes ;— 1. From Damascus due south to Medina. The Hejaz railway takes most of this traffic now ; but many pilgrims still march all the way under the Emir el-Hajj. Thence to Mecca. 2. Cairo by Sinai and Midian to Yambo ! and Medina or Mecca. 3. Baghdad, via Nejef, or Samawah and by Ha'il to Medina or Mecca. This pilgrimage has sometimes been diverted through Kuweit to Qasim by the action of the Nejd Emirs ; and it has been entirely intermitted during the past two years. A majority, however, of the total number of foreign pil grims now arrives by sea at the port of Jiddah and proceeds to Mecca. A comparatively small proportion goes on later to Medina, either overland, or by the ' half-sea ' route from Jiddah to Yam bo'. These usually return to Yambo'. The passage of pilgrims is the occasion of much trade, and merchants swell the caravans. It also leads to trouble with the Beduins, and thus to constant unrest; and it is a great cause of the spread of epidemic disease. The pilgrimage accounts in normal times for an annual influx of about a hundred and fifty thousand persons into Hejaz. All visit Mecca, but only about a third go to Medina also, the visit to the haram of the latter city not being strictly part of the pilgrimage at all, and involving considerable extra ex pense as well as some risk owing to the insecurity of all linesof caravan communication with Mecca. Not all, however arrive at once for the season of the great pilgrimage {hdjj)[ Besides the possibility of making a minor pilgrimage {umrah), at any time of the year, many pilgrims are induced to arrive at. Mecca before the end of Ramadan, i.e. more than two months before the great feast of the Moslem year (Yum en- Nahr=Qurban Bairam), which marks the H4jj season ; for by remaining till the feast and performing umrah, etc., daily, they accomplish tamatti (=possession), and enhance their merit. But owing to the cost of life at Mecca, this act of supererogation is for either the very rich or the very poor, who live on charity during their stay. The Hejazis have developed a regular organization for maintaining and increasing the supply of pilgrims, as well as for exploiting them on arrival. In the early months of the year their agents are busy in all parts of the Moslem world, preaching the necessity of pilgrimage, and offering (on commission) to arrange the journey, provide for lodging in Hejaz, and see the pilgrims through the obligatory ceremo nies. V* hen the time comes, some of these agents personally conduct parties or rich individuals to Hejaz, while at the ports or places of arrival, ciceroni (metawwa firi) await unac companied pilgrims, or such parties as are too large for their conductors. These ciceroni are organized under sheikhs, represent different Islamic countries, and wear a special dress of bright colours and a straw cap. Since they speak various languages, and many of them are travelled men, they offer, with the consular and customs agents, the main obstacle which non-Moslems in disguise, or foreign Moslems desirous to conceal their identity, have to face if they wish to perform the Hajj. They are all prepared to place the pilgrim, according to his nationality, in lodgings belonging either to themselves or others, Mecca in particular containing louses and apartments much in excess of the needs of its permanent inhabitants. Medina, owing to its more exclusive population and its smaller number of visitors, offers greater risks than Mecca, and its metawwqfin are more difficult to evade.The Hajj must be performed in the first ten days of the last month (Dhiil Hijja) of the Moslem lunar year. Like all other Moslem months, this moves round the solar year, and in 1915 coincided very nearly with our November. The pilgrim, who before entering the haram (sacred vicinity of Mecca) must have discarded the razor and his head and foot gear and assumed the ihrdm (a primitive dress consisting of two towel-like cotton cloths fastened round the body without the aid of knots or pins), spends the first seven days in circumambulating the Kabah seven times (tawdf), walking and running seven times between two hills, Safah and Merwah, each side of Mecca (sai), praying, attending sermons, visiting various traditional and holy sites near the city, etc. On the eighth, clad again in the ihrdm, he begins the most obligatory of all the ceremonies, the true ' Pilgrimage.' It consists in the visit to 'Arafat, a hillock in a plain, on the Ta/if road, under Jebel Qura. This trip, which used to be by no means without danger both on the road and in camp, despite the strong escorts provided, is obligatory not only on all visitors, but also, year by year, on all able-bodied citizens of Mecca, from the King downwards ; and in the opinion of most authorities it is the duty which, rather than any performed in Mecca itself, confers the coveted title of hdjji. The total number of those who march to 5 Arafat and back amounts normally to little under half a million. The enormous crowd bivouacs in and around the village of Munah the first night, and with daybreak on the ninth day proceeds other nine miles to Arafat to perform the ' Stand' on the hill, praying, ejaculating labbeika, and hearing addresses until sundown. Returning to Munah for the night, the pilgrim performs there another Stand on the morning of the tenth day, throws a fixed number of selected stones at certain devil-pillars, and offers a blood- sacrifice, usually a sheep or a goat, which he is at liberty to eat or give away. Then he must make post-haste for Mecca in the midst of indescribable confusion. In the city on that afternoon he should perform tawdj and sai, and kiss again— 90 — the Holy Stone of the Kahah ; and then, shaved and in secular dress, get back before dark to Munah for the day of the great feast. This he may celebrate partly at Munah, where many, especially those performing the pilgrimage for the first time, stay on for the three days of ' Drying Flesh ' {Ayyam et-Tashik), partly at Mecca. After this the pilgrimage is over and the hdjji either stays till a caravan can be formed for his journey under escort to Medina, or goes down to Jiddah carrying with him, more often than not, disease or infection engendered by the putrefaction of the sacrificial victims at Munah, by the holy but unwholesome waters of Zemzem, or by the pollution of the main Meccan conduit, through thousands of pilgrims having bathed in its sources on the day of 'Arafat. He is almost certain to be quarantined on his way—on Kamaran Island or at Tor or at some inland station—and frequently he will die in the odour of sanctity before he reaches his home.IX.—TRADE AND INDUSTRIES. 1.—Exports, Imports, and Products. Owing to the abnormality of the conditions which have obtained in Hejaz since the outbreak of the revolt, it is still best to state the position of trade in pre-war terms. The trade of Hejaz, and particularly of Jiddah, is created mainly by the needs of the pilgrimage, and, apart from the export of dates from some of the oases, consists almost entirely of imports. Mecca, the capital of Hejaz, has few natural advantages. From the first the town must have owed its importance to its position as a commercial centre of exchange, and to its possession of the most holy temple, stone and well of heathen sanctity, which were afterwards incorporated in the Mohammedan cult. Its barren soil is unproductive, and it possesses no local industries whatever; but goods are imported to it from all parts of the Orient. In its bazaars may be seen silks from Syria, carpets from Turkey and Persia and brass-work from India and Egypt, for which the pilgrims pay heavy prices compared with more accessible places. Traders from all parts of Islam bring their wares to Mecca and do profitable business. Jiddah, as the port of Mecca, is the trade-centre of Hejaz, and has become in consequence the most considerable place on the coast of the Red Sea. In normal times it maintains a regular volume of commerce, not only with other Arabian ports and with the Persian Gulf, but also with India, Egypt, and Africa, and, for certain classes of commodities, with Great Britain and Southern Europe. The great majority of the Mecca pilgrims arrive there by sea, and their transport and the supply of their wants constitute the chief business of the place. Many of its merchants, including a few Jews and Persians, and many Javanese, Hadhramis, and Egyp tians, are enterprising and wealthy. In addition to thesupply of Ihe pilgrims, Jiddah also imports for the settled population of Hejaz, and for much of West Central Arabia, though Medina now obtains a certain amount of goods by the Hejaz railway. In spite of its lack of facilities for the loading and unloading of cargo, Jiddah used to be, in normal peace-time, a regular place of call, twice monthly, for the British India Steamship Company's vessels ; and a French line of steamers and the vessels of the Austrian Lloyd touched there at irregular inter vals. It was also visited by vessels of the Oceanic Steamship Company, the Khedivial Mail Steamship Company, three British Indian Steamship Companies, the Turkish Mahsussah Transport Company, and by those of three Dutch companies. From March 1910 to March 1911 (the latest figures available) the number of vessels entering the port of Jiddah was 1,055, representing an aggregate of 656,632 tons. In 1910 the goods exported from Jiddah were valued at over £65,000, but in each of the two preceding years they were nearer £50.000 ; they consisted chiefly of sheep-skins, cow-hides, camel-hides, wood, henna, gum, mother-of-pearl shells, etc. The great export was specie, amounting, it appears, to considerably over £1,000,000 a year, the proceeds of the pilgrimage. No regular stock of coal was maintained ; and not more than a hundred and fifty tons of Welsh coal could be counted on at any time. As in the case of exports, no official statistics were obtain able for the imports of Jiddah, and hardly any information from local merchants. In 1910 it seems certain that about £90,000 was paid as import duties, which would give a little less than £1,000,000 worth (invoice value) of dutiable imports. To this total must be added goods imported from Ottoman ports, on which no duty was levied. According to one estimate the total yearly imports have been placed as high as £1,750,000 ; as exports were trifling in amount, the goods imported were for the most part paid for by the money of the pilgrims.— 93 — Imports consisted chiefly of grain, piece-goods, coffee, tea, sugar, flour, tobacco, spices, timber, carpets, crockery, and hardware. Under normal conditions the principal imports from the British Empire were rice and cereals from India, piece-goods from the United Kingdom (direct, or via Constantinople, Syria, or India), hardware and metals from India and the United Kingdom. Flour was nearly all from British India, though a little of superior quality was imported from Marseilles and Russia. Rice was from British India but of wheat only a small proportion was Indian ; nearly all was from Basra, the freights being light, whereas freights from Egypt were found prohibitive, w After the outbreak of war with I urkey, in November 1914, grain and foodstuffs (including dura from Egypt) continued to be imported , in accordance with the policy of the British Government, which intended them for the support of the pilgrims and the Arab population of the Hejaz. The action of the Turkish authorities in seizing this gram for the use of their troops led for a time to the stoppage of supplies. _ But, owing to the distress among the civil population m the Heiaz, the British Government permitted the importation of grain and foodstuffs to be resumed until May 1916 when all the sea-trade of Hejaz ports was once more stopped to be re-opened after the revolt in June. ' , A Early in 1917 the situation in regard to import ot, and local trade in, foodstuffs was this. Wheat, flour, and rice were reaching Hejaz from India alone, and their price depended on fluctuations of the Indian market. Special importation of wheat from Egypt {e.g. the annual present made by the Waqfs Administration to the Holy Places) had competed with Indian wheat for a while and kept down its price but India had resumed control. Rice was easily procurab e and comparatively cheap at Jiddah ; but in the coun ry districts, a scarce luxury. , . In dura and barley the Yemen suppty was competing with the Indian. Lentils, which used to come from Egypt, now came onlv from India, and were dear. Other dry Isi ir ■ li— ( Ji — vegetable foods were not procurable. But the situation was so far favourable that almost all cereals were sold in Jiddah at cheaper rates than in Cairo. Sugar came equally from India and Egypt (about one- third used to come direct from Europe) and was suf ficiently high-priced to cause great diminution in the con sumption of coffee and tea as luxuries, especially in public cafes. This diminution (curiously enough!) affected in turn the consumption of oil for lighting purposes, many cafes in the towns (the chief consumers) being either partly or wholly closed down ; but this reduction did not serve to lower the price of petroleum to anything like its pre-w^r rate, the import being very small and freights high. Wood for structural purposes has become scarce and dear, India, the only source of supply, being rendered almost powerless by lack of shipping to export bulky cargoes. For piece- goods, hardware, etc., Hejaz was drawing only on pre war stocks. As for exports, they had practically ceased, with the exception of untanned sheep-skins, still being sent to the opposite coast of the Red Sea by dhow. The pilgrimage conditions for the past two years have ont been such as to cause any accumulation of specie, and there have been no surplus dates to export, while considerable mili tary forces, which have been introduced from without, are demanding all, and more than all, the local supply. A share of the trade with Central Arabia used to be absorbed bv Yambo', the natural port for Medina and Nejd, and, although its commerce was of small importance com pared with that of Jiddah, the harbour was visited by Egyptian, British, Turkish, and Austrian steamers. The revenue of the port was derived exclusively from the customs, the duties being nominally fixed at ten per cent; the imports were mostly grain, coffee, and articles of clothing, ihe other places on the coast of Hejaz are of no commercial importance, and, with one exception, not ports of call for steamers ; at Lith, in Southern Hejaz, anAustrian Lloyd steamer used to call at intervals of about three months on her passage from Loheiyah and Qunfudah. Apart from its indispensable trade in provisions, Medina has never acquired the commercial importance that Mecca owes to the Hajj. For the pilgrimage to Medina is not compulsory, and only a small proportion of the Meccan pilgrims normally prolong their visit so as to include the Prophet's tomb, though visitors may come there at any time of the year. The town-population of Medina resembled that of Mecca in subsisting entirely on the pilgrimage and the Turkish subsidy; but the town also possesses a large agricultural population {see p. 21), and is a considerable source of local supply. The staple produce of Medina, as of all the oases of Hejaz, is the date. Of the numerous varieties grown there, the best class of date {shelebi) is packed in skins and boxes, and exported to all parts of the Mohammedan world. The helw date of el- 5 Ala, soft and tasting like honey, is also famous outside the limits of Hejaz ; it, too, is stored in skins, where it begins to dry and crystallize, and is exported in that form. A considerable proportion of the crop is carried to Syria, in part by the Syrian Hajj. The honey date of el- 'Ala is a favourite sweetmeat in Damascus. El-'Ala and the other oases are also great sources of date-supply to the Beduins, and they maintain some traffic with the latter in corn and imported rice. The chief traffic of Kheibar and Henakiyah is with Medina, merchants bringing their goods to the former oasis regularly for the autumn fair. The commercial connexions of Teima, on the other hand, run eastward, tradesmen from Jebel Shammar and Qasim arriving there with Baghdad clothing and the light and cheaper Gulf calico from Kuweit; coffee-pestles and mortars of limestone marble are also imported from Jauf. The only export of the oases, apart from dates and the small trade in cereals, is Teima rock-salt, which is used in all parts of Arabia ; it is said to be preferred to the sea-salt from Wejh and other coastal sources of supply.2.—currency. The recognized currency of Jiddah is the Turkish currency. It consists of the gold and silver piastre, the two, five, and ten-piastre pieces, the twenty-piastre piece or Mejidieh, and the Turkish Lira. The gold piastre does not exist as a token, but is the ex pression of a book or standard piastre value from which the silver piastre fluctuates. Thus the Turkish Lira=]08 gold piastres. Sovereign ==120 ,, ,, Napoleon = 90 „ „ Rupee . = 8 „ „ Any appreciation or depreciation from these standard values will be expressed in terms of silver piastres. Thus, for example, at the time of writing (February 1917):— The Turkish Lira Sovereign Napoleon Rupee In all outlying parts of the Turkish Empire, previous to the war, the official currency was supplemented and confused by the import and common use of foreign tokens. Just as in Irak, the Persian Kran, the Shahi, and the Maria Theresa dollar were common on the local market, so in the Hejaz the British sovereign, the rupee and its component silver units, the Maria Theresa dollar, the Dutch dollar, and the Egyptian ten-piastre piece were all more or less readily accepted in the coast towns and in Mecca, Medina, and Ta'if. This variety of currencies is generally due to the fact that the main population has no knowledge of Banks, but deals only with local money-lenders to whose speculative methods a heterogeneous currency affords = 125 silver piastres. = 140 „ = 106 „ = 9 „attractive opportunities for profit. In the Hejaz, however, the variety of currencies is even more due to the annual tide of pilgrims from all parts of the Moslem world who ebb again, leaving a silt of coins, imported with them from the countries from which they have come. This currency deposit is only partially got rid of by annual specie exports from the Hejaz. Since the war the only foreign currencies of any importance are the rupee, the four and two-anna pieces, and in a far smaller degree, the Egyptian ten-piastre piece. Of these the rupee and the anna pieces are so popular that they have an importance in the country that bids fair to rival the official currency itself. 3.—weights and Measures. In Mecca, Medina, and their ports, Turkish weights and measures are largely employed, but not to the exclusion of native standards. At Medina and in all the oases of the Hejaz the measure most commonly employed is the sah, which varies considerably in content in different places. According to Doughty the sah is the equivalent of nearly two pints at Teima, nearly three pints at el- c Ala, and five pints at Kheibar ; at Ha'il he reports it is two pints and a half. The other measures in use, as given by Doughty, are the following :— A medega (a small palm-basket), the equivalent of twelve sahs ; and a mejellad, the equivalent of five medegas. At Medina and elsewhere in Hejaz a skin of dates is called hashiyah. Large bargains in dates are reckoned by camel- loads. The measure of length in Hejaz, as in other parts of Arabia, appears to be the actual cubit, the distance from a man's elbow to the point of his middle finger. According to doughty a ' palm-rod ' (length not stated) is employed at Kheibar as a larger lineal measure, the repair of an orchard- wall being reckoned and paid for by the palm-rod.— 98 — X.—COMMUNICATIONS. The presence of the goals of the Mussulman pilgrimage in Hejaz causes tracks to converge upon it from all quarters. It alone among Arabian districts can be reached from the outside world by railway {see Hejaz Railway, Route No. 12). The points towards which all main tracks are directed are Medina and Mecca ; but account must be taken also of some which make inland from the coast to points on the Hejaz railway north of Medina, and of coastal linking routes. The tracks come from the centre (Ha'il, Qasim, or Riyadh), from the north (Syria and Egypt), from the west coast and from the south (Asir and Yemen). None of these reaches Mecca or Medina without crossing some desert and more steppe, and, except between Jiddah and Mecca and along the coast line, all encounter hilly country and some difficult mountain passes. In general, the Hejaz routes are among the least safe in the Arabian peninsula from nomad attack. 1. — N orthern C oastal R outes. There are cross-routes running from the ports of Muwei- lah, Wejh, Umlej, and Yambo', to points on the Hejaz railway. The southernmost of these is the best known, that from Yambo' to Medina (Route No. 6). The tracks from Akaba to Ma/an (Route No. 1) hardly fall properly in Hejaz ; but they may be included here, because of the strategic importance of Akaba in relation to sea-control of the Hejaz coasts and that of Ma/an in relation to railway access from the north. The tracks encounter no very serious natural difficulties, though they have to climb well over 4,000 feet, and they have sufficient water for small parties at not excessive intervals. One track has been(s*) — 99 — roughly surveyed by the Turks for a projected branch-railway and is followed by a telegraph wire. But, under ordinary circumstances, this is an unsafe road, crossing as it does the main lines of passage which are taken by marauding parties, into and out of Sinai, particularly by the treacherous Huweitat The track traverses, between Wadi c Arabah and the Hismah plain, a succession of steep valleys and much broken ground where enemy parties are difficult to detect from a distance. Shakespear shows in his diary that he was more apprehensive of attack on his passage from the Hismah to the western side of Wadi Arabah than anywhere else in his journey across Arabia. Where so many ill-knit sub-tribes converge, and so many travelling parties from distant tribes may *be met, it is almost impossible to secure a partv by means of rafiqs. No supplies can be obtained en route. The track southward from Akaba (Route No. 2) is the Egyptian Hajj route, and, as such, has been provided with wells at all stages ; but since it has ceased to be followed by the Mahmal, or by any large bodies of pilgrims under official escort, the wells and rest-stations have ^fallen into decay, especially on the Midian coast. Otherwise, it offers easy going, and as far as ^ambo' is comparatively safe from any but irresponsible footpads. From ^ ambo onwards, security depends on the attitude of the Zobeid Harb. It traverses, in succession, territories of the Huweitat-Beni Atiyah, the Billi, the Juheinah, and the Harb, and previous arrangements must be made with all of these tribes. Supplies of simple foodstuffs, forage, and fuel are obtainable en route at Muweilah, Wejh, Umlej, Yambo', Rabugh, and several villages between the last named and Mecca. The cross-track from the Midian coast at Muweilah to Tebuk on the Hejaz railway (Route No. 3) has only once been followed by a European traveller (Wallin in 1847), though Burton also saw something 'of the country through \\hich the western half of it runs. But it was used regularly by the Turks for the passage of small bodies of regular and irregular troops to and from the coast during the— 100 — present war. It is not specially difficult, though it crosses high ground (to 6,000 feet) ; but it is very ill-supplied with watering places, affords no supplies beyond camel- grazing, and, m the Hisma, is exposed to attack by the ill-reputed MiVza clan. The latter clan (and to some extent also the Huweitat) controls it. Little is known of the two inland tracks from Wejh to el- 'Ala and Medina respectively (Routes Nos. 4 and 5), though Euting followed the first in the reverse direction in 1884; and several parties, including Germans, used it in 1915- 1916 ; and nothing useful can be said, as yet, of those from Umlej to Istabl c Antar andMedina. Besides what is said in the description of Routes Nos. 4 and 5, it need only be stated that they lie through very lean steppe-country, ill-watered and ill-supplied, and that the Billi tribe controls them till within a few hours of el- r Ala. With a raftq f om that tribe they are fairly safe. The Umlej routes lie through Juheinah territory. The Yambo'-Medina road (Route No. 6), follows more than one track, especially in the western part, where that chosen depends on the attitude of this or that clan of the Juheinah Arabs. In the eastern part, after the route has fallen, near Hamra, into the Darb es-Sultani (Route No. 9), it runs through Harb territory (mainly Beni Salim section) and is protected very inadequately by block houses. This part is the most dangerous owing to the Harb clans. The route is much travelled, because the insecure tracks between Mecca and Medina are more shunned than used; and pilgrims arriving at Medina by the Hejaz railway often prefer, and sometimes are obliged, to go down to Yambo' and continue their journey by sea to Jiddah. Similarly, after the Mecca pilgrimage, many, who wish to visit Medina also, reverse the same process rather than risk a caravan-journey between the towns. But even the Yambo'-Medina road is far from safe, as well as very ill-watered and arduous, owing to the broken mountainous character of the country on the last half of it.— 101 — f . There are rest stations and sma.ll suqs on the eastern part 0 f the road, where scanty supplies of foodstuffs ran be ^0. obtained, forage and fuel are not difficult to procure in small quantities. ttUyJ 2.—S outhern C oastal R outes. ffejlti;. Concerning the tracks from Rabugh to Medina and Jiddah, 1 atiii all under Harb control, nothing can usefully be said beyond (feotir what is given in the schematic descriptions of those iitiillj routes (q.v.). tloseif On the other hand we have ample detail about the Jiddah- issaiiiitt Mecca road (Route No. 7). It is the most travelled track Jybv in Arabia, protected by blockhouses at intervals, and well J-nfej supplied with halt-stations. The first few miles lie over ilsfter sandy plain ; after which the track passes through a range of ntktfc low hills to the plain of Bahrah. Thence it leads over dusty til# undulating country to the Main Ridge of West Arabia, in a foothill valley of which, running north-east into the range, lies oloup the Holy City at a mean altitude of not more than 700 feet, wfe; A carriage could pass with difficulty over this track, and dacoij continue by the northern (Seil) route to Ta'if (sixty-five miles as the crow flies, but over 100 by this route; see p. 103); but it is not the practice to use carriages on the Jiddah road, although guns have often been wheeled over it. Mecca donkeys are the best riding animals for this road, and very good animals can do the journey in six to seven hours. The track is unmade, unmetalled and unbanked ; but it has been trodden to a very fair surface, and is not interrupted by natural obstacles. A motor-car could probably pass over it all. The coastal track from Jiddah to Lith (Route No. 8), the first part of the Tihamah route to Asir and Yemen, has not been traversed by any European explorer, except the Emden'paiTtj in 1915. It is scantily supplied with halting places and wells of bad water and passes through very barren and sandy tracts. The Zobeid Harb, the Juhadlah, fil— 102 — and still more the Dliawi Hasan further to the south render it unsafe. 3.—I nland R outes. Three tracks, at least (with variants), are used by pilgrims between Medina and Mecca :— (а) Darb esh-Sharqi, lying farthest inland, and crossing patches of harrah (Route No. 10). (б) Gaha and Fura group, mountain tracks with regular wells ; fairly safe ; and the most direct, but not winter routes. Little used (Route No. 9). (c) Darh es-Sultdni, the most travelled, but longest route (Route No. 9). The Fura and Gaha tracks appear as pendants to Route No. 9. All three routes traverse much mountainous country, but little or no sand desert. The Darh es-Sultdni (Route No. 9), is the only one protected at points by blockhouses, and supplied with roadside markets and coffee-shops. Between Medina and Rabugh the same line is not always followed, it being often advisable to avoid this or that clan of the Harb, which holds the country along two-thirds of the route. Not infrequently all roads between Medina and Mecca have been closed by the action of this tribe. The Darb es-Sultani runs through rugged hills from Bir 'Ah to Wastaand through oases in Wadi Safrah; but for the rest, it lies in the main in thin sandy, but not unfertile, country, until Wadi Fatimah is reached. On or near its line was to run the projected extension of the Heiaz railway, whose construction the Harb tribesmen have successfully frustrated hitherto. The Harb fear the loss of the gains, legitimate and illegitimate, which they derive from the passage of pilgrim caravans, while the Emir of Mecca used to fear the rivetting of the Ottoman hold on Hejaz.— 108 — Supplies of foodstuffs can be obtained, but not in abun dance, on all these pilgrim routes, the suqs at Hamra, Rabugh, etc., being very small and poor affairs. Forage is fairly plentiful in spring, and fuel can be gathered from the frequent and general bush-vegetation. Water presents no difficulty. The direct route from Ta/ifto Mecca (Route No. 11) is dealt with in sufficient detail under that head. The last part of it is the annual pilgrimage road to 5 Arafat and apt to be raided by the Hudheil and by miscellaneous footpads. The longer track, which alone could be used by wheeled traffic, follows Route No. 17, as far as Ria es-Seil (70 miles) and thence strikes south up Wadi Seil, and turning the flank of Jebel Qora, reaches Ta/if about fifty miles further on. Doughty followed the last part in 1878. About Route No. 12, the Hejaz Railway, nothing need be said here, beyond the fact that the train service is precarious, and that in succession, the Huweitat, Beni Atiyah, Billi, Juheinah, Fuqara, /Aida, and Harb (Beni 'Ali) tribesmen can secure it or interrupt it. A peculiar difficulty arises from the fact that, out of nearly forty halts, there is no natural water supply except at the following stations : Qal'at el-Mudawwarah, Dhat el-Hajj, Bir Hurmas, Tebuk, QaFat el-Akhdar, Meda/in Salih, El- 'Ala, Hadiyah, and Bueir. The rest of the stations depend on supply brought by the trains, and only in a few intances have supplementary cisterns, fed by a very small preci pitation. 4.—C entral R outes. Though tracks leading eastward to Central Arabia, or vice versa, are not, strictly speaking, Hejaz routes, it is well to include them in this Handbook, since their character and practicability have an obvious strategic bearing on Hejaz. They all pass, in the main, through fairly well watered steppe country, which admits of detours from the direct line— 104 — in all directions. Consequently different informants more often describe different routes between the same points in this region than anywhere else, their devious courses having been determined by the presence of camps here and there, and by the comparative security of the country on one side or the other of the direct line, from Harb or 'Ateibah raiders. The most travelled tracks, the routes of the Persian pilgrimage from Ha'il to Medina and Mecca respectively, are the least known to us, simply because, as Shiah pilgrim tracks, they are not favourable avenues for Christian travel lers. That from Medina to Ha il (Route No. 14) was fol lowed in the reverse direction by Wallin in 1845, but beyond recording that he traversed it in eighty-five hours fast marching he has left no account of his journey. Like all the routes to the centre, it encounters its main physical difficulties in its early stages, when it crosses the harrah country which lies in the east of Hejaz. It is subject to Harb raids. It was attempted unsuccessfully in autumn, 1904, by a Turkish force bound for Ha'il, which had to turn back after much suffering from lack of sufficient water in the wells and the opposition of the Harb. The only points near its line where a large force could halt and recruit are the oasis of Kheibar, about seventy miles north of Medina, and Henakiyah. The direct road from Mecca to Ha'il (Route No. 16) has been seen by no European south of Mustajiddah (near to which point Guarmani came in 1864 and Doughty wandered in 1877) ; and, as of Route No. 14, nothing more can be said of it in particular than appears in the schematic de scription at the end of this volume. It also is much raided by the Harb. Doughty says of it (ii-52) : ' From Hayil to Mecca are 500 miles at least, over vast deserts, which they pass in fifteen long marches, not all year journeying by the same landmarks, but according to that which is reported of the waterings—which are wells of the Aarab—and of the peace— 105 — or dangers of the wilderness before them. Ibn Rashidi Hajj have been known to go near by Kheybar, but they com monly hold a course from Mustajiddah or the great watering of Semira, to pass east of the Harrat el-Kesshub, and from thence in other two days descend to the underlying Mecca country by Wadi Laymun,' This would mean a detour somewhat to the east of a straight line drawn between Mecca and Ha/il. The tracks from Medina and Mecca to Qasim are in only little better case. That from Medina (Route No. 15), though traversed by several Europeans during the Wahabite war of 1817-1819, has not been described in detail by any of these travellers. It has been covered by considerable regular forces more than once; by the Egyptian army in 1817-1818, and by four Turkish battalions under Sidki Pasha in late winter 1905. The remnants of these straggled back from Qasim a year later stripped of arms, accoutrements, and shoes. The track from Mecca (Route No. 17) is known only from Doughty's and Huber's journeys, on alternative lines for most of the distance, the main pilgrimage route (Darb es- Sultani) remaining unseen. Since, however, it is a section of the greatest trans-peninsular route and the alternative lines are almost as much in use as the main pilgrim road, it merits more particular mention here. As followed from Mecca, it is a single route till about thirty miles north-east of ' Asheirah, where the Darb es-Sultani, the pilgrims' road to Bureidah, diverges to the left. Farther on, about Um el- Masha'aib, the route forks once more, thet wo branches (the left Doughty's, the right Huber's) uniting again near Anei- zah. There are thus three alternatives for part of the way. The tracks traverse for the most part lava-fields and desert steppe, which slope generally very slightly to the north-east, at a mean altitude, till they reach Qasim, of about 4,000 feet. The Darb es-Sultani is said to be well provided with water. Elsewhere watering places are fairly numerous, but water is usually scanty and poor. There is not much, apparently, to— 106 — choose in the matter of length ; each of the three routes appears to be about 450 miles. It is difficult to compare these routes; two of them have been adequately described by Huber and Doughty respect ively ; the Darb es-SuItani has not been seen by any European. This latter would seem to be the easiest of the three, having most permanent water and reaching inhabited places in the direction of Qasim sooner than do the others. On the other hand, both Doughty's and Huber's parties were caravans of traders, not explorers, and therefore must have followed lines of little resistance. Perhaps they avoided the pilgrim route because it traverses the country of the predatory Harb, although, in so doing, they got into the country of the hardly less formidable 'Ateibah. Of the track to Riyadh, which coincides with the above for 300 miles, no more need be said than that it is the Wahabite pilgrimage road and that its intermediate stages have been travelled by no European. They seem, however, to present no difficulties, fairly large and well-supplied settlements occurring all along the line through Woshm. Supplies. —On all this group of tracks, foodstuffs, beyond an occasional animal for slaughter, are unprocurable, and only in spring would there be any forage except for camels. Fuel, however, of the scrub kind, is fairly abundant. Water, as has been said, is usually sufficient and sweet.Route No. 1.—AKABA to MA'AN.

Authority: For this route, linking North Hejaz and Qasim, there is no recent authority. What follows is deduced from Sadlier's narrative, 1819, compared with an itinerary given by Burckhardt and reports of French officers in Ibrahim Pasha's service in the Wahabite war. General Direction : East-north-east. Distance: Crowfly, 260 miles; road, 285 miles(?). Miles. MEDINA. Direction north-east. Cross plain ; route follows first a valley then a mountain road; after about fifty miles descend into a ravine among high hills ; trees and water. Leave ravine, enter a valley, thence across a plain with some vegetation. Cross the bed of Wadi Hamdh. Hendkiyah, village ; about forty houses in Wadi Hamdh. Forage and good wells, sixty to ninety feet. (In 1818,800 cavalry, 900 infantry and three guns halted here for twenty-five days.) 25 miles. Cross low range of hills. Direction east-north-east generally through isolated rocky hills. 25 miles. Valley running north-west to south-east, with some wells. 28 miles. Jehel Mdwiyah.

Water obtained by digging after rain. Route north-east follows a torrent bed, then crosses gravelly plain to Wddi el-Miyah. Liable to inundation. Regular halting place at wells of Bajir, west-south-west. Route crosses, first, sandhills, then a gravelly plain with scattered bushes, bounded south by rocky hills to Jirzawiyah. Wells in a hollow. Cross first a line of hills running north and south, passing through a grassy valley, then a plain. Route runs north-east to Ed-Das. Wells. Route north-east crosses the plain. 15 miles. Matta (enclosure with a few families of cultivators ; wells ; two deserted hamlets). Skirt rocky hills (Jebel Abanat?) to RASS, the first large settlement in Qasim. Ihe above distances can be regarded as approximate only. They are based on the time apparently taken by Sadlier, and on the assumption that his pace was generally two and a quarter miles an hour. The posi tion in Hunter's map of Hanakiyah, Jebel Mawiyah, Batin el-Urmah, and Jirzawiyah, also rest on this hypothesis. Burckhardt's itinerary gives the time from Medina to Rass as 105 hours, exclusive of halts. His pace appears to have been, in general, about two and a quarter miles per hour. The distance to be inferred from his time does not therefore differ much from that which has been deduced from Sadlier.
