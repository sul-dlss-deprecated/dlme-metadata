Humphrys* telegram of 11th January, No.9, on P.Z.384/34. (h) The opinion recorded hy the Law Officers in their letter of 23rd January, on P.Z.576/34, on the proh&amp;hiiity or success In tne event of H.Ivi.er. taKing tne irUQi Govern- ment to arhitration 2. As regards Baghdad telegram on P.Z.584, I inclined personally to think that the solution f'avour/hy Sir F. Humphrys has much to he said for it (the suggestion that H.M.G. should finance it apart). If carried through, iWi it would put tne .Sheikh’s title to tne date gardens heyord question arid it would avoid a parliamentary discussion which might he embarrassing to tne new King and which could hardly fail to provoke criticism of H.M.G. ana their action 1/ in endeavouring to saddle Iraq with obligations in respect of the two .Sheikhs. In the last resort it would r -however^ ^ tit L / Hr t ^ P r ° lD n.51y he worth the while of H.M.G. to add £2,000 to tt whatever compensation they may have to pay in respect of ^ ' if' sU 4. ^ J relinquishment of the exemption as the price oi | A tkr satisfactorily establishing the title. But the Treasury will probably wish, before going so far as this, to make an &gt;/,&lt; effort to persuade the Iraqi Government to pay* 3. For the circumstances in which the reference to the Law Officers was made please see paragraph 27 of the record of trie interdepartmental conference of 12th June 1933 on P.Z.3848/33 flagged. The reference itself is flagged/© 4 - - 2 - £&gt; O' flagged on P.Z.7750/33. Hie opinion is satisfactory so Lcxv fat b it; bO s b, in liict©, on l. 01 in in. nssuiiipiionsj whicii msiy be acceptea, it is definitely to the effect that in the event of an a rh it rat ion the Iraqi Government are likely to he held to he houna to implement the undertakings given to the Sheikns of Koweit and Iviohamine rah • It appears further, that our position has, if anything, been strengthened hy the not altogether satisfactory exchange of correspondence in regard to these obligations which took place in connection with the Treaty of 1930. 4. On a relatively minor point, we need not object to their view that in the event of arbitration it might be neither desirable nor logical to include in the reference the question whether or not the Sheikn of Koweit, as an independent sovereign, should hold the properties immune from taxation. expressed in paragraph 3 by the Law z/r officers is noteworthy and goes rather farther^ than they /fa ^ jo o. ^uve been inclined to in the past. , The proposed discussion with the Foreign Office’,/ ■ . will, I understand, be primarily on Sir Francis Humpnrys £ *■ rCv&gt; suggestions in the light of the Lav/ Officers* opinion. of compensation for the Sheikhs in respect oi any r un abanuonment of their claim to exemption may also come up. ^ ^ On this point we can, I think, stand on the suggestions t r ac.-\ /'Z'Z +r, made in my letter of 26th October last, No.P.Z*6861/3o, wj 3 ', /*y/ the Foreign Office. For the rest, there seems nothing lor it but to be guided by the course of the discussion. Any conclusions reached by the meeting must be provisional and subject to submission to higher authority. u 7c.

The force o the different arguments suggested in the reference to our predecessors must deuend upon the setting in which those arguments are presented. If the (Jovemment of Iraq can he persuaded to submit the question to arbitration under a special agreement drafted in the widest possible terms as suggested, ve are of opinion that there is considerable force in the arguments suggested in paragraph 5 of the Colonial Office letter of May 17th 1930 addressed to our predecessors, and particularly in the second suggested argument. The arguments eopear to us to derive additional force from the list of British international obiigat ? ne in respect of Iraq mentioned In the Memorandum drawn up at the time of the abortive negotiations for a Treaty in 1927 and also from trie letter to which we have previously r ferred in this Opinion from the High Oomml ssioner® to the Iraqi Prim# Minister of October 18th 1930.(3) Generally we think that in default of afreement a reference to arbitration, even 1:' the result was unfavourable, might improve His Majesty 1 s Qoremment'® position with regard to claims for compensation by the Sheikhs. It would help to show that His Majer.ty’s ! Government had used its best endeavours to get the pr.'mises implemented by the State having sovereignty over the territories; and on one view this may be the full extent of tie promises made, r.s the undertakings were clearly wo think co tingent on the British Government having the power as a result of the far to implement them.

My dear Fowle, Please refer to your confidential despatch No. C/191 of November 24th, forwarding a copy of a despatch from Kuwait about the taxation of the date gardens of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in Iraq. The 'very positive- opinions expressed by the Baerah lawyer of the Shaikh of Kuwait are such mischievous nonsense that T feel they cannot be allowed to pass without corrment. jar. Gabriel asserts positively that the Iraqi Government completely changed their entire revenue system throughout Iraq, necessitating the introduction of extensive new and complicated machinery and the scrapping °i -he whole of the previous revenue system so laboriously built up on the Turkish pattern since the days of the Occupation, in order to obliterate the comparatively ■-■rifling revenue exemptions enjoyed by the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in respect of their gardens in Iraq. There was in fact no need for the Irani Government to use heavy artillery to kill what is, in their eyes, a very small bird. They have always consistently maintained that,the promise o^ His Majesty 1 s Government that the Shaikhs should enjoy their property free of taxation was n °t binding on the Iraqi Government and that they were at /at Lieut.-colonel T.C.W. Fowle, C.B.E.liberty to collect revenue from them. They had only to issue an ordei to one local Shaikhs and the deed was done. Such an order in fact had already been issued in 19si and had been postponed at my request f or on e year only. They had every intention of enforcing recovery thereafter and could easily have done so. « Ii.r • Gabriel is positive that now that they have made f uhe Shaikhs toe the line ,T the Iraqi Government will go to all the trouble of scrapping their ne?i/ machinery and reverting to the old system, thereby rendering nugatory all the preparation ana labour which has been expended upon the change. It is incorrect to say that the Iraqi Govern ment are losing heavily in their revenue collections since the introduction of the Istihlak system. it was anticipated that the administrative relief given to the cultivators and land-owners might result in a small drop in receipts and provision was made accordingly. Revenue collections are well up to expectation, the budget is balanced, and there i no financial necessity for the re-introduction of the old system of land-taxation. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter, together with a copy of your despatch under reference, to Qliphant, and hope we shall soon be able to get this tiresome case satisfactorily settled.

As I told you by telephone, we have had no official reply♦ But in a personal letter of the 16th November to Oliphant, Humphrys says that he has got a scheme for safeguarding the Sheikh’s ownership in the gardens once for all. He does not disclose the details of this scheme, hut states that they have been privately accepted by the King and Nuri Pasha, as they were by the late Prime Minister. The execution of the plan has been delayed by the change of Cabinet in November, but Humphrys sees no reason why the new Cabinet should bach out, more especially as Nuri is its most influential member. ov AIR MAlU 3# COPY SENT B J.G.

Shaikh* s Date Gardens in * Iraq. ) sir, I have the honour to report that In a recent conversation which I had with Mr ♦Gabriel, the legal representative of Hi* Excellency the shaikh of Kuwait in * Iraq, the latter gave it as his very positive opinion that the 'Istahlak” Law had bean originally introduced by the f Iraq Government mainly in order to enable then to*get ot f the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in the matter of their large properties on the Shatt al Arab, ^lich were exempt from taxation. 8. Mr. Gab riel was equally positive that as soon as they (the 1 Iraq Government) could conveniently do so, without raising too big an outcry against themselves, especially from His Majesty's Government, they would revert again to the old Turkish system of Land Tax i.e. the •Khums* or 80 ^ of the crop system, i&amp;ich used to be assessed on standing crops by measurement, and on date gardens by the *Jarib* or acreage calculation. 3. Mr#Gabriel when challenged by me ^ to his reasons for assuming i3iat there would be such a change, replied (a) that th© 'Iraq Government were definitely losing son® 15/80 lacs of revenue (rupees) under the Istahlak system, and could not possibly oaitinue to lose this amount forfor ever: (b) That they bad foreseen this loss from the first, but counted it worth while, provided they could get the Shaikhs of J ohamraerah and Kuwait to f toe the line* and pay taxes: (c) That he (Mr.Gabriel) had certain very good underground sources of information as to the Central Cksverument f s in tentions, which had not yet played him false, from these he had deduced that the change would inevitably come. 4. Mr. Gab riel pointed out that His Majesty* s Government would do well to consider the above possibility carefully, if it were ever their intention to compensate the Shaikhs in question, by capitalising future revenues due, by giving them a lump sum derm, the interest on which would go towards meeting their obligations to the * Iraq Government. The ^olnt being that under such plan it would be quite un fair to assess the future revenues due from the Shaikhs, on amounts paid under the Istablek system, as this came to con siderably less (nearer half of what they would have to pay under the Turkish system of ’al Khums*, if the latter were reintroduced). The only fair calculation, said Mr.Gab riel, and the only acceptable one to both Ghaikhs would be on the revenue that was paid to the Turks, receipts for which were, in the case of the Khaikh of Kuwait certainly extant and carefuly filed. 5# Curiously enough the Ghalkh himself mentioned the same thing to me seme 9 months ago, and at the time I drew your attention to the ioatter. 6. The point is an interesting and Important one, I think, in view of the^opinlon which was expressed sometime bad by Sir^Francis Humphrys (endorsed by you at the time, as far as I remember) that once a settlement by compensatory methods were decided on by His Majesty’s Government, and. the amount fixed, such settlement would have to be considered as final, and neither of the Shaikhs would be at liberty- 0 In any further communication on this subject, please quote \ No. /f yof&amp;s ifo#, and address —not to any persm by na/u, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. 7750 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Af^^^iisents i mmm ijhAbj '** compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop^ of the under-mentioned paper.

The circumstances in which it is desired to make the present reference are given in paragraph 27 of the record of an interdepartmental meeting held at tne Foreign Office on 12th June 1933, on P.Z.3848/33 flagged. reference is generally suitable, though I shall be glad to know whether you concur in the Foreign Office suggestion (paragraph 7 of the draft) that it is doubtful whether an argument based on the international status of the Sheikh would be applicable to the Istihlds tax except in so far as it is levied on date gardens which never ceased to be his property. modification may be desirable also arises out of the second part of paragraph 7. The Sheikh did in fact allow a suit to be brought against him in respect of his Basiliyah property without apparently challenging the jurisdiction of the courts on the grounds of his sovereign status. But there is also in issue a much more important property, viz. that known as the Faddaghiyeh property. While various efforts have 3.33 been/ 4. The minor point on which I think some slightm | been made to serve a summons on dm m respect of this he has so far contrived to evade them, ana it is prohahle that,if and when it should prove impossible any longer to continue to do so, he will be advised to accept service only under protest ana after making a reservation in respect of ms sovereign rights. tS*' r V ' . . y. t d-^ r\ C-T ^-&lt;_ - i-^* ^ a, * '4—C— /C-&lt; ^7 A &amp; 4m I r 7r y^. / ^{&lt;&lt;7 3Z fmt.

We agree generally (subject to any comments which the Treasury may have to make and the remarks that follow) in the draft referen ce &lt;hEJ3ut we suggest, in the light of comments by our Legal Adviser, that in lines 12-13 of para.7 the draft as it stands gives perhaps an unnecessarily definite lead in one direction, and that it might be reworded to read ” in 1930, and levied in a different manner It is for consideration whether any contention based on the international status of the Sheikh could be supported in the case of... 3. Is it not the case as regards the second part of para.7 that the Sheikh has compromised his position only in respect of the Bashiyah property ? The Iraqis have not yet succeeded in effecting service on him in respect of the Faddaghiyeh property and if our efforts to keep this case out of the courts were to prove fruitless and it were to be necessary 1925 5000 6.33necessary to advise the Sheikh to accept service in respect of it we should, I think, be disposed, subject j to the concurrence of the other interested departments, to advise him to accept service only after specifically pleading and then waiving (if the Iraqis refused to accept it) a claim to exemption fran jurisdiction on the ground o- nis sovereign status. His submission to the jurisdiction in the case of Bashiyah may 'be relevant. But it is an isolated incident which cannot in our view carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years, much less operate as a 'bar for ever from raising the question of sovereignty.

For the purposes of this reference. Sir John fimon thinks that it may he assumed that the Iraqi Government would agree to the question being referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, hut a© Iraq has not signed the Optional Clause, the reference would have to be by specie agreementagreement and not by 8 unilateral ostlon (aee Article 40 of the sta- written applt- thlB purpo^ would of course bc^ a tor ftegotlatloti with tbe Iraqi Oovern'nt ntj but Simon would be glad to know whether, In existing circumstances, you agree with the view expressed by your predeeeaaors in 19^0 that any reference to the Permanent Court should, ii possible, be framed In the widest possible terms so as to cower ell the grounds on which It might be held that the obligation to implement the undertakings given by Mis Majesty’s Qoverrm ni to the two Sheikhs haa devolved on the Iraqi Government. 5# The question then arises whether those grounds h?ive been affected by th aevetopments which have occurred since 19ZK As stated above, the relevant provision of the 1950 treaty la the second paragraph of Article 8, which re places Article 1 of tht 19ai treaty. Paragraph &amp; of the reference by the Colonial Office to i/ before these negotiation* are opened Sir John yourshows your predecessors, dated May 17th, 1900 , that while the undertakings given by Mi® Majesty's Government to the two Sheikhs were mentioned to the Iraqi Government after the signature of the 19B2 treaty, they were not included In the list o the commitments reierred to in Article 10; and paragraph 4 of the same reference states whet occurred in regard to these undert©kings in connexion with the abortive treaty of 192?* After the signature of the 19to treaty, but before its submission to the Iraqi Parliament, the Briti h High Commissioner in Iraq addressed a note (Paper E) to the Iraqi Prime Minister in which he referred to the method to be adopted for dealing with these commitments of His Majesty*a Govemm nt in the list of International obligations devolving upon Iraq under Article 8 of the new treaty, and he proposed, in the event of certain negotiations for the possession of the sheikhs* properties not having reached finelity before the communication of this list to the IraqiC*1 Article 10 or th&lt; 198S treaty, and while the eoasunlcatlon made in 19a? was In connexion with negotiations for a new treaty which has never come into force, the ohligations m question were included in the list off to tally communicated to the T ra 1 Government of the commitments devolving on Iraq under Article 8 of the 1980 treaty.

We are glad to note from the letter in question that the Treasury are prepared to consider, without prejudice to the issue of principle, the basis on which compensation in respect of tax exemption could be paid in the event of compensation being ultimately agreed upon. 3. We agree in the first place with the opinion expressed by Humphrys at 1 the meeting of 12th June that now that the Law Officers have advised that a definite obligation rests on H.M.G. to compensate the Sheikhs in respect of any imposition of the Istihlak tax on the produce of those of their date gardens covered by the undertaking of 1914 the payment made by H.IW.G. should be a sum directly related to their losses. 4. Secondly, in considering the basis of compensation it seems important/(2)/ important to tear in minci that oho exemption promised in 1914 was in terms perpetual and without limit oi time,or,save to the extent that it is confined to the descendants of ohdikh Mubarak of Koweit, ana to “yourself ana for your successors from among your male descendants” in the case Q-l the Sheikh of Mohammerah^ beneficiary. The Sheikhs of Koweit remain independent rulers, but the Sheikh of Mohammerah has relapsed into subjecticn to Persia and it is conceivable that he will have no '’successor” in the special and semi-independent feudal ustances which we can, I thinK, asonably claim to have had in mina _in entering into the engagement of 1914. This fact is relevant to the question of the basis of compensation I which is discussed below. : 5. For convenience, I deal in the [first instance with the position of the Sheikh of Koweit. Bie^alternative open appear to us to be (1) the payment annually of a sum sufficient from time to time-to indemnify the Sheikhs in respect of any annual payment which they may have to make to Iraq despite the ooligations entered into by us in 1914. H.L.G. shimlTg remain liable for such payments so long as the descendants oi Sheikh Mubarak hold the gardens covered by the 1914 pledge.Draft Paper. -O ^ U^Ua^jl vv#^ ccr Department. (2) A corresponding payment for the lifetime of the present Sheikh only. (3) The capitalisation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption (? 23 years' purchase or thereabouts) of the present cost of tiie exemption^am the payment thence annually^rof the proceeds^ Ok (4) Payment to the aieikh ot an immediate lump sum representing the A * r- I I * f 4 ^ V ^ the hheikh thereafter he coming liable lor such taxation as the Iraq Government might impose on his property in common with other similar properties, andH.M.G.’s obligation under the 1914 pledge being finally liquidated. 6. Woods at the meeting of 12th June made it clear that there would be strong Parliamentary objections to any annual grant and I think we should all agree as to this. The India Office, I think, feel strongly that having regard to the terms of aAt »-v»y _ the original grant we cannot,rlnthe case of the Sheikh of Koweit,regard our obligation as discharged merely by tne indemnifying of the present Sheikh uuring his lifetime in respect of demands of the nature covered by tne 1914 pledge from Iraq. The position in the case of tie Sheikh of 1925 5000 6.33 Mohammerah/j ifetuuimeraii may be ratiier different. • His expectation of life very small and, as suggestedfaBove, I i the position may enable us with a ' clear conscience to regard our j liability as discharged on his death. | 7. subject to further discussion with you ana the Treasury we should, I think, at the moment rather be inclined to suggest that the best course in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit woula be capitalisation on the basis)of the value of a perpetual eruption and the payment thence annually of the proceea&amp;f ' AS 'WEH* pointed out at the meeting &lt;^tirere is some advantage in a procedure of this nature, it avoids the necessity of returning to Parliament year after and year fx a grant to the Sheikh;/it gives us an additional hold over the Sheikh, since if he behaves badly it will be open to us to withhold payment in any particular year. But it raises certain points which you will no doubt consider. The first is whether tte capitalised value of a perpetual exemption is lik.ely to produce a revenue markedly below the burden imposed at trie moment on the Sheikhs in respect of Iraqi denarius. As you know, the present scalefis” relatively favourable to us, but it seems desirable that arrangement we come to should, at any rate in the first/1925 5000 6.33 9 / V Draft Paper, Department. ^ 1 first year or so, fully meet the ^ uemanas against the Sheikh, o. Seconaly, will such a payment oe payable every year, irrespective of whether the Sheikh In fact has to make any payment to Iraq or not? ihis point is not too easy. On the one hand, the Sheikh can reasonably claim not to have the worst of both worlds. In other words, if the annual payment made to him is, say, ior the sake of argument, £&amp;, and his payment in three successive years to 4 the Iraq Govt, is X plus 1,000, he \&gt; coula reasonably claim that if in the . fourth year tne Iraq Govt, abolished the tax altog^' ^ there was some one Ir case for the nuance of payment ^the- at the rate of £X by H.L.G. fora certain further period. On the other 5 hand, we ao not, of course, wish to saddle ourselves with an indefinite payment in compensation for payments out by the Sheikh which he has in fact ceased to make. A possible compromise on this would be that we should inform the Sheikh that in the event of tne Iraq Govt, ceasing to levy tax for a period say of 3 years j consecutively, the question of the j payment under our guarantee would need reconsideration.•.M rfurt 9. As regards the Sheikh of Mohaianerah, we can deal with the matter either on the oasis of indemnification during his lifetime in respect of payments Oy the Iraq Govt, or, as in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit, on the Oasis of an annual pajmnt tosed on tte capitalised wl® of Ills exemption. But 1 think we should, he disposed in this case definitely to favour re-examination on the death of the present Sheikh, I since we do not regard his position l&amp;X ' : ns analogous to/^the Sheikh of Koweit.J On general grounds, however, would seem desirable if possible to treat him during his lifetime on the same basis as the Sheikh of Koweit without prejudice to a possible jl decision on our part on his death 4 * that he had no successors,***^ 10.

The tenure is ,, miri’ i with which the Ottoman Land Code was exclusively concerned. With regard to the question put in the third paragraph of your despatch No. 370 of June 26th, I am advised that, whilst it would appear possible for the Shaikh to enter a plea of prescription under- Article 20 oi the Land Code, it is probable that the Court would hold that, as prescription cannot run in favour of an unregistered occupier, the validity of the Shaikh’s registration (the main issue) must be tried before the issue Q,f pre.sei lotion. If the Court found that the registration was void ab initio it seems likely that it would also hold that prescription cannot run. On the other hand, in the absence of any recorded decisions, it is not possible to forecast with certainty the result of a plea of prescription, and my Legal Secretary is accordingly taking steps to ensure that its possibilities are not overlooked by the Shaikh’s lawyers.

(S 4945/308/93) U G V o 1955 j Dear Donaldson, You will remember that I spoke to you a few days ago about Laithwaite’s letter No. P. Z. 5060/33 of the 22nd August in regard to the date gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. I have ascertained from Woods at the Treasury that, in view of the strong political arguments cited by Laithwaite, he will be prepared, in spite of his natural reluctance to deal with hypothetical issues, to consider the basis on which compensation in respect of tax exemption could be paid in the event of compensation being ultimately agreed upon. But he has made it clear that any discussions on this point must be entirely without prejudice to the issue of principle. 3. In view of this, and as we share your desire for an early and satisfactory liquidation of the whole COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL question Donaldson, Esq. COPY SENT BY air mailquestion, we agree that the hasis of compensation should he explored with the Treasury. I gather from LaithwaiteVs letter that your ideas regarding the manner in which the question of compensation should he tackled are already fairly clearly defined, and, if such is the case, we would welcome an expression of your views on the subject. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to Woods and Stuart King. Yours sincerely0 STEHKDALE BEHNETT, ESQ., G.M.G., M.O (w) loS - f 8 C 5202/308/9?)

A copy is enclosed. It was not an order, but a notification that the Tapu office would re-open for the transaction of business. It was published in the daily 'Basrah Times' from the 3 rd to 7 th May, 1915, inclusive. Unfortunately for our purposes it was not issued by the General Officer Commanding but by Sir Henry Dobbs himself as revenue Commissioner. have not been able to discover any order or proclamation issued by the General Officer Commanding that gave Sir Henry Dobbs any powers at all, even as Revenue Commissioner, nor is there any definition of his responsibilities for the Tapu Department. There appear to be no copies available in T Ira 4 . of the General I outine Orders of the Army of Occupation of the period in which such an order might possibly have appeared but Sir Henry Dobbs himself says in his letter that he believes that no such order was ever published. /ithout it the notification in the Basrah Times cannot attain the status of an order by the General Officer Commanding and is practically valueless so far as the Faddaghiyah estates are concerned. You(inX o&lt; You ask me to give you any information obtainable regarding the extent to which the title to property in Basrah depends on the steps taken by the Revenue Commissioner under this notification. I am advised that there is little ripk that any Tapu deeds given by the Revenue Commissioner in regular manner, and in conformity with Turkish law, will be Impugned. You will see from the notification itself that Tapu deeds were to be prepared 'under the former laws and 'orders' and it is reasonable to assume this was adhered to and that sanads were lacued in a regular manner and are, for all purposes, valid. The danger of Invalidation of title would only exist here Tapu deeds were issued irregularly and not in strict conformity with the technical requirements of Turkish law. There are no mesns of ascertaining whether any irregular deeds were issued. We know that in the Faddaghiyah case this was so, hut it is (quite likely that this was the only instance. Briefly put, there is no attack upon the validity of the re opening of the Tapu Department or of the bona fide transactions registered therein. The flaw in the Faddaghiyah title deeds exists because the Revenue Commissioner in issuing them went outside the terms of his notification and, for reasons which at the time appeared co be good and compelling, granted them not in accordance with the 'laws and orders’. I am driven to the conclusion that we should not be able to argue with conviction that the non-validation of the Tapu deeds issued for the Faddaghiyah estate would have a serious detrimental effect upon regular Tapu transactions carried out in Basrah during the Occupation. It is the legality of these particular deeds, not the operation of trie Tapu Department, which is in jeopardy. Yours ever, (signed) George 0.

He was apparently quite success ful, and was able to get the original document for the sum of £50* r fhe production of this very valuable document puts an entirely new complexion on the Faddaghiyah Law Suit which is to be filed shortly. 5.

Stt* I arrived in Baghdad by Air on Friday the 28th July and stayed with H.M f e Charge dSAffaires. M.Saturday ,29th July # T)i® Fao agrarian troubles were discuaeed at a meeting consisting of Mr, Bihill the Legal Adviser to H*M f a Ambassador t Mr, Stafford, Financial Adviser, and myself* At this meeting 1 1 explained what te^knew about the trouble® and read out latter Ho. 172 dated the 27th July with enclosures, which I had two days previously submitted to the Ben*ble the Political Resident at Bushire. Mr#Stafford than showed me H.M.Government * s telegram to the Charge d f Affaires date ! the 20th July 1933 and the draft letter which it was proposed should b© sent to the Prim© Minister of Iraq. I agreed with Mr. Stafford*s suggestion that the word **sabotage* should be omitted from this letter as likely to complicate matters. It was also* agreed that if possible I should personally discus© the matter with the Prime Minister, before presenta tion of the letter, and to this end the Prime Minister was invited to dine with Mr. Ogilvle Forbes the following night (Sunday). The same evening I met Mr, Edmonds, Acting Adviser to the Ministry of Interior and talked over the Shaikh*s difficulties. S* on Sunday the SQth Jjily . I met the Prime Minister, H#S* Has chid All Gailani, as arranged, and after dinner was given an opportunity of having a private talk with him. Ill© Prime Minister was extremely cordial and affable and showed pleasure and surprise at the ease with which-(B)- I was able to apeak his langtaage, ‘mis poesibly led him to 'open his heart ?&gt; in the rather surprising way he did. He quite oandldly and openly discussed (i) • &gt;.1 ng Bin iiaud and his affairs (ii) ICing Faisal f s aspirations (ill) Shaikh of Kuwait's troubles, ht the same time it i® only fair to say that he several times remarked that what he told me were his personal views only, and that he did so because he saw that X was a lover of the Arab and so felt sympathetically Inclined towards me. As regards (i) the Prime Pin!star opined that Bin Baud was vary near being cm the rocks, and that unless he took a pull at himself the 'crash' would soon come. He was bankrupt and the recent Asir Campaign had just about given him his 'coup de graee*. His stupid and cruel treatment of the great Najd tribes had alienated the affections of every one ihrofcghout Arabia. All his people were quietly and patiently awaiting the end. He particularly blamed Bin Baud' s false and traitoroud (his words) Egyptian and Syrian advisers, who were only playing for themselves and not for Bin Baud. With the death of Bin Baud he saw complete chaos, and then Iraq, Transjordan, Kuwait, etc., would com® into their own. He blamed Hie Majesty's Government for allowing Bin Baud so much rope, especially In his dealings with the IT.S.S.H., and emphasised that the Amir Faisal's visit to Moscow was not the innocent one that Hie Majesty’s Government supposed* Bin Baud was deliberately trying to play off Moscow against London, and would go on doing so by means of other foreign powers also. He was severely critical of Ills Majesty's Government for allowing Bin1 -(3) It Bin Sand to go on blockading Knrmit as he was doing, and opined that His Majesty's Government had only to turn, her face f from Bln Baud or simply threaten to do this, for Bin Band to ” oome to hoel n at once. He was an Arab and understood a fellow Arab better than His Majesty* s Government, and if only His Majesty’s Government would firmly tell Bin Baud, once and for all, to stop bullying Kuwait, why the results would be surprising: (This remark amused mo not a little). Bin Baud knew better than any one that it was His Majesty’s Government alone who saved him during the Akhwan rebellion and the more recent Ibn Hifada trouble, H© Bin Baud knew that if we ware to withdraw our good wtll^ then all the tribes in Arabia would at once break out into revolt# Bin Baud only kept them quiet by preaching that His Majesty’s Government was under an obligation to him and would com© to his help against his own people if need be. As regards (ii)# The Prime Minister opined that Ling Faisal was England’s real friend, and not Bin Baud, for Faisal knew and realised £ i that he could not stand without His Majesty’s Government’s continuous help* This being so His Majesty’s Government should have more confidence in Faisal and allow him to widen his territories, in opposition to Bin Baud who was not a friend but really an enemy of England, as we should s me day see# Everyone knew that neither Kuwait nor Transjordan o&gt; uld dt&amp;nd alone economically or other wise, what better than to allow Iraq to absorb bothj by means of fair and suitable treaties* This would not moan the removal of Amir Abdullah or Shaikh Ahmad^) U1 ** {4}** mm&amp;i both woxaa retain their personal powers, and continue to run the internal administration of their states without Interference* All that the head state Iraq would be responsible for would be their Foreign volley* The Prime Mini star then asked if I did not agree with this view, but I fear received only a laughing and non**ooirjs.ittal answer* .£*L^l!£yL^ » The hrimo Minister expressed muah sympathy with the Shaikh over the question of the tstafelale tax, and said that he had heard confi dentially from London that the matter would shortly be rattled satisfactorily to both Iraq and Kuwait* (lXAjt\^csy Iraq would waive fill her past reveniia, and His Majesty’s Government would pay Kuwait’s share of all future land revenue to Iraq, Ho said nothing about the Feddaghiyah or Bashigeh oases, but asked what the Shaikh hat thought of King ^aisal, and his recep tion in Baghdad last year* He emphasised how such he personally had liked the Shaikh and was most impressed with his courtly and charming bearing* Its knew also that Faisal thought the same as himself. It was hare that I thought the opportunity an excellent one to open the question of the Shaikh’s Fao property and the communis tic trouble that was going on there* This I did in detail, giving it ae my opinion that the fellaheen had got out of hand either because of some interested and unknown persons intrigue, or because the long delay In the settlement of the Bashigeh and PaddagMyah cases which every cm© believe a would eventually be taken from the Shaikh had encouraged the fellaheen to think that they might be successful also in getting a slice from the Shaikh’s estates if they made enough noise. I then quoted the Bedouin proverb 'when the camel ia down out comes everybody’ll knives* which pleased he*• (ts)** th© Prim© Minister* rh© 'Tim© Minister expressed great surprise th&amp;fc e ! oh a situation had been allowed to arise f and espooially that he had not been told about it. I© promised to tahe immediate action in the matter cina. said na would tel©graph to the -utasarrif nsra, and order him to get fen to the trouble at once. 1 pointed out that the Shaikh was uofet avers© to doing anything that might h© construed by the local Government as ?t irritating the situa tion^, so had not sent us yet any nature to watch the date crops, as is customary each year* I suggested that as the Hutasarrif had definite machinery for settling disputes between landlord and fellah, it should be put into motion and the trouble would cease* IT® agreed and thanked me for telling me about the matter and asked me to give his compliments to the Shaikh and tell him not to be anxious about the final result* I here thanked the Prime Minister and our talk ended* Hote* I have given the Prim® Minister's talk somewhat at length as it may be found of interest although I quite realise that what he said did not eencern the business I was on* 4* On iloator 31st July * X had another meeting with Mr* Stafford and Mr* HIM 11. The Feddaghiyah case was discussed and especially the recovery of th® 'Power of Attorney' which Aisha gave to her husband, authorising him to sell the Faddaghiyah to Shaikh Mubarak* It was agreed that the obtain ing of this document put a complete new complexion on the matter* 1 was asked (a) to obtain a copy ofC\ -(e)- of the lower of Attorney for the Embassy and (b) to warn tlie whe,lkJi and Ur* Gabrlei (lawyer) that the Basra Courts would find a way of serving a summons shortly on him, either by registered letters or by publishing it in the Basra papers#, (c) To tell Ar* Cakriel to prepare to file his defence before the 15th September, as there was evidence to show that the ease would come off about then. (&amp;} I was further asked to obtain tvovx r. Gabriel all the names of the living heirs Of Aiysha. Mr. Kihill gave it as his opinion that Bis Majesty*s Government* s delaying action had been very helpful and that now there was no longer any reason why the Shaikh sh&amp;uld avoid defending the case when it came forward. I agreed and promised, to get all the information he wanted* 5, On Monday the blot July (Ifoon) . At the suggestion of Mr. Ogilvle Forbes, I went and saw Hr* Honk, acting I'lrector General of Customs, regarding the alleged excessive contraband that was passing .from Kuwait into Iraq. I found Mr* Monk not particularly helpful at first. His attitude, I fear, was that of the Englishman who has become mor© IRAQJ than the real article* Kuwait was the sinner and must be punished. Iraq was the poor suffer lag innocent party, struggling to do the right thing. Kuwait must be brought to her senses, either by the method of depriving her of her drinking water from the hhatt-al-Arab, or by a policy of super fright fullness on all and sundry caught armiggllng. That is to say by shoot ing out of hand any? person so caught. Mr* Gemk f s final contribution for the solution to the problem was.iJD r I ~( 7 )- wae for His Majesty**? OoyarjsauBt to foroe Kuwait to raise her Onstoms duties to the mmm level as tfet of Iraq* This he assured me could and would be done sooner thae I expected* B S i 1 fB -^ftor patiently hearing to all he Md to ^y» -t pointed out that (a) Kuwait was not hostile to Iran n.% he seemed to think, (b) that tho Shaikh was taking all precautions in his power to stop smuggling but had difficulties of finance, etc. (o) hat Iraq wore apparently under a serious delusion as to the amount of contraband that went from Kuwait. In reality the traffic was not great am! the ?-edeuin$ were the chief culprits, but that they^were most difficult to catch, seeing that they came in from all cuarters of the desert and bought only In small quaixti ties and ostensibly for th emae 1 ves. (d) I suggested that the Iraq Customs Department should really make some effort themselves to place Customs Posts on the 100 miles of Fuwait-Iraq land frontier. They had a single immobile poet ^ S dg^L-^tUX. Ksa^man, which merely watched the Basra - Kuwait motor road, but that BO miles of frontier was without a single poet nor was a patrol ever sent along the Batin from. Sa^wan to Rigai. In fact the door was entirely open, and the Bedouins had no difficulty in creasing into Iraq, wheraaver and wheTiiever they wanted. (a) I suggested that the Iraq Customs would do well to place 4 Custers posts on this Batin line, Instead of trying by a process of frightfiKinesB ^6 bluff to get Kuwait to do their work for them, (f} I pointed out that the Shaikh of Kuwait 1 8 point of view could be put in a nutshell. He was i : Mi sympathetic and would always do his best to coop erate. but Iraq r .-^wateh her own -frontiers. It was not Kuwait’s business to do this* (if) Lastly I pointed out that with Bln Saudi b Customs duties averaging 150S ad ralorem and Iraq’s averaging som® S0?&gt; it was obvious that 90), of the contraband trade would go into Saudi Arabia, for clearly the profits were so much greater* Kuwait 1 s whole policy was to break Bin Baud’s Blockade. # whether by sea or land* They had a definite quarrel with Bin Sand but non© with Iraq. (h/ Itv conclusion % suggested with some diffidence that the Iraq Customs should be c%efml not to swallow all the stories of the many Fao and bubalr spires who they employed. These men had to live, and good information meant good pay* (i) I think I was able to make Mr* Monk see a little of Kuwait’s point of view before I left# 6 * On. Wednesday the 2nd August * I had a full and frank discussion with Mr* Stafford with regard to ray discussions with Mr* bonk* I think I was able to clear up much that was not understood before. In particular 1 believe I was able to convince Mr* Stafford that the so called **Contraband” running from Km'ait to Iraq was nothing like as serious as the Iraq Government tried to make out* I offered the suggestion that perhaps it was part and parcel of the Shaft al Arab gardens business, and might not b© ms connected with the Iraq Government’s desire to got control of Kuwalt- ?* I returned to Kus ait by air on 3rd August.

With regard to the activities of Mr. Gabriel and Mirssa Fahomtf to which the Political Agent in Kuwait particularly referred in his confidential despatch Ho.114 of May 31st, I am forced to the conclusion that the Shaikh ’a legal representa tives are far from being above suspicion* It seems an extra ordinary assertion for Mr. Gabriel to make that he could have defeated Bafiah’s claim to a portion of the Baahiyah estate had he represented the Ghaikh in that action, bearing in mind that he was the advocate for the successful claimant. However, ?frr Gabriel would now appear to have a unique opportunity of demonstrating his versatility by appearing and winning for the Thaikh the other actions filed in respect of the remainder of the Baahiyah estate, where the lamies are identical. 3. As to the proposal that the Shaikh should compound in the case of the ^addaghlyah suit. It would, I suggest, be interest ing, should these gentlemen call again, if the blit leal Agent were to tax Mirsa Mahomed with the contents of his letter No. 1818/7/171 of June 14th, 1932, a copy of which was sent to the High Commissioner for *1 aq under cover of Colonel Biscoe’s despatch Ho.479-9 of July 11th, 1932.

I have the honour to be, Sir, ■ Youv obedient servant, B&amp;, (reorge Ogilvie-^orbes,5 ^ Opinion on pointa raised in paragraph 3 of the Honourahle Heeldent in the ^ereian CHtlf, Hushire, despatch Ho.614-B of June 7th, 1933. ^he Political Resident asks (a) whether the Bhaikh could obtain a stay of execution, (f) file a cross suit, and (c) whether the defendants in the cross suit could clal?$ raesne profits. , I nill deal iffith (c) first, I have consulted M&gt; , kroner on this point* He is of the opinion that the court would not consider an application for mesne profits owing to the fact that the claimants* right of action has been open to them for years past, and, accordingly, they must be held to have acquiesced in cultivation by the Shaikh during the period in whidi they might have brought their claim but did not do so. As regards (a), there!s no precise parallel in ’Iraq procedure to a stay of execution. In both the Bashlyah nnd ^ad&amp;aghiyah suits, however, the Shaikh would appear to have plenty of time to prosecute his counter claim. In the first place, it would appear almost impossible for the Bhaikh to lose possession of either estate until all the claimants have obtained judgment in their favour. Ms regards the Bashiyah case the position at the moment is that one claimant, Hafiah, has established her claim to approximately one twelfth of that portion of the Bashlvah estate concerning which the Shaikh’s title is in doubt. Other claimants have filed suits covering the remainder of the disputed area, but so far no service has been effected on the Bhaikh, Since obtaining judgment, so far as I know, ^afiah has taken no steps to obtain execution. It/It i» no* open to her to enter into an arrangement *ith the Shaikh for her share of the profits of cultivation. If this fails she can apply to the court for actual physical division of the land* ‘But here her difficulties will begin, 'i’he court will not cut off a slice of the estate approximating to her share and give it to her; on the contrary, the division has to he one twelfth of everv neve, ^ard, or square inch. With other suits pending concerning the property to he divided the Court would almost cert&amp;lnly postpone actual physical division of the land until those suits hod been determined. In the case of the %ddaghiyah estate only one claimant has so far entered an action, Abdullah, ibn Isa, and his claim is as to one third. The same cone id erat ions apply here, namely that in practice it would be extremelv difficult to oust the Sheikh from possession until adjudication had been completed on claims to the remainder of the property. (b) Mr. Grower is of opinion that the court would not hear a counter claim for a return of the purchase money until judg ment has been given against the Shaikh. The Shaikh could of course pro coed piecemeal, ^'hus he might claim a proportionate return of the purchase money from ^afiah, assuming that he can show her to be an heir of thr vendor, or he can wait until judgment has been given against him on the remaining Bashiyah suits and then proceed against all the successful claimants. Alternatively if he admits the claim both in the Bashiyah and ^addaghiyah estates, be would file his counter claim at once, Wo doubt his best course of action is to admit nothing and keep his counter claim in reserve. The process of execution in this country works so slowly in normal cases that the chances of the Shaikh losing possession anterior to the determination of his counter claim seem remote. The/The Gilhejrtian situation envisaged hy the Political Resident in paragraph ^ of hia despatch is quite a possibility. If the Shaikh obtains judgment for return of the purchase money he must first distrain on the movable property of the debtor or debtors and if he cannot thus obtain paysiert he may seize and sell through the lUxecution Office their land or undivided shares in land* It thus might happen that he would obtain seizure and sale of the share which he had just lost, if the market is poor, but it in for the debt, so that the parties would be as they were at first except that the Shaikh would then get a good title through the sale by the Execution Office.

With reference to your despatch No. 570 of June 26th last (E 6207/508/95), regarding the Shaikh of Kuwait’s date gardens in ’Iraq, I am advised that the application of Article 20 of the Ottoman Land Code to the action brought against the Shaikh in respect of his Paddaghiyah estate depends in the first place upon the nature of the tenure of the land involved. Enquiries made by my Legal Secretary through the Ministry of Justice have failed to establish with certainty to what category in Ottoman law the gardens in Question belong. I have, therefore, telegraphed to the Political Agent in Kuwait, asking him to bring with him, if possible, on his forthcoming visit to Bagdad, a copy of the Tapu title deed issued by Sir Henry jkfbbs. I am advised that on this deed the tenure of the various plots should ap ear. I will then address you further on the matter. 2.

With regard to the activities of Mr, Gabriel and Mirza Mahomed to which the Political Agent in Kuwait particularly referred in his confidential despatch Ho. 114 of May 31st, I am forced to the conclusion that the Shaikh's legal representatives are far from being above suspicion. It seems an extraordinary assertion for Mr. Gabriel to make that he could have defeated Hafiah's claim to a portion of the Bashiyah estate had he represented the shaikh in that action, bearing in mind that he was the advocate for the successful claimant. However, Mr. Gabriel would now appear to have a unique opportunity of demonstrating his versatility by appearing and winning for the Shaikh the other actions filed in respect of the remainder of the Bashiyah estate, where the issues are identical. 3. As to the proposal that the Shaikh should compound in the case of the Faddaghiyah suit, it would, I suggest, be interesting, should these gentlemen call ©gain, if the /Political le Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIREPolitical Agent were to tax Afirza J-laiioiHied with, the contents of his letter Ho. 1818/7/171 of June 14th, 195P, a copy of which was sent to the high Commissioner for 'Iraq under cover of Colonel Biecoe'e despatch No. 499 of July 11th, 1938. In this letter, which is one recommending the firm of Messrs. Jacob, Gabriel and Arteen to the Political Agent, Mirza Mahomed writes as follows; w My frien s are almost sure that they will win the case for the Shaikh”. This optimism contrasts oddly with Mr. Gabriel’s present view that the Shaikh’s case is H a hopelessly bad one in law”. 4. It is a melancholy reflection on the state of the Basrah Bar if the shaikh is unable to obtain disinterested legal advice from that city, I can suggest no remedy, however, other than retaining the services of a Bagdad advocate, which would be a most costly proceeding. I have, etc., (Signed) G. OGILVTE FORBES.Opinion on points raised in paragraph 3 of the Honourable Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, despatch Ho. 614 of June 7th, 1963. Ihe Political Resident asks (a) whether the Shaikh could obtain a stay of execution, (b) file a cross suit, and (e) whether the defendants in the cross suit could claim mesne profits. I will deal with (c) first. I have consulted Mr. Brower on this point. He is of the opinion that the court would not consider an application for mesne profits owing to the fact that the claimants 1 right of action has been open to them for years past, and, accordingly, they must be held to have acquiesced in cultivation by the Chaikh during the period in which they might have brought their claim but did not do so. As regards (a), there is no precise parallel in ’Iraq procedure to a stay of execution. In both the Bashiyah and Faddsghiyah suits, however, the Shaikh would appear to have plenty of time to prosecute his counter claim In the first place, it would appear almost impossible for the Shaikh to lose possession of either estate until all the claimants have obtained judgment in their favour. As regards the Bashiyah case the position at the moment is that one claimant, Rafiah, has established her claim to approximately one twelfth of that portion of the Bashiyah estate concerning which the Shaikh’s title is in doubt.. Other claimants have filed suits covering the remainder of the disputed area, but so far no service has been effected on the Shaikh* since obtaining judgment, sofBr 88 i know, kfifiah t&amp;kon no steps to obtain execution* It is now open to her to enter into an arrangement with the Shaikh for her share of the profits of cultivation. If this fails she can apply to the court for actual physical division of the land. But here hex difficulties will begin. The court will not cut off a elice of the estate approximating to her share and give it to her; on the contrary, the division has to be one twelfth of every acre, yard, or square inch. With other suits pending concerning the property to be divided the Court would alxaost certainly postpone actual physical division of the land until those suits had been determined. In the case of' the Faddaghiyah estate only one claimant has so far entered an action, Abdullah ibn Isa, and his claim is as to one third. The same considerations apply here, namely that in practice it would be extremely difficult to oust the Shaikh from possession until adjudication had been completed on claims to the remainder of the property, (b) Mr. Drawer is of opinion that the court would not hear a counter claim for a return of the purchase money until judgment has been given against the Shaikh. The Shaikh could of course proceed piecemeal. Thus he might claim a proportionate return of the purchase money from Rafiah, assuming that he can show her to be an heir of the vendor, or he can wait until judgment has been given against him on the remaining Baehiyeh suits and then proceed against all the successful claimants. Alternatively, if he admits the claim both in the Bashiyah and Faddaghiyah estates, he could file his counter claim at once. No doubt his best course of action is to admit nothing and keep his counter claim in reserve. The process of execution in this country /worksworks so slowly in normal cases that the chances of the Shaikh losing possession anterior to the determinetion of his counter claim seem remote, .i The Gilbertian situation envisaged by the Political Resident in paragraph S of his despatch is quite a possibility. If the Shaikh obtains judgment for return of the purchase \ money he must first distrain on the movable property of the \ debtor or debtors and if he cannot thus obtain payment he may seize and sell through the Execution Office their land or undivided shares in land. It thus might happen that he would obtain seizure and sale of the share which he had just lost and, if the market is poor, buy it in for the debt, so that the parties would be as they were at first except that the Shaikh would then get a good title through the sale by the Execution Office, (Id), J 10/7/53.^ 13 % : n ! Minute Paper. political Department. Please see the submission of 12th June, flagged B oelow, on tne subject of the Koweit Date Gardens. 1 Consequent on the discussion reported in that submission (tiie oldie ini record of which will be found on P.Z.3848/33 flagged) the telegrams on P.Z.3772/33 mere sent to the Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad. As will he seen, in telegram No. 110 of 24th June we asked the Charge d’Affaires to obtain as soon as pobsiole legal advice on lour points hearing on the ndsavours to dispossess the Sheikh from his Bashiye and Faddaghiyeh estates. 2* On 17th June the Charge d*Affaires reported to' the Foreign Office (despatch No.389 on P.Z.4131/33) that as the result of further investigation he was satisfied that the present day value of the gardens, even on a generous calculation, was well helow the original price, ana therefore if trie Sheikh was dispossessed and could recover than to-day’s market value; and finally - an important point - that in the view of his legal advisers a j claim for profits on the part of successful claimants , to the property would fail in view of the fact that no action had been taken by them during the 25 years of the Sheikh’s occupation. 3. The Embassy’s reply to the questions referred to it for legal opinion by the Foreign Office will be found on P.Z.4299/33 (Bagdad despatch No.433 of 6th July). The legal advisers are of opinioni- (a) that in 'the Bashiyeh case, despite trie fact that one claimant has obtained a decree in her favour/ 171 2b 5000 3/33m i ■Hta M favour, it is most unlikely in practice that the^ Sheikh would lose possession until the other claimants had succeeded; (b) that in any case in which judgment is given against him it is probable that execution coulu oe delayed, if a claim was made by the Sheikh tor a return of the purchase price, until judgment on the claim was given. The Legal Adviser draws attention to the fact that in the Bashiyeh case it is not certain whetner the present claimants are the only heirs, or that they may not claim that the vendor had no authority to sell thei mother's land, und thut they received no tiling, id estahlished z&amp;&amp;xts&amp;c£6X£) the dheikh s only remedy would ainst the other heirs of the vendor, if uny. This is a situation which we had feared might arise. (c) in the Legal Adviser's opinion it would he open to the Sheikh to appear in the Faddaghiyeh case and plead immunity. 'His appearance for that purpose would not constitute a submission to the jurisdiction, nor would the filing of a defence alternatively to the plea amount to submission'. The Legal Adviser expressed the opinion that acceptance of jurisdiction by the Sheikh in the Bashiyeh case might prejudice his plea of immunity in the Faddaghiyeh case, but that in any cake it is most unlikely that the Court would accept a plea of immunity from jurisdiction. WVMas~nowa point of immediate importance, which is discussed below. (d) The Legal Adviser gives no very definite opinion on the Question whetner, if a claim for the refund of the t originai purchase price, which was paid jin iurkish were ailowod, the amount to be refunded v,ould oe calculated on the rate of exchange existing at the time oi sale or at the rate of exchange of to-day and there are, he reports, no precedents in local urisprudence on which to pass an opinion. The Question is/Minute Paper. Department. is qiig YviiiCxi allows w id .6 scops for isgal arguirisrit/. He thinks, however, that the Court might well he Pdi^uahed. to hole! that the repayment should he on the same basis as the original payment, in which case the .Sheikh would, of course, he a substantial gainer. 4. Please now refer to the Resident’s telegram of 17th August, on P.Z.5Q60. The King has already undertaken, both to sir Francis Humphrys and to sir John Simon, to safeguard the interests of the Sheikh and secure him against dispossession. It will he remembered (paragraph 6 of record)) that Sir Francis Humphrys was of opinion that the best policy would he jt to delay the hearing of the case in which the Sheikh of] Koweit’s title to the Faddaghiyeh Estate was threatened, and to wait until next November to see whether King Feisal had by then implemented his promise. Sir Francis Humphrys agreed at the same - meeting that one of the essentials for a satisfactory ! solution of the Faddaghiyeh case was that the existing case should be withdrawn. I think on the whole that while we may, in the circumstances described in Colonel Loch’s telegram of 17th August, have authorise the Sheikh to appeag ■plead imunity from jurisdTctionTjat''the same time fili53g an alternative defence,- we should in the first instance, now that both Sir F. Humphrys and King Feisal are in Iraq, concentrate on endeavouring to secure that the bringing forward of the case shall be |postponed. The moment is not a very good one, given the extremely tense situation in connection with the Assyrian dispute, but we might at any rate try this bourse and fall back on the other 1712b 5000 3/33i • +U in'-h+ nf the Airfoassador* s react ion.

K;t 55 # 3?7 I deal 'below with the four questions put 'by the Foreign Office in their above telegram lettered (a), (b), ( c) and ( d) • (a) The assumption is not quite correct, since the procedure known ae a ®stay of execution^ has no exact parallel in ’Iraq. In practice, however, it is most unlikely that the Shaikh would lose possession until other claimants had succeeded. Eh© successful, claimant in f n i ^ ^ the Basiiiyeh case is now the owner of an individual share of the estate of approximately one twelfth of the whole. It is open to her to make an arrangement with the Shaikh to carry on cultivation in partnership. If this fails. she could apply to the court for actual physical division of the land. It is unlikely, however, that the court could proceed with this process whilst other suits —-* affecting the division were pending. Cb) If a cl ala la made by the Shaikh for a return ®f the purchase price it is probable that execution o uu.d be delayed until Judgment on the claim »e. given. In the Banhiyeh case the present claimants are heir© of ^ le ® but it is not certain (a) whether they are th© only heirs and (b) that they will not claim that the vendor had no authority to sell their mother* s land ana that they received nothing.

Sir, With reference to Sir Prancia Humphrys' letter to Mr. Kail (No. 111/33/33) of May 9th last, giving particulars of the area and value of the properties of th e Shaikh of Kuwait in 'Iraq which are under dispute, the further enquiries mentioned in the last sentence have now been completed and have established the following facts as to the area of the Paddaghiyah estate and the Bashiyah estate. (a) The whole Eaddaghiyah estate, including the Bashiyah portion, belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait has an area of approximately 946 jaribs (a jarib being 4,744 square yards, or slightly less than an acre). (b) Of this area, properties of approximately 516 jaribs in area are properly registered in the Tapu Department, Tapu Sanads are held for them and there is no dispute affecting the Shaikh’s title. (c) Of the balance of 430 jaribs, the Bashiyah estate occupies 43 jaribs, of which 33 jaribs are in dispute. (d) The purchase price of the disputed portion, calculated from the price paid for the whole Bashiyah estate in 1908, was £T3,445. (e) The portion of the Faddaghiyah estate proper which is under dispute has an area of 387 jaribs, for Bight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., e tc., etc., etc. ,5 ./ which a sum of £T44,427 was paid in 1908. 2. Taking the £T as having been worth 18 shillings in 1908 for the reason given in Sir Francis Humphrys’ letter, the amounts in sterling paid for those properties which form the subject of litigation, and of which the Shaikh of Kuwait may be deprived, are: Faddaghiyah estate .. £39,795 (£102.8 per jarib). ■ashiyah estate .. £ 3&gt;1 oo (£93.9 per jarib). ■3. The approximate present day value of these properties at the average figure of £57 per jarib is: Paddaghiyah estate ... £22,059. Bashiyah estate ... £ 1,881. Even if an additional 50% is allowed on these figures the present day value is well below the original purchase price. j he Administrative Inspector at Basrah has recorded his opinion that the estates could not be sold today for as large a sum as was paid for them in 1908. This supports the opinion expressed in Sir Francis Humphrys’ letter under reference to the effect that, if the Shaikh is dispossessed from these properties and is able to recover the amount orignally paid for them by his ancestor, he would obtain more than the properties are worth in the market today. 4. In this connection I would mention that the Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, in the course of a discussion, expressed the opinion that a claim against the Shaikh for damages for loss of mesne profits on account of wrongful possession would fail because the claimants have taken no action to recover their property during the twenty-five years throughout which the Shaikh has been in occupation. The Legal Secretary concurs in this opinion.5 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

BU-BJrci j Shslkii oi Kuvrait* s date gardens Sir 1 have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with telegram Bo.70, dated the 9th May 1953, from His Majesty* £ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,London, to your Shaikh should be deprived of his B&amp;shiyah and Faddaghiyah estates, under the Ottoman Law would it not be open to him, as it would certainly be under English Law, to apply for a stay of execution, and to file a cross suit for the return of the purchase money his grandfather paid for both the properties* it being not denied that the said sale and pur chase was In itself a bom fide transaction ? I understand that the value of the date gardens all over ’Iraq, including the properties in question, has depreciated considerably since 1908, when the Bhaikh*® grandfather made his purchase. Should, therefore, the defendants in the cross suit not be in possession of the requisite sum sued for by the Shaikh, ( and they are reported to be penniless), and should they not be able to raise the money on the Shaikh*s estates decreed to them because of the fall in the value of land, the Shaikh could then presumably distrain against the address. 2 . If the worst should come to the worst, and the defendanttf/ M&amp;jesty’s Amb&amp;ssador, British Embassy, Bagdad.defendants decreed estates, which would thus once more come into hie possession* This envisages a somewhat Uilbertian evolution, but is perhaps not outside the possibilities of the law as practised in * Iraq* The defendants, however, in the cross suit might be able to file a suit against the Shaikh for mesne profits, which presumably would more than effect a balance in their favour. The points x'aised are of some importance as they would seem to affect not only the Shaikh but also the compensation which His Majesty*® Government may have to pay to the Shaikh on account of his dispossession* 3, It would be interesting, theref ore, if your Legal Adviser could very kindly give an opinion as to whether under the Ottoman Law (a) the Shaikh could obtain a stay of execu tion, (b) file the cross suit indicated above and (c) whether the defendants in the cross suit could claim mesng profits. 4* If a cross suit was filed by the Shaikh the N defendants in the Bashiyah case would be the children of -M.dy Shaf iqa, from whom Shaikh Mubarak originally purchased the property, as given in paragraph 6 of the note enclosed in Colonel Dickson’s letter ho. 107 of 24th May 1^35 to Mr. Stafford. Of these individuals it is (f) - Rmfiah, who filed the suit against the Shaikh, which she won# fes 1 know the others have not yet moved in the matter* In the case of the Fad&amp;aghiyah estate the defendants would be of AyeatLR, wife of /hmed al Pasfta al ^utoair, tne ori^ntl vendor, (vide paragraph S of Politioel Agent, Kuwait s let e ho. 114, dated the 31st Jiay 1933, forwarded under this (1) Abdullah lbs I»a Al 3uhair (2) Sajeeba and ^3) Alda, nephew and daughters Residency/residency Printed letter &amp;o.612-S f dated the 7th June 1933). Of these only Abdullah has filed a suit against the Shaikh of Kuwait, ride paragraph 1 of despatch ho.43 f dated the 19th January 1933, from His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad, to His Majesty*« Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,London. The two daughters have hitherto taken no legal action but both are believed to fee interested and Najeeba has recently arrived at Basrah from Constantinople. b. with reference to Colonel Dickson’s remarks in paragraphs 10 and 11 of his letter Bo. 114 quoted afewe. The attempt at a compromise on the part of the plaintiffs in their Padd&amp;ghiyah suit against the Shaikh is interesting. The explanation is possibly connected with the hypothesis put forward in paragraph 2 above. If the plaintiffs, and more particularly their lawyers who are apparently acting for their clients on the basis of being paid their fees if the case is won, are doubtful as to what pecuniary benefit - if any - they will get, owing to the drop in land value, even should they win that case, naturally a compromise on a cash basis from the Shaikh would be most welcome to them. 0. Mr. Gabriel’s statement, (vide paragraph 14 of Colonel Dickson’s letter) that had the Shaikh been properly defended he would have won his Bashiyah case, is v ex\&gt; interesting ~ if correct# Colonel Dickson informs me that Mr. Gabriel has the reputation of being a clever lawyer, with a more than usually thorough knowledge of the complications of Ottoman Law. Mr. Gabriel naturally did not say what the point in Ottoman Law was which if raised in defence would/Vs 4- iv f I would laav© won that case tor the Shaikh, hut if it co Id fee discovered even now it might not be too late to affect the decision. A hint which Mr. Gabriel let fall to Colonel .Sickson indicated that the point has something to do with the tip© of land involved, and centered round the term 'sirf aiulk*• Perhaps pour Legal Adviser raai think it worth while to follow this up.

Stafford of the British Embassy, Baghdad by me, in this Office Confidential D*0*Ho*107, dated the 24th May 19^3, a copy of which was also sent to you* 4. You have already appreciated no doubt, that there are six young ladies claiming the third and largest portion of the * Baa hi yah*, one of whom, Kafiyah, has already got a judgement in her favour0L^\ ?r'&amp; 2 5. You \mve also doubtless gathered that the claim ants to the disputed ^addaghiyeh” Estate consist of 5 persons: (a) Abdulla al Zuhair, nephew of Awaaha : (b) Najeeba ) to) Aida ) who each claim 1/3 of the disputed area. 8* Hitherto/ we have heard a lot about the activities of (a) Abdulla al Auhair f but little mention has been made of the ladies (b) Najeeba and (c) Aida, her sister. 7*(a)Abdulla al Zufcair 9 who lives in Basrah, so far daughters of Avyasha ; has been the only of the three who has filed a suit. His A cow:ins (b) Najeeba and Co) Aida have been content to re main in Const cm t inop 1© and watch ©vents, knowing full well that if Abdulla won his case they would easily get judge ments in their favour also, as the claims of each are identi&lt; cal. 8* Recently (b), the Lady Najeeba, arrived in Basrah f impatient at the slow progress that (a) i bduila as uhair was making in the matter. 9* The lawyer employed by (a) Abdulla al Cuhair is one Mr.Sulaimen al Hhawaf, son, I believe, of the 1 resident of the Hhp^yeh Court in Baghdad; while 1 .B.li irza ! ohaiaed, C.I.E*, has been engaged on behalf of (b) Najeeba and (c) Aida. On the other side of the picture, an .,rmeni&amp;n Lawyer, of the firm of Tacub and Arteen, who, with Mirza Mohamed Khan may be considered the two best lawyer® that Basra can produce, is watching the case on behali of His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait • Note. The position of these lawyers and the** clients they respectively represent, is, I think, important. 10. Last week (28.5.33.) both Mr.Oabriel and Lirza HohamedKlrza Mohamad visited Kuwait, and called independently on tha aimikh and myself • 11, The gist of their separate conversations with m may be summed up as follows:- (a) lirza Tohamed . assured me, had only come to collect certain debts, due from Kuwaitis to his client, the late Shaikh of Hoh&amp;mmerah t but gradual -ly getting on to the FaddagMyeh land question, he gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh had no chance, whatsoever, of winning, should the case come into Court, as it was bound to do eventually, however much the haikh tried to wriggle out of it, by refusing to accept sum mons etc. etc. Mirza Mohamad added that quite the best thing he (the Shaikh) could do, in his opinion, was to try and compound the case. Ke ^ thought he could persuade (b)llajeeba and (©) L Aida to accept £5000/- each, although they would certainly ask £5000 and Hr.Gabriel would suggest this sum to the Lhaikh. He could not, however, say anything about (a) Abdulla al Zuhair* He mentioned, however, that the youngman owed Hajeebi He.20,000/-, for which an 1.0.U. had passed hands (date expired) and that he (Mirza Mohamad) believed he could bring pressure to bear on him by threatening to put him in Court for failure to pay this debt if he would not ♦toe the line*. (b) Mr.Gabriel , in his interview, was equally emphatic about the Shaikhs case being a hopeless ly bad one in Law, and that his on© and only hope lay in our being able to get from Istamboul, a copy of the original io^er of Attorney, granted by n Awash a * to her husband, authorizing the sal©— 4 -• of her property, (This has already been asked for) l!r.Gabriel then said that the Shaikhs best course, if we failed to get the above document, was to pay £T.S0OG/- to each of the three parties in the case, and so settle the matter for good and. all, otherwise he saw every chance of the shaikh losing the whole of that portion of the Faddaghiyeh property which was in dispute and with it the £T.44,£l?/~ f originally given for it* Lastly Mr.Gabriel said that he had hinted this form of settlement to the Shaikh, but the latter had not appeared enthusiastic, and had said something about consulting the lolitical Agent# Bote * Up to the tame of writing the Sheikh has not mentioned the matter to the writer. IS. It is interesting to note that Mirza ! ohamed and Mr*Gabriel aro great personal friends, and on this occasion travelled to and from Kuwait in the same car# They also lived together whilst in Kuwait* IS. It is also interesting to recollect that Mr# Gabriel was the lawyer working for the other aide in the ^Bashlveh** case when the Basra Courts gave a decree in favour of Hafiyah, daughter of Ghafiqa. On that occasion Mirza 1 ohamed, who represented B&amp;flyah and an other sister, appointed Mr#Gabriel to take charge of the case as h© being a Persian could not take part in the Courts proceedings M. Incidentally, whan discussing with Mr.Gabriel the old Bashiyeh suit, the writer got the interesting ad mission out of him that had the haikh been pi overly fended, he would never have lost that property, &amp;&amp;, i certain point of Ottoman Land Law had been raised by the defence, the whole prosecutions case would have f -' aieri' ■,%* \r, \ f) %10- ■,’. ••'' fi- '^tl ■’:' i : '''S £.'••&lt;*• ■ * t ,■ *■ ' V •:* Q ; e lb f ; a C:t M • % \ ■ th* ■ ■ i ^ ' _ ■ ; , ;■ '/ i -■ L 'd- 'A ■■ ■ .: : vvo' ' : n i '? *■ ; f ;m ' w x ; . ■ ;■ ; ' . ;■■ 'K x .. $&amp;!&amp; xo-&gt; lax.-xi «&gt;m H r t: .1 -•■x-' ; ,••. » .*A»i.W # %8 V »'»- •• ‘ 1 -I,;% , fc‘ ■ :x/■ x# ■ - x 'it ^ a.® w ms.** 01 C# ill iw* 'ssllt foU 0 X 1 ^ 0 © i;n r ^B ■■' .'l.’ = :-r.M ■£&gt; -■ $S? -j’O • ; •f&gt; rl: ;&gt;,3gf jX' ' ,.® .##t nai xxi.?i i p ^ j‘ ■c iXtrow ai! to ab(- 5 - to the ground.

There has recently been an effort to challenge the title of the Sheikh of Koweit to certain of the date gardens possession of which was guaranteed to him in 1914 ? on the ground that his title was never properly registered. As you will remember, the title was not registered before the War because the Turkish Government would agree to registration only on condition that the Sheikh aeclared himself a Turkish subject, which, on our advice and at our request, he was unwilling to do* Q , ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY No. 27 6 JUU 1935 Cappoquin, Go.Waterford. FROM SECRETARY, POLITIC-. SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFItE© - 2 - 111 1915 a tapu deed of registration in respect of the property now in dispute was granted to the Sheikh by you as Revenue Commissioner. The grant was admittedly not in accordance with the Ottoman Law and for this and other various technical reasons it ha s been argued that the deed of registration was void ab Initio . iou may, in this connection, care to see the copy which I enclose of your letter of 14th June 1915 to the Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit. l 116 Question is being further investigated here, we are, however, at this stage inclined to think that if, as we presume was the case, the Revenue Commissioner was authorised to register property in tapu by virtue of one ox the proclamations, articles or laws referred to in Part VIII of the Iraq Constitution, of which I enclose B, copy, and if, in registering the Sheikh’s estate he did not act in contravention of or exceed the authority conferred upon him, it should be possible to defend the legality of the registration. It seems to us possible that in carrying out the registration of tits property and others your action as Revenue Commissioner was taken under Ihe general authority of some Army proclamation or order which authorised you in that capacity to carry out transactions- 3 - transactions of this character* We have traced a reference in Army Orders (reproduced from the Gazette of India) to your appointment (on 26th January 1915) as Revenue Commissioner, hut we have been unable (the papers both here and in the historical section of the C.I.D* are very confused and there are many gaps in them) to find any corresponding order Indicating the nature of the duties which fell to be performed by the Revenue Commissioner, 4. If by any chance you remember after this long interval whether there was in fact any formal proclamation or order by the Army Commander specifying the Revenue Commissioner's duties, we should be most grateful if you could let us know. Sir Percy Cox, whom we consulted, tells me tha,t he was not actually in Basra at the time of the appointment of the Revenue Commissioner and that though he has a strong recollection that there was some order of the type in question, he has been unable so far mo trace it. sir Arnold Wilson has a very definite recollection that some notification appeared in Force Orders, but here again we have not so far succeeded in finding one. If your recollection is that there was any Army proclamation or order defining or referring to the nature/nature of your duties, we will renew our search, since if the duties defined included property registration without stipulating that, registration must he in accordance with the old Ottoman Law, then it might greatly strengthen our hands in considering that Part VIII of the Iraq constitution could he considered as validating your registration of the Sheikh’s property. 5. I need not say how grateful we shall he for any assistance you can give us on this rather difficult and controversial point, about which I trust you will forgive me for bothering you.

In refusing legislation the Iraqi Government were acting in accordance with the advice of Mr. Brower, British Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, who did not consider that he would be justified in recommending that legislation should be passed validating the title of the fSheikh *M1© e suit to deprive him of that title wae already pending.

T *olthwaite thoiight that by waiting until lovember we might be deferring action until a time when we should be in a weaker pee it ion and have fewer means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Tr8&lt;|l Government than we hed now*, He rebelled the negotiations at the time of the ratification of the treaty of 30th ♦Tune, 1980, when His Ma^eety^ Government agreed to postpone dlsouaslon of the u^eGtian of the taxation of the Sheikhs 1 date gardens until after the ratification of » the treaty. At that time we had trusted the promise of the Iraqi Government, who had not, however, settled the question afterwards* 8* Sir Francis Humphry^ said that the position had then ^mn different.

Wo re over, compensation of this kind was normally paid in the for* of one lump sum, and continued annual payments might well be a source of embarrosament in Perl lament. In any esse dimeultiea would arise aa to the period of time ft&gt;r which annual payments were to be made. Sir brands Humphrys had suggested in one of his telegrams that annual payments nhould be medo only for the lifetime of the present Sheikha. But would it he possible to bind the Sheikhs «nd their heirs and suoGgsaors finally to any stieh ar?angsnent? A perpetual annuity voted annually by Parliament seemed to bo out of the aueation* 23# Mr g l *endel suggested that an attempt should be made to reach an agreement ^ith the sheikha aa to an annual oniountf and that that annual amount should then be capitalised (either on a baaia of a perpetual annuity or of so many years purchase) and Parliamentary sanction obtained for the capital sum required* Thia would mean that Parliamentary sanction would be required for one payment only* The capital sum could. If necessary, then be put under the control of trustees, the resultant income only being payable to the Sheikhs annually on certain conditions. ^ 4t9 yo oda thought that this was a possible course, but that there would still remain a question as to the bests upon mhich the annual payment should be capitalised* 25. H T* Lc^t h walto said that, while the India of i c ® were not financially interested, he was inclined to think that prime27* facie the suggestion that compensation paid tc* the hieikhs should take the form of enmiaX payments was an sttrsetive one. %% would give us bo soditionsl hold over the Sheikh of Koweito Moreover, if on the death of the Sheikh of Mohammerah it was felt that the rel iione of His Majesty's Government with his successor wore such that the discontinuance of tax exemption could be justified in his ease, it might well be that adoption of this method of compensation would substantially reduce the financial burden involved In compensation* On the question of the period of ^xamption on which compensetio?i should be based;? he drm attention to the oategoriosl wording of the pledgee of 1914, in which no term was set t'* the period of the exemption* Whatever tun circumstances In the case of ?&lt;ohanmerah, it w ;uld be extreTtely difficult in the case of Koweit, without aeri nis loss of prestige, now to define our liability ns ceasing with the death of tie present Bheikh* soa M r* Etude! considered that it would be equally difficult to agree on the precise amount of the compensation to be paid to the Sheikhs, whether it should take the form of a perpetual or a temporary annuity or of a capital lump payment* fhat difficulty would exist in any case, but the ratio between the annuity and the capital required to provide it would be merely a question of mathematical calculation* He did not think that the main issue of principle was really affected by this point, mu in any ease he was of the opinion that it would be impracticable to decide either the amount Si the method of compensation until it W6S known whether the possession point hnd been satisfactorily 4 settled(x&amp; that at the interdepartmental meeting of 1st it had been decided to prepare a case for the Law Offlcera with a vlw to obtaining their opinion on the chances of success? if His Ma3®©ty 1 a Government took the Ira&lt;^i Govex*nment to arbitration on the whole question* It had so far teen Impossible to find time to prepare this osseg and indeed she likelihood of Hia Majesty’s Government deciding to go to arbitration was extremelj small* He thought§ however* that when the question same to he considered by the Cabinet* It would he necessary to 'he able to furnish them with a definite estimate of the chances of success if the question were referred to arbitration* as otherwise they would he unable to decide whether any settlement proposed was a satisfactory one® Mr* B eckett agreed* He also pointed out that* supposing King Faisal failed to implement his promise to Sir Francis Humphrya* and supposing It was then found impossible to persuade the Iraqi Government to pass legislation validating the Sheikh of Foweit ? a title* It would bo essential that w@ should know the chances of sneeze© If the matter were referred to arbitration. 2&amp;* The following were the conclusions of the meetings** Cl) That King Pel sal should be given until September or October to implement his promise to Sir Francis Humphry's* and that* If by then he had not done so t every effort should b© to induce the Iraqi Government to pass legislation to validate the Sheikh of Kowelt’s title to his Faddaghiyeh estate!

(b) In any case in which judgment is given against him, would Sheikh of Koweit be able to establish case for stay of execution until claim for refund of original purchase money had been heard, and, in the event of such claim being allowed until it had been ascertained that plaintiff was in a position to make necessary refund? This demand could presumably only be made if heirs of vendor, from whom refund would be claimed, were identical with plaintiffs in the case, or were predecessors in title of the latter, and I shall be glad, of information on this point, (c) La Faddaghiyeh case Sheikh is pleading immunity from jurisdiction of Iraqi courts&lt;, Could he, consistently with maintenance of tnis contention, put forward above demand ih Bashiyeh case and if necessary, as alternative contention in Faddaghiyeh case? .

This is where the Law Officers* Opinion cosies in,since he does hold the view that,after the Law Officers' Opinion ; we ought to pay a sum directly related to actual losses. It is hardly perhaps my business to amend what Humphrya is reported to have said and of course it he has seen and agreed the version in your draft I have no more to say; but I thought it as well to put on paper my recollection of hie view. Finally, the point emerged at the meeting that the judgment already given against the Sheikh' did not extend to the whole of his Bashifeh Gardens, out only to a small part of them.

The main points in issue were the validation of the Jieikh's title to the Faddaghiyeh garden and the question of the action to he taken in regard to our guarantee of tax exemption. ilS re S &amp;r h3 valiaation, it will he remembered that we had strongly urged on H.L. Ambassador the desirability of a validating law or ordinance ana hud pointed out that legislation of this character was not without precedent in uuio country, cti ma suggested as a possible basis of compromise that in return for valiaatilt^f the Sheikh' c title end for a waiver of any claim in respect of tax Vemption up to 1932 H.L.G. should themselves compensate ^e Sheikh for the discontinuance in future of such miption. sir Francis Humphrys had found the King favourably disposed towards a settlement mther on these 1 lin^s, out had reported that hour! was by no means optimistic and that the prospect of validating legislation seemed exceedingly poor. 3 * 3ir Francis Humphrys now explained that the Iraq f ParliaKient would not meet until next November; that even oimn iu dia he tnought the prospects of passing a validating ordinance were exceedingly poor (the government mignt, in fact, be ready to resign on trie point);#that tilere i ' ld ' s a strong objection of principle to itjluthat Proceedings had actually been opened in the Faddaghiyeh CaSe ’ ana tnat 1+u mula therefore definitely represent an interference with ttie normal course of justice. He intimated/- 2 - ■ V - Iv intlB&amp;ted that the King had given him a very solemn and peioonal assurance,in the presence not only of Nouri out ox one of the Ambassador's secretaries, that he would see that the Sheikh was not dispossessed. His own very strong recommendation was that we should rest content with this lor the moment; that as soon as the aing arrived in this country he (3ir Francis Humphrys) would approach him with a view to finding out what steps he had taken to implement this promise; that he should continue to bring pressure to bear on him in connection with it, ana that the Question of a validating law should only be brought up if, oy uhe time Parliament met again in November, the King had piov^u. unwilling or unable to dispose of the matter, ue agreed that the claim to possession could only be regaraeu as satisfactorily disposed of, firstly, if the exi^oi,.g caoc was withdrawn; secondly, if arrangements coula oe maae oy the King, etc.,once it had been withdrawn, for the co-ope ration o f the va rious heirs of the original vend ors i n givin g the 3heikh a good title to the~ ~ Faaaaghiyen garden by witnessing its regular registration ifr ~ti8,PU . considerable discussion tlie confeience with some reluctance agreed that this seemed tue only course, it was further agreed that sir John oimon might be advised to take an opportunity of Intimating to Kin&amp; reisul during his visit the importance attached to — os lv ii.M.G. I doubt if the conference felt so optimistic as the Ambassador a s to the prospects of success, ^ut no ham would be done by taking this line, since In any' ^se as the lra Q Parliament will not meet till next mber a Validating law, even if we were prepared to press/- 3 - * jo k SLi*JcM , ^*u i CUS * Mj(A. f*~*&amp;*- ^ ^ *- Ut*j o*t ti tyifC*]*^ ly *s P\ s^ uoK-^ ^ J $&lt;S ^LAtU. t QtAA ^j^- t lU ^ &lt;rUc^Ji —r ^ (lyrlretfi &amp;r*vi t' (t ftr °fh i i^L h+A' -jt^i l^&lt;\~cd ^ h^.d f^ Jv~jL. y/Z-Ot-u ).7hZr MJ Zt AvJC t/tL 1? 1 /3 /,rJ *- Uuh ( 2 3n.si&gt;j)J »W- presa lor it now, coula not be considered before then, arrangements have been made by the Foreign Office to obtain an immediate report from Baghto^M there f* any risk of the Faddaghiyeh case being pressed on in the meantime. At the moment the Sheikh has refused to accept service of the documents and our only risk lies in an attempt at substituted service* iMoHIYuiH GAod . 3ir Francis Hurnphrys said tile position here seemed quite hopeless. The Sheikh had, in fact, submitted to the araqi Courts; ft judgment had gone against him and he appeared to have no remedy. The judgment is, however, m respect of one small share of the property only and it seems probable that effect cannot be given to It unless ana until successful suits have been brought by an the heirs to the whole property. The suggestion was made that, tne importance of Bashiyeh being relatively small, It might conveniently be used as a test ca Se X to decide certain important points of law which were bound to arise in connection with Faaaaghiyeh, notably, firstly, whether wie Courts, before agreeing to grant execution, wouM require um-t tne prosecuting parties should prove their ability to refund to the Sheikh the original purchase price; secondly, tne difficult question whether they could claim to refund in Turkish pounds at their present value (about l/8th of pie-.vai). The question of liability for profits might also oe tested. Attention was drawn to tne undesirability of the Sheikh compromising his claim that he was not liable to the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts in the Faddaghiyeh case by entering an appearance as a petitioner in the nasniyen case. It was finally agreed that Baghdad should• - 4 - t)e asked to advise asjto the prohahle attitude oi tae Courts on the questions referred to at the beginning of this paragraph. i^ethoa of com pensation to t ne sneikh for vvithfir«wm of nls tax exemption . °' Francis Humphrys said that investigation in Baghdad rather went to suggest that the value of the tax exemption was less than had at one time been thought prohahle and that it seemed possible that something in I the neighbourhood of £2,000 a year might entirely cover ( the ^leikh'V losses. Now that It seemed clear that H.K.G. f were legally and not merely morally liable, would not the j best course be to mice an annual payment to the Sheikh either in the nature of a composition for the tax exemption, or alternatively to take over liability for payment of tne tax themselves. His experience of Orientals had shown him in the first place that a lump sum was frequently rapidly dissipated and left no sense of gratitude behind it; seconaly that it was most important that we should give the ^eikhfemetning which wa^Likely to satisfy him ana which he would not regard as derisory IQ? value of the exemption. 6r*pu^| g wmie the India Office were not financially interested, mm suggestion seemed on political grounds to have much to |jj comnena it,* it would give us an additional hold over the m oh=ikh of howeit. line ifeTsury were unabie to conmit themselves but will consider thfe suggestion. As regards ito iinancing, tne alternatives open are an annual Parliamentary grant (the Parliamentary objections to this are/ ^11. 5 are considerable) or an immediate lump sum grant bv Parliament oased on tiie capital value of tiie exemption, ducn a grant coulu either be paid over in a single instalment or converted into a trust to pay the Sheikh an annual amount approximately epuivalent to the composition value of his exemption. The Treasury at this point raisea the question whether the compensation siioula represent purchase of a perpetual exemption or merely be fixed ah a sum sufficient to pay the amount of compensation regarded as appropriate to the present Sheikh for the remainder of his life. I drew attention to the wording or our pledges of 1914 ana said that I thought the case for compensation on a more generous basis was a clear one. ^ T]le matter will be further discussed with ' Sir Francis Humphrys during the summer. Prima facie 1 still think that his proposal has much to commend it and I might perhaps be authorised to take this line if and Mien the Question is again under discussion? I have continued to maintain the attitude that no financial assistance can be looked for from India.3EXED INDIA OFFICE, p# 2.5580/33. Confidential. MiIIEHALL, 3.W. 1 12th June 1933. Denr sir Percy, iou will remaiiiher uliat there hue oeen a great aeal oi discussion about the assurances in respect of tnerr date gardens in Iraq which were given to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mo hammer ah, in return for their assistance at the beginning ot tne tar, in 1914. There has recently been an effort to challenge the title of the Sheikh of Koweit uo certain ofthe dare gardens possession of which was guaranteed to him in 1914, on the ground that his title was never properly registered. As you will remember, the title was not registered before the. War because the Turkish Government would agree to registration only on condition that the Sheikh declared himself a Turkish subject, which, o- our aavice uno. at our request, he was unwilling to do. In Sir Henry Dobbs, as Revenue Commissioner granted the Sheikh of Koweit a taou deed of registration in respecr o: the property now in dispute. The grant was admittedly not in accordance with the Ottoman law, and for nis and various other technical reasons it has been argued uhe deed of registration was void ab initio . We are mc±ined uo think, however, that if, as we presume was the cusu, the Revenue Commissioner was authorised to register property in tapn by virtue of one of the proclamations, articles or laws referred to in Part VIII of the Iraq Constitution, of which I enclose a cop}/, and if in registering the Shaikh's estate he did not act in contravention of or exceed the authority conferred upon him, l £h r T pcrcy Cox 4.

Lobbs was acting under the general authority of some Army proclamation or order which authorised him, in his capacity of Revenue Commissioner, to carry out transactions oi this character. We have succeeded in tracing a reference in Arm Orders to his appointment (on 26th January 1915) as Revenue Commissioner, but we have been unable (the papers are very confused and there are many gaps in them) to find any corresponding order indicating the nature of the duties which he was to perform in that capacity. I wonder if, by any chance, you remember cj. uer oh is long: interval whether there was in fact any formal proclamation or order by the Army Commander specifying the Revenue Commissioner^ duties? If your recollection is that there was we will search again, since if the duties defined included property registration without stipulating that registration must be in accordance with the old Ottoman Law, then it might greatly strengthen our hands in contending that Part VIII of the Iraq Constitution coula be considered as validating his registration of the ^re xkh ! s pro perty, 3 r . x i must apologise for bothering you with a point 3 * ^ n80 d not say how grateful we shall be for any as stance you may be able to give us.

As you will see, the Sheikh’s agent encloses what purports to he a translation of a letter addressed to the Sheikh by Colonel Knox, in his capacity of Political Resident and Consul General. We had not previously seen the text of this letter, of the existence of which we were unaware. The translation enclosed with Humphrys’ despatch is clearly faulty, both as regards grammar and punctuation. Do you possess in your archives a correct translation? If so, perhaps you would let me have a copy for purposes of record. 3. I am sending copies of this letter to Woods, Stuart King and Blaxter.

My Lords are not clear as to the exact meaning of the suggestion made by Sir Francis Humphrys that H whatever action is decided upon the matter of compensation for the los ' of revenue exemption in the Qase of the Sheikh of I oweit should be applied also to that of the Sheikh of Moharamerah.' in Their Lordships’ view it is not necessary that the terms offered should be precisely similar in each instance nor do They think it desirable to give any undertaking too that effect.

I am dealing separately with an enquiry received from hr. Hall as to the history of the letter of September/October 1914 to the Sheikh of hohammerah, the text of which is practically identical with that of a draft approved by the Government of India which appears to have been issued as a preliminary to the formal assurances contained in the letter of 21st November 1914 from Sir Percy Cox to the Gheikh. u * /«A ttxAJ OiXDraft Paper. pclii’i cxi, Department.

H.A. Sir Mubarak-e a -Sabah, Ruler of Await and H.2. the Smir, Abdul bin Saud, Emir of Najed, to attack the town of Basrah and to relieve it from the Ottoman Government; and if you all be unable to do so - which is improbable - to endeavour, in cooperation with certain reliable Shaikh, to organise an arrangement to check Turkish reinforce ments from arriving at Basrah, and even at Qurnah, if this be possible for you, pending the arrival of the British forces which we shall send, God willing, as soon as possible to take possession of the aforesaid city. We hope, also, that two of our men-o-war will reach Basrah before your forces reach that place.

In return for your valuable assistance in this important matter, i am ordered by the exalted Oowrament to promise to lour excellency that if we succeed in relieving Basrah - and we shall do so, uod Willing - we shall not return Basrah for the second time to the Ottoman Government and that we shall not hand it bach to her at all.

The following are the particulars you require (a) The Shaikh of Mohammerah has Tapu titles to all his property in ’Iraq and no dispute seems likely to arise in respect of his ownership of them. (t&gt;) I enclose a copy of a note supplied at our request hy Dickson, which gives information regarding the Shaikh of Kuwait’s title to his estates in ’Iraq, which are covered hy the 1914 undertaking. You will see from this that, with the exception of the Bashiyah and the Faddaghiyah gardens, his title is regarded as incontestable. Your enquiry narrows itself down to the approximate capital value of these two estates* The Administrative Inspector, Basrah, estimates the present capital value of the Faddaghiyah estate as between £40 and £75 a jarih. There are 420 jaribs in dispute, and at the mean average price of £57 a jarib, the estate may be said to be worth £24,000 without revenue exemption, and £26,400 with exemption. As regards the Bashiyah, the estimated value of the estate at this rate would be £1,767 without exemption.exemption, and £1,945 with exemption. men assessing the maximum capital liability which would fall on His Majesty's Government, if the Shaikh is dispossessed finally from both these properties, account must be taken of the amounts originally paid by his ancestor as the purchase price of the properties in 1908. i n the case of the Paddaghiyah estate the purchase price was £T.60,000. In the case of the Bashiyah estate the purchase price was £T.4,489. it is from this that a curious point emerges. I find from the Report on the Trade of Basrah for the year 1908, compiled by Mr. Consul Crowe and published in ‘the Diplomatic and Consular Reports No* 4269, Annual Series, that the £T. was worth 18/2d. during 1908* Taking the £T. as 18 shillings, the purchase price for the two estates was £58,040 as compared with an approximate present-day valuation of £28,343. If the Shaikh is dispossessed from his estates, he would presumably have the right to recover the purchase money, and, if the above figures are correct, he would be entitled to recover more than the properties are now worth. I am making some further enquiries but the figures of present-day valuation are not likely to be disturbed on account of them* I have just seen Powle and have passed on this information to him - I fear that no further progress is likely to be made in this case for some months. Yours ever, (Signed) P*H. Humphrys&amp; 7 A 3H Hifldential* ,0. No. 156. /(?S/ &amp; ~ J J Political Agency, Kuwait, Pated the 10th September, 1932. My dear Stafford, Will you please refer to your D.O. No. 7063 dated the 25th August. I am afraid that if I replied to your question by a direct answer you would get a wrong impression of the true state of affairs, so at the risk of wearying you with a rather long letter I am going to give a somewhat fuller reply than what you perhaps have anticipated. 2. Let me commence first by saying that the Shaikh of Kuwait is by no means interested in all the lands held in Iraq or on the Shatt al Arab by persons bearing the n Al Sabah” name. When the great Shaikh Mubarak slew his brothers Mohomed and Jarrah and seized the throne, the children of the murdered men fled to Iraq and settled down on the Shatt al Arab and in 2ubair. There are many of them today, and although they are all connected with the Al Subah family in name, for all practical purposes they may be classed as Iraqis. 3# The descendants of the above Mohomed and Jarrah own several properties on the Shatt al Arab notably the following (a) Al Girdalan (to) Ajairawiyeh (c) Kut al Zain (a) Al Khor. I believe they are all held under Tapu, but I cannot definitely state this to be a fact. Note.- There is no property called Kut Khalifa as you suggest. Probably it has been confused with (d) Al Khor.^ Stafford, Esq., )e cretary to H.E. the High Commissioner for Iraq, Bagdad.5./ The above properties are today held in various shares hy Shaikhs Saud, Subah, Khalid and Atherby, the sons of Mohomed al Subah, and also by Shaikh Hamud al Jarrah the son of Jarrah al Subah. I shall not go into details as to the manner in which this exiled branch of the house came to acquire the above properties, suffice to say that when Mubarak acquired the Shaikhship of Kuwait and his brothers 1 families fled to Iraq, he was loath to leave their children with nothing, so settled the above properties on them, on condition that they gave up all claim to any share in the Pao and Parhawiyeh estates which Mubarak retained for himself and his own descendents. 4. The only properties which the Ruler of Kuwait (including the descendents of Shaikh Mubarak) is concerned in, are the following:- (a) Al Parhaniyeh (b) Al Mutawaah (c) Al Paddaghiyeh (d) Al Fao. These are the properties that are exempt from paying revenue to the Iraq G-overnment, under written promise given to the Shaikh of Kuwait by His Majesty's Government, and these are the only properties that we need concern ourselves with, whether we are discussing ’’Taxation' matters or 'Law Suits”• All other properties in Iraq apart from certain house property in Basrah and Ashar, are held by members of the exiled families of the murdered Jarrah and Mohomed and do not concern the reigning family of Kuwait. It is important to remember this, else we are likely to get confused.5 . l-.o’/v as regards these properties of the Ruler of Kuwait and members of his family. These are as mentioned in paragraph 4 above, and X propose below answering your questions as far as they are concerned only, as well as giving a short history of how each came into the possession of Kuwait. (a) A1 Farhaniyeh, This is a very small garden of about 30 jerits. It is not held under Tapu document, hut under deed of hequeathment, Its history is interesting. Some 70 years ago during the reign of Shaikh Suhah the father of Mubarak, a member of the A1 Zuhair family was in danger of his life and fled to Kuwait* His enemies and the Turks demanded that he should he surrendered. The Shaikh refused to do so and declared he would die in protecting his guest if necessary. When the storm blew over, the person saved bequeathed to the Shaikhs of Kuwait for ever the garden called ,f Farhaniyeh TT . (b) A1 Mutawaah. This is a large and important property acquired by purchase. It is held under Tapu document and in Shaikh Mubarak’s name I am told. (c) A1 Faddaghiyeh. This is a very large and important garden of 420 jeribs approximately excluding the .^aqf c*nd Bashiyeh portions and about 2 miles in lengtn and is below Abadan, between the Muquatas Kumn as A1 howasii ar Dora. It is held under Tapu document issued under the orders of Sir Henry Dobbs (then Revenue Commissioner, — - '• iI * j ’ the exception of the 'Bashiyeh' portion and a strip of WaaJ property which cuts right across the property as well as 3 very small gardens not shown in sketeu, vr ic , lie northern corner of the Faddaghiyeh and which belong to hand al Faddagh, Abdullah al Rashid and uohomea om !l - ishr P /See sketch below 1/ The history of the Bashiyeh you already know and the reasons why Tapu deeds were not issued hy Sir Henry Dobbs Note, - There is no A1 Kharm garden as such. It is the name of the water channel Y/hich surrounds the Faddaghiyeh property. The name, it is true, was mentioned by me in previous correspondence because some people call that portion of land lying between the rT Faqf Strip n and the channel, after the name of the channel.

Yours sincerely, ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER No, 22 FROM 8E&lt; 1 JUNJ 93 S FROM SECRETARY, POLITIC L AMD SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE SE.N1 TO Zombie, Esq.A meeting was held at the Foreign Gif ice at 11.3u a.m on Monday May 1 to discuss the action to he taken on Sir F. Humphrys’ telegrams hos. 69 and 70 ox April sknd and 27th concerning the date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Moh^merah. The following were present: Mr. herdel (in the chair)) Mr. Beckett ) ^ ) Foreign Ofxice. Mr. Hall ] Mr. Gore11 Barnes ) Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle Political Resident _ in the Persian Gulf. Mr. L-aithwaite Mr. Cromhie Mr. Woods Treasury. Treasury Solicitor's Department. Mr. Blaster Colonial Office.2 . were ox ijlie opinion 'that* most/ of 'the ^oocls smuggled into Iraq came through Koweit (although Colonel Fowle himself was inclined to the view that a considerable proportion came through Saudi-Arabia). sir Francis Humphrys had expressed the opinion that the Iraqi Government would probably be willing to grant the Sheikh an anti-smuggling subsidy, but that they would insist on treating it as a separate question. Furthermore the matter would need careful handling, since it would be necessary on the one hand to satisfy the Iraqi parliament that they would receive a definite return for the money voted, and on the other hand to avoid use of the word '’subsidy' or any other term which might imply that the Sheikh was in any sense subordinate to the Iraqi Government. 3, It was agreed that it was desirable that the Sheikh should be granted as large a sum as possible under this head, but that at the most the amount would not represent more than a small proportion of the total compensation which would have to be paid to the Sheikh. An anti-smuggling grant might ho waver help to make a settlement of the whole question some what easier. Mr. Fend el said that it seemed desirable in the first instance to discuss the main question of policy. Sir F. Humphrys ’ two telegrams shewed that he was strongly opposed to arbitration. His main financial argument against arbitration was that, if they won their case, the Iraqi Government would in all probabilityprobability claim arrears of taxation since 1921, This argument seemed a strong one c 5. Mr,. Beckett pointed out that such a claim would have to be brought either against His Majesty’s Government or against the Sheikhs, if against His Majesty’s Government then the Iraqi Government would need to establish that, in virtue of Article 4 of the Anglo-lraqi treaty of 1922 they had been obliged to follow the advice of His Majesty ? s Government in this matter 5 and that the advice given to them had been bad advice, entitling them to damages 0 Mr. Beckett did not consider it likely that the Iraqi Government would succeed in persuading an international court that they were entitled to damages on account of advice given to them by His Majestyhs Government while acting as manda tory, Against the Sheikhs, however, the Iraqi Govern ment possibly had a better case: presumably they could merely claim back payments of taxation^ saying that they had not collected them at the time pending a final settlement of the whole question, Mr. Rend el pointed out that His Majesty’s Government would eventually have to pay, whether the case was against themselves or against the Sheikhs, 7, Mr J Beckett agreed. He did not know whether there was a law in Iraq similar to the Statute of Limi tations in this country which would limit the date as from which the Iraqi Government could claim arrears of tax from the Sheikh. Use could be made of such a statute if the limit were,say, five years. The claim might4 0 might perhaps also he opposed in the case of the Sheikh o.l Koweit on the ground of the immunity from taxation of a foreign sovereign. m 1930 the Law Officers had advised that use should he made of this argument e hh T 7endel said that the vital point was that of possession* It was perfectly clear that the pledge given to the Sheikh of Koweit in 1914 covered thitj point* he div not uhink that the method of com*- pensating the Sheikh for dispossession suggested in paragraph 3 of Sir F, Humphrys’ telegr-am No 0 70 could be regarded as a full or satisfactory discharge of the obligation of His Majesty’s Government* It was in any case very uncertain whether an action brought against the heirs of the vendors for the recovery of the original purchase price would be successful, and even if it were successful, whether they would be in a financial position to pay* Mr, Laithwait e agreed with this view* He pointed out that the Iraqi claimants might not stop at dispossessing the Sheikh, but might then proceed to btfing a claim for damages, based upon the profits derived from the estates during the Sheikh’s and his predecessor’s occupation* 10* M r,, Beckett thought that even if a claim of this nature were established in the Iraqi courts, the judgment could not be enforced in view of the Sheikh’s status as a foreign sovereign* It was, of course, conceivableconceivable, as suggested by Mr, Eendel and Colonel Powle, that an attempt might be made to enforce the judgment by distraint upon the other properties of the Sheikh in Iraq, or to recover the Damages through the imposition by the Iraqi Government of extra discrimatory duties on the Sheikhs dates, but the claimants were private persons s and it was unlikely that the Iraqi Government would be willing to take or permit measures of doubtful legality against the Sheikh for the benefit, not of public funds, but of some private persons in whom they had no interest. Mr, Hendel and Colone l dcwle thought that the Iraqi authorities would find many means of bringing pressure to bear on the Sheikh if they really wanted to recover arrears from him 0 11 9 At this point a brief discussion took place between Mr. Goods and Colonel rowt e. concerning the basis upon which compensation should eventually be paid to the SheikhSo Mr. Woods , held tnat the amount of compensation to be paid to the Sheikhs should nou be assessed on the basis of discharging an admitued legal liability. In the Treasury view the right course would be to negotiate with the Sheikhs with a view to making the most advantageous bargain possible. Colonel Fowle ., on the other hand, wao o± the opinion that the amount of compenbauioa be based upon calculation of the amount Oj- M- 1 - ^neikh losses. ]_ 2 o Mr.. Kendel said that the basis of c«,m pensation must depend largely upon final judgments*««6 . judgments in the Iraqi Courts* For example s if these included an element of damages, it would be for consideration whether they should be contested on the grounds suggested by Mr c Beckett, or whether the amount of compensation must be correspondingly increased*. 13* Mr„ Stuafft^ fcjLpg said that in his opinion Sir FJIumphrys overestimated the objections to the validation of the Sheikh of Koweit’s title to his date gardens by an administrative or legislative act* Intervention by the Iraqi Government would be fully justified on the grounds of equity, since, owing to a purely technical flav/ in the Sheikh*s title, normal process of law would lead to grave injustice* Legis lation to remedy th4 position need not necessarily refe^ expressly to the Sheikh of Koweit, but might take ohe form of a general measure of validation similar uO tne United Kingdom Act of Indemnity after the war* Such an act would bo in accordance with the normal piac^-ce of nations* 14 agreed* Ke thought that the best course would be to try and make a bargain with the Iraqi Government by offering to take over the liability to compensate the Sheikhs -tor their future^ losses under the Isthilak tax provided that the Iraqi Government (a) validated the title of tne -’be' his Faddaghiyeh estate (b) agreed not to lai^ the question of arrears of taxation and (c) undertoo to impose no discriminatory tax upon the Sheikhs in future. 15 ,15 « pointed out that the legal proceedings in the case of the Bushiyeh Gardens were hy no means complete and that the Iraqi Government should theief 01 e, he considered, he asked to validate the Sheikn’s tiule to them as well 0 Admittedly it would he more difficult lor the Iraqi Government to intervene in this case tnan in that of the Faddaghiyeh Gardens, since the infirmity of title in the case of the Bushiyeh Gardens could not he ascribed to the war and military occupation* But if these gardens were included when the offer of settlement was made, there would at least he something to abandon as a concession later. IS* . Mr.c. Laitliwait e and C olonel Fowle were of the opinion that His Majesty’s Government should indicate to Sir Francis Humphrys the desirability of taking a stronger line with the Iraqi Government, if only for tactical reasons and as a first stage. While there was general acceptance of the objections to arbitration if this could be avoided it also seemed arguable that our case was a good one. The record of the Iraqi Government in dealing with this matter had not been very satisfactory and it seemed desirable, even if we did subsequently slightly modify our tactics, to adopt a more definite line with them at this stage and make use of the threat that the matter might have to be taken to arbitration, with results which could hardly be fortunate, unless some disposition to reach un equitable compromise was manifested by therm, M r, Kendel^ ,‘ ^ ni*}\ 'KLo So g^Rendel thought that the threat of arbitration would have to he very carefully used as it might prove to be more dangerous to His Majesty’s Government than to the Iraqis. 17o Ire Stuart-King thought that it would be easier to persuade the Iraqi G-overnment to pass legislation to validate the Sheikh's title by explaining thau it was In itself a reasonable step* than by using threats:; and it wa.s the general opinion of the meeting that no definite threat of arbitration could be made, until further legal advice had been obtained as to the chances of success, should the whole question be referred to arbitration® IS® Mr* Woods explained that Ministers had not yet been consulted at the Treasury® He felt sure, however, that they would consent to Sir F® Humphrys being instructed to approach the Iraqi G-overnment with an offer of settlement if this would ensure the validation of the Sheikh’s title, provided he did so a titre personnel and without prejudice. Mr. Rend el explained that the Foreign Office was chiefly concerned with the question of how our pledges could be honoured to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. But as this Sheikh's title was not in question, he agreed that the case could be dealt with separately. 19. The following wore the conclusions of the meeting agreed to by all present. (1) That a telegram should be sent to Sir F. Humphrys informing him that the first essential was to protect the Sheikh of Koweit from dispossession, and that if the Sheikh s title could be made secure His Majesty’s Government would probably agree to v/aive their claim to tax exemption lor the Sheikh , would// 10 ./ Government, and asking whether there was any law in Iraq similar to the Statute of Limitations in England. (3) That meanwhile a case should he prepared for the Law Officers with a view to obtaining their opinion as to chances of success, if the whole question were referred to arbitration. FOREIGN OFFICE.

Briefly, the property was purchased by Shaikh Mubarak as-Sabah, grand-father of the present Ruler, from Ahmad Pasha bin ^asim ax-^ubair in virtue of a power of attorney which the latter got from his wife T Aish&amp;h bint ‘Abdulla Chairbi ai- ..ubair. The power of attorney was issued by the then .*adhi of the Court of Galata, Constantinople, Mustafa Kadhim Sf endi on the 15th Eamadiian 1326* 3.

If our gov ernments could not agree among themselves recourse to arbitration seemed inevitable but before advising my government to take this extreme step I proposed to ex plore final possibility of friendly settlement. I as- I sumed first that if obligations could be satisfactorily disposed of Iraqi Government would be willing to legalize past exemptions. My government were unable to fulfil their promise regarding continuance of possession with out assistance of Iraqi Government. I put forward short draft law which would have the effect of valididating Dodd’s grant of Tapu registration for Faddaghiyah gardens.

As regards the prospects for a revision of the Appeal Court’3 judgment in the Bashiyah case, I am advised that it is most unlikely that the Court would entertain an application for revision, since, under the Civil Procedure Code, revision of an Appellate judgment is not permissible unless the aggrieved suitor can produce some evidence that the judgment against him was obtained by fraud or by the suppression of some material document. The Court will not admit an application for revision based on points of law which have already been before it.

(1) That there was a bona fide sale transaction and that the ..urchnr-e price was paid* It is admitted that, in regard to both estates, the purchase price was paid to a person who purported to be the bona fide vendor but it is not admitted that the vendor had authority in either case to sell. In any case a sale without a legal transfer of the Tapu title does not convey ownership# (2) That one of the reasons why the . halkh did no t a ceuii e a title of his Bashiyeh estate was because of his reluctance to Become a Turkish subject, a rc^luctance which His laje^ty^s Govermient di d t heir beat to foster* This assertion might avail the Shaikh in a moral eluim against His Majesty’s Government or the *IrayJL Government but it would oe useless to him in an 1 Iraqi Court* The Court would not enquire into the reasons why he failed to obtain a Tapu title. (3) Whether the in dan Limitation Act can be pleaded.. The claim to prescription under the Indian Law is defeated by Article 1674 of the ivejella. That Article says that H the right is not lost by prescription” which is but another way of enunciating as a general proposition the English principle that a statute-barred debt can be revived by acknowledgment.

Nor do I think that much reliance can be placed on the fact that the Htoman Government accepted the miri tax on the estate from the haikh. The Court, would, I think hold that that was an administrative act w ich was no concern of th irs.In the light ol the Treasury comments containea in lx. yoocis* letter of the 4th lay below and of certain suggestions, of which we have not received a copy, made by Mr. Stuart King, I have concurred in the amendments in the draft telegram about the date gardens shown in manuscript on the file copy below. Neither from our point of view nor from that of the Foreign Office are certain of the Treasury amendments entirely satisfactory. But in the interests of avoiding delay and as no very substantial point was involved at this stage it seemed more important to ^ secure the early issue of the draft than to hold it up pending discussion which might have proved unfruitful. 2. Sir F. Stewart indicated the other night that he felt some doubt as to the soundness of the argument in the draft personal telegram to Sir Francis Humphrys that if an action a gainst the heirs of the vendors for the recovery of the original purchase price of trie gardens was successful there was no certainty that the heirs would be in a financial position to pay; his pointbeing that if the heirs secured possession of the gardens they would have a security so valuable that there snould be no difficulty in raising the necessary amount of £60,000. I discussed this with Mr. Hall, who pointed out that the financial position of the' heirs of the vendors was still, according to a note received from Sir Francis Humphry 8 dated 28th February, uncertain. It is quite likely that they may have parted with their true interest to the lawyers who appear to be instigating the present proceedings, and oiiut the Sheikh's only remedy would lie in a costly and intricate action against third parties. Mr.Wakely, in the light of this explanation, agreed that the draft might issue as it stood.COPY. treasury chambers. 4th May, 1933. My dear Hall, Many thanks for your letter of yesterday and the two draft telegrams to Bagdad. I am authorised to say that the Treasury concur in the general line of the first telegram. We should be glad, however, if you would consider the following minor alterations. Page 1. lines 6-10. We suggest the following version:- 'Apart from serious damage to British prestige . dispossession might involve payment Government of a very substantial sum'; ^ The point of these changes is (a) that we do not wish to imply to Humphrys that we propose to deal with the quantum of compensation on the basis of legal liability and (b) that the use of the word 'immense' may lead him to think that we have astronomical figures in mind. Page 2. paragraph 3. line 5. You have no doubt noticed the misprint 'if' for 'is'. Finally • H - Hall, Ssq., D.S.O., O.B.S., M.C., Colonial Office.Finally, we suggest that in regard to the instructions in paragraph 5, Hirnphrys should be given explicitly a discretion particularly in regard to the threat of arbitration. For this reason we suggest that the paragraph should begin as follows 'Unless you see overwhelming objection you 'should proceed on the following lines. You 'should explore ' The first paragraph of the second telegram causes us rather more difficulty. Humphrys 1 suggestion is seriously made and moreover it seems at first sight to be possibly the cheapest way out. We should deprecate, therefore, so strong a lead against it as is contained in this paragraph. Would the following be satis!actory from your point of view as a redraft of the first sentence:- We will study method of compensating Sheikh of Foweit for dispossession suggested in paragraph 3 Os. your telegram No.70. Prima facie, however,'I doubt whether it would provide a satisfactory 'solution”. [ie This le a v es the question open while stating iveii certain objections to Humphrys ? plan; and should produce from him a rather more detailed explanation , t of what he means.

The situation created by the Law Officers' Opinion on the rights of the sheikhs of Koweit and Mohanmerah under the guarantees given them in 1914 by H.to.G. has since been considered in two interdepartmental meetings at the Foreign oil ice, at tne second of wnich Colonel Powle was present. The proceedings of the first meeting are on P.Z.2426/33. In the light of the discussion the Foreign Office telegram of 13th April on P.2.2218 was sent to sir Francis Humphrys. The .ambassador’s reply is on P.Z.2373* It was regarded as by no means satisfactory and a further telegram to clear up various doubtful points was sent to Baghdad on 25th April (P.Z.2408). Sir Francis Humphry s' further reply did not advance natters materially. It is on P.Z.2442. 2. The correspondence which had passed was further considered at the second interdepartmental meeting referred to above which took place on 1st May. The minutes of this meeting are not yet available. But the general line which commended itself to the Departments’ representatives present is set out in the draft telegrams to Baghdad in which our concurrence is now invited. It will oe seen that the position is broadly that we are anxious to do a u eal with the Iraq government under which they would validate tde title of the Sheikh of Koweit to his Faddaghiyeh property (and possibly to the small j property of B&amp;shiyeh' which he also runs the risk of j losing'), H.M.G. in return making a composition in respect of future tax exemption. It would be necessary as part of any compromise of this nature to secure from/4/ a. j ! i m l from the Iraq Government- an undertaking that in the event of our assuming liability tor the Istihlak tax they would not discriminate in the matter of taxation t against the Sheikhs in the future, and the amount of compensation would also need to oe carefully worked out. We need not go into this point at the moment, hut on an aspect of it of importance to this Office it may he recorded that I have continued to maintain the attitude that no financial assistance of any kind can he looked fo r from In dian revenues. I get increasingly the impression that the Treasury may he prepared to acquiesce in this in the last resort. 3. There is general agreement as to the objection to taking a case of this kind to arbitration if it can possibly he avoided. The meeting on 1st lay thought, however, that some tactical advantage might he gained from use of the threat of arbitration, although it also agreed that it was most important that we should know precisely ii how strong our case was likely to he if the worst came to the worst. It was agreed^£hat simultaneously with the reference to Baghdad to he made in the draft telegrams now attached a reference should he made to the Law Officers for advice as to the strength of our case. If they advise that we have in fact at least as good a case as on the occasion of the last reference (when they thought we had a reasonable chance of success) our hands will he strengthened in using the threat with Iraq. If, on the other hand, they advise that our position is a had one the threat would have to he used with very much greater caution.

My dear Laithwaite, Many thanks for letting me see in draft your despatcn to the Political Resident on the subject of the proposed formal protest by the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. We concur generally in the terms of the proposed protest, but suggest that it would be well to omit the final phrase;- ’’and that the amounts already so collected should be refunded to the Sheikh.” 'this might, we think, draw from the Iraqi Government a formal claim in respect of arrears of tax since 1921. We certainly do not want to encourage the presentation of such a claim, which, once having been officially put forward, the Iraqi Government might subsequently find it difficult to withdraw without ’loss of face. ’ Otherwise we have no alterations to suggest. 3. Perhaps you would send us officially a copy of the despatch when it has been sent off, in order that we may send a copy to Humphrys for his information.

'Ehe Ambassador said that he would like to consider first the actual present legal situation with regard to the two suits, BasMysh and Fa&amp;daghiyah. Lieut,-Col cmel Fowle pointed out that, til though the Shaikh had lost the B&amp;shlyah suit in the Appeal Court, it still apparently reniained open to him to apply for revision If he did so, he would have to again accept the jurisdiction which might prejudice him in the matter of the Faddaghiy&amp;k suits on the other hand, Els Majesty f s Goyerament might take the rim that he should exhaust all legal remedies open to him before coming to them for compensation. The Jh&amp;ixh had two grounds on which he might base his claim for revision:- (a) that the Court had improperly refused to admit evidence that he was In possession prior to • 1®» and (b) that the 'Iraq hand Act should override the provisions of the Mejelle. If he was right on either of these two points the suit wr.o statute barred. a claim by Court, T.h with revia only per mi party coni had/M d u . r,., „ tJ tta »r »»« material aoanmeat.

Jummonaea had been isaued by these eo-heirs but the Shaikh had refused to aooeyt them. If ultimately the shaikh accepted Jurisdiction, presumably the points raised by Colonel Fowl© could he urged again on behalf of the Shaikh. The Anbassador asked Colonel Fowl© how far he thought the Shaikh had been prejudiced by the advice given to him before the war by His Majesty 1 a Government on the question of his acceptance of Turkish nationality. Colonel Fowl© replied that it looked as if the Shaikh could have acquired a fapu title quit© easily had he been willing to accept Turkish nationality. The Resident in the Gulf at that time certainly advised him not to do so, as it was His Majesty*s Government’s policy to keep the Shaikh under their influence• Lieut.-Colonel Fowl© said that, as regards the Fad&amp;aghiyah suit, the Shaikh was going to give as hi® reasons for refusal to accept service of the summons, that, as aa inde pendent ruler, he was not amenable to th© jurisdiction of the ’Iraqi courts. Mr. Mhill said that this would 'be a valuable delaying move. He did not, however, think that the point m&amp; gooa in International law as the suit concerned immovable situated within the jurisdiction little further The ambassador stated that in his vie could be done until the opinion of theCrown on the general aneation of ^ ° n or tixe guarantee was reoeived.

My dear Laithwaite, I think it is as well that I should send to you a copy of a letter which I have sent to Hall today on the subject of our Meeting about the Law Officers* Opinion. I did not at the Meeting explicitly make the point to which reference is made in my letter to Hall, but I am clear it is one which the Treasury cannot altogether ignore. I expect, as a matter of fact, that Humphrys will have some thing to say in regard to it. Yours sincerely,80th April f 1935. «Cy dear Hall, Thank you for your letter of yesterday and the enclosed copy of a note of our meeting about the Law Officers 1 Opinion. 1 should be grateful if you would cone Her the following redraft of paragraph b on page 4;~ 'Mr. Woods explained that he had sot had an opportunity to consult higher authority and was not therefore in a position to commit Treasury Ministers to any particular view. He agreed that the Opinion of the Law Officers destroyed the argument against arbitration which had previously been advanced by the treasury, namely, that there was no legal obligation arising from the tanas of the undertakings given to the She ike .

Woods exolalneu that he hau not hau an opportunity to consult higher authority anu was not therefore in a position to eoim;;it Treasury klnlsters to any particular view* He agreed that the opinion of the Law Officers destroyed the argument against arbitration which had previously been advanced by the Treasury, namely, that there was no legal obligation arising from the terms of the undertakings given to the Sheikhs. 6* It was, however, the general opinion of the meeting that a reference to arbitration would be open to definite political objections* It would be necessary to disclose the terms of the letter aauressed to the i helkh of Lohami«erah« hi ch contained passage a likely/Itteelgr to cause r«aont*eiit la ^ersls^ a public aianute of this klmi between Hie i.ajrst^’e Government ana the Iraqi Govenment so eoon after the terjr.inatlon of the sanuatory rigine could scarcely fall to errata an unfortunate Impression at Geneva.

The substance of that letter, if not the actual ternu , must, he thought ; by now be well known to the Persian Government. The Iraqi Government a*ght, or might not, attempt reprisals on the iheiKh of loweit. If they aid, it would be the duty of l!is Lajesty’s Government to take all possible steps to afford him protection. He admitted the force of the political objections to arbitration, but thought that they should be faced and dealt with as they arose.

The Case (drafted after consultation with this Office) and the opinion of the Law Officers on the points raised in it is on F.Z.1890/33 now attached. recorded an opinion decisively in favour of the Sheikhs on all points. Not only in their view does ' the imposition of tne Istihlak tax on the produce of the date gardens of either Sheikh represent a breach of the undertakings given in November 1914 of such a nature that an obligation rests on H.L.G. to compensate the Sheikhs for it, but H#L.G. are under a definite obligation to compensate the Sheikh of Koweit in respect of any portion of the gardens in the possession of his predecessor in 1914 of which he may be deprived in consequence of a judgment of the competent Iraqi Courts. On this last point tne test to be applied is whether the then Sheikh of Koweit was, at the date of the undertaking, de fa cto_ in possession of the portions of the gardens affected by the judgment. satisfactory so far as we are concerned, for we have consistently maintained the view now upheld by the outbreak of the war, that the date gardens which they then possessed in Iraq would remain free of taxation It will be seen that the Law Officers have This, for the moment, is entirely2 .

So far as we and the Government of Ihaia are concerned the result for the moment is entire satisfactory, for the Law Officers have adopted the view which has consistently been held by us. The Foreign Office are considering the question of future procedure, but it seems not unlikely (while everything must turn on the results of inter- . departmental discussion with which we will keep you in touch) that.in view of the definite indication by the Law Officers that a substantial financial obligation cannot be refused by H.k.G. in the event of their proving unable to persuade the Iraq Government to implement the pledges given in 1914 in their entirety, it may be decided to refer — CZ4 M ft ^ -not o-niy the questionjyof the Istihlak tax tat the right of the Sheikh of Koweit to uninterrupted possession of his gardens under the terms of the 1914 agreement,to arbitration or tothe Hague Court. Z. We, us you know, in agreement with the Government of India, have consistently maintained the view that no financial liability in connection with any breach of the 1914 engagements can fall on Indian revenues. Our reasons are substantial. In the first place, the expenditure involved is expenditure of a nature which can properly be regarded as covered by India's contribution of £100,000,000 to the cost of the war. In the secon d place -( th nt+rh r- n n^y trS'-put Ji / S ; /{.A . ‘vTf- \ 5 V- A A'V this in-ufficri^l corrosponuence- in- to bdunt a famhiun- 7 . the failure cj- k definitely to transfer the bllotions in question to the 10' j/A /x&lt; P Cc ^} present Iraq Government, is not -the jeailt of tho -Gov-»rnii&gt; Q nt In^ia l&gt;ut- &lt;T t lv-rrj- , v r i&lt;i,(rno■■-re cuit of unsat isfactory— haling of the-case l)y~~TZnn?oTan±iz±- Off4ree.

GOVERNMENT IN 1914 CASE FOR THE OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN AND OPINION THEREON \ r/''-18786 The Date Gardens in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah Scope of undertakings given by H. M. Government in 1914 CASE FOR THE OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN AND OPINION THEREON 1. This case raises certain questions respecting the nature and scope of undertakings given by His Majesty's Government in 1914 to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah (documents 1 and 2 in the Appendix, pp. 8 and 9), upon which the Treasury desire to have the opinion of the Law Officers. 2. Certain aspects of the problems raised by these under takings were submitted to the Law Officers in May, 1930, by the Colonial Office. The questions then submitted related in the main to issues which had arisen as between His Majesty s Government and the Iraqi Government. The question which now Jails to be considered is whether m the circumstances hereinafter described any legal obligation rests on His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis the Sheikhs themselves. 3. The circumstances in which the undertakings in question came to be given can, so far as they are relevant to the present question, be stated shortly as follows : 4 In 1914 His Majesty’s Government were desirous of obtain- ing the assistance of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah against Turkey, and letters were accordingly addressed to them by the Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gu , in nature of the assistance desired was indicated and certain prom se^ were made in return. The letters, documents 1 and m PP dix, were in different terms but for present purposes it is necess V only to quote the following extracts. In he letter to the Sheikh of Koweit dated 3rd November, 1914, the following passage occurs “ Furthermore I make to you, on behalf of ^e Bntm Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, yi „ your gardens which are now in your possesion viz tS date gardens situate between Fao In the letted to the 7 Sheikh of Mohammerah dated 21st Novem ber, 1914, it was stated :— , . , on ' / the Shithei-Aiib shall remain in full ptSftoutdV beirs and immune from taxa- t ^ on '” • i. t fiiA AYrvression “ immune from The reason why a v y iant ° h sheikh 0 f Koweit is explained taxation ” appears in the letter to the SheiKb in paragraph 13 below. A. ' 5. The date gardens referred to in these letters are situated in territory which has become part of Iraq. Iraq is now an inde pendent sovereign state and the literal fulfilment of the under takings in question could therefore only have been rendered possible if His Majesty’s Government had retained some measure of control over the Government of Iraq or had placed upon that Government an express treaty obligation to concede the immunity from taxa tion to which the undertakings refer. Unfortunately this was not done and His Majesty’s Government have since found it impossible to induce the Iraqi Government to admit any obligation in the matter; and for various reasons (into which it is unnecessary for the present purpose to enter) it has not been thought desirable to submit the dispute between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq, upon which your predecessors advised in 1930, to the Permanent Court of International Justice, or any other international tribunal. Since therefore His Majesty’s Government are not in a position tp give literal effect to the undertakings given to the Sheikhs, the question arises whether there is a legal obligation on His Majesty’s Government to pay compensation to the Sheikhs on account of certain events relating to the date gardens now taking place in Iraq, upon the assumption that His Majesty’s Government fail to prevent them. This question must depend, in the first place, on whether these events are or are not contrary to the promises to the Sheikhs referred to in the preceding paragraph, and this is the matter upon which the opinion of the Law Officers is now desired. The events in question are (a) the levy upon the produce of these gardens by the Iraqi Government of a particular kind of tax called the Istihlak tax; (b) the institution by private persons in Iraq of proceedings in the Iraq courts (hitherto successful) for the recovery of possession from the Sheikh of Koweit of certain of the gardens possessed by him. There are therefore two separate questions, and it will be convenient to deal with (a) first. 6. For some time after the creation of the Kingdom of Iraq, the system of taxation in that territory included a tax on land based upon and fundamentally similar to the Turkish tax which was in force at the time when the undertakings were given to the Sheikhs. The method of determining the amount of the tax varied according to the nature of the fand, the character of the crops, the system of irrigation employed, etc.; but in the case of the large estates in Basra similar to the properties of the Sheikhs the assessment was based on a valuation of the area under cultivation. The tax was in all cases payable bv the landowner, leaseholder or occupier of the land in question. It is not disputed that the levy of this tax upon the Sheikhs would have been contrary to the promises of His Majesty’s Government and although this tax was as a matter of Iraqi law considered to be exigible in respect of the date gardens owned by the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, the High Com missioner was able, by putting pressure on the Iraqi authorities from time to time, to induce them to refrain from actually collect ing it. 7. In dune, 1931, however, a new system of taxation was introduced which replaced the previous tax upon land by a tax upon produce. The text of the law instituting this tax will be found in document No. 3 in the Appendix, p. 9 et seq. Under this law no tax is imposed upon land as such, nor is any produce which is re tained for consumption by the occupier of the land or his family subject to tax. The new tax, which is known as the “ Istihlak tax,” is levied only upon that portion of the produce of land which is sold or stored or transformed into another shape by artificial means, or exported from Iraq. It is collected not from the land- owner or occupier as such, but from the person who sells the produce or from the exporter who ships it abroad who may or may not bethe owner or occupier of the land yielding the produce Thus int its method of assessment and collection the tax is somewhat similar to an excise or export duty. 8. The collection of the new tax in respect of the produce of the Sheikhs’ date gardens is now being enforced, and the first of the two questions on which the opinion of the Law Officers is desired is whether the levy of this tax on the produce of these date gardens involves a breach of the undertakings given to the Sheikhs in 1914 that their date gardens should be immune fro m taxes or imposts- or from taxation as the case may be. It will be appreciated that in their capacity as proprietors of these gardens the Sheikhs will not be called upon to pay any tax, but in so far as they themselves, or their agents, sell or export the produce of the gardens they will be liable to pay the Istihlak tax on the produce thus sold or ex ported. It should be mentioned, however, although the point is. not strictly relevant to the legal question in issue, that the pro visions of the new law will in practice press with particular hard ship on the Sheikhs, since they do not reside in Iraq and con sequently all produce which may be used for their own consumption and the maintenance of their families and retainers and which is necessarily taken out of Iraq will be liable to the tax; whereas a person residing in Iraq will be exempt from the tax in respect of such part of the produce of his property as is consumed in loco. 9. The issue can therefore be shortly stated as follows, viz. :— whether the date gardens in question must be regarded as “ subject to the payment of taxes or imposts ” in the one case or as no longer “ immune from taxation ” in the other, by reason of the fact that this tax is levied on all the produce of those gardens sold or ex ported from Iraq. 10. In view of the circumstances in which the undertakings- were given and the parties to the bargain thus made, it is doubtful whether any assistance can be obtained from any decisions of t e English Courts relating to statutory exemptions from taxation Reference may however be made to two well-known cases, ine bes known case is probably that of the Associated New supers Limited v. City of London Corporation (1926 2 A.C. 429) m which it was. decided that the Statute 7 Geo, 3 c. 37, which authorised various improvements in the City of London and provided {inter aia) a land reclaimed from the bed of the Thames should vest in t ie owners of the adjoining land “ free from all taxes and assessmen s w a soever ”, extended not only to taxes and assessments m exis ence a the time the Act was passed, but also to taxes and assessments sub sequently imposed and which were not mere substi u es or suc existed when the Statute first became operative, n e presen c it clearly cannot even be suggested that ttie undertaking give outbreak of war in 1914 had regard only to existing tax ^^ . _ posed under Turkish laws; indeed the basis o ® n ? was that the territory in question would, it w T as con e &gt; P ’ cease to be under Turkish rule. 11. The only other case to which it is thought the attention of the Law Officers might perhaps be drawn &gt; s th ^° f Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works Ltd. (191 ' p h w .fi, t p e the Privy Council decided that where under an a 0 exemption City Corporation the company were entitle o could from taxation ” for ten years on certain land, the company could not b. called upon to «?**“£,hick prodded tb.t should contribute to its cost according , ■ point of the remarks in the iudgment in this case respecting the point or tL frl which a Cmuf is likely to consider cases where one party. A 9t&gt;o ci bargain involving relief from taxation claims that he has per formed all that he has promised to do, may perhaps be regarded as of general application. 12. In the present case there can be little doubt that the Istihlak is a “ tax ” strictly so called; and the question therefore appears to be whether on their true construction and having regard to the circumstances in which and the persons to whom they were given the undertakings given to the Sheikhs extend to taxation not levied on the gardens themselves as such but on their produce. Do they, for example, extend only to taxes creating a liability which arises from the simple fact of occupation or ownership of land, or do they include also a tax creating liability which only arises if the landowner chooses to export or sell some part of the produce of that land, and then payable not by the landowner as such, but by the seller or exporter. 13. It is important to examine the actual language used in the undertakings given to the two Sheikhs. When the drafts were under consideration in 1914 the wording approved for both letters was “ The date gardens which you now possess .... shall remain in the full possession of you’ and your heirs and be immune from taxation ”. An authenticated copy of the actual Arabic letter received by the Sheikh of Koweit has been obtained. The words in this which correspond to “ immune from taxation ” in the English draft are Arabic words which are literally translated ‘‘ without there being upon them anvthing in the nature of taxes or imposts . Evidently Colonel Knox/the writer of the Arabic letter, used two more or less synonymous Arabic words to give the sense of taxation quite generally and comprehensively. (There is no reason to suppose that the Arabic of the letter sent to the Sheikh of Mohammerah is not the same as that of the letter sent to the Sheikh of Koweit in the particular, but as copy of it is not available here, the copy sent herewith follows the original English draft). It will thus be seen that the pledge in regard to taxation is quite general and not ex pressed as limited to particular kinds of taxes. At the same time it seems clear that this exemption is not a personal exemption simpliciter in the sense that it implies that the Sheikh is entitled to reside in. the gardens and claim to be exempt from all taxation of every kind which may be imposed on persons resident in Iraq; it is quite definitely linked up with the possession of the gardens and it seems reasonable therefore to limit it to taxation the liability to which is closely connected with the gardens themselves. 14. It is necessary to consider very closely the exact nature of the tax recently imposed. It may be regarded on the one hand as merely a trader's tax in the sense that it is primarily a tax on produce sold or exported; or on the other it may be regarded as merely a variant of the earlier form of tax based on the value of the land under cultivation and therefore as bearing a very close re semblance to that tax. 15. Admittedly the earlier form of tax fell within the terms of the undertaking and the question is therefore whether in all the circumstances the present tax can be regarded as so far divorced from the land itself as to bring it outside the terms used by the Resident in his letter. As has been explained above, the new tax is not levied on the landowner as such and may indeed not be pai by the Landowner himself at all except in so far as he may by reason of its existence have to accept a lesser price for his produce. It is therefore a tax on produce, but not on the produce as sue of any particular garden or plantation; nor does the produce attract the tax until it has been severed and has been sold or ex ported. But since neither of the Sheikhs is resident in Iraq, the whole of the produce of their gardens (other than that consumed ythe resident cultivators) does in fact attract the tax in the process of being sent to their places of residence for the consumption of their families and retainers. 16. Two views of the matter may it is thought conceivably be taken : (1) that the undertaking ought to be beneficially con strued in the light of the practical effect of the new tax; and that as the Sheikhs are necessarily resident elsewhere than in Iraq, and since the produce of their gardens will with only trifling exceptions, always and necessarily attract the tax, because the produce is always and necessarily exported from Iraq for their consumption, the tax in their case is in fact a tax upon the produce of their gardens and therefore within the undertakings; and (2) that the undertakings are limited to taxes levied on the land itself and upon the owner ship or occupation of the land, and the Istihlak tax is not a tax on land but on produce as such, divorced from the ownership or occupation of land, and therefore not within the terms of either undertaking. 17. To turn now to the second question which affects only the gardens in the possession of the Sheikh of Koweit. It appears that certain legal proceedings have been instituted against him in the Iraqi Courts at the suit of private persons claiming to be entitled to part of the gardens in his possession. In one such case the Court of Cassation at Baghdad has decided on appeal in favour of the plaintiff; and further proceedings of a similar nature are pending. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the pledge given to the Sheikh in 1914 imposes on His Majesty’s Government any obligation in respect of such portions, of the gardens in his physical possession in 1914 as the Iraqi Courts may decide are not the Sheikh’s property. It is clearly beyond the power of His Majesty’s Government to maintain the Sheikh in physical possession of property in Iraq which may be declared by the Iraqi Courts not to belong to him, and any liability must therefore be for payment of compensation. 18. The answer to this question would seem to depend on vhether the undertaking given in 1914 ought, on its true construc- ion, to be regarded as applying to a given area of land ol which e Sheikh was at that time in physical possession or whether it relates mly to such portions of that area as legally belong to him; m o her vords, has the pledge that certain gardens “ shall remain m his mssession ” any application to property of which the fehei i is lispossessed by the ordinary process of law, and as the resu o &amp; [udgment in the Iraqi Courts? It is thought that the circu- itances in which the pledge was given must be taken into accou .. 19. The general history of the case is contained in the accom- janying Memorandum by the Political Agent, Kowei , , So. 4 in. the appendix, p. 16. The essential points are firstly hat from 1899 onwards His Majesty s Government were anxio » establish their political position m Koweit in the face o ilaims by the Turks that the Sheikh was an Ottoman subject th vith this end in view H.M.G. entered into secret engagements with he Sheikh; that in the years 1907 and following the Sheikh made ;ertain large purchases of land in the then vi ^ye Dr essure he Turkish authorities, apparently with a view .,,. r f n ,,f. { or the :o bear on the Sheikh, refused to allow him to arrange for the leccssarv aDnearance before the Tapu department, with a view lecessary appearancei utuu o i r was required by law, or x&gt; declaring the validity o± the saie, as . , v-ek ij? ;o allow him to take possession, unless e r ^ i i -i Sheikh to lurkish national; that consequent on an n Sality H.M.G. he was instructed not to take ^ oapers but to have ^“^thaTgeneral discussions over this 18786H.M.G. and the Turkish Government until 1911, when they be- ’came merged in negotiations for the regularisation of the various questions in issue between H.M.G. and the Turkish Government in this area. Those negotiations culminated in the Anglo- Turkish Convention signed by the representatives of both parties on 29th July 1913. A section of the Convention in question regularised the position of the Sheikh of Koweit vis-a-vis both the Turkish and British Governments; and, with the history of the dispute which had taken place over the date gardens in view, one of the articles of the section in question provided that the Sheikh should enjoy in full security and in accordance with Otto man Law the rights of private property which he possessed in the Vilayet of Basra. This convention had not been ratified, how ever, when war broke out with Turkey in 1914. 20. From the copy of the Judgment given by the Court of Cassation in Baghdad which is also enclosed (document No. 5 in the Appendix, p. 19) it will be seen that the failure of the Sheikh to take the formal steps necessary in regard to the registration of the documents of title with the Turkish authorities before the War, as described above, is one of the grounds on which he may be -adjudged not to be the lawful owner of the gardens of which he is in possession and that it appears to have been strongly urged upon the Court. It is not clear whether this omission was or was not in itself a vital point in the decision already given, in the sense that but for this point the decision would have been in favour of the Sheikh, but it may well be thought in view of the history of matter prior to the giving of the undertakings, which is set out in the Memorandum of the Political Agent (No. 4, p. 16) that to the extent to which it was vital in that case or may be vital in -any similar case which may be brought against the Sheikh here after, His Majesty’s Government cannot refuse to recognise an obligation to compensate the Sheikh for any loss which he may have suffered as the result of his refusal to take the necessary steps to register his title because that involved his acceptance of the position of a subject of Turkey, and that would have been contrary to the policy which His Majesty’s Government were urging upon him It is clear that the question of the registration of his title to the gardens and the then recent difficulties created by non- registration must have been fresh in the minds of the Sheikh and qu n • I^ es i-d en t ti me when the undertaking to the oheikh was given in 1914. In this connection it may be significant that the first draft of the letter to be sent to the Sheikh in 1914 read. your date gardens between Fao and Gurneh shall remain m the lull possession of you and your heirs . . . . ”, and that the overnment of India deliberately directed the replacement of the wor s your^date gardens ” by the words “ date gardens which you now possess It was in consequence of this change in the draft “ r0 vf rnm€n f India that the pledge in the letter sent , . J 3 klimkh 0 f 3rd November actually reads :—“ Your gardens which are now in your possession ^ ' * i e ljaw JJmcers will also see from the Memorandum b at (Acting Judicial Adviser to the Iraq Govern i i ;• °‘ ^ la appendix, p. 21, that there are grounds fo i- 111 ? w f ie f^ er the decision of the Court on the question of th tn 1 f 11 °f 5 1 ei&gt; f ain Ihws relating to the period of time necessar; f -/rw a i Averse possession is correct.

The Sheikh doe;18786 7 not hesitate to allege something akin to a conspiracy to de-prive him of his gardens on political grounds, and the Law Officers may be of opinion that in these circumstances it is incumbent on His Majesty’s Government to examine for themselves the basis of any decision against the Sheikh; and that if, as the result of that examination, in the course of which opinions would of course be obtained from experts in Ottoman law, it should be decided that the decision against the Sheikh is contrary to the justice of the case, His Majesty’s Government come under a legal obligation to compensate the Sheikh for property which was then in his posses sion, but of which on this basis he has been wrongfully deprived. THE LAW OFFICERS are requested to advise :— 1. Whether having regard to the terms of the under takings given in 1914, the imposition of the Istihlak tax on the produce of the date gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Mohammerah involves any breach of those undertakings and whether as a result any obligation rests on His Majesty’s Government to compensate the Sheikhs. 2. Whether His Majesty’s Government are under any obligation to compensate the Sheikh of Koweit in respect of any portion of the gardens in the possession of his pre decessor in 1914 of which he may be deprived in consequence of a Judgment of the competent Iraqi Courts. 3. Whether it is material for the purposes of the last question to consider (a) wffiether the basis of the judgment of the Iraqi Courts is the failure by the Sheikh to register certain documents in 1914; that failure having been admittedly due to the fact that the Sheikh, in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty’s Govern ment, refused to declare himself a Turkish subject, or (b) whether the Judgment of the Iraqi Courts is- or is not in accordance with the justice of the case; that is to say whether in the event of His Majesty’s Government being of opinion that the decision of the Iraqi Courts is wrong, any liability to compensate the Sheikh arises. 4.

Letter dated 3rd November, 1914, from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Ruler of Kuwait and Dependencies, Kuwait. After compliments, In continuation of previous letter intimating the outbreak of war oetween the British Government and Turkey, I am ordered by the British Government to convey to your Excellency gratitude for your loyalty and your offer of assistance, and to request you to attack Umm Qasr Safwan and Bubiyan and to occupy them. You should endeavour, afterwards, in co-operation with Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, Amir Abdul Azin bin Saud and other • reliable Shaikhs to liberate Basrah from Turkish possession. Should this prove to be beyond your ability, you should make arrangements, if possible, to prevent Turkish reinforcements from reaching Basrah or even Qurnah, until the arrival of the British troops whom we shall send, please God, as soon as possible. I also hope that two of our men- of-war will reach Basrah before the arrival of your troops there. And though it should be your highest aim, in this connection, to liberate Basrah and its people from Turkish rule, still we request that you should use your utmost endeavour in preventing troops and others from plundering the merchandise belonging to British mer chants in Basrah and its dependencies, to protect the European resi dents of Basrah and to safeguard them from loss and oppression. In return for your valuable assistance in this important matter, I am ordered by the British Government to promise to Your Excellency that if we succeed therein—and we shall succeed therein, please God—we will not return Basrah to the Turkish Government, and we will not surrender it back to them at all. Furthermore I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, viz. :— (1) that your gardens which are now in your posses sions, viz., the date gardens situate between Fao and Qurnah, shall remain in your possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts; (2) that if you attack Safwan, Umm Qasr and Bubiyan and occupy them, the British Government will protect you from any consequences arising from that action; (3) that the British Government does recognise and admit that the Shaikhdom of Kuwait is an independent Government under British protection. I request that you will be good enough to read the enclosed letter and transmit the same to the Amir of Najd at the earliest convenience. I have addressed a letter to the Shaikh of Moham- merah similar to this I am writing you. I am confident of your old-established friendship with the exalted Government, and I believe that Your Excellency will use your endeavour in these important matters, in every respect. I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you of my high esteem, and may you continue to remain preserved and salaams. (Signed) S. G. KNOX, Resident and H.B.M.’s Consul General in the Persian Gulf.DOCUMENT 2.

In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoked attack by a foreign power or against any encroachment by such power on your jurisdiction, and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Persian Government provided that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of His Majesty’s Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Vis-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain Your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. Further, the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-al-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxation. (Signed) P. Z.

(List.) DOCUMENT 4. Memorandum by the Political Agent, Koweit. Note on a conversation which the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had with the Shaikh of Kuwait on 25th October, 1931, regarding the new Iraq “ Istihlah ” tax, with special reference to the effect such tax would have on the Kuwait properties on the Shatt-al-Arab. if it were enforced. In the course of a general conversation on this subject and in reply to several questions put by the Honourable the Political Resi dent, the Shaikh made the following points. Under the old system, a garden owner had to pay his tax according to the number of “ jaribs ” he owned, and not according to the number or size of his date trees. This shortly was the system in force in Turkish times in Basrah. In the Muntafik and some other Liwas, the system was different, and a tax was levied on each date tree a garden owner possessed, and to encourage the owner to cultivate the ground under the trees, which improved the country side and incidentally the palm-tree itself, a reduction was made in the rate of tax taken per tree in accordance as the garden was “ amar ” (cultivated) or “ kharab (uncultivated).In Basrah therefore if a man had a large garden and a small area under dates he stood to lose as compared to the man who had a small or even similar sized garden which was all under dates. It was the discontent caused by the above system which prob ably brought the new proposed tax into the sphere of practical politics. Actually there was method in the Turks “ madness ” for behind the idea was the desire to encourage landlords who were careless garden owners like the “ Saadun ” families to put down an in creased number of date trees each year, by penalizing the man with a large area and few trees in favour of the man who took the trouble to grow the maximum number of trees possible on his plot of land. 2. When asked how the collection of the new tax would work in the case of an ordinary garden owner who lived on his property, the Shaikh replied that as far as he understood the proposed new law which he had read, the garden owner would, after cutting down his dates, put what he, his family and fellaheen required for their own personal use, on one side. This would not be subject to taxation. The balance he would collect on his “ sif ” i.e., the river bank, until he could find a buyer. Such buyer coming along, would pay cash down for what he bought, and remove the dates, either for export by dhow or steamer. As such buyer would eventually have to pay the “ ashur ” or 10 per cent government date tax, he naturally would deduct this amount from the price paid for the dates, i.e., the market price, while each year is fixed by a com mittee for the whole of the Basrah date area, and would still further have to allow for his own profit, after deducting carriage expenses to dhow or ship, packing, etc. It was of course the buyer’s business also to keep in touch with the Customs authorities, take out necessary documents, and pay the “Ashur” tax. The garden owner had no responsibility in this direction at all. Should, on the other hand, the garden owner in question be faced with a bad year, and be unable to find a buyer at all, then his produce remained with him, and was either thrown into the river, or sold for a song, to'wandering shepherds, Bedouin or other migrating elements, who during the date season are usually to be found camped on the desert side of gardens seeking what they can pick up cheap or steal. . The garden owner in this case pays nothing to Government and the latter loses the “ Ashur ” tax due from his dates. 3. The Political Eesident then asked the Shaikh how he thought the new law would work if applied to the five great iluw ai properties situate on the lower reaches of the Shatt-al-Ara The Shaikh without hesitation replied that it would fall harder on himself than, if he had to pay the ordinary jaub axa ion, as used to exist. 4. When asked to explain how he arrived at this conclusion, the Shaikh pointed out :— (a) That he was not in the same position as resident garden owner, for he was both an absen ee ^ , worse, resided outside Iraq. Actually e ^ P ^ “ fallahs ” (or gardeners) in the gardens and these weie _ only persons who resided there. Hence un ®r their only these resident fellaheen would be en i remaining share of dates free of taxation, while e , . r^ uwa j t TOO branch families of the al-Subah ^ would presumably have to pay tne , ■ j ,,,, i. n the large stores of dates, garden produce, fruit, wood palm fronds, barley, fodder, lucerne g rass - •&gt; , t ] )e annnallv brought to Kuwait for their own use, under tne plea that they had been exported from the garden areas, and also out of Iraq.In this connection the Shaikh pointed out that the amounts brought to Kuwait by himself did not merely include that share of tlie garden produce which he and the 100 junior families of the al-Subah (numbering some 1,000 souls, i sup pose), had a right to, in their capacity as joint shareholders in the estates, but included the annual free food ration of his body-guard and paid “ hdawi ” land forces numbering some 500 men who with their families all received half their pay in kind and half in cash. The former apart from rice (obtained in India), was practically all obtained from the produce of his Shatt-al-Arab estates. (b) Again in the matter of the date produce which the Shaikh “exported” overseas to India, the Red Sea, Zanzibar, etc., the Shaikh pointed out that he came under a different category to the ordinary garden owner of Basrah or the well-known Arab and European merchants who annually bought up and exported dates from Basrah seeing that in a sense he was both owner and exporter. And while the latter class, both Arab and Europeans, purchased direct from individual garden owners and paid cash down for the produce, he as Shaikh of Kuwait sold nothing to these ex porting merchants but instead dealt with his own merchants of Kuwait who nearly all owned regular fleets of dhow, “ East Indian men ” which made annual voyages to either India, the Red Sea, East Africa or Zanzibar, taking as out ward cargoes Basrah dates, and bringing back ship-loads of wood, beams, spices, rice, building material, etc. The system under which this export business was conducted was as follows :— The Shaikh, who it must not be forgotten runs his estate on our old feudal lines, annually and before the dates are ripe sends for his leading Kuwait merchants (largely also pearl dealers) and enquiries if any of them will take up cargoes of dates from his estates. The response is generally good, and that part of the produce of the gardens previously ear marked for overseas export, is now sold to these local merchants. The method of sale is as follows:—The dates are sold by the gosara (basket) at the rate pre vailing at Basrah, but no cash passes hands, instead the buyers sign documents promising to pay the Shaikh his money, after one, two or three voyages (i.e., years), as the case may be, and only after they have disposed of their return cargoes. These signed docu ments are deposited with the Shaikh, who recovers his money gradually, and by a method which bears easily on his merchants and keeps his overseas dhow trade alive. Under this method dhow captains on behalf of their principals do the actual trading and with the money which they realise from the sale of the dates they carry, they buy their return cargoes. In bad trading years as at present return cargoes fetch little, and often merchants have to ask the Shaikh for an extension of the period of repayment. The latter naturally assists more often than not, for his policy is literally to be the “ father of his people.” 5. Taking therefore the above two systems (paragraph 4 (a) and (5) for dealing with the produce of his date gardens in Iraq, it was clear, the Shaikh pointed out, that he himself would have to find the “ Ashur ” tax both in the case of :— {a) Dates and garden produce exported to Kuwait for state purposes. (5) Dates exported to foreign countries by Kuwait dhow , owners.19 \ In the former case, because, according to the letter of the law the goods would be taxable, he being the owner-exporter of the produce, and in the latter case because the merchants exporters (the dhow- owners) would not be paying for the dates till they returned from India, etc., and had disposed of their return cargoes. Xhey would naturally expect the Shaikh to pay the Iraq date-tax on the top of the credit he had given, they promising to pay same back on settlement day. 6. Even if it could be arranged by negotiation with the Iraq Government that the produce sent to Kuwait (for family and state use), paragraph 4 (a), should be exempt from taxation, the Shaikh pointed out that much irritating accounting and checking by officials, at both ends would be involved, and he did not see how in any case, he could avoid having to deposit large guarantee sums to the various Iraq officials in control, which would only be released after docu ments had been received from Kuwait to say that the goods had arrived. The conforming to such cumbersome and irritating methods before he could get the produce of his own gardens to Kuwait was in view 7 of the Shaikh unthinkable, especially as it w 7 ould lay Kuwait open to the danger of perpetual demands from rapacious junior Iraq officials for largesse, etc. (Sgd.)

Translation of a decree No. 66/932 dated 9th May, 1932, by the Court of Appeal, Baghdad, for service on Shaikh Ahmad Jabir A1 Sabah, Ruler of Kuwait. Appellor : Shaikh Ahmad A1 Jabir A1 Sabah (Defendant). Represented by Lawyer Iskandar Mansur Erlendi. Appellee : Rafi’ah daughter of ’Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair (Plaintiff). Represented by Lawyer Kamal Effendi A1 Sanawi. The Iraqi Court of Revision, formed of Daud Effendi Samrah Vice-President, and ’Abdullah Effendi Salam and Antoine Effe^ Shammas, Members, empowered to adjudica e m Anneal Majesty the King of Iraq, met in its capacity as a Courtot App on 9th May, 1932, and passed the following judgment. The Plaintiff submitted a complaint to Court o ^Pirst Instance, Basrah, stating that she ^ i • ^ w j 1 i c h of land which is situated at Faddaghiya!, e ^ther. As the are known, transferred to her from her fa er , nrohibited Defendant is opposing her she requests that e P from opposing her and that he should pay e (c ) • On 30th December, 1931, the cour f V^fpfdant fro^ ment in the case No. 77/31 prohibiting te e , t j? 216 the Plaintiff in (the administration the shares, shares, and what has been transferred 0 oV, ar p S 0 f the plot of belonging to her mother Shafiqah, on of 12 ^ feeg ag it land under dispute, and compelling n P y p, - an q ^ been proved in the Khaqani regis er ^ plaintiff’s mother brothers and sisters own 85 shares a , r haye trans- owned 27 shares which, at the deat if has been proved that ferred to her heirs including bases the person now administering the 1 p. document his ownership on an the salf of immovable property cannot be recognised as it inclu _ f h plaintiff. There- while the seller was not the only t, TI1 i sed fore the effect of this sale by her cannot be recognised.The Defendant appealed against this judgment on the grounds that Lawyer Agob Effendi had attended the hearing in his capacity as the Agent of the Plaintiff at the time when the latter had dis missed him. thus his participation in this case, in accordance with a special (ordinary) power of attorney, is illegal; that he (the Defendant) administered the land for a period exceeding the “ period of prescription ” provided for in the Indian Law of Limitation which was in force in Basrah, which makes the hearing of the case illegal; that he had bought the shares belonging to the Appellee from'her mother Shafiqah, her guardian; and that he administered the land prior to the date of the document of sale, and therefore the non-hearing of his personal (oral) evidence was illegal. Moreover the civil “ period of prescription ” as well passed this “ tasarruf In case the land is considered as miri land the Land Law should be applied thereto. The sale, which was made in accordance with the power of attorney, was effected with the permission of the Sharia Court. Had the sale been regarded as illegal, a judgment should have been passed to the effect that the money’ received by the Appellee through her guardian should be refunded. In view of the above the Appellor demanded that the judgment be reversed and the Plaintiff’s case rejected, and that the Appellee should pay the court fees etc. The following is the summary of the written statement in reply : The Indian Law of Limitation does not apply to this case. More over the period between the dates of its enforcement and repeal is less than the “ period of prescription ”, and the request made by the Appellor to hear his evidence regarding “ tasarruf ” and the application of the ‘‘period of prescription ” is not reasonable as he based his “ tasarruf ” on an ordinary document of sale which states that the Appellee owns these shares. This confession refutes the “ period of prescription.” As the sale of miri land effected without the permission of the Mamur of Khaqani register is con sidered illegal, the “ tasarruf ” of the Appellor is also illegal, and in this case the provisions of the Land Law cannot be applied. As the Appellor did not raise a case in the past demanding that the price should be refunded, he has no right now to claim that price. As regards the sale permission deed, it cannot now be considered as he (the Appellor) did not present it in the Court of First Instance. The independence of one of the guardians in the administration of the property of minors is invalid. In view of the above it is re quested that the judgment from which this appeal has been lodged should be approved and that the Appellor be charged to pay the court fees etc. On the date fixed for the trial, Lawyer Iskandar Mansur Effendi, Agent of the Appellor, and Lawyer Kamal Effendi A1 Sanawi, Agent of the Appellee, appeared before the Court and repeated the contents of their written statements respectively. The case having been heard the Court withdrew for discussion. As a result of the examination of the case by the Court of Appeal the important objections raised by the Appellor have been summarised as follows :— (1) That the hearing of the case was attended by Agob Effendi, as Agent of the Appellee, after withdrawing her power of attorney in his favour. (2) That under both the Civil and Indian Laws the period of prescription has lapsed in this case. The first objection is out of the question because Lawyer Agob Effendi attended the hearing in accordance with another power ot attorney which was unobjectionable. The lady who made this power of attorney in favour of her Agent did not raise any objection, and at the same time no objection to this was raised in the Court of First Instance.As regards the second objection, it appears that the administra tion of this land by the Appellor was based on the sale agreement dated 21st Muharram, 1327. After examination and taking into consideration the date on which the Indian Law of Limitation was repealed, it appears that the “ period of prescription ” did not elapse. The sanad produced falsifies the allegation made by the Appellor in respect of his “ tasarruf ” which he demanded to prove by evidence, because the Appellor was allowed possession of this land from the date of the sanad. As regards the civil c ‘ period of prescription ”, it is considered that, although a period of time has passed on the “ tasarruf ” of the Defendant (Appellor) before the case has been raised, this “ period of prescription ” is of no value as long as the Appellor has dearly admitted the ownership by the Appellee of the land under dispute. This admission is made in a sale document which states that he (the Appellor) purchased the plot of land under dispute from the guardian of the Appellee. As such sales are not recognised, and as the judgment of the Court prohibiting the Appellor from opposing the Appellee in administer ing the shares under dispute is correct, the judgment appealed is. hereby confirmed and the Appellor is ordered to pay the court fees together with 9 dinars, wages of the lawyer for one sitting, plus I.D. 11/250, wages for drafting the statement in reply. This decision is issued unanimously under Articles 196 and 198 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Article 24 of its Supplement, and declared to both parties in open Court this 9th day of May, 1932.

Kuwait.and at this stage of the political development of Iraq, the Govern ment are particularly desirous that there should not be imputations against the Law Courts and in particular against the Court of Cassation. 3. I must point out that I occupy the most peculiar position in this matter, for this report does not consist in my giving a note on the whole case only, but the honesty of the personnel of the Court of Cassation is directly challenged by the Sheikh of Kuwait and this aspect has been pressed by you upon me most forcibly, further you have put certain questions as regards the Sheikh’s position in Law. I trust I may be able to give you full and accurate information on most of these matters, but I cannot say what future decisions ought to be given by the courts because I shall D.V. most certainly be required to sit. 4. The letter from Col. Dickson dated 25th June, 1932, shows that the Sheikh of Kuwait owns five gardens or rather groups of gardens. The two gardens under reference in this matter are the Bashiya and the Fadaghiya gardens, these two gardens, with a third garden called A1 Khararn, form the group of gardens called Fadaghiyah vide para. (9) of the letter. The case already decided affects the garden Bashiya and is in respect of a claim to one-tenth of that garden being the share claimed by Raffa Bint Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair. I have received information that three of the sisters of Rafia have now filed similar cases in the Court of First Instance Basrah, cases Nos. 239, 214 and 253, and the Secretariat of the High Commissioner has been informed. The Sheikh of Kuwait alleged to Col. Dickson that a case is about to be filed in respect of the main Fadaghiyah garden, but as regards this no in formation has reached me. 5. There is a point distinguishing the facts as regards the possession of the Sheikh in the Bashiya garden and the facts re garding his possession of the Fadaghiyah garden vide page (3) of the statement of Abdul Aziz el Salim el Badar, agent for the Sheikh of Kuwait which is attached to Col. Dickson’s letter. This distinc tion is that no Tapu Sanad was ever issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait in respect of the Bashiya garden, but it appears that a Taipu Sanad was issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait in respect of the main Fadag hiyah garden vide the letter dated 14th June, 1915, from Sir Henry Dobbs* and statement on page (7) of Col. Dickson’s letter. This dis tinction must be borne in mind when I deal with the Sheikh’s possession as regards the Fadaghiyah garden. 6. I have no knowledge of the conditions under which the other four groups of gardens were bought by the Sheikh of Kuwait nor how the third garden A1 Kharam of the Fadaghiyah group was acquired. 7. Without wishing to minimise the importance of the Sheikh’s allegations, the actual case decided affects one-tenth of the small garden of 31 jerib and the Sheikh’s main fear is as regards the large garden of A1 Fadaghiyah containing 400 jeribs. 8. As to the history of the proceedings up to the date of filing the action in the Basrah Court of First Instance in respect of the Bashiya garden, I see no reason not to accept the statement of Abdul Aziz el Salim el Badar set out on pages 1 and 2 of the trans lation of his note, and I agree with the statement on page 2 of the letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf dated 11th July, 1932, that there is no doubt that it was a bona fide transac tion and that the purchase price was paid. 9. I will now summarise the case and the findings. This will enable you to follow the complicated series of facts set out in this report. * Document No. 7, p. 31.A. sues B. for a declaration of ownership in a piece of Miri land and for an injunction against B. P A. proves ownership of her ancestor. B. sets up sale dated 1327, i.e. 13th March, 1909, by ancestor of A. to ancestor of B. by means of ordinary unregistered sale deed. Held this Sanad cannot pass ownership; {a) It has not the consent of the Mamur Tapu necessary in 1327 under section 36 Land Law for Miri Land Sales. (b) The Transfer is not registered in Tapu and is there fore void vide section 1. Transfer of Possession of Immov able Property Act, 1329, and numerous decisions since Irada Saniyat, 1318. B. then sets up Limitation. (1) Under Indian Limitation Act 12 years period under article 144 and he claims possession for more than 12 years prior to Repeal of that Act by Basrah Laws Repeal Act 1920. (2) Under article 20 Land Code, 10 years is sufficient. Held by court. Under the Indian Limitation Act the period runs from date of Sanad 13.2.1909 (21st Muharran 1327) to 30.9.1920 Basrah Law Repeal Act i.e. 11 years 7J months. Further the court refused to hear witnesses that B. had possessed the land prior to date of sale because the Sanad of Sale on which he himself relies state that the seller was in possession up to date of sale. Therefore Limita tion has not run under the Indian Limitation Act. Held secondly that although article 20 Land Code gives 10 years as period of prescription yet the principle of section 1674 of the Majelleh has to be followed namely that no prescription runs if a party admits that his root of title is derived from the ancestor of the other party; in such case he cannot set up adverse possession but must establish a root of title such as a legal transfer. 10. The history of the proceedings in the Bashiya garden case has not in my opinion been accurately or sufficiently set out, I will therefore try to set out the salient facts. A great deal of stress has been laid by you and by Col. Dickson on the judgment being given by Iraqi and not British judges and I have therefore made seveia references to this aspect of the case. 11. I have had copies made of the following documents and they have been sent to your office for translation and forwarding to you :— ^ Q1 (1) Judgment Court of hirst Instance dated 15.7.

(probably 4.7.31). (13) A letter from Mr. Dobbs dated 14th June, 1915. # (14) An additional petition by the plaintiff dated 9.7.31. 12. In civil case No. 77 of 1930 of the Basrah Court of First Instance, Eafia bint Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair, sued Sheikh Ahmad Jabir A1 Sabah (Sheikh of Kuwait). She claimed that she was the owner of one share out of ten of a certain garden in Fadaghiyah. This we know is the Bashiya garden. She alleged that detendant took possession and prevented her from obtaining her share, she set out her title which was based on Sanad Khakani, that this was Miri land and any sale on such Miri land must have a special authority from Mamur of Tapu Vide section 36 of Land Law. She claimed an order to prevent interference with her enjoyment. Note : That the nearest approach to this kind of relief in England Law is for an injunction to restrain etc. The defence dated 26.10.1930 briefly denied that the Sheikh of Kuwait took the land by force and laid certain preliminary objections which were not important. On 28.1.1931 the main grounds of defence was. filed. The defendant first queried the amount of the shares shewn to be in ownership of plaintiff. No point turns on this now and it was not raised in the Court of Appeal. It merely concerns whether the plaintiff inherited one tenth or inherited 17 out of 216 shares. The third ground sets out the case for the defendant namely that his grandfather Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabah bought the shares belonging to Sbafiqa Khanim and her children Hassan, Bahija, Najiya, Rafia (the plaintiff in the case) and Kamila children of Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair for 3033 lira and 30 kurush on behalf of herself as principal and as guardian (wasi) on behalf of the children, as proved by Sanad of sale dated 21st Muharram 1327. The defendant then referred to a condition of sale that if the business of Tafweedh i.e. transfer in Tapu were delayed, that delay would not form any ground to cancel the sale, he then stated that there was a delay in registering due to political matters because the Ottoman Government considered that the Sheikh of Kuwait had bought these lands for the benefit of the British Government (sic) vide letter No. 504 dated 14.6.1915 from Abdul Aziz Effendi el Salim el Badar, agent of defendant and for this reason the Government of Turkey sent a code telegram to Dafterk- hana of Tapu Basra not to register. Note:—I have set out this ground at a length because it contains what is the real reason for the delay in registration. On 3.2.1931, plaintiff replied to this defence, the important points being the following :— (a) So far as the minor children w r ere concerned, no per mission was given by the Qadhi. Note:—I mention this because the formalities of the sale by the “ Wasi ” are given as one of the grounds in the judgment of Court of First Instance Basrah dated 30.12.1931, but this point was not pressed in the Court of Appeal, which decided the case on other points. (b) Proved that this is Miri land and the sale of Miri land without the permission of Mamur of Tapu was not allowed in 1327 under Article 36 of the Land Law. (c) That a sale outside Tapu must be registered under section 1 Law of Transfer of Possessions of Immovable Pro perty Act. The defendant made a rejoinder to this dated 12.2.31 which adds nothing to the matter but on 24.2.31 he filed a petition giving the reasons why the sale was not registered in Tapu. He said Document No. 7.that this was not done because the Turkish Government wanted a declaration that the Sheikh of Kuwait was a Turkish subiect where as he is independent under the protection of Britain On the 4th of May 1931 (probably an error for 4.7.1931) defendant put in letter fom Oalterkhana Istana to Dafterkhana Basra ordering him to do the registration on the lines of the communication from the Prime Minister. He also filed a translation of letter from Prime Minister Mahmud Shawkat Pasha to Ministry of Finance Istana ordering it to carry through the business of Sheik of Muham- mera and that of the Qaimmaqam of Kuwait if they admit that they were Turkish subjects and agree to have this endorsed in the Sanads. During the hearing on 9.7.31 the plaintiff filed an argument in writing which recapitulates the points on which he relies. 13. I have set out at length the points made by plaintiff and defendant because at the rehearing no additional pleadings were filed and the case proceeded on these original proceedings and on the arguments recorded in the “ dhabt ” i.e. record of the case. You will notice that there does not appear to be raised the matter of limitation on which you have laid so much stress but in fact in the second hearing this point was expressly raised and re corded in the “ dhabt ” and formed the main grounds of appeal taken in the second appeal. 14. At this stage I will set out the dates of the different decisions. They are : 14.4.31 claim dismissed by Mr. Hooper for lack of prosecution. This is a very ordinary step in a case and I see no reason to comment on the remarks of the defendant’s agent to the effect that at that date i.e. before judgment, Mr. Hooper was convinced of the justice of defendant’s case and for that reason plaintiff withdrew her power of attorney from her advocate and allowed the case to be dismissed for default. If Mr. Hooper really was unwise enough to shew his intentions before giving final judgment, it is quite understandable why the plaintiff dropped the case but I really have no grounds on which to say that this was the reason why the plaintiff dropped the case. There may be a dozen reasons. On 6.5.31 the plaintiff applied to continue the case by opposi tion to the judgment of dismissal. The case was heard on the 7th of July 1931 by the Vice-president and the judgment was given on 15.7.1931, in favour of the defendant i.e. of the Sheikh of Kuwait dimissing the case on the ground that an action must firstly be hied to cancel the deed of sale of the 21st Muharram before any action could be hied based on ownership claiming mana’ mu’aradha. So far as the allegation of the Sheikh of Kuwait against the bona hdes of the Iraqi judges is concerned, I cannot see that he can complain of this judgment in his favour but I now draw your attention to fact that although Mr. Hooper was known to be leaving Basrah no application was made to me as President Court of Cassation by Mohammed Effendi Wasfi, the Sheik’s ad vocate, to transfer the case to another court. If the Sheikh s agent had then any reason to suspect an intrigue either with lawyers or with Government officials I find it difficult not to suppose that he would have gone to the British Consul and information brought to me or after I went on leave to Mr. Drower who acted for me. 15. I attach copy of judgment of the Civil Court of First Instance Basrah which I paraphrase as follows: The defendant relies on a contract of sale which purports to transfer ownership to him. The plaintiff relies on inheritance through the person who made the Sanad of sale. Therefore the plaintiff cannot claim ownership until he has cancelled the sale, she must therefore first file an action to cancel the Sanad. If that succeeds, she may then claim in respect of the share of the estate which she has inherited26 as the owner and may then file an action claiming (Mana^ mua’radha) i.e. prevent the defendant from interfering with her property For the benefit of any lawyer who may be consulted I should explain that this is what the Turks call a judgment on a preliminary ground. Such judgments caused much scandalous delay and section 20 of the amended Civil Procedure Regulation was framed to curtail these judgments on preliminary points, but, unfortunately it left it to the discretion of the court and this case is an instance of the trouble which results when a judge does not give judgment on the merits as well as on preliminary objections. 16. Against this judgment an appeal was fded before the Court of Appeal C.A.148 of 1931. The plaintiff appellant: (a) challenged the correctness of the order of dismissal, (b) referred to section 36 of the Land Law and the judgment of the Court of Cassation of Constantinople dated 13.1.1331 with reference to the sale made outside Tapu by the Sanad of 21st Muharram 1327 relied on by defendant re spondent. (c) Urged that the sale of the minor’ property without leave of the Qadhi is valid. The advocate for defendant respondent maintained that the decision was correct and he also claimed that in view of the long possession of this land the Law of limitation applies. I was pre sent at the hearing of this appeal. A fairly complete note was prepared for me and I concurred with the judges. In this judgment the court held that the decision to reject the claim on the single ground that the plaintiff must first file an action to cancel the deed of sale is wrong, in particular as it will appear clear that this deed is null and void as a transfer of property being made outside Tapu vide sec. 1 Immovable Property Act and without permission of the Mamur as required under section 36 of the Land Law and as this transaction was not one merely voidable but is actually null and void, no separate action to cancel it is required before the court can treat it as being non-existent. The case was therefore remitted for re-hearing on its merits. As this decision was given by Turkish trained judges and is framed in language which pre supposes that the decision is a technical document for lawyers, the following observations will assist you in realizing what is the theory of Turkish Law regarding unregistered sale of Miri land m areas where the Tapu offices function. In Turkey there is a difference between transfer of mulk (firagh) and transfer of miri (tafweedh). In Miri lands there is always an ultimate ownership in Govt, which may be resumed and section 36 of the Land Law preserved the right of Government to interfere wdth the free disposal of such Miri land by insisting that the permission of Ma’mur concerned i.e. the Tapu Ma’mur should be obtained. Further such transfer is legally effected in the lapu OffiGc only, therefore, unless and until, a transaction affect ing Miri land was registered in Tapu and the consent obtained, usually by endorsement of the Mamur Tapu, that transaction was null and void in the year 1327 and in the eyes of the Law did not exist to pass property. The consent of the Mamur Tapu does not appear to be necessary any longer since 1329 but that does not concern the efforts to register this sale. Before going on with the proceedings I will say a word' as o why the Tapu Mamur refused to give his consent. The Law o he Ottomans is not in favour of immovable property being held y oreigners. Even in the case of Mulk land e.g. houses and small gardens it is only allowed on condition that the foreigner submitted ° e laws and courts of the country and as regards Miri land it was forbidden. The Turkish attitude in this matter throughouthas been that no sale to foreigners will be allowed and the Govern ment Mamur was forbidden to allow this transfer. Under the orders of the Turkish Prime Minister, however, they stretched a point as regards the known attitude of the Sheikhs of Muhammara and Kuwait towards the Turkish State and offered to allow them to register their sales if they admitted that they were Turkish subjects. 18. The Court of Appeal disposed of the first appeal on the 9th of November 1931 and papers went back to Basrah and on the 14th of December the Iraqi Vice-President fixed the 23rd of December for the re-hearing. Since the proceedings in this part of the case have been attacked because no British judge sat, I must point out that Mr. Lloyd was President of the Basrah Court and was in Basrah from 1st of December. All British judges know that they should sit if possible in foreigners cases and I cannot believe that any application was made to Mr. Lloyd to sit in this case and must therefore presume that the advocate Muhammed Wasfi Effendi and Abdul Aziz Effendi A1 Salim A1 Badar took no steps to draw the attention of the British President to the case. I have read the &lt;( dhabt ” and it is quite clear that the following points were raised in argument by the Sheikh of Kuwait’s advocate. (a) That in this case limitation ought to run under section 144 schedule 1 the Indian Limitation Act and that the period has elapsed. (b) If the Indian Limitation Act does not apply, limita tion runs under the Law of the country and also has elapsed. On 30th December 1931 judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff on the following grounds :— (a) That the sale as shewn by the deed of 21st Muharram 1327 was null and void under section 1 Possession of Land Law. (b) Section 1674 of the Majelle lays down that in view of the admission of the right of the plaintiff’s ancestor no prescription can be pleaded. Note :—This is the important decision as to limitation and will be discussed later on. (c) That at any event a sale by one “ Wasi ” will be invalid. 19. On this judgment appeal is made to the Court of Appeal; 2nd appeal No. 66 /932. Iskender Mansour Effendi appeared for the Sheikh as appellant. It is alleged that I was deliberately kept in ignorance of this case. Iskender Mansour is an advocate who often comes to Baghdad on appellate work and is quite well aware that he may at any time have access to the President if he wishes to apply to him. He made no effort to secure my presence in the case. The case was heard on the 9th May. There were 5 cases in the list including one concerning a foreigner on which I sat. ihe parties in the appeal by the Sheikh of Kuwait were described : Appellant: A1 Sheikh Ahmad A1 Sabah, Advocate Iskender Effendi Mansour. Respondent: Rafia bint Ali Zuhair, her advocate Kamal Effendi A1 Sinawi. ’ note that you apprehend that this omission to inform me that it vas a foreigner’s case was intentional. In view of the extremely harp nature of your conjectures I have asked the M- mi ® q 1 f* 0 pecial enquiry vide my letter to the Minister date • • ittached. I will only observe that the grounds of appeal filed by 'skender Mansour do not state that the Appellant was the Sheikh &gt;f Kuwait nor does the copy of the judgment of the First Instance iled with those grounds state that but the Sheikh is df bribed by he title of His Highness and the advocate s Power of Attorney fate that he was the Ruler of Kuwait.28 20. The judgment of the Court of Cassation sets out the grounds of appeal fully. They are as follows (a) Limitation in this case should be in accordance with para. 144 Schedule 1 of Indian Limitation Act, that the period under this is 12 years, and that 12 years of actual possession had passed before Basrah Law Repeal Act of 1920 took effect and appellant claims to prove this by proving possession before the sale deed was made. {b) If Limitation under the Indian Limitation Act is not good then the Appellant has been in possession for the necessary period under the Law of the country and section 20 of the Land Code applies which gives prescription of 10 years. (c) Appellant has enjoyed this possession by virtue of a legal sale not in opposition to the wishes of the seller. Although the sale by the one “ Wasi ” yet it was with per mission of the Qadhi and if the court cancels sale I ask for the recovery of the price. The plaintiff respondent took the points already discussed in the Law Court and in particular laid emphasis on section 1674 of the Majelle claiming that once an admission of the right of plaintiff's ancestor had been made a defence of limitation cannot succeed and he also relied on section 1 of the Transfer of Immovable Property Law. As to Limitation under the Indian Limitation Act the period runs from date of Sanad 13-2-1909 to 30th Sept. 1920 i.e. eleven years seven months and a half. The defendant appellant submitted a further statement of grounds of appeal of which the important points are :— (a) The possession exceeded 12 years under the Indian Limitation Act. {b) That the Qadhi had given valid permission. (c) That no permission of Mamur Tapu was required. The judgment of the Court of Cassation holds that:— {a) In as much as the Sanad of sale stated that possession of the seller continued up to the date of sale, the possession of the buyer for the purpose of Limitation runs from the date of the Sanad i.e. 21st Muharram 1327 and that 12 years has not expired under the Indian Limita tion Act before the Basrah Law Repeal Act. (b) Under the Law of the country the admission of a right to titled entirely prevents a subsequent setting up of Limitation under section 1674 of the Majelle. (c) The sale deed is null and void. I have examined the points of limitation under the Majelle i.e. Law of the country, and there is ample authority from the remarks of Ali Haidar the Jurist that if a defendant admits that the origin of his possession has derived from the plaintiff or his ancestor the defendant cannot plead prescription but must prove some other means of acquisition e.g. sale. In this case he tried to prove such sale but as the sale was unregistered he cannot rely on this as a transfer of property; as long ago as 1318 all such transactions outside Tapu were forbidden regarding Mulk and Miri land by Iradah Saniyah. 21. I come now to answer your specific questions:— (a) As to limitation: I have set out the view taken by the Court of Cassation and I see no reason to suppose it is wrong except that the view that possession under the Indian Limitation Act only runs from the date of the Sanad is a point on which I am a little doubtful; There is, however,much to be said for the view followed by the Court of Cassa tion that the written admission in the Sanad of sale as to possession commencing with the date of the Sanad is con clusive against the purchaser even though the Sanad itself as a disposition of property is null and void. A reference to the Sanad shews that it contains ad mission that the land is under the possession of seller up to the date of the Sanad and will be possessed by the Sheikh of Kuwait. (b) As to copy of plaint and defence: I have already stated that in the re-hearing at Basra separate written plead ings were not filed but that the “ dhabt ” a court record shews clearly that the point of limitation was argued. I have supplied copies of all the pleadings. (c) I have explained how I did not come to sit in this case. (d) See next paragraph. 22. Your question {d) presumably refers to the two gardens Bashiya and Fadaghiyah. I do not see what the Sheikh can do to contest the decision already given as regards the claims of Rafia to l/10th of the Bashiya garden, but if he wishes to apply for a review the grounds are well known vide section 27 of the Amended Civil Procedure Regulations. Clearly I cannot possibly advise to his chance of success. As regards the Fada^hiyah garden I remind you of the distinc tion between this garden and the Bashiya garden; namely, that it appears from the letter of Sir Henry Dobbs dated 14th of June 1915 that a Sanad Khakani has been issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait. If an action is filed as regards the Fadaghiyah garden the following points will certainly arise :— (a) Is the Sanad Khakani a valid disposition in Tapu ? (b) If Valid so far as the Government is concerned was it made with the consent of the seller or her heirs ? (c) If there were minors with interests in the garden when does the period of prescription cease. I will here observe that Sir Henry Dobbs’ letter shews that the entry in the register was made without the consent ox the heirs of the sellers. Under Turkish Law it is possible to file suit to declare void a transaction in Tapu and the point will be taken that it is essential that in such transactions the seller ot his agent mus e presei and admit the sale. As regards prescription for such suit I am unable to say how far prescription may run as the claimant appears to have been a minor at the time of the sale. If a minor j e fU of minority must be added to the period of prescrip ion w m informed is 15 years. In answer to your question can ® say that it is doubtful whether the Sheikh can successfully contest the claim, assuming the period of prescription is no comp e 23. As regards legislation, this depends on the genexal condi tions surrounding this case. In this matter t e raq 0 u. t j 0I1 stands in the shoes of the Turkish Governmen . e . . . v : ew con _ to foreigners holding Miri land prevails. e ^, • i p ut firmed by the courts was that this transaction 18 allow the Mamur of Tapu would, on behalf ° e . nurdhaser registration, as the sellers agreed, decDrp Umqplf to be a Turkish subject. I do not see tiiat any Johtical consideration can possibly destroy the legal results of such failure to register. . „ The Law as to limitation laid down under section 1674 of the Majelle is peculiar to English ideas but to me it seems logical.There have been many different decisions as regards necessity or non-necessity of registering land in different parts of Iraq but I am of the opinion that as far as the transactions in land at Basra is concerned section 36 of the Land Law certainly applied as to permission of Mamur Tapu and since the Irada Saniyah of 1318 tihere have been many decisions insisting that sales must be regis tered or they have no validity. The first part of section 1 of Law to dispose of Immovable Property 1329 lays this down and applies in Iraq according to many decisions. The Unregistered Sales Con firmation Proclamation 1919 affirms this in its Preamble. 24. Generally I am of the opinion that, even if the omission to inform me of the case, was intentional, the grounds given by the Court of Cassation will be accepted by the Iraq Government as being valid grounds for determining this claim and unless there is some treaty obligation I do not think that the Iraq Government will admit any liability. The argument may be expressed as follows Minor children are not bound until they reach majority. They may take any legal steps to recover what they think is their patrimony. The sale by ancestor of plaintiff is null and void. If there is a legal flaw in the title of the purchaser from their father and mother they may recover the estate even though it has enormously increased in value unless they are time barred. They were not time barred at the date of the Basrah Law Repeal Act and under the Civil Law no pres cription can be good as the Sheikh admitted he held his titles from the ancestor of Plaintiff. I will put the matter in another way. The Sheikh of Kuwait has induced the British Government to guarantee his possession of lands to which he cannot (presumably) establish his legal title. I draw attention to the following - It is in fact clear from the conditions of the deed that he was aware of the necessity of registration and aware that there were difficulties he endeavoured against the express provisions of the Law to ensure that the sale should not be considered null. 25. As to the promise by the British Government, the Iraq Government, so you inform me, don’t admit this promise to be binding on the Iraq Government. If there is a dispute between the two Governments, presumably the matter will go to the Hague Court. If the Hague Court holds that this is an international obligation of Iraq, then, the Iraq Government may have to pass a law expropriating those persons who establish their claims in those gardens. If the Hague Court holds that there is no international obli gation on the Iraq Government it seems to me that this becomes a matter between the British Government and the Sheikh of Kuwait and it is for the British Government to decide whether the Sheikh should be compensated. 26. I notice that the Sheikh of Kuwait refuses to employ Mr. Mirza Mohammed. It will be extremely difficult for the High Commissioner to get legal opinion unless some advocate of standing is employed and I am of the opinion that it is advisable to obtain the advice of an experienced local advocate. It may be that the ruling on limitation under the Indian Limitation Act can be attacked and the ruling that article 20 of the Land Code is subject to the overriding provisions of article 1674 of the Majelle may be challenged by the advocate. 27. The Political Resident of the Gulf asked about the claim to be independent of the Law Courts. All I can say is that thea i. _l oiiuiiiLi il )0 claimed There is nothing to prevent the Sheikh claiming to recover this No doubt the court did not decide this as it would mean an adiournment for payment of the court fees on the claim. 29. The court did not go into the point whether the second guardian should have joined in the sale. There may be a good deal of substance in the argument that when there are two “ Wasis ” both must join, failing which a disposition by one can be upset. 30. I cannot recommend any legislation except to alter the application of the Majelle, to possession of land under article 20 of the Land Code. 31. Finally do not let it be supposed that I am in favour of the present Civil Code known as the Majelle nor of the provisions of the Land Code. I have frequently pressed for the revision of both the Majelle and Land Code and you will find my comments in my annual reports especially for 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1931, copies of which should be in your office. Copy Letter by Sir H. Dobbs, Revenue Commissioner, Basrah, to the Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 14th June, 1915. I promised you that I would send you a written reply to the application presented by you on the 16th May, 1915, for the vegistra^ tion in the Tapu Department of the sale to the Sheikh of Koweit oi a certain Estate in Fadaghiya. The shares in the Estate weie as follows :— (1) Estate Called Bashiya. ' Shares.

There- atter you, as agent for the Sheikh of Koweit and Abdul VVahab as agent for Ahmad Pasha and Abdul Bagi and Ayesha, went before the Mudir of the Tapu to register the sale. But the Mudir of Tapu in an order dated 9 Shabat 1324 refused to register the sale owing to orders received from Constantinople, that no more sales of land in the name of the Sheikh of Koweit were to be registered. After this you and Abdul Wahab went before the British Consul at Basrah and privately registered before him a deed of sale of the Estate—in so far as the holdings of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha were concerned. Nothing was registered before the British Consul as regards the holdings of Abdul Bagi and Shafiqa and her daughters and minor son. Abdul Wahab received from you the balance of the purchase money viz. £T 38706 and handed the Estate over to the Sheikh of Koweit, in whose name it stands in the Muhasibi registers, though not in the Tapu registers. The Sheikh of Koweit has during the last few years been paying the Miri tax on the Estate to the Ottoman Government, which must be held to have by receipt of the tax, acquiesced in the transfer of the Estate to the Sheikh of Koweit. Now that Ottoman authority has been removed from Basrah and that the British Military authorities have reopened the Tapu Department the former difficulty about Tapu registration of the sale of the Estate has been removed, and you ask for formal registra tion. But in the meanwhile Ahmad Pasha ez Zuhair has died in Constantinople, but his death has of course cancelled the first power of attorney given to him by Ayesha and Abdul Bagi and the second power of attorney given by him to Abdul Wahab. Ayesha herself and the heirs of Ahmad Pasha are most of them in Constantinople, and they refused before the War to answer letters sent from Basrah asking them to appoint another agent for the completion of the sale before the Tapu Department. They have an agent in Basrah Armad ez Sani, but he holds authority only to arrange about the produce of their lands in Basrah and about the payment of taxes to Government and not for such matters as the registration of a deed of sale. The position is accordingly this. Under the Tapu Law the sale of land cannot be registered and finally validated unless the owner and the buyer appear before the Tapu Department in person or by authorised agent and testify to the fact of the sale and to the giving and receipt of the purchase money. The present owners of the shares of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha cannot now them selves appear before the Tapu and have failed to appoint an authorised agent for the purpose. Nor is there any prospect of their intentions being discovered before the end of the War. But the Tapu Department has satisfied itself by an inspection of the papers signed before the British Consul at Basrah that there was a formal sale and delivery of the shares of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha in the Estate and that the sale for those shares was paid; and in the peculiar circumstances this would justify the Tapu Department in granting a Tapu Sanad in respect of the sale of these shares. There remains the question of the shares of Abdul Bagi and Shafiqa and of her five daughters and minor son. If these persons are now prepared to appear before the Tapu in person or by authorised agent and testify to the sale of their shares, you should call upon them to do so. The whole transaction can then be com pleted and Tapu Sanads granted for the whole portion of land in question. Usual ending. (Sgd.) H. Dobbs, Revenue Commissioner, Basrah.OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN 1. In our opinion if His Majesty’s Government themselves, while in control of the Government of Iraq, had imposed the Istihlak Tax on the produce of the date gardens of either of the Sheikhs, it would have been a breach of the undertakings given in November, 1914. On this basis, we think that an obligation rests on His Majesty’s Government to compensate the Sheikhs for the imposition of the tax by the present Government of Iraq. 2. Yes. 3. We think that the test is whether the then Sheikh of Koweit was, at the date of the undertaking, de facto in possession of the portions of the gardens affected by the judgment. We are of opinion that it is not material to consider either of the two alternatives. 4. We have nothing to add. (Sgd.) T. W. H. INSKIP. (Sgd.) F. B.

From the Foreign Office telegram No.32 dated 24th torch, of which copiei are now enclosed, you will observe that H.k.G. have approved the course of action suggested in Sir Francis Humphrys f telegram No.44 anted 14th torch, and I am to reo x uest that you will take action on the lines suggested in that telegram in consultation with H.L.

But the primary interest at the moment is delay and they see no objection, if the Sheikh is prepared I take the line indicated, to the reply to the Iraq Government being of this nature. It will not be overlooked, in the same connection, that the absence of any protest by the Sheikh at this stage against the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts might well render it difficult, if not impossible, to taioe this point on his behalf should it on other grounds appear desirable to ao io, at a. later stage in the discussions. 3. a copy of this letter is being sent to the Government of India. to (Bd.)

Sir, I have the honour to refer to Captain Gastrell’s letter Eo. 122-3 of 3rd February 1933 to the Legal Secretary to his 'ajesty‘s Ambassador, Bagdad, a copy of which was forward ed to you under my printed letter Lo.l23-S of 3rd February 1933, and to add the following comments. 2. As stated in Captain Gastrell’s letter I entirely concur with His Excellency the Ambassador in welcoming any delay in the suit in question being brought into Court. In his despatch ho.43 (139/2/33} of 19th January 1933 to the Foreign Office His Excellency detailed certain courses oi actiom (l) inducing the Iraqi Government to pass special legislation deciding that the .iapu deed ol registration lor Shaikh Ahmad’s Faddaghiyeh garden granted by Sir Henry Dobbs was in all respects valid, (2j inducing the plaintiff, to settle the case out of Court, (3) a claim of immunity for the Shaikh from process in the civil courts of Iraq. It is out side my province to comment on these courses ox action s :they are ^nder consideration of His Majesty’s Government. I quite agree, of course, with His Excellency*s opinion that the political effect of the dispossession of the Shaikh would be deplorable, that it would be nothing short of a scandal if the Shaikh were dispossessed of his property after twenty-four years quiet enjoyment, and if actually dispossessed he will have a strong claim on His Majesty’s Government for compensa tion. 3. The Shaikh’s legal position in the Eaddaghiyeh, as well as in the Bashiyeh, case was dealt with at some length in my despatch Ho.824-3 of 31st October 1932, containing comments on Mr. Stafford’s letter of 24th August 1932 to Sir Francis Humphrys which e ave cover to a Hote by Mr. Alexander on both cases. The position with regard to these cases is now as follows. The Bashiyeh case has been decided against the Shaikh by the highest Court of Appeal in Iraq, but apparently he can ask for a review - vide paragraph 22 of Mr. Alexander’s Hote; while in the Faddaghiyeh case summonses have been issued by the Court of First Instance. The following is a summary of arguments in favour oi the Shaikh in these cases, some based on law, others on equity and political considerations. 3ASHIYBH . ( a ) There is no doubt that the purchase of this garden was a bona fide transaction and that the purchase price was paid. (Paragraph b of my letter of 31st October). (b) The Shaikh, unlike for his JPaddaghiyeh estate, holds no 'i'apu for the Bashiyeh garden. The reason tor tius, however, was that the Turkish u-overnment refused to register sales of land to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah unless they/-3- tiiey admitted tiiat tiiey were Turkish subjects, (Paragraph 4 of my letter of 31st October). One of the cardinal factors of our pollcy in the Gulf in pre-ifar years was opposition to Turkish claims to Kuwait, which His Majesty*s Government were continually pressing on the Shaikh, The latter could argue that his omission to produce a Tapu was due - in part - to this pressure. (c) the shaikh based his claim to the garden on prescriptive right, and under the Indian Limitation Act was only short of the necessary time ( 12 years) by 4£ months. (Paragraph h of my letter already quoted). while time limits the laid down byZ^aw must be observed, it is exceedingly hard on the Shaikh that he should lose his possession by such a short margin. (d) Moreover the Shaikh had witnesses to prove actual possession before the date mentioned in the Sanad of Sale, whom the Court refused to hear on the grounds that the Sanad of Sale on which he himself relied stated that the seller was in possession up to the date of the sale. This ruling of the Court seems to me of doubtful validity. A djs facto possession of property by a purchaser, with the permission of the former owner and seller of that property, has under certain circumstances some weight in law, and it seems to me that the Shaikh 1 s witnesses might have been heard* if they had been heard, and could have proved previous possession to the satis faction of the Court, the Shaikh would have won his case. Mr. Alexander himself is doubtful as to the ruling of the Court on tills point bexr% correct. (Paragraph 21 (a) of ilia iiote) . (e) Under the Iraq Land Act, which only prescribes 10 years* limitation, and on which the Uhaikh alternatively uased his case, he actually proved his prescriptive right. (Paragraph-4- ma 5 of same letter). Here, however, the provisions of Section 1674 of the Majelle Law were ruled to override the Land Act. I do not &amp;now what the exact wording of that Section may be, but I perceive that kr.Alexander in his comment'on this point (paragraph 9 of his Note) alludes to the 'principle 51 underlying that section. There can often be two opinions on the 'principles * 1 underlying laws. Ilr. Alexander thinks that this ruling might also be challenged. Faddaghiyeh Case . (f) Hr. Alexander takes two points in his Note, (paragraph 7 of my letter of 51st October). First - that the sale was made without the consent oi the heirs oi the sell ex s* Second - that it was essential that the seller or his agent should have been present and admitted the sale. V;ith regard to the first point. The present claimant was a minor at the time of the sale, and as such could nave no say in the transaction. To take an example. Suppossing 'A', who has a minor son 4 years old. sells property to B . it is suiel^ unreasonable to suppose that 'A' must get the consent or his son and heir before the sale is effected, or that Oie so la or 20 years afterwards can institute a clana against because at the time of the sale he (the son) was not consulted by his father. With regard to the second point. The absence of the seller or his agent at the time of the sale would appear to be breach of a minor legal technicality, since the seller -was of course well aware that the sale had been effected, and if he had any objection could have lodged it. In law, as outside it, silence is often told to give consent. ( g\ rfith reference to the remarks conUined in para • • 0-5- paragraph 2 of His nxeellency 1 s despatch on the letter written by Sir Henry Dobbs to the Agent of the Shaikh with regard to Tapu granted to the latter. It is with considerable diffidence that X offer any comments concerning a matter on which his excellency's Legal Adviser has already expressed an opinion* It is perhaps unfortunate that no proclamation was issued by the Army Commander, but from the letter itself there would , appear certain points which at the least are arguable in the Shaikh’s favour. Sir Henry Dobbs writes? 'The Shaikh of Kuwait has during the last few years been paying the Miri tax on the Estate to the Ottoman Government, which must be held to have by receipt of the tax, acquiesced in the transfer of the Estate to the Shaikh of Kuwait. tt This would seem to be a strong argument in favour of the Shaikh. Later in his letter Sir Henry Dobbs sayss 'The position is accordingly this. Under the Tapu Law the sale of land cannot be registered and finally validated^ unless the owner and the buyer appear before the Tapu Department in person or by authorised agent and testily to the fact of the sale and to the giving and receipt oi the purchases money. The present owners of the snares of i-dimad Pasha and Ayesha cannot now themselves appear befoi e the Ictpu and have failed to appoint an authorised agent for the purpose. Hor is tilere any prospect of tneir intentions being discovered before tne end of tfie v/ar.

But if, as it seems, Sir Henry’s act was ultra vires at the time, it remains ultra vires, since nothing has been done to remove the taint and the court would be bound to upset the registration. The wording of the last sentence of Article 115 of the Constitution quoted by Mr, Hall is certainly wide, but to what acts do they refer? The following: (a) the suppression ox hostilities; (b) the establishment and consolidation of order and public security; (c) the carrying out of orders issued in accoruance with martial law between 5th Uovember, 1914 and ^ the date of the coming into xorce of the oOns bituuion Could the above properly cover the establishment of a /privateS.oS. private proprietary title?

I have now received his views which are briefly to the following effect. The fact that there is a consideration of principle which renders it particularly desirable that His Majesty s representatives snould not consent to act as agents for the service of legal documents would no doubt have been a good ground for the return of the documents to Judicial Authorities in Iraq. But it appears that the documents have already been sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and in these circumstances it would seem that the Iraq Authorities are entitled to assume that the Ambassador has made himself responsible for securing delivery of the documents. It is inferred from the terms of the Foreign Office letter that the Ambassador was requested to undertake this task as a matter of international comity and not in pursuance of any Convention or Treaty.

In the observations of Sir Francis Humphrys in the last paragraph of his despatch dated 19th January, it is said that the Iraq procedure is elastic enough to provide for other forms of substituted service. Would it not be very unfortunate if an application were made to the Iraq Court for an order for substituted service based on failure or delay on the part of the Political Resident to deliver documents in accordance with the request made by the Iraq Authori ties? I am as yet unfamiliar with the intricacies o this question and for that reason alone I should hesitate to pronounce any very decided opinion in face of the combined views of the Foreign Office and the India Office. Moreover I see the great political difficulty Oj any action which appears to make His Majesty’s representative the agent of Iraq as against the Sheikh. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the Solicitor appear to me to have considerable force and you will no doubt wish to take them into consideration before a final aecision tanen.

British Embassy, Bagdad. 19th January 1933 0 Sir, With reference to your despatch H'o P 672 of December 2nd, 1932, regarding the situation which has arisen in regard to the legal title of the Shaikh of Kuwait's properties ^n 'Iraq, I have the honour to report that a law suit in respect of the Shaikh's Eaddaghiyah Estate was filed in the Basrah Court on the 20th October, 1932, and this Embassy has now received certain legal documents from the 'Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request that they be forwarded to Kuwait for service on the Shaikh* These documents include a statement of claim made on behalf of the plaintiff, Abdullah ibn Isa Pasha al Zuhair. Erom this it appears that the plaintiff claims by inheritance from his aunt, Ayesha, a third part of the whole plot known as the Eaddaghiyah date garden, on the grounds that there never was a legal conveyance of the land to the ohaxkh of Kuwait* He declares that the Tapu deed of registration granted to the Shaikh by Sir Henry Dobbs in 1915 was granted illegally, and that it is, therefore, voidable and should be set aside* 2 ^ I am advised both by my Legal Secretary and the Judicial Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, that, if the suit goes forward to judgment, there is a grave danger that the Shaikh will lose the action. From the report made by Mr. Alexander, the President of the Court of Appeal, last summer when he was acting as Judicial Adviser, it would also seem that he is of the same opinion, since he states « I can therefore say that it is doubtful whether the Shaikh can successfully contest the claim.' 1/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I*&gt; K.C.V.O., etc* etc* etc*-2~ I will not trouble you here with the complicated legal arguments by which this claim might be promoted or rebutted, but I think it relevant to enclose x or your perusal a copy of* a letter sent to the Agent of the Shaikh by Mr. (now Sir Henry)Dobbs in his capacity as Revenue Commissioner at Basrah in June, 1915. Prom the terms of this letter it would seem the requirements of the Tapu Law were recognised but that in the peculiar circumstances then obtaining it was decided to ignore them* Had the registration subsequently been validated by a proclamation by the Army Commander, I am advised, all would have been well, but without legislative cover, it seems difficult to resist the contention of the plaintiff that the Tapu deed of registration granted to the Shaikh in 1915 was void ab initio* 3 , The actual wording of the undertaking given to the Shaikh in Colonel Knox's letter dated the 3rd November, 1914, was as follows: »that your gardens which are now in your possession,viz. the date gardens situate between Pao and c^urnah shall remain in your possession and in possession of your ^ ^ descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes*' It will be noted that the wording used is wide enough to cover gardens In the possession of the Shaikh even if not in his legal possession, and whether this undertaking legally binds His Majesty's Government to recompense the Shaikh tor thv j.3ss cf garden under the present circumstances or - , • - -tain that he will look to His Majesty's Government for compensation, if in fact they cannot prevent him losing possession. In such an event his moral claim will be a strong one. I have, therefore, given the matter taas* my most anxious and careful thought as to , t should be justified in taking with the what action, if any, I should jub . ^qvinikH's interests* 'Iraqi Government to protect 4* e 9 * +6* O • • % 4 * I am advised that the hnly certain means to prevent an adverse judgment being given against the Shaikh would be to induce the * Iraqi Government to pass legislation declaring that the Tapu deed of registration granted by Sir Henry Dobbs was in all respects valid. Apart from the difficulty of persuading the ’Iraqi Government to put such a measure to Parliament, there are obvious disadvantages in associating His Majesty’s Government with such a representation. The request would, in effect, be a request that the Iraqi Government should step in and destroy by law a private right for the advantage .of one party in a pending suit a On the other hand, it can be argued that, apart from legal technicalities, a bona fide sale did take place, and that it would be nothing short of a scandal if the Shaikh should be dispossessed of his property after twenty-four years quiet enjoyment, I should, of course, stress this aspect of the matter with the ’Iraqi Government in any representations I might make, butthe disadvantages which I have outlined appear to me to be 30 weighty that I feel that I should not be justified m asking the 'Iraqi Government to pass the necessary legislation except on explicit instructions from His Majesty's Government, a. I have considered also whether any attempt could be made either by the Shaikh or the 'Iraqi Government to induce the laintiff to settle this action out of court. It seems tnat he plaintiff is without means, since in his statement of claim ,e has applied for a postponement of payment of the court fees ^ T+ Dossible- therefore that he would intil after judgments -t io P°—^ • ’ of-fer* I do not, however, view such ie open to an attffactive oi-e , solution with favour, as it would encourage other claimants ;o initiate suits. From information before me, * t0 i i being instigated and supported relieve that the plaintiff is Dein * * _ lawyers, who would be likely to hold Dy a group of speculative i.av^eia, +- vo-t-Ai rmblAnother disadvantage Dut for the maximum amount obtaxnaoiec ^ , vv , Qnf1 the ’Iraqi Government would 3 f this course is that the Shaxkh and the ..q . , +„ H i a Walestv's Government to foot the ilmost certainly look to His Majes^ bill.-&amp;&amp;■ There remRine the question whether the Shaikh could in law claim immunity from process in the civil courts in 'Iraq* On this sovereigns from the jurisdiction of the 'Iraqi courts, and, although, until a test case is heard, it is not -possible to give a definite opinion, it is considered almost certain that the courts would maintain a right to jurisdicticn in all cases concerning title to immovable property situated in 'Iraq, Moreover, it should not be overlooked that the Shaikh submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the 'Iraqi courts in the suit brought against his Bashiyah estate* course, His Majesty's Government are prepared to instruct me to at all palatable to the 'Iraqi Government would be to undertake that, in return for such action, His Majesty's Government will abstain from inviting them to contribute to the sum that may be paxd. eventually to the Shaikh as compensation for the imposition of the Ubtilaz tax. Even so I am advised that it would be almost impossible to obtain the consent of Parliament to such a measure I fully recognise that the political effect of the dispossession of the Shaikh would be deplorable, and that it is most desirable I am advised that 'Iraqi law contains no provision excluding foreign 7 If, after considering the grave objections to such a request the 'Iraqi Government to validate the Tapu deed by legisla tion, I feel that the only way in which I could make the proposition as a matter of courtesy to the ruler of a neighbouring State, that the 'Iraqi Government should arrange that his property rights in 'Iraq should be rendered unassailable* I confess, however, that the * Iraqi Gov 'Iraq should be rendered unassailable* I confess, however, that short of monetary compensation, I am unable to see any practical unable to see any practical means of disposing of this unfortunate case As regards the disposal of the judicial documents now in I propose to send them on Gulf, together with a copy of this despatch. I at this stage as to vise the ikh should be encouraged to accept or dissuaded from/from accepting service.. Refusal of service will certainly delay matters, but cannot indefinitely defer judgment, since f Ira&lt; 2 .i procedure is elastic enough to provide for other forms of substituted service. Since, however, it will be infinitely more difficult to obtain any redress once an adverse judgment is in being, I should welcome any methods resulting in delay. At- the same time, I am inclined to the view that, although full ccnsidera** tion is being given by Hie Majesty’s Government *to his delicate position in the matter of the impending action, it would be advisable for the Shaikh himself to take the best possible legal advice that he can obtain as to how he can best defend his own rights.

Ahmad Pasha was at that time tantinople and he received from the Shaikh of Kuwait before starting a hawala on Bomtoy for £T 10,000 in part payment. He left a power of attorney with Andul Wahab Pasha Kartas, empowering/empowering him on bahalf of himself and Abdul Bagi and Ayesha to complete the transaction of the sale by Tapu registration and thereon to receive the balance of the purchase moneys Thereafter you, as agent for the Shaikh of Kuwait and Ahdul Wahab as agent for Ahmad Pasha and Abdnl Bagi and Ayesha, went before the Mudir of the Tapu to register the sale* But the Mudir of Tapu in an order dated 9 Shahat 1324 refused to register the sale owing to orders received from Constantinople, that no more sales of land in the name of the Shaikh of Kuwait were to be registered. After this you and Abdul Wahab went before the British Consulatf^asrah and privately registered before him a deed of sale of the Estate - ! r ! i n so far as the holdings of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha were con- cerned. Nothing was registered before the British Consul as regards the holdings of Abdul Bagi and Shafiqa and her daughters and minor son. Abdul Wahab received from you the balance of the purchase money viz. £T 38706 and handed the Estate over to the Shaikh of Kuwait, in whose name it stands in the Muhasibi registers, though not in the Tapu registers* Kuwait has during the last few years been paying the Min tax on the Estate to the Ottoman Government, which must be held to have by receipt of thejtax, acquiesced in the transfer of the Estate to the Shaikh of Kuwait» How that ids* Ottoman authority has beer, removed frons.Basrah a that the British Military authorities have reopened the ^apu Dept* the former difficulty about Tap* registration of the sale vmi ask for formal registra- of the Estate has been removea, and y , ., ,H Pasha ez Zuhair has died in tier..

I find that the ♦Iraqi Government have ordered that export duty shall be taken on all taxable exports from ♦Iraq by the Shaikh of Kuwait. Immunity from these dues has been conceded in the past to garden produce exported from ♦Iraq for the personal use of the Shaikh, but, as it is not covered by any law or agreement, it is not possible, now that the istihl&amp;k tax is being enforced throughout the country, for the Government to continue to allow exemption for these exports. This produce is, therefore, brought into the same category as that of the remainder of the produce exported from the Shaikh's gardens in ’Iraq. 2. In view of the fact that the 'Iraqi Government have given no official reply to a request made by the High Commission, and subsequently by His Majesty’s Legation, that the produce of the gardens of the Shaikh should be exempted from the istihlak tax until the whole question had been settled, I do not anticipate that any good result would be achieved by an official protest on this smaller matter, certainly not until some progress has been made towards reaching a settlement of the problem* _ 3 . I take this opportunity to forward a copy of my despatch Mo.29 of January 12th 1933, to the Foreign Office in/ e Honourable ^ ~ The Political Hesident in the Persian Gui*, B u s h i r e.in which I put forward suggestions as to the lines on which an attempt should be made to estimate the amount which the Shaikh is out of pocket as the result of the imposition of the istihiak tax, as a basis for the assessment of compensation should it be decided that His Majesty t s Government will pay compensation• I have the honour t o be. Sir, Your obedient servant, sd/~ F •H, Humphry s#copy * ncu 29 . Britisii Embassy, Baghdad s 12 tJa January 1933* Sir I have the honour to address you on the subject of the revenue exemption of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and the dis cussion at the inter-departmental meeting held at the Colonial Office on September 13th, 1932, which took place regarding the undertaking given to him* 2. It is shown in the minutes of that conference that it was generally agreed that steps should be taken to secure the payment to the Shaikh of some kind of financial compensation in liquidation of the obligations arising out of the undertaking given to him in 1914, and that it would be necessary to form some estimate of the extent to which he would be out of pocket as the result of the imposition of the istihlak tax* I promised, after giving the question further consideration on my return to Baghdad, to advise as to how this could best be done* 3 * I have reached the conclusion that it is not possible to compile an accurate estimate of the financial effect cf the istihlak taxation upon the Shaikh of Kuwait, except by calling upon him to provide substantiated figures of crop sales and exports. Bo estimate will be of real value unless it is based upon actuals and the fact that the Shaikh is now paying, or bearing the burden of, the tax, provides an opportunity for an approximate assessment of his losses# 4. The collection of istihlak tax on the produce of his gardens in ’Iraq can only affect his pocket detrimentally in three/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G*C#S#I# &gt;K*C#V*0* f etc*, etc.,three ways, viz;- (a) by the direct imposition of a 10 ^» tax upon the value of all produce exported from ’Iraq, whether for his own use or for sale; 1 to) by the collection of the tax upon all produce from his gardens placed on the market in ’Iraq; and (c) toy the recent decision of the ’Iraqi Government to take customs duty upon garden produce exported by the Shaikh from ’Iraq for his own personal use, these exports having been passed duty free until a short while ago® She cash value of this exemption is small® 5® For purposes of calculation, (a) and (c) can be grouped together® All payments of istihlak tax upon exported produce of the gardens must have been Blade by the owner of the produce, i.e* the Shaikh, or his agents. Receipts for such payments should be available, and state ments regarding export can be checked® It should, therefor be a simple matter for the Shaikh to prepare at the end of one year from the date of application of the new system of taxation to dates, i.e®on 1st August,1933, a comprehensive statement, which can be easily substantiated, of the whole of his payments on this account. Care would be needed in checking to ensure that no exports of produce from pro perties not covered by the exemption were included, but if the Shaikh or his agent had purchased such produce and subsequently exported it istihlak tax would have been payable at the time of sale and not at the time of export® ^b) is more difficult, as under the law the tax would generally be paid by the purchaser, or by the owner of the licensed store into which the produce is placed preparatory . • • • •544 3- preparatory to being marketed* The Shaikh or his agents would not, therefore, necessarily pay the tax, and might have no receipts to produce* The effect of the tax on the Shaikh is indirect by reason of his receiving a lower price for the produce than he would have received had there been no taxation* It should not, however, be beyond the resources of the Shaikh to provide a statement of dates and grain grown upon his estates and sold in ’Iraq by his agents* his agents doubtless keep some tally showing how the crops are disposed of, and it would probably be possible to verify, by reference to the ’Iraqi Government tax records, the transactions which the Shaikh claims have involved him in loss* The statement should cover the same calendar year as is suggested for the figures of export* The rate of tax is computed according to a fixed official conversion rate, and no difficult questions of valuation of produce need be encountered* ^ Given the above information, there should be little v difficudty in assessing, in September next, with a degree of accuracy, the Extent of the loss which the Shaikh has suftered, and will be likely to suffer in the future, by the imposition of the istihl&amp;k tax* 6 .

Sir John Simon is of opinion that, until the advice of the Law Officers, which is about to be sought on the whole question, has been received and considered, no final decision can be reached as to the course of action to be pursued by His Majesty’s Government in this matter; but it appears to him Important that in the meantime every endeavour should he made to delay this suit against the Sheikh of Koweit going forward to judgment, and he recommends that, with this object, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be instructed to withhold service of the judicial documents emanating from the Iraqi Court. 3. Apart from the fact that such action would seem to be called for on general grounds of expediency, there is a consideration of principle which renders it particularly desirable that His Majesty* s Representatives should not consent e Unde r-bec ret ary of state, India Office.

His Majesty's Government have throughout contended that the Iraqi Government are under definite obligation themselves to honour the undertakings given to the Sheikhs of Koueit and Mohammerah in 1914, and it may still be necessary to test the validity of this contention before the Permanent Court of International Justice. For example, if the Law Officers advise that His Majesty^ Government are legally liable to preserve the immunity of the Sheikhs both from taxation and from dispossession of their property, His Majesty* s Government might well consider it advisable to adopt the course of action which was contemplated in 1930 and to claim their right to refer to the Permanent Court the question whether this obligation is one which has also become binding internationally on Iraq. So long as this possibility exists, it is important that no action should be taken by His Majesty 1 s Government or their Representatives which could be construed as being inconsistent with their view that the responsibility for implementing the pledges given to the Sheikhs in 1914 rests with the Government of Iraq. Sir John Simon is advised that the execution of service of the documents emanating from the Basra Court by the Political Resident might/if carried out without any official protest by His Majesty's Government, prejudice the case of His Majesty’s Government in this manner and, subject to the views of Sir Samuel Hoare and of the Treasury, who are also being consulted, he would suggest that the Political Resident be instructed to defer service of these documents pendingi&amp;at mmmr v Mu km was ♦ It womM also mmm %mt Oo ia of %h* m.jm opinion* mimm km states f ■ i, aan t bars fora aay tkm.% it is doubtful mmt'mr turn iSim.ikh mn mmmmfullg oontaat %bm mlrnim*.

It is shown in the minutes of that conference that it was generally agreed that steps should be taken to secure the payment to the Shaikh of some kind of financial compensation in liquidation of the oblig ations arising out of the undertaking given to him in 1914, and that it would be necessary to form some estimate of the extent to which he would be out of pooiet as the result of the imposition of the istihlak tax. I promised, after giving the question further consideration on my return to Bagdad, to advise as to how this could best be done. s. I have reached the conclusion that it is not possible to compile an accurate estimate of the financial effect of the istihlak taxation upon the Shaikh of Kuwait, except hy eallint: upon hi-i to p substantiated figures of crop sales and exports. Mo estimate will be of real value unless it is based upon actuals and the fact that the Shaikh is now paying, or bearing the burden of, the tax, provides an opportunityfor an approximate assessment of his losses. 4. The collection of istihlak tax on the produce of his gardens in T Ir&amp;q. can only affect his pocket detriment ally in three ways, viz;- (a) hy the direct imposition of a 1Q$ tax upon the value of all produce exported from ^raq, whether for his own use or for sale; Cb) hy the collection of the tax upon all produce from his gardens placed on the market in T lraq; and (c) hy the recent decision of the ’Iraqi Grovernment to take customs duty upon garden produce exported hy the Shaikh from ’Iraq for his own personal use, these exports having been passed duty free until a short while ago. The cash value of this exemption is small. 5 . ]?or purposes of calculation, (a) and (c) can he grouped together. All payments of istihlak tax upon exported produce of the gardens must have been made by the owner of the produce, i.e. the ahaikh, or his agents. Beceipts for such payments should be available, and statements regarding export can be cheeked. It should, therefore , be a simple matter for the Shaikh to prepare at the end of one year from the date of application of the new system of taxation to dates, i.e- on ls ' b ^ t 1933, a comprehensive statement, which can be easily substantiated, of the whole of his payments on this account. Care would be needed in checking to ensure that no exports of produce from properties not covered hy'by the exemption were included* but if the Shaikh or his agent had purchased such produce and subsequently exported it istihlak tax would have been payable at the time of sale and not at the time of export. (b) is more difficult, as under the law the tax would generally be paid by the purchaser, or by the owner of the licensed store into which the produce is placed preparatory to being marketed. The Shaikh or his agents would not, therefore, necessarily pay the tax, and might have no receipts to produce. The effect of the tax on the Shaikh is indirect by reason of his receiving a lower price for the produce than he would have received had there been no taxation. It should not, however, be beyond the resources of the Shaikh to provide a statement of dates and grain grown upon his estates and sold in ^raq by his agents. His agents doubtless keep some tally showing how the crops are disposed of, and it would prohahly he possible to verify, by reference to the 'Iraqi Government tax records, the transactions which the Shaikh claims have involved him in loss. The statement should cover the same calendar year as is suggested for the figures of export. The rate of tax is computed according to a fixed official conversion rate, and no difficult questions of valuation of produce need be encountered. Given the above information, there should be o=Hp«!&lt; 3 in 2 in September next, with a little difficulty in assessing, i v „. g «. of oooofo,. tM 10 ' ' hl01 tla „„ ^ i “ *“ futaro, W imposition of t„. istmi ton.9 6. The Hon 1 hie the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, in his despatch ho.34 of 1932 r dated the 16th of August, 1932, paragraph 6, offered to try and obtain what ever details are required for this purpose from the Shaikh. I recommend that the Shaikh should he asked to provide these particulars. I can think of no other simple method of obtaining them. 7. I understand that the question as to whether the payment of compensation to the Shaikh is a legal obligation which rests on His Majesty 1 s Government has been referred for opinion to the Law Officers of the Grown, and that if it is held that no legal obligation exists a lump sum payment will be made to the Shaikh ex gratia to be shared if possible between the Treasury and the Government of India. Such a payment would finally dispose of his claim. Whichever solution is finally adopted it will ■be necessary to form a preliminary estimate of the Shaikh's losses due to the imposition of the new tax. In the meantime the instructions to the political Resident can no doubt be framed in such a way as to avoid committing His Majesty's Government to shouldering any responsibility in the matter. 8. The above remarks apply in general to the exemption accorded to the similar case of the ohaikh of Mohammerah, although no objection has been raised by him on his behalf against the effect of the istihlak tax , n his revenue exemption. If it is decided, in .nciple, to grant compensation, the amount to be given him could be assessed on the lines suggested above.

It is unfortunate, hut as you know true, that we have been accused of breach of faith, where the Shaikh of Mohaiamerah was concerned, and I think our good name and prestige should not be asked to stand another such ' Shock” , where Kuwait is concern- ed. 6. The Shaikh’s cousin Abdullah as- Salim yesterday mad© the rather unpleasant but somewhat apt remark to me apropos of the recent annulment by the Persian Govern ment of the B’Aroy Concession# 'If you do not play square with your friends, you must not expect sympathy ix your enemies break agreements'. This I mention in passing as an example of what people are thinking of here. ^ It is of interest to note that the Iraq CJovernuBnt has proceeded quite methodically in the matter of the taxation of the Shaikh’s gardens, (a) 'Ashur' tax was taken on the 'Shitwi' (or winter crop)of the gardens in the Spring of 1932. (b)'Ashur'tax was taken on the 'Saifi' (or summer crop) in the summer of 1932. (o) They have now (Autumn 1932) demanded customs export tax on garden produce (fruit, wood, lucern- grass, dates, palm fronds, etc.,) destined for the Shaikh’s own household in Kuwait, such produce being exempt from taxation by law, to property owners residing in Iraq. 8&gt; in connection with 7 (o) above I would draw your attention to my confidential B.O.letter 1*0.194 dated the 88th October 1938 to H.A.Cooper, Bsquire, the Director of Customs and Kxeise, Basrah, copy of which was sent to you, inTrfmfllaUon of a From - His Excellency 3&amp;aikh Six' al-Jalir as-JubeOi, K«C 9 C.S.I. $ Huler of Kuwait.

As Mr* Alexander points cut (paragraph 5 of his note,* there is a dlatinguiofcing point between the oa»e of the Baehiyeh garden and that of the Feddaghiyeb garden* in the former no apu Sanad was ever issued to the tihaiish of ?.uwait ., in 'i-e lat-or a Taya Jamd wae ieeued. *i» reason for the not applying for the Sanad in the ease of the Baehiyeh garden is g-ven in paragraph 12 of Sir. Alexander' e note, in which he states* he defendent then referred to a eonditioa of eale that if the ousineei of fafweedh, i.e., tranefw in tapu were delayed, that delay would not form any ground to cancel the eale, he then stated that there was a delay in registering due to political oatters because * * *because tile Ottoman Ooverment consider$4 that the ohaikh ©f Kuwait had bought these lands for the benefit of the British Government (sic) vide letter Ko.504 dated 14th dune 15115 from Abdul A*i* Mfendi el .ialim el Badar, agent of defendant and for this reason the Government of Turkey sent a code telegram to Oafterkhana of Tapu Basrah not to roister.” •On the 12th February 1931 the defendant a rejoinder which adds nothing to the matter* but on 24th February 1931 he filed a petition giving the reasons why the sale was not registered in fsvpu. He said that this was not done because the Turkish Government wanted a declaration that the Shaikh of Kuwait was a Turkish subject whereas he is independent under the protection of Britain* 1 • Further* in paragraph IT of hi® note* Mr* Alexander states! w Before going on with the proceedings I will say a word as to wby the Tapu Mamur refused to give his consent* The lew of the Ottomans is not in favour of immovable property being held by foreigners* Eves in the case of Mulk lasd,e»g* houses and wsall ««rd«Ji» it iu only allowad on condition tl»t tiie forai*sner submitted to tius lawe anu court* of the country and as regards Kiri land it ma.a forbidden. Xhe Turkish attitude in this natter throutjheut hae been that no sale to foreigners will be allowed and the OoTernment Gamur was forbidden to aU.w this transfer. Under the orders of the Turkish Prime Minister, however, they stretched a point as regards the known attitude of the Shaikhs of Muhamerah and Kuwait towards the Turkish State and offered to allow th*« to register their sale if they admitted that they were I'urkish &gt; subjects**#* * * .’here are of course certain points in favour of the Jhaikh, though the* have beau overruled in the Courts. One is that in the case of the Baehiyeh garden, as Mr. Alexander points out {paragraph 8), there ia no doubt that Its purchase by the Shaikh was a bona fide transaction and that the purchase price wrs paid. The grounds on which the Shaikh seeks to rebut the claim of the plaintiff ares 11) Undai* the Indian limitation Act# # (2) tinder /rticia 20 Of this Acte * Paragraph 9 of Mr* Alexanaer v s note* Under the former the Shaikh, fey the decision of the Court, is only 4Jr months short of the necessary time (12 ye- rs) * The Court refused to mar witnesses that the Shaikh land possessed the land prior to the date of its sale, on the grounds that the ssaad of Sale on which he himself relied stated that the seller was in possession up to the date of the sale* fresum* ably the Shaikh can produce witnessed to prove actual possess ion before the date mentioned in the ianad of sale, and ft* Alexander (paragraph 21 (a) ) is doubtful a© to whether possess Ion under the Indian -Limitation Act only v ujis a.i. cm the date of the Bsnsd* He is of opinion {paragraph 2d } that both that ruling, and the ruling that Article 20 of the -mad Code is subject to the overriding provisions ox t'tm M&amp;jolle Law, might be challenged. ££jm fefelJ. it wouia t&amp; m that both these rulings might well be challenged* mm re ard to there feeing no British judge on the know that they should sit if possible in foreigners' cases tribunals which tried the case, Mr. Alemnuer oaye* * * aiU * t point out thiit Hr* Lloyd was President of the Basrah - art and was in B&amp;srsto from 1 st of mcemfeor. 3rltisA ' uci ^ s* #un4.

The lady sold the property on her own behalf and on behalf of her 5 dau^iters, she being the sole executrix under documents issued by the Basrah Sharia Court dated End Muharram 13E4 and End Muharram 1327 respectively. ^ Complete sale deeds were drawn up and witnessed ty S7 of the leadins notables (ashraf) of Basrah including the Sbaifch cf Mohammerah, itoe Naqib af Basrah, Seyed Talib Pasha and six of the leading members of Ihe Al Zuhair family, fhese documents are still preserved. 5 No Tapu documents were taken out at the time, because as in the case of Ife.

By Turkish Law, a purchaser of property was bound to take out fresh Tapu papers, otherwise the sale could be declared null and void* This law was never properly enforced* 7* As in 1he case of the main Fadd.aghiyeh property (which was purchased at the same time) His Majesty’* Government also at the ttime instructed Shaikh Mubarak to have the title deeds registered in the British Consulate adding that, they His Majesty’s Gkwerament would protect the property from an encroachment* 8. Unfortunately this last was not done, because of the difficulty of persuading a lady of Shafiqah’S standing to visit the British Consul and bear witness to the sale • 9 # During the early days of British occupation to be exact on 16th May 1915, a good opportunity presented itself of having the original sale deeds, substituted for proper Tapu documents, and application was accordingly made to Mr* (later Sir Henry Dobbs) Dobbs, Hevenue Commissioner, Basrah to this end* The 14th June 1915 was fixed for performing the transfer transaction, but Mr*Dobbs was unable to put the matter through because Shafiqah, had in the meantime fallen seriously ill* Shortly afterwards Shafiqah after losing her two small sons Hassan and Abdul Baqi, died, and the matter of the Tapu papers remained In abeyance, an occurr ence not considered dangerous at the time, partly because the garden was a very small one, and partly because every- ^ 4 .V, *=» i *! •f p as would win th© war, end Iraq one anticipated that th© allies waa±a wx .

He held a power of attorney from his wife at the time the sale was effected, and he promised that such powers of attorney should be forwarded to Abdul Wahab Pasha al Qirlas, to enable the latter to appear before the Tapu Department, and declare the ^ validity of the sale as was required by Law. Subsequently a power of attorney was sent but this, it is today said, was not the one signedsigned by Aislia* It was made out by Ahmad Pasha as Zuhair who stated that he had executed it by virtue of a power of attorney which he held frcm his wife (Aisha) and which was attested by the Notary Public at Galata (Constantinople). 3 * Althou^i Shaikh Mubarak had bought sundry other properties without tie Turks raising objection, in the case of Fa&amp;daghiyeh, they the Turks at the last moment, and after the money had passed hands refused to allow Shaikh Mubarak to take out Tapu papers or allow him to take possession, unless he registered himself as a Turkish national. Apparently the Turks angry with Shaikh Mubarak for having entered into relations with His Majesty’s Govern ment adopted this course out at revenge pure and simple. A regular 'Cause Celebre ? ' resulted. Shaikh Mubarak appealed to His Majesty’s Government through me Political Resident, Persiai Gulf in two letters written on 26th Jamad Auwal 1528 and 61h Rajah 1328 (13th July 1910) and the latter with the authority of His Majesty's Govern- 1 meat instructed the Shaikh not to taka out Turkish national ity papers^ to have the sale deeds secretly registered in the British Consulate, Basrah. This was done, Shaikh Mubarak taking the precaution to get the principal natables of Basrah to witness the sale deeds. The British Consul who carried met through the transaction was Mr.Crow, g On I6tb May 1915 application was made by the Shaikh of Kuwait’s Agent to Mr.Bobbs, Bevenue Commissioner, Basrah (later Sir Henry Dobbs, Hi^ Comission- er for Iraq) for the 'Faddaghiyeh' to be registered on the Tapu Department. Mr.Dobbs after enquiring into the case ordered on Hth June 1915 that Tapu papers be issued and the property registered in the name of the Shaikh.

(b) That the sale was illegal since Aisha 1 s husband Ahmad Pasha as Zuhair who visited Kuwait and carried through the sale, had no power of attorney from, his wife, at the time the sale was effected.

This decision was given on 13th Huly 1931, On 9th Hovembsr 1931 an appeal was made to Baghdad. Here the appeal was upheld and the case was sent for reexamination. 17. On 20th December 1931 the appellate Court passed a final decree against the Shaikh of Kuwait and ordered him to pay all costs in the retrial. The Court however gave the Shaikh the option of filing a suit against the heirs of Shafiqah, to recover the original sum paid for her share of the property by Shaikh Mubarak, according to articles 1674 and 1732 of the Majella, and article 1 of the Law of Possession of immoveable property. 18.

Young has now sent to Humphrys (who has passed them on to us) translations of the documents mentioned in paragraph 11 of Alexander’s note which was enclosed in Stafford’s letter. These translations are very voluminous and I do not propose to distribute the whole mass around the interested departments unless you feel strongly that you should have a copy, in which ease I will of course arrange to let you have one. Alexander, in his note of the 20th of August, appeared to take the view that, after theplea of prescription under the local law of limita- :T ^ ^ tions had been disallowed, the deed of sale upon which the Shaikh based his title was declared invalid primarily because the sale was not registered in Tapu, and that the fact that the deed of sale had been executed by one guardian only when it should have been executed by both of two joint guardians d was only considered as a secondary and relatively I * unimportant ground for invalidating the deed of sale. This was the impression which I gained -'to,; f r om Alexanders note, and I think Stafford must have gained the same impression since he wrote in his letter to Humphrys, TT The Shaikh T s difficulties ft #5 ' arise solely from the fact that as he was not an Ottoman subject, he could not obtain a clear title to these lands.'' I have read the new documents now available, and I must confess that I find them very difficult to follow and to interpret. Consequently such observations as I venture to make upon them are very tentative. $1 TO ^z.ib'tovQB vcf ^ lacjptq to eiBha * xe(:t 1(5 ^ iU vO 1 Blltlt'JJi bOB to WVX .!’• TB i tai * *3 qoio :}XCiii to HO 1 no C r:aC-t to •' ^10 my mind the documents now available throw a different weight upon the twoarguments, viz. , (a) that sale was never registered in Tapu, and (b) that sale was by one guardian only, and mahe it appear that the latter argument is relatively the more important. You can judge for yourself from two of the documents, of which I enclose copies, namely items 3 and 4 in the list in paragraph 11 of Alexander 1 ^ memorandum. if the case against the Shaikh is really in large measure based upon the non-participation in the sale by one of the joint guardians, then I imagine that we must modify Stafford’s statement that n The Shaikh’s difficulties arise solely from the fact that as he was not an Ottoman subject, he could not obtain a clear title to these lands.” I am sending similar letters to Baxter and Trickett and copies to Humphrys and Young. Yours sincerely,'h*' n n o* 1931, by the Court of First Instance, Basrah. 9 Plaintiff: Hafi f ah Khartum daughter of ! Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair. Represented by her Lawyer Agob Kffendl. Defendant: Shaikh Ahmad A1 Jabir Al Sabah. Represented by his Lawyer Muhammad Wasfi :ffendi. The Court of First Instance, Basrah, formed of 1 Abdul Hamid Al Mulla Ahmad, Single Judge (Vice President), empowered to adjudicate in the name of His Majesty the I King of ’Iraq, met on 30th December, 1931, and issued the following judgment The agent of the Plaintiff submitted a claim stating that his client owns one share out of ten shares in a date garden situated in 11 Faddaghiyah, the boundaries of which are known, and that the Defendant has placed his hands on the garden in question and is opposing his client in the administration of her share, and requested that the Defendant should be brought to appear before the Court and ordered to stop his opposition, and to pay the Court fees etc. The agent of the Defendant defended his client saying that his (the client’s) late father, Shaikh Mubarak AX Sabah had bought 146 shares out of 2X6 shares in the date garden in question from Hajjiyah Shafiqah daughter of 'Abdul Hafidh representing herself and, in accordance with her guardianship, her minor children, namely, Hasan, Bahijah, Najiyah, Rafi'ah, Hamidah and Kamilah, for a 'badal' of 3034 Turkish liras and 80 piasters, that he and his heirs had administered the shares in question for a period exceeding the period of prescription, and that the Plaintiff has the right tobring a case for the cancellation of the sale agreement and not to request that the Defendant should stop from opposing her. The agent then requested that the case should he rejected. On 15th duly, 1931, this Court passed a judgment rejecting this case and gave the Plaintiff the right to bring a case for the cancellation of the sale document. The Plaintiff appealed this judgment on the grounds that the date garden in question was miri land and therefore the sale was invalid so long as it was not effected with the permission of the Government official concerned, and that the sale document given by the guardian does not bind the Plaintiff as the property of minors cannot be disposed of without the permission of the lad hi which was not obtained in this case. On 9th November, 1931, the Court referred to above issued a judgment in case No. 148/931 cancelling the judgment appealed and returning the case to this court for reconsideration, provided that the court fees together with Hs. 120 representing the wages of the lawyer for one sitting, and Rs. 150 representing the wages for preparing the statement in reply, should remain outstanding pending the result, as the sanad on which the Defendant relies is invalid because the sale effected outside the Tapu Department without the permission of the official concerned is considered null and void under article 1 of the Ownership of Immovable Property Law and Article 36 of the land Law. The document of sale alleged to be existing requires no case to be brought for its cancellation as no agreement exists. On the date fixed for the second hearing of tue ease, Lawyer Ago* Sttea&amp;U representing the Plaintiff andand Lawyer Muhammad Wasfi Effeadi, representing the Defendant, reported before the Court. The agent of the Defendant was requested to produce a copy of the document of guardianship dated 12th 1 uharram, 1324, which was t&amp;iten as authority by the guardian, Shafiqah, in selling the shares belonging to the minors in question. On producing the document asked for it appeared that the Sharia Court in Basrah had appointed two guardians namely, Ahmad Pasha A1 2luhair and Shafiqah daughter of 1 Abdul Hafidh, to look after the property of the minors, and a Supervisor by the name of ^sa Pasha to supervise the above mentioned two guardians. The agent of the Plaintiff stated that as two guardians were appointed in this case neither of them could sell the property independently, and therefore the alleged sale was invalid because it \ms effected by one of the two guardians for no shari 1 reason. He then requested the court to pass a judgment in favour of his client. The agent of the Defendant repeated his previous evidences requesting that the case be rejected. As there was nothing more to be said they were informed that the hearing was over. .After deliberation : It has been proved from the Khaqstni register produced to the Court, dated 1st August, 1915, Hob. £7 and 28, that the date garden situated in A1 Faddaghiyah, Fao, the land, of which is miri, the trees of which are someones property, and the boundaries of which are as follows:- On the West the property formerly of Shailcha daughter of Yusuf Pasha A1 Zuhair and now of Jabir, Salim, Hasir, Hamad and 'Abdullah tons of Shaikh Mubarak A1 Sabah, cn the East the date garden formerly ofof ’Aisha daughter of T Abdullah Chalabi A1 Zuhair and now of Jab bar, balltn, Hasir, Hamad and r Abdullah referred to above. On the North Waqf, and on the South the river bund belonging to the land ormers. This date garden, the area of which is 123 old donums, is divided into 216 shares. Of the above, ’Abdul Baqi and Hasan, sons of Haji ’All Pasha A1 Zuhair, own 68 shares, 34 shares each, each of Bahijah, Najiyah, Hamid ah, Kamil ah and Hafi’ah (Ilaintiff) o. ns 17 shares, and Shafiqah daughter of ’Abdul Hafidh owns 27 shares. The ^qassam^ issued on 28th May, 1929, by the Sharia Court, Basra.., proves that Shafiqah Khanum daughter of ’Abdul Hafidh died leaving her daughters Bahijah, Bafi’ah, Najiyah, Hamidah and Kamilah, daughters of *Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair, and her grandchildren Qasim and Fattuh, sons of ’Abdul Baqi A1 Zuhair, and Palih, ’All and Hasibah, sons and daughter of Hasan Beg Al Zuhair, as her sole heirs, and that the shares transferred from the deceased to her above mentioned heirs are 120 shares distributed as follows: 16 shares to each of Bahijah, Rafi’ah, Ha^iyah, Hami&amp;ah, and Kamilah, 10 shares to each of Qasim, Falih and ’Ali, and 5 shares to each of Fat tub and Hasibah. It is proved from the evidence given that the Defendant, ShaUch Ahmad Al Jabir Al Sabah ie the person now administering the date garden in question. The agent of the Defendant, in his defenoe, states that his client and his late father had administered this plot of land for a period exceeding the period of prescription, taking as an authority, the document of sale dated 21st Uuharram 1327 concluded between the purchaser, Shaikh Mubarak Al Sabah, and the seller,seller, Shafiqah daughter of ’Abdul Hafidh representing herself and in her capacity as the guardian of her children Hasan, Bahijah, Kajiyah, Hafi’ah, Hamidah and Kamil ah in accordance with the document of guardianship dated 12th Muharram, 1324* The defence made by the agent of the Defendant regarding the lapse of time is rejected because a person 1 s right cannot be lost by lapse of time. As regards the ordinary document which the Defendant has taken as authority for the administration of the garden in question, this document is invalid because all sales of immovable property effected outside the Tapu Department are considered invalid under the provisions of Article 1 of the Immovable Property Law, and because the seller, Shafiqah, was not the only guardian of the minors as it appears from the document of guardianship referred to above that there were two guardians, namely, Ahmad Pasha A1 Zuhair and Shafiqah daughter of ’Abdul Hafidh, and a Supervisor, namely ’Isa Pasha. Therefore the alleged sale effected independently by one guardian is invalid. Therefore and in view of the above it is decided to order the Defendant, Shaikh Ahmad A1 Jabir A1 Sabah, t© stop opposing the Plaintiff,Baft’ah Khanum daughter of ’Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair, in the administration of her 17 shares out of 216 shares in the date garden in question, and of what has been transferred to her from the 27 shares which belonged to her mother, Sli&amp;fiqarid&amp;ug*• t*er ■ f Abdul Hafidh Effendi, and which are registered in the Khaqani register referred to above (Hotes the 27 shares referred to above have been divided into 120 shares out of which 16 have been transferred to the Plaintiff), and to pay the feesfees oi the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal t together with Rs• 90, representing lawyers fees for one sitting, and to allow him discretion to bring a case against Shafiqah* s heirs demanding the 'badal' (money) paid to the guardian in question as the price of the date garden referred to above, under Articles 1674 and 1737 of the Mejalia, Article 1 of the Immovable Property Law, and Clause 2 of the schedule annexed to the Lawyers Wages Regulation. This judgment which is liable to appeal, is declared to both parties in open court this 30th day of December, 1931. mmum«r Translation of a decree No. 66/932 dated 9th May, 1932, issued by the Court of Appeal, Baghdad, for service on Shaikh Ahmad Jabir A1 Sabah, Ruler of Kuwait. Appellor: Shaikh Ahmad A1 Jabir A1 Sabah (Defendant). Represented by Lawyer Iskandar Mansur Iffendi. Appellee: Rafi* ah daughter of ‘All Pasha A1 Zuhair (Plaintiff). Represented by Lawyer Kama! Effendi A1 Sanawi• The 1 Iraqi! Court of Revision, formed of Baud Effendi Samrah, Vice President, and 1 Abdullah Effendi Sal am and Antoine Effendi Shaxrsnas, Members, empowered to adjudicate in the name of His Majesty the King of ’Iraq, met in its capacity as a Court of Appeal on 9th May, 1932, and passed the following judgment:- The Plaintiff submitted a complaint to the Court of Pirst Instance, Basrah, stating that she owns certain shares of a plot of land which is situated at Paddaghiyah, the boundaries of which are known, transferred to her from her father and mother. As the Defendant is opposing her she requests that he should be prohibited from opposing her and that he should pay the (court) fees. On 30th December, 1931, the court in question issued a judgment in the case No. 77/31 prohibiting the Defendant from opposing the Plaintiff in (the administra tion of) her 17 shares out of 216 shares, and what aas been transferred to her from the 16 shares, belonging to her mother Shafiqah, out of 120 shares of the plot oi land under dispute, and compelling him to pay the fees as itit has been proved in the Khaqani register that the Plaintiff and her brothers and sisters own 85 shares, and that the Plaintiff 9 ® mother owned 27 shares which, at the death of the latter, have been transferred to her heirs including the Plaintiff. it has been proved that the person now administering the land is the Defendant who bases his ownership on an ordinary document of sal®. This document cannot be recognised as it includes the sale of immovable property while the seller was not the only guardian of the Plaintiff. Therefore the effect of this sale by her cannot be recognised. The Defendant appealed against this judgment on the grounds that Lawyer Agob Effendi had attended the hearing in his capacity as the Agent of the Plaintiff at the time when the latter had dismissed him, thus his participation in this case, in accordance with a special (ordinary) power of attorney, is illegal*, that he (the Defendant) administered the land for a period exceeding the 'period of prescription' provided for in the Indian Law of Limitation which was in force in Basrah, which makes the hearing of the case illegal; that he had bought the shares belonging to the Appellee from her mother Shafiqah, her guardian; and that he administered the land prior to the date of the document of sale, and therefore the non-hearing of his personal (oral) evidence was illegal. Moreover the civil 'period of prescription' as well passed this 't&amp;sarruf'. In case the land is considered as miri land the Land Law should be applied thereto. The sale, which was made in accordance with the power of attorney, was effected with the permission of the Sharia Court* Had the sale been regarded as illegal, a judgment should have been passed to the effect that the money received by the Appellee through her guardian shouldTae refunded. In view of the above the Appellor demanded that the judgment be reversed, and the Plaintiff’s case rejected, and that the Appellee should pay the court fees etc* the following is the summary of the written statement in reply: The Indian Law of Limitation does not apply to this case* Borsover the period between the dates of its enforcement and repeal is less than the ‘‘period of prescription”, and the request made by the Appellor to hear his evidence regarding *tasarruf* and the application of the 'period of prescription* is not reasonable as he based his 'tasarruf* on an ordinary document of sale which states that the Appellee owns these shares* This confession refutes the 'period of prescription** As the sale of miri land effected without the permission of the Mamur of the Khaqani register is considered illegal, the 'tas&amp;rruf* of the Appellor is also illegal, and in this case the provisions of the Land Law cannot be applied. As the Appellor did not raise a ease in the past demanding that the price should be refunded, he has no right now to claim that price. As regards the sale permission deed, it cannot now be considered as h« (the Appellor) did not present it in the Court of First Instance. The independence of one of the guardians in the administration of the property of minors is invalid. In view of the above it is requested that the judgment from which this appeal has been lodged should be approved and that the Appellor be charged to pay the court fees etc. On the date fixed for the trial, Lawyer Iskandar Mansur Effendi, Agent of the Appellor, and ^awyer Kacral Effendi A1 Sanawi, Agent of the Appellee, appeared before the Court and repeated the contents oi their written statementsa tat ament® respectively. The case having been heard the Court withdrew for discussion. As a result of the examination of the case by the Court of Appeal the important objections raised by the Appellor have been summarised as fallows:• (lj That the hearing of the case was attended by Agob Iffendi # as Agent of the Appellee, after with drawing her power of attorney in his favour. (2) That under both the Civil and Indian Law® the period of prescription has lapsed in this case. The first objection is out of the question because Lawyer Agob Iffendi attended the hearing in accordance with another power of attorney which was unobjectionable. The lady who made this power of attorney in favour of her Agent did not raise any objection, and at the same time no objection to this was raised in the Court of First Instance. As regards the second objection, it appears that the administration of this land by the Appellor was based on the sale agreement dated 21st Muharram, 1327, Aft or examination and taking into consideration the date on which the Indian Law of Limitation was repealed, it appears that the 'period of prescription' did not elapse. The sanad produced falsifies the allegation made by the Appellor in respect of his 'tasarruf* which he demanded to prove by evidence, because the Appellor was allowed possession of this land from the date of the sanad. As regards the civil 'period of prescription 1 *, it is considered that, although a period of time has passed on the 't&amp;sarruf* of the Defendant (Appellor) before the case has been raised, this 'period of prescription' is of no value as long as the Appellor has clearly admitted the ownershipownership by the Appellee of the land under dispute, inis admission is made in the sale document which states that he (the Appellor) purchased the plot of land under dispute from the guardian of the Appellee, As such sales are not recognised, and as the judgment of the Court prohibiting the Appellor from opposing the Appellee in administering the shares under dispute is correct, the judgment appealed is hereby confirmed and the Appellor is ordered to pay the court fees together with 9 dinars, wages of the lawyer for one sitting, plus I,D.11/250, wages for drafting the statement in reply. This decision is issued unanimously under Articles 196 and 198 of the Cod© of Civil Procedure and Article 24 of its Supplement, and declared to both pexties in open Court this 9th day of May, 1932, Certified true copy.

I have set out at length the points made by plaintiff and defendant because at the rehearing no additional pleadings were filed, end the ©as# proceeded cm thess original proceedings and on the arguments recorded in the *dhefet* i.e. record of the case. You will•• 7 *“ V ^ii*i notion thsar# do#®- bm% %% raised % of limitation on wfeleh ymi h&amp;ro laid so much a trass but In fact In the see end hearing this point ms ®x prosaic raised and re corded. in the 5 dhaht and formd the min grounds of tafcia in the second ap^al# 14♦ At this stags 1 will sot out the dates of the dlf decisions* ..hey are: 14-4-.il claim dismissed by Mr Hooper for lack of prosecu tion* fhls is a very ordinary step in a ease and I see no reason to eomment on the remarks of the defendant 1 &amp; agent to . fel » SSs ir Hooper the effect that at that date i*#* before was cosrimced of the Justice of defendant 1 ® ca^e and for that reesonplaintlff witlxdxew her power of attorney from her adrOcste and allowed the case to he dismissed for default.

Against this Judgment an appeal was filed before the Court of Appeal C#A,148 of 19dl» 2he plaintiff appellants (a) challenged the correctness of the 41 missal, Cb) referred to sect ion M of the hand haw and jm&amp;gmmt of the Court of Cassation of coris^antlno ae aatod 13/1/1331 with reference to the ©ala a&amp;da mt&amp;iU Tapu by the Sanaa of # &amp; uharram 1 .C 7 relied on by defendent respondent. ) Urged that -.ho sale of the minor’ the’Qadhi is valid. N property without leaveThe advocate tor defendant respondat aaintained that the decision me correct ana he also claimed that in view of the long possession of this lana the haw of limitation applies. I was present at the hearing of this appeal. fairly complete note was prepared for me and I concurred with the 3ua c es. In inis judgment the court mid that the decision to reject the claim on the ©ingle ground that the plaintiff must first file an action to cancel the deed of sale is wrong 9 in particular at it will appear clear feat this deed i© null and void as a transfer of property using uaue outside Tepu vide sec*1 Immovable Property hot and without permission of the Manur as required under section 56 o* the uand Law and as this transaction was not one merely voidable but i© actually null ana void, no separate action to cancel It la required lei'are to* court can treat it as be in* non-existent. T&amp;e case was therefore remitted for re-nearlng on Its Merits. As this decision was given by Turkieh trained 3-ages ana ie framed in language which presupposes that the uecision la a technical document for xewyers, the following observations will assist you in ro«a.izlng what is the tneory of furnish Law regard in* unregistered sale of Miri land in areas where the Tapu offices function. In BMNV there is a difference between transfer of .aulk (firagh) and transfer of airi (tafweodhj. in Uri lands there is always an ultimate ownership in Oovt. which aay t0 resumed ana section 3b of the -ana law preserved the right of flith—Hit to interfere with the free disposal of suen dlri lend by insisting tnat the permission of ia’mur concerned i.e. the i’apu la’mur should be obtained. Further sueh transfer is legally effected in the Tapu Office only, therefore, unless and until, a transaction affecting Miri.land was registered in Tapu end the consent obtained, usually by endorsementendorsement of the vamur fapu, that transaction was null and void in the jear 1327 and in the eyes of the Law did not exist ti pass property, The consent of the tamur fapu does not appear to be necessary any longer since 1329 but that does not concern the efforts to register this sale. 17* Before going on with the proceedings i will say &amp; word as to why the ?'nu 'aaor refused to give his consent* The Law of the Ottomans is not in favour of immovable property being held by foreigners* ven in the case of Mulk land e.g* houses and small gardens it is only allowed on condition that the foreigner submitted to the laws and courts of the country and as regards Miri land it was forbidden. The Turkish attitude in this matter throughout has been that no sale to foreigners will be allowed and the lovernment tiamur was forbidden to allow this transfer* Under the orders of the Turkish Prime Minister, however, they stretched a ooinfc as regards the known attitude of the Sheikhs of MuhaaBaara and Kuwait towards the Turkish Sta.te and offered to allow them to register their sales if they adraitted that they were Turkish subjects. 18. The Court of ppeal disposed of the first ap eal on the 9th of November 1931 and papers went back to Basrah a-.d on the 14th. of December the Iraqi Vice- President fixed the 23rd of December for the re-hearing, j 1 HQ© the proceediu :, ;s in this part of the cuse i &gt;.vs been attacked because no British judge sat, I must point out that Mr Lloyd was President of the Basrah Court and was in Basrah from 1st of December. *11 British judges know that they should sit if possible in. foreigners cases and 1 cannot believe that any application was made- 11 - to Mr Lloyd to sit in this ease and must therefore presume that the advocate Mohammed W&amp;sfi iiffendi and Abdul Aziz Mfeadl A1 iSalim 1 Badar took no steps to draw the attention of the British President to the case, 1 have read the M dhabt n and it is quite clear that the following points ware raised in argument by the Sheikh of Kuwait’s advocate. (a) fh t in this case limitation ought to run under section 144 schedule 1 the Indian Limitation Act and that the Deri od has elapsed. (b) If the Indian Limitation j ct does not apply, limitation runs under the Law of the country and also has elapsed. On 30 h December 1931 judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff on the following grounds (a) fhat the sale as shewn by the deed of Hist* kuh&amp;rr&amp;m 1327 was null *ind void under section 1 Possession of Land Law. (b) Section 1674 of the lajelle lays down that in vL of the admission of the right of the plaintiff’s ancestor no prescription can be pleaded. Mote* T' r ’iS is the important decision as to limitation ‘ will be discussed later on. at (q) That any event a sale by one $&amp;si witl be invalid. 1 $' On this jud r ment appeal is made to the Court of appeared for the Lheikh as appellant. It is alleged that I was deliberately kept in ignorance of this case. Iskander mnsour is an advocate who often comes to igny r t £ fiy time &gt; are access to the ^resident if he wisjes to poly to him. He made no ef ort to secure my presence Baghdad on appellate work and is quite well aware that he in the case. The case w s heard on t &amp; 9tli 'lay. ii were 5 cases in the list including oce concerning a :: .• r ign There1 o iimlgmr on #:Icfo 1 sat. The parties in the appeal by the Sheikh of Kumit were described: ipnellant: kl Sheikh ithmad nl Sabah. Advocate 1skender r frendi Mansour. Respondent: Hafia bint li Suhair, her advocate Kamal ffendi A1 Sinawi. I note that you apprehend that this omission to inform me that it was a foreigner's case was intention 1. In view of the extremely sharp nature of your conjectures I have asked the Minister to hold special enquiry vide my letter to the Minister dated 16.B.32. copy attached, 1 will only observe that the grounds of appeal filed by Iskender iansour do not state that the Appellant was the Sheikh of Kuwait nor does the copy of the judgment of the First Instance filed with those grounds state that but the Sheikh is described by the title of his Highness and the advocate's Power of ttorney sfeie that he was the Ruler of Kuwait. 20 . The judgment of the Oourt of Cassation sets out the grounds d appeal fully. They are us follow;- (a) Limitation in this case should be in accordance with nara 1.44 Schedule 1 of Indian Limitation act* that the period under this is 12 years, and that 12 ye^rs of actual possess! m had pissed before Basrah Law repeal*:Act of 19Zj took effect *nd ppellant claims to prove this by proving possession before the sale deed was mads. (b) If Limitation under the Indian Limitation act is not g then the Appellant has been in possession for Un necessary period under the Law of the country .and section 2 Q of the Land Code applies which gives prescription of IQ years. {c} Appellant has enjoyed this possession by virtue el a legal sale not in oo-.osition to the wishes of the seller. Although the sale by the one 'Iasi* yet itT &amp;&amp; - 13 - was with permission of the 'adhi and if the court cancel© sale I ask for the recovery of the price. The plaintiff respondent took the points 1ready discussed in the Law Coir t and in particular laid emphasis on section 1674 of the 'ajelie claiming that once an admission of the right of plaintiff’s ancestor had been made a defence of limitation cannot succeed and he also relied on section 1 of the Transfer of Immovable Property Law. As to Limitation under the Indian Limitation ct the period runs from date of Sanad 13-3-1909 to 30th Sept. 1930 i•©.eleven years seveifnonths and a half. The defendant appellant submitted a further statement f grounds of appeal of which the important points are:- (a) The possession exceeded 12 years under the Indian Limitation lot# (b) That the Aadhi had iveo valid permission# ( 0 ) That no permission of luaur T&amp;nu was required. The judgment of the Court of Cassation holds that;- (a) In as much as the ^anad of sale stated that possession of the seller continued up to the data of sale, the possession of the buyer for the purpose of Limitation runs from the data of the Sanad 1 *e. 21st Muharraa .1327 and that 12 years has not expired under the Indian Limitation Act before the Basrah Law Repeal *ct. (b) Under the Law &gt;f the country the admission of a ri^t to titled entirely prevents a subsequent setting uo of Limitation under section 1674 of the Majeile. (c) The sale deed is null and void. 1 have examined the points of limitation under the .-lajelle i. Law of the ountry» $XA there is ample authori'vy i&gt; the remarks of Ali Haidar the Jurist that if a defendant admits that the origin of his possession has derived- 14 - from the plaintiff or his ancestor the defendant cannot plead prescription hut must nrove some other means of acquisition e* &gt; sale. In this case be tried to prove such sale but as the sale was unregistered he cannot rely on this as a transfer of property; as long ago as 1318 ill such transactions outside Tapu were forbidden regarding Mulk and Miri land by Iradah Saniyah. 21. I co?ae now to answer your specific questions: (a) ,,s to ImitutiQn: 1 have set out the view taken by the Court of Cassation and i see no reason to suppose it is wrong except that the view that possession under the Indian Limitation Act only runs from the date of the Sanad is a point on which 1 am a little doubtful; There io, haw ever, much to be said for the view followed by the Court of Cassation that the written admission in the o&gt;an d of sale as to possession commencing with the date of the banad is conclusive against the purchaser even though the Janad itself as a dispoaiti I property is ; ' tm void. reference to the ianad shews that it contains admission that the land is under the possession of seller up to the date of the LanaA and will be possessed by the oheikh oi Kuwait. (b) , tft asm ot nlaint iSi-iiaiaasa: 1 hare already stated that in the r8-hearii« at Basr, separate written pleadings were not filed but that the 'dhabt' a oourt record shews clearly that the point of limitation was argued. 1 have 3 unpli»i copies of all the pleading*. (c) I have explained how I did not cos® to sit in this case. (4) See next pan%jraph. 2Z. Your question (d) presumably refers to the two gardens Bashiya and Fadaghiyah. I do not see wh ,t the ]heikh can do to contest the decision ulready given • -ts- 15 - regards the claims 0 f H fia to 1/1)th. of the Bashija gardea, but he he wishes to apply for a review the grounds are well kn :wn vide section 2? of the amended Civil Procedure Begulations• 01 earl i cannot possibly a dvi se to his aha nee o f success. As regards the Fadaghijuh garden I remind you of the distinction between this garden and .he Bashiya garden; .namely, that it appears from the letter of air Henry Dobbs dated 14th of June 1915 that a Danad Khakani has been issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait. If an action is filed as regards the fa&amp;aghiyah garden the following points will certainly arise: f'O Is the danad Khakani va'iil disposition in Tapu ? (b) If valid so far as the Government is concerned ms it made with the consent of the seller or her heirs? (g) If there ware minors with interests in the garden when does the oeriod of prescription cease. I will here observe that v&gt;ir Henry Dobbi’ letter slews that the entry in the register was made without the consent of the heirs of the sellers. Under Turkish Law it is nossible to file suit to declare void a transaction in Tapu and the point will be taken that it is essential that in such tr nsactions the seller or his agent must be present and admit the sale. As regards prescription for such suit i am unable to say how far prescription my run as the claimant appears to have been a minor at the time of the sale, if a. minor the period of minority must be added to th© period of prescription which. I am informed is 15 years, .in answer to your question I can therefore say that it is doubtful whether the HHeikh can successfully contest th© cisira, assuming the period of prescription is not completed. 23. As regards legislation, this depends on the .generalf - 1;, - conditions surrounding this case. In this natter the Iraq GoTeriaaent stands in the shoes of the Turkish Government. The saine objection to foreigners holding Tiri land prevails. The Turkish view confirmed by the courts was that this transaction is null and void but the Tamur of Tanu would, on behalf of the Government, allow regi strati on, as the sellers agreed, on condition that the purchaser declare himself to be a Turkish subject. I do not see that any political consideration can possibly destroy the legal res©ulis of such failure to register. The Law as to limitation laid down under section 1674 oi the Majelle is peculiar to Faglish ideas but to m© it seems logical. The .re have, been many different decisions as regards necessity or non-necessity of registering land in different parts of Iraq but I am of the opinion that as far as the transaction© in land at Basra is concerned section 36 of the Land Law certainly applied as to permission of Mamur Tape and since the Irada cam jab of 1318 there have been many decisions insisting that sales must be registered or they have no validity, ine first tart of section 1 of Law to dispose of I.amovahle Property 1329 lays this down and applies in Iraq according to many decisions. The Unregistered bales Confirmation p r c ..am'-iion 1G19 affirms this in its 1 reamble* 24 # Generally I am of the opinion that, even if the emission to inform m of the ease, was intentional, the grounds given by the Court of Cassation will be accepted by the Iraq Government r-a being valid grounds f &gt;r determining this claim and unless there is some treaty obligation I do not think that the IraqGovernment will admit ny liability. The argument my be exoreased as follows Minor children 're not bound until they reach majority. They may take any legal steps to recover what they think is their patrimony. The sale by ancestor of plaintiff is null and void. If there is a legal flaw in the title of the purchaser from their father and mother they may recover the estate even though it has enormously increased in value unless they are time barred. They were not time barred at the date of the Basrah law ieoeal ct nd under the Civil Law no prescription can be go d m the aheikh admitted he held Lis titles from the ancestor of Plaintiff. 1 will put the matter in another way. The bheikh of Kuw it has induced the British Government to guarantee his possession of lands to which he cannot (presumably establish his legal title. I draw attention to the following;* ^ It is in fact clear from the conditions of the deed that he was aware of the necessity of registration and aware that there were difficulties he endeavoured against the express provisions of the Law to ensure that the sale should not be considered null. B to the promise by the British Government. the Iraq Government, so you inform me. don’t admit this promise to be binding on the Iraq Government. If there is a dispute between the two Governments, presumably the matter will go to the iape Court. If the G&amp;gue Court holds that this is n international ob 11 gat o n o± l ra« , then, the Iraq Government may have to n&amp;ss a law expropriating those persons who establish their ox-alias in those gardens. If the Hague Court holds that there is no international~ 18 ~ obligation on the Iraq Qovernfnent it seems to me that this becomes a matter between the British Government and the Sheikh of Kuwait and it is for the British Government to decide whether the Sheikh should be compensated* £6* I notice that the Sheikh of Kuwait refuses to employ Mr Mirza ’Uhamned. It will be extremely difficult for the high Comm is loner to get legal opi ion unless some advocate of standing is employed and I am of the opinion that it is advisable to obtain the advice of an experienced local advocate. It may be that the ruling on limitation under the Indian Limitation &gt;ct can be attacked and the ruling that article Z) of the Land Code is subject to the overriding provisions of article 1674 of the Majelle may be challenged by the advocate. 27* The Political Resident of the Gulf ask about the claim to be independent of the Law Courts, all 1 can say is that the Sheikh of • await can raise this point in the 3 cases filed at Basrah. When a fore! n potentate possess land in another country it is easy to believe that the court will not admit that an action affecting immovable property can be excluded from their jurisdiction. 28. The Court gave m order regarding the point rai sed on appeal that a refund of the purchase price should be claimed. There is nothing to prevent the Sheikh claiming to recover this, lie doubt the court did not decide this as it would me an an adjournment tor payment of the court fees on the olai . 29. ihe court did not go into the point whether the second guardian should have joined in the sale. Hie re may be a good deal of subs lance in the &amp;rgu&amp;6u&lt;* th?t when there are two 'h'asis' o . -ast join, failing which a disposition by one can be upset. 3 q i cannot recommend any legislation except toalter ihe application of the lajeHa, to possession of land under article 2,) of the Land Code* 31* Finally do not let it he supposed that I m in favour of the presrnt Civil Code known as the ajalle nor of the provisions of the Land Code. 1 have frequently pressed for the revision of both the injell© and Land Code and you will find my comments in my annual reports especially for 1923, 1924, 1926 ml 1931, conies of which should be in your office.

Oy KJ The^Faddaghiyeh Estates” of the Sheikh of Koweit i nclud e three date properties known as the ”Bashiyeh”, the 'Faddaghiyeh” and the 'Al^Kharam”. They are all known under the general name of 'A1 Faddaghiyeh' and form one of the five Koweit Estates exempted from payment of Iraq taxation by . for services rendered during the war. The*^estates were all purchased by Sheikh Mubarak in 1908 and now, after 23 years of undisputed possession, the heirs of the original owners are being instigated to bring suits against the Sheikh for the annulment of the sales, supporting their claims by an old Turkish law,which enjoined that all sales must be registered with the Turkish Tapu Department. The Sheikh’s properties were not registered with the Tapu Department before the war because the Turks stipulated that the Sheikh should take out Turkish nationality papers, which, on our advice, he refused to do, but the Turkish Law had become practically a dead letter and copies of the deeds of sale etc. were filed at the time in the Political Agency at Koweit in each case. In respect of the Bashiyeh propertil*^ judicial proceedings were instituted some time ago. The Sheikh was successful in the Court of First Instance, but at a second trial a decree was given against him which was upheld by the Baghdad Court; apparently the case was not heard by a British Judge. Although the sale of the Bashiyeh property was a bona fide transaction the transfer was not registered with the Tapu Department after the war in the same way as &amp; 5. tor -f rfi* FaMteliyeh property, owing to the illne.e ani S' subsequent/ V 1I; JiBUtS subsequent death of the vendor. Proceedings in respect of the Faddaghiyeh property are now impending. This property was registered with the Tapu Department in 1915 under the orders of Mr. (now Sir Henry)Dobbs, the Revenue Commissioner in Iraq, and it appears that the plaintiffs propose to plead that this registration was not legal. The position with regard to both properties is stated fairly fully by the Political Agent, Koweit, in paragraph 12 of his letter of 25th June (pages 6-9), It is very probable that these law suits are being instigated from Baghdad in order to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh in connection with his claim to be exempted from Iraq taxation,and the two questions must be considered together. The late Political Resident wrote to the High Commissioner, Iraq, on 11th July last (pages la, lb, 1c) asking for advice in the matter and whether steps could be taken to maintain the Sheikh’s rights. It is not dear whether the Sheikh could contend that his case should have been heard by a British Judge or whether the Indian Law of Limitation^which limits the time during which a suit of this nature could be brought to 12 years, should apply in Iraq. As Sir Hugh Biscoe suggests in paragraph 5 of his letter, it is probable that the Sheikh of Koweit, an independent Ruler, should not be regarded as liable to be sued at all in the Iraq Courts. The High Commissioner replied on 29th July tnat careful enquiries were being made into the facts of the case but since then we have heard no more.

'Bashiyeh” properties judicial proceedings were instituted some time ago, and the shaikh was successful in the Court of the tfirst instance, xhe case was then taken to Baghdad, where apparently a re-trial of the case was ordered, and at the second trial a decree was given against the shaikh which was upheld by the Baghdad Court. 3* As regards the second case dealing with a portion of the 'Eadaghiyeh' estates, proceedings have not yet com menced, but there seems Ho doubt that a suit for the recovery of these properties is about to be brought. The facts of the case are given in Colonel Dickson’s letter, it will be seen that in respect of ikie 4 his Excellency The High Commissioner for Iraq, Baghdad.4c At is ^necessary to trouble xour isxcellency mth copies of the voluminous correspondence aoSk which Colonel Di^lgson refers, it can be summed up very briefly, A perusal of it shows that these properties were purchased by Shaikh Mubarak, who tried to get them registered at Basra, but the Turkish authorities refused to register them unless the Shaikh described himself as a Turkish subject. This he declined to do and in this attitude received our full and constant support, and it is for this reason that the transfer was not registered till 191b, after we had occupied j^asra. isven then, as will be seen, the transfer of the rt ±5ashiyeh’* property was not registered owing to the illness of the vendor, but the deed of sale had air eddy been registered at the uasra Consulate,- &amp; perusal of the correspondence leaves no doubt in the mind of any impartial person that it was a bona fide transaction and it is not disputed that the purchase price was paid. It has been in the possession of the shaikhs of Kuwait for twentythree years and only now is their title disputed. 1 may mention that Shaikh Mubarak in order to obtain registration proposed to get it registered in the name of two of his ladies and a blind xm. son, but even this con cession to the Turks was discouraged by us, 5. 1 am entirely unacquainted with the present judicial regime in *iraq, and do not know whether the Shaikh is in any position to contend that fcbs case should have been heard by one of the British fudges, or whether the Indian Law of Limitation applies. A point, however, which does not seem to have been raised during the proceedings is whether the shaikh of huwait, an independent ituler, is liable to be sued in the Iraq Courts, in any case I should be most grateful if lour excellency would kindly advise me in this matter and let me know whether there are any further steps that the Shaikh of huwait can take to maintain his/ ■&lt;m ^ %&lt;r his rights, / 60 ^ ,s re gards the impending suit in respect of the 'Badaghiyeh' properties, as the a^alkh has now divested his Agent of authority to accept service of summons, i presume the summons will be sent through lour excellency to me for service on him, and the question will then definitely arise as to whether he is subject to the jurisdiction of the ifcaq Coufcts, x have the honour to be, Sir, iour most obedient servant, SD/ n« v .

Sir, I have the honour to refer you to the conversation which you had with His Excellency the Shaikh on your last visit to Kuwait, when the latter brought uji the question of the activities of certain claimants to his 'Faddsghiy h* pro perties and protested that they were receiving wrongful assistance from the Iraq Courts. 2. At the time I was not in a position to give you particulars of the case as the Jhaikh had previously only touched on the matter in conversation with me. You there fore suggested tnat the hhaiklKs Agent in j&amp;srah should be sent for, and that after obtaining from him lull details of what had happened 1 should report the matter to you. 5. ter your departure Abdul Aaia as Salim al Badr the aged and trusted Agent of Shaikh Mubarak, who later served Shaikhs Jabir and Salim al Subah in the same capacity, and who to-day looks after the present Euler’s properties and interests in Iraq was duly summoned to Kuwait# 4. He arrived on the 8th June and by order of the Shaikh called on me and explained the whole history of the group oi gardens known as the *Eaddaghiyeh” estates, from tne day they were bought by Shaikh Mubarak al Subah, down to the present t iiiie • • • • •-2- 3 time* 5. A8 it was difficult for me to remember all lie told me X asked him to put everything down in the form of a short report and submit same to the Shaikh* The latter by previous arrangement had agreed to pass it on to me without delay* 6* I now beg to submit for your information and considera tion a translation of His Excellency’s letter JSq.R/ 475, dated the ilth Safar 1351 ( 15th June 1932) which 1 have marked *A” , forwarding a copy of his agent’s report, which also I have had translated* This latter as far as it goes speaks for itself. 7. To my mind the questions involved are of far greater significance than appear at first sight, and 1 am inclined to give credence to the story reported to me by the aged agent of the Shaikh, that the attacks on the Shaikh’s property form part of a plot on the part of a group of very clever and un scrupulous advocates in Basrah, whether supported or not from Baghdad is not for me to say, to get money out of the Shaikh of Kuwait, by putting up irresponsible parties to contest his right to enjoy properties which his grandfather Shaikh Mubarak had bought as far back as 1908, supporting their claims by an old Turkish haw which for many years previous to the Mr , had become practically a dead letter, as xar as large portions oi Iraq and lower Mesopotamia were concerned* Chaotic conditions existed in that country during the later days of hult&amp;n Abdul Hamid, and on the rise of the ^young Turky Party” and had resulted in the breakdown of the Turkish administration in the Basrah vilayet* This especially applied to the T&amp;pu department whose laws officially required that the public should register the sale and pm*chase of all property in the liwa Tapu offices? but which in the case of lower Iraq and the southern \ *. •.3 soutlwirfi Buphrate® vail ey in p&amp;r£i$ttl&amp;r Ixad liteda® go r^ u q H q£ a dead letter, that vaet proper tie® Ranged hand® regularly under deed of sale drawn up &amp;y seller and purehaaer, and witneaaed fey friends,etc*, no record at all being mde in the local 'Xapu* office* S* Shaikh /ihaaad on the other laand has unfortunately got fl It deeply fixed in hie mind that the present Iraq Government have taken on the Turkish •’mantle 1 * and will never rest until they force Kuwait to come within their orbit* He more than hinted to me in the course of a long conversation whio I imd with him yesterday that he believed the present attack was directly inspired from Baghdad, in revenge for hi© having so far refused to *toe the line w , where his f&amp;o estates were concerned* He is very alarmed, in consequence and appears t© see in the attack on his 'Bashiyeh* gardens of the taddaghiyeh estate, and the coming suit which is about to be filed against himself, in respect of i/3 of the F&amp;dd&amp;ghiyeh proper, a new method of trying to force him to come to terms, over his 5 i ; : ' 'exempt H properties* In the sam© convcroation the ihaikh rather pathetically passed the following remark which ^repeat as far as 1 can romemoer the words - 11 can you blame me if I am forced to look on Iraq and her present rulers in the same light as my grandfather looked upon the Turks. They are the sons of the same people who used to attack him, and are only waiting to free themselves from your mandate to rake up all the old intrigues and form© of pressure which were so skilfully brought , to bear on Kuwait in the old days* These new attacks are assuredly comin.i, and will give you English and me an infinity of trouble again* It is only history repeating itself and unless you stop Iraq with a firm hand now, while you are still the Mandatory lower, I call aod to witness, that the blame for-4- all future trouble will lie at your door* 4 -* 9. Lest perhaps you have not realised it, the 'Faddaghiyeh' estates include three date properties known as the ^Bashiyeh**, the ^Faddaghiyeh* and the *A1-Kharam rt * They are all known under the general name of that *A1 Faddaghiyeh*♦ They consist in all of about 480 jeribs, and form one of the five Kuwait estates exempted from payment of Iraq Revenues by His Majesty* s Government for services rendered during the great iar. 10. The purchase of these Faddaghiyeh gardens (all three) was made in 1908 by Shaikh Mubarak and resulted in a veritable 'cause celebre* at the time. Q The Turks who wished to bring pressure on Mubarak for having entered into treaty relations with us, ordered that the sale, even though £ T.60,000/- changed hands, should be declared null and void, unless Shaikh Mubarak took out Turkish nationality papers. This, backed by us, he refused to do, seeing that the whole object of his, and o policy, had been to show that he did not admit the overlordshij of the Turks. Hence incidentally his treaty with us# 11. In order that you may properly appreciate the history of the case from the beginning, as well as the interests involved, I would urge you, even at the cost of some trouble, to read through the old records which will be found in the Residency archives at Bushire. To assist you, I have gone through the files at this end, and append in the max gin a list of relevant letters which passed between previous Political Agents of Kuwait, the Political Resident, the Government of India and His Majesty* s Consul at Basrah, etc. between the years 1909 and 1913.

To enable you also to get an immediate picture of what has recently happened and may happen in the near future, I append the following facts in amplification of the report of the Shaikh’s Agent mentioned at the beginning of this letter*(a) The 'Bashiyeh* gardens. (Faddaghiyeh estate) This was originally the property of Ali Pasha bin passim al-2uh&amp;ir and was sold in 1908 by his wife the lady 'Shafiqah' for approximately £ T # 4489/- to Shaikh Mubarak# this lady sold the property on her own behalf and on he half of her daughters, she being the sole executrix, under documents issued by the Basrah Sharia Court dated 2nd Mu^Charram 1324 and 2nd Muhar ram 1327 respectively# 27 of the leading notables (ashraf) of Basrah including His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah, the Maqib of Basrah Seyed Talib Pasha, and six of the leading members of the al Zuhair family, a decendant of whom is now involved in the case# refused to recognise the sale unless Shaikh Mubarak accepted Turkish nationality# hor was the deed of sale registered in the British Consulate, as were the papers connected with the *faddaghiyeh rt sale (see (b) below) because of the difficulty of pers Consul# During the British Occupation, in 1915 to be exact when the Revenue Commissioner Mr* Dobbs (later Sir H#Dobbs) issued Tapu documents in favour of the Faddaghiyeh and Al Khar am gardens, (see (b) below) he was unable to do so in the case of the Bafchiyeh gardens because 'Shafiqah' had fallen suddenly ill* As she died dhortly afterwards, the matter of the «Tapu n papers unfortunately remained in abeyance v- an occurrence not considered dangerous at the time# | '4 \ To-day after being in possession for 25 years without *••• Complete sale deeds were drawn up and witnessed by Bo Tapu documents were taken out, because the Turks \\-7- ? without any contestants coming forward, the present Ruler of Kuwait has a shit filed against him toy the penniless husband of *Rafiah* daughter of Shafiqah, and more startling still loses his case, apparently because his agent could not produce a *Tapu 18 Sanad of official Title deed* At the final appeal in Baghdad, if one may believe the statement of the Shaikh’s agent, no British Judge heard the case nor did the arguments put up by the defence, carry any weight, which were to the effect that under the 11 Law of Limitation* 1 the sale could not be annulled* lb) The ffaddaffhiveh &amp;arden (Faddaghiyeh -state. This was sold by a lady called *Aishah wife of Ahmad Pasha al guhair, to Shaikh Mubarak for £*T*60,000/» also in 1908* The sale deeds were attested by the British Consul in Basrah, under instructions from Sir iercy Cox, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, because of the fact that the Turks refused to recognise the sale unless^- Mubarak took out Turkish papers of nationality* In 1915 Mr. Dobbs (later Sir Dobbs) the Revenue Commissioner ordered the Tapu department to register the property in the name of the Shaikh of Kuwait. This was done* To-day Abdallah Beg an -uhair son of Isa Pasha as iuhair who was one of the signatories to the original sale dedds claims as far as can be gathered that is entitled to a third portion of the 'Faddaghiyeh* tram ins mother ’Aisha, and encouraged by the result of th* 'Bashiyeh' case, and also according to the Sh&amp;itcMs Agent, •gged on by certain 'shady' attorneys in Basrah (who are willing to be paid by results only) has filed or is about * * •/ Ovtc n «• @w&gt; to file a suit against the Shaikh, which if sueceseful will mean the break-up of the Fadd&amp;ghiyeh garden also* It is said, but of this I naturally cannot be sure, that the line of attack is to take the form that Mr.Dobbs had no legal right to issue Tapu documents* In any case it seems that the actual sal© of the property will be contested under the argument that *Aisha 1 s husband who visited Kuwait and carried through the sale, had no proper power of attorney from his wife, at the time the sale was effected* As in the previous case (a) it will be observed that the Al Subah have been in uncontested possession for 23 years* 13, It is of course impossible for me to enter into all the details connected with these two cases in the present report, nor am I competent to discuss them on the legal merits, lacking as 1 do the necessary knowledge, but it may be of interest to you to know that copies of all deeds of sale as well as 'wakalaa* etc. were filed in this Agency at the time the sales took place, by such experts in lav/ as -*©4 Knox and the late Captain Shakespear, and nothing was put on record to bring suspicion on the bon&amp;fides of the saxes« I myself have gone through these deeds, and. ci»s far as I can see, all were drawn up in clear, proper and above-board manner* 14. The present Shaikh of Kuwait, who has put to much expease over the 'Bashiyeh' case, feels that he himself has done enough in trying to gx fight his battles single-handed. | He seems obsessed with the idea now that he has no chance in the Iraq Courts, and is emphatic that it was by no accident that the hearing of his final appeal in Baghdad took place in the absence of a British judge. \ 15*(», to -4 15* I naturally find it difficult at this end to say what line should be taken, but if such course be possible I would strongly urge that His Excellency the High Commissioner be asked to call for the papers as far as the 'Bashiyeh' case is concerned and have them examined by his legal adviser* Presumably His Excellency is the highest Court of Appeal where British subjects and British protected subjects are concerned, so long as the Mandate is still in existence• As regards the 'Ifaddaghiyeh** case, if a suit is filed it would seem that the 3haikh is on stronger ground, with Sir Henry Dobbs’ tt Tapu Sanads* in his possession, but even so there ought to be some way of stopping proceedings at the commencement, on the grounds that the Shaikh has held indisputed possession of the property for 25 years. Should His Excellency desire to see files giving the whole history of the case X am quite prepared to send the papers to Baghdad if you authorise me to do so. 16. This report, though 1 realise its shortcomings, is forwarded in the hope that you, having been put in posses sion of essential facts, will be able to do something to ease the situation and calm the Shaikh’s fears. The question in my opinion is closely mixed up with the Shaikh’s 'exempted* properties and so in a sense forms part of that thorny problem. In any case it is one which requires fading before the 'Mandat e*runs out, if the independence of Kuwait is to mean anything via a vis Iraq, or if our position in Kuwait is to be made secure from incessant intrigues of $his nature. 17. In conclusion I attach a copy of a letter with enclosure dated 14th June 1932, which X have marked and which I have recently received from Khan Bahadur Mirssa Muhammed, C * I «, agent to Shaikh Khazaal in Baarah*. $hiit person . • •10- pereon as you know is a lawyer. I have shown the Shaikh the letter and have suggested that he fall in with Er. Mlrza Muhammad 1 s suggestion but, I am sorry to say, that he has declined the offer, firstly because he says that he suspects Mr. irza Muhamnad of running with^hare and hunting with the hounds and cannot trust him, and secondly because in his own words, he feels that in whatever action he takes the 'dice* will be too heavily loaded against him in any Iraq Court. He prefers he says to rely on the efforts of His Majesty’s Government under whose protection he is and to whom he now appeals. 18. In the meantime the Shaikh has officially informed his agent in Basrah, that he no longer represents his interests in matter® connected with suits filed in the courts by private individuals against himself {the Shaikh). this means 1 suppose that all service of documen by the courts on the Shaikh will in future have to be made through His Excellency the High Commissioner’s office and may raise the interesting point as to whether an Iraq subject can institute proceedings against an independent ruler. On this point 1 admit I am ignorant. 19 I am sending you three spare copies with this report I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant /: 7 Lt.-Colonel / political Agent, KuwaitCOPY [F H A W v Translation of a letter .

From it you will understand the history of the case and the causes that have given rise to recent happenings• We request you to kindly consider this case with most careful eye. Usual Bnding*Cepy » .5) Translation of a note on the Paddaghiyeh properties prepared by ’Abdul *Azia as-Salim al-Badr, Agent of His Excellency the shaikh of Kuwait in Basrah and submitted on 15th June 193S to His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait. As Your Excellency desires to know the way by which Eaddaghiyeh estates have been bought, from the begin ning ujjto the result of the recent suit filed by Rafi’ah bint ’All Pasha aa-^uhair, I beg to submit a full report on same, together with a remark regarding what we may be faced with in the future. 2. In the year 1326 (1908) Ahmad Pasha bin C^asim aa-Auhair, a prominent landowner of Basrah, came to Kuwait, and according to a power of attorney (I'akalah) which was signed and sealed by one Mustafa Kadhim Eff, then ^adhi of the Gallata quarter in Constantinople, and which was given by the said Ahmad Pasha’s wife, 1 Aishah bint ’Abdullah Chaiabi az-Auhair, who was then residing in Constantinople, he sold the piece of land named Jadd&amp;ghiyeh (400 ^aribs approximately} to Shaikh Mubarak as-Subah. The transaction toot place in the town of Kuwait, and 1 was ordered by Shaikh Mubarak to arrange the transfer of the property in the fi Xapu w Department and get the ”Tapu” deeds made out in the names of his sons. I left Kuwait for Basrah, and there 1 started all necessary transactions connected with the *T&amp;pu tt Depart ment, but at the moment of paying the fees and bringing the mat er to a conclusion an order dated 9th February 1328 (Rumi) was received from the Department of the Imperial Registers (in Constantinople) to the effect that it should be recorded in the Tapu title-deeds that the buyers were Ottoman subjects. Owing to this extraordinary condition all transactions were stopped, as the Anglo-Kuwait treaty did not •..not allow Shaikh J&amp;ubarak to accept Ottoman nationality. 3. At the sane time the ©mail date-palm property 31 adjoining the above, called the ?, Bashiyeh w Jariba approximately) which had been the property of the heirs of •Ali Pasha bin q&amp;sim Pasha aa-subair, and of which o n e ©.ixth had come to Ahmad pasha as-^uhair by inheritance from his mother Fatimah bint Jasim al-iiisiiari, was also sold to Shaikh Mubarak by Shafiqah bint ♦Abdul H&amp;fidh, who was the executrix as per an executorship issued by the Jhar* Court, Basrah, and dated the 2nd Muharram 1324, and the one authorised person who could sell the abovementioned piece of land , as per permission issued by the dhar*Court, Basrah, and dated the 2nd Muharram 1327. 1 had gone through all necessary formalities to transfer this piece of land also, but was compelled to give the matter up for the same reasonl Turkish naturalisation). On the - 26th Jamad Auwal 1323 and on 6th Kajab 1328 (13th July 1910)Shaikh Mubarak wrote to Sir Percy Bu© hi re, informing him of the position, and on the 28th J&amp;mad Auwal 1328 he received a reply from him to the effect that he had reported the matter to H.M.u. he further instructed Shaikh Mubarak to obtain the usual title-deeds and get them attested by the notables of Basrah, and informed him that H.M.G. would protect the property from any encroachment. Shaikh Mubarak, therefore, ordered me to do this, and also to get Hi© Majesty's Consul in Basrah to countersign the deeds of sale# : s Ahmad Pasha bin pa aim Pasha aa-^uhair was a representative in the Ottoman Parliament, and as he cou3^, * '*v. not remain longer in Baarah, he appointed 'Abdul Jahimb Pasha al-Ciirtaa aa an agent on behalf of himaell ctnd .ais wife . •«^[o\ an /c were issued in their place, but the documents which were given by Shafiqah (i.e.Bashiyeh estate) could not be substituted for Tapu title-deeds, as they had not been count erained by the British Consul, because Shafiqah had not herself been present in the Consulate* X 9 therefore, approached Shafiqah over the question of transfer, but owing to her very poor health matters were delayed month after month. Eventually losing her minor son Hasan and then her other son 'Abdul Baqi, she herself also died. How after 2B years the husband of i afi'ah, a daughter of Shafiqah, egged on by certain lawyers of Basrah who have told him that according to Article 36 of the Turkish Tapu Law, all sales that took place outside the jurisdiction of the Tapu Department can be considered as null and void, has brought a spit for the annulment of' the sale, as far as her share of the property was concerned. This suit was actually filed against us, and I the agent of (Shaikh Mubarak) defended the case, I not only point ed out the long time which had passed, namely 23 years, during which we had enjoyed full possession of the property un challenged, but put all relevant documents before the Court. The President of the Court, Mr.Hooper, was convinced of the justice of our case, and when our opponents (plaintiff's counsel) perceived that he, the judge, was going to compare the seal with the copy which was available with the clerk of justice, lie intimated to Rafi'ah, the person by whom he had been instructed, to send him a telegram from Subair dismissing him from his attorneyship, and to send a copy of the telegram direct to the Court. The trial was therefore postponed till next say, as the office hours were over. Hext • • «~5- Sext day when the plaintiff's attorney and the defen dent were both called for, the former did not appear on the pretence that he had been dismissed# The Court therefore decided to send a summons to the plaintiff and ask her to present herself, or send an attorney on her behalf after fifteen days, but neither she nor her attorney appeared on the day fixed# The court, therefore, passed a decree by default, open to objection and appeal, and saddled the plaintiff with all costs. Thbs was on the 14th April 1931. The plaintiff next appealed against such decree being passed in default, and asked for a retrial of the case# On the 7th July 1931 the court again assembled and both parties were called for# The President asked the plaintiff i counsel whether the property had come into the hands of the as-Sabah by deed of sale or not, and the reply was that there had been a false sale, and that any deal oased on false* hood, was null and void, and that in the present case the property was considered to h&amp;Ye been usurped# i»ev©theless the court passed a decree rejecting the plaintiff s claim, but allowed h©rj^(Kafi \ ah) the right of appeal# The plaintiff had again to pay costs# This took place on the 15th July 1931, and the judge was Ibrahim ash ahabandar# The next step in this case was that an appeal was made on the 9th lorember 1931 to hadad# The Court of appeal passed a decree upholding the appeal, and it sent the documents to the court for re-examination# On the 20th December 1931 the court passed a decree against the ohaikh of Kuwait and ordered him to pay all costs in the retrial# The court however gave him the option of filing a suit against the heirs of the executrix Shafiqah Dint 'Abdul R&amp;fidh, to recover the original monies paid for the property, according • •«•according to Articles 1674 and 1732 of the *M&amp;jella% and Article 1 of the Law of Possession of liamovable Property, During the appeal proceedings no defence witnesses were called or heard, and the British President did not attend the trial# The above decree was passed by the Deputy President ’Abdul Hamid, On the 17th March 1932 I appealed, and pleaded in defence, w lapse of time* according to Article 144 of the Indian Law, and I pointed out that Article 4 of the * Order of Basrah Laws of 1920'* confirmed that my claims which had been rejected under such law, could not be preferea a ,ain. and that it was illegal i;o raise them, aaew . I also pointed out that the person by whom j. had been intrusted and his prede cessors, had continually administered the property claimed, for a period of 23 years which far exceeded that fixed by the abovement 1 oned Law, but the Court of Appeal paid no attention to my defence* Kor did the British judge attend the trial, as I had a right to expect that he would, seeing that I was representing the Shaikh of Kuwait, an independent state under the British Protection* The previous deere ^ _ inst the Shaikh was confirmed, but Shaikh Ahmad was given the option of filing a suit against the heirs of Shafiqah, the executrix, to recover the value of the property from them. Should the above decree be enforced, It will be easy for the other heirs to claim their shares also. There are mischievous people also, who are at the present moment trying to persuade ’Abdullah Beg bin ’Isa Pasha as- Auhair, one of the heirs of ’/.ishah who sold the P&amp;ddaghiyeh estate to Shaikh Mubarak, to reopen the whole of the Faddagh- iyeh sale question* They even offer him Rs* 10,000/- to appoint them as attorneys on his behalf so that they may file a suit for the cancellation of the Tapu title-deeds issued by Mr* Dobbs* Relying *«• •1327, -7- n Relying on the evidence of the British Consul, Basrah, and the part lie has played, I submit this report to the person whose attorney I am, namely His Excellency Shaikh Idnnad al- Jabir for his information, so that he my be aware of the particulars of the case from the beginning till the end.

H*R.P*Dickson f C.I*B. f I,A. political With regard to the matter of Fadt aghiyeh, which I mentioned to you the otner day, I append herewith a short precis of the circumstances of the case which I hare gather ed from a lawyer-friend of mine. As I predicted, one of the heirs of the original owner of the property is about to file a suit (or might have done so by now) against the Shaikh of Kuwait for one third of the property. Personally, I do not wish to interfere in this matter, as one of the daughters of Ahmad Pasha aa-^uhaxr is an old friend of mine. I have two learned friends, Aessrs.Jacob Gabriel and Arteen, who are willing to represent the Shaikh in the matter if the Shaikh intrusts them with his case. Both of them are reliable and competent and are as good as any lawyer 1 can find here. I may go even so far as to say that no ether lawyer enjoys my pergonal confidence as much as they do. They are willing to take up the Shaikh’s case, provided he pays them a fee amounting to of the amount of the suit, half the fee to be paid in advance and the other half later if they succeed in winning the case. if the Shaikh agrees to their proposal, they will make a written agreement with him, to be attested by you, on the above lines. 1 have thought it desirable to mention these facts to you, as you may desire to discuss the raatter with the Shaikh* My friends are almost sure that they will win the faction of feeling that I have randered a service to the \ \ Agent, Kuwait case for the Shaikh. If they do, I shall have the satis*«*2«* Shaikh* and i hope that he will prove more helpful to me in conneotion with the claims of the Shaikh of Mahammer&amp;h. I may add that the case of Baghiyeh which was lodged against the Shaikh by the heirs of All Pasha ajs-huhair, is quite different from this case, which relates to the main property called Fad&amp;aghiyeh# Mr, Gabriel was the attorney for the plaintiffs in that suit* With best compliments and kindest regards*COgY.

The feeling that the Iraq authorities are themselves 'v V fermenting these and other troubles for the Shaikhs of Kuwait is daily increasing and naturally causes one no little \ concern. 5. Kuwait has gone out of her way to live on terms of friendship and amity with her northern neighbour ever since •; . the • • *-2- the Arab Government was set up in Iraq and is above all anxious that good relations be maintained* This is not JL surprising seeing that many of pQT public men own property and have close trade connections with Basrah, while almost all the petty supplies that the town depends on come in daily from the Jhatt-al-Ar&amp;b region* 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd/- E*R«P* Dickson, X&lt;t • Colons 1, Political Agent, Kuwait • * * • •Translation of a letter Bo#11/478 dated the 22nd dafar 1931 (26th June 1932) from His xcellency the Euler of Kuwait, Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait# Along with our letter lio#H/475 dated the 11th dafar 1351 (15th June 1932) we forwarded to you a copy of the report submitted by our agent Abdul Aaia bin Halim al-Badr which showed how the M Paddaghiyeh H properties had been bought. Ho doubt you have become aware of the result of the suit filed by Hafioh bint Ali Pasha as-Huhair, Indeed, I am dis pleased with the treatment of the Iraq Government towards me in this connection, as the piece of pal^-tree land, which is named the 'Bashlyeh* and against which the claim has been raised, already belonged to the heirs of Ali Pasha ajs-^uh&amp;tr, and its sixth share fell to Ahmad Pasha az-^uhair by in heritance from hie mother Fatimah bint Jasim al-Mishari, and it was sold to my late grandfather Shaikh Mubarak by Shafiqah bint Abdul Hafidh, wife of Ali Pasha az-Auhair. She sold this piece of land on behalf of herself, and by virtue of her guardianship over her (minor) sons, according to a deed issued by the ahar* Court at Basrah and she had been authorised to sell it according to a permit issued by the t Shar* Court at Basrah on the 2nd Muharram 1327# Just when the fees were being paid and the transactions completed, an order was received from the office of the Imperial Registers (Constantinople) to the effect that it should be mentioned in the fapu documents that Shaikh Mubarak and his offspring were Ottoman subjects# Owin w to this condition the transfer transactions were all stopped, as my late grandfather was on his guard against this very condition# He therefore wrote to Sir Percy Cox requesting his advice on the case, and the latbrx that he had reported the matter to His Majesty* s Government,axid that he the Shaikh should definitely not aii r ee to his offspring being registered in the Tapu document, as Ottoman subjects. The latter also instructed him to get possession of ordinary document a and get them attested by the hobility of Basrah, and (said that) the British Government would protect vae property when it become necessary. Shaikh Mubarak followed the instructions of the latter, got possession of ordinary documents and occupied tiie property. As to the larger part of the Faddaghxyeh, which my late grandfather Shaikh Mubarak bought from Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair according to the power of attorney which the latter had received from his wife Aishahj this part was transferred through the Tapu department after British Occupation, because Ahmad Pasha on behalf of himself, and as representing his wife hi shah, had appointed Abdul uahab P&amp;sha(al ^irtas) as his representative, and the said Abdul Wahab Pas^. according to his representative power on behalf of Aishah, and of the one sixth of the 'Bashiyeh' which belonged to Ahmad Pasha, came before the British Consul, Basrah, who witnessed the sale deeds. It was because they relied on his witness that Hi® Majesty’s Government later issued orders for the registration of the abovaaentioned property in Tapu. As to Shafiqah, she being a woman could not come before the British Consul, and her documents, therefore,remained uncertified. The transfer dealings were postponed from time to time until she and both her minor sons Hasan and Abdul B&amp;qi died, but Hafiah (her daughter) roused by mischief mongers, has now filed this suit. Our agent and her attorney had to plead for her share from the 'Bashiyeh”. But we regret to say that the Court would not listen to the defence of our agent3 'lO' ^ in anythin^at all.

These rested on claims that the original sales were not correctly registered with the Tapu Department under the old Ottoman Law, as the Shaikh had refused to take out Turkish nationality papers. The file also concerns changes to the tax-exempt status of the date gardens, following the instigation of the Istihlak tax by the Government of Iraq. Questions arose as to whether the Government of Iraq was obligated to guarantee the tax-exempt status originally granted by HM Government (HMG), and whether HMG was obligated to compensate the Shaikh for loss of revenue.
