I would be glad to receive your confirmation of above ao that I can inform Shaikh of Bebai who has not so far been approached. It seems desirable that Shaikh of Sharjah should also be given some previous warning of proposal since it is unlikely that when he gave his consent to improve ments in existing air facilities (Political Agent Bahrain’s telegram Ho.390 October 25th) he fully appreciated that this meant the stationing of a large force at Sharjah.
