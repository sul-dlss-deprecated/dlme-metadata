S.W.1. September, 1949 Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No* L 3011 /o 1,/402 of the 28th July concerning the file at His Majesty^ Embassy at Jedda relating to the administration of a charitable rest house named Rampur Rubat, maintained by the Ruler of the State of Rampur for Indian pilgrims, I am directed by Mr* Attlee to state that he has now been informed by His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Indian Consul has looked through the papers and decided that there is no need for him to take possession of them* This particular case therefore is now closed* 2. His Majesty’s Ambassador has asked however for an indication of the principle to be followed in such cases as he is likely to receive similar requests from the Pakistan Legation or Indian Consul either for unlimited access to, or actual possession of, particular old papers. I am to enquire therefore whether the Secretary of State for_Commonwealth Relations would have any objection to such files being transferred, provided that, as suggested in Commonwealth Relations Office letter Pol*Ext. 7747/49 °f the 17th August, the files are first examined by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Jedda to confirm that they contain no papers which would be harmful to our good relations with India and Pakistan* I am. Sir, , Your obedient Servant, r/ ■r I In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. L 3011/51/402 and address— not to any person by name but to— ' The Under-Secretary of State/’ 28th July, 1949 Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. c Sir, I am directed by Mr. Attlee to inform you that he has recently been advised by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Jedda that the local Indian Consul has requested that certain files should be transferred to him. The papers in question relate to the administration of a charitable rest house named Rampur Rubat which is maintained by the Ruler of the State of Rampur for Indian pilgrims. 2. The Rampur Rubat has been administered since 1914 by His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda. Since the State of Rampur has now been absorbed into the United provinces of India, however, responsibility for the administration of the Rubat has now devol ved upon the Indian Consul at Jedda. 3. Before complying with the Indian Consul’s request His Majesty’s Ambassador has referred the question to the Secretary of State to ensure that there can be no objection to the papers being transferred. I am to enquire, therefore, whether there is any trace in your Branch of correspondence concerning the Rampur Rubat as there are no relevant papers in the Foreign Office. 4. If, as appears to be the case, the correspondence in question is of a purely local nature Mr. Bevin proposes to inform His Majesty’s Ambassador that there is no objection to the suggested transfer. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant Sir The Under-Secretary of State, Commonwealth Relations Office, (India Branch).</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000380_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1406</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000380</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1406</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Pol Ext 7747/49 'Administration of charitable rest house Rampur Rabat, Jedda, maintained by ruler of the state of Rampur: scrutiny of earlier papers by Indian consul'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-08-17T22:17:39</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (6 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 8, these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence relating to a request made by the Indian and Pakistani Consuls in Jeddah, for access to files in the possession of the British Government’s Ambassador.
