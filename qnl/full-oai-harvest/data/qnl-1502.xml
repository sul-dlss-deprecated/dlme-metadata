Volume two is inscribed 'Received under Foreign and Political Department endorsement 147EA of 22.6.16'. The documents contain transcripts of fifteen treaties and undertakings between the British Government and the Rulers of Bahrain in English and (at the rear of the volumes) in Arabic. In addition to agreements dated by year only, the agreements relate to piracy, the slave trade, arms traffic, observance of treaties, jurisdiction over foreigners, pearl fisheries, post office, wireless telegraphy, and oil. A note at the start of the agreements states that in the event of doubt about the precise interpretation of any portion of the English and Arabic text, the English text was to be considered decisive.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sitrah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sitra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>New Delhi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002cb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
