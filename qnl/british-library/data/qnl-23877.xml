Bahrain . — ^ from Letter No.L/6/160 dated 13-5-48 fcg I.E.I. Bahrain, H It is for consideration whether the stand taken by I.B.I, and E.B. to charge the Government commission on remitr tances to India and other places (other than Dubai and Kuwait/ is fair. The Agency extends to these banks several courtesies ^ (use of diplomatic bags, to mention only one) and the least that the banks can do is to enable us to make remittances^at| par. Till very recently our treasuries had been operating and we were able to make Government remittances at par. On many an occasion we had extcndsdour good offices to enable the banks to bring large sums of money (species, &amp;c.) from India without heavy expenditure and enabled them to remit species at concessional rates.
