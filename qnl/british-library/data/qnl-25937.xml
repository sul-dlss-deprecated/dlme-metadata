' R. 10.00 a.a. BST 19th September I saw the Prime Minister last evening by appointment and found the Minister for Foreign Affairs with him. Both Ministers spoke with great anxiety of the situation in Northern provinces of Persia* The Prime Minister said he had received a telegram from the Acting Governor General of Azerbaijan asking to be relieved of his post and allov/ed to return to Tehran as he feared that Tudeh would in a few days time usurp the functions of Government and take over the administration. According to the Prime Minister Tudeh had already established its authority at Maragheh and at Upthi in Mazanderau. In the latter district they controlled all movement on the railway and did not hesitate arbitrarily to stop trains, remove passengers, and arrest, imprison or beat up anyone of whom they disapproved. This state of lawlessness was spreading. As an example the Prime Minister quoted the case of the Governor of Gurfan 'who had been ordered by Tudeh to leave and had arrived in Tehran in a state of collapse after being beaten and narrowly escaping with his life. The Russian Military authorities at Kasvin had also recently adopted a more unfrienly attitude and the Prime Minister stated that he new had definite evidence that Tudeh* s accomplices through out the area were obtaining arms from the Soviet. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he had received a telegram from the Persian Embassy in London declaring that a Senior Foreign Office Official had advised Taqizldeh to urge the Persian Government to do its uttermost to avoid any incidents, and to refrain from any action which could possibly be construed by the Soviet authorities as provocative. The Prime Minister claimed that this was precisely what he was trying to do and would continue to do but such a situation could not be maintained indefinitely and he saw little cause for hope unless a favourable decision about early BY TIIE AUTHORISE^ RECIPIENT ^ ™ [CYPHER] CABINET D )$l FROM TEHRAN TO Mr. Mbnypenny, No. 1014.

(BoT) 15th September, 1945 Repeated to Tehran * * * My immediately following telegram contains summarv of Tass message^irom Tehran reporting movement for serai-autonomous Azerbaijan as a Federal unit within Persia. 2. Since the question of withdrawing our own and Soviet troops from Persia became actual some weeks ago the press campaign here against the present Persian Government has increased in intensity. Items have appeared almost every day criticising alleged in is government and reactionary tendencies in every sphere of Persian life. Particular attention has been -naid to alleged persecution of democratic elements in the army and in the Trade Unions. But all these attacks, however virulent, have been on familiar lines and represent usual Soviet tactics of turning the^heat on to any country within their zone of interest, where their own supporters are not securely in power and where there is opposition to the realisation of Soviet aims. 3. The autonomous Azerbaijan movement marks a new departure so far as Soviet propaganda here is concerned. Rarlier Soviet propaganda about Azerbaijan some weeks ago was on the rather different track of a desire on the part of the inhabitants of Persian Azerbaijan to link up with their more fortunate brothers in Soviet Azerbaijan. This line was only touched upon and never developed. It looks as though the Soviet authorities are now lallmg back upon the less obvious, but in the long run eoually effective, tactics of first weakening still further the links between Tabriz and Tehran. The next step would then be to advocate the union of all Azerbaijanians within one state. This could of course only be within the Azerbaijanian-ooviet Republic. 4. There would probably be advantage in exposin'- the full implicatio ns of this latest move (e.g. by suitable rufcli&amp;ty) before the Soviet authorities commit themselves too far in its support.

More moderate leaders of Tudeh Party in a recent talk with a member of the Embassy described present situation in this country as intolerable and expressed the view that no reform could be achieved until Persia’s foreign policy i.e. her relations with Britain and Russia and Anglo-Russian relations in Persia were clarified. He declared that hia extremists desired good relations with both countries but would oppose undue influence by either. Mhile accusing us of supporting the present corrupt ruling class and thereby perpetuating the existing situation he denied that his party wanted a revolution or that the people were ready for a revolution. 2. In his opinion the situation demanded a coalition government of all elements except perhaps the most extreme 'reactionary' elements of Zia and until the standard of education of the people was raised, a kind of 'directed' democracy to take the place of true democracy. 3. In answer to a question about the composition of the Tudeh party he admitted the existence of corrupt elements who sought to use Russian support for their personal ends but asserted that the party if it came to power would turn them out. 4. Three prominent Tudeh leaders also recently approached the Persian Prime Minister and proposed to him that he should persuade Doctor Taheri, one of the leaders of the pro-Government majority [2 gps. undec: ?in power] to join forces with Tudeh and bring his followers with him in return for which Tudeh promised Sadr to see that Russia quickly evacuated north Persia altogether. 5. Dr. Taheri's reaction to this was that it indicated that Tudeh felt they were losing ground. This may well be so at the moment.

[CYPHER] The attitude of the Soviet military authorities in the north is causing increasing anxiety. Official Persian protest referred to in my telegram No.942 says that the Soviet authorities at Gunbad not only ordered Persian gendarmerie reinforcements to return to their bases but told the local gendarmes not to open fire in any circumstances. Action of the Russians in stopping Persian gendarmes at Firuzkuh is particularly disquieting. —_In my t elegram No.912 I suggested that Soviet repudiati of the movement at Maragha and the visit of the Soviet Ambassador to Azerbaijan were perhaps signs of hesitation. Intransigeance of the Soviet military authorities in the north does not necessarily contradict this suggestion. It may merely mean that any change of policy in political circles such as is also indicated by our almost complete victory on the censorship question may not have penetrated to the Soviet military authorities who therefore continue in true Soviet fashion to stop everything which they are not enjoined by positive instructions to allow. Liaison between the political and military sides may be even slower than usual because the Soviet Ambassador has left apparently for Moscow without naming any member of his staff as Charge d* Affaires, all counsellors have disappeared and no one can be found in the Soviet Embassy except a Secretary who indicates with unusual appearance of truth that he does not know anything about anything.

The courage of the Persian Government in giving to press official information of protests against the Soviet action and appearance of information in some newspapers •which have hitherto omitted anything likely to offend the Russians is due in part no doubt to the fact that the •evacuation of the whole'of Persia is now only a matter of months, but mainly, I think, -to the abolition of the censorship on press telegrams which gives the / Persian Government some means of defence against the partial and scurrilous reports of TASS.'

As to their policies, their published political programmes are usually almost indistinguishable one from another and have in any case very little political significance. The programme of the ’’National Will' 1 Party (No*43) has already been sent to you under cover of my despatch to the Foreign Office, No.69 of the 7th March, and a copy of the progranrue of the Tudeh Party for the 14th Majlis, together with a memorandum upon it, both of which were sent to the Foreign Office and to His Majesty’s Hmbassy in Moscow under cover of my despatch No.106 of the 7th Max’ch, 1944, is enclosed herein. A conraentary upon the proceedings of the first General Conference of the party was forwarded to you under cover of my despatch No.376 of 26th August, 1944 to the Foreign Office. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient Servant, (Sgd.) R.G. MONYPJSNNY. Charge d’Affaires. His Excellency the Governor-General of’ India, External Affairs Department, NSW DELHI.SECRi © ^C ONFIDENTIAL A NOTE ON POLTICIAL PARTIES AND IN PERSIA. jl r rANISATIONS '7 i TUDBH (Hizb-i-Tudeh-i-Iran); This has been the subject of numerou^ memoranda divers sources, and only the briefest ni*W&amp;' ar^-©giv^^here. 0-&amp;an is the daily 'Rahbar', edited by IRAJ ISKANDARI, who also represents the party in the Majlis. Other Tudeh Deputies are: Dr. Kishavarz, Radmanish, Fidakar, Parvin Gunabadi, Shahhab Firdausi, Karabakhsh, Hovhanassian. The manifestoes and ^.programmes published by the party at various times seem to breathe nothing but a spirit of enlightened reform; and are certainly more definite and coherent than those of other parties. Neverthe less, the party is sponsored and financed by the Soviet authorities, and employs gangster methods to increase its influence, notably among the textile workers in Isfahan and in the Russian-occupied zones of Azarbaijan, Mazandaran and Khurasan. In the north-west in particular, it actively sponsors a Kurdish separatist movement (efforts are being made to initiate a similar movement among the Armenians of Isfahan) and is working for the separation of Azarbaijan from Persia. In August.1944 it held its first general conference in Tehran, when 170 delegates attended, mostly from the ^ northern provinces. Isfahan sent 7 . A 'regional conference' was held in Tabriz in January 1945. The party also sponsors a Labour Union (of which 'ZAFAR' is the organ) with branches and subsidiaries all over Persia. Provincial committees of the party are recorded in the following places: Amul, Arak (Sultanabad), Arsbaran, Ardabil, Babul, Babulsar, Bihshahr, Jam, Damghan, Isfahan, Khavar, Khuy, Khumain, Khunsar, Khuzistan, Mamaqan, Mashhad, Mazandaran, Mianduab, Miane, Mishkin- shahr, Nahavand, Pahlavi, Qum, Rasht, Riza’iya, Sapid Dasht, Sarab, Sari, Shahi, Shahpur, Shazand, Tabriz, Zinjan, Zirab, Simnan, Khurasan, Tehran, Bushihr, Dizful, Kajire, Pul-i-Safid, Ahwaz, Maragha, Sadiqan, Birjand, Gifan, Ardakan, Buluk-i-Zahra, Shiraz, Ramadan. In Isfahan the party may be said for the moment to have suffered complete defeat, and would be extinguished there but for the open support of the Soviet Consulate. In Azarbaijan, on the other hand, it has completely paralysed the- local government and virtually taken over its functions. There is also a branch in Kirmanshah where the party recently tried on the engineering of a strike among K.P.C. workers. The Company stood firm, upon which the Central Tudeh authorities disowned the strikers. JUSTICE Party (Hizb-i-Adalat): Organ is H NIDA-yi-ADALAT' which superseded the paper 'BAHRAM' in May 1944. The party was founded in early summer 1942 by ALI DASHTI, at present a deputy for Tehran, who was at one time declared certifiably insane. Among its early members were Farajullah Bahrami (formei^-Governor General of Isfahan), Majid Muvaqqar (whose paper Mihr-i-Iran, was for some time the party organ) Riza Hikmat and Ibrahim Khaje Nuri (who was made secretary of the party). ^ It has the usual vague programme of reform, but is in &gt; effect simply an employment agency; Dashti makes trouble in the X Majlis if party members are not given jobs, promotions, commodities and the like. Its .membership is consequently unstable. Its representatives in the Majlis are Dashti, Husain Tihrani and Jamal ud Din Imami. It held an annual general meeting in October 1944. Its Kirmanshah branch is at one with the mullas in working for a revival of religious feeling, a tactic which they pursue out of opposition to the Tudeh. A group of 'Islah Talaban' (i.e. 'Reformists') in Malayir also calls itself ADALAT, but has no connection with the party. 3. FREEDOM LOVERS ’ Party (Hizb-i-Azadikhahan): Not heard of before June 1944, when it announced its fusion with the Paikar, Mihan Parastan and Istiqlal parties to form the Mihan Party. A party of the same name existed in Tabriz in 1943, led by the old Liberal agitator Sartipzade. It was supported by the newspaper SAHAND. 4 t /13./ FREEMENS * Party (Hizb-i-Azadigan) : branch of No. 41 ^ Opened a local branch in Ahwaz in November 1942, and in December of that year attempted to collect and destroy copies of classical poets and religious commentaries. It was led by one Muhammad Ali Imam and its object seemed to be a Morrisian socialism of extreme innocuousness. 5. PERSIAN FREEDOM Party (Hizb-i-Azadi-yi-Iran): ^ Pounded by Ahmad Mihbud, a member of the Foreign Ministry and at ^resent Second Secretary in Washington, in the autumn of 1941. He was probably the sole member, but he published a programme in February 1943. 6 - AWAKENING Party (Hizb-i-Bidari): Affiliated' to the Vatan party and active in Yazd. Came into being shortly before the 1943 elections. Directed by Said Jalil Jalili and his son Mahmid. Aim appears to be the safeguarding of the position of Dr. Tahiri and of Jalali as deputies, and to counteract the influence of the Ittifaq. party (No.19). 7. NATIONAL DEFENCE Party (Hizb-i-Dafa’~i~Milli): Formed in Mashhad at the beginning of 1942, when it worked against the British and the Russians in Khurasan, Members were all reported to have pro-German views, and membership was restricted to persons who worked for the Germans before the invasion. One of its objects was to impede the Russians in collecting rifles left by the fleeing Persian army. 8 . DEMOCRATIC Party (Hizb-i-Demokrat): Existed during the 1914-1918 war, when its members included local landlords, notables and gendarmerie officers. Had contact with Wassmuss, opposed Qawam ul Mulk (with whom, however, it is now playing ball) and was generally anti-British and pro-German. It disappeared with the advent of the SPR. The party was revived in Shiraz in July 1944, represents the interests of the bazar and is backed by local landlords. Branches are reported in Abade, Istahbanat and Kazirun. It runs three newspapers and a reading-room in Shiraz. • The Hizb-i-Husaini is a religious offshoot of it (see No.12). The deputies Mihdi Namazi,and Mu’Addil are members. 9. VOLUNTEERS.”’ Party (Hizb-i-Fida* iyan): (Name strictly means ”Those who make . sacrifices”). Issued a manifesto in a supplement to the paper ”NIJAT-i-IRAN” in August 1943, calling on Persians to ”cleans a the stain of Shahrivar and stand up for the rights of Persia”. It has not been heard of since. Probably the same as No.42. FIRUZ Party (Hizb-i-Fi ruz): In November 1944 a letter from Fasa to ”NIJAT-i-IRAN” said that a party under this name had been formed there. The paper protested against the use of the name. 11. COMPANIONS * Party (Hizb-i-Hamrahan): Founded by Mustafa Fatih (an Anglo-Iranian Oil Company employee) November 1942, Among its early members was Nasrullah Jahangir, Deputy Governor of the National Bank. It produced a ’’shadow cabinet” in the same year; but it seems to have declined from prominence since the 14th Majlis came into being: in fact it has virtually ceased to exist, except insofar as Sasan Khaje-Nasiri represents it in the Majlis. HUSAIN Party (Hizb-i-Husaini): J (See also No* 8 ). A report in 1942 from Yazd stated it to be an organisation for spreading anti-British propaganda, and to maintain that by ”abjad” reckoning the letters in Hitler’s name proved that he was the Mahdi. The party was a darvish circle, of which the head was called Dhu’r-Riyasatain (Possessor of two Headships); it had branches, called Khanqa or Khane-i-Qan, all over the country. It failed,to attract the merchant class, and seems to have died.13* JUST Party (Hizb-i-Iiadgustaran) ; i Formed in Mashhad in November 1943{ by M^h^rtmad Sayjadi, who at first wanted to call it the Intiqam (vengeSTCe*;'^partyv-- He published a paper called M Dadgustari n ? but both it and the party petered out from lack of funda. Its policy wao unexceptionable from the^llied point of view. 14. PERSIA Party (Hizb-i-Iran); Formed in Shiraz July 1944. Nothing further has been heard of it. 15. P ERSI A Party (Kizb-i-Iran) $ Also known as Kizb-i-Shafaq (shafaq means pity or twilight). Formed in June 1944 by deputies Farivar, Mu'azzami, Zangane and Mu’avin. In the Majlis it functions as the Azadi (freedom) group and aims at establishing a miadle block between the Tudeh and the ’'capitalists’ 1 . Organ is ’’Shafaq”, 16. FREE P ERSIA Party (Hizb-i-Iran-i-Azad)s An unimportant party formed at Tabriz in May 1944 by Isma^il Iqdam, a supporter of Sayyid Zia, 17. A WAKENED PERSIA Party (Hizb-i-Iran-i-Bidar); Formed by Husain Quli Katibi, editor of the Tabriz paper 'Faryad”, which is the organ of the party. Has little influence and consists largely of professional men, some of whom were educated in Germany. Before the Allied victory it was strongly pro-German and was trying to obtain popular support by pretending to represent the people. Its attitude became conciliatory by October 1944, and by January 1945 it seemed to have died. The party was mentioned in the MAYR documents, and hence Katibi experienced Russian opposition (which seems to have been withdrawn, as Faryad is now the chief Tudeh organ in Tabriz). 13. IN DEPENDENC E Party (Hizb-i-Istiqlal)s Organ is u Azad”, Founded in 1944 by Abdul Qadir Azad, but got few members. Allied itself with the Mihan Parastan in April 1944, and with the Paikar and Azadikhahan parties in June 1944 to form the Mihan party. 19. UNION Party (Hizb-i-Ittifaq)s Formed in April 1944 in Yazd by Muhammad and Kazim Harati. Its only object seems to be to keep Qasim Harati out of the picture - a family affair of no political importance. (Dee also No. 6 ). 20. YOUTH Party (Hizb-i-Javanan )2 Foiled in Ahwaz in June 1945 by Nadiri, Ali qannadi and Dr. Mu’azid. 21. YOU T H AND ENLIGHTENMENT (Hizb-i-Javanan-i-^aushanfikr): More properly ’’Enlightened Youths”. Formed in Tabriz in June 1944 and supposed to be connected with a ’’greater Azarbaijan” movement. 22. WO RK Party (Hizb-i-Kar)i Organ is 'Pand”, in which it published its programme in August 1944, a programme in most points similar to that of any other party. It advocated, however, women’s suffrage, conscription for purposes other than purely military, and was opposed to the conferring of administrative and legislative powers on foreign advisers. Founder was Musharraf Nafisi. It half-heartedly opposed the Russian claims to an oil concession in November 1944. /23. PEOPLE'S23. P EOPLE 1 S Party (Hizb-i-Mardum)s Formed by Sayyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabataba'i, speaker of the Majlis, in August 1944 # Its programme is unexceptional, except for the professed aim of ' , 'susyalizm M , which seems Trori the context to hav^no connection with the generally accepted meanings of socialism. The manifesto contained the names of three ministers, Ardalan, Zand and Bayat, of seventeen deputies, and some l 6 o officials, landowners V and professional men. Party appears to have formed round the * National Union (Ittifaq-i-Milli) group in the Majlis, most of whose members are in the party. It also appears to be keeping an eye on the Court, since Zand is a Shah’s man. Few of the names in the list were worthy of any respect and the party never looked like -being progressive in any sense. In Isfahan it was sponsored by the Dsulatabadi cousins. The organ is Nida-yi-Millat. (See also No.26). 24. FAT NEKLxUTD Party (Hizb-i-Mihan) % Formed in June 1944 by the fusion of the Mihen Paras ten, Paikar, Istiqlal and Azadikhahan parties. Organ is n Iran-i~Ma n , later ’’Hastakhiz” (though Iran-i-Ma still carried party notices). X Some of the members have given out that they have British support, to counter the Russian backing of the Tudeh. But 'Iran-i-Ma” and 'Rastakhiz” are by no means anti-Russian papers. There is a branch in Ahwaz and the party is active among railway employees. 25- PATR IOTS ’ Party (Hizb-i-Mihan Parastan)s Became fused in Mihan Party in June 1944. Organ was “Mihan Parastan', which still exists. The party used the symool of two interlaced circles. The programme was an ambitious one. In its early days the party tried vaguely to organise youth against the Tudehj it also had a strong anti-^lly tinge. At one time (1943) it was thought to be receiving money from the Court. Has connections with Lur Tribes, especially the Papi. The “Guruh-i-Msrd-i-Kar'' is allied to it. (No. 35). 26. NA TIONAL Party (Hizb-i-Millat )1 In June 1943 consisted of Muhammad Sadiq Tabataba’i, Dr. Husain Marzban, and one or two others of less importance. Their programme resembled any other; they had litole hope of the Shah, whom they considered wrongly brought up, but both the leaders mentioned are servile to the Shah. See also 23. 27. Party of the MILLION (Hizb-i-Milliun); . Formed by Husain Lankurani out of the “U“ party, which supported the Shah (June 1942). Khalisizade and Muvarrikn ud Daula Sipihr were members at the time. Not much was heard of it after this. In August 19459 however, Didaban, its organ, came out with a manifesto and programme, which included, among the usual items, provision for physical training, strengthening of the armed forces, and protection of archaeological and literary monuments. In 1943 Adil Khal’atbari announced that he had been elected president of a party of this name, but it may have been a different one. Anyway it was not heard of again. 28. Party of the MUSLIM MILLION (Hizb-i-Milliun-i-Islami); Started in burujird summer 1943 and then said to have two to three thousand followers. became quite influential under leader ship of Abu Turab Razani and Siqat ul Islami; but has not been heard of since. (See also No.4o). 29 . BATTLE Party (Kizb-i-Paikar)s Founded in 1942. Leading lights included Zahir ul Islam,* &lt; f + i , ■- i ! m . &gt; - ; Javad Imami, Khusrau Iqbals Fused with Mihan Parastan, 1944 to fom Ivlihan party. ^nti-Tudeh; ant j-Allyjjq.^tionilist. Istiqlal and June 30^ PE RSIAN SOCIALIST Party (Hizb-i-Susiyalist-i-Irsn) s Founded in March 1944 by disgruntled members of the Hamrahan partys Shahidzade, Abbas Naraqi, Bani Sadr, Humayuni, Faryar, Mu* azzami. Joined in December 1944 by the Jami 1 at-i-Pishravan (‘‘Progressives* Society* 1 ). Organ is * , Imruz va Tarda**. 31 % N ATIOhViL UNITY Party (Hizbri-Vahdat-i-MUli) s Little is known of this party. Its organ is 'Salahshur 1 ’. 32. FnTl^RL^ND Party (Hizb-i-Vatan); Organ is “Sada-yi-Vatan”. The party is, or was (it has not been heard of lately) run by Asadullah Rashidi in Isfahan. The idea is that it should be eventually absorbed in Sayyid Zia’s ’’National V/ill” party. Perhaps it has been. (See No.43). There is also a branch in Sari, and perhaps elsewhere. 33. WOMEN’S Party (Hizb-i-Zanan)s Presumably not the same as the Jami * a t-i-Za nan (women’s Society). The party is led by Fatima Sayyah and has Russian backing. A branch was formed in Shiraz by Safiya Firuz (wife of General Firuz, Governor General of Furs) in September 1944 $ from which Baha’is were explicitly excluded. . The party wrote officially to the Embassy in September 1944, over the signature of Mrs. Sayyah, requesting travel facilities for Mrs. Firuz, as a member of the party secretariat, to go to the United Kingdom and the U. S. A. as their official representative. 34. WOMEN’ S Society (Jami’at-i-Zanan)s Arose in 1944. Sponsored chiefly by Mrs. Mihri Sabri, whose husband keeps .a cloth-shop in Tehran. Ke has reputation of Soviet sympathies, and this party seems to share them. Another organiser is Mrs. Shirmani, head of the municipal Orphans’ School. 35* WORKERS’ Group (Guruh-i-Mard-i-Kar )1 Organ is ”Mardan-i-Ksr”. Reported in June 1942 to be in coalition with Mihan Parastan, Paikar and Istiqlal parties. Not heard of since. (See No. 25). 3^. Y OUNG PERSIA NS’ Society (Jami 1 at-i-Javanan-i-Iran)s Led*~apparently by one Mustafa Aliabadi. Has connections with the Shah. First appearance (in press) July 1943? 'hut not heard of since, 37. Society of PROG RESSIV ES (Jami’at-i-Pishravan); (See No.30). 3?. ANTI-FASCIST Society (Jami’at-i-Zidd-i-Fashist )2 Has not been heard of for a long time. 39 . Society of VICTIMS* (Jami’at-i-Sitamdidigan): Led by ithmad Shariq. Not heard of since June 1944 # It is not clear what Ahmad was a victim of. .40. K IRMANSHAH LOCAL Society (Jami* at-i-Mahalli-yi-Kirmanshah) s Fomed chiefly to influence elections in 1943. Uncharitable critics say its adherents were chiefly hooligans bent on creating minor local disturbances. Opposed to, but hardly distinguishable from, /Ad ala t.Adalat. (No.2) a Led by Muhsif and Karimi. 41. Society of FREEMEN (Jami’at-i-Azadigan) of Shiraz; ^ Started about the beginning of ^pril 1944 by Muhammad Bahari and *bdur Rasul Parvizi. Also connected with this group are Mubashshiri of Isfahan (who 9 with the Tudeh, may be financing it) and Pazargad, editor of Khurshid-i-Iran, a (at least formerly) anti- British paper but a member of the anti-Soviet Independence Front. Bahari and Parvizi have communist views and are said to have been associated with two other reputed communists, Muhammadian and Tavalluli, in fomenting a strike in the two textile mills in Shiraz. According to M Rahber M (February 1944) the managing committee consists of; Pazargad, Muhammad Taqi Mu'ayyad, Parvizi, Farhun Tavazzuli, Iraj Zandpur, Turab Basiri*, Muhammad Tahri. They complained of government interference in the Fars elections for the 14th Majlis. 41 A. Society of FREE MEN (Jami'at-i-^zadigan)s Distinct from the preceding. Leader is Kasravi, a mad Azarbaijani who sets himself up as a religious leader or, according to his opponents, a prophet. Ke supports in theory religious toleration and free thought,, but his practice seems confined to burning the classics and works of mystical poets such as Hafiz. This is probably (see No.4) the same party as started in to burn sacred books in Tabriz and Ahwaz. Kasravi used to edit the newspaper Parcham, and was in 1941-42 known to be anti-Russian. Kis party has a branch in nbadan. In July 1945 the Embassy received a letter fron one Husain Yazdanian on behalf of the society, enclosing a pamphlet called 'Dar Rah-i-Siyasat M , advocating an apparently harmless policy of good-neighbourliness and mild socialistic reform. 42. AZ JAN GUZASH TIGnN Party; (See No. 9 ) Organ is '’Nahang’ 1 . In July 1944 it was reported that this party was a terrorist branch of the Tudeh, its leaders being the Lankurani brothers, and various others, including formerly Shahande, editor of ’’Farman”. 43. NnTIQNuL WILL Party (Hizb-i-Irade-i-Milli)s Formed by Sayyid Zia ud Din. Published its aims in u Tufan-i- Sharq’ 1 in ^pril 194 5 . After the Sayyid‘s return to Persia in 19^3? the formation of a series of cells (khalqas) was reported, consisting of ten men, each of whom would start a secondary cell of ten. In June 1944 it was reported that there were in Tehran 94 primary and about 700 secondary cells, giving the party a strength of some 7000. Membership was largely recruited from the Vatan party (No. 32 ). In August 194$ about SJ members were reported from Isfahan, and there are cells in many provincial towns, as well asaclub and regular meetings in Tehran. Membership probably largely recruited from No.32. 44 . S UFFERERS * Party (Hizb-i-Ranjbar)s Split off from the Tudeh in 1942, to fcim an*underground and extremist party, with revolution as its aim. Was finding its most premising material among students. . Only oral propaganda was made. The party was not anti-Ally. It has net been heard of since October 1942. 4 5 .

UNITED NATIONAL FRO NT (Jabhe-i-Vahid-i-Milli); Wrote a letter to u Sitara n in Augusu 1943) addressed to the British Minister with copies to the Russian and American representatiJie-s^ desiring good understanding with the British. 51. AZARBAIJAN LIBERALS; Apparently consisted (1943) of Aqazade, Sartipzade and Astana 1 i- in fact the then Tabriz Tudeh Committee! They signed a message in February 1943 intended for Mr. Churchill - obviously using the Allied victory to further their own political a Ins, especially recruitment for the Tudeh. 52. AZARBAIJ^N ANTI-FASCIST Party. Proclaimed itself in 1943? perhaps the same as No. 51 . Led by one Isfahani (not the deputy). Joined hands with Iran-i-Bidar, with the Tudeh workers’ union ana with the so-called 'liberal party'. Common ground was dislike of the Governor General, General Muqaddam. F REE TIEN of PERSIA Party (Ahrar-i-Iran) s Published its aims in 'Alam' in March 1945* Nothing out standing about them, and nothing else is known of the party 5 if indeed it exists.

The party derived funds and support from the Court. In April 1944- Ra’d-i-Imruz (anti-Tudeh paper) reported that officers were meeting in Tehran and taking secret oaths; and that the party haa been trying to get a candidate into the Majlis for Saqqiz (this seems to connect the party with No. (Hizb-i-Nahzat- i-Milli), as Muhit is deputy for Saqqig).[SiM CLAIR] GLLERaL distribution FRQv; JViOSCOV; TO ICREIGN OFFICE Mr* Roberts.

I realise difficulty of getting Russians to leave the country altogether before they must, but I very much hope that attempt will be made. 2. Course (1) is I suggest excluded by political situation as a first line of approach to Russians. It is tantamount to saying publicly that, ex?ept in regard to Tehran concession already announced (and itsnouia oe remembered that occupation of Tehran which is well , outside of British and Russian zones was never formally agreed by Persian Government) the Allies regard themselves as free to profit to the utmost by [grp. undec.J of the Treaty, and will remain in large areas of Persia long after iy excuse remains for so doing that public could ^, derstand. This would have profoundly discouraging effect . - . . • j T _ 4- -! •jitrrMT in an un )ulation, and woulc on overwhelming majority of popu^u.™, correspondingly encourage Tuden mischief makers. It woul suit the Russians admirably since they would be tree to effect last minute evacuation. Having land lines oi communication and no installations of importance they can without the slightest difficulty withdraw at the eleventh hour. 3. While this Embassy in accordance with instructions / contained in paragraph 2 of your telegram N o. 455 has been 3&amp;&amp;U careful to say nothing to the Persians about the prospect ^ of discussion by the Council of Foreign Ministers of &gt;further stages of evacuation, it would appear that no jAcuH** &gt; such dis£e&amp;ancy was enjoined on my Soviet and American ^ colleaguesbotn of whom mentioned the prospect to the BECo^WL DlH. p f rsia 5 55 AUG 1945 I INDIA OFFICE!~ 2 - Persian Government. Persians have' been quirk to note a §ood deal of disrepancy and if the result of the Councils aeliberations turns out as disappointingly negative as cpurse ( 1 ), conclusion might well he drawn (with or without Russian prompting) that it was we who had all along been putting on the brake. When announcing to the Tj minister for Foreign Affairs intention of Soviet forces to evacuate ovogyewc, Soviet Ambassador after claiming that there were hardly any Soviet forces to remove said it was regrettable that the capital had ever been occupied: Soviet authorities had brought in some troops to protect Stalin at the Conference and finding British troops here had left their own. It is true - unfortunately - that we first brought troops to Tehran and then in a fit of absence of mind added area Headquarters. 4. As to course (2) can we not at least propose to Russians a total pari passu withdrawal in much less than six months? The British troops were anyhow to evacuate the summer camps by November 1st and they will no longer be needed for projection of oil area as a wartime interest; peacetime risks i.e. labour and tribal unrest we must anyhow race before long without assistance of British troops, though to reduce those risks to a minimum His majesty’s Embassy are about to invite Persian Government to discuss special security measures for that area 0 As regards ? rotection of air communications for return of trqops from he Far East, v/e can no longer deny the Persian right to insist on providing for a guard for us. 5. The only delaying factors are thus physical difficulties, transport and disposal of assets. A delay of six months is surely much too long for surmounting these in view of political issues at stake. 6 . I had much hoped tfiat’we could inform the Russians of our readiness to effect total withdrawal from the vicinity by about December 12th, i.e. date an which Persian general elections are due to be held or at least soon after. For reasons given in paragraph 5 above. Russians cannot pretend to avert physical or administrative difficulties [grp. undec.] their going as soon. If they reject the proposals merely on the ground that they ought to 'see no reason to hurry' we can at least ensure (as I have frequently urged) that it should be generally known to Persia and the world In general that the blame for delay does not lie with us. Persistent press commentaries enquring just why Russians are so anxious to remain in an independent and Allied country till last possible moment would at least hamper the Russian schemes for completing their Persian haymaking before the treaty sun sets. Public is beginning to show up their activities in other countries - countries which through having been on the wrong side have far.less claim to general sympathy - and it undoubtedly cramps their style. In this connexion please see my telegram No. 8 d 1 about censorship, which remains one of the principal keys to the whole problem (your telegram No. 529 now * v received). 7.4 &gt; 64 7. On a point of detail, the last sentence of your paragraph 2 overlooks that Kermanshah camp is really at Bisitun outside our 'zone” and would therefore have to be evacuated as well as QUM Ramadan and Sultanabad* For reaons given above however merely to withdraw to our respective zones as an intermediate stage would be hardly better than course ( 1 ).

You are well aware of the methods which they are employing. They have paralysed the Persian administration in the north where they also encourage a Kurdish nationalist movement and allow no political party but Tudeh to exist. They fill the works with Tass propaganda about Persia but use censorship to suppress objective news from other sources. They seem likely to succeed in their attempt to control Radio Tehran. All this is part of the attempt to [grp. undec. ? rig] the elections in favour of Tudeh so that the new Majlis may be subservient to Soviet policy. (Since the last paragraph was drafted two disturbing incidents which I have reported in separate telegram have come to my knowledge: mutiny at Meshed and attempt by Tudeh to seize administration at Maragha). [?£ c ( r 2. Persian poll [? grp, omitted] provides for general elections every two years and elections which drag on for weeks must take place during the three months approximately December 12th to March 11th next. Under the treaty the last Soviet troops need not leave Persia until presumably about the end of February, i.e. 6 months after signature of armistice with Japan and unless substantial reduction in the area occupied by Soviet forces is effected very soon elections in the north vail be run by the Russians. There is good evidence that Russians in exchange for a written promise to follow Soviet instructions thereafter are offering to secure election of people of importance by northern constituencies without the bother of an electoral campaign. 3. It might seem that [grp, undec,] the thing to do would be to/to postpone the elections for a few months but at any hint of this Tudeh declares that in that case they will hold the elections themselves. Holding of such elections could not be prevented in the north and successful candidates may form provincial councils and pass-embarrassing ''legislation 11 and enforce it by such means as are now being usdd’in Azerbaijan to encourage refusal to pay rural rents. Extent of Russian help would depend upon known Soviet estimate of how far-they could safely go. A* Tudeh justify their demand that elections should take place before departure of foreign.troops on the pretext that otherwise Persia will revert to the state she was in under Reza Shah when (they allege) she was entirely under the. influence of imperialists, i.e. of His Majesty's Government. Knowing that Reza Shah ms rather less amenable than a rogue elephant we may think this theoretically absurd but since many Persians used to hold it as a sub-conscious excuse for tame submission to the Shah’s despotic rule it serves as a good cover behind which to work for a Tudeh dictatorship, backed by the Russians. Incidentally it was entertaining to see with what fervour Tudeh newspapers greeted Professor Laski's speech against the puppet government, 5. Published programme of Tudeh is reasonable - although' not more reasonable nor appreciably more radical than those of several .(Other parties who, lacking foreign advice and discipline., make less noise in Persia. On the other hand successive Persian Governments of last four years whom on my own initiative or on your instructions I have urged to carry out reforms have made most meagre response. Their excuse has been lack of necessary authority owing to foreign occupation and particularly to Russian interference. This excuse is at least partly valid: Russians, e.g. by their relentless sabotage of work of American advisers have shown that they greatly prefer continuation of what might be [grp. undec.] to any programme of gradual reform. I do not however contend that any conceivable Persian Government . would be thoroughly enlightened nor that erections held after departure of foreign troops would be entirely democratic 0 As in England 150 years ago great bulk of Persian electorate is inert ,' does' not expect much say in its own governance and would use power rather wildly if it got it. I believe however that outside Russian controlled area, w r here anti-Tudeh opinion is discouraged,;dislike of Tudeh as a foreign-controlled organisation is widespread and I do therefore contend that if Russian armed support for Tudeh were reduced elections would be a great deal fairer than if it were not. Tudeh demand that elections should not await departure of foreign troops is by way of a handsome tribute to impartiality which could be expected from our troops and a damaging admission about the Russians. 6 . The Russian's objection to Reza Shah regime may rest partly/4151 I 945 partly on ideological hostility to all despots but their own bat I am convinced that they hated it mostly because be would not allow foreign propaganda. They are now determined to dominate Persia through the Tudeh Party which they openly support. Success of such a policy would mean the end of a national existence which in spite of periods of eclipse has maintained itself for over 2,000 years. It would also I believe mean the end of British interests in Persia and hence the undermining of our whole position throughout the Middle East. help but when can we expect that? If Allied troops could be out of the country by December 12th the elections would be fairly free from foreign influence but only the strongest pressure will induce the Russians to leave so promptly.

But his Cabinet ( received no majority in the Mejlis ! | and on June 3 had to resign in its * turn. On June 12 a new Cabinet i was formed by Sadr but this Cabi- j net. too, has so far obtained no confirmation and a fierce political 1 struggle is raging round it, writes S.

The immediate cause of the Gov ernment crisis in Iran lies in the fact that, reactionary elements, •£; PEOPLE’S PARTY The largest and the most organi zed democratic mass party of Iran is the People's Party, founded in 1941 by the late Suleiman Mirza, : one of the oldest and the most prominent leader of the national democratic movement in Iran. The People’s Party represents interests of the popular masses, workers, peasants, artisans and the working intelligentsia. It champions the formation of a democratic Govern- * Tui4 daUd iqjjjltr forms t gressive ment i; Iheaded by the notorious adventu-, rer, Seid Ziyaed Din, have become more active l-lian ever, 'ihese ele ments want a Government which will act more resolutely against de- I veloping a democratic movement in the country and inaugurate a fo- * reign policy in line with the in terest of reaction. After the collapse of the Pro fascist policy of Reza Shah and his abdication in favour of his son. Mohammed Reza Shah in 1941, no essential changes have taken place in the social and economic system of Iran. To this day no, democra tic reforms have been introduced to secure favourable conditions for the country’s development and im prove conditions of the broad sec- pie’s P pendent enforcement of re the country’s pro-1 ent and improve-f dition of large sec- wpulation. The Peo- 0 favours an inde- ‘gn policy and radical ^ majority of peasants still owns no l ■uq land and has to rent it from land lords on exorbitant terms. To this day no law has been passed to al leviate the condition of the working people who are vic tims of inhuman exploitation Nor has electoral reform been carried out. The school system remains un changed. Many of the officials who enforced Reza Shah’s despotic re gime still hold Government posts and pursue their old policies. No beginning has even been made to effect a judicial reform and courts, which are harsh in regard to de mocratic elements, are- very gentle when they deal with reactionary leaders. However, the fall of Reza t Shah’s despotic power created cer-1 tain opportunities for the develop- * 1 * * * ment of the democratic movements. The democratic movement in Iran is represented by several poli tical parties tthe People’s Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the “Iran” Party and others) as well as by a number of trade unions and the “Freedom Front” the coalition of democratic news papers and progressive elements in Teheran and other cities. ave deteriorated, particularly through the policy of the Sayed Government which acted in liaison with Seid Ziyaed Din and other reactionaries. As a mass party and an outspoken champion of friendly Soviet-Iranian rela tions, the People’s Party has been the object of particularly vicious attacks from reactionary elements. The “Freedom Front” also plays a big part in the development of de mocratic movement in Iran. It was formed in 1943 as a coalition of several Tehefan progressive newspapers for fight against reac tion. Today the “Freedom Front” has its organizations in many tions among the population. A j; towns. It unites not only editors of democratic newspapers put also other representatives of progressive public opinion in the ranks of the intelligentsia, officials, merchants etc. Considerable progress has been made in these years by trade unions of Iran, even though so far only a minority of workers and professionals are organized in their ranks. According to data publish ed in the Iranian press the trade unions have a membership of ever 100,000 (out of a total of 500,000 to 600,000 workers). Almost all Iranian trade unions are affiliated to the Central Trade Union Coun cil of Iran set up in 1944. The trade unions are demanding an eight-hour day. wage increases, en dorsement of the law on labour and workers’ insurance, adoption of measures against unemployment etc. RIGHT-WING MEJLIS MAJORITY Despite their broad mass base, however, the democratic organiza tions are very weakly represented in the Mejlis and they, therefore, have no opportunity to take a pro- i per Part in the administration .of ! state. As pointed out by Iranian newspapers, elections to the present the fourteenth, Mejlis, which were | held in 1943-1944, were far from 1 democratic As a result a rather large group of extreme reactionaries with Seid Ziyaed Din at their head found themselves “elected”. On the other hand, many progressive leaders, who unquestionably enjoy the confidence of the population, were not elected or, when elected were not confirmed in their rights as deputies by the right-wing ma jority of the Mejlis. With their positions in the Mejlis and in the Government machinery consolidated, reactionary elements directed by Seid Ziya, began to expand their activities against the democratic movements in Iran. The reactionaries are obviously prepar ing the ground for the establish ment of a reactionary dictatorship. In preparation for the establish ment of a reactionary dictatorship Seid’s followe rs ana other reac Aon - aries are feverishly organizing and arming the so-called “League of Southern Tribes,” the Kashkai, Bakhuar etcetera. According to a report in a Teheran newspaper, at the conference held last February leaders of the “League of Tribes” discussed the question of forming a special “Blue Army”. When the Allied troops are withdrawn, the organisers of this “army” intend to suze power and establish their dictatorship. Seid’s newspapers in Teheran and i other cities are carrying on a rapid anti-Soviet campaign. At the time thev attacked democratic organi- ■ ‘ ' - 5 S in Ispahan, slogans on walls for vongeanre against the People’s Party were interspersed j with inscriptions suen as “Death to t the Soviet Union.” At the demand of Seid’s followers - and otmlr reactionary elements m tne Mejlis, Bayat’s Government re signed on April 17. Tnat Govern ment was far from democratic but in the opinion of Seia and his fol lowers it was not 'resolute enough in its struggle against the democra tic movement, on Maxcn 12 Seid’s newspaper. Raaae Einruz ; wrote defiantly Bay at must go, so that Iran may not take a road t leading to revolution”. Under pres sure of the reactionary groups in tne Mejlis, Bayat resigned. After the resignation of Bayat’s cabinet tne Mejlis majority put forward Hakim-ul-Mulk, known in, Iran as an old democratic nationa- &gt; list. But on June 3 the Govern ment formed by Hakim-ul-Muik al so* had to resign. The newspaper Dad tnen wrote that reactionary.^ leaders of the Mejlis had hoped to take advantage of Hakim-ui-Mulk’s personal prestige to put their own r henchmen in power, but he refused to play their game and so they I made him resign. Finally, on June; 5. Seil and his followers got their! way and the formation of the Gov ernment was entrusted to Sadr. &lt;*• former Minister of Justice under Reza Shah, and one of the most notorious reactionaries in Iran. Tho. newspaper Rastakhize Iran calls him “the butcher of democratic elements”. OPPOSITION TO SADR GOVT. The entire democratic public opinion of Iran and a considerable group of the Mejlis members, be tween forty and forty-five out of 118, are resolutely opposing the cabinet formed by Sadr. Having lost hope to come to terms with the reactionary majority of the Mejlis, the opposition, on June 14. addressed an appeal to the people pointing out that the behaviour of the ma jority of the Mejlis “contradicts j the interests of the country and i may lead to grave consequences.” As result of the intensified acti- ; vity of Seid’s followers and other : reactionary elements the political situation in Iran has thus grown extremely acute. The Government crisis is becoming chronic. There is developing a state of hopelessness stagnation and anarchy in the Governmental affairs. Meanwhile, the country Is con fronted with t^e^g^’qu 5 problems of post-war ec&lt;&gt;omic development elimination of unemployment etc. These problexos cannot, of course, be solved oy an antl-democratlc Government. Even the moderate liberal Teheran newspaper Mehre Iran speaks of the inactivity and indifference of the Mejlis and the Government in regard to problems- facing the country. Everything goes to show rhat the reactionaries in Iran are growing more and more arrogant which impairs the country's internal ana international position. All this, cannot but urge the broad 'of the population, jind all ar i groups in Iren, to wage aj mined .&lt;‘rvggle again?: j.c* 1 - ‘he coun^ gr* ' ip.'-vei! nment or icr -uxracy.—ThMbBureau of Public Information.

The Iranian Government had sometime back asked them to evacuate their respective zones of occupation. They have not | done it so far. We now learn from : Reuter’s commentator on inter national affairs that “British and Soviet troops are to stay in Iran for the time being”. Russians are plainly abusing the hospi tality of the country. They are busy trying to undermine its legitimate Government. They seem inclined to do in Iran what they have already done in Poland. The pretext given for the continuance of the Red Army’s stay in Iran is preposter ous. Anti-Soviet feeling, it is alleged runs high in the country. Assuming that there is no love lost between Russia and Iran, who is to blame for it? For well over three years the Russians have been glued on to Iran, a country of appalling poverty and squalor, completely disorganizing its internal eco nomy. The influx of these unwelcomed and unwanted people was largely responsible for bread riots in Teheran and other cities not long ago. Strangely enough, the excuses that were advanced in the days before the occupation of Iran, namely, that the Iranian Gov ernment was thoroughly pro- Fascist in deeds and words, are being repeated with the same ill-concealed gusto in an attempt to justify for the continuance of occupation. The British are, however, more frank than the Russians as to their intentions. The lure of oil is too irresistable for them to quit the country. Besides they have not forgotten the old grievance against Iran, when the late Raza Khan brought the British to agree to his terms on the question of royalty on oil. Now is the time for assuaging the ancient heartache when Iran lies prostrate. Oil will some day embroil the world in another war. The fact of the matter is that both Russia and Britain have their sinful eye on Iranian oil.

The Persians hold us largely responsible for this and not without some justification, since it was with our agreement and in execution of our common aims that the Russians entered North Persia.

While one must sympathise with a young man thrust without preparation into so difficult a position, it would he dangerous to take the sentiments he expresses at their face value. It is true that he is in favour of social reform and is never weary of castigating the selfish rich, hut although he has given considerable sums to charity (nearly always out of the amount of Rials 400,000,000 whichhe lent to the Ministry of Finance), he has made no economies either in his own expenditure or in that of his extravagant family such as would suggest to his people that he is prepared 'to give until it hurts'. Again, he deplores the instability of political life, but he is himself one of the most unstable elements, changing from day to day, and frequently leading instead of trying to stem the retreat from a difficult position when a bold front seems to be called for.

DEPT. Foreign Office.Copy, (Enclosure) No* 93/45, I was invited to pay the Shah a farewell visit on.the 19th July* It lasted over two hours* He looked ill and was extremely depressed, almost weeping, about the situation in Persia - Russian aggressiveness, Persian treason, the irresponsibility of the Majlis, the complete unfitness of Persia for democratic Government (democracy, he seemed to think, had been imposed on Persia by the British because they thought Muhamnad Ali Shah was too pro-Russian), and the general decadence of the upper classes. The necessity for elementary social measures, he said, was so obvious and their accomplishment was so easy - if only there t was a stable government. The financial situation of the country was chaotic; in a few months they might not.be able to pay Government employes, and then what a chance for the Russians and the TudehJ -What would happen if 'the Russian troops did not leave Persia before the elections? There would be at least forty deputies bound to the Russians. .A block of 40 deputies in an otherwise disunited Majlis would control the Government. What answer would Stalin give if Mr. Churchill asked him what business Russian troops had in Persia now? Would he say that Russia could not afford to have a reactionary Fascist Government on her borders and that the Russian troops would stay until there was a change of rdgime? Could a Government be called Fascist that allowed a number of uninvited foreigners, posing as the guests of some unrecognised Persian organization, to have free intercourse with Persian working classes and to listen to statements made by spokesmen selected and instructed by the Russians? Were the Russians seeking only security, or were they preparing for the next war? If they sought only security how could their policy in Persia be explained? Persia could never be a danger to them. (The Shah, fortunately, does not wait for answers to his questions). He talked about his ideas for the Army of the future. He would like to have three armoured Brigades, 6 motorized Brigades, some horsed Cavalry and two Infantry Divisions; an airforce of about 100 machines; a total of 70,000 men. He hinted plainly that he would welcome assistance from us in the equipment of his armoured Brigades. The Americans were asking very high prices for equipment. He envisaged a regiment of medium tanks (he was enthusiastic about the Comet); a regiment of lighter tracked vehicles and some mechanized infantry in each armoured Brigade. The role of the Persian Army, as he saw it, was the preservation of national honour, the maintenance of internal security and delaying action in the event of Russian aggression until assistance came from Great Britain or the United Nations. He was loath to discourage the enthusiasm of Colonel Schwarzkopf, but he did not think that Persia could afford a Gendarmerie on the scale planned by him. His view was that the functions of the Gendarmerie should be those of provincial police/police. Internal security should he the responsibility of the Army, which should have internal security battalions on a lower scale of equipment than those of the active formations. There was a great waste of money in the present system of two separate forces with separate administrations and separate services.

They will presumably go to Isfahan where at present the great majority of workmen belong to a union which is opposed to Tudeh. Plan has been the leaders of the anti^Tudeh union to show courtesy to the Soviet delegates but to say that while the workers of Isfahan are willing to be associated with other genuine trade union organizations they will have nothing to do with the ludeh party. Whether performance will come off exactly as rehearsed is doubtful. 2. It seems probable that Tudeh trade unions will send representatives to Paris in September in the hope ihat administrative Committee of trade union conference will recommend the admission of applicants to membership. 3. Tudeh unions are now claiming quarter of a million members. Whole industrial population of Persia can hardly exceed about half that figure. ^nglo-Iranian Oil Company has 70,000 workmen and other assistants and private industrial organisations were recorded in 194-3 as numbering 114- with a total [gp. undec. festablistment ] of 39 (half 78) thousand employees. Number of alleged members of Tudeh trade unions may be swollen by sympathisers amongst the northern peasantry but it would be absurd to call them trade unionists m any serious sense - or the unfortunates who I unders ana are no allowed to take their weekly wash at the village bath until they produce a card of Tudeh membership. 4.

No sooner had the Persian Minister of Communications taken over the southern railway than he ordered the reinstatement of fifty-one Persians who were arrested at the request of the allies in 1945 on suspicion of being implicated in acts of sabotage.. In conversation with the Minister for Foreign affairs I expressed great surprise that at a moment when’owing to the cessation of aid to Russia thousands of railway employees must be dismissed, Ministry of Communications should wish to reinstate men suspected of sabotage whose arrest was in fact followed by a diminution in sabotage.. (I refrained from adding for fear of giving away our informant, the Persian General Manager, .that in nearly all cases the 51 were less efficient than the men they would replace)* Minister for Foreign Affairs said he agreed that action of the Ministry of Communications was improper and promised to take it up.. 2. I renewed my protest today when I saw Prime Minister as well as Minister for Foreign Affairs* Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Minister of Communications declared he had issued no such order. This is untrue, for we have irrefutable evidence that the order was issued in writing but the denial may mean that the reinstatement will at least be held up for the present* Prime Minister was reassuring. 5. I also mentioned unofficially disturbing news that four foreigners on the railway had been arrested on a charge of corruption and others including a Belgian who was formerly an officer in the British army v/ere to be arrested. One of the 51 suspects, I_had heard, was to be put into the Belgian*s place. 1 said that no one was more desirous than I that persons guilty of corruption should be punished whoever they were. I did not know whether these foreigners were guilty or not but I did know and the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs would not contradict me that corruption on an enormous scale was widespread^in Persia and that in spite of enquiries no one was ever punished.

Prime Ilinister agreed and said that’he would issue orders’to go slow.. 4, I took the opportunity to 'give friendly advice that the Persian Government should, not abuse their power as they regained it and not allow regained power to be abused. Kurds of liahabad were now defying the Persian Government under Russian protection but when the Russians withdrew from Azerbaijan worst-thing the Persian Government could do would be to rush to punish the Kurds. Then, some non-Koslem employees of the allied armies had been threatened by the Koslems of the fate they might expect when the allies had left the country. Persian Government must keep this in mind and be ready to repress any attempt to carry out such threats. Justice apart, acts ofrevenge on Persian subjects who had served the allies would arouse strong criticism in the foreign press and perhaps have more serious consequences. Persian Government should resurad their power with a full sense of the responsibility it involves. Hasty action, especially revenge or victimisation, should be avoided. 5. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign iiffairs professed to agree with me but T do hot know that this or any oilier government that is likely to' come into power will /be able when the foreign troops have left the country to hold X up the flood of envy and hatred which has been dammed back for I the last 3i years.

Whether Kermanshah should be included in the ban is being discussed. 2) Unfortunately welfare facilities for Persian labour in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are not so good that they would be convincing to the Soviet delegates who would in any case not be there to praise the A.I.O.C. Facilities for education are excellent but housing is weak and we cannot expect the Soviet delegates to take into consideration that the war has greatly increased the number of workers while reducing supplies of building material and that A.I.O.C. labour is in any case better housed than other Persians living nearby. 3) Welfare work among Persian labour is one of the questions that I intend to study when I visit Abadan late July.

(.2) Material objectionable to us has been broadcast several times recently under Soviet auspices. Two broadcasts mentioned in paragraph 7 of my telegram 691, copies of which were sent to Baxter in my letter of July 12th, seem to have been given by Soviet Embassy whereas offensive Pravda article which caused the suspension of foreign broadcasts was given by Voks. I am informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Soviet Ambassador after alleging falsely that script to which Persian Director of Propaganda took exception had been censored, admitted that broadcast of material by Russians attacking either Persian Government or some foreign Government might cause the Minister for Foreign Affairs embarrassment and promised to give instructions to prevent any such untoward event in future. He suggested that since the Tripartite treaty places all means of communications at the disposal of the Allies he would be justified in having^ broadcast station seized by Soviet troops and in establishing a Soviet censor there. It may have been this that camsed the Persian Government to allow foreign broadcasts to resume subject to censor. V/e cannot trust the Persian censor to protect our interests so I have informed the Ministry • of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Embassy object to broadcasting material about British affairs from Radio Tehran under the auspices of any other foreign mission and I ha-ve informed my Soviet colleague in writing that I have done so.

We agree that political censorship should now be abolished.

Censorship authorities would be satisfied with the re-definition of paragraph 5 to cover the condemnation of: (1) Any communication which is suspected of being to or from an enemy agent. (2) Any communication which conveys information concerning the deployment of troops or supplies in the prosecution of the war against Japan, the movements of Allied shipping and the output of petroleum or other strategic products in Persia. This re-definition would give the Soviet Section of the Censorship much less scope for the misuse of the Censorship rules for political purposes than does the present paragraph 5. 3, From the point of view of tactics, it might be best if the initiative came from the Persian Government, in the form of a request to the British and Soviet Embassies that censorship should henceforth be confined to matters directly affecting military operations against Japan. On receipt of the Persian request, you would then be able to inform the Soviet Embassy forthwith that we agree to a modification of the censorship rules on the lines set out in paragraph 2 above. Nature of your re ply to the Soviet Embassy would no doubt become known to the Persian Government. Russians, who have no military justification for continued exercise of censorship powers, would have to accept our proposal, or face the risk of being shown up as holding on to powers for which they can show no justification.4. I should be grateful for your views whether the proposed formula is likely to achieve the end ye have in view, ana on the procedure outlined in my immediately preceding paragraph. 5.

Soviet broadcast in Persian from Radio Tehran which was cut off by Persian authorities was being given with typical cynicism in time allotted to Volis for Persian-Soviet Cultural Society. Insulting article from Pravda had been concluded before Director of Propaganda could reach the station but he cut everything short and broadcast the explanation that he had been compelled to take this action because Soviet broadcast not for the first time, was not in accordance with Tripartite Treaty. This unexpectedly courageous action by Director of Propaganda has been approved by Government and the Shah. 2, To-day, propaganda [gp. undec.? administration] announces that all foreign broadcasts are suspended viz those to Indian Army and British Army, broadcasts from Soviet House of Culture and ”About Poland” and finally the English lessons, 3. There are in fact no broadcasts to British troops from Radio Tehran. Sooner or later there will probably be a clamour for English lessons from Radio Tehran but meanwhile we can either wait or perhaps have lessons for Persians broadcast from Palestine, Suspension of daily broadcasts for Indian troops is however serious loss and I have suggested to minister for Foreign Affairs that Allies v/ho have troops in Persia should be allowed to broadcast to them in their own languages. 4-. On the whole, suppression of all broadcasts is a gain since Russians in Tehran can no longer attack Persian Government on its own radio and broadcast tendentious talks to Poland and unnecessary propaganda reflecting at times on their British (and American) allies - a matter which I am taking up with Soviet Ambassador separately. I think we may congratu late ourselves that we discontinued our propaganda broadcasts from Radio Tehran with dignity some months ago.

If however you think it important to keep the delegation out of the oil area, I agree that military authorities would be entitled to adopt procedure similar to that of Russian military authorities in like circumstances, viz. to refuse to allow delevation to enter oil area without passes issued by British Embassy Tehran, who could, if they wished, refuse to issue passes without prior reference to London.

Soviet broadcast in Persian from Radio Tehran which was cut off by Persian authorities vr as being given with typical cynicism in time allotted to Voks for Persian-Soviet Cultural Society. Insulting article from Pravda had been concluded before Director of Propaganda could reach the station but he cut everything short and broadcast the explanation that he had been compelled to take this action because Soviet broadcast, not for the first time, was not in accordance with Tripartite Treaty. This unexpectedly courageous action by Director of Propaganda has been approved by Government and the Shah. 2. Today, propaganda Lgp* undec. ?aGministration] announces that all foreign broadcasts are suspended viz those to Indian Army and British Army, broadcasts from Soviet House of Culture and -‘About Poland- 1 and finally the English lessons. 3. There are in fact no broadcasts to British troops from Radio Tehran. Sooner or later there will probably be a clamour for English lessons from Radio Tehran but meanwhile we can either wait or perhaps have lessons for Persians broadcast from Palestine. suspension of daily broadcasts for Indian troops is however serious loss and I have suggested to Minister for Foreign Affairs that Allies who have troops in Persia should be allowed to broadcast to them in their own languages. 4. On the whole, suppression of all broadcasts is a gain since Russians in Tehran can no longer attack Persian Government on its own radio and broadcast tendentious talks to Poland and unnecessary propaganda reflecting at times on their British ( and Jjnerican ) allies - a matter rr hich I am taking up with Soviet Ambassador separately.

Deputies at least behaved in a seemly manner but they made a few speeches and seem to have been unaffected by the Shah's appeal. Appeal is said however to have rested some impression oil the public and to have provoked telegrams to certain deputies appealing for unity^. 2. New Government has not yet been able to collect the quorum necessary for the Government to present itself officially to the Majlis. Every attempt is baffled by the minority who walk out. Several members who are afraid not to side with the minority were prepared to leave Tehrah thereby reducing the quorum required which is based on the number of Deputies present in Tehran. They state however that this intention has been frustrated by threats emanating from the Russians that unless they stay in Tehran and stick to rhe minority they will not be re-elected, their tenants will be told not to pay their rent and so on. 3.

In the South an intending candidate merely asked local British Consul whether his name was on the Black List, and if it was not he put up for election.

When candidatures were suggested by and discussed with Persians, official and other, we did not hesitate to make known our preferences. Although we occasionally objected to a candidate because he was believed to have been anti-British at some time or other, our criterion was not, as a general rule, the profession by a candidate of pro-British sentiments, but rather hie intrinsic worth as a Persian! our sole object was to ensure as far as possible the emergence of a relatively creditable and patriotic Majlis) and our attitude was fully justified by the state of the war, the undiminished importance of the Aid to Russia route and the possibility which still appeared to exist of averting financial and economic chaos through the preservation of the Millspaugh Mission. It was however inevitable that this attitude should expose us to much criticism on the part of our professional detractors. v.hat is more important, it enabled Persians of all shades of opinion (including those, such as Seyyed Zia, who had benefitted by our intervention but wished to discount the fact by a show of independence) to disclaim responsibility for the failings of the 14th Majlis, and hence for the country’s troubles in general, on the well-worn pretext that Persia continued to be the helpless victim of 'foreign rivalries' 1 . Finally, it gave the Russians an excuse, at least in retrospect, for their own much more vigorous and selfish intervention. 2. The circumstances attending the forthcoming elections will be radically different. Although, despite the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, foreign troops will still in all probability be present in large parts of the country, the main military justification for their presence will have disappeared. Persia has already cessed to be an essential link in Allied communications. She has moreover already deprived herself irrevocably of adequate foreign assistance in the ordering of her financial and economic affairs. Peace-time conditions of full sovereignty and national independence will not, unfortunately have been restored) but we for our part must do what we can to pave the way for their restoration. The first step in this direction is to maintain a resolutely impartial attitude in the matter of electoral candidatures. 3« Nothing, I realise, is more natural, where a candidate is obviously undesirable, than to express a preference for his rival. The ingrained Persian habit of seeking our advice on such questions has for years past provided ample excuse for so doing, and on a short-term view it may seem that no other attitude would promote either British or Persian interests. Nevertheless this is an attitude which would not be considered admissible for a British consular officer in even the most corrupt and backward 'normal' sovereign ‘Uate, e.g. in routh America) and we mast, in our own wider and long-term interests, begin to work now for the establishment of a normal attitude towards Persia on the part of all foreign Powers. Only by ourselves setting the example can we have any hope of achieving this result. 4. I shall therefore be glad if for the present you will All Consular Posts in PERSIA. /dec line^ r A * f 1 ^ d d i decline, consistently and even individual electoral candidfctu/ or other. Should it be found the Russians are unaffected by to intervene on a lar^e scale, revert to a more active policy principles which should govern the experiment a full and fair ostentatiously, to discuss es with aity Persian, official - as indeed it well may - that this attitude and continue it may later be necessary to at the expanse of the general us. I wish however to give test. 5* Those Persians who have habitually sought our advice in such matters hitherto may well be discountenanced and even di&amp;'*iayed at the outset by our new attitude. It must however be remembered that in the last analysis such people are only worth cultivating in so far as they may be capable of developing a sense of patriotic independence and self-hedp. It should be possible for you to remove any impression that we are losing interest in Persian affairs by explanations based on the foregoing paragraphs. You may say that we are very far from losing interest, and that it is precisely for this reason that we are trying to promote a spirit of national independence now that the international situation makes such an experiment possible. .Ho one, at the stage now reached, can be under any misapprehension as to the general type of parliament, or of individual parliamentary candidate, that we consider suitable. Nor, of course, will it be necessary for you to refrain from general and impersonal discussion of political questions ~ c.f. in this connection my circular aecpateh of the 4th May concerning the British attitude towards the Tudeh. 6 . It is not to be expected that any change of policy on our part will put a stop to the accusations of interference levelled against us by our detractors. But even in Persia the laws of evidence count for something, and these people are still no more than a vociferous minority of the population. What is important is to convince the reasonably honest end fair- minaed Persian that we mean what we say when we talk of restoring full Persian sovereignty, and that we for our part are making a real effort to break out of the vicious circle of foreign rivalries to which every Persian attributes his country^ misfortunes, deserved and other. If we have to revert to the old grooves later, we shall at least have ahown where the-blame lies. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, R. W. BULLARD. 6NCL0SU:.: air MAH.

H MEDIATE Soviet ambassador has proposed that he and I should infoiM Persian Prime Minister that we'are prepared to release all Persian internees forthwith. He wants a reply^soon and hints that otherwise he may make his communication without_further reference to me. I reminded him that our position differed from the Russians in that we are still at war. He professed to be unable to see any difference that should affect decision about internees. 2. There has been much agitation in the press and m Majlis on the subject and nev/ Minister for Foreign Rffairs nas asked twice whether internees could not now be released, though he admitted that the main object v/as to get credit lor his shaky Government. I replied on each occasion that the great majority of internees had already been released and more releases were being effected periodically (14 internees are being released at this moment) but that some Persians had been in contact \nth the Japanese with whom we were still at war._ Until to-day the^ attitude of the Soviet Rnbassador was stiff enough but he is acting on fresh orders from Moscow. 5. I propose that I should inform Persian Government that we are prepared to release such of the internees as are not likely to constitute a danger to our war effort, and that as Persian Government have declared war on Japan we expect them to understand our position. T7e must then re-examine our lists and see whether we cannot release considerable number either completely or in some cases to reside in some provincial town under # supervision. I have asked British security authorities to classify the re maining internees with that object in view. 4.

General tenure of Tehran telegram under reference has been discussed with Henderson and Allen of Near Eastern Division of State Department. Allen said that United States Ambassador at Tehran was packing[grp, undec. ? up] to go and that State Department had received scandalously meagre reports from him for the past month. Henderson added that they were awaiting the arrival of Hall ace Murray who was due at Tehran early in June. Once Wallace Murray took over Henderson hoped to get fuller reports and was confident that Wallace Murray would take an energetic interest in affairs and events in Persia and would collaborate closely with Sir R. Bullard. Neither Henderson nor Allen felt they could do much until Wallace Murray arrived but meanwhile they were^discussing the question of gendarmerie with Schwartzkopf who is now in Washington. They undertook to consider whether it would be possible^for any American editorial writer or commentator to produce an article on Persia which might then be telegraphed abroad but we cannot (repeat not) be sure that anything will come of this. Meanwhile if you have any definite suggestions to make I am confident that State Department will consider them as sympathetically as possible. [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.] O.T.P.retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on] Persian Government has recently received many disturbing reports about the situation in Mahabad, propaganda for Kurdish independence openly encouraged by Soviet Consul Rezaieh who in recent visit to Mahabad promised Russian support for the movement; that local Kurdish chief is enlisting Kurds for army but independently; that a pageant has been staged showing Kurdistan delivered from bondage by Russians. These reports are doubtless exaggerated or inaccurate but information from less biassed sources indicates that there is some truth in them. Russians still maintain their opposition to the despatch of adequate Persian Force to Mahabad. See 2. Some days ago Soviet Ambassador informed Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs that the Soviet military authorities insisted that the: Persian Army should begin operations for disarmament of the ,, brigands n of Ardebil and Mianeh districts within five days otherwise Soviet troops would undertake operations themselves. He repeated this demand with greater force on the 8th. The real motive for this is probably that Tudeh Party has met with strong opposition in Eastern Azerbaijan from Shahsavan tribe who are anti-Russian and loyal to the Central Government and from Landlords of Mianeh district whose followers have some arms.

There are increasing numbers of reports of formation of purely Kurdish police and military forces, linked with intensified propaganda for Kurdish independence. A demonstration has been held of which the main feature was a pageant showing Kurdistan delivered from bondage by the hands of Russia. One report of unknown Kurd speaks of Kurds financing their forces to the amount of 2,800,000 rials out of profits from the sale of tobacco and wheat in Itaq where Kurdish agents are now said to be negotiating contracts* 3. About a dozen persons of the land owning class have been expelled by the Soviet authorities from Mianeh during the past week for their part in the clash between the Tudeh and Khairiyeh parties on 1st April. They were brought to Tabriz but some later returned and no further action appears to have been taken against those still detained here. 4. Red Army is going ahead with the cultivation of land acquired in the suburbs of Tabriz. There are more complaints of arbitrary tree felling in the neighbouring villages.[This telegram ^ secrecy and should be ^ retained oy the authorised recipient and not passed on]* IMPORTANT. Nearly all foreign publicity about Persia from this part of the v/orld seems to be pro-Russian. Apart from Soviet Government's own propaganda, three long telegrams from American correspondents have recently advertised the Russian case. There was first Moscow message of New York Times special correspondent (my ielegram No.381). Before that the same man sent from here long interview with Iraj Iskandari leader of Tudeh in which the latter set forth irreproachably democratic view. Now war corres pondent on Chicago Daily News has also telegraphed interview with Iraj Iskandari in which the latter claims 100,000 members for Tudeh party, declares that it receives no money from Russians but lives on its subscriptions and in general, paints delightful democratic picture of that instrument of Soviet State policy. Next thing, His Majesty's Government will be accused of trying to turn Persia into a second Greece* 2. Resident agency correspondents can do little to stem this tide. Agencies want new§ not long political articles. Moreover, correspondents have to live here and to remain on good terns withthe Russians* Only visiting correspondents could afford to give fairly general picture of the'situation. American correspondents would be best but they can easily be caught by anyone who is anti-British and calls himself a democrat. United Stated Ambassador appears to avoid the Press and in any case he is too ignorant to guide correspondents* Let us hope Wallace Murray will be Dexter and that he will arrive soon* Meanwhile could State Department perhaps be asked their views of the situation in Persia? It may be some time before we can play our cards of readiness to evacuate at least considerable part of the country and would heln for the present if United States showed an &lt; interest in the situation.

This accounts for the urgency with which the Court have been pressing for the speedy liquidation of the affairs of the late Shah in South Africa. 2. It will be remembered that out of the 678,000,000 rials left in the bank by the late Shah, the present Shah 'lent” 400,000,000 to the Ministry of Finance, and that although certain charitable gifts made by the Shah have been debited to the latter sum, he was never allowed by Millspaugh to recover control of it. Meanwhile he spends much more even on his personal and family expenditure than the small civil list allowance, and in addition he has squandered large sums on subsidies to useless newspapers and individuals. 3. The Shah suggested to Dr. Millspaugh that some suitable estate should be lent to the Crown out of those of the late Shah*s estates that were acquired by an indefeasible title: this would remain the property of the state, but the reigning Shah would run it and enjoy the revenue, I believe that Dr. Millspaugh rather favoured this plan, which has much to recommend it, but he left before taking any action. 4. I do not know how near the Shah is to the bottom of the till, but if he has to apply for an increase in his Civil List while the public finances are in their present desperate state the application is unlikely to be granted, while it will bring much unpopularity on the Crown.. a t , \\i [Ti&amp;3 telegram is of, paift^Lcular sedrecy-'and should be j'^Iexained by the dn+ anfl n J0~ ,1,;.

This campaign took the lorm , . of (a) Reminders that Soviet Government were far from regarding the question as closed. (b) Predictions about unemployment that would result from wilful failure of Persian Government to permit exploitation of the country s natural resources in the North and (c) Dark hints that if the Government did not reconsider their decision it would be the worse for them. Appearing as it did in a section of the press which the Government dare not restrain fromopen incite ment to revolution, the campaign was inevitably subjecting the steadfastness or the Persians to ^ increasingly severe strain. The campaign has since died down though theme (b) still crops up at intervals and it may thus be inferred that the boyiet Embassy were instructed to call it off as a result of the Yalta Conference. 2. Nevertheless, the same section of the press continues its attacks on British ('imperialist reactionaries', 'masters of Reza Shah', 'interceders of Saeyed Eia and his Black Band' etc.) with [gp. undec.] Soviet disloyalty. There are excellent reasons for believing that the newspapers personally are directly inspired by the Soviet Embassy and that some at least of them are J ~ actually paid by the Russians in money or newsprint hut positive proof is naturally impossible to obtain m most cases. 5. In the course of a long article violently attacking Saeyed &amp;ia,Travda' not long ago quoted from a Persian news paper which is obviously Soviet - inspired a scarcely veiled attack on His Majesty's Government as that power which 'brought him to Persia and protects him'.

I have the honour to inform you that an official report from the British Military Authorities has now been received by this Embassy, to the following effect. 2. The incident occuured at a place on the zvin road where thefts of wire had been committed mary times before and where in consequence the British Military authorities had posted sentries with particular care. On the nimht of arch 2brd at about 11 p.m. a sentry heard someone give a warning ox ;nal as a car approached from the direction of Quzvin and then saw two ien trying to hide from the lights of the car. he challenged the men, ordering them to halt, hut they ran r&gt;:: \?, Wher sn te ired at them,' and other sen tri-a in the vicinity joined in the firing. It was then seen that the i.en attempting to escape were five. ' il of the five were killed by the shooting. On the oodies were found one revolver fully loaded, one heavy machett (a kind of bill-hook suitable for wire-outting) with a handle several feet long, and three Knives. 5. This report should be read in the light Ox 1 aide-memoire , which Sir Reader Bullard gave to Your Excellency on March 29th, and of many other communications which have been sent to tne Imperial Government at various times since the signature of the Treaty of Alliance in January 1942. During 1944 the length or wire stolen from the British, i merican and Russian forces in Persia amounted to 154 miles i.e., 215 kilometres. Many causes have contributed to this appay&amp;llng result, among them the omission of the Imperial G-overnnent to try to make the Iranian people realise the importance of Allied military communications end tre heinousness of the crime of cutting them, and the refusal of the Iranian courts to take the crime seriously when persons obviously guilty are brought beicre them. That ever the cas i se, however, the British military authorities who are responsible for the protection of communications from the ;ersian Tehran are bound to take strict measures in the exec lion oi . their task, and it was in the execution of that task that the g | five men in question lost their lives in the manner described above.

Resignation of Minister for Foreign Affairs was announced in the press 4 [grp undec ? days ago] but we hav still not been notified nor told who is to succeed him. Minister of War (one of the better members of the Cabinet) has gone to Palestine for prolonged medical treatment. Government is thus becoming more'and more of a farce but Bayat seems determined to remain. In this he has probably been fortified by the re-election yesterday of Tab; the as President of the Majlis by a very narrow majority. Bayat appears to enjoy at least qualified support of Russians, to whom a state of administrative paralysis is not unwelcome, and of the Shah who is widely said to be working for the exposure of the Majlis, as a prelude to some undefined derogation from constitutiorro#-'*^ regime. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs resignation may help to solve the problem of Persian delegation to San Francisco. Both Taqizaden and Ahi had refused to serve at the conference under Intizam and only remaining members of the delegation as originally planned were thus Siassi and Adi - both feather weights. Persians persist in regarding the conference as a prize giving at which they will obtain # 'full monetary compensation for all their sacrifices' if they shout loud enoughj and this belief is being exploited by Bayat, argument being that, if the Government is forced to resign while delegates are on the way, Persia will miss her chance. 5. I have had to protest very forcibly against outrageously insulting ironies of the Left Wing &gt; press about Indian troops in connexion with a recent incident in which [grp undec ?five] Persians were shot in an ambush designed to catch pilferers of telegraph wire. Case is allowed in that victims were not caught in the act though evidence of intent is fairly strong. But press # comments were quite inadmissible (they included allegations of cowardice 'when faced with Germans - not unarmed Persian civilians') and I have informed Bayat that^I do not think vou would wish His Majesty's Embassy to^continue —— conducting business with an administration which failedr^J,.

P.A.I.C.Saving. 0 0 0 0 0 Although deputies representing the majority of the Majlis have urged the Shah to call for resignation of Bayat, Bayat seems likely to stay in office at least for some days owing to general inertia and inability of deputies to agree *on a successor^ and prolonged new year holiday when the Government and administration are officially idle instead of just idle 2. Meanwhile financial situation is desperate and the Government are living from hand to mouth. No effective scheme to replace Millspaugh's economic organisation has been established. Separation of economic from financial functions in the provinces has led to delay in the distribution^of rationed goods, especially in rural areas, and this to the diminution of receipts from that source.. General failure to collect income tax has partly paralysed municipalities which were financed mainly by a cess on hat*tax and in order to make up deficit fresh indirect taxation is to be imposed on monopoly goods including oil products. This illustrates attitude of richer classes who blindly oppose the Tudeh party without being prepared to accept sacrifices' themselves. *3* It is, I think generally agreed that democracy, as inter preted by deputies *has* resulted in paralysis of lachinery of the Government. Persians, however, will probably have to continue to limp along as at present since any attempt to limit the power Lgrp. undec.] of the Majlis or to effect seriously increase in the authority of the Government would provide Tudeh with rallying cry against dictatorships which would be answered by ri^p y who are far from Left in politics but who suffered in reign of Reza Shah.

Lewis is believed here to be slightly mad. He is full of confidential schemes, from the establishment for Persia of an American organisation similar to that which dealt with the Philippines in the first year after conquest, to the defeat of the efforts of Tudeh by means of a Gallup poll run by Gallup in person.

The opposition of the Russians, based partly on the belief that he is backed by us and partly, I suspect, on the fear that he might have some success in pulling this wretched country together, is so great, that no Majlis would dare to accept him even as a minister, still less as prime Minister, so long as there were foreign troops in the country. 2.

The present government also has this aim, and an ill-drafted law just published about the alienation of sta^e lands, provides for the sale of state lands to displaced o. ficials regardless of the fact that when irrigated SwUte lands in triual area^ have been allocated, there will probably be no state lands left but areas requiring irrigation schemes to i.-uko then productive, hoi* is it ever explained why a relatively bad official should make a good farmer. The question of the redundant official must be dealt with, il essential officials are to receive &amp; wage which, though it may not raise them above temptation, will at least justify the courts in punishing them for corruption. It is reckoned however that at least two-thirds 01 uQe existing officials are superfluous, and there stands between them and discharge not only the problem of an alternative livelihood, but ohe fact that each of then is the relative of someone in authority to whom the public weal means nothing and family ties mean a great deal. Yet until officials are decently paid nothing can he done, and even to be certain .hat something would be done then- one would b « convinced that most Persians who at present nave enough to ( 1 .^ reasonably honest. I have no such conviction, aaiyid &amp;ia s re Yorms, and any other reforms, depend mainly on a change in the moral character of the Persian of which there is at present no sign. The late Shah reduced the influence of religion (for what that was ever worth) and set an example of cynical dishonesty which his officers and oificials followed onl^ r too eagerly; and altho gh here and there t ere are honest Persians who deplore this and themelves set a good example, th^rais no sT-i of a Savonarola or a Wesley to call the people to or of a general movement in favour of the civic virtues which might serve as the only alternative motive power to a despo.ism. 3 saivid Zia shows rashness (Article 1 (d)) in supporting no .on.ci.’jc. ^ no 5 .UM 0 .I ^ ■ perpetual neu.rality ^ A well a8 itB privileges, riut it is not 'necessnrjfto prolo^ comments on a programme which is unli^eiy to be translated into action. 4 . tlocies of this despatch and of its enclosure are being sent to the Government .of.India, New-Delhi, Minister resident, -idale -a , and to all Consular Officers in rersia.

The ''National ’will 1 ' Party is convince,, that Persia must, in future, keep away from all international disputes and preserve complete neutrality with regard to any differences that may arise between th&lt;- Great cowers, and must, therefore, d?ter the end of the war pursue a policy of friendship towards all the Governments and peoples of the world based on the equality of rights of nations and the principle of reciprocity. It should aim at signing and entering into a perpetual treaty with net labouring Governments to the effect that Persia s neutrality should be respected as the neutrality of Switzerland i r -pr-p; t.O.a .I i her forei/Ti policy lersia should }lo herri^most tio sin cere st possible relations m t h2r 4 (b) ^in preserve the l ^uaaiu±c re a ae ions wi e rv^uj-L.^-CU-r uro, particularly with the U.S.S.R. , and Great Britain. The ’’National Will'’ Party considers it its duty to fight against all persons or parties who support a one-sided policy within the limits set down by the laws of the country. Persia must try to establish the best possible relations with the U.

Oppos iti on to Dictator ship. article 20, Bince lersia’s prosperity is indissolubly bound up with the setting up of a national government and democratic principles, the ’^National ’/ill” Party is opposed to any form of'dictatorship of an individual or minority - whether this dictatorship is as sociated with the proletariat or whether it is a military or reactionary dictatorship. Consequently no class should be able to monopolise the Government of the Persian nation which should bo composed of all the different classes.

Z-Z-Z-Z-Z IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL . Economic situation at Isfahan needs watching notonly because of its intrinsic importance but also because it may be exploited by the Russians. 2. Under the regime of orotection in the time of the late Shah, Isfahan factory owners made large profit while ill- paid workers were unable to raise their voice. During the war diminution of imports has enabled owners to make &lt; enormous sums in spite of increase in wages. Prices of textiles have now dropped to such an extent that factories are selling nothing. Attempts to stop ovepr-time (work one shift instead of two; or reduce wages have proved ineffective because workers cannot be coerced. When owners threatened to close the factories the Government said that this would not be^ allowed. Owners are now manoeuvering in the hope of being able to close down on the pretext of inability to pay income tax and thereby throw the odium for suspension of work on to Millspaugh. Factories have never been run on # economic lines and in normal times could hardly compete with imported goods with customs dues at their present level. Whatever happens '* ■ factories can hardly continue to support present number of workers at present rates of pay. 3. Tudeh party has not enjoyed allegiance of all Isfahan workers lately, largely because members resent the use of their heavy subscriptions for political purposes in Tehran, but if it came to a struggle with owners or Government, Tudeh party would tend to regain control because they would have ideas and backing provided, there is no doubt, by Marchenko the new Soviet Consul in Isfahan. M. was removed from Tabriz at the request of the Persian Government, returned as Acting Consul, and organised election by intimidation of several Tudeh candidates to the Majlis was again removed at the Persian Government's request, but was posted immediately to Isfahan.

Moscow. ’ QQQQQQ The question of the wisdom of our continuing to broadcast from Radio Tehran has become acute. Two and a half years ago when .every means however slender had to be used to convince the Persians that in spite of appearances the Allies would win the war* we obtained from the Persian Government the right to use Radio Tehran for half an hour nightly. Besides our own broadcasts in Persian, broadcasts usually in French, have been given during our period - regularly by French^ Polish, Dutch and Greeks and occasionally by Belgians. Some time ago we discontinued giving news bulletins and concentrated on talks of a general educational character. Above mentioned Allies however continued to broadcast whatever they liked subject to Tripartite censorship. 2, , When Mr.Savidge the . Director of Public Relations was instructed to return to India some four months ago, I asked him whether he would advise our continuing to broadcast from Radio Tehran, I found that he shared my opinion that the influence of these activities was slight and did'notv justify the^expense but Public Relations Bureau decided to continue until the new Director had had time to study the problem. Additional objection to my mind was the possibility that Russians may begin to broadcast, using our example as a precedent,and as usually happens in.such cases might do more harm than we could eve£ do good. This has now happened, 5. On October 19th a broadcast in Persian was given from_Radio Tehran nominally by Persian-Soviet Cultural Society but in fact by Russians. There were four parts (1) Passages from a book by a Russian writer described as a revolutionary and a Communist about a priest who is cruel to school children. (2) 'Extracts about the oil question from Persian newspaper which is published by Soviet Embassy and from one which is obviously paid by them. . (3) Account of glories of Tajikistan, the Persian-speaking Republican. (4) Statement about the freedom of religion in Russia. 4. Having failed to induce the Prime Minister _(your telegram No.413) to allow Polish patriots to broadcast, Soviet Embassy recently put pressure and obtained permission for the embassy to broadcast news of Russians in Poland which of course amounted to the same thing. My Polish colleague informs / me4 2 me that first broadcast though naturally tendentious 'was..n 6 t too hostile to the official Poles but ^..saw the Soviet -5 Ambassador and suggested 'that If was &amp;' mistake to do anything to exacerbate feelings on Polish question at the moment^when Churchill and Marshal Stalin were trying to effect a' 1 ■/;. settlement in Moscow and I proposed with the concurrencj“tJf'&gt; 4 - the Polish Minister that'Polish,Legation, which* in ah^ubasV had never broadcast- in Polish but only in French or Persian ' should cease to broadcast and that Soviet Embassy should abandon its new broadcasts in Polish, I said that in theory I should be fully justified in giving uncensored official Polish broadcasts as British news bulletins in Polish, however loyalty and propriety forbade that._ Soviet Ambassador asked for 24 hours to' think it over and used the interval to telegraph Moscow, Since Russians have the advantage no-reply is likely to be received for a long time and meanwhile Polish ’’bulletins” by Soviet Embassy will continue to be broadcasts' Polish Minister’s latest draft broadcast has however heeiif passed without excision by Soviet censorship, .'..This never.;-' happened before. ..

Relations between the Soviet and Persian Authorities -From whatever Ov-» i 3 A ty-n no. // 'V.p. n o. . hi angle these relations are viewed they can hardlv be considered satisfactory or m conformity with the spirit of the Tehran Declaration. On the one hand, the / Russians, by showing a marked preference for subservient Persian officials and tyhiA objecting to the appointment of officials of any independence of character, have contributed largely to the continued ineffectiveness of Persian administration, particularly as regards the security services. There has, moreover, been constant interference in internal affairs on matters unconnected with occupation necessities, which can reasonably be ascribed to a desire to assert Soviet authority both in the eyes of the administration and the populace. On the other hand, Soviet officials assert in and out of season that internal affairs are the exclusive responsibility of the Persian administration, on whom they cast the blame for all disorders and maladministration which their own action has helped to render inevitable. Neithei in Eastern nor W estern Azerbaijan has there been anv sign of a loyal collaboration, which would have safeguarded essential Russian interests in the prosecution of their war effort, while at the same time heightening the prestige, authority and efficiency of the local government. 3. Objects of Soviet Policy in Azerbaijan:—The misgivings to which Soviet duplicity in local affairs has naturally given rise have been confirmed and strengthened by So\iet intrigues, played on a wider stage, to secure the return of their own nominees in the recent Azerbaijan elections. There is certainly no abatement of anxiety as to their ulterior motives and it would be difficult to find a single Azerbaijani of any consequence ready to assert with any show of certainty that the Russians intend to honour their pledge to evacuate Azerbaijan ) at the end of the wai. The Russians, by their attitude, have succeeded in creating a general impression that their permanent interests in Azerbaijan are definitely political as well as cultural and economic'and that their political ambitions are of a nature incompatible with Persian sovereignty. It is quite possible that by systematic undermining of the authority of the Persian Government in Azerbaiian they may hope to bring about a situation where subversive elements in the two provinces will, with their surreptitious support, declare their independence of Persia and link their future with Soviet Azerbaijan. This is what is often hinted at by Tudeh Iran orators, hoped for by the Armenian and Assyrian minorities as a whole and feared by most Muslims of any standing. Mv own view is that while the professions of Soviet officials strongly denv any such intentions, Soviet practice aims at maintaining a fluid situation such as will easily lend itself to whatever definite line of policy is eventually decided. It will be easv to terminate the occupation, but it will be equally easv to find a pretext for its prolongation. A third alternative, perhaps the most likely, is that the Soviet Government will continue to occupy a predominant position short of actual military occupation, maintaining a large number of officials and exercisino through its influence in Azerbaijan a kind of permanent.pressure on the Persian Government, especially in connexion with the elimination of other foreign interests, whether economic or otherwise, from Northern Persia. 4. Soviet Officials—It should be noted that during the period under review suspicions of Soviet designs have been undoubtedly heightened by the conduct of individual Soviet officials, and in particular by that of M. Serge Marchenko the acting Soviet Consul-General at Tabriz. The sinister &amp; activities of M. Marchenko had previously come under notice at the time when he was vice-consul and the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs had secured his temporary removal from Tabriz. That he later returned without so far as is [57—581 R 'k 10known, the consent of the Persian Government, is evidence that he is approved in responsible Soviet quarters. M. Marchenko has been particularly active in pressing the local authorities to secure the election of Soviet candidates for the Majlis, but as this enterprise clearly enjoyed the blessing of his superiors in Tehran they cannot be exonerated from responsibility for the methods employed. The intervention of M. Marchenko and his immediate collaborators has been equally mischievous in other matters, for example, the local labour troubles, where^^ by maintaining close relations with professional agitators and other undesirable elements the impression has, with good reason, been created that they have Soviet support both against the factory owners and, more important, against the local ! authorities. Both as regards their election candidates and in other matters the \ Russians have shown singularly little judgment in the people they have chosen \ to promote their interests, and this fact alone suffices to account for. much of the jsuspician attaching to their actions. If undesirables are chosen, plans are * suspect. If, on the other hand, their intentions are honourable, they have been singularly unfortunate in having representatives unable to inspire the confidence . and secure the collaboration of the best elements of the population. Throughout Azerbaijan in varying degrees it has been the same story. Another reflection on Soviet representatives is to be found in the frequent stories of Soviet officials who have succumbed to the lure of private gain in collusion with Persian officials and others. These reports are too numerous and circumstantial to be entirely discounted. A new Soviet Consul-General, M. Fedor Matveev, has recently arrived in Tabriz, but it is yet too early to judge whether this signifies a change of policy in spite of a profession of principles to which no one could take exception. 5. Soviet Propaganda .—Tudeh Iran, with its affiliated or semi-affiliated organisations, continues to be the main channel of pro-Soviet propaganda. This propaganda is characterised by an almost entire lack of ideological content and the name of Marx, for example, is never mentioned. It is directed mainly towards (a) emphasising the injustices and exploitation suffered by the peasants and workers of Azerbaijan £t the hands of landlords, factory owners, and, last but not least, the Tehran-directed Persian administration, whose venality and inefficiency is a perpetual source of bitter criticism with the underlying suggestion that Azerbaijan could well be rid of the Persian nexus; (b) pointing to the military achievements of the Soviet Union and their advances in the cultural and economic spheres as compared with the backwardness of this country, thus encouraging gravitation towards the stronger and more prosperous neighbour; (c) protesting against the activities of Seyyid Zia and other persons supposed to represent anti-Soviet interests in Persia. 6. Other forms of propaganda also flourish under the direct control of the Soviet authorities, consular and military. The principal function of the Turki newspaper Vatan Yolinda, edited by persons from Baku, is the dissemination of Soviet news, particularly those of Soviet Azerbaijan, whose bonds with Persian Azerbaijan are constantly stressed. A Persian newspaper, the Kharvar Nov, whose publication has recently been started in Tabriz, is also subsidised by the Russians. A large Soviet hospital accepting patients from the local population is shortly to be opened, the buildings acquired for the purpose having been radically transformed at considerable expense. Other projects in course of realisation include a school, a large cinema to show exclusively Russian films and a branch of the Soviet-Persian Cultural Society with the large pavilion in the municipal gardens for its premises. There have been periodical visits of artists from Baku. The Soviet Consulate-General has also been making determined efforts to bring Azerbaijan mullahs under its influence by encouraging them to develop relations with their confreres in Soviet Azerbaijan, but the local fish have proved wary. Mention must also be made of the fact that a large proportion of the Soviet troops in Azerbaijan are of Caucasian origin and are fervent propagators of the idea of a Greater Azerbaijan. « 7. On the whole it can, however, be said with certainty that, leaving out of account the minorities, and those elements who seek material benefits in a closer Russian connexion, the results of Soviet propaganda have not been markedly ^ successful. Muslim suspicion of Soviet Russia remains deep-rooted, and the present Russian influence in Azerbaijan is due to fear, not affinity. The j population as a whole desire nothing better than a speedy evacuation of Russian I troops and a cessation of Russian interference in their affairs. This feeling has been somewhat heightened in the past few weeks by a forced levy made on merchants, officials and others under the guise of a garden party in aid of the Red Army’s victory fund. By pressure of different kinds about L.15,000 was raised in Tabriz alone.3 roved ve in &gt;r the &gt;rs in oyed. been vhere^^ irable Soviet local *s the hosen &gt;f the 3 are been dence &gt;hout )ii on ; who 3 and :irely rived iolicy iated This , and ^ards and t but and stion ) the i and thus )our; sd to f the urki m of 'sian Nov, i the ition been e of and i the lists dned m to have &gt;n of •vent it of loser :edly the The isian has 3 on the was 8. Persian Administration in Eastern Azerbaijan*. —After various efforts to find a Governor-General acceptable to the Russians and at the same time willing to acquiesce in the present limited prerogatives and restricted dignity of the post, Mehdi Dadvar (Vussuq-es-Sultaneh) was finally appointed and took up his duties on the 23rd March last. His age and vacillating temperament alike unfit him to cope successfully with Tabriz, and he has failed either to improve the ^administration or to achieve popularity. Sartip Jawadi, commander of the Persian troops in Azerbaijan, after complaining for many months of the impotence to which Russian control condemned him, has been replaced at Russian behest. The present strength of Persian troops in Azerbaijan is estimated at about 6,000. The Russians do not allow reinforcemenff from outside, and all I movements in Azerbaijan, of whatever nature, are subject to their permission. It is reported, however, that some concession may shortly be made as regards the movement of troops of a given garrison within its allotted area. In Tabriz the police remain useless and corrupt, but the obsequiousness of their acting chief and various commissars, whose replacement by persons animated by a stronger sense of public duty is a crying need, seems to have secured them Russian protection. Public security has, however, been noticeably improved by the formation of mixed Persian-Soviet patrols for night duty. The Tabriz Municipality, whose finances are now controlled by Dr. Millspaugh, has suffered from an acute shortage of funds and no serious effort is being made to repair the streets or perform essential services, such as the removal of garbage. Water has been in short supply throughout the summer, to a large extent due to the non- maintenance of “ qanats ” and illicit diversion. The Supply Department has failed to supply the population in Tabriz, as elsewhere, with regular supplies of rationed goods, the principal obstacles being defective organisation, lack of transport and official corruption rather than shortage of stocks. Health services have remained entirely neglected, but a mild winter and bread in plenty have limited the incidence of disease. 9. Situation in Western Azerbaijan. —On the 19th July last Dr. Hussein Marzban was succeeded as Governor-General by Sarhang AH Akbar Durakhshani, a former commander of the troops at Rezaieh and later of the 3rd Division at Tabriz. This change followed some weeks of disorder, of a nature considerably more serious than is usual at each harvest season, among the Kurdish tribes to the north and south of Rezaieh, culminating in a threat to sack Rezaieh by Kurds of the Herki tribe under Zero Beg. The population of Rezaieh reacted by demonstrating against the Persian and, indirectly, the Russian authorities for their failure to maintain order. In the course of these demonstrations Dr. Marzban was assaulted by the crowd, suffering minor injuries. He thereupon resigned, rightly considering a further tenure of office impossible. Sarhang Durakhshani is now striving to increase the authority of the Administration and to reach a good understanding with the Russians,' which is an indispensable condition. He proposes also to apply the law of the land equally to all Persian citizens without distinction, whether they are Muslims or members of racial minorities. So far he has met with some success and the situation is at present quiet. 10. Prior to the arrival of Sarhang Durakhshani the authority of the Persian Administration among the tribes had been to all intents and purposes non-existent, and Kurdish chiefs were able with impunity to behave with extreme insolence towards the authorities. In practice it was only the Russians who could exert any real control over these fully armed tribes, but they for their part; while maintaining close relations with the Kurds through their consulate at Rezaieh and political officers, declined to accept any sort of responsibility for Kurdish conduct, always alleging that it was the concern of the' Persians and only intervening when the Persians had signally failed to deal with a potentially dangerous situation. At the same time the Russians denied the Persians the possibility of effective armed intervention by which alone, unless the Russians were prepared loyally to support the Administration, the authority of that Administration could be vindicated. The only Persian garrison in Western Azerbaijan is stationel at Rezaieh, has a total strength of about 1.400 and is poorly equipped. Each time that it was proposed to use this garrison against Kurdish breakers of the peace Soviet permission was not forthcoming, the Soviet authorities themselves dismissing the tribesmen when they thought they had had enough rope. As no punishment has been meted out to the unruly Kurds there is a natural tendency for them to see how far thev can go, knowing that at the worst they will only be sent home like naughty boys by the Russians. The gendarmerie as at present constituted has, for its part, proved of little, if any, [57—58] B 24 use in the preservation of order. Weak in effectives—the two extra battalions considered necessary for this province will remain a paper project they are of poor quality and low in morale, 'their small pay, of which a proportion is often retained by their officers, obliges them to live to a great extent on the country. Little loved by the Persian villagers, they are an object of intense hatred to the Kurds, to whom their presence is an outrage and constant provocation. I hey are detested by the Kurds, in fact, far more intensely than the Persian army, whosef^ visitations in the past have often been painful but were not continuous. 11. The quietest part of Western Azerbaijan in recent months has been the Mahabad district, where there are neither gendarmes nor troops, either Persian or Russian, and where Soviet representation has been limited to a single political officer. The Farmandar is inactive to the extent that his presence is hardly noticed, and his few police do not appear after dark, when security is assured by guards organised by the local Kurdish chief, Ghazi Mohammed. 1 he Kurdish chiefs in this district are therefore left fairly well to themselves and, in spite of their mutual jealousies, any serious incidents have been avoided. It is only fair to add, however, that the population is more purely Kurdish and the tribes noticeably less bellicose than further north. , 12. Majlis Elections.—The Majlis elections in Azerbaijan have thrown an interesting light on the close connexion between the action of Soviet officials in Azerbaijan and the policv of the Soviet Embassy in Tehran. While, after considerable wrangling, the list of Russian proteges whose successful candidature was to be promoted was decided with the Persian Government in lehran. it was left to the Soviet consuls in Azerbaijan to see that the local authorities carried out their instructions for rigging the elections. Thus, for example, electoral committees and individual officials were subjected to constant peisonal piessure, even remote districts being visited by Soviet officials for this purpose. Pressure bordering on intimidation was likewise exercised through Tudeh Iran and many voters who favoured independent candidates were kept from the polls by fear of violence. The better elements of the population, moreover, took exception to the Russian nominees on grounds of their general qualifications. As regards Tabriz, Pishivari was previously an unknown person and unaided could not have gathered more than a handful of votes. Ipekehian is a merchant of no paiticulai standing and semi-illiterate. The climax of Soviet intervention was, however, reached in the elections at Ardebil and for the Armenian and Assyrian Deputy. In the former, the Soviet candidate, sheikh Hussein Lenkorani, who has been described by the Governer-General at Tabriz as an unknown adventurer, received 18.406 votes out of a total poll of 20,122. In the latter. Ardashez Hovhannasian. the Armenian Tudeh Iran candidate, was elected by 5,056 votes, no more than 12 beino- cast against him, thus providing an almost perfect example of a true Soviet election. It was often suggested in the course of these elections that, n the Russians really desired to combine the protection of their interests with the welfare of Persia, it would have been possible to have found and backed more reputable candidates convinced of the necessity of closer relations between the two countries to their mutual advantage. As it is, their preference has been giyea to persons with little or nothing to lose—opportunists and aclxentuiers, willing to sacrifice their countrv at the word of command. It is an unfortunate fact that in the political as in other spheres, the Russians have appeared anxious to attract to themselves those who, whatever their personal defects, can be. relied on to serve as instruments of their policy. . . . ^ , 13. Labour Situation .—Just as in Western Azerbaijan it is the Kurdish problem, so in Eastern Azerbaijan it is the labour unrest in Tabriz that represents the greatest threat to public order. The Soviet attitude to both these questions is practically identical. Officially, they are matters concerning the Persian Administration; in actual practice Soviet officials maintain close relations with both Kurds and labour organisations, which are equally amenable to their lead. For some months after the visit to Tabriz in August 1943 of Dr. Sheikh of the Ministry of Labour, when a settlement highly favourable to the workers was reached' there was a period of comparative calm. But prices continued to rise while the distribution of monopoly goods remained uncertain thus gradually nullifying some of the benefits of the award. Since April last the workers have been formulating demand after demand, to which the owners have replied with concession after concession, feeling that the workers have a backing too strong to withstand and being unable to rely on any effective mediation by the local authorities. With every concession, however, the attitude of the workers has become more aggressive, while their output has sunk to a fraction of the normal. Conditions are now entirely anarchical; almost daily incidents are reported, suei* 5 as stay-in strikes, expulsion of the managements and threats to kill the owners. A last effort is to be made by the owners to reach a firm agreement with the workers and to obtain the overt support of the local and Soviet authorities for the agreement when reached, but success appears very doubtful. 14. The background to this unrest is largely political, hor the purpose of the Majlis elections, Tudeh Iran, with Soviet encouragement, attempted, with a Considerable degree of success, to form a pro-Soviet common front with the two labour unions and other Leftish organisations, like the Anti-Fascist party. The politico-economic agitation thus started has lately been given a fresh and more dangerous impetus by the rejection of Pishivari’s mandate by the Majlis. A labour agitator, named Khalil Inqilab, assured with some reason of Soviet support, flouted the local authorities, who wished to expel him, and addressed mass meetings of an increasingly violent and revolutionary character, finally, on the 14th July, with the acquiescence of the Soviet Consul-General, he was arrested by the local police and military to the accompaniment of considerable bloodshed, t for which the authorities blame the workers, who resisted his arrest, while the workers and Russians blame the authorities. After a short interval to take stook of the position and decide a line of action, Tudeh Iran and others organised mass meetings of protest, demanding retribution for the workers’ blood spilt and at the same time Majlis acceptance of Pishivari and other Russian-sponsored Deputies. Although at the moment of writing the campaign has lost much of its intensity, a significant step has just been taken in the arbitrary amalgamation of the ludeh Union, the Workers’ Union and the Anti-Fascist party in the Tudeh-directed Workers’ Council of Azerbaijan under the presidency of Birya, an unprincipled scavenger-lampoonist, whose Soviet connexions have brought him to comparative affluence. Admittedly, there is considerable divergence of views among the twenty-seven members of the committee of the new body, but. as its leaders are 1 under Soviet control, the Russians cannot escape responsibility for its actions in the future. 15. Economic Situation—The immediate post-war period, with the accom panying adjustment of local prices to some workable relationship with world levels is likely to prove of considerable hardship to most classes. But it is fortunate that'the excellent harvests of the last two years have provided a reserve of grain which should be sufficient to guarantee the population against actual hunger, while the surplus can be disposed of within Persia at the internal price level. The situation as regards dried fruits, Azerbaijan’s principal export, is much less favourable. War conditions (Germany was previously the chief buyer) and Soviet restrictions on export have caused a considerable part of last year’s crop to remain unsold and the bulk of this year’s crop is likely to be wasted through insufficient demand at remunerative prices. Although the Soviet Union has been taking increasing quantities of these products, the prices paid, which they are able to fix for themselves by their method of export control, represent little or no profit to the cultivators/whose costs have been greatly increased by inflation. Costs in the local carpet industry, also working for export, have risen by many hundred per cent., about half the looms have already been closed down in consequence, and it is difficult to see how Tabriz caipets with then infenpi artistic merit will be able to compete with machine-made goods, when again available, at anything like the present prices. Tabriz textile and other factories, working for the home market, likewise seem predestined to difficult times. In their early days they owed what success they had to chenp laboui and high protective tariffs, but wages have now risen 1,200 to 1,500 per cent, and othei costs in about the same proportion. Because of restricted inports there is still a market for their low-quality products, but it is likely that when peace is restored they will be undersold by 'Soviet and other imported goods as well as by the protective tariffs, but wages have now risen 1,200 to 1,500 per cent, and other costs in about the same proportion. Because of restricted imports there is still a balance between production and selling costs is reached. The unemployment thus occasioned may well add to the political troubles of Azerbaijan. 16. The Soviet Trade Agency is acquiring an increasing share of all import and export business and the Soviet Union seems destined to replace Germany as principal supplier and customer. There is, however, a seemingly excellent opportunity for Great Britain to increase its pre-war trade, particularly m drugs, better qualitv textiles, bicycles, radios, &amp;c., and several local merchants have expressed a desire to develop British connexions. It is not merely, however, the proximity of Soviet Russia but also the methods at present adopted, which, if continued may render successful competition difficult. At the moment, for example the Soviet Trade Agency pays scant regard to such matters as Persianimport licences. Whatever the Russians want to import, they import whether authorised or not, and Persian customs officials are powerless to withstand them. Ihe prices of their imports have, moreover, no relation to world prices, but are what the local market will bear. Thus, at the present time Russian sugar is being sold at Rls. 110 (17s. 2d.) per kilo, customs duty paid. 17. There is continued lack of confidence in the future of Azerbaijan on the part of the merchant classes. Those who left Tabriz at the time of tl^^ Soviet occupation for Tehran and other places in the south have unanimous^^^ decided not to 'return, and several have recently liquidated their remaining interests. Others are also transferring their capital southwards for security against possible Soviet designs. For the same reason, shares of Tabriz factories are quoted at not more than 40 per cent, of the price of shares of corresponding factories in Ispahan. The price of property is low compared with the south and buyers are few. 18. Local Attitude to Great Britain .—Among foreign Powers, Germany easily held pride of place in Azerbaijan, and her impending defeat, which is now reluctantly taken for granted, is causing profound disappointment, especially among the business classes. Self-interest now demands a new orientation and there are many who, wishing to escape the clutches of the Russian bear, look to Great Britain for political and economic help. It is frequently asserted that as it was the British who brought the Russians here it is their bounden duty to ensure their departure, or else suffer final eclipse in Persian eyes. 19. Much good work has been done in making known the British viewpoint through the publicity shop in Tabriz, maintained by the Public Relations Bureau in Tehran. The increasing distribution of literature covers not only Tabriz but Rezaieh and various country towns. The window displays attract much interest and many hundreds daily listen to the news broadcasts from London and other stations. There is a widespread desire to learn English, but there is an acute shortage of textbooks and teachers. It is very necessary, in my opinion, to arrange adequate facilities for the studv of English and for the dissemination of pro- British literature as permanent features of our economic and cultural propaganda in Azerbaijan. From a trade point of view alone this should prove a remunerative investment. 20. Conclusion .—The future of Azerbaijan depends on two interrelated factors : (1) The post-war policy of Soviet Russia, and (2) the ability or otherwise of the Persian Government to develop a strong and efficient local administration. The immediate post-war period is likely to prove a time of economic crisis with which the present administration will almost certainly be unable to cope. The resulting anarchical conditions may well afford a pretext for the detachment of Azerbaijan from Persia or for the continuance of the present status. To avoid the possibility of such a contingency it should be the urgent duty of the Tehran authorities to overhaul the administrative machine, appointing the best officials at its disposal to key posts. It is in any event seemingly inevitable that the economic and cultural bonds between Soviet Russia and Azerbaijan should be drawn much closer. Further than that it can only be hoped that a basis of loyal understanding will be reached between the Persian and Soviet Governments which will render unwarranted the somewhat gloomy forebodings of this despatch. 21 In accordance with the instructions contained in your circular despatch under reference, I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Office, the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India, the Minister Resident ^in Cairo, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow, His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah, C.I.CI. sub-centre, Tehran, and G.S.I. {a) (1), G.H.Q., New Delhi.

R. 10.35 a.m. 20th October, 1944, S.;? *i‘ E Xransovtrans are ceasing their commercial activities hut this is attributed not to any respect for Persian independence but to the sudden fall in wholesale prices which has led to a great diminution in goods traffic and consequently to a drop in freight rates. 2. All road transport is subject to the control of the Persian Road Transport Department except United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and Iransovtrans, Exception was based on the hypothesis that these two organisations existed for military ends and would not carry any but military freight unless requested to do so by the Persian authorities. This hypothesis was justified m the case of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation who want nothing better now that their military obligations are coming to an end than to close down as a transport organisation and to release their hired lorries. With Iransovtrans however it is clear that other considerations apply. What they are it is easy to guess. The use of Iransovtrans lorries (provided under Lease/Lend or hired from Persian owners) for commercial purposes is good propaganda not only because it shows the flag but because it enables supporters to be gained by favours in the matter of tyres, special rates,_and so on. Moreover until freight rates fell it was a good way to make money. The Soviet authorities in Persia draw Rials 80,000,000 per mensem under an official agreement with the Persian Government but this is evidently insufficient for their needs, which includes bribes to newspapers, subsidies to the Tudeh Party and other dubious activities and to make up the difference the Soviet authorities will go to great lengths e,g, by competing in transport with private traders who have to^submit to control which .the Soviet organisation escapes; by selling goods at top prices in .the open market; and so on. 5, Iransovtrans are abandoning their unfair competition and the consequent propaganda because for the moment it does not pay in money Dut at any time they may re-enter* I &gt; HR - THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 77* i&gt;i&gt; -n I7p 2.00^ PERSIA. tftbNFIDE NTTAL. • /E 5847/189/34] &amp;&gt;° NNIcTftj&amp;JESTY’S GOYE DD O September 25, &amp; u A &gt;1 IMocr , ^ Section X. . v ^ 112 - n N'F Copy No. UU o Mr. LasceUes to Mr. Eden.—(Received ‘INK September.)

Tehran, Mh September, 1944. ’ WITH reference to Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No. 148 of the 3rd Amil I have the honour to submit a further report( 1 ) on the composition of the 14th Majlis, together with lists( 1 ) showing the position at the 31st August, 1944. The first list shows the constituencies and their members : the second, the Deputies in alphabetical order, classified according to their economic and political activities. 2. The number of Deputies elected up to the 31st August. 1944, whose credentials have not been rejected by the Majlis, is 128. Elections have not been completed at Abadeh, Firuzabad and Saqqiz. I timad ut-Tauliya has been elected for Rey, but his credentials have not yet been brought before the Majlis. New elections are due for two of the Tabriz seats, and for Darajiz; the credentials of the three Deputies concerned having been rejected by the Chamber. One Tehran seat is unoccupied, pending a decision in the case of the German agent Abul Qasim Kashani, who was among the twelve elected for Tehran. 3. Of the 128 Deputies so far elected, 44 sat in the 13th Majlis. Of these 36 have been re-elected for the same constituencies. 4. According to the classification shown on list 2, 65 of the present Deputies are landowners; 13 are connected with commerce and industry; 4 are mullas (*) Not printed [58—6]deriving their power from local religious influence; and 46 depend on various forms of political activity. The last category includes a number who were elected to serve the interests of landlords, merchants and industrialists. 5. The Tudeh group has been reduced from 8 to 7 members, owing tc the^— expulsion from the party of Rahman Quli Khal Atbari. The Tudeh-sponsored Tabriz Deputy, Pishavari, was rejected by the Majlis. 6 . The other Majlis groups fluctuate in membership, and are not worth reporting on in detail. About a quarter of the total number of Deputies, including some of the most influential, do not belong to any Majlis group. 7. During the first six months of its life the 14th Majlis has passed very little legislation, having been preoccupied with intrigues over the composition of Cabinets, the Millspaugh problem and the credentials of elected Deputies. Since the bulk of the members are actuated by no political principle, it is not surprising that efforts to form a stable majority in the Majlis have so far been unsuccessful.

The State Department now have the impression that War Department may not prove as difficult over the matter as they had feared. They wonder whether 5 extra men would be enough and whether Schwartzkopi would not really need 10 or 15, In any case they are willing to press War Department if the matter is put to tnem from Tehran.

Recently Hama Rashid drove out Mahmud Kanesenani from Merivan and sent to Persian Government impudent telegram which challenged their authority and upset the complete understanding on which peace between the Persian Government and the Kurds in that area has been based for some time. Operations against Hama Rashid seemed to me fully justified and were approved by me with proviso that to be effective repression must be accompanied by concrete scheme of reforms. Persian army report occupation of Merivan with considerable loss to Hama Rashid's supporters in killed end captured and proposes trying to drive Hama Rashid from Baneh, Iraqi Government have been asked by Persian Government to arrest Hama Rashid if he takes refuge in Iraq. 2. We have evidence of Press Attachd to His Majesty's Embassy that Kurds in the Soviet area of Persia openly carry arms and talk of independence and that Persian officials there are powerless mainly because Soviet authorities will not allow Persian troops to be sent to Rezaieh in adequate numbers. This applies also to Mahabad where Qazi Muhammad seems to be the centre of Kurdish independence movement. 3. There is some evidence that when Jaf Kurds recently entered Persia from Iraq to graze their flocks local Persian Officer commanding who was subsequently backed up by General Officer Commanding Kurds behaved verybadly. I have spoken very seriously to Prime Minister and have urged him to impress on all Persian officers who have to deal with Kurds that any bad behaviour on their part may have most serious repercussions in ell parts of Persia and Kurdistan since the minorities who are ill-treated by their Government will naturally tend to seek support elsewhere. 4. Prime Minister is fully aware of delicacy of the problem and also of difficulty of restraining cruelty.and greed of the Persian military. He proposes to send to the scene of operations Minister without Portfolio, Fahimi who is reasonable and has experience as Governor of Azerbaijan and also one of the Kurdish deputies. Prime Minister declares his intention to promise reforms/...through these emissaries and says that but for the fact that he himself is liable to suspicion as a member of Turki speaking minority he would promise freedom to teach Kurdish in primary schools. 5. I hope to see Fahimi before he leaves for Kurd 4 istan w and to see he takes some sensible and humane ideas with him.

Audience of the Shah f August 29th, 1944, His Imperial Majesty said he thought that the new Saed Government - which indeed had not yet been formed, but would inevitably be the result of Majlis dictation - would be an unsatisfactory stop-gap affair and if anything even more incapable than its predecessor of arresting the general deterioration. 2. Meanwhile he was becoming daily more disturbed at the Russian attitude. he did not pretend that he had a first-rate intelligence service; ‘but an embryo organisation did exist, and was sending in very alarming reports. The gist of all these reports was that the Russians were going to get really busy in from three to four months from now; their idea being apparently on the critical last phase of the war in Europe. Pending this active stage, order had been issued for a general increase of contacts with all sections of the population. 3. What the ^hah particularly feared was a Putsch at Tabriz.^ he thought that, following the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the Kurds would be encouraged to descend on the settled population of Azerbaijan and create such insecurity as would oblige the population to ask for Russian protection. Ihe Persian forces would not be able to establish themselves in time to prevent this. When I pointed out that things had been much calmer in Azerbaijan during the last few weeks, his Imperial Majesty suggested that this was merely due to realisation by the Russians that they must not provoke the Persian Government into pressing their demand for permission to send adequate forces to the province while there was yet time. 4. The Shah said that, in the light of these fears, he had been reconsidering our former talk, and the necessity lor cringing a strong man to power. he had had two long discussions with Seyyed Zik^and had made much progress with him - so much, indeed that he was now convinced that he personally (his Majesty emphasised this ''personally” several times) would have very little difficulty in working with the Seyyed. There were of course various points on which he would have to obtain definite assurances from the latter. In the first place, he would have to be assured as to Seyyed Zia's religious programme: the priests were 'all royalist at heart' (sici) knowing.that Islam would not survive the monarchy; but he could not for a moment permit a return to a system in which the ulema took a direct hand in political affairs. The administration must remain laioue . Then again, he must know exactly how far the Seyyed proposed to interfere in army matters about which he knew nothing at all. And finally he must be satisfied that beyyed Zia would be prepared to argue and discuss policy, instead of taking the line that anything he said 'must necessarily be right and unquestionable. But after his recent discussions with Seyyed Zia he felt confident that the necessary assurance would in fact be forthcoming on these outstanding points. 5. It was however difficult to see how to bring the Seyyed to power without upsetting 'the whole apple-cart. What would be the reactions of (1) the 'intellectuals’, (2) the Majlis and (5) the Russians? Granted that Seyyed Zia was the only man capable stopping the rot, could he in fact be brought to power without precipitating the very disaster towards which the rot was leading the country. 6. I said that 1 did not know much about the 'intellectuals' in Persia, but believed them to be neither numerous nor politics 11 important. I was in no position to estimate with any certainty■bbhhm the extent to which Seyyed Zia could count on parliamentary backing. ^ de seemed to be definitely on the up-grade, but his enemies were I I powerful and vociferous. He must ooviously have such a pari- ^ iamentary backing if the constitution were to be upheld; and, if ^ it were not upheld, the Russians would be presented with just the pretext they needed. There was nothing to prevent the Shah from calling on Seyyed Zia to-morrow to form a Cabinet, but the Majlis, by a simple vote of no-confidence, could render the continuance in office of such a Cabinet unconstitutional. My own view was that, given the requisite parliamentary backing and the consequent preservation of constitutional legality, the Tudeh and the Russians would in all probability confine themselves to ,f loud noises off', and the latter, in my opinion, would'be hard put to it to find a pretext for a definite breach. (The ^hah had suggested that they might break off diplomatic relations)• They were people who generally accepted a fait accompli. But admittedly there was a considerable element of risk. 7. The Shah said he was very much afraid that the Russians would retaliate by stirring up really serious revolt in the Northern zone. Meshed, owing to the religious temper of its people, was probably safe; but the racial difference between the Azerbaijanis and the rest of the population constituted a permanent danger, and the hold of the Russians on the industrial populations of Mazanderan and ^ilan, particularly at bhahi, was extremely strong. He was even by no means sure of Tehran, where the Russians were quite capable of distributing arms to their followers and had been reported by some sources as already doing so. There remained Isfahan and the 'tribal Couth: he did not believe that the Couth would rise, as our -influence there was strong. As for Isfahan, he was taking his precautions against trouble; the 'surrounding districts' were to be disarmed - a start had already been maae with the Chahar Lang- and there would shortly be a comb-out for arms in the town itself. .(here I inter jected that it seemed to me very doubtful whether any section of the Bakhtiari would associate itself with a violently left -wing agitation obviously inspired by the Russians; but the ^hah swept aside this objection, asserting that Russian officers had been in close contact with the Chahar Lang of late and that none of the -Bakhtiari clans was at all reliable). 8. Reverting to the Northern -one, the Shah said that it r was quite intolerable that the Persian Government should be m prevented from asserting their autnority there. They had a perfect right to do so under the Tripartite Treaty, which expressly reserved the preservation of internal order for the Persian Administration. About a month ago, basing themselves on the treaty, the Persian Government had addressed a note to the Russians informing the latter of their intention to despatch a division to Razaieh. But nothing had come of it. 9. I asked *why not? f Had the Russians refused to allow it? The Shah admitted that they had not: they hadn’t, in point of fact, sent any reply. But in the first place 'that old maid Saed' was far too irresoltite to take any such step.; and in the second place mi11spaugh wouldn’t let the Government have the necessary funds (which had been calculated at about ten million tomans for a year) . ^uite apart from any such extraordinary expenditure, -there ' was already a deficit of some twenty million tomans' in respect of the Aimy. ihe ohah had proposed co cover this, and to gain about five millions besides for increased education, by raising slightly the price of rationed sugar. The population, which was at present El t§ hayinghaving to pay infinitely more for sugar on the black market, would hardly notice the difference, Mfllspaugh had promised to consider but had havered on without saying either yes or n o. 10, There followed the.usual tirade against Millspaugh, and the usual exposition of the needs of the Array, The Russians, he said, would have an easy time with the junior officers, whose pay was scandalously low. Something drastic must be done at once if the loyalty of the Army as a whole was to be conserved, 11, I asked whether the Shah had discussed the Millspaugh |question frankly with the new American Ambassador. He said he had, and had found Mr, Morris extremely sound and sympathetic - so much so, that he was now satisfied that the problem of the American jadvisers would right itself before long. (By this he appeared to mean that Dr. Millspaugh would be withdrawn, though I could not get him to admit this in so many words). 12, I said that, if the Shah and the Persian Government were convinced that it was necessary to despatch Persian troops into the Russian zone (which indeed seemed to me the obvious way of forestalling political trouble there of the sort ha had predicted), then it would surely be best to explain the financial difficulty frankly to Mr. Morris and seek his help. I did not know how far the Ambassador was capable of influencing Millspaugh in a matter of this sort, but nothing but good could come of a frank exposition of the Persian Government 1 s difficulties to the American authorities • 4 13• The Shah suggested that it would be difficult to complain to the American Ambassador about the conduct of a man who was a servant of the Persian Government and hence liable to dismissal by the latter if they did not find him satisfactory. I replied that one ought not to be too theoretical about such things: Mr. Morris must be supposed to have a certain influence over Dr. Millspaugh in practice, regardless of the theoretical position, and it seemed to me a pity not to try to work things that way instead of risking the estrangement of American public opinion by the drastic course of dismissal. If and when the milder method failed it would be time enough to consider the alternative. 14. Another grievance against Dr. Millspaugh which the Shah mentioned was that the former was jibbing at a proposal to return certain lands to the Shahsevan tribe. This tribe, the Shah said, were 100% loyal and a most valuable counterpoise to the Kurds; it was therefore cheese-paring economy to deny*them these lands. I put in a word here about the long delay in compensating the Bakhtiari khans, but it fell on barren soil - the Shan evidently does not care much for the Bakhtiari. 15. His Imperial Majesty continued to show a certain amount of suspicion of us in connection with the movement towards coalition among the southern tribes. He asked why we were 'having talks' with Naser Qashgai, a far more whole-hearted helper of the Germans than Naubakht. I replied that our only recent contact of any importance with Naser had been our abortive attempt to persuade him to stand for the Majlis - a move which, if it had succeeded, would have greatly helped the Persian Government by softening and emasculating this bumptious chieftain. In general, however, and in principle, I must emphasise that we had a perfect right to maintain contact with tribal leaders in zones of particular interest to us. His Imperial Majesty observed that, after some conference with General Wavell, Sir R. Bullard had assured him positively that the British/British would not support the tribes. I said the assurance had presumably been that we would not support the tribes against the Central Government. We had not done so, and were not doing so. When the Persian Government succeeded in settling the tribes and putting an end to the tribal problem, we should be delighted. But until that happened - and the Central Government obviously could not even begin to think of it for the present - we were obliged, for the protection of our vital interests, to maintain a certain amount of contact with the de facto rulers of districts not in practice submissive to the authority of Tehran. As for the innuendo regarding our different treatment of Naser Khan and Naubakht, we had no faith in the former and wcdd willingly have arrested him too; but he had a powerful tribe at his back and we should have had to conduct a war of our own, in Persian territory, to effect his arrest. I took leave to doubt whether His Imperial Majesty or any other Persian would have thanked us for doing so. In any case, we had had better uses for our troops. 16. The Shah, while appearing to accept this, added that he had received reports of the use of British arms and ammunition of recent date by the tribes. I pressed him for details, saying that there was always a small leakage going on and that consequently there was nothing surprising in such reports provided the quantity of material discovered were not large. It then emerged that His Imperial Majesty had been sent one 'cartouche’* of British make, date 1942, as a specimen; he couldn’t say where it had been found, nor how many more were alleged to have been found. I left him in no doubt that I didn't think this good enough, and that someone was obviously trying to make trouble between us. 17. The Shah still hankers after a senate, and hinted at the possibility of bribing members of the Majlis to agree to its creation. I quoted Macaulay on the relations between Charles II and the 'Pensionary Parliament': 'There is one thing*which even the most corrupt senates are unwilling to sell, and that is the power which makes them worth buying'.

Though the fault is his in part only, his personal position here is now past praying for.* 2) Black seems fairly competent and politically tactful. He has not yet fallen foul Of the Persian authorities who like to contrast him with Millspaugh; but if he inherited the latter's powers and obligations to control expenditure he would soon enough find himself up against the same powerful enemies, 3) United States Ambassador tells me that he has reached the conclusion that no official adviser ought to be given powers and responsibilities which were entrusted to Millspaugh since these stultify the Persian constitution and are basically incompatible with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter, Millspaugh or his successor in his view should share these powers with some Persian Minister answerable to Parliament - preferably Minister of Finance. All decrees should be signed jointly by both and in the event of disagreement the Prime Minister should decide between them. 4) Theoretically the drawbacks to this scheme are obvious. Persian incompetence and corruption are such that the adviser probably would often be overridden, yet as long as he were employed he'would be blamed in the usual Persian way for everything that went wrong. 5) On the other hand MilIspaugh's present powers are already to a large extent theoretical only. Under constant badgering and threat of ignominious dismissal he is now yielding to Majlis pressure against his own judgment (c.f. last sentence of paragraph 4 0 ^ my telegram No. 766) and various bills have recently been tabled which completely disregard his authority on the all-important question of wheat collection. 6) One way or another therefore the question of preserving so called '’Millspaugh set-up” in future does not really arise. United States Ambassador himself is against it* so are almost all influential Persians from the Shah downwards; and it has already been successfully undermined in practice. It remains to b Tte m IND'A 0 FF1CSaulMtoNi - 2 - be seen whether Black or and other [sic other] toerican would think it good enough to acpept invidious position of an adviser (or ^co-executive') liable to be ignored but certainly 'toibe blamed. There can, however, be no doubt that both m financial and economic matters - particularly Persians are sorely in need of foreign advice, and that they., will avert disaster only to the extent to which they accept such advice.

The fact of reconciliation is now widely known and has raised Seyyed Zia's stock, though many people doubt whether the Shah is playing straight. 2. During a long audience I had with the Shah on • August 29th, His Majesty, while less explicit than Seyyed Zia, declared that he was now satisfied that he would be able to work with the latter who he realised was the only man capable of arresting the deterioration of the administrative machine. He had however received many alarming reports about Soviet intentions, and could not see how Seyyed Zia could be ! brought to power without precipitating crisis. He v/as particularly apprehensive of a putsch in Azerbaijan when the Soviet troops withdrew: the Russians would, he feared, secretly incite the Kurds to attack the settled population who in turn would appeal to the U.S.S.R. for protection. Persian troops in adequate strength were not being allowed into | Azerbaijan now and would not be able to get there in time. 1 Calm which had succeeded the recent storms in that province was simply due to the Russian realisation that until the r ' moment arrived for this outsch they must give the Persians no excuse for pursuing their demand for permission to send troops. 3. On my pressing him further. His Majesty stated that Soviet authority had not reacted to a note addressed to them several weeks ago announcing the Persian Government's intention to send a division to Rezaieh. (My impression derived from most secret sources is that Moscow after much equivocation actually agreed to this). But Millspaugh would not produce the funds required. Nor would he consent; to other prophylactic measures such as the return of certain land to the'loyal Shahsevan tribe and increase in the pay of the junior'Army officers who were in such straits that their reliability was becoming very doubtful. I suggested as regards Millspaugh's attitude the matter should be discussed frankly with the United States Ambassador. Full report of the audience follows by bag.2 influential Persians are now convinced that the Russians intend to undermine the country's independence as soon as a favourable opoortunity presents itself, i.e. probably when attention' is completely distracted by European developments following on the collapse of Germany, I have not of course encouraged these fears (a useful •by-oroduct of which has been the Shah’s swing-over towards Sey'yed-Zia') but the actions of the Tudeh and the Russians are not calculated to dispel them, 'The former's attitude seems intended to stultify every measure making for political stabilisation, and independent sources confirm ; that there has recently been a dangerous increase of Russian subterranean activity particularly among the junior ranks of the army. 5. Seyyed Zia still believes that those elements of the Tudeh who are the least submissive to the Russian influence are alone preventing a renewal of that party's overtures to himself (s ee'my°teleg r am'No~ 72'8). ''He also believes however that if the Russians do wisn to or mg hi \ur4' u if the Russians do w'isn to bring him to the top it is only in order that he should have further to fall. - n r Foreign Office please pass to Government of India as my • telegram No. 277. __ r ies sent to Mr. Wiltshire and to Telegraph Branch# India Office for repetition to Government of India .

For the first time according to fairly reliable reports which I hope to have checked during the next few days, the Shah agreed (provisionally) to Seyyed's plans on all outstanding points of difference, i.e. to numerical reduction of the Army, strengthening of the gendarmarie and the retention of Millspaugh Mission in exchange for a great increase m Court budget. It was also agreed if ana when Seyyed came to power - and he himself does not consider the. time ripe yet - it should be on basis of a detailed programme agreed also between the Shah and himself. Seyyed's own idea (not yet put forward to the Shah) is that this programme should also be submitted to and passed by us and that we should agree to back v/hichever. party forms [?gp. omitted: ?government I have not discouraged this idea though not of c our 5 e committing ourselves to it. The Russians would not like it if they got wind of it; but they would anyhow have to either be squared beforehand or faced at the moment or Seyyed's taking office and would in either eventuality assume our concurrence in the programme whether we had in fact been consulted or not. 2. From a long conversation I have just had with Ala, it ife evident that this development is due (apart from our more open advocacy of Seyyed) to the increasing conviction of the Shah and his advisers that Tudeh cannot be appeased, and that the Russians are determined to create before the convening of the peace conference, a state of general chaos which would afford pretext for intergention 'at popular ^ request' in Azerbaijan for a start. Court now appears to regard Seyyed Zia. as the only hope of preventing this, but fears not without reason that he could not come to power 1 - — or&gt;o -to violent counter-measures. without provoking the Russians t Both directly and through Seyyed oc thft -nnssihilitv or our 'se Zia they have sounded us as 'to the possibility of our' Tl selling' the latter to the Russians before Saed^s stop-gap administration leads to still worse administrative disruption than exists already. 1/I have told- Ala that in ny opinion this could only he done at Moscow if, which I very much doubt, it could be done at all. 3 # I an seeing the Shah again on August 29th. 4. please pass to Government of India as my telegram No. 264. :; &gt; • • [Copies sent to Mr, Wiltshire and to Telegraph Branch, India Office], (OTP)[This telegram is of particular secredy anoj should retainei hy the authorised recipient and not passed on]/' - retainei [CYPHER] Ivir.

If the Ambassador had come with any instructions in that sense, he did not reveal the fact, and after nine days here he had evidently not begun to get down to this pressing problem. He seemed however to be impressed by our arguments and I think the conversation v/as useful. In particular he admitted the need for revising oolicy hitherto adopted by United States authorities whereby advisers nominated by them at the request of the Persians were left to fend almost entirely for themselves, and without guidance, as servants of the Persian Government. This was getting the worst of both worlds as Persian authorities never credited the United States Government with such [group undec.]ness.

Cn the contrary, I regard with great cone rn tlie unbridled licence of a very large pro portion of the Tehran press, and fear that, unless really serious steps are taken i ^mediately to impose a reasonable measure of control, this situation must sooner or later have a very damaging effect on the relations between our two countries* 3. &gt;ince His Majesty 1 * rabaseador last addressed you officially on the subject, several new and still more scurrilous papers have made their appearance. Of these, the 'harya”, which is openly hostile to the British Commonwealth, Is the worst but by no means the only serious offender. On three occasions I have felt obliged to protest rersonally to Your Uccellency at its violently'anti-British tone, but to the best of my knowledge no steps have yet been taken agninst its editor - who has now issued in booklet form, as his contribution to Angl/wirnnian solidarity, a partial reprint of KSrl Marx’s highly tendencious and out-dated 'British Buie in India'. This, I raav add, occurred several days after the receipt of Your excellency’s note under reference. 4. Many other objectionable newspaper articles have been brought to vour Excellency’s notice by His Majesty’s Ambassador and myself during the last few lonths, but to no effect. I will only mention here the vicious attack by the 4 )emavend' on T r. Trott - one of the best friends Iran ever had. 5. Nor can I agree with Your Excellency’ s suggestion that the vices of the Iranian press are attributable merely to its being ill-informed. Ill-informed it certainly is for the most part; but It is also ill-intentioned, end notoriously exists to a large extent on political and private blacknail. Upwards of sixty newspapers and periodicals are, I understand, published in Tehran alone, at time when newsprint is everywhere in short supply. In the almost complete absence of really reputable press organs for the guidance of public opinion, it would be the great est mistake to suppose that the influence on the Iranian population of the disreputable majority is unimportant. The public is being systematically taught by a large group of unprincipled journalists to regard Iran’s Miles - and particularly Great Britain - with Very/ distrust and caversion. This is clearly a/serious matter; and tay Government, who are well aware of it, are bound to bear it in mind when estimating the sincerity of the imperial Government s desire to collaborate in the common war effort of the United Nations. It is ray earnest hope, therefore, that in the Interest Iranian relations the measures to vftiich Your excellency alludes will prove really and immediately effective. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to ' our •Excel!oncy the assurance of my highest consideration. ^ His Excellency M.

United States Government may possibly consider that, since the position of their advisory laissions in j ere la is lively to become more rather than less difficult, they would do well to withdraw some or all of them while this can be done with ignity. rather than wait for the Persian Government to throw them out. In env case, it seems clear that they will be most reluctant to find any further staff for existing missions. We. on the other hand are most anxious that the jaerlcan missions should s'emiin and in oe tain cases be strengthened, since ire are convinced that Persia s need for foreign assistance will continue to be great for some ti.** to come, and particularly in the iiwdtate poot-enar period. 5. e are es *ei lly concerned about the future of the ersian police, hen Hied troops are withdraws, a largo __ measure of responsibility for internal security will f«ll on reforss cannot De i osiried out without foreign assistance in fers. sad we should prefer that this assist a neeshould be provided by United States if at all possible.

Millspaugh’s statements as reproduced.in 'Setareh” (a newspaper subsidised by Seyed Zia to support Millspaugh) of July 28th were tactless even by his own standards. He said amongst other things that the United States was the only country which had ever championed Persia*s freedom, and that if his Mission had not been present in Persia one of three things would have happened: 4 t. . iX ... ' ‘ ' • * (a) disturbances leading to occupation of North and South Persia by Russians and British respectively (b) occupation of the country by an International Force (c) a dictatorship even more rigorous than Reza Shah s. 2. The Soviet Ambassador (who, like myself, had been av/aiting in vain a reaction from Millspaugh to the storm of press criticism and some more [i*. groups undec. ] mis-reported) proposed to me two days ago that we should make a joint demarche to United States Charg6 d'affaires asking whether he considers [grp, undec: ? these] issues of an American official [sic] were compatible with the spirit of the Tehran Declaration, and whether if not he would arrange for Millspaugh to retract them publicly. I declined, feeling that such an assault on the Americans was a poor way of demonstrating an Anglo-Soviet solidarity for which the Soviet authorities here had hitherto shown little desire; but I undertook to remonstrate privately with Mr. Ford. When I did so I found him most embarrassed. He said he had already written to Millspaugh to enquire whether he had really made the remarks attributed to him, but he had little doubt of it. He thought the State Department had been awaiting^ just such a pretext for recalling Millspaugh and that unless k. retracted he was ’’finished’*.

United States ChargS d 1 affaires had evidently reached the conclusion that hillspaugh, quite apart from his constant political blunders, was not doing a sufficiently good job to be worth fighting for. This opinion is shared by the Commercial Secretary to this Embassy who thinks even the Persians would be more successful in matter of distribution if left to &gt; . themselves (see my telegram No. 766 _paragraph X) but not by Financial Counsellor who still^considers the withdrawal of the mission, unless it were adequately replaced, would mean financial chaos. * h.

Charg^ d'Affaires stated in general the United States Government were extremely irritated by the lack of practical Persian co-operation with the existing American advisory missions, some or all of which might well be withdrawn before long. Persian fear of men in uniform made them treat Ridley and^ Schwortzkopf with more respect than civilians, but^the United States Government and the State Department in particular doubted whether any American adviser was [grp.undec. ? receiving] enough co-operation to justify his remaining. 3. As regards a successor for Timmerman (police) no request had been received from the Persian Government out if the request of adviser were received the United States Government would insist on most categorical assurances of full co-operation from the Persian authorities. They realised moreover that the eventual successor would have to be provided with an adequate staff, and it was extremely doubtful whether suitable men could in fact be produced. (Please see my letter of July 21st to Hankey). f Similarly while they had no objection in principle to Schwortzkopf s taking over the police as well as the gendarmerie they could not spare the [grp.undec. ? 5] picked men for whom he had asked. 4. In [grp.undec.] fact Millspaugh, who has already had one month of his 'probationary' four appears to be accomplishing absolutely nothing which would justify his continued retention in the public eye. Inadequate Persian co-operation is not the only reason: he seems 'paralysed', and commodities are simply not being distributed. Rather than face Majlis opposition he has just lus grain direct r: proposals though at for collecting surplus grain direct from his suggestion I had taken the matter Uj? withdrawn peasants ( strongly with the Prime Minister) and this in expert Britisl opinion may quite possibly lead to a serious shortage since the Ss fMO A .

'• • ‘ ’ Seyed Zia has sent-, the following message, through an • unofficial British intermediary:.- . (a). Tudeh leaders who- have .for some time past been courting him secretly (as we have been told [gp. undec: ?by him] before) have now definitely proposed ,, coalition ,, with himself as Prime Minister and 50&gt;o Tudeh membership of the Cabinet, \ They- say, that as they have Russian backing and presume he has His : Male sty’s Government ’ c., clearly nobody could stand against such a combination, which would :: have power to get things done and would relieve Persia of Anglo-Soviet rivalry. • . (b) He suspects a trap i.e. intention to discredit him to office under circumstances he suspects a trap i politically by bringing him t that would render it impossib impossible for him to achieve anything. (c) Nevertheless he believes himself sufficiently strong to take this risk in the hope of being able to turn the tables on Tudeh and is prepared to accept their offer if we promise him moral•support or possibly even if-we are neutral. (d) He y/ould indeed prefer Mo reject the offer and remain out or office for the present, building up his following with a view to later assumption of office unhampered by commitments to Tudeh. But as funds of his wealthy supporters are nearly exhausted, he could achieve nothing by adopting this course unless he received '''material” support from us. .(e) Tudeh have'offered to put him in touch with the Russians but- he : wants our advice: first. 2. r • .If [gp. undec: ?Tudeh] offer were genuine, it would indeed present very substantial advantages. 'The Prime Minister was ineffective even before the Mlllspaugh crisis, in v/hich he took the wrong side, and the upshot of which has greatly v/eakened his position, A number of equally futile and/or more [gp. undec.] political hacks (including even Sohei[gp, unaec.]) are now being tipped to replace him. Unless the country can get out of this rut, spread of f administrative paralysis appears inevitable and this among other ill-effects would finally sink Millspaugh mission.3. It is, however, much more likely, as Seyed Zia suspects, that Tudeh offer is made in [gp. undec: ?had] faith. ^Their attacks on him have been most venomous, and in view of their attitude towards Millspaugh, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that their militarist hackers are actuated by the desire to keep the country in a state of ulceration until Persian Azerbaijan - if not Persia itself - can be absorbed •’at popular request'. It is at least doubtful whether Seyed zia’s confidence in his ability to out manoeuvre them is justified, though, his position has certainly been considerably strengthened of late. Since nothing will persuade the Persians: that he is not our man, his downfall would be popularly regarded as a prestige defeat for us. 4. If he refused the opposition of Tudeh and the Russians would become still more violent,'but this would not necessarily weaken his position on balance and it may be that even without subsidies from us - which seem prima facie most undesirable - he could eventually build up that position enough to'become a really powerful and useful force. 5. You will no doubt be consulting His liaiesty’s Ambassador [?gp. omitted]. Subject to your instructions I would propose to reply on the following lines: (1) We.could not contemplate subsidising him since that would constitute a really unjustifiable interference in Persian- internal affairs.

This decision was taken by Road Transport Board backed by American and British Embassies. Owing to failure to appoint successor to Persian Chairman who was given a post abroad, Road Transport Board now consists exclusively of .American and British member Sc §. Upon receiving report about this from American Charge d’affaires, State Department expressed complete under standing of action approved [sic ? taken] but asks whether similar action has been taken in respect of goods imported by U.K.C.C. Charge d'Affaires has agreed with me to reply to the effect that U.K.C.C* goods are not concurrently held, up because (1) They are paid for by Persian Government cash against documents. (2) Persian Government are not paying for Lend-Lease material and show every intention of trying to get it for nothing in return for alleged services and sufferings in Allied cause. (5) allocation of Lea.^e-Lend lorries was only begun because Persian Government accepted Allied control of Road Transport through Road Transport Board. 3. It is the film opinion of this Embassy and of United States Embassy that whatever happens to Mill.. Mission there must be Allied control both of allocation of motor transport tyres and spares in this country and of use of motor transport for essential goods since otherwise this material which might be of great value elsewhere will be largely wasted through inefficiency and corruption. 4.

Gardener has 6berf staying with me on his way home, and I am able to ada two points ^hfeh he mentioned to me. i. Gardener reports that Ala, in the course of a general conversation, stated that the British were supporting Saiyid Zia. Gardener of course denied this stoutly. As I have assured Ala more than once that we are not supporting Saiyid Zia, this news was disturbing, for although I have no doubt that Ala would take this line with the Persians, I did not think that he would make such a statement to one of His Majesty's Consular officers. I tackled Ala about it to-day. He pretended that all he had said was that there was a general impression among Persians that we were support ing Saiyid Zia; of course be accepted my assurance; and so on. But I am sure he was lying. His education in England, while it has not taught him to tell the truth, has made it impossible for him to feel quite comfortable when lying to English people. I have since consulted Gardener again, and he is quite certain that Ala accused the British of supporting Saiyid Zia. I have no doubt that this is the Shah's opinion too. He still regards Saiyid Zia as an enemy of the Pahlevi dynasty. ii. It was clear to Gardener that Ala was desperately anxious that some improvement in conditions should follow immediately on the Shah's visit and be attributed to the Shah. Ala said to Gardener with horror that the local people were complaining that v/hereas they were used to eating pure wheat bread, they were now being given bread with an admixture of barley. Gardener said that Shiraz bread was 80,5 wheat and 20?a barley whereas in Bushire the X&gt;osition was reversed: did Ala propose that Bushire should eat all barley bread while Shiraz ate bread made of unadulterated wheat? Ala could not say yes when the situation was put to him bluntly, but he seems to have gone to the local representative of the Bread and Cereals Section and to have ordered him to issue pure wheat flour in future. The representative consulted Gardener who advised him to obey the oraers of his superiors in Tehran. Ala spoke to me, before I had seen Gardener, of the*sufferings which the people of Shiraz had to undergo in not being able to get xmre wheat bread. I said that hardly anyone in the Middle East or in the United Kingdom got pure wheat bread in these days and that the Shiraz people might well put up with this slight drawback for the general good. I have always advised the Shah to visit the provinces and in an interview which I had with him on May 22nd I praised his enterprise ana urged him to visit Kennanshah and Hamadan. I also expressed the hope that he would visit the Gulf area. Prior was with me and made a case for paying more attention to that part of the Shah's dominions. I am writing about that separately. I am sending a copy of this letter to Jakins, and a copy of the letter and its enclosures to Caroe. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) R. Bullard. \ C.W.

They are on the whole pleased with the visit to Pars and with the improved tribal situation - even although ITasir did not come to see Shah.

Yours ever Chancery, British Embassy Tehran.DIARY OF SHAH’S VI3X1\ May Shah left Tehran for Isfahan and Shiraz with large suite and escort. ilay 7th, 19.44^ Shah, after lunching at Abadeh with Umid Salar, (where latter ^ exploited his position as host to further his desire for election) arrived at Takht—i—Jamshid (Persepolis) in the evening. La^o that evening he went for a walk in the moonlit ruins communing with the spirits of the past. Thinks he is the first Shah to have^ slept*in the ruins since its destruction by Alexander in B.C.331* M f d Husain Khan and Khosrow Khan went there to greet Shah in name of Nasir Khan who, in absence of British guarantee,- preferred not to go in person. May 8th. At request of G. O.G. I went to Persepolis to greet Sh&amp;h. Had lunch with suite and afterwards was formally presented to Shah. Before lunch, 'talked with suite who expressed great pleasure at the reception in Isfahan, especially oecause the factory workers lined road as Shah passed. ihey had, apparently, expected hostile reception. Suite generally expressed disapproval of Seyid Zia, some of them going so far as to accuse him of aggravating political situation in Tehran (oi which uhey were apprehensive) by forming anti-Tudeh party.* Query - would they prefer him to join forces with Tudeh? t Suite also expressed great interest in tribal question. * Was asked to meet Hajhir, and explain to him my views. I said I could only repeat plan which -Embassy had already proposed to the Persian Government. Hajhir, while making it clear^ tnai, the plan had not yet been accepted, agreed that something aad to be done about the tribes, and was very interested in the Embassy f s proposal. His chief difficulty, however, was to accept a state of affairs in which the tribes would, as he put it be given a state of semi or complete autonomy. In conversation with me he arrived at no decision on this point, but was still exuloring the possioilities. While on the subject of tribes, I should mention that several of the suite expressed surprise that Nasir Khan had not appeared in person. Acting Governor General showed me telegram in which Qawam explained that he had not comemth Shah because he had not been informed of Shah T s visit to Shiraz. lactiul enquix'ies from suite showed a considerable volume of opposition to Qawam. After lunch, the Shah visited the sugar factory at Marvdasht, and Bandamir, and in the evening reached ^biraz a o-ood li hours late on his programme. At the entrance to the town fthe site of -the vandaftously destroyed zir Quran), he was met by guard of honour, and an address of welcome was read by Huaddil - newly elected deputy. T-hrough streets lined;with people and school children, he came to Abul Husain JDehkan s house (elder brother of deputy) where he was to stay. hej - e &gt; the senior Persian officials and their wives, my ui,fe and ±, and the members of the Consulate were gathered. The Shan did seem too pleased when I introduced my staff to him, but equally he appeared to have no pleasure in meeting his own officials. It is, perhaps, worth recording that as we all went bacx on (-foot to the.. • •foot to the Consulate, the crowd, gathered round us, cheered and threw hunches of flowers at us. I should say that the Shah appeared to have 'been warm3^ welcomed. How much people turned out for the sake of the lj&amp;w and how much to express loyalty is, however, difficult to say. A point worth mentioning is that four or five aircraft (mostly Moths) flew perilously low over the royal procession during its progress through the town. From the aircraft, coloured pamphlets welcoming the Shah were thrown out, hut no allowance appears to have oeen made for the boisterous wind, and the aim v/as therefore shockingly had. May 9th* At 10a.m. my wife, in the company of the leading ladies of Shiraz, was received hy the Malika. She reports as follows: 'The whole atmosphere was very funereal. At 10a.m. I arrived and was ushered into a room where about 30 ladies were sitting stiffly on chairs around the walls, and talking in hushed whispers. As. I entered, they all stood up and bowed - evidently thinking I was the chief mourner. We waited there for about 20 minutes,'and at intervals Madame Jehanbani came in to report progress. At 10.20 we silently filed upstairs, being received on the half landing by a tall dignified man - evidently the chief undertaker - v/ho pointed silently to a doorway through which we trailed, taking up our positions in a circle round the walls. No corpse - but two tables laden with fruit and oranges. At about 10.30 Her Majesty arrived, followed by Mme. Jehanbani and a pekinese. One of the ladies made a speech of welcome in a very halting style, stopping at intervals and looking round for a prompter. Her Majesty said a few words in reply, and then made the tour of the circle, the ladies being introduced by Mme. Jehanbani She, unfortunately,-so she herself told me later - forgot many of the names, so there was much mumbling. Her Majesty then retired; we looked hopefully at the cakes and oranges, but were firmly ushered downstairs and out of the house'. Press unite this a.m. in welcoming Shah and in pointing out the deficiencies of the local administration and the sufferings caused to the population thereby. In particular, they draw the Shah’s attention to the lack of security and threatened famine(. f ) The Shah, may construe this as an attack on him as, judging by the remarks of various of his suite yesterday, he is deeply sen sitive to, and cannot understand press remarks impugning his good faith and desire to ameliorate the conditions of his people. At noon I was received by H.M. in the presence of Ala and Hajhir. The Shah spoke at great length, but made no points of interest. He .insisted on need for Anglo-Iranian friendship, and hoped that after war our contacts would be increased both in the commercial and cultural spheres. Need in Iran would be democratic country for strict application of laws to all, rich and poor. He made specific mention of tribes, stating that existence of armed tribes v/as negation of democratic life, as leaders of such tribes are not justiciable by ordinary courts. He said that he was fully aware that the tribes had no confidence in the Government, and were probably justified. Plans must be made to inspire them with / confidence based on equity and strict application of lav/, but not by force, to which he was opposed except in the last resort. I said that I understood his Government was studying a project for .sed- entarisation of the tribes, to which he replied that he had heard of it, but perhaps sedentarisation was not the correct v/ord to use. Later, however, he spoke of the need of g r Ivihg Govt, land to (individual tribesmen..individual tribesmen, but not leaders. He then invited my views on the local situation. I said that during the last six or seven months the situation as regards security had improved greatly, and that recently Nasir had renewed his promises to the G.O.C. to stop pillaging etc. Asked about Anglo-Iranian collaboration, I replied that our relations here were very cordial. The Shah constantly made little speeches about the •need for good Anglo-Iranian relations, now and after the war, and the necessity for strict application of the law if Iran was to take the place she should alongside the democratic nations. Afternoon . Colonel Barker (American), Fov/ler and Henry were invited to a parade of troops organised for Shah. Fowler is reporting separately, but seems unfavourably impressed. Evening . A garden party -was given in aid of victims of Gorgan earthquake.• This had been arranged to take place earlier, but was postponed on receipt of news of-Shah’s arrival. Entrance charges were doubled and everyone given to understand that Shah was to be present. He was too tired to come. At night there was a display of fireworks.* On the evening of May 9th. Shah, with no formality visited poor quarters of town. He entered houses and encouraged people to state their grievances. When discussing this later, he was visibly moved (shedding tears) and declared that the gulf between the poor and the rich was intolerable. M*d Husain Qashgai in conversation this evening said that Shah, both at Persepolis and at Shiraz had shown great interest in tribes and expressed sympathy for their grievances. He asked repeatedly what they wanted. In particular he said that the Shah, like other people, had enemies and needed friends. Among those traditionally friendly to the Shah were the tribes, and he (Shah) now needed them. M’d Husain states that he replied in vague terms, stating that the tribes had always distinguished between the Shah and the Government, and, while • detesting the latter, had no grievance against the Shah. They wanted only his kindness and interest in them. M’d Husain thinks the Shah intends offering the Qashgai Government appointments, and asked my views. I said I could give no reply- to that point. May 10th. f Shah visited sights and schools of Shiraz. Again fireworks in the evening. Crowds gather outside Shah’s residence and cheer every time he appears. I think enthusiasm must be genuine and not the work; of paid claques. May 11th. » Two very well-informed people give me the following information: (a) That Ala, Shoku ul Mulk, Hajhir and the•Qaraguzlus are collecting as much information as possible on the 4&gt;ribes. (b) The same people are making enquiries as to improvements in provincial Government. They envisage the resumption of -provincial councils, but more particularly the changing of the present system of appointing officials as Governors. They are enquiring as to the advisability of appointing people of family as Governors and giving them wide powers. The suite say /this has already...mw b &lt; this has already heeD done with Mansur(?) in Khorassan* (c) Malika is busy this morning supervising the distribution of cloth etc. to the poor of Shiraz. (&amp;) That when divines were received by Shah, they all ^ refused t© attend if the notorious Seyid Nur ed Din were pr^ .ent. Informed of situation,^received Nur ed Din standing, and will receive to-morrow other divines sitting. is good that ranks of other divines are closed against Nur ed -^in. (e) They have no needs of discussions regarding elections for remaining three seats, but believe they are proceeding. (f) Shah is expressing pleasure at his visit to Shiraz, and has decided to prolong it until li+th May. To-day he goes shooting (ibex etc.) with Jehanbani. May 12th. r ^ ' Q Shah did usual sightseeing. manoeuvres to be held at Pul-i-Fasa on 13th. They are reporting separately. In the evening I called on Ala at his request. The interviev/ lasted two hours b-qt turned chiefly on the Shah’s position. Ala betrayed great concern over what he called the repeated and unjustified attacks on the Shah in the Press (notably Ra’ad) and other quarters, be spoke openly with | great hostility against Seyed Zia, describing him as an aspiring dictator with reactionary tendencies - i.e. the Seyed wishes to return to the veiling of women, priestly influence etc, whereas the Shah desires a modern, efficient and democratic etc Iran .* Then Ala said that many British people (even Sir W.Smart in Cairo) considered that the Shah had fallen under Russian influence presumably because of the recent Russian offer of military material. He wished to reassure me that this was not the case. When the offer was made the Shah felt unable to refuse i it.but when conditions (I understood mixed brigades) were attached the Shah had directed his government to turn the offer down. During the interviev/ Ala made several anti-American remarks, expressing the view that Millspaugh was letting the Shah dov/n % At the end of the interview I remarked to Ala that I v/as somewhat surprised that during the Shah’s visit no British officer or official had been invited to any of the functions and that no member of the suite had even sent a card to this Consulate. Ala apologized and said that the omission was not intentional. Hay 13th Ala returned my visit and I introduced Jakins v/ho had arrived during my interview with him the previous evening. Two Qaraguzlus and Pirnia called. At 7 p.m* v/ith Jakins called on Hajhir at the Ustandari to discuss tribal settlement plan. He seemed convinced of the necessity for some such plan and disposed to try and put it into In the evening Johnson and Q.uilliam (l.B. I.) defeated the Shah and Qawami (A. I.O.C. Abadan) at tennis in tv/o straight t sets. ' n Later invitations were sent to Fowler and Henry to attend /effectMS effect. He stressed the need at once to get sugar, tea and piece goods to the tribes (and villages) but did not have a crack at Dr. Millspaugh. He said he had found a way round his previous objection to a separate tribal administration, which J suffered from the defect of appearing to recognize the tribes as a separate entity from the people of Persia. He would call it the ' Land Settlement Administration ! or some such name. Speaking of elections he said that as a result of his discussions he thought the best plan would be for Nasir to be elected for Abadeh and, as a face saving device, Malek Mansur for Firuzabad, by that the latter should resign leaving probably Rezavi as deputy. As for Jahrum he would leave it entirely free even if the result were that Hazaqi were elected. As regards the deadlock at Lar, he had interviewed a body of Palamarzi t s partisans and told them Government would and could not intervene to secure their man’s election. The votes had been cast, there was no proof of malpractice and therefore there was nothing to do but to stand by the count which must be made at once. He added that he load asked the G.O.C. to send Himmat to secure order during the count. That night with staff attended a play etc. Although I was detained by Hajhir and arrived late I was given suitable place. May 1hth. Hajhir and Governor returned our calls in the office. Shah doing usual sightseeing. He leaves for Tehran to-morrow but arrangements, have been made before his departure to see Colonel Barker, American military adviser.-jm wm wm %AZ‘ Copies to?

I fear that these enemies have been encouraged by the Imperial Government who, on the one hand, decided that the statement of tf.Hajhir about his visit to Tendon should be made in a secret session and, on the other, have neither made a statement about the object of the visit nor attempted to defend His Majesty’s Govern ment against the false accusations which are being made. \s you are aware, there was nothing calling for secrecy in M.

Note reminded the Persian Government that the United States Government only assented to the engagement of Millspaugh and his assistants because the Persian Government insisted and undertook to support them. Object was not to provide political buffer but to afford'economic assistance. Note says atmosphere of harmony essential and if the Persian Government do not want assistance United States Government do not intend to press it on them. 2. I understand that in their reply the Persian G overnment declare they have given full support to Dr.Millspaugh. This is untrue. It also denies ’’political buffer” suggestion, though according to the United States Charge d 1 Affaires it was Saed himself who said some time ago that the main object of the Persian Government in engaging American Adviser was to have a political buffer between Great Britain and Russia. Whatever Saed said I think it unfortunate that the United States Government should have referred to this in an official note which was bound to become public. 3. Cabinet showed to representative [grp.undec.? copies of] the American note and the Persian draft reply. Various papers had published statements that the American note was threatening and contained statement that the United States Government would consider as opposition to themselves any opposition to the Millspaugh mission. These false statements were disposed of in a debate in the Majlis June 1st. Nevertheless the principal speaker Abdoh, one of the members for Tehran, while admitting that there was nothing threatening in the American note considered that even the reproaches it contained were out of place and after expressing gratitude for American help in the past he ended with a declaration that wlen their rightful sovereignty was menaced Persians forgot even friendship. INDIA OFFICE!t 4 # We &gt; are trying to persuade the Persian Government t(T await the arrival of new United States Ambassador and are making the most of arguments in Millspaugh’s favour, e.g., that prices have hardly risen at all during the last six months and that corruption, lack of co-operation and mal-distribution have been worst precisely where until recently Millspaugh was unable to function i.e. m the North.

Russian authorities are giving contracts for improvement of Astara-Resht-Karsvin road. According to Persian Prime Minister they describe it as necessary to expedite aid to Russia and justify making of Astara-Resht section by their desire to avoid sea transport. It is difficult to understand why they should take this decision so late in the day and why their specifications should be for a much more expensive and solid surface than we used for roads for which we v/ere responsible. It may be that as the end of the war approaches they begin to realise that v/hereas in the South we and the Americans have carried out many important works of public utility their ov/n record in the North has been one of exploitation rather than development. 2. Many Persians regard this road scheme with astonishment because they cannot realise that if Russians ever wished to re occupy North Persia the existence' or absence of a road v/ould not make much difference.

Apart from the outcry against Hillspaugh Mission, he is being attacked for Appointment of Reza Afshar as Governor General Isfahan b. Presentation of a bill designed to eocure exceptional powers for the Government. 2. Tension in Isfahan factories between owners and work people and between parties among work people themselves became serious and the Governor General resigned, The^Prime Minister appointed Afshar after reports that we had nothing against him bui the appointment has been widely attacked on the ground^that Afshar received sentence for corruption under the lute regime including permanent deprivation of the right to hold public office. 5. It was mainly the Isfahan troubles which induced the Cabinet to table [grp.undec.] clause bill giving the Cabinet authority so long as Persia is at war, a. To treat state officials in the same way as military personnel. b. To subject factories, whether state or private, to a similar military regime c. To compel or forbid to live in a given place any person who acts against war interests of Persia or her allies or who disturbs or tries to disturb public order. The bill has had bad press and is unlikely to become law. * * T. : it/ WDiA OFFICE iIt has been suggested in some quarters that Saed is a oat's paw whose business is to get the bill passed and then to retire in favour of a dictator. This groundless suggestion is perhaps part of campaign against Seyed Zia whose newspaper at first praised the bill.

According to a statement made to me in confidence by the American Chargfe d*Affaires he has recommended the speedy ^ removal from Persia of two incompetent employees of the mission and of Br. lallspaugh’s son, an ill-mannered interfering youth of 18, whose contribution to the ecpnomic recovery of Persia has been to crash two official Persian cars. Apart from this there is the question, which even some honest as well as able people are asking, whether Dr. ilillspaugh is equal to his task in the greatly expanded form it has assumed since his^ arrival. He came to advise on finanpe but he is now practically director of the financial and economic affairs of the country. 3. The main charges are that (1) he acts without sufficient consultation and so maxes grave avoidable mistakes (2) he delays urgent business by trying to do everything himselr (3) instead of concentrating on the control of essential articles tea, sugar and piece goods he has tried to control a large amount of goods with the result that in some cases the control is ineffectual and in others it strangles such benefit of action taken as there might otherwise have been. 4. My own relations with Dr. Millspaugh have been excellent and he has shown a very reasonable attitude towards Middle East Supply Centre groups undec:] above mentioned charges. American Chargd d’Arfaires is beccming anxious for he does /does not see how the required consent from the Russians is to^r secured while Dr. Millspaugh has little or no support among the Persians. One suggestion-which has been made toihe American: Ghargfe d'affaires is that Dr. Millspaugh should confine .himself to work for which he was originally engaged and should hand over nis economic functions to some other American e.g. Dr. Black, fomer head of the Faim Credits Association who arrived recently to take charge of the_bread and cereal section. One powerful group however, including a number of deputies, is detemined to get rid of Dr. Millspaugh alleging that^it would pay Persia to give a much higher salary to some American who knew the job. 5. In spite of qualms about Dr. Millspaugh in his relation not to us but to the Persians and to his own staff we have given him full support. Moreover I know how difficult it would be to raise the question of his competence with United States Government without appearing to be weakening in our support of changes in advisers m general and perhaps exposing ourselves to the charge of obstruction. It is not possible however that the United States Government should not have received criticisms of Dr. Millspaugh from their Embassy here and from Americans who have left the staff of the Millspaugh Mission and they ought therefore to understand that if asked whether, in view of the continued attacks on Dr. Millspaugh, the United States Government were convinced, we could safely press the Soviet Government to gice full support to the American advicer without making sure that there was nothing in the criticisms that called for examination. f 6.

AS the elections are not yet over in some parts of the country I am not in a position to report fully on the composition of the 14th Majlis; the following notes on the present position may, however, be of interest. i 2. By the 2nd April the election of 108 Deputies had been announced, leaving 28 results to come, mostly from Azarbaijan (including Tabriz) and Fars. Of the 108 Deputies so far elected the certificates of election of 83 have been passed by the Majlis; the certificate of election of one Deputy, Habibullah Durri from Darajaz, has been rejected. 3. Of the 108 Deputies 40 were members of the 13th Majlis, 32 having been re-elected for their old constituencies and 8 elected for different ones. Among the old members re-elected are Dr. Taheri, Amir Taimur, Naraqi, Behbehani, Ali Dashti and Tehranchi. The notorious trouble-maker, Majid —^ Muwaqqar, has not so far secured re-election, nor has the reactionary business man, Nikpur. Among the new Deputies are several well-known personalities ! such as Sayyid Zia-ud-Din, Tabatabai, Sayyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai and * \ Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq, and, apart from the Tudeh, a number of compara- 4 tively young men of the professional classes. 4. The usual groups have been formed among the Deputies who have preached Tehran and account for about two-thirds of them, the rest considering themselves “ independents.” With the exception of the Tudeh none of these 71 [52—76]groups possess principles, discipline or cohesion, and I need not trouble you with a detailed account of them. The Tudeh group at present numbers eight: Iskandari (Sari), Fidakar (Isfahan), Gunabadi (Sabzawar), Kambakhsh (Qazvin), Khalatbari (Babul), Kishawarz (Pahlavi), Radmanish (Lahiian) and Shahab Firdowsi (Firdowsj, 5. The Majlis has so far done nothing but discuss the certificates of election of its members and offer confused and unhelpful advice to M. Sa’id on the composition of his Government. Since there are so many new Deputies anxious to attract attention it may be expected that the 14th Majlis will be notable for the volume of its oratory, 6. I shall report in detail on the composition of the Majlis when the elections are completed. 7. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Government of India, and to the Minister Resident in the Middle East.

IMPORTANT. ££££££ After an absence of a week visiting His Majesty's Consulates at Hamadam and Kemanshah during which time I had no news of what was happening in Tehran I find situation here much worse. Saed has, it is true, obtained vote pf_confidence by a good majority but this is no evidence of stability, Razmara has again oecane Chief of General Staff and Prime Minister who agrees that he is unsuitable if only because he is an incorrigible intriguer, does not seem to know exactly how this came about. Two disquieting symptoms are attacks on Dr, Millspaugh and his ^ mission (my_ fte] eg ram Nn. H96) and serious deterioratiorTTn tone of Press in general. Tudeh campaign against Saiyid Zia becomes more and more violent and papers not overtly connected with them frequently speaking of him as tool of a master who is obviously meant to t)e His Majesty’s Government. 2. Prime Minister to whom I spoke about unpleasant references to us and scurrilous attacks on Americans, said that he had already arranged to warn the editors and that if they proved ( recalcitrant he would take severe measures, but I doubt his ability to restrain the Press which like the deputies is behaving with typical irresponsibility. I need haraly say the only references to Russia which appears in the Press are flattering. Prime Minister agreed when I suggested that if Press continued as at present, in six months Persian public might well believe that British and Americans were their enemies and Russians there only friends. 5. I hear confidentially that Persian Ambassador at London sends hardly any reports to Tehran and those of no importance. It would be well if he could see someone in the Foreign Office and hear something about his own country of which he is I fear very ignorant. He might pass it on to his Government.

The charges had nothing to do with the election but with his share in coup d'elat of 1921 and were therefore probably out of order but this point was never raised. Two Tudeh deputies had also filed a motion against Sayyid Zia but withdrew in favour of Musaddiq. No deputy ventured to support Sayyid Zia openly but in secret ballot he secured 57 votes out of 86. This is a defeat for the Shah and the Tudeh i.e, Rusaias but much dirty linen some of it alleged to be ours was washed and questions aroused which it would have been better to leave sleeping. The main accusation against Sayyid Zia was that it was with our help that he effected the coup d elat. He denied this with the aid of many quotations from documents and claimed that it was effected without; our knowledge. He also pointed out that the discussions might strike at the base of the present dynasty. 2. Outside Majlis there was an enormous crowd of supporters of the respective parties. It was eventually dispersed with the aid of a fire hose but not before the windows of Sayyid Zia s car had been smashed. Foreign Office please pass to Government of India as my telegram No. 78.

The Prime Minister would normally resign when credentials of all deputies have been verified i.e. after two or three weeks but he may resign at once to show his readiness to submit to Parliamentary control. The Minister of Commerce and Industry did not dar to face the Majlis and has presented his resignation so frequently that it has been accepted at last. He still denies having killed a workman and gives as grounds for his resignation that Doctor Millspaugh will not provide funds for munition factories which are making arms for Soviet Government. Millspaugh in an interview with Press alludes to factories (particularly those making munitions) which always have a deficit and expect Treasury to make it up; these he said must be made self-supporting, 5, The Shah has made further movement towards control of army by issuing orders through his nominee in place of Minister of War, and without knowledge of Chief of General Staff for transfer of Under Secretary for War and several other changes designed to isolate Chief of General Staff who in consequence feels more and more helpless since an increasing number of officers in key positions are now henchmen of the Shah and Razmara and hostile to Anerican Advisers, There is good evidence that the Shah has recently talked violently against Ridley and Millspaugh because they will not support his schemes for a Larger army.

Prime Minister asked me today what I thought of a proposal made by Dr. Millspaugh that an American oil expert named Clapp should be engaged by Persian Government for a period of 5 to 6 months at dollars 100 per diem to advise oh oil policy. Millspaugh had sounded Clapp who was prepared to come. According to the Prime Minister, Clapp was employed by Persian Government in 1927 and by the Amiran Concession Company in Persia in 1933, 2. I said that in view of keen competition that might arise between British and American companies, Clapp’s position as adviser to Persian Government might be very invidious, but that as oil experts in the world were probably rare I could not take it on myself to advise against the employment of Clapp especially as we had always supported the principal of engagement of American advisers by Persian Government. 3.

It is to be noted that the Khizi who is one of the candidates is the man I mentioned as having made an anti- British speech in connection with Saiyid Zia in Tabriz. I have already given my opinion that the new Soviet Ambassador will not come to Tehran until after the elections. He was appointed some four months ago; the Embassy were informed that he would start on a given day; and his baggage apparently once got as far as Baku. Meanwhile Maximov the Charge d’Affaires, who knows the country well and is a clever chap, is doing his best to 'arrange” the elections. He took a strong line about the bad Governor-General of Tabriz, Mugaddam,whom he refused to allow the Persian Government to remove. Eventually the Persian Government complained to the Soviet Government through their Ambassador in Moscow and Maximov apologised and withdrew. If the Prime Minister had the courage to complain to Moscow about the elections Maximov might again be given a nominal rap over the knuckles, but mean while Jie would have got several Tudeh candidates into the C.W #•X • I-jO Q * 9 Yours sincerely, (Signed) R. Bullard Foreign Office.m Since sending you rry teldgram of December 20th about Russian intervention in the Tabriz-election&amp; I- have finally got evidence which completely satisfies me that Kuznetzov has officially and persistently demended the election of candidates approved by them. My latest informant is Sigat ul Islami. whom I saw this morning with his brother, the chief Mullah. He told me that the story of Russian intervention went back to the time of Muqaddam and the fact that the General was prepared to lend himself to rigging the elections as they wished was one of the reasons for his disappearance. I gathered from Sigat ul Islami that the Russian list is as given in the telegram mentioned above. It is also a fact that the Russian Consul General has tried to get his support for their list against their acquiescence in his own election. He has himself discussed the whole question with Kuznetzov and explained to him exactly why he cannot play. Especially since the publication of the Tehran declaration about Iranian independence there is a general feeling among the population that the elections must be free and that the era of democratic government is at hand. The Russian wishes can only be realised, according to Sigat ul Islami, if they are prepared, backed with the armed force at their disposal, to force the electorate and those in charge of the elections to ensure the return of their candidates, or, alternative;*; if they can persuade or oblige the Government to rig the elections. In either case there would be disorders. There is now a deadlock. The Russians are not prepare.d to use force and the Government are-&gt;^&lt;7 not prepared to play the Russian game. The situation is not helpe'. by the absence of a Governor General for Ahmadi has no real authority and is as a straw blown by the wind. Sigat ul Islami hopes that Pahimi will soon be sent as Governor General as this may help to influence the Russians. Azudi has apparently kept the Government informed of Russian machinations and Sigat ul Islami may himself be going to Tehran in a few days time for the same • purpose. I have suggested that in this case he might wish to arrange an interview with you. When I first saw the Mullah it was before the Tehran declaration and I sensed his anxiety about ultimate Russian intentions with regard to Azerbaijan. What is now clear to me is that both he and his brother, who are extremely influential locally with a family history going back five hundred years, are anxious to establish the right of holding free elections now of all times when- Iranian independence has just been guaranteed by the Russians among others. If they do not succeed the hopes for the future are pretty slight. There is also the fear I have heard expressed ip other quarters, which they may well share, that the Russians might establish themselves here later as the result of a plebiscite in accordance with t.h e principle that the will of the people must prevail. Allowing them to nominate the people f s representatives at this juncture might well be the first step. Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., CJ. E His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.

Khoyi, member of Election Supervisory Committee and himself a candidate, has provided the following supplementary information regarding Russian interference. According to his story Ahmadi^told the first meeting of the conmittee held after the arrival ot* Azudi that the Russians objected to several candidates including Iskandari, Mamagani and Wahabzadeh. At the second meeting Ahmadi communicated Russian list to the committee. This is as already reported with the addition of Sadigi ex National Bank official and son of a former member of the Majlis. Also stated Russians had no objection to Sigat-ul-lslami provided he supported the candidates on their list. At their last meeting the committee informed the Governor that they wished to publish notice that the elections would be free. Ahmadi subsequently told Khoyi that this could not be done as Russians objected to free election. 2. The same informant states Imami another candidate and member of the committee left for Tehran a few days ago to complain of Russian action. He thinks also that no person on the Russian list would be elected if the elections were free. He considers Abdul Hassan Liqvani stronger candidate than his cousin Issa.

As you may imagine, in the zone of Russian predominance, it isn't easy to find out what one wants to know on such a matter from the people who are in a position to have the facts. Tabrizis in Tehran will probably talk, but Tabrizis at home are always thinking of their unbidden guests. Although all the Persians, officials and non-officials, I have so far met have been extremely friendly most undoubtedly have the feeling that it is in their own interest to avoid being suspected by the Russians of any special association with us, Urquhart's principal Kurd connection, for example, was very reluctant to call here to see me and then appeared equally anxious to cut his visit short. He had, he told me, been questioned by the Russians some time ago as to the nature of his British contacts and feels in consequence that he is now a marked man. It was he who told me that Sadr el-Ghazi had wished to call, but thought it more prudent not to. I believe that Segatul Islami, the ex-deputy, whom I met by chance when paying official calls, would have been round to see me before now but for the same reason. Naturally too the absence of any normal social life here makes contacts more difficult. Although I have exchanged calls with Kuznetzov, have called upon him on a matter connected with the UKCC and also met him at a Russian Red Gross concert I have not been able to have a private conversation with him. He has invariably been accompanied by one of his Vice-Consuls and the last time, whe*n I called on him by appointment without him knowing in advance the nature of my business, all three were present. Nor is it as though an interpreter was necessary. It isn’t of course in this way that real personal relations can be established. The experience is rather like that of being faced by a panel of examiners and conversation languishes, especially when I am questioned on such things as the elections and Yugoslavia. When Kuznetzov asked me what I knew about the elections I parried by telling him that I understood that the notices were shortly to be posted and saying that I hoped they would pass off quietly and freely. He replied by saying that they were entirely a matter for the population, and as he did not offer any other observations the matter dropped, Kuznetzov is, I am sure, a pleasant enough fellow, intelligent too, but one has to compete with the well-known background. Another example of his different outlook was given at the Russian Red Cross concert. The acting Governor- General as patron invited all the consuls to his box which was described as the ”Loge diplomatique'. The Soviet Consulate- General was represented for half the evening by the junior Vice Consul. Kuznetzov did not put in an appearance there at Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. all /1 I I wmm all, though I was able by chance to shake hands with him at the buffet in the interval, Ahmadi, the acting Governor-General, is supposed to be pretty well in the Soviet pocket. I can well believe that he is unlikely to run counter to their wishes in any way. He was Persian Consul in Astrakhan from 1926-1931 and speaks Russian fluently. His wife does too and co-operated closely with Mme. Kuznetzov in the arrangements for the Russian Red Cross concert. I am still intrigued as to why Ahmadi called to see me last Sunday for no apparent cause with the Director of Finance. The latter did owe me a return call, but Ahmadi and I were quits. There was nothing in the conversation to suggest a reason. Was it Majidzadeh who did not wish to call alone, and preferred someone in the Russian confidence, or was it Ahmadi who wished to increase his show o^ friendship and seized an innocuous pretext? I can t find the solution. Yours sincerely, ♦ ■ (Signed) T.C. RAPP. JJCopy. (E 491/94/34). IN CYPHER PROM: No. COPY OP TELEGRAM 1944 ; H.M. CONSUL-GENERAL, TO: H*M. MINISTER TABRIZ.

My information is that Soviet Consul-General visited Azudi the'election Inspector some days ago with his Moslem secretary having first spoken with the Acting Consul-General. An unconfirmed report relates that he informed Azudi that he was interested in the election of the following candidates: Rafii, Liqvani, both former deputies and close supporters of Muqaddam, Mashinchi, Musavi, Ipekchian and Khizi. Of these only Khizi and Musavi appear on official list of Tudeh Persian candidates but it appears very likely that Russians are also backing Armenian candidate Ardashez Ohanessian who is member of the same party and was imprisoned by the ex-Shah as a Bolshevik. If the elections are free only Rafii and Liqvani reasonably certain of election. 2. Other persons on Tudeh Persian local list are Pishavari and Nami, both from Tehran, and Ispahani well known as violently pro-Soviet. Party spending considerable money on election propaganda. 3.

(Personalities No. 35) who will declare the election null and void on the grounds of corruption and undue interference and hold new election. This announcement was the continuation of ataJc which with the Shah yesterday when in summingup I deprecated the departure from the Constitution unless in exceptional circumstances and to gain some much greater advantage than the Shah had shown as likely to accrue. .Today while I said it was for the Shah to make up his own mind, if I was asked fJr ^ advice I mast advise agaiast the plan since I feared that the public would attribute it to a desire to pack t Majlis with the Shah's men and that this would in the long run be bad for the Shah and for Persia, See my immediately following telegram.

I pointed out to the Prime Minister that Kashini is a political suspect for whose arrest the Persian Government themselves have issued warrant and that action could be taken against him under Article 15 (10) of Electoral Law which excludes from elections to Majlis political criminals who have taken action against the State. The Prime Minister, who as usual seemed undecided and nervous of criticism, preferred to take the line that the Majlis should decide whether Kashini if elected should be allowed to take his seat. I replied that election of Kashini would have been resounding victory for the Axis and corresponding defeat of the Allies, Persian Government and Tehran [grp. undec. ? electorate]. 2. It was only when the progress of totals began to be ublished as votes were counted that the danger of election of ashini was seen. Under Persian law there is no list of candidates recognised by the authorities as valid. Anyone can vote for anybody without notice and the fact that an ineligible person, e.g. minor or lunatic is a ’’candidate' is not apparent until voting begins to be counted. 5. After much hesitation the Prime Minister has arranged for the public prosecutor to draw up an indictment of Kashini based on information which I have provided 4 , this indictment will be published and the Government will then instruct election committee to put aside voting cast for Kashini until the case against him is ended.

Information from His Majesty's Consul General tends to bear out report that Soviet Consul General is in fact intervening strongly. The Soviet Chargd d Affaires however some time ago himself asked the Prime Minister to use his influence to prevent election of certain people in various constituencies and to try to secure that of certain candi dates favoured by the Soviet Embassy. It is significant that he did not refer to Azerbaijan althougn he did refer to a number of other parts of the Soviet zone which concern Russia less and even to Tehran Isfahan and Kermanshah. The Prime Minister says that he declined to interfere in Tehran where recent events have since shown that he has in fact not intervened. Prime Minister also claims to have demurred to supporting the other Soviet candidates except one of the Tudeh leaders who was proposed for a constituency in Mazanderan. One of the Soviet recommendations was Dr. Ghani wno has just been made Minister of Health but neither the Prime Minister nor His Majesty’s Legation can understand why. 2. Five candidates vrtio are expected to follow the orders of Tudeh have already been elected and it is possible that some 8 or 10 more may succeed in Northern constituencies. As these deputies vdll constitute the only organised party and will alone have any co herent plan they may exercise considerable influence. ^3. I suspect reason why the new Soviet Ambassador does not come in spite of repeated announcements of his imminent arrival is to give the Soviet Charge d*Affaires time to deal with the election.IN D E X r.

Ahmedi and Tadayyun and to bring in two jf / 'subservient men from the court, Zand, who is comptroller, and •'/+z /•/ General Shafai, one of the aides-de-camp. Appointment of r * 9 Zand has the specious justification that the dmister of Nar ought in theory to be a civilian independent of army intrigues but Zand, is one of the Shah's men and the Shah has openly announced his intention to go back on his recent undertaking to refrain from interference in administration of the army and confine himself to approval or disapproval of appointments and promotions, so the deputies and the iiajlis will not be slow to regard the Cabinet reconstruction as an attempt by the Shah to gain control of the army, and, through the army, of the State. 2. The Prime minister had asked my advice beforehand and I had given opinion to the following effect. Since deputies already elected exceed the quorum so that constitutionally th^ majlis might meet at any time it would be well to wait until then lest the reconstruction of the Cabinet during recess should be considered a trick and the new session should begin with a barren constitutional struggle. I had never had high opinion of the last najlisk but it was both hampered by the fact that it was not properly elected, and by 15 years coquettir with free discussion. The new kajlis would have an easier^ task since there was no longer the need to worry about foreign affairs and several major questions, e.g, income tax law, currency for Allies, engagement of American advisers had been settled. It would be better to give the new iiajlis a*chance. The Prime minister said he entirely agreed with me but feared that the Shah was determined above all to get rid of Ahmedi. 5. i/iinister for Foreign Affairs was also in favour of postponment of 1 eoQxio o ruction of the Cabinet until after the beginning of the new session and he says that he advised the Shah to that effect.

Similarly Paiforce and Government of India have had to be asked to help with civil oil lift in Western and Eastern Persia. 4, Distribution of coal, cotton, piece goods, tea and sugar has been slew; but Millspaugh now realises the need to take effective action and should be able to devote more energy to this problem now that the income tax bill crisis has passed. 5, Drugs.

The quorum for opening its successor is 6y and as already nearly 60 deputies have been elected there should be 69 by or soon after November 25rd. -The practice has however been to postpone the opening until Tehran deputies can take part and as Tehran elections do not begin until November 22nd and may take several weeks there may be a interregnum, 2. -Both the Shah and the Prime Minister wish to use this interval to effect changes in the Government, but their plans differ in that Soheily appears on his own list but not on the Shah s. Soheily wants to strengthen his cabinet by filling two vacancies and replacing two of the worst members by better men. His tentative list is on the whole unobjectionaole but whether he will be allowed to act on it is not certain. .The Shah however is hampered by the difficulty of finding a Prime Minister. Ala has refused and the Shah seems to realise that Saed would be ineffective. p v.Aig one period of crisis a fortnight ago the Shah informed dissidents that on no account would he accept Seyed Zia as Prime Minister. In view of Russian hostility to Seyed Zia this decision was to be expected.

On the receipt of your above mentioned telegram however, and after consulting our security authorities, I told the Prime Minister of our surprise at Y.P.*s appointment as Aide-de-Camp to the Shah in view of widespread expectation of which Kis iiajesty could hardly be unaware, that he would be arrested with the ringleaders of anti-Ally intriguers. According to the Prime Ilinister the Shah expressed surprise at this message but suggest that Y.P. should be sent abroad on some mission. Y.P. would not be a danger as a general with a post under the Ministry of War and Chief of General Staff, but the appointment abroad would be more satisfactory and would moreover save the Shah ! s face, so I am supporting the suggestion. 2. Meanwhile the British Military Attache had seen the Shah and has pressed him strongly to support the Ministry of war and Chief of General Staff, pointing out that the former could be kept within constitutional bounds if General Ridley was given wide powers of control. Tho Shah appeared to find this a nauseous draught but it has done him good. He had been requiring the Minister of i/ar to leave all papers with him for 2 or 3 days to give him time to ,? consider ,, them (actually to enable him to discuss them with Razmara though he swore that Razmara did not see them) but he has now agreed not to retain the papers but to discuss th^m forthwith with the Minister and the Chief of General Staff who will be allowed to take them away* The Shah will never abolish [CYPHER] WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION 1 ^ With th~ C FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE 'Jar cabinet distribution a.6 MOV i343 Sir R.
